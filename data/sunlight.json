      "abstract": "We report on the preparation and characterization of a cost-effective, durable, and reusable macrocomposite, prepared in the form of pellets and designed for the photodegradation of water pollutants, using amoxicillin (AMX) as a model compound. Using the wet impregnation method, kaolin clay and TiO2-P25 composites were doped with copper (Cu2+) and cobalt (Co2+). The produced materials were characterized by SEM-EDS, XRD, XRF, textural property analysis, and their potential lixiviation of components by ICP-MS. The photodegradation efficiency under solar irradiation was evaluated by varying the acidity of the medium, the concentration of AMX, and the amount of catalyst. The performance of the recycled photocatalysts was also studied. The photodegradation of AMX was monitored by UV-Vis and UV-Vis/HPLC spectrophotometry. The optimal formulations, Cu (0.1%)/TiO2 and Co (0.1%)/TiO2, achieved up to 95% degradation of 5 mg·L-1 AMX in 3 h at pH 5.9, with a catalyst loading of 1 g·L-1. The Cu-doped material showed a slightly faster reaction rate and higher total-organic-carbon removal (80.4%) compared to the Co-doped material (59%) under identical conditions. The same photodegradation intermediates were identified by LC-MS/MS for both doped macrocomposites, and a reaction mechanism is proposed. These macrocomposites showed efficient and consistent recyclability over more than five reuse cycles, showing their potential to be used for antibiotic pollution abatement in water-treatment facilities."

This study aims to synthesize silver nanoparticles capped with copper chlorophyllin (AgNPs-CHL) and examine their anti-breast cancer, Musca domestica pesticide, and larvicidal activities. Silver nitrate was the precursor, and CHL was the capping agent. Nanoparticles were characterized using UV-VIS, TEM, XRD, and zeta sizer. The anticancer activity against MDA-MB-231 cells was examined by MTT assay, and flow cytometry was applied to study the mode of cell death. Nanoparticle cellular internalization was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscope. The same nanoparticles were fed to adult Musca domestica followed by sunlight exposure, and the lethality was quantified. Furthermore, the nanoparticles were fed to Musca domestica larvae followed by sunlight illumination, and the number of dead larvae was counted over 24 h. Results revealed success in synthesizing spherical AgNPs with an average diameter of 25 nm. AgNPs-CHL-induced apoptotic cell death in MDA-MB-231 and were sufficiently internalized within the cytoplasm. Sunlight exposure following 24 h of feeding resulted in 60% death of the adult Musca domestica and 75% death of the larvae. This is the first study to demonstrate the multi-activities of the synthesized AgNPs-CHL and encourages further studies."

      "abstract": "The presence of antibiotic residues in water bodies has become a serious environmental concern due to their persistence and ability to cause bacterial resistance. Traditional water treatment methods are often ineffective at completely degrading these pollutants, highlighting the need to investigate more effective remediation methods. In this study, the photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin, a widely used fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was investigated using a novel heterogeneous composite of g-C3N4, CeO2, and Fe3O4 under simulated sunlight irradiation. The composite was synthesized and thoroughly characterized using SEM, EDX, TEM, XRD, BET, PL, RIS, and FT-IR analysis to validate its structural and morphological properties. The effects of key operational parameters, including composite concentration, CeO2 weight percentage, pH, and H2O2 concentration, on photocatalytic performance were investigated. Among all the synthesized composites, the sample with a 0.75:0.75:1 wt ratio (designated as F0.75C0.75 G) displayed the highest photocatalytic activity, achieving a ciprofloxacin removal efficiency of 97.5 % within 180 min. The ternary composite outperformed individual components (g-C3N4, CeO2) and binary composites (g-C3N4/CeO2) due to enhanced charge separation and extended light absorption. In addition, recyclability tests confirmed that the composite maintained high degradation efficiency even after five cycles, highlighting its stability. The treated solution demonstrated excellent biocompatibility, as evidenced by improved lentil seed germination. These findings presents a cost-effective and sustainable approach for the degradation of pharmaceutical pollutants in water resources, offering a promising solution for environmental remediation.",

      "abstract": "Green mold, induced by the fungal phytopathogen Penicillium digitatum, is one of the major causes of postharvest losses in citriculture. To minimize mold infections oranges are treated harshly with fungicides, edible coatings, or physical treatment, leading to evolving resistance, low consumer acceptance, or reduced crop quality, respectively. Photodynamic Inactivation (PDI) might represent an ecofriendly alternative for treatment of P. digitatum spoilage, especially if based on natural photosensitizers. Here, we introduce PDI using three formulations consisting of different concentrations of the natural photosensitizer sodium magnesium chlorophyllin (Chl), Na2EDTA as cell-wall permeabilizing agent and a surfactant for postharvest treatment of P. digitatum. As experimental model systems (i) mycelial spheres in liquid suspension, (ii) fungal spores or (iii) a newly developed experimental setup using orange peel plugs are employed. Illumination was done by an LED device with a main wavelength of 395 nm (106 J cm-2). The lowest concentrated photosensitizer formulation (219 µM Chl) effectively photokilled samples of model systems (i) and (ii) with 100% and 62.5% dead samples, respectively. Orange peel plugs of model system (iii) were best disinfected using the mid-concentrated formulation (475 µM Chl, 70% dead samples). Additionally, model systems (ii) and (iii) were treated with the mid-concentrated formulation and illuminated by sunlight. Eradication of P. digitatum liquid spore culture (ii) was enhanced when illuminating with sunlight (300 J cm-2). Further, a complete disinfection of orange peel plugs (iii, 100% dead samples) was achieved with sunlight (300 J cm-2). To evaluate the antioxidant scavenging activity post-PDI treatment with LED light (395 nm, 106 J cm-2) a DPPH assay was performed on model system (iii). The treatment with the mid- and low-concentrated Chl formulations and LED light showed little to no change in DPPH scavenging activity when compared to the not-illuminated controls. Concisely, with this study we demonstrate that PDI using Chl-based photosensitizer formulations has an in vitro antifungal effect against P. digitatum, without altering the antioxidant scavenging activity of the fruit. Different model systems, to mimic the different stages of green mold infection, were effectively treated with Chl and sunlight."

      "abstract": "The treatment landscape of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has undergone significant evolution, with the introduction of targeted therapies and immunotherapy dramatically altering the management of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. However, the majority of patients, particularly those with microsatellite-stable (MSS) disease, remain refractory to immunotherapy, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes the current treatment options for heavily pretreated mCRC patients who are not eligible for targeted therapies or clinical trials. Approved therapies for refractory mCRC, including regorafenib, trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI), and fruquintinib, demonstrate modest survival benefits but are often associated with significant toxicities. Additionally, innovative approaches targeting specific mutations such as KRAS G12C, HER2 amplification, and BRAF V600E are discussed, highlighting emerging combination regimens with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other agents to overcome resistance mechanisms. The potential of rechallenge strategies using previously administered therapies, such as oxaliplatin and anti-EGFR agents, is examined, supported by retrospective and prospective studies. Furthermore, the role of older drugs like mitomycin C in combination with capecitabine is revisited, offering insights into their viability in advanced treatment settings. Ongoing clinical trials with novel agents and combinations are expected to provide further clarity on optimizing sequential treatment regimens and personalizing therapy for mCRC patients. This review emphasizes the need for comprehensive molecular profiling and shared decision-making to improve outcomes and quality of life in this challenging patient population.",

      "abstract": "The intricate composition of real-world aquatic systems significantly constrains the improved overall performance of powder catalysts, meanwhile their recyclability is inferior to the bulk counterparts (e.g. aerogels). Herein, by loading BiOBr onto g-C3N4 nanosheets and combining them with agarose, an S-scheme heterojunction aerogel (abbreviated as BCA) was synthesized, whose structure was confirmed by the density functional theory calculation. Importantly, the BCA could activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) under simulated sunlight for degrading multi-pollutant. And the BCA/PMS/Light system efficiently degraded various organic contaminants in aqueous environments, achieving a high degradation rate constant of 0.1503 min-1 for rhodamine B (RhB), significantly surpassing the performance of CA/PMS/Light (0.0378 min-1) and BCA/PMS (0.0763 min-1) systems. Free radical quenching experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis reveal that 1O2, •O2-, •OH and SO4•- in the BCA/PMS/Light system were pivotal in RhB degradation, with a dominant non-radical mechanism. Additionally, Fukui function analysis pinpointed the primary reaction sites within the RhB molecule. The photocatalytic heterojunction aerogel exhibits outstanding stability, environmental sustainability and versatility, which can guide the development of simulated sunlight-driven PMS activation for multi-pollutant degradation, catering for scalable water treatment applications."

      "abstract": "Oca (Oxalis tuberosa), a potato like crops, is cultivated extensively in the high altitude regions of the Andes. Traditionally, consumers have used sunlight to enhance the sweetness of oca and have used methods to produce a dehydrated product known as 'khaya' for its preservation. This research seeks to assess the chemical and nutritional changes that four oca cultivars undergo after exposure to sunlight and traditional dehydration techniques. The results of the study indicate that exposure of freshly harvested oca to sunlight contributes to antioxidant capacity, increased concentration of polyphenols, carotenoids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and an overall improvement in nutritional properties characterized by a reduction in oxalate content and a significant increase in sugar concentration. On the other hand, dehydration byproducts are associated with a decrease in antioxidant capacity and polyphenols, a reduction in oxalate content and is accompanied by an increase in amylopectin. The changes in sugar content depend on the specific dehydration treatment used. Taken together, these results suggest that exposure of oca to sunlight not only improves its chemical and nutritional profile, but also contributes to an overall improvement in quality. On the other hand, dehydration of oca serves as a preservation technique, extending its shelf life while maintaining certain nutritional properties. This research provides valuable insights into optimizing the post-harvest handling of oca to improve quality and prolong shelf life.",

      "abstract": "The reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplification caused by inevitable plasma albumin encapsulation is still a challenge to circumvent the systemic adverse effects in the photodynamic therapy (PDT) process. Herein, a disulfide bond linked homodimer, Cy1280, which is modulated by albumin to accurately balance the fluorescence and ROS generation and exhibit a weak fluorescence and sealed PDT effect during blood circulation, is exploited. Cy1280 can be specifically internalized and dispersed at the tumor site via Organic Anion Transporter Proteins (OATPs) and thiol-disulfide exchange mediated synergistic uptake and activated after mild sunlight irradiation (100 ± 5 Klx) to sensitize neighboring oxygen in cellular mitochondria to execute direct protein dysfunction effect. The dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) facilitates prolonged and sustained retention in tumors (>336 h) and demonstrates the efficacy of imaging-guided solid-tumor therapy in tumor-bearing BALB/C mice. This study resolves the inevitable stubborn impotent tumor penetration caused by bulky-sized nanoparticles and high interstitial pressure of tumor with synergistic uptake manner, the long-term circulation and sealed PDT manipulated with albumin also improve the whole body phototoxic symptom. The advantageous feature of Cy1280 provides a promising candidate for overcoming the off-target phototoxicity and inadequate accumulation challenges in clinical translation with photosensitizers (PSs).",

      "abstract": "Global food production faces persistent threats from environmental challenges and pathogenic attacks, leading to significant yield losses. Conventional strategies to combat pathogens, such as fungicides and disease-resistant breeding, are limited by environmental contamination and emergence of pathogen resistance. Herein, we engineered sunlight-sensitive and biodegradable carbon dots (CDs) capable of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), offering a novel and sustainable approach for plant protection. Our study demonstrates that CDs function as dual-purpose materials: priming plant immune responses and serving as broad-spectrum antifungal agents. Foliar application of CDs generated ROS under light, and the ROS could damage the plant cell wall and trigger cell wall-mediated immunity. Immune activation enhanced plant resistance against pathogens without compromising photosynthetic efficiency or yield. Specifically, spray treatment with CDs at 240 mg/L (2 mL per plant) reduced the incidence of grey mould in N. benthamiana and tomato leaves by 44% and 12%, respectively, and late blight in tomato leaves by 31%. Moreover, CDs (480 mg/L, 1 mL) combined with continuous sunlight irradiation (simulated by xenon lamp, 9.4 × 105 lux) showed a broad-spectrum antifungal activity. The inhibition ratios for mycelium growth were 66.5% for P. capsici, 8% for S. sclerotiorum and 100% for B. cinerea, respectively. Mechanistic studies revealed that CDs effectively inhibited mycelium growth by damaging hyphae and spore structures, thereby disrupting the propagation and vitality of pathogens. These findings suggest that CDs offer a promising, eco-friendly strategy for sustainable crop protection, with potential for practical agricultural applications that maintain crop yields and minimize environmental impact."

      "abstract": "Applying biogas slurry containing antibiotics as organic fertilizer to farmland can lead to the accumulation of antibiotics in the soil and access the water environment further through surface runoff and leachate, posing a potential risk to the regional water environment. In this study, photocatalysis was performed to degrade the antibiotics in biogas slurry employing g-C3N4 as a catalyst under visible light and sunlight. g-C3N4 was prepared by simple thermal polymerization at different temperatures and times with cheap urea and melamine, respectively, and the yield, structural characterization, and photocatalytic performance were analyzed. The results showed that the yield of g-C3N4 prepared by melamine (MCN) was 31.5 times higher than that of g-C3N4 prepared by urea (UCN), and decreasing the calcination temperature and time could effectively increase the yield of UCN. The TEM images indicated that UCN possessed a porous nanosheet structure with a specific surface area (74.91 m2/g) that was 4.41 times higher than that of MCN (16.99 m2/g). The UCN550 showed favorable photocatalytic properties under visible light and sunlight, especially the removal of tetracyclines (TCs) from biogas slurry reached 94.43% after 30 min of photocatalysis under sunlight. The comparative study revealed that UCN550-1 exhibited favorable catalytic performance for antibiotics in real wastewater, and it showed great promise in terms of synthesis, efficiency, cost, and engineering applications. This study can provide a reference for the harmless treatment of biogas slurry and the engineering application of sunlight photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics in real complex water quality systems.",

      "abstract": "Developing multifunctional water purification materials is of great significance for the elimination of organic pollutants and bacterial pathogens in industrial wastewater. Herein, we report a novel green material, bacterial cellulose/molybdenum disulfide/titanium oxide (BC/MoS2/TiO2) composite film, through one-step in situ biosynthesis, and its application in industrial wastewater treatment. The systematic physicochemical characterization of BC/MoS2/TiO2 demonstrated that MoS2 and TiO2 were effectively incorporated into the BC porous network matrix. Meanwhile, BC/MoS2/TiO2 was absorbed in the UV, visible, and NIR regions with a bandgap of 1.93 eV, indicating that it can serve as a sunlight-excited photocatalyst. Further photocatalytic studies revealed that the synergistic effect of MoS2 and TiO2 enabled BC/MoS2/TiO2 to generate large amounts of •OH and O2•-, and the potential photocatalytic mechanism was investigated. Additionally, BC/MoS2/TiO2 exhibited higher photodegradation efficiencies against methylene blue (k = 0.01963 min-1) and rhodamine B (k = 0.01844 min-1), as well as better photodynamic and photothermal antibacterial performances against Staphylococcus aureus (99.9929%) and Escherichia coli (99.8935%) than BC/MoS2 or BC/TiO2 alone. BC/MoS2/TiO2 showed great reusability and maintained its effectiveness after four cycles. Overall, these results revealed that the biosynthesized BC/MoS2/TiO2 achieved favorable photodegradation of organic dye pollutants via a type I photodynamic pathway under sunlight illumination and synergistic photothermal and photodynamic antimicrobial activity, thus suggesting that this mild, green, and sustainable composite is a promising material for efficient antibacterial and degradation of industrial wastewater constituents.",

      "abstract": "The bionanomaterial for wastewater treatment attracts interest due to it is nontoxic and biodegradable. However, it has limitations cause of the weak chemical interaction, narrow surface area, and reusability of this material. In this study, a novel bionanomaterial for wastewater treatment was developed using a nontoxic and biodegradable carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) base. To overcome the limitations of weak chemical interactions affecting its adsorption capacity and reusability, chitosan (CS) and ZnO nanoparticles with photocatalytic properties were incorporated. The resulting ZnO/CS/CMC nanocomposite exhibits dual functionality as a photocatalyst and adsorbent, enhancing the removal of methylene blue (MB) from wastewater. The material's morphology and physicochemical properties were thoroughly characterized using SEM, TEM, FTIR, XRD, BET, and DLS techniques. The molar ratio of ZnO (0.5-1.5) significantly influenced the nanocomposite's characteristics, with higher ZnO ratios producing a highly homogeneous spherical morphology and increased surface area. At a ZnO ratio of 1.5, the nanocomposite achieved outstanding photocatalytic performance, degrading 99.5 % of MB in just 60 min under sunlight irradiation. Additionally, the highest adsorption capacity of 4.66 mg g-1 followed the Langmuir isotherm model. This study highlights the enhanced MB removal efficiency due to the synergistic effect of ZnO particles and the supportive matrix. The developed material offers an eco-friendly, efficient, and sustainable solution for wastewater treatment, combining high performance with the benefits of biodegradability and reusability.",

      "abstract": "Edible oils are essential dietary components that provide crucial micronutrients. However, their quality can deteriorate during frying-a common cooking method-and with prolonged light exposure due to chemical reactions such as hydrolysis, oxidation, and polymerization. These processes lead to the formation of harmful compounds, particularly aldehydes. This study investigates how thermal and light exposure impact the chemical composition of five widely used edible oils: olive, rapeseed, sunflower, sesame, and peanut oils. For the thermal treatment, the oils were heated to 190 ± 5 °C in a commercial fryer, with samples taken at the start and after 10 min and 60 min of heating, while intermittently frying chicken nuggets to simulate typical frying conditions. For the light exposure treatment, the oil samples were exposed to direct sunlight for 3 and 8 h, with control samples being collected beforehand. The oil composition was analyzed using an advanced 800 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument with a triple-resonance inverse cryoprobe, providing high sensitivity and resolution. The results revealed a significant increase in various aldehyde compounds in all oils under both thermal and light exposure conditions. Notably, this study identified the generation of genotoxic and cytotoxic α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, including 4-hydroperoxy-(E)-2-alkenals, 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-alkenals, and 4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-alkenals. Given the established association of aldehydes with health risks, including cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases, these findings highlight the importance of monitoring oil degradation during cooking and the appropriate storage of oils to minimize light exposure to reduce potential health risks."

This analysis of SUNLIGHT investigated the impact of treatment with FTD/TPI + bevacizumab on patient quality of life (QoL) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS). METHODS: Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L) and ECOG PS assessments were conducted at baseline and on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. Time to definitive deterioration (TTDD) of QoL and time to ECOG PS worsening between treatment arms was assessed. A repeated-measures mixed-effects model was used to compare changes in QoL and ECOG PS from baseline. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to assess TTDD of QoL, time to ECOG PS worsening to ≥ 2, and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients maintaining an ECOG PS of 0-1. RESULTS: Both treatment arms showed similar QoL scores from baseline to cycle 6, with no clinically relevant change over time. Patients receiving FTD/TPI + bevacizumab had a longer TTDD of QoL than patients receiving FTD/TPI, as well as longer time to ECOG PS worsening. In patients with maintained ECOG PS, median OS and PFS was prolonged in the FTD/TPI + bevacizumab arm compared to the FTD/TPI arm. CONCLUSION: This analysis of SUNLIGHT showed that patients treated with FTD/TPI + bevacizumab had no clinically relevant changes in QoL, and prolonged TTDD and time to ECOG PS worsening, compared to patients treated with FTD/TPI."

      "abstract": "Electronic waste (e-waste) has become a significant environmental concern worldwide due to the rapid advancement of technology and short product lifecycles. Waste-printed electronic boards (WPCBs) contain valuable metals and semiconductors; among them, tin can be recycled and repurposed for sustainable material production. This study presents a potential ecofriendly methodology for the recovery of tin from WPCBs in the form of tin oxide nanostructured powders. The soldering points in the WPCBs are extracted and dissolved in the dilute HNO3 solution, followed by the formation of metastannic acid, which is subsequently transformed into SnO2 nanoparticles. Different characterization techniques (XRD, XPS, FE-SEM, and TEM) are employed to confirm the morphology and composition of nanoparticles. The prepared SnO2 NPs, having a size range of <50 nm, show excellent photocatalytic degradation of cationic (methylene blue, MB) and anionic (eosin Y, EY) dyes for wastewater treatment. The as-synthesized SnO2 can degrade the mixed dyes (MB+EY) under the illumination of natural sunlight at rate constants of 0.0153 and 0.1103 min-1 for MB and EY, respectively. The positive zeta potential and smaller particle size of the SnO2 NPs possess the extra advantage of the adsorption of anionic over cationic dye, resulting in faster degradation of EY, which is further supported by DFT calculation. The synthesis of SnO2 from waste-printed electronic boards offers a dual benefit: It not only provides a sustainable solution for managing electronic waste but also contributes to the production of useful photocatalysts for wastewater treatment. By converting waste into valuable resources, this approach aligns with the principles of the circular economy and mitigates the environmental impact associated with e-waste disposal."

      "abstract": "This study presents the development and characterization of manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4)-based nanocomposites with graphite oxide (GO) and chitosan (CS) for efficient dye removal from textile wastewater and aqueous solution. Comprehensive characterization was performed using FT-IR, Raman, XRD, BET, SEM, DRS and Zeta potential techniques. XRD analysis confirmed the cubic spinel structure of MnFe2O4, with characteristic peaks at 2θ = 32, 35, 48, 53, 62, and 64°. BET analysis revealed a high specific surface area of 442.57 m2/g and a pore diameter of 2.36 nm for the MnFe2O4/GO/CS nanocomposite. SEM imaging showed polyhedral MnFe2O4 particles (11-33 nm) deposited on a wrinkled graphite oxide matrix. DRS analysis indicated band gap energies of 3.1 eV for MnFe2O4, 3.0 eV for MnFe2O4/GO, and 3.5 eV for MnFe2O4/GO/CS. Zeta potential measurements showed a positive surface charge (+ 36.8 mV) for MnFe2O4/GO/CS. The MnFe2O4/GO/CS nanocomposite exhibited exceptional photocatalytic performance under UV light irradiation. It achieved 99.9 and 99.5% removal of Reactive Red 198 dye and Brilliant Blue FCF 133, respectively. The photocatalytic process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics (R2 = 0.99). In real textile wastewater treatment, the nanocomposite reduced BOD from 889 to 0.86 mg/L and COD from 1227 to 74 mg/L, with 96% dye removal. Also, MnFe2O4/GO/CS showed excellent performance under sunlight irradiation and maintained high removal efficiencies over multiple cycles, demonstrating good reusability. This study highlights the potential of the MnFe2O4-based nanocomposites as versatile and sustainable solutions for remediating dye-contaminated water."

Known for their stability and adjustable conductivity, PANI nanoparticles were synthesized via a hydrothermal method using P123 surfactants, followed by calcination. The morphology, structural phase, and optical properties of the synthesized PANI materials were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results indicated that the synthesized PANI nanoparticles agglomerated into spherical particles with an average size of 70-80 nm. The photocatalytic properties of PANI materials were evaluated by the decolorization of rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) under simulated sunlight irradiation. The PANI photocatalyst was found to be highly effective in removing MB dye, achieving a removal efficiency of approximately 97.09% with a rate constant of 2.08 × 10-2 min-1. In comparison, the removal efficiency for RhB was about 58.01%. Additionally, the mechanism behind the photocatalytic degradation of MB dye by PANI was investigated and discussed. The study highlights the photostability and reproducibility of PANI nanoparticles through recycling experiments, contributing to the development of sustainable photocatalytic materials for efficient water treatment."

Subsequently, molybdate and vanadium oxide were added to the prepared powders to create composite photocatalysts with reduced bandgap energy, enhancing light absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, which is essential for effective photocatalytic activity using sunlight. The synthesized powders were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and specific surface area using the BET method. The crystallization and anatase-to-rutile phase transformation of the powders were verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the composite nanoparticles were further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The photocatalytic activity of the F-doped commercial TiO2, sol-gel synthesized TiO2, and prepared composite powders was evaluated through the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) in water under ultraviolet (UV), UV-visible, and sunlight irradiation. The results indicated that the incorporation of Molybdenum and Vanadium significantly influenced the photocatalytic efficiency by substantially reducing the bandgap of this composite photocatalyst. The LiF-doped TiO2 powders synthesized by sol-gel using TTIP, and doped with vanadium and molybdenum, activated by sunlight, exhibited high performance in MB degradation compared to commercial TiO2 and undoped synthesized TiO2 powders, achieving an optimal degradation rate of 7.26 × 10⁻⁹ mol per gram of photocatalyst."

The theme of the present investigation is the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye using economically produced Cu2-XSe nanoparticles (NPs) catalyst under solar radiations. The Cu2-XSe NPs crystallized in the cubic structural phase with an average crystallite size around 19 nm. The direct band gap was found to be 2.1 eV. The PL spectra and corresponding CIE diagram show the Cu2-xSe NPs emitted yellow color. The SEM micrographs show that the small grains staked over others to form large grains or patches. The FTIR and EDX spectra confirmed the formation of Cu2-XSe NPs. The obtained optimum photocatalytic degradation efficiency for Cu2-XSe NPs is 90.3 %. For first cycle analysis. The pseudo-first order and second order models were used to analyze the kinetic data of Cu2-XSe NPs for varying concentrations. The multiple-cycle degradation analysis by catalyst of MB dye in one day spam for continuous four cycles were also analysed and discussed. The sun light driven multi-cycle catalytic degradation confirms the re-usability of Cu2-xSe NPs for the treatment of industrial waste water and other contaminated water bodies for the survival of aquatic life and for saving environment."

      "abstract": "Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which leads to the formation of mutagenic and cytotoxic DNA lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPs), can be potentially fatal. The way UVA forms DNA lesions and alters DNA topology and mechanics is still unclear, unlike the cases of UVC and UVB. Herein, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and AFM-based Force Spectroscopy (AFS) have been employed to investigate the topological and mechanical properties of single DNA molecules, bare or E. coli cell-encapsulated, with or without UVA (solar or from UV lamp) treatment. It is observed that both the dsDNA transitions, i.e., 'B' to stretched 'S' conformation and melting transition, are lost in UVA dose-dependent manner. Presumably, this is due to formation of the CPDs and 6-4 lesions that form inter-strand cross-links, causing dsDNA strand separation difficult. Gradual reduction in DNA extension length upon prolonged treatment with UVA-only radiation or sunlight (where, 95 % of solar UV is UVA) also indicates formation of the inter-strand cross-links, since such cross-links can reduce DNA flexibility and increase DNA stiffness. Although these observations are common for both bare and cell-encapsulated DNA, the UVA dose at which the distinctive reversible B-S and melting transition faded away varied widely from 240 kJ/m2 (bare DNA) to 900 kJ/m2 (cellular DNA). The UV-induced DNA damage was also evident in observation of increased number of open circular and linearized topologies, as formed due to single-strand and double-strand breaks, respectively, at damage sites, upon combined action of the apurinic/apyrimidinic site-specific endonucleases IV and V. The extent of DNA damage was further quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which is found to be correlated to the single molecule information.",

A green ZnO/g-C3N4 nanocomposite (NC) is used as a photocatalyst coating on glass to investigate the inactivation of CIP in water, in a flow-reactor configuration at small-prototype scale (10 liters/h, catalyst area 187.5 cm2). ZnO/g-C3N4 NC coatings were obtained by an in-situ thermal condensation process coupled with a green synthesis protocol and deposited on glass, via a simple drop casting method. Morphological and structural analyses of synthesized composites were performed with Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, while optical properties were studied with Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS). The degradation of CIP was first tested at a lab scale under simulated sunlight and then studied under sunlight in a parabolic trough concentrator (PTC). Suitable degradation of CIP (100%) was observed at 210 min via High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and the by-products were determined by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS). Microbiological tests revealed the absence of antibacterial activity in CIP water treated with ZnO/g-C3N4 NC photocatalyst against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Priestia megaterium. Our results directly demonstrate the effective inactivation of CIP with a process designed for sustainability both in terms of energy input (solar) and scalability of materials. Also, the small-prototype scale of this investigation provides insights into the challenges arising from the perspective scale-up to an industrial application, aimed at antibiotics inactivation in wastewater and thus helping to prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).",

While chromotherapy, particularly blue light exposure, has historical roots in traditional medicine and its specific impact on blood pressure regulation remains understudied. So, the present study aims to investigate the immediate impact of exposure to blue glass through sunlight on blood pressure in hypertensive individuals. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was carried out with a sample of 60 hypertensive patients, who were divided into two groups: a study group that received blue glass exposure for 20 min and a control group that received exposure to colourless glass. The primary outcome measures were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation levels. RESULTS: The results of the study revealed statistically significant differences in systolic blood pressure (p=0.006) and pulse rate (p=0.005) after the intervention in the study group and no such changes were noted in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that blue glass exposure has a significant impact on reducing blood pressure and pulse rate in hypertensive patients, indicating its potential use as a integrative treatment in the management of hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Flexible thermoelectric generators (TEGs) with pn-junction single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films on a polyimide substrate have attracted considerable attention for energy harvesting. This is because they generate electricity through the photo-thermoelectric effect by self-generated temperature gradient under uniform sunlight irradiation. To increase the performance and durability of the pn-junction TEGs, n-type films need to be improved as a priority. In this study, bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) nanoplates synthesized by the solvothermal method were added to the n-type SWCNT films, including a cationic surfactant to form the nanocomposite films because Bi2Te3 has high n-type thermoelectric properties and high durability. The performances of the pn-junction TEGs were investigated by varying the heat treatment times. When the artificial sunlight was uniformly irradiated to the pn-junction TEGs, a stable output voltage of 0.47 mV was observed in the TEG with nanocomposite films heat-treated at 1 h. The output voltage decreased with increasing heat treatment time due to the decrease in the p-type region. The output voltage of TEG at 1 h is higher than that of the TEGs without Bi2Te3 nanoplates under the same conditions. Therefore, the addition of Bi2Te3 nanoplates was found to improve the performance of the pn-junction TEGs. These findings may aid in the development of facile and flexible optical devices, including photodetectors and hybrid devices integrating solar cells."

      "abstract": "We present the case of a 61-year-old woman with a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of plaque morphea. The disease began about four years ago with the appearance of a single oval sclerotic plaque located on the front surface of the right lower leg. After topical treatment, the plaque underwent reverse development. Two years later, after intense exposure to the sun, reactivation of the plaque occurred with the development of a peripheral reddening of the \"lilac ring\" type, thickening, and induration of the affected skin. After topical treatment, the plaque regressed again after six months. The next summer, the patient regularly used topical photoprotective agents and avoided prolonged exposure to solar radiation, during which no new reactivation of the plaque occurred. The observed case suggests that UV light (sunlight) could be a triggering factor for the reactivation of plaque morphea."

In this study, a high-performance aerogel adsorbent composed of polyimide (PI), hydroxyapatite nanowires (HAPnws), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been fabricated, which leverages reduced flow tortuosity through anisotropic structures and solar-assisted viscosity reduction via photothermal materials. The prepared anisotropic PI/HAP/rGO aerogel, with directional channels, shows unique mechanical properties with high stiffness along the axial direction and compressibility along the radial direction. PI/HAP/rGO, featuring vertically aligned channels, demonstrated superior adsorption efficiency (the adsorption coefficient K s reached 0.37 kg m-1 s-1/2 for an engine oil with a viscosity of ~144 mPa·s) for oil of varying viscosities compared to similar aerogels with uniform pores, because of the substantially reduced flow tortuosity. The photothermal properties of rGO further enhance the adsorption speed of PI/HAP/rGO for viscous oil under sunlight, including crude oil with ultrahigh viscosity. In addition, PI/HAP/rGO exhibits excellent fire resistance, allowing for reusability via both adsorption-compression and adsorption-combustion cycles. The robust and compressible PI/HAP/rGO aerogels with high adsorption efficiency for viscous oil and fire resistance represent an ideal solution for practical oil spill treatment, and this approach also offers inspiration for the development of advanced adsorbent materials."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare inherited metabolic disease, causing lifelong painful phototoxic reactions, minimal sunlight exposure, and vitamin D deficiency. Previous studies reported a high osteoporosis prevalence in EPP patients. The objective is to identify those at risk for low bone mineral density (BMD) and assess which factors, including treatment with cholecalciferol and afamelanotide, improve BMD in EPP. METHODS: A longitudinal ambispective single centre cohort study. Data from patient files and two-time questionnaires from adult patients with EPP who underwent at least one dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan between 2012 and 2023 were used. RESULTS: BMD is low in EPP patients, with 82.7% of the139 patients having a Z-score below 0 standard deviation (SD) at baseline. Low BMD classified as osteopenia was found in 39.5%, and osteoporosis in 15.3%. There were 50 osteoporosis-related fractures in 34.2% of patients. Aging (OR 1.08; CI: 1.03-1.12), persistent vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.11; 95% CI: 1.00-1.23) and a low body-mass index(OR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.82-0.99) increased the odds of low BMD. Patients with a vitamin D deficiency (OR 5.51; 95% CI: 1.69-17.92) and no cholecalciferol at baseline (OR 0.22; 95% CI: 0.04-1.34) had the highest odds of improving their BMD. Afamelanotide did not improve BMD. CONCLUSIONS: 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status plays a crucial role in both preventing low BMD and improving BMD. EPP is a natural model for lack of sunlight exposure and vitamin D deficiency, underlining the importance of lifelong adequate vitamin D status for bone health in the general population."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Depression is common in people with visual impairment, and the onset may be influenced by aspects related to light. The aim was to explore the associations of season, sunlight, and light sensitivity with depressive symptoms in this population. METHODS: Data regarding self-reported depressive symptoms from seven cross-sectional studies conducted between 2009 and 2018 were combined with information concerning sensitivity to light, season on the date of self-report, and potential sunlight exposure in the 2 weeks prior to self-report. The latter was calculated by summing up the daily sunlight hours detected by the weather station nearest to the residence of each participant. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations. RESULTS: Participants (N = 1925) experienced clinically significant depressive symptoms most often in winter (32.8%), followed by summer (27.4%), spring (26.2%), and fall (24.2%). The odds of experiencing depression in fall were significantly lower compared with winter (odds ratio [OR] = 0.67, P = 0.007). An increase in the hours of sunlight in the participant's environment was associated with lower odds to experience depressive symptoms (OR = 0.995, P = 0.011). People who were sensitive to bright light had higher odds of experiencing depressive symptoms (OR = 1.80, P < 0.001). Other differences found between subgroups were not consistent. CONCLUSIONS: It seems likely that season, sunlight, and light sensitivity play a role in depression among people with visual impairment. Further research is needed, exploring the experiences in this population, the actual sunlight exposure using objective measures, and treatment options. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Clinicians should consider these factors when treating visually impaired patients with depressive symptoms.",

The structural and morphological features of the Alg/CuO-gC₃N₄ was characterized using different techniques namely Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV Diffuse Reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The photocatalytic activity of the Alg/CuO-gC₃N₄ was extensively evaluated by degrading methylene blue (MB) under UV-vis and sunlight irradiation. The influence of various parameters like pollutant type, initial dye concentration, catalyst dosage, effect of pH, light intensity and reusability was investigated. The Alg/CuO-gC₃N₄ achieved a maximum degradation efficiency of 86.26 % and 85.15 % for MB at a dye concentration of 1 × 10-5 M under UV-vis and sunlight irradiation respectively, within 60 min using 0.3 wt% of catalyst dosage. The Alg/CuO-gC₃N₄ exhibited excellent stability and reusability over multiple cycles. Additionally, the incorporation of CuO-gC₃N₄ in alginate facilitates in reducing the bandgap (2.54 to 2.28 eV) for efficient charge separation, further enhancing the overall photocatalytic activity."

      "abstract": "WHAT IS THIS SUMMARY ABOUT?: This is a summary describing the results from a phase 3 clinical trial called SUNLIGHT. The study looked at treatment with orally administered trifluridine/tipiracil plus intravenously administered bevacizumab in people with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that is refractory to treatment.This study included people whose cancer had grown or spread beyond its original location after no more than two previous treatments. People in the study received either the combination of trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab or they received trifluridine/tipiracil alone. The aims of the study were to see how long people lived after treatment with trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab compared with trifluridine/tipiracil alone and to find out how well the combination of trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab worked at slowing down the spread of the cancer. Researchers also looked at side effects from taking the medicines and at how treatment affected people's physical functioning. WHAT ARE THE KEY TAKEAWAYS?: People in the combination group lived longer (a median of 10.8 months) than people who received trifluridine/tipiracil alone (7.5 months). In addition, the time it took for the cancer to worsen was longer for those who received the combination treatment (a median of 5.6 months) compared with those who received trifluridine/tipiracil alone (2.4 months). People's physical functioning took longer to worsen with combination therapy (a median of 9.3 months) than it did with trifluridine/tipiracil alone (6.3 months), as measured by the impact of treatment on people's ability to carry out daily living activities. The most common side effects in both treatment groups were low levels of white blood cells, known as neutrophils (neutropenia), nausea, and low levels of healthy red blood cells (anemia). WHAT WERE THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS REPORTED BY THE RESEARCHERS?: The results from the study suggest that treatment with oral trifluridine/tipiracil plus intravenous (IV) bevacizumab could help people with refractory mCRC live longer and maintain good physical functioning, and it could slow the worsening of their cancer.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT04737187 (SUNLIGHT) (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

      "abstract": "The fouling phenomenon of membranes has hindered the rapid development of separation technology in wastewater treatment. The integration of materials into membranes with both excellent separation performance and self-cleaning properties still pose challenges. Here, a self-assembled composite membrane with solar-driven self-cleaning performance is reported for the treatment of complex oil-water emulsions. The mechanical robustness of the composite membrane is enhanced by the electrostatic attraction between chitosan and metal-organic frameworks (MOF) CuCo-HHTP as well as the crosslinking effect of glutaraldehyde. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations also revealed the hydrogen bonding interaction between chitosan and CuCo-HHTP. The composite membrane of CuCo-HHTP-5@CS/MPVDF exhibits a high flux ranging from 700.6 to 2350.6 L∙m-2∙h-1∙bar-1 and excellent separation efficiency (>99.0%) for various oil-water emulsions, including crude oil, kerosene, and other light oils. The addition of CuCo-HHTP shows remarkable photothermal effects, thus demonstrating excellent solar-driven self-cleaning capability and antibacterial performance (with an efficiency of ≈100%). Furthermore, CuCo-HHTP-5@CS/MPVDF can activate peroxomonosulfate (PMS) under sunlight, quickly removing oil-fouling and dyes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the bimetallic sites of Cu and Co in CuCo-HHTP effectively promoted the activation of PMS. This study provides distinctive insights into the multifaceted applications of MOFs-derived photothermal anti-fouling composite membranes."

Herein, we investigated the photolysis of NPX in aqueous solution exposed to both ultraviolet (UV, 254 nm) and natural sunlight irradiation. Results show that N2 purging significantly promoted NPX photolysis under UV irradiation, suggesting the formation of excited triplet state (3NPX*) as a critical transient. This inference was supported by benzophenone photosensitization and transient absorption spectra. Sunlight quantum yield of NPX was only one fourteenth of that under UV irradiation, suggesting the wavelength-dependence of NPX photochemistry. 3NPX* formed upon irradiation of NPX underwent photodecarboxylation leading to the formation of 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-6-methoxynaphthalene (2HE6MN), 2-(1-hydroperoxyethyl)-6-methoxynaphthalene (2HPE6MN), and 2-acetyl-6-methoxynaphthalene (2A6MN). Notably, the conjugation and spin-orbit coupling effects of carbonyl make 2A6MN a potent triplet sensitizer, therefore promoting the photodegradation of the parent NPX. In hospital wastewater, the photolysis of NPX was influenced because the photoproduct 2A6MN and wastewater components could competitively absorb photons. Bioluminescence inhibition assay demonstrated that photoproducts of NPX exhibited higher toxicity than the parent compound. Results of this study provide new insights into the photochemical behaviors of NPX during UV treatment and in sunlit surface waters.",

      "abstract": "As an eco-friendly and sustainable energy, solar energy has great application potential in water treatment. Herein, simulated sunlight was for the first time utilized to activate monochloramine for the degradation of environmental organic microcontaminants. Various microcontaminants could be efficiently degraded in the simulated sunlight/monochloramine system. The average innate quantum yield of monochloramine over the wavelength range of simulated sunlight was determined to be 0.068 mol/Einstein. With the determined quantum yield, a kinetic model was established. Based on the good agreement between the simulated and measured photolysis and radical contributions to the degradation of ibuprofen and carbamazepine, the major mechanism of monochloramine activation by simulated sunlight was proposed. Chlorine radical (Cl∙) and hydroxyl radical (HO∙) were major radicals responsible for microcontaminant degradation in the system. Moreover, the model facilitated a deep investigation into the effects of different reaction conditions (pH, monochloramine concentration, and water matrix components) on the degradation of ibuprofen and carbamazepine, as well as the roles of the involved radicals. The differences between simulated and measured degradation data of each microcontaminant under all conditions were less than 10 %, indicating the strong reliability of the model. The model could also make good prediction for microcontaminant degradation in the natural sunlight/monochloramine system. Furthermore, the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) was evaluated at different oxidation time in simulated sunlight/monochloramine with and without post-chloramination treatment. In real waters, organic components showed more pronounced suppression on microcontaminant degradation efficiency than inorganic ions. This study provided a systematic investigation into the novel sunlight-induced monochloramine activation system for efficient microcontaminant degradation, and demonstrated the potential of the system in practical applications.",

In this regard, Co0.33Mg0.33Ni0.33SmxFe2-xO4 (0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.08) nanoparticles were prepared to examine their magnetic separation efficiency (MSE), photocatalytic, antibacterial, and antibiofilm performances. Pure nanoparticles, having the highest saturation magnetization (Ms = 31.87 emu/g), exhibit the highest MSE, where 95.6% of nanoparticles were separated after 20 min of applying a magnetic field of 150 mT. The catalytic performance of the prepared samples is examined by the photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) dye exposed to direct sunlight radiation. Improved photocatalytic activity is exhibited by Co0.33Mg0.33Ni0.33Sm0.04Fe1.96O4 nanoparticles, labeled as Sm0.04, where the rate of the degradation reaction is enhanced by 4.1 times compared to pure nanoparticles. Rising the pH and reaction temperature improves the rate of the photodegradation reaction of RhB. The incorporation of 15 wt% reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with Sm0.04 enhanced the rate of the reaction by 1.7 and 2.4 times compared with pure Sm0.04 sample and rGO, respectively. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against Escherichia coli, Leclercia adecarboxylata, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium are assessed by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) broth microdilution, the agar well diffusion, the time-kill assays, the biofilm formation, and destruction assays. The bacteria used in these assessments are isolated from wastewater. The nanoparticles exhibit a bacteriostatic activity, with a better effect against the Gram-positive isolates. Co0.33Mg0.33Ni0.33SmxFe2O4 (x = 0.00) nanoparticles have the best effect. The effect is exerted after 2-3 h of incubation. Gram-positive biofilms are more sensitive to nanoparticles.",

      "abstract": "The coexistence of free chlorine and bromide under sunlight irradiation (sunlight/FC with Br-) is unavoidable in outdoor seawater swimming pools, and the formation of brominated disinfection byproducts could act more harmful than chlorinated disinfection byproducts. In this study, benzotriazole was selected as a model compound to investigate the degradation rate and the subsequent formation of disinfection byproducts via sunlight/FC with Br- process. The rate constants for the degradation of benzotriazole under pseudo first order conditions in sunlight/FC with Br- and sunlight/FC are 2.3 ± 0.07 × 10-1 min-1 and 6.0 ± 0.7 × 10-2 min-1, respectively. The enhanced degradation of benzotriazole can be ascribed to the generation of HO•, bromine species, and reactive halogen species (RHS) during sunlight/FC with Br-. Despite the fact that sunlight/FC with Br- process enhanced benzotriazole degradation, the reaction results in increasing tribromomethane (TBM) formation. A high concentration (37.8 μg/L) of TBM was detected in the sunlight/FC with Br-, which was due to the reaction of RHS. The degradation of benzotriazole was notably influenced by the pH value (pH 4 - 11), the concentration of bromide (0 - 2 mM), and free chlorine (1 - 6 mg/L). Furthermore, the concentration of TBM increased when the free chlorine concentrations increased, implying the formation potential of harmful TBM in chlorinated seawater swimming pools.",

Nowadays, stimuli-responsive self-propelled nanomotors are appealing therapeutic agents for antibacterial therapy in vivo. However, achieving water disinfection using these nanobots is still a great challenge. Herein, we report on prebiotic galactooligosaccharide-based nanomotors for sunlight-regulated water disinfection. The nanomotors can utilize galactooligosaccharide-based N-nitrosamines as sunlight-responsive fuels for the spontaneous production of antibacterial nitric oxide. Such a solar-to-chemical energy conversion would power the nanomotors for self-diffusiophoresis, which could promote the diffusion of the nanomotors in water and their penetration in the biofilm, significantly enhancing the inhibition and elimination of the pathogens and their biofilms in aquatic environments. After water treatments, the prebiotic-based residual disinfectants can be selectively utilized by beneficial bacteria to effectively relieve safety risks to the environment and human health. The low-energy-cost, green and potent antibacterial nanobots show promising potential in water disinfection.",

Given the pervasive nature of PI residues and solar exposure during application, the role of solar light in remediating the challenging highly saline water matrices needs to be elucidated. In this study, bisphenol A (BPA) was selected as the targeted micropollutant, which can be efficiently eliminated by the simulated sunlight (SSL)/PI system in the presence of high-level Cl- (up to 846.0 mM) at pH 7.0. The presence of different background constituents of water, such as halides, nitrate, and dissolved organic matter, had no effect, or even accelerated BPA abatement. Particularly, the ubiquitous Br- or I- appreciably enhanced the BPA transformation efficiency, which may be ascribed to the generation of high-selective reactive HOBr or HOI. The in silico predictions suggested that the transformation products generated by halide-mediated SSL/PI systems via halogen substitutions showed greater persistence, bioaccumulation, and aquatic toxicity than BPA itself. These findings highlighted a widespread phenomenon during PI-based oxidative treatment of highly saline water, which needs special attention under solar light illumination.",

The single-phase cubic structure of CeO2 NPs was confirmed by Rietveld refined XRD, HRTEM, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The average crystallite size was calculated using Debye Scherrer formula and found to increase from 20 to 25 nm for CeO2 to GO-15/CeO2 samples, respectively. The related functional groups were observed from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, consistent with the outcomes of Raman spectroscopy. The optical band gap of each sample was calculated by using a Tauc plot, which was observed to decrease from 2.8 to 1.68 eV. The valence state of Ce (Ce3+ and Ce4+) was verified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for CeO2 and GO-10/CeO2. The poisonous methylene blue (MB) dye was used to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of each sample in direct sunlight. The GO-15/CeO2 nanocomposite showed the highest photocatalytic activity with rate constant (0.01633 min-1), and it degraded the MB dye molecules by 100% within 120 min. The high photocatalytic activity of this material for degrading MB dye establishes it as an outstanding candidate for wastewater treatment. Further, these nanocomposites also demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1."

      "abstract": "Textile wastewater laden with dyes has emerged as a source of water pollution. This possesses a challenge in its effective treatment using a single functional material. In respond to this technological constraint, this work presents multifunctional cotton fabrics (CFs) within a single, streamlined preparation process. This approach utilizes the adherence of Ag NPs (nanoparticles) using Si binder on the surface of CFs, resulting in Ag-coated CFs through a pad dry method. The prepared samples were characterized using scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray electroscopy (SEM-EDS), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR). It was found that the FT-IR spectra of Ag NPs-coated CFs had peaks appear at 3400, 2900, and 1200 cm-1, implying the stretching vibrations of O-H, C-H, and C-O, respectively. Based on the EDX analysis, the presence of C, O, and Ag related to the coated CFs were detected. After coating the CFs with varying concentrations of Ag NPs (1%, 2% and 3% (w/w)), they were used to remove dyes. Under the same concentration of 10 mg/L and optimized pH 7.5 and 2 h of reaction time, 3% (w/w) Ag-coated CFs exhibited a substantial MB degradation of 98 %, while removing 95% of methyl orange, 85% of rhodamine B, and 96% of Congo red, respectively, following 2 h of Vis exposure. Ag NPs had a strong absorption at 420 nm with 2.51 eV of energy band gap. Under UV irradiation, electrons excited and produced free radicals that promoted dyes photodegradation. The oxidation by-products included p-dihydroxybenzene and succinic acid. Spent Ag-coated CFs attained 98% of regeneration efficiency. The utilization of Ag-coated CFs as a photocatalyst facilitated treated effluents to meet the required discharge standard of lower than 1 mg/L mandated by national legislation. The integration of multifunctional CFs in the treatment system presents a new option for tackling water pollution due to dyes.",

Here, we report a strategy of preparation of a sunlight-driven rechargeable antibacterial textiles based on natural antibacterial agents, which can work in light and dark conditions. The prepared BD-PTL@wool has long-lasting antibacterial properties, can rapidly produce ROS, and can store sterilization activity under light irradiation, ensuring all-day bacterial killing (>99.95 % under light irradiation and >99.80 % under dark conditions after light irradiation). BD-PTL@wool has excellent reusability, and the antibacterial rate can still above 95 % after repeated use for 5 times. In addition, BD-PTL@wool has excellent hydrophilic, UV resistance, biocompatibility and can withstand 50 washing cycles. The successful application of this strategy in textile preparation broadens the research idea for exploring the application of green photosensitive antibacterial materials in textile field.",

The role of vitamin D in susceptibility to and as an adjunctive treatment for TB is being studied extensively, although no study has included MDR-TB patients in context to dietary profile with vitamin D levels and sunlight exposure.Objective: This study aimed to estimate vitamin D serum levels and examine their association with dietary intake of vitamin D and sun exposure in patients with MDR-TB.Methods: North Indian participants were enrolled in three groups: MDR-TB, drug-susceptible pulmonary TB (DS-PTB), and healthy controls. All consenting participants underwent the estimation of macro- and micronutrient intake and sunlight exposure using structured questionnaires. Serum biochemistry, including 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium levels, was measured, and the correlation between variables was determined.Results: 747 participants were enrolled. Significant differences among the three groups were found in mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, body mass index, macronutrient intake, dietary vitamin D and calcium content, and sun exposure index (SEI). All except sun exposure (SEI was highest in DS-PTB patients) were found to follow the trend: MDR-TB < DS-PTB < healthy controls. The mean serum vitamin D levels of all groups were deficient and correlated positively with dietary intake and SEI.Conclusion: In this study's we found significant association of serum vitamin D concentrations, dietary intake and sunlight exposure in MDR-TB, DS-PTB patients and healthy controls. Dietary intake may be more important than sun exposure in determining serum levels. However, the significance of this finding is uncertain. Further studies are required to confirm the association, direction, and potential for vitamin D supplementation to treat or prevent MDR-TB infection.",

Inactivation by sunlight/H2O2 treatment decreased as MPs concentration and H2O2 dose were increased. Noteworthy, an opposite behaviour was observed for SPF process where inactivation increased as MPs concentration was increased. Biofilm formation and microbial attachment on surfaces of post-treated MPs were observed on polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs by field emission scanning electron microscopy. In presence of PE MPs, a complete inactivation of E. Coli was achieved by SPF with EDDS (Fe:EDDS = 1:2) after 90 min treatment unlike of sunlight/H2O2 treatment (∼4.0 log reduction, 40 mg/L H2O2 dose, 90 min treatment). The lower efficiency of sunlight/H2O2 process could be attributed to the blocking/scattering effect of MPs on sunlight, which finally reduced the intracellular photo Fenton effect. A reduced E. coli regrowth was observed in presence of MPs. SPF (Fe:EDDS = 1:1) with PE MPs was less effective in controlling bacterial regrowth (∼120 CFU/100 mL) than sunlight/H2O2 (∼10 CFU/100 mL) after 48 h of post-treatment. These results provide useful information about possible interference of MPs on urban wastewater disinfection by solar driven AOPs and possible implications for effluent reuse.",

Multiple advanced techniques, such as XPS, XRD, TEM, XRF, and UV-vis spectrophotometry, were used to characterize and confirm the successful preparation of UIO-66 impregnated with MoS2QDs. The results indicated that the best heterostructure catalyst exhibited superior efficiency in the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) in water, achieving approximately 99% removal within 30 minutes under simulated sunlight, while approximately 97% removal under visible light. The outstanding photocatalytic performance is predominantly attributed to the photoinduced separation of carriers in this heterostructure system. This study proposes a unique, simple, and low-cost method for improving the degradation performance of organic contaminants in water."

A significant challenge in implementing a practical and viable approach is the utilization of solar energy-an abundant, natural, and cost-effective resource-for photochemical processes within advanced oxidation processes. In this study, we explored the use of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) as photocatalyst prepared via an environmentally friendly synthesis approach, resulting in the formation of crystalline wurtzite nanoparticles, with an average size of about 14 nm relatively spherical in shape. Notably, the extract derived from Moringa oleifera was employed in this investigation. These nanoparticles were characterized and validated using various characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. For comparison, conventionally synthesized ZnO NPs were also included in the evaluations. The findings reveal that, under illumination, biosynthesized ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit photocatalytic performance in effectively breaking down the organic compounds present in synthetic petroleum wastewater. Photochemical analysis further illustrates the degradation efficiency of Green-ZnO, which, within 180 min of irradiation resulted in 51%, 52%, 88%, and 93% of removal for Phenol, O-Cresol. Under optimal loading conditions, NPs produced via the green synthesis approach perform better when compared to chemically synthesized ZnO. This significant improvement in photocatalytic activity underscores the potential of eco-friendly synthesis methods in achieving enhanced water treatment efficiency."

The purpose of the current work is to elucidate and validate the application of a promising g-C3N4/GO/SnFe2O4 (CGS) composite for the environmental remediation of methylene blue dye. The ternary CGS composite has been synthesized using a solvothermal approach. The fabricated composites were analyzed through FTIR, XRD, SEM/EDX, UV-VIS spectroscopy, TEM, and XPS. The photoactivity of composites and affecting parameters (pH, H2O2 dosage, composite amount, initial dye concentration, and irradiation time) were observed in sunlight illumination. The optimal conditions for photocatalytic degradation were pH = 5, photocatalyst dosage = 30 mg/100 mL, H2O2 dosage = 6 mM, and initial dye concentration (IDC) of 10 ppm employing ternary CGS composite, and MB dye was degraded effectively within 1 h. Ninety-eight percent degradation efficacy was attained by employing ternary CGS composite under the optimized conditions. Scavenging analysis suggested that •OH radicals were the key reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for the photodegradation of MB dye. Furthermore, the CGS nanocomposite exhibited outstanding recyclability of 84% after five consecutive runs, demonstrating its potential for use in practical applications, particularly pollutant removal.",

EPP has significant impacts on health-related quality of life, though there is variable disease severity. Accurately capturing how much time individuals with EPP can spend outdoors before they develop symptoms is critical to understanding HRQoL and measuring therapeutic response. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop a comprehensive and content valid sun exposure diary to assess the efficacy of new therapies in individuals with EPP. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with adult and adolescent EPP participants, as well as five clinical experts, to obtain their input on the content of an existing sun exposure diary. Revisions to the diary were made based on evidence generated in cognitive debriefing interviews analyzed in eight consecutive groups of EPP participant. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 17 adults and 6 adolescents with EPP. The average age of adults was 40 years and of adolescents was 14 years. Clinical experts thought the original diary needed clarification on the description of symptoms, how time outdoors was captured, and the distinction between direct vs. indirect sunlight. Participants with EPP also noted these items needed revision, and that the distinction between prodromal symptoms and full reaction symptoms should be clarified. In the final diary version, participants with EPP found most items to be clear and easy to complete/think about. Seventy-six percent of participants (13/17) asked thought the diary was easy to complete. The remainder thought the majority of the diary was easy to complete with the exception of select questions. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating a new treatment for EPP requires accurately capturing time in sunlight and symptoms in this unique disorder. The newly developed sun exposure diary is content valid and can be used to assess important aspects of symptoms and daily life and therefore evaluate clinically meaningful therapeutic response.",

      "abstract": "It remains as a challenge for realizing efficient photo-responsive catalysts towards large-scale degradation of organic pollutants under natural sunlight. This work reports a new pore engineering strategy for creating ultra-porous g-C3N4 micro-tubes with an unprecedentedly high specific surface area of 152.96 m2/g. This is mainly associated with releasing internal vapor pressure in the autoclave where the hydrothermal treatment of the urea/melamine mixture is processed. Supported by microscopic observation, porosity measurement and spectroscopic characterization, it is found that releasing the pressure at halfway of hydrothermal process is vital for forming exfoliated rod-like precursors and the de-aggregation of these rods presents substantial benefits on the production of mesopores on g-C3N4 micro-tubes during the calcination of precursors. This offers a large number of reactive sites required by photocatalytic reaction. Coupling these micro-tubes with Ti3C2TX nanosheets via electrostatic interaction yields a 1D/2D heterojunction with a close interfacial contact. The addition of metallically conductive Ti3C2TX nanosheets accelerates the separation between electrons and holes, and also enhances the light absorption. All these merits of structural design lead to forming a group of highly efficient catalysts demonstrating an excellent photocatalytic degradation rate of k = 0.0560 min-1 for RhB dyes under 100 mW/cm2 visible light radiation that micks sunlight outdoors. This laboratory valuation is further supported by an outdoor test that shows a fast degradation rate of 0.0744 min-1 under natural sunlight.",

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis demonstrated that the prepared NPs are effectively crystallized in the polycrystalline single-phase monoclinic geometry of Ag2S. The optical bandgap is significantly reduced, and for both the sample the average grain size is observed to have narrowed from 42 nm to 23 nm. Both NPs were confirmed to be spherical nature as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis validated the presence of all necessary components at the expected concentrations in the obtained samples. Under the irradiation of sunshine, the photocatalytic properties of each sample were investigated for their ability to facilitate the photodegradation of a hazardous methylene blue (MB) dye in an aqueous solution. Cu/Ag2S sample possesses a profound photocatalytic reaction for the destruction of MB dye. Furthermore, the Cu-doped Ag2S NPs suppress the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In comparison to pure Ag2S NPs, Cu/Ag2S showed enhanced antibacterial activity against both the bacteria. Current study suggests that the Cu doped Ag2S NPs could be a promising material for wastewater treatment and antimicrobial agents."

Post-treatment, all the physicochemical parameters such as DO, BOD, COD, Nitrates, Ammonia and Phenolic contents were found to be reduced to 10 times bringing Yamuna water parameters within safe limits. Our TZ NCs have shown to have high selectivity for the removal of Chromium from water. Out of all the three concentrations 0.2 g/500 mL or 0.4 mg/mL is the most optimum concentration of TZ NCs for complete Yamuna wastewater treatment. Also, the bacterial culture present in Yamuna water was killed by 90% using TZ having MIC of 0.1 mg/mL. The antibiofilm activity of TZ against K.pneumoniae MTCC 109 was also checked using Congo Red Agar Assay. The presence of heavy metals, their corresponding degradation and leaching studies were analysed using ICP-OES. TZ NCs showed a very minimal leaching rate of Zinc into the water, proving no toxicity associated with these nanocomposites. Further, to observe the safe disposal of TZ NCs into the soil, TZ NCs were utilised for ecotoxicity studies.",

The application of the developed photocatalytic beads, named CB-Cat, was directed at a simultaneous adsorption/photocatalysis process, which was carried out under simulated sunlight. The characterization of the CB-Cat indicated a good dispersion of the photocatalyst of choice throughout the cellulose matrix, confirming its incorporation into the cellulose beads. Furthermore, it is possible to observe the presence of the photocatalyst on the surface of the CB-Cat, confirming its availability for the photonic activation process. The results showed that the simultaneous adsorption/photocatalysis process was optimal for enhancing the efficiency of methylene blue (MB) removal, especially when compared to the isolated adsorption process. Additionally, the regeneration of the CB-Cat between cycles was favorable toward the maintenance of the MB removal efficiency, as the process carried out without regeneration displayed significant efficiency drops between cycles. Finally, the mechanism evaluation evidenced that hydroxyl and superoxide radicals were the main responsible for the MB photocatalytic degradation during illumination with simulated sunlight.",

Herein, by modifying a small amount of sulphide on the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), a ZnS@ZIF-8 composite and used for photocatalytic H2O2 production to degrade chlorinated organic pollutants under simulated sunlight (SSL). ZnS@ZIF-8 composite could enhance the separation of photo-induced charge carriers, promote electron transfer from zinc sulphide (ZnS) to ZIF-8, which exhibited good selectivity for the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e--ORR) and two-electron water oxidation (2e--WOR) pathways. Based on oxygen (O2) activation, the developed ZnS@ZIF-8/O2/SSL system could achieve 6.43 mmol/L H2O2 production within 150 min, which was approximately 8.66 and 10.36 times higher than that of the ZnS/O2/SSL and ZIF-8/O2/SSL systems, respectively. In the ZnS@ZIF-8/O2/SSL system, the ORR, WOR and H2O2 photolysis led to the generation of hydroxyl radical (•OH), while the photochemical behavior of ZnS in ZnS@ZIF-8 composite resulted in the generation of active hydrogen (*H). Benefitting from the high concentration of H2O2 and the coexistence of redox species in the ZnS@ZIF-8/O2/SSL system, various chlorinated organic pollutants could be dechlorinated and mineralized. In addition, a possible mechanism for photocatalytic H2O2 production was also proposed. Importantly, the proposed process did not involve an additional sacrificial agent or Fenton-like catalysts. This work provides insights into the potential application of ZnS@ZIF-8 composite for H2O2 production and wastewater treatment."

The current study examined the generated CuO NPs and their physical qualities by using ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectroscopy. The distinctive peak at 265 nm of the CuO NP production was originally seen. Additionally, an X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigation was conducted to identify the crystalline arrangement of the produced CuO NPs, and a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy examination was performed to validate the functional compounds of the CuO NPs. Additionally, the synthesized nanoparticles' catalytic activities (wastewater treatment) were analyzed in dark and sunlight modes. The catalytic properties of CuO NPs in total darkness resulted in 64.21% discoloration, whereas exposure to sunshine increased the nanomaterials' catalyst performance to 92.31%. By lowering Cr(VI), Ni, Pb, Co, and Cd in sewage by proportions of 91.4, 80.8, 68.26, 73.25, and 72.4% accordingly, the CuO NP demonstrated its effectiveness as a nanosorbent.

      "abstract": "Membrane aerated biofilm reactors (MABRs) can be used to treat domestic wastewater containing sulfamethoxazole (SMX) because of their favorable performance in the treatment of refractory pollutants. However, biologics are generally subjected to antibiotics stress, which induces the production of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, a simulated-sunlight assisted MABR (L-MABR) was used to promote SMX removal and reduce ARGs production. The SMX removal efficiency of the l-MABR system was 9.62 % superior to that of the MABR system (83.13 %). In contrast from MABR, in the l-MABR, only 28.75 % of SMX was removed through microbial activity because functional bacteria were inactivated through radiation by simulated sunlight. In addition, photolysis (64.61 %) dominated SMX removal, and the best performing indirect photolysis process was the excited state of effluent organic matters (3EfOMs*). Through photolysis, ultraviolet (UV) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) enriched the SMX removal route, resulting in the SMX removal pathway in the l-MABR no longer being limited by enzyme catalysis. More importantly, because of the inactivation of functional bacteria, whether in the effluent or biofilm, the copy number of ARGs in the l-MABR was 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than that in the MABR. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing simulated-sunlight to enhance the antibiotic removal efficiency while reducing ARG production, thus providing a novel idea for the removal of antibiotics from wastewater.",

The polluted water from various industries contains refractory organic materials such as dyes. Heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductor metal oxides is an effective remediation technique for wastewater treatment. In this research, we used a co-precipitation-assisted hydrothermal method to synthesize a novel I-FeWO4/GO sunlight-active nanocomposite. Introducing dopant reductive iodine species improved the catalytic activity of FeWO4/GO. I- ions improved the catalytic performance of H2O2 by doping into FeWO4/GO composite. Due to I- doping and the introduction of graphene as a support medium, enhanced charge separation and transfer were observed, which is crucial for efficient heterogeneous surface reactions. Various techniques, like FTIR, SEM-EDX, XRD, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, were used to characterize composites. The Tauc plot method was used to calculate pristine and iodine-doped FeWO4/GO bandgap. Iodine doping reduced the bandgap from 2.8 eV to 2.6 eV. The degradation of methylene blue (MB) was evaluated by optimizing various parameters like catalyst concentration, oxidant dose, pH, and time. The optimum conditions for photocatalysts where maximum degradation occurred were pH = 7 for both FeWO4/GO and I-FeWO4/GO; oxidant dose = 9 mM and 7 mM for FeWO4/GO and I-FeWO4/GO; and catalyst concentration = 30 mg and 35 mg/100 mL for FeWO4/GO and I-FeWO4/GO; the optimum time was 120 min. Under these optimum conditions, FeWO4/GO and I-FeWO4/GO showed 92.0% and 97.0% degradation of MB dye."

Acetylacetone (AcAc) has been reported a specific algicide to inactivate Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) and an effective light activator to degrade pollutants. This study systematically investigated the photodegradation ability of AcAc under xenon (Xe) irradiation on the secondary metabolites of M. aeruginosa, mainly algal organic matter (AOM), especially toxic microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Results showed that AcAc outperformed H2O2 in destructing the protein-like substances, humic acid-like matters, aromatic proteins and fulvic-like substances of AOM. For MC-LR (250 µg/L), 0.05 mmol/L AcAc attained the same degradation efficiency (87.0%) as 0.1 mmol/L H2O2. The degradation mechanism of Xe/AcAc might involve photo-induced energy/electron transfer and formation of carbon center radicals. Alkaline conditions (pH > 9.0) were detrimental to the photoactivity of AcAc, corresponding to the observed degradation rate constant (k1 value) of MC-LR drastically decreasing to 0.0013 min-1 as solution pH exceeded 9.0. The PO43- and HCO3- ions had obvious inhibition effects, whereas NO3- slightly improved k1 value from 0.0277 min-1 to 0.0321 min-1. The presence of AOM did not significantly inhibit MC-LR degradation in Xe/AcAc system. In addition, the biological toxicity of MC-LR was greatly reduced after photoreaction. These results demonstrated that AcAc was an alternative algicidal agent to effectively inactivate algal cells and simultaneously control the secondary metabolites after cell lysis. Nevertheless, the concentration and irradiation conditions should be further optimized in practical application.",

      "abstract": "Insights into COVID-19 antivirals' environmental fate and ecological risk are urgently required due to their increasing concentrations in aquatic environments, which have rarely been studied. Herein, we first investigated the photochemical transformation and the resulting alterations in toxicity of arbidol, an antiviral drug with relatively higher toxicity. The photolysis of arbidol was rapid with a rate constant of 0.106 min-1 due to its superior ultraviolet light absorption, in which the direct photolysis was predominated with a contribution of 91.5%. Despite its substantial photolysis, only 14.45% of arbidol was mineralized after 100 min, implying that arbidol and its products might have a long-term impact on aquatic environment. It was inferred that arbidol was photolyzed mainly via the loss of thiophenol, bromine, and alkylamine, based on twelve photolytic products identified. Notably, the experimental results demonstrated that the photolysis process increased the acute toxicity of arbidol, and the toxicity prediction indicated that the ecotoxicity of two photolytic products was very high with LC50 values below 0.1 mg/L. Due to the co-effect of multiple constituents, the photolytic rate observed in wastewater treatment plant effluent and in river water was comparable to that in ultra-pure water, while it was slightly enhanced in lake water. The presence of dissolved organic matter suppressed arbidol photolysis, while NO3- exhibited a promotion effect. These results would be of great significance to assess the fate and risk of COVID-19 antivirals in natural aquatic environments.",

Many regions of the world lack centralized wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure, which presents additional considerations for wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, including environmental decay of the RT-qPCR gene targets used for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 virions. Given the role of sunlight in the environmental decay of RNA, we evaluated sunlight photolysis kinetics of the N1 gene target in heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 with a solar simulator under laboratory conditions. Insignificant photolysis of the N1 target was observed in a photosensitizer-free matrix. Conversely, significant decay of the N1 target was observed in wastewater at a shallow depth (<1 cm). Given that sunlight irradiance is affected by several environmental factors, first-order decay rate models were used to evaluate the effect of water column depth, time of the year, and latitude on decay kinetics. Decay rate constants were found to decrease significantly with greater depth of the well-mixed water column, at high latitudes, and in the winter. Therefore, sunlight-mediated decay of the N1 gene target is likely to be minimal, and is unlikely to confound results from wastewater-based epidemiology programs utilizing wastewater-impacted surface waters.",

      "abstract": "Considering the increasing amount of water pollution, nanocomposite advances for the effective elimination of hazardous pollutants are still needed. α-Fe2O3, Cr0·5Fe1·5O3 and CrFeO3 nanoparticles were synthesized via an eco-friendly material synthesis i. e hydrothermal route without using any precipitating agent and were studied to remove congo-red dye using photocatalytic properties. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FESEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations have been performed to know about the material structure and properties of synthesized samples. High efficiency (95.2%) of degradation was achieved under sunlight using a very low amount of CrFeO3 catalyst (0.2 g/L) at a 6-pH level of dye and was confirmed using UV spectroscopy, TOC (84%), LC-HRMS. Also, the potential to degrade the CR dye was concluded from the high rate of BOD5/COD. The results showed a significant enhancement in the degradation of α-Fe2O3 from 52.3% to 95.2% in a short duration of 15 min by introducing chromium as a dopant. The doping of chromium influenced the major factors responsible for the photocatalytic activity such as the increase in range of absorbance, increased e--h+ pair separation, improvement in the charge transfer process and active site formation which significantly enhanced the process of degradation. We found that the Cr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanomaterial could effectively remove dyes, such as congo-red, from industrial water-waste."

      "abstract": "The emerging global problem of antimicrobial resistance needs immediate attention. In this regard, this work demonstrates the use of expanded polystyrene waste in the synthesis of immobilized photocatalytic films for the treatment of antibiotics as well as for bacterial disinfection. A boron-cerium codoped TiO2 catalyst (of specific composition: B0.8Ce0.2TiO2) was immobilized in an expanded polystyrene (EPS) film prepared from waste EPS beads. These films were studied for the degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and disinfection of E. coli under sunlight. The film with a catalyst loading of 20 wt% showed a maximum degradation of 89% in 240 min with a corresponding TOC reduction of 84%. A 7.4 and 6.3 log reduction from the bacterial inactivation studies in the presence and absence of antibiotics, respectively, was obtained. The EPS film was stable after five times of reuse, and no significant chemical changes in the used film were observed from FTIR analysis. The average thickness of the prepared film was found from FESEM analysis to be 1.09 mm. These EPS films were also tested for degradation of other antibiotics, such as norfloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The EPS films were tested in two different reactor volumes at optimum conditions. Also, the effectiveness of B0.8Ce0.2TiO2/EPS film in real water samples indicates its potential in large-scale and real-world applications. Thus, these B0.8Ce0.2TiO2/EPS films can be effectively employed for both degradation of ciprofloxacin and the disinfection of E. coli under solar light to solve the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance.",

      "abstract": "We have used an environmentally friendly approach to produce zinc oxide nanoparticles from an aqueous extract of Cucumis maderaspatanus L. leaves (Cm-ZnO NPs). Leaf extract phytoconstituents work as both reducing and stabilising agents. Calcination at 300, 500, 700, and 800 °C allowed fine-tuning of the bandgap of synthesised Cm-ZnO NPs, which has been well-characterized. The XRD analysis confirmed the crystalline nature of the Cm-ZnO NPs. The Cm-ZnO NPs were found to be spherical and averaged 8.6 nm in size, as determined by transmission electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. TGA testing validated the nanoparticles' resilience to heat. The zeta potential measurements showed that the Cm-ZnO NPs were stable. By analysing the sorption of nitrogen onto the nanoparticles, we were able to calculate their surface area, which came in at 19 m2/g. The degradation of orange G (OG) dye in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) served as an oxidizing agent and measured the photocatalytic efficiency of the Cm-ZnO NPs. In addition, the effect of varying dye, H2O2, and catalyst concentrations on photodegradation was studied. The rate of reactions was computed. In conclusion, the obtained data demonstrated that the produced Cm-ZnO NPs can be employed as a cost-efficient catalyst for textile industrial effluent treatment."

On one side, the harmful effluents from detergents are endangering marine biota, while on the other end, microplastics are observed even in breastfeeding milk. This work proposes the development of sunlight-driven cleaning and antibacterial comfort fabrics by immobilizing functionalized Zn-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. The research was implemented to limit the use of various detergents and chemicals for stain removal. A facile sol-gel method has opted for the fabrication of pristine and Zn-doped TiO2 nanoparticles at three different mole percentages of Zn. The nanoparticles were successfully functionalized and immobilized on cotton fabric using silane coupling agents via pad-dry-cure treatment. As-obtained fabrics were characterized by their surface morphologies, availability of chemical functionalities, and crystallinity. The sunlight-assisted degradation potential of as-functionalized fabrics was evaluated against selected pollutants (eight commercial dyes). The 95-98% degradation of dyes from the functionalized fabric surface was achieved within 3 h of sunlight exposure, estimated by color strength analysis with an equivalent exposition of bactericidal activities. The treated fabrics also preserved their comfort and mechanical properties. The radical trapping experiment was performed to confirm the key radicals responsible for dye degradation, and h+ ions were found to be the most influencing species. The reaction pathway followed the first order kinetic model with rate constant values of 0.0087 min-1 and 0.0131 min-1 for MB and MO dyes, respectively."

      "abstract": "Triclosan is considered as recalcitrant contaminant difficult to degrade from the contaminated wastewater. Thus, promising, and sustainable treatment method is necessary to remove triclosan from the wastewater. Intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation (ICPB) is an emerging, low-cost, efficient, and eco-friendly method for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants. In this study BiOI photocatalyst coated bacterial biofilm developed at carbon felt for efficient degradation and mineralization of triclosan was studied. Based on the characterization of BiOI prepared using methanol had lower band gap 1.85 eV which favors lower recombination of electron-hole pair and higher charge separation which ascribed to enhanced photocatalytic activity. ICPB exhibits 89% of triclosan degradation under direct sunlight exposure. The results showed that production of reactive oxygen species hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical anion played crucial role in the degradation of triclosan into biodegradable metabolites further the bacterial communities mineralized the biodegradable metabolites into water and carbon dioxide. The confocal laser scanning electron microscope results emphasized that interior of the biocarrier shows a large number of live bacterial cells existing in the photocatalyst-coated carrier, where the little toxic effect on bacterial biofilm occurred on the exterior of the carrier. The extracellular polymeric substances characterization result remarkable confirms that which could act as sacrificial agent of photoholes further helped by preventing the toxicity to the bacterial biofilm from the reactive oxygen species and triclosan. Hence, this promising approach can be a possible alternative method for the wastewater treatment polluted with triclosan.",

      "abstract": "Chloroquine phosphate (CQ) is an antiviral drug for Coronavirus Disease 2019 and an old drug for treatment of malaria, which has been detected in natural waters. Despite its prevalence, the environmental fate of CQ remains unclear. In this study, the direct photodegradation of CQ under simulated sunlight was investigated. The effect of various parameters such as pH, initial concentration and environmental matrix were examined. The photodegradation quantum yield of CQ (4.5 × 10-5-0.025) increased with the increasing pH value in the range of 6.0-10.0. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry and quenching experiments verified that the direct photodegradation of CQ was primarily associated with excited triplet states of CQ (3CQ*). The common ions had negligible effect and humic substances exhibited a negative effect on CQ photodegradation. The photoproducts were identified using high-resolution mass spectrometry and the photodegradation pathway of CQ was proposed. The direct photodegradation of CQ involved the cleavage of the C-Cl bond and substitution of the hydroxyl group, followed by further oxidation to yield carboxylic products. The photodegradation processes were further confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) computation for the energy barrier of CQ dichlorination. The findings contribute to the assessment of the ecological risk associated with the overuse of Coronavirus drugs during global public health emergencies.",

The phase composition, morphology, size, and chemical elements of the FSCN were studied using XRD, SEM, XPS, and UV-visible spectrophotometry. Under simulated sunlight, the removal rate for 40 mg·L-1 tetracycline (TC) by FSCN reached 76%, which was 1.2 times that of powder g-C3N4. Under natural sunlight illumination, the TC removal rate of FSCN was 70.4%, which was only 5.6% lower than that of a xenon lamp. In addition, after three repeated uses, the removal rates of the FSCN and powder g-C3N4 samples decreased by 1.7% and 2.9%, respectively, indicating that FSCN had better stability and reusability. The excellent photocatalytic activity of FSCN benefits from its three-dimensional-network sponge-like structure and outstanding light absorption properties. Finally, a possible degradation mechanism for the FSCN photocatalyst was proposed. This photocatalyst can be used as a floating catalyst for the treatment of antibiotics and other types of water pollution, providing ideas for the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants in practical applications.",

Photo-oxidation is an appealing treatment option and alternative to conventional flocculation and microbial antagonists, but the performances of current photosensitizers (either inorganic or organic) are unsatisfactory. Here, a polythiophene photosensitizer (PT10) with both high yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (mainly 1O2, ΦΔ = 0.51, > 8 h continuous generation) and moderate photostability was used as a powerful algaecide to inhibit Microcystis aeruginosa. Due to the positive charge of PT10, the algal cells were quickly flocculated, followed by efficient inactivation in 4 h under white light irradiation (96.7%, 10 mW/cm2). Meanwhile, PT10 was self-immolated in about 6 h. Upon biosafety evaluation with adult zebrafish, the low toxicity of PT10 and the degradation products of PT10 and algae (early logarithmic growth stage) were confirmed. In addition, microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a toxic microcystin that will be released during the destruction of the algal cells, was also degraded. Therefore, PT10-based photoinactivation of M. aeruginosa featured both high performance and low secondary pollution. In real-world aquatic systems, PT10 was confirmed to be capable of sunlight-assisted inactivation of M. aeruginosa and prevent algal blooms, thus making it appealing for environmental remediation.",

However, little is known about the reactivation of sunlight-inactivated ARB in natural waters. In this study, the reactivation of sunlight-inactivated ARB in dark conditions was investigated with tetracycline-resistant E. coli (Tc-AR E. coli) as a representative. Results showed that sunlight-inactivated Tc-AR E. coli underwent dark repair to regain tetracycline resistance with dark repair ratios increasing from (0.124 ± 0.012)‱ within 24 h dark treatment to (0.891 ± 0.033)‱ within 48 h. The presence of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) promoted the reactivation of sunlight-inactivated Tc-AR E. coli and tetracycline inhibited their reactivation. The reactivation of sunlight-inactivated Tc-AR E. coli is mainly attributed to the repair of the tetracycline-specific efflux pump in the cell membrane. Tc-AR E. coli in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state was observed and dominated the reactivation as the inactivated ARB remain present in the dark for more than 20 h. These results explained the reason for distribution difference of Tc-ARB at different depths in natural waters, which are of great significance for understanding the environmental behavior of ARB.",

      "abstract": "Natural sunlight can reduce the chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) and biological effects from the discharged domestic wastewater. But the aquatic photolysis and biotoxic variations of specific CECs detected in secondary effluent (SE) were not clear. In this study, 29 CECs were detected in the SE, and 13 medium- and high-risk CECs were identified as target chemicals based on their ecological risk assessment. To comprehensively explore the photolysis properties of the identified target chemicals, the direct and self-sensitized photodegradation of the target chemicals, even the indirect photodegradation in the mixture, were investigated and compared with these photodegradation in the SE. Of the 13 target chemicals, only five chemicals (including dichlorvos (DDVP), mefenamic acid (MEF), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (DPH), chlorpyrifos (CPF), and imidacloprid (IMI)) underwent direct and self-sensitized photodegradation processes. The removal of DDVP, MEF, and DPH was attributed to self-sensitized photodegradation, which was mainly mediated by •OH; CPF and IMI primarily relied on direct photodegradation. Synergistic and/or antagonistic actions that occurred in the mixture improved/decreased the rate constants of five photodegradable target chemicals. Meanwhile, the biotoxicities (acute toxicity and genotoxicity) of the target chemicals (including individual chemicals and the mixture) were significantly reduced, which can explain the reduction of biotoxicities from SE. For the two refractory high-risk chemicals, atrazine (ATZ) and carbendazim (MBC), algae-derived intracellular dissolved organic matter (IOM) on ATZ, and IOM and extracellular dissolved organic matter (EOM) on MBC had slightly promotion for their photodegradation; while peroxysulfate, and peroxymonosulfate served as sensitizers were activated by natural sunlight and effectively improved their photodegradation rate, and then reduced their biotoxicities. These findings will promote the development of CECs treatment technologies based on sunlight irradiation.",

However, remediation of PAH-contaminated soils through photocatalytic technology remains a challenge. Therefore, the photocatalyst g-C3N4/α-Fe2O3 was synthesized and applied to photocatalytic degradation of fluoranthene in soil. The physicochemical properties of g-C3N4/α-Fe2O3 and various degradation parameters, such as catalyst dosage, the ratio of water/soil, and initial pH, were investigated in detail. In soil slurry reaction system (water/soil=10:1, w/w), the optimal degradation efficiency on fluoranthene was 88.7% after simulated sunlight irradiation for 12 h (contaminated soil=2 g, initial fluoranthene concentration=36 mg/kg, catalyst dosage=5%, and pH=6.8), and the photocatalytic degradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The degradation efficiency of g-C3N4/α-Fe2O3 was higher compared with P25. Degradation mechanism analysis showed that •O2- and h+ are the main active species in photocatalytic degradation process of fluoranthene by g-C3N4/α-Fe2O3. Coupling g-C3N4 and α-Fe2O3 enhances the interfacial charge transport capacity via Z-scheme charge transfer route and inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes of g-C3N4 and α-Fe2O3, then significantly improves the production of active species and photocatalytic activity. Results showed that photocatalytic treatment of soil by g-C3N4/α-Fe2O3 is an effective strategy for remediation of soils contaminated by PAHs.",

To treat it efficiently and ecologically, many studies have explored the antibacterial properties of two-dimensional nanomaterials in water, but their static antibacterial modes limit their effectiveness. In this work, we designed a facile and effective antibacterial nanorobots by loading super small gold nanorods (sAuNR) onto the surface of MXene nanosheets (MXene@sAuNR). The plasmon resonance effect of sAuNR can enhance the optical absorption cross section of the nanorobots, thereby improving their motion ability under irradiation and then causing cell membrane mechanical damage to bacteria. Our research proved that nanorobots with good optical driving characteristics displayed gratifying antibacterial properties even at ultra-low concentration as 5 µg/mL within 30 min. Furthermore, the nanorobots showed satisfactory antibacterial efficiency in real river samples under sunlight irradiation. These nanorobots presented in this study provides valuable insights towards designing self-energy collection and self-driving antibacterial materials that overcome the shortcomings of conventional static antibacterial methods. As sunlight is the cheapest and natural light source, these nanorobots have opened an effective and sustainable way for large-scale treatment of bacterial pollution in water.",

      "abstract": "In this work, Fe3+-iminodisuccinic acid (Fe:IDS) based solar photo Fenton (SPF), an Italian patented method, was investigated in quaternary treatment of real urban wastewater and compared to Fe3+-ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (Fe:EDDS) for the first time. Three pharmaceuticals (PCs) (sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine and trimethoprim) and four pathogens (Escherichia coli, somatic and F-plus coliphages, Clostridium perfringens, consistently with the new EU regulation for wastewater reuse (2020/741)), were chosen as target pollutants. SPF with Fe:EDDS was more effective in PCs removal (80%, 10 kJ L-1) than the SPF with Fe:IDS (58%), possibly due to the higher capability of generating hydroxyl radicals. On the contrary, Fe:IDS was more effective (4.3 log inactivation for E. coli) than Fe:EDDS (1.9 log) in pathogens inactivation, possibly due to a lower iron precipitation and turbidity which finally promoted an improved intracellular photo-Fenton mechanism. Fe:L based SPF was subsequently coupled to sunlight/H2O2. Interestingly, while its combination with Fe:EDDS based SPF slightly increased disinfectant efficacy (2.3 vs 1.9 log inactivation for E. coli), the combination with Fe:IDS decreased inactivation efficiency (3.4 vs 4.3 log reduction). In conclusion, due to the good compromise between PCs removal and disinfection efficiency, Fe:IDS SPF alone is an attractive option for quaternary treatment for urban wastewater reuse.",

Exposure of Fe3 O4 @D-wood with artificial sunlight showed an improved activity considering photochemical oxidation of organic pollutants in the presence of H2 O2 . The efficient generation of reactive radicals brought this system also to photopolymerization.

      "abstract": "Sunlight-induced photoirradiation of chlorine (sunlight/chlorine) can be observed in outdoor swimming pools and open-channel disinfection units for wastewater treatment. In this study, the degradation of ketamine, an environmentally persistent pharmaceutical, under sunlight irradiation in the presence of a low concentration of chlorine (1 mg/L as Cl2) was investigated to elucidate the evolution of reactive species and their contribution to ketamine removal. •OH dominates the initial stage of sunlight/chlorine; however, after chlorine depletion, reactions still progress with an observed rate constant (kobs = 7.6 ± 0.50 × 10-3 min-1) an order of magnitude higher than photolysis alone (kobs = 2.9 ± 0.15 × 10-4 min-1). When chlorine is depleted, O3 becomes the major reactant that degrades ketamine. High O3 yields were found in both sunlight/HOCl (12.5 ± 0.5% at pH 5) and sunlight/ClO- (10 ± 1% at pH 10) systems. At sub-µM levels, O3 resulted in substantial removal of ketamine, and even faster rates were observed in the presence of sunlight. A kinetic model was also established, and evaluate time-dependent concentration levels during sunlight/chlorine. The model simulation showed that the cumulative O3 concentration could reach 0.91 μM, and O3 contributed 31% ketamine removal during the sunlight/chlorine process. Primary and secondary amine functional groups were demonstrated to be the reaction sites of O3; other pharmaceuticals, such as atenolol and metoprolol, underwent similar phenomena. In addition, the experimental and model results further indicated that sunlight/ClO2- or ClO2 also participates in the degradation of ketamine with a minor role; trace amounts (below nM level) of ClO2- and ClO2 were estimated by the simulation.",

      "abstract": "Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) applied to wastewater treatment have become increasingly well developed and the ability of a single technology to remove difficult organic pollutants is limited. One of the main limiting factors is the insufficient variety and quantity of active species generated during the reaction process and catalyst failure. The coupling of the two methods is a practical and effective approach. In this study, different types of semiconductor persulfate (PS) activators, iron molybdate nanoparticles (I-FeMoO4, II-FeMoO4, and III-FeMoO4), were synthesized by simple solvothermal and calcination methods and applied to photo-assisted activation of PS systems. In addition, the relationship between the intrinsic physicochemical and optoelectronic properties of FeMoO4 and the catalytic degradation performance was revealed by a series of characterization tools, and the dominant catalysts were screened. At an unadjusted pH of 4.86, 0.6 g L-1 of PS and 0.4 g L-1 of I-FeMoO4 could achieve efficient degradation of several difficult organic dye contaminants (rhodamine b (Rh B), methylene blue (MB), malachite green (MG), methyl orange (MO), and tartrazine (TTZ)) and other antibiotic contaminants (sulfamethoxazole (SMX), tetracycline (TC), norfloxacin (NOR), and carbamazepine (CBZ)) within 5-60 min. Possible degradation mechanisms in the I-FeMoO4/PS/Light reaction system were suggested by radical trapping experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests. Recovery tests demonstrated that I-FeMoO4 has good recoverable stability and did not cause secondary pollution. Finally, our study provided a new perspective on the application of coupled wastewater treatment technologies in the practical treatment of organic wastewater.",

Although ADOM is known to be readily transformed by microbes, the role of sunlight-induced photochemical process and the interactions between two processes on ADOM transformation remains unclear. In this study, three types of treatments for ADOM, including photochemical process under natural solar light (L treatment), microbial process (M treatment), and the simultaneous photochemical plus microbial process (L&M), were performed for 18 days. Our results showed that M treatment was more effective for the loss of DOC, chromophoric DOM (CDOM) at short wavelengths (a254 and a280), than L treatment, while L treatment was more effective for the transformation of a350 and the fluorescent components of the ubiquitous humic-like component and the tryptophan-like component. Comparison in the decay kinetics of DOC and CDOM in the three treatments showed that the simultaneous photochemical and biological processes exhibited an inhibitory effect on DOC decay rate but not the percentage of labile DOC fraction. Higher relative abundance of protein-like substances was found after L&M treatment, while the relative abundance of humic-like substance and aromaticity increased after M treatment, and the low molecular-weight compounds were produced after L treatment. Our results emphasized the importance of photochemistry in processing ADOM to mediate the chemodiversity in natural water.",

      "abstract": "Here, we show that the adverse environmental and health effects of tetracycline (TC) can be efficiently reduced by encapsulating Ag3PO4 into MIL-101(Fe) to construct a Ag3PO4/MIL-101(Fe) heterojunction composite through advanced oxidation processes, such as Fenton catalysis, photocatalysis, and photo-Fenton catalysis. Notably, the reaction can be driven by natural sunlight and does not require any artificial energy source. Remarkably, the optimal degradation of TC can be achieved under different compositions of the composite system through photocatalysis and photo-Fenton catalysis. For photo-Fenton catalysis, the maximum degradation rate of TC (2.5730 min-1) is achieved when the mass ratio of MIL-101(Fe) to Ag3PO4 in the composite is 5:1, which is 31.65- and 3.12-fold of that in the Ag3PO4 + PDS + Sunlight and MIL-101(Fe) + PDS+ Sunlight catalyst systems, respectively. Moreover, the internal conversion of matrix during photocatalysis and Fenton catalysis processes inhibits the photocorrosion of Ag3PO4 and improves the reusability of the composite. Furthermore, it is found that both radical and non-radical species participate in the TC degradation. Besides, the degradation products and catalytic mechanism of Ag3PO4 and Ag3PO4/MIL-101(Fe) systems are explored. The toxicity evaluation results suggest that the intermediates produced during Ag3PO4/MIL-101(Fe) catalysis have a lower biotoxicity than those produced during Ag3PO4 catalysis. Overall, this work provides an effective strategy to inhibit the inherent photocorrosion of Ag3PO4 and establishes an efficient catalytic system for the treatment of organic-contaminated wastewater under natural sunlight conditions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized metastatic melanoma (MM) treatment in just a few years. Ultraviolet (UV) in sunlight is the most significant environmental cause of melanoma, which is considered to be the main reason for tumor mutation burden (TMB) increase in melanoma. High TMB usually predicts that PD-1 inhibitors are effective. The sunlight exposure pattern of MM might be a clinical feature that matches TMB. The relationship between sunlight exposure patterns and immunotherapy response in MM is unclear. This study aims to investigate the correlation between sunlight exposure patterns and immunotherapy response in MM and establish nomograms that predict 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rate. METHODS: We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and enrolled MM cases from 2005-2016. According to the advent of ICIs in 2011, the era was divided into the non-ICIs era (2005-2010) and the ICIs era (2011-2016). Patients were divided into three cohorts according to the primary site sunlight exposure patterns: head and neck in the first cohort, trunk arms and legs in the second cohort, and acral sites in the third cohort. We compared survival differences for each cohort between the two eras, performed stratified analysis, established nomograms for predicting 3- and 5-year OS rate, and performed internal validation. RESULTS: Comparing the survival difference between the ICIs and non-ICIs era, head and neck melanoma showed the greatest improvement in survival, with 3- and 5-year OS rate increasing by 10.2% and 9.1%, respectively (P=0.00011). In trunk arms and legs melanoma, the 3- and 5-year OS rate increased by 4.6% and 3.9%, respectively (P<0.0001). There is no improvement in survival in acral melanoma (AM) between the two eras (P=0.78). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and calibration graphs show good discrimination and accuracy of nomograms. Decision curve analysis (DCA) suggests good clinical utility of nomograms. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the classification of sunlight exposure patterns, there is a gradient difference in immunotherapy efficacy for MM. The degree of sunlight exposure is positively correlated with immunotherapy response. The nomograms are sufficiently accurate to predict 3- and 5-year OS rate for MM, allowing for individualized clinical decisions for future clinical work."

      "abstract": "Nano titanium dioxide (nTiO2) generally shows low toxicity to organisms under light-emitting diode (LED) light. However, nTiO2 can induce production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultraviolet (UV) light due to its photocatalytic activity. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect the enhancement of nTiO2 toxicity under sunlight. To test this hypothesis, we compared the toxicity of nTiO2 to Brachionus calyciflorus under simulated sunlight and LED light. The results showed that the 24 h-LC50 of nTiO2 to B. calyciflorus under LED light and simulated sunlight were 24.32 (95% CI: 14.54-46.81 mg/L) and 10.44 mg/L (95% CI: 6.74-17.09 mg/L), respectively. Compared with the blank control, treatments with nTiO2 significantly affected life-table demographic parameters, population growth parameters and swimming linear speed under both simulated sunlight and LED light. However, life expectancy, net reproductive rate, average lifespan, maximal population density, and swimming linear speed in the treatments of nTiO2 at 0.1, 1, and/or 10 mg/L showed markedly lower values under simulated sunlight than those under LED light, suggesting that simulated sunlight could enhance the toxicity of nTiO2. In addition, markedly higher catalase (CAT) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content but lower glutathione (GSH) content were observed in treatment with 10 mg/L nTiO2 under simulated sunlight than that under LED light. The results showed that compared with LED light, simulated sunlight significantly induced more oxidative stress in the presence of nTiO2, and the ROS production was mainly localized to the corona and digestive tract of rotifers by confocal laser scanning microscope. Exposure to 10-50 μM of vitamin C, that is an effective ROS scavenger, could rescue the swimming linear speed of rotifers to the normal level in the blank control. These results suggested that oxidative damages on cell membrane might be the vital mechanism underlying the toxicity enhancement of nTiO2 to rotifers under simulated sunlight. Thus, the previous publications under LED light may underestimate the real toxicity and environmental risk of nTiO2 in natural conditions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sunlight exposure helps the body produce vitamin D, prevents rickets and is used for neonatal jaundice treatment. Good neonatal sunlight exposure is exposing the neonate to sunlight in the morning, 8:00 to 10:00, for 30 to 60 min. However, little is known about the practice of neonatal sunlight exposure among mothers in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the practices and factors associated with neonatal sunlight exposure among mothers attending public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 420 mothers attending public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling method. The collected data were entered into Epi-data V.4.6 and exported to SPSS V.26 for analysis. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The practice of neonatal sunlight exposure among mothers was 27.1%. Neonatal age of 16-28 days (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.99, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.44), family members of 4-6 (aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.21) and ≥7 (aOR 4.43, 95% CI 1.54 to 12.78), living in compound/villa houses (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.33), complete antenatal care (ANC) follow-up (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.49 to 5.22), delivery at term (aOR 2.54, 95% CI 1.06 to 6.07), poor knowledge of sunlight exposure (aOR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.71) and no fear of sunlight exposure (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.12) were factors associated with the practice of neonatal sunlight exposure. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that 27.1% of mothers had good sunlight exposure. Advanced neonatal age, larger family, living in compound/villa houses, complete ANC visits and term delivery were associated with good practices, whereas poor knowledge and fear of sunlight exposure were associated with poor practices. Therefore, interventions focusing on these findings are required to improve the practice of neonatal sunlight exposure.",

To this end, we present herein the synthesis and characterization of the TiO2/3D-GF/Ni hybrid emphasizing the main structural and morphological properties and the photodegradation process of a highly resistant aromatic azo dye, methyl orange, under both UV light and simulated sunlight. Three-dimensional (3D) graphene was grown by the thermal CVD method on the nickel foam and subsequently coated with thin films of anatase employing the sol-gel method. Thereafter, it was gratifyingly demonstrated that the hybrid nanomaterial, TiO2/3D-GF-Ni, was able to bring about more than 90% decolorization of methyl orange dye after 30 min under simulated sunlight irradiance. Moreover, the efficiency of the methyl orange decolorization was 99.5% after three successive cycles. This high-performance photocatalyst which can effectively decolorize methyl orange will most likely make a great contribution to reducing environmental pollution by employing renewable solar energy."

This research overcomes the key challenges associated with implementing photocatalytic water treatment by using natural sunlight active photocatalyst, changing slurry system, eliminating the use of external triggering sources, and reusing face-mask fabric coated with ZnO to act as a floating photocatalyst. Unique morphological structures-cauliflower, hydrangea, and petals-likes are obtained with the variation in synthesis medium (Diethylene glycol (DEG), N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), H2O) and methods (precipitation, solvothermal) which are found to be dependent on the solvent properties. With the use of DMF having a higher dielectric constant and formation of dimethyl amine via hydrolysis, it influences in forming petals and flower-like morphologies, unlike DEG solvent. The ZnO-coated face-mask fabric is used as the floating photocatalyst under natural sunlight observing comparable 91% degradation efficiency in 100 min with that of 99% efficiency in the UV light-illuminated slurry system. The formation of petals-like structures, defects from the liberation of DMF molecules from the ZnO surface by calcination, larger pore sizes and pore volumes provided a synergistic effect on enhancing the degradation efficiency in these cases.",

      "abstract": "The efficient removal of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in natural waters is vital for human survival and sustainable development. Photocatalytic degradation is a feasible and cost-effective strategy to completely disintegrate POPs at room temperature. Herein, we develop a series of direct Z-scheme BiOIO3/AgIO3 hybrid photocatalysts via a facile deposition-precipitation method. Under natural sunlight irradiation, the light intensity of which is ∼40 mW/cm2, a considerable rate constant of 0.185 min-1 for photodecomposing 40 mg/L MO is obtained over 0.5 g/L Bi@Ag-5 composite photocatalyst powder, about 92.5 and 5.3 times higher than those of pristine AgIO3 and BiOIO3. The photoactivity of Bi@Ag-5 for photodecomposing MO under natural sunlight illumination surpasses most of the reported photocatalysts under Xe lamp illumination. After natural sunlight irradiation for 20 min, 95% of MO, 82% of phenol, 78% of 2,4-DCP, 54% of ofloxacin, and 88% of tetracycline hydrochloride can be photodecomposed over Bi@Ag-5. Relative to the commercial photocatalyst TiO2 (P25), Bi@Ag-5 exhibits greatly higher photoactivity for the treatment of MO-phenol-tetracycline hydrochloride mixture pollutants in the scale-up experiment of 500 mL of solution, decreasing COD, TOC, and chromaticity value by 52, 19, and 76%, respectively, after natural sunlight irradiation for 40 min. The photodegradation process and mechanism of MO have been systematically investigated and proposed. This work provides an archetype for designing efficient photocatalysts to remove POPs.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to synthesize Ag NPs as a green catalyst for photocatalytic activity and to examine their biological activities. It was determined that they have high activity in catalytic and biological activities. The green synthesis which is an environmentally friendly and inexpensive method was used to synthesize Ag-NPs using Linum usitatissimum as a reducing agent. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the Ag NPs. In UV-Vis examination, Ag-NPs had intense peaks in the 435 nm region. The antibacterial activity of Ag NPs was investigated, and Ag NPs showed a high lethal effect against S. aureus, E. coli, B. subtilis, and MRSA. In addition, Ag NPs were tested for anticancer activity against the HT-29 colon cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, healthy cell line L929-Murine Fibroblast cell Lines, and MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cell line at various concentrations (1-160 μg/mL) and showed a high anticancerogenic properties against MDA-MB-231 cells. Ag NPs showed the ability of DNA cleavage activity. Also, the antioxidant activity of Ag NPs against DPPH was found to be 80% approximately. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of Ag NPs against methylene blue (MB) was determined to be 67.13% at the 180th min. In addition, it was observed that biogenic Ag NPs have high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detection. In the sensor based on Ag NPs, linearity from 1 μM to 5 μM was observed with a detection limit (LOD) of 1.323 μM for H2O2. According to these results, we conclude that the biogenic Ag NPs synthesized using Linum usitatissimum extract can be developed as an efficient biological agent as an antibacterial and anticancer also can be used as a photocatalyst for industrial wastewater treatment to prevent wastewater pollution.",

Herein, a simulated sunlight-induced natural organic matter (NOM) for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation was used as pretreatment to alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling caused by NOM itself in the Songhua River water. When light intensity was over 100 mW/cm2, the pretreatment removed NOM effectively, characterized with UV254, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and maximum fluorescent intensity (Fmax), and improved filtration flux. At 200 mW/cm2 light intensity and 0.5 mM PMS, 57.5% of UV254 and 18.5% of DOC were removed, and humic-like fluorescent component was degraded by 84%-94% while ∼60% for protein-like substance. Membrane flux was increased by 94%, and reversible and irreversible fouling resistances were reduced by 62.4% and 51.9%, respectively. Both total fouling index (TFI) and hydraulic irreversible fouling index (HIFI) were moderately correlated with the DOC, whereas they prominently correlated with the UV254 and the Fmaxs of all fluorescence components, which could be served as key indicators to predict and control membrane fouling. Mathematical modeling showed that the pretreatment alleviated the fouling in the membrane pores and cake layer. The simulated sunlight-induced NOM (3NOM* and eaq¯) could activate PMS to form active species, which enabled to oxidize high molecular weight (MW) substances and mineralize low MW compounds in NOM as well as hinder their linking with inorganic cations, thereby reducing organic and inorganic membrane fouling simultaneously. This study may provide a new strategy for decentralized potable water treatment, especially in a single household or community.",

In this work, the effective charge carrier separating Sn/Mn-ZnFe2O4-CdFe2O4-Ag3PO4 Quantum dots (M/SZFO-CFO-AP QDs) was fabricated for photocatalytic degradation of doxycycline (doxy) antibiotic. The result showed enhanced photocatalytic activity of doxy and the degradation efficiency of doxy was about 98.8% in short span of time. The calculated WH plot and urbach energy of prepared photocatalyst exhibited evidence for the prevalence of point defects and its contribution to efficient charge separation and transferability. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal was found to be 98.9%, which depicts the complete mineralization of doxy. The synergetic charge transfer of n-p-n heterojunction enables the effective removal of doxy under visible light irradiation. Further, the genotoxicity study was determined by interacting the SZFO-CFO-AP QDs with Allium Cepa. The results depict that SZFO-CFO-AP QDs show lower toxicity level and there were no trace of defective mitotic phases and micro nuclei. Further, the progression and development of bean plant was determined after treating with prepared nanomaterials and the result showed the enhanced growth in SZFO-CFO-AP QDs treated bean plant compared to the counterparts. Therefore, the prepared SZFO-CFO-AP QDs was can be used as an environmental friendly photocatalyst for effective treatment of antibiotic present in the water bodies.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the influence of environmental factors like pH on solar disinfection in sunlight-dependent wastewater treatment systems can aid in improving their design. Previous research found pH to influence the solar disinfection rates of bacteria in water containing exogenous photosensitizers that facilitate photo-oxidative inactivation. However, limited research has been conducted on the role of external pH on endogenous solar inactivation processes that occur independent of exogenous photosensitizers. As such, we studied the inactivation rates of laboratory-cultured and wastewater-sourced E. coli and enterococci in sensitizer-free matrices with pH ranging from 4 to 10 under full-spectrum and UVB-filtered simulated sunlight. Elevated solar inactivation rates were observed at pH 4 for all bacterial populations evaluated, and at pH 10 for laboratory-cultured and wastewater-sourced E. coli. Dark inactivation was observed at the pH extremes for some bacteria, but did not contribute significantly to the increased inactivation rates observed under simulated sunlight at these pH, except for laboratory-cultured E. coli at pH 10. UVB light was found to play an important role in sunlight inactivation, albeit the contribution of UVB light to solar inactivation observed for Enterococcus spp. diminished at pH 4 and 5, suggesting that indirect endogenous inactivation pathways facilitated by longer wavelength light were enhanced under acidic conditions. Our findings demonstrate that external pH affects the kinetics of endogenous sunlight inactivation processes, and the results have potential to be integrated into models for predicting inactivation kinetics in sunlight-mediated treatment systems that operate over a range of pH conditions.",

      "abstract": "Benzotriazole (BT) and 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (5-MeBT) are the most commonly used UV stabilizers and recalcitrant contaminants that are widely distributed in aquatic environments. The novelty of this study was to investigate the role of RCSs in the enhanced degradation of BT and 5-MeBT during the sunlight/free chlorine process. The results showed that sunlight/free chlorine could enhance the degradation of BT and 5-MeBT compared with that obtained with sunlight irradiation and chlorination alone, and this process was well described by pseudo-first-order kinetics. The degradation rate constants of BT and 5-MeBT during sunlight/free chlorine treatment at pH 7 were 0.094 ± 0.001 min-1 and 0.134 ± 0.002 min-1, respectively. The degradation rates further increased with increases in the chlorine dosage and under alkaline conditions (3.818 ± 0.243 min-1 for BT and 7.754 ± 0.716 min-1 for 5-MeBT at pH 9). The enhanced removal obtained during the sunlight/free chlorine process could be attributed to the generation of HO• and reactive chlorine species (RCSs), such as Cl• and ClO•. Under alkaline conditions, RCSs were the dominant reactive species, and their contribution increased from 21.2% to 98.7% with increases in the pH from 7 to 9; this phenomenon was due to changes in free chlorine and BT speciation. Radical scavenging tests further verified that BT was mainly decomposed by ClO•, and ClO• showed high reactivity toward deprotonated BT through second-order rate constant estimation. A byproduct analysis demonstrated that BT underwent hydroxylation and chlorine substitution, and a high yield of 1-chlorobenzotriazole (1-ClBT) formation was observed. Even though the sunlight/free chlorine process resulted in a low level of mineralization, no Microtox® toxicity was detected in the treated solutions. Briefly, the significant contribution of ClO• to BT removal under alkaline conditions implies that sunlight/free chlorine could be utilized in a broader range of treatment conditions.",

DESIGN: Open-label randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Public hospital in Northern India (28.7°N). PARTICIPANT: Breastfed infants at 6-8 weeks of age. INTERVENTION: Randomized to receive sunlight exposure (40% body surface area for a minimum of 30 minutes/week) or oral vitamin D3 supplementation (400 IU/day) till 6 months of age. OUTCOME: Primary - proportion of infants having vitamin D sufficiency (>20 ng/mL). Secondary - proportion of infants developing vitamin D deficiency (<12ng/mL) and rickets in both the groups at 6 months of age. RESULTS: Eighty (40 in each group) infants with mean (SD) age 47.8 (4.5) days were enrolled. The proportion of infants with vitamin D sufficiency increased after intervention in the vitamin D group from 10.8% to 35.1% (P=0.01) but remained the same in sunlight group (13.9%) and was significant on comparison between both groups (P=0.037). The mean (SD) compliance rate was 72.9 (3.4) % and 59.7 (23.6) % in the vitamin D and sunlight group, respectively (P=0.01). The geometric mean (95% CI) serum 25(OH) D levels in the vitamin D and sunlight group were 16.23 (13.58-19.40) and 11.89 (9.93-14.23) ng/mL, respectively; (P=0.02), after adjusting baseline serum 25(OH)D with a geometric mean ratio of 1.36 (1.06-1.76). Two infants in sunlight group developed rickets. CONCLUSION: Oral vitamin D3 supplementation is more efficacious than sunlight in achieving vitamin D sufficiency in breastfed infants during the first 6 months of life due to better compliance.",

In this report we describe the first two cases of solar maculopathy in individuals exposed to sunlight reflected from the screen of mobile devices in the absence of direct sun gaze. CASES DESCRIPTION: Case 1. A 30-year-old Caucasic man presented with bilateral metamorphopsia, central scotoma and decreased visual acuity two days after being reading for four hours with his tablet computer in a terrace of a ski center. CASE 2: A 20-year-old Caucasic woman was examined for bilateral decrease of visual acuity and central scotoma after being at the beach the day before and reading with her mobile phone for 3 hours. Both patients denied gazing directly to sunlight at any moment. In each case, exploration revealed fundus and OCT images compatible with the typical features of solar maculopathy. After 2 years of follow-up, in absence of any specific treatment, Case 1 had a complete resolution of the fundus alterations, while Case 2 still presented defects of the outer retinal layers. In both cases, an exposure to sunlight reflected from the screen of their mobile devices was documented in environments where solar radiation is thought to be augmented. CONCLUSION: Sunlight reflection from a display screen needs to be considered as a possible risk factor for increased solar radiation and a subsequent risk of solar maculopathy.",

This catalyst has also been used for photodegrading organic dyes like methylene blue. MoO2(PO3)2 has been shown to complete photoreduction of toxic Cr6+ to Cr3+ in 6 min and achieved 78% degradation efficiency for methylene blue in 36 min.

To further explore the cause of the biotoxicity changes, the relationships between the spectral or molecular level parameters (obtained from FT-ICR MS analysis) and biotoxicity were assessed using correlation analysis. The molecules in <1 kDa EfOM with lower molecular weight, higher unsaturation degree, and higher humification and fluorescence had higher luminescent bacteria toxicity under sunlight irradiation. However, in the <1 kDa SRNOM, the molecules which were characterized by higher humification and fluorescence had higher luminescent bacteria toxicity. The notable genotoxicity reduction of EfOM under sunlight irradiation was attributed to the photochemical degradation of components with a high unsaturation degree. Such findings could enable ecological safety improvement of aquatic environments using natural sunlight.",

Herein, a cheap and eco-friendly natural loess particle (LoP) was used for in situ growth of tungsten trioxide nanocubes (WO3NCs) on its surface via a simple one-pot hydrothermal method, which afforded a stable loess-based photocatalyst (WO3NCs@LoP). It was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic performances of WO3NCs@LoP were applied to photodegradation of organics under visible-light illumination. It was found that the removal rate of methylene blue (MB) got to 99% within 20 min, which was higher than that of materials, such as pure LoP and WO3NCs. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of WO3NCs@LoP remained 85% after 9 cycling times, indicating its high stability and reusability. It was suggested that the synergy of the well narrowed band gap and effectual control of e--h+ recombination in WO3NCs@LoP improve its photodegradation efficiency. In summary, using natural minerals (LoP) as carrier, a novel eco-friendly photocatalyst could be explored for photodegradation of organic pollutions in wastewater treatment.",

      "abstract": "Water pollution and deficient energy are the main challenges for the scientific society across the world. In this trend, new approaches include designing zinc oxide nanohybrids to be very active in sunlight. In this line, organic and magnetic species intercalate among the nanolayers of Al/Zn to build inorganic-magnetic-organic nanohybrid structures. A series of nanolayered and nanohybrid structures have been prepared through intercalating very fine particles of cobalt iron oxide nanocomposites and long chains of organic fatty acids such as n-capric acid and stearic acid inside the nanolayered structures of Al/Zn. By thermal treatment, zinc oxide nanohybrids have been prepared and used for purifying water from colored pollutants using solar energy. The optical measurements have shown that the nanohybrid structure of zinc oxide leads to a clear reduction of band gap energy from 3.30 eV to 2.60 eV to be effective in sunlight. In this line, a complete removal of the colored pollutants (naphthol green B) was achieved after ten minutes in the presence of zinc oxide nanohybrid and sunlight. Finally, this new approach for designing photoactive nanohybrids leads to positive results for facing the energy- and water-related problems through using renewable and non-polluting energy for purifying water."

METHODS: The magnetic nanocomposite used was first synthesized and then characterized using TEM, SEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, XRF and BET advanced techniques. The removal of the Cr (VI) was performed through a batch adsorption approach and the effects of sample pH (A; 2-6), initial chromate concentration (B; 50-100 ppm) and adsorbent weight to sample volume ratio (C; 1-3 mg ml-1), hole scavenger (0.1 -0.3%w/v) and time (E; 30-60 min), to evaluate the individual and interactive effects under ultraviolet light conditions, were also studied by the central composite design in the photocatalytic process of adsorption. RESULTS: The adsorption-photocatalytic performance of the CoFe2O4/SiO2/MnO2 composite was high in which 98.1% of Cr(VI) after 30 min of photocatalytic treatment in optimum conditions (i.e. pH = 3, catalyst concentration = 2 mg L-1, Cr(VI) concentration = 200 mg L-1, and hole scavenger concentration = 0.4% (w/ v), At laboratory temperature, speed = 400 rpm, under UV radiation).Under optimum conditions, Cr(VI) reductive followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and followed the Langmuir and Temkin isotherms, also, positive value of ΔH° indicates endothermic nature. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the synthesized CoFe2O4/SiO2/MnO2 magnetic nanocomposite holds a great potential for use as a photocatalyst to remove Cr (VI) in adsorption reactions. It can be used as an effective catalyst in the eradication of Cr (VI) wastewater.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate short-term and long-term status of monocular eye closure in sunlight after surgical treatment of intermittent exotropia. METHODS: The medical records of consecutive patients 4 years and older who underwent surgery for intermittent exotropia with monocular eye closure in sunlight were reviewed retrospectively. Monocular eye closure status on short-term and long-term postoperative follow-up was analyzed to determine whether the status on short-term follow-up remained or changed on long-term follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were included (mean age: 10.64 ± 6.05 years). Thirteen patients (35%) were postoperatively observed for 6 months or less (short-term) and 24 (65%) for a mean 7.12 ± 2.89 years (long-term). Monocular eye closure disappeared in 16 patients (43%) and persisted in 21 (57%) on short-term follow-up. There was no significant difference in eye closure status between short-term and long-term follow-up in 24 patients. Eight of 9 patients (89%) with disappearance of eye closure on short-term follow-up maintained this status on long-term follow-up and 1 patient (11%) had reappearance of eye closure. Eleven of 15 patients (73%) with persistence of eye closure on short-term follow-up maintained this status on long-term follow-up and 4 (27%) had disappearance of eye closure. Three patients had a fluctuation in eye closure status during long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Monocular eye closure disappeared in nearly 40% of patients on short-term follow-up and in 50% on long-term follow-up after surgery for intermittent exotropia. Monocular eye closure status on short-term follow-up remained on long-term follow-up in most patients and changed in a few patients. [J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 2023;60(2):114-119.].",

      "abstract": "The use of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) for veterinary, human therapy, and agriculture has risen in the past few decades, making it to become one of the most exploited antibiotics. However, TCH residue in the environment is causing issues related to the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. To address such a problem, photodegradation offers a potential solution to decompose these pollutants in wastewater and thereby mitigates negative environmental impacts. In this context, the research focuses on the use of the rare-earth metal oxide samarium orthovanadate (SmVO4) with nanorod structure, coupled with UiO-66-NH2 for the photocatalytic degradation. Their photocatalytic activity to degrade antibiotic TCH molecules is explored under simulated solar light irradiation. The integration of UiO-66-NH2 with SmVO4 enhanced the light absorption, recombination resistance, carrier lifetime (from 0.382 to 0.411 ns) and specific surface area (from 67.17 to 246 m2/g) of the composite system as confirmed from multiple analyses. The obtained results further indicated that SmVO4/UiO-66-NH2 nanocomposites could form a direct Z-scheme based heterojunction. Such mechanism of charge transfer leads to the effective degradation of TCH molecules up to 50% in 90 min under solar light, while it is degraded only 30% in the case of bare-SmVO4 nanorods. In this work, the incorporation of UiO-66-NH2 positively influences photoelectrochemical properties and improves the overall photoredox properties of SmVO4 for the degradation of complex compounds like antibiotic TCH molecules. Therefore, UiO-66-NH2 can be proposed as an effective material to sensitize the rare-earth based photocatalytic material.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the differences in the color changes of unsteamed and steamed beech wood (Fagus sylvatica L.) caused by long-term exposure to sunlight on the surface of wood in interiors for 36 months. The light white-gray color of the yellow tinge of native beech wood darkened under the influence of sunlight, and the wood took on a pale brown color of yellow tinge. The degree of darkening and browning is quantified by the value of the total color difference ∆E* = 13.0. The deep brown-red color of steamed beech under the influence of sunlight during the exposure brightened, and the surface of the wood took on a pale brown hue. The degree of lightening of the color of steamed beech wood in the color space CIE L*a*b* is quantified by the value of the total color difference ∆E* = 7.1. A comparison of the color changes of unsteamed and steamed beech wood through the total color difference ∆E* due to daylight shows that the surface of steamed beech wood shows 52.2% smaller changes than unsteamed beech wood. The lower value of the total color difference of steamed beech wood indicates the fact that steaming of beech wood with saturated water steam has a positive effect on the color stability and partial resistance of steamed beech wood to the initiation of photochemical reactions induced by UV-VIS wavelengths of solar radiation. Spectra ATR-FTIR analyses declare the influence of UV-VIS components of solar radiation on unsteamed and steamed beech wood and confirm the higher color stability of steamed beech wood."

      "abstract": "Accessibility of adequate safe and fresh water for human consumption is one of the most significant issues throughout the world and extensive research is being undertaken to resolve it. Nanotechnology is now an outstanding medium for water treatment and remediation from microorganisms and organic dyes, as compared to conventional treatment methods. For this task graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a potential nanomaterial for environmental remediation, but its photogenerated charge carrier recombination rate restricts its use in practical applications. Hence, in the current study, we used a simple one-step calcination method to synthesize various ratios of ZnO/g-C3N4 binary nanocomposites. The band gap of g-C3N4 is 2.70 eV, but it is shifted to 2.60 eV by the 0.75 : 1 ZnO/g-C3N4 binary nanocomposite. Moreover, phase structure, morphology, thermal stability, oxidation state, elemental analysis, and surface area were evaluated using XRD, SEM, TEM, TGA, XPS, and BET analysis. The optimal ZnO loading content was determined and the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity was studied in detail. The photocatalytic efficiency of the best catalyst was employed for the degradation of textile effluent followed by phytotoxicity evaluation using methylene blue (MB), and rhodamine B (RhB) as a model substrate was tested. Furthermore, the textile effluent treatment analysis discovered that the 75 mg concentration of 0.75 : 1 ZnO/g-C3N4 catalyst degraded up to 80% within 120 min and significantly reduced the concentrations of different physico-chemical parameters of textile effluents. These treated effluents have no phytotoxic effects on fenugreek plants, according to a pot study. It was found that the mesoporous 0.75 : 1 ZnO/g-C3N4 catalyst can be used as an effective and low-cost technique for the degradation of azo dyes in textile wastewaters."

XRD, TEM, EDS, XPS, DRS, and PL techniques were used to examine the structurally and morphologically properties of the prepared samples. The XRD results appeared that the Fe3O4-FeVO4 has a triclinic crystal structure. Under hydrothermal treatment, (GO) was effectively reduced to (RGO) as illustrated by XRD and XPS results. UV-Vis analysis revealed that the addition of RGO enhanced the absorption in the visible region and narrowed the band gap energy. The photoactivities of the prepared samples were evaluated by degrading methylene blue (MB), phenol and brilliant green under sunlight illumination. As indicated by all the nanocomposites, photocatalytic activity was higher than the pure Fe3O4-FeVO4 photocatalyst, and the highest photodegradation efficiency of MB and phenol was shown by the 10%RGO/Fe3O4-FeVO4. In addition, the study examined the mineralization (TOC), photodegradation process, and photocatalytic reaction kinetics of MB and phenol.",
