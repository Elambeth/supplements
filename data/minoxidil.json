      "abstract": "Topical minoxidil is the mainstay of treatment for androgenic alopecia and is also used off-label for other forms of hair loss. Despite its efficacy and favourable safety profile, the use of minoxidil is associated with various side effects, the most commonly reported of which is contact dermatitis. A clear distinction between allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis to minoxidil is critical for management of androgenic alopecia. This article presents a systematic review of the current literature, evaluating minoxidil-induced allergic contact dermatitis. Of the 251 records identified through the database search, a total of 21 studies were included in the review. Most patients presented with classic signs of contact dermatitis, including erythema, pruritus, and increased scaling of the scalp. Of the patients with positive patch tests, a total of 54 patients showed sensitization to minoxidil itself and 12 patients to vehicle components. Patients with suspected signs of contact dermatitis such as erythema, scaling, and pruritus after minoxidil application should undergo patch testing to confirm or exclude allergy. For the test, the differential reactivity of minoxidil in various vehicles should be considered. Patients who are sensitive to propylene glycol should be offered alternative minoxidil formulations.",

      "abstract": "Androgenic alopecia (AGA) represents one of the most prevalent forms of hair loss. Liposomes (LPSs), acting as a localized dermal drug reservoir with sustained release property, can effectively prolong and enhance drug retention within the skin. Minoxidil sulfate (MXS), a potent active metabolite of minoxidil (MX) for promoting hair growth, exhibits instability in aqueous solution and faces difficulties in depositing within the deep dermal hair follicle regions. In this study, MXS-LPSs were fabricated via the thin-film hydration-dispersion method combined with an ammonium sulfate gradient active drug loading process, and their physicochemical characteristics were comprehensively characterized. The skin permeation/deposition properties of the drug from the MXS-LPSs were investigated by Franz diffusion cell method on ex vivo rat skin, and the mechanism underlying the targeted drug delivery of LPSs to hair follicles was explored by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The pharmacodynamic evaluation of MXS-LPSs was carried out in AGA model rats. The optimized MXS-LPSs were uniformly dispersed with enhanced stability. The average vesicle size of MXS-LPSs was 129.46 ± 7.04 nm, the zeta potential was -25.57 ± 4.79 mV, the encapsulation efficiency (EE) was 92.72 ± 0.75 %, and the drug loading (DL) was 2.80 ± 0.12 %. The results of ex vivo skin permeation/deposition showed that the cumulative permeated drug amount (Qn) from MXS-LPS, MX tincture and MXS solution at 36 h was 225.98 ± 11.53, 19.79 ± 1.97 and 584.42 ± 2.33 μg·cm-2, respectively. The deposited drug amount in the skin beneath the stratum corneum from MXS-LPSs, MX tincture and MXS solution accounted for about 59.80 ± 26.27 %, 43.18 ± 6.58 % and 32.55 ± 1.61 % of that in the whole skin, respectively. It is remarkable that MXS-LPSs showed a considerably increased accumulation in hair follicles when compared to MXS solution. The results of pharmacodynamic tests demonstrated that, compared to MX tincture, MXS-LPSs could more effectively stimulate hair regrowth and avoided the adverse effects. Importantly, the MXS-LPSs also reduced skin irritation and sensitization. Consequently, MXS-LPSs hold substantial promise in the treatment of AGA."

METHODS: Animal studies were conducted on mice over 28 days, involving minoxidil (positive control), kopexil (test), and negative control groups. Morphological characteristics of skin and hair were assessed. Levels of hair growth-promoting markers (HGF and VEGF) were determined through western blot analysis. Toxic effects were examined by isolating and weighing the kidneys and livers, followed by histological examination. RESULTS: The kopexil group demonstrated significant increases in hair weight, follicle count, percentage of anagen hair, and hair growth compared to the minoxidil. Western blot analysis revealed higher expression levels of hair growth-promoting factors in the kopexil-treated group. No statistically significant differences in liver and kidney weights or noticeable morphological variations were observed in the toxicity tests across the groups. CONCLUSION: The 5% (w/v) hydro-alcoholic solution containing kopexil proved to be an effective hair growth stimulator, influencing various factors. Its daily use can be considered a suitable treatment method for stimulating hair growth, given its improved effectiveness and ease of use for patients."

Oral minoxidil, in doses below those likely to lower blood pressure (so called \"low dose oral minoxidil\") has increasingly been used off label to treat a variety of hair loss conditions but without any standard recommended best practices. OBJECTIVES: To provide a review of how experts in hair loss use the available literature on topical and low dose oral minoxidil to educate and treat safely and effectively patients with hair loss METHODS: Dermatologists with expertise in hair disorders met by teleconference and email to review the literature and share their direct experience with topical and oral minoxidil. RESULTS: Provision of basic knowledge of the key aspects of the use of topical or oral minoxidil to insure safe and effective use of either in treating hair loss."

In this paper, using our previous alcohol-free low surfactant microemulsion technology with VES as auxiliary oil phase, microemulsions loaded with the inclusion complex of MXD and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) were prepared, optimized and characterized, and the therapeutic effect on AGA C57BL/6 mice was compared with MXD/SCD@TF. According to the ternary phase diagram, steady-state permeation rate of MXD through SD rat skin and drug retention, MXD/SCD@ME was selected as the optimal prescription, composed of 5.25% oil phase, 9.75% surfactants, 10.20% SBE-β-CD, 1.02% MXD and 73.78% water, which conformed to the characteristics of microemulsion. MXD/SCD@ME had good stability, and the application of inclusion technology increased the MXD loading in microemulsion to nearly 5 times. The results of in vivo skin penetration test and laser confocal scanning visualization showed that MXD/SCD@ME was easier to deliver drugs to deeper skin tissues than MXD/SCD@TF. Hair regeneration study demonstrated that MXD/SCD@ME had higher ability than MXD/SCD@TF in promoting hair growth, prolonging hair growth period, reducing ROS level and promoting cell proliferation of hair follicles. In addition, the blank microemulsion of MXD/SCD@ME had certain therapeutic effect on AGA, indicating the synergistic effect between VES and MXD. All these indicated that MXD/SCD@ME is expected to provide a better choice for pharmacological therapy of MXD on AGA than MXD/SCD@TF."

Topical finasteride offers a potential alternative with similar efficacy and fewer systemic side effects. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of combining topical finasteride and minoxidil for male AGA. This 12-week randomized controlled trial divided subjects into two groups which are topical finasteride 0.1%-minoxidil 5% (treatment) and topical minoxidil 5% (control) (NCT05990400, registered 2023-08-04). Hair density, hair diameter, terminal hair rate, and vellus hair rate (assessed using phototrichogram), and the occurrence of side effects (SE) was monitored at four-week intervals. Out of 40 subjects, 2 dropped out in the treatment group. Significant increases in hair density, diameter, and terminal hair rate; and decrease of vellus hair rate were observed at each visit compared to baseline, yet no differences between groups. Systemic SEs included libido reduction (control), mild erectile dysfunction, and chest pain (treatment). Common local SEs (itching, shedding, and dandruff) were similar between groups. One patient (treatment) experienced contact dermatitis. Combining topical finasteride 0.1% with topical minoxidil 5% has similar safety and effectiveness for increasing hair density and diameter in male AGA patients compared to topical minoxidil 5% after 12 weeks of observation.",

      "abstract": "Low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) has emerged as a widely used off-label treatment for different types of alopecia, showing a favorable safety profile and effectiveness. Despite its growing use, it is essential to understand the possible associated adverse events (AEs) and their appropriate management to optimize this therapy. The aim of this article was to comprehensively review the AEs of LDOM treatment, describing their frequency, risk factors, affected anatomical sites, and management strategies. A search in the PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed for studies published before 31 December 2024, reporting the treatment of any type of hair loss with oral minoxidil. The most frequent AE is hypertrichosis, occurring in approximately 15% of patients, with a higher incidence in women and patients with higher doses. Fluid retention affects 1.3-10% of patients, particularly women, and typically occurs within 1-3 months of treatment. Other cardiovascular AEs, such as tachycardia or dizziness, occur in fewer than 5% of cases and are usually mild and transient. Severe AEs, including pericardial effusion, are extremely rare and often linked to compounding errors comprising an excessive dose. Management strategies include dose reduction, pharmacological interventions like diuretics for edema, and lifestyle measures such as sodium restriction. In most cases, AEs resolve without the need for treatment discontinuation. The favorable safety profile of LDOM makes it a valuable therapeutic option for alopecia, though careful patient selection, dose titration, and monitoring are essential to minimize risks."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a common hair loss condition characterized by follicular miniaturization. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in promoting angiogenesis and supporting hair follicle growth. Oral minoxidil has been suggested to upregulate VEGF levels, enhancing hair regrowth. METHODS: This prospective study included 50 participants divided into two groups: oral minoxidil (1 mg/day; n = 25) and control (n = 25). Serum VEGF levels were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Hair growth parameters, including hair count, diameter, shedding, and pull test results, were assessed systematically. RESULTS: Baseline VEGF levels were similar between groups (p = 0.1873). Post-treatment, VEGF levels increased significantly in the minoxidil group (217.88 ± 22.65 pg/ml vs. 142.81 ± 23.14 pg/ml in the control, p < 0.0001). Hair count and diameter improved significantly (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0040, respectively), with reductions in shedding and pull test results (p < 0.0001). Positive correlations were observed between VEGF and hair count (r = 0.9965), whereas shedding showed negative correlations (r = -0.5374). CONCLUSIONS: Oral minoxidil significantly enhances VEGF levels, promoting hair growth and reducing shedding. VEGF serves as a promising biomarker for assessing treatment effectiveness and understanding the angiogenic mechanisms involved in AGA.",

This study aimed to investigate the facticity of the temporal increase in the hair shedding amount after topical use of minoxidil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 49 patients who used 2% or 5% minoxidil topically to treat androgenetic alopecia for 24 weeks. The amount of hair shedding was recorded every four weeks before and after the treatment. The BASP classification and trichoscopy test results were also recorded before and after the treatment. The relative amount of hair shedding (RAHS) was defined as the recorded number of hair shedding after normalization. The correlation between the maximum RAHS (MRAHS) and the sulfotransferase activity as well as the therapeutic effect was calculated. RESULTS: A temporary increase in the amount of hair shedding was detected in the first 12 weeks. This increase has a longer duration in patients treated with 2% minoxidil compared to 5%. Its severity was correlated with the improvement of trichoscopy tests only in patients with 5% minoxidil but not in 2%. However, both patients in the 2% and 5% minoxidil groups had a significant association between the MRAHS and the improvement in BASP classification. CONCLUSION: The amount of hair shedding increases temporarily after the topical minoxidil use, the level of which is a potential treatment efficacy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is one of the most common forms of diffuse alopecia in females. Despite the availability of multiple treatment options, FPHL management poses challenges for the dermatologist. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of topical finasteride 1% solution and spironolactone 5% solution to minoxidil 5% solution in the treatment of FPHL clinically and trichoscopically. METHODS: Forty-five adult female patients diagnosed with FPHL were divided into three groups of 15 each. Group A was treated with topical finasteride 1%, group B used topical spironolactone 5%, and group C was treated with topical minoxidil solution 5 %, all groups were treated for 16 weeks. RESULTS: By the end of 16th week, significant improvement on the Sinclair scale was observed in groups A and C, but the difference between the three groups was statistically insignificant. Trichoscopically, hair density significantly increased in groups A and C. There was a significant reduction in the number of patients with yellow dots, peripilar sign, and single hair follicular units (FU) in group A. In group C, a significant reduction in the number of patients with yellow dots and single hair FU was documented. No trichoscopic changes were detected in group B. CONCLUSIONS: Topical finasteride is as safe and effective as topical minoxidil in FPHL. Both treatments showed greater effectiveness clinically and trichoscopically than topical spironolactone. The use of topical finasteride may be another solution for the treatment of FPHL in minoxidil non-responders or in the presence of intolerable side effects."

The compound gel not only had good semi-solid properties and the effect of permeation but also maintained stability for up to 3 months under accelerated conditions, ensuring the long-term quality of the formulation. This compound gel can effectively improve hair follicle growth and significantly alleviate local inflammatory response by downregulation of the ratio of inflammatory factor interferon-γ to anti-inflammatory factor interleukin-4 in C3H/HeN mice bearing AA, achieving the purpose of synergistic treatment of AA. The first combination of minoxidil and tofacitinib in a topical formulation gives a new idea for the clinical treatment of AA.",

      "abstract": "Minoxidil has become an increasingly popular treatment option for hair loss disorders including androgenetic alopecia, cicatricial alopecia, and alopecia areata. There are various minoxidil formulations available including topical, oral, and injectable minoxidil. While injectable minoxidil may offer certain advantages, potential risks and costs should also be considered. First, we explore the enhanced bioavailability of injectable minoxidil in comparison to topical and oral formulations, as well as the variability in sulfotransferase enzyme levels and its role in the activation of minoxidil at hair follicles. Furthermore, we expand upon the potential adverse effects associated with injectable minoxidil given its widespread systemic distribution. We also highlight the importance of considering cost, access, and availability of injectable minoxidil given that injections are significantly more expensive than oral minoxidil tablets and involve the additional obstacle of frequent dermatology visits. Depending on geographic region and socioeconomic status, many patients may not live in sufficiently close proximity to a dermatologist for this level of care. Finally, we emphasize the need for ongoing research efforts to compare the efficacy, access, and tolerability of injectable minoxidil, alternative minoxidil formulations, and other alopecia medications.",

However, the optimal dose has not yet been determined, and high doses may cause systemic adverse effects. This retrospective study of 57 patients evaluated the safety and efficacy profile of oral minoxidil at higher doses (>5mg). Results showed an overall improvement in hair density between 10-30% in most patients, although with variable responses. A total of 17.5% of patients experienced significant improvements (>50%), while another 17.5% improved <10%. A quarter of the patients (24.6%) developed adverse effects, such as hypertrichosis (17.5%) and tachycardia (3.5%). Although it is a promising therapeutic option, higher doses of oral minoxidil require further studies to optimize its use and better understand its safety and efficacy profile."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42024594487) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CMNT versus minoxidil alone for AGA, following PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search across six databases was performed up to September 8, 2024. We identified 12 RCTs involving 631 AGA patients, with a total of 11 RCTs included in the meta-analyses. CMNT significantly improved hair count compared to minoxidil monotherapy (SMD 1.32, 95% CI 0.73-1.92, p < 0.01), with substantial heterogeneity (I² = 88%, p < 0.01). Subgroup analyses indicated no significant effect of microneedling (MN) depth (≤ 1 mm vs. >1 mm), duration (≤ 12 weeks vs. >12 weeks), or technique(device) (electrodynamic vs. rolling) on hair count outcomes. Additionally, A meta-analysis of six RCTs demonstrated a significant improvement in hair diameter with CMNT (SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.11-0.58; p < 0.01), with no observed heterogeneity (I² = 0%). Investigators and patient's self-assessment scores were also improved. Adverse events were more frequent with CMNT (74 vs. 59 events), however they were generally considered mild or self-limiting. CMNT significantly enhances hair count and diameter in AGA patients with mild adverse events. MN parameters including depth, duration, and technique variations did not significantly affect hair count outcome, suggesting microneedling as a promising adjunctive AGA treatment.",

There is growing interest in bicalutamide for this purpose, but its efficacy in treating FPHL has not been evaluated in clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of 25 mg/d bicalutamide combined with 1 mg/d minoxidil compared to 1 mg/d minoxidil monotherapy over 24 weeks for FPHL treatment. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial enrolled 74 participants into 2 groups: bicalutamide 25 mg/d plus minoxidil 1 mg/d or placebo plus minoxidil 1 mg/d for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in total hair density in the target area. RESULT: Sixty-four (86.5%) participants completed the study (32 per group). There was a mean increase of 18.1 hairs/cm2 in the bicalutamide-minoxidil group and 21.5 hairs/cm2 in the minoxidil group (P = .86). According to the global consensus analysis of clinical photographs, there was no difference in clinical improvement between the groups (P = .78). LIMITATIONS: Single-center study and short follow-up period (24 weeks). CONCLUSION: Bicalutamide 25 mg/d combined with minoxidil 1 mg/d did not provide additional improvement in FPHL treatment compared to minoxidil alone after 24 weeks."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Hair loss affects significant social and psychological well-being issues of the person. Thus, various drugs, ingredients, and technologies are being developed to overcome it. Minoxidil (MXD) is a representative hair loss treatment drug because it suppresses the production of dihydrotestosterone and induces vasodilation. However, since MXD has various side effects when used orally, it is more desirable to use it topically. In this work, we disclosed a new polymeric formulation (MXD@CP) based on citric acid (CA) dimethylsiloxane polymer (CP) for the effective transdermal delivery of MXD. METHODS: The polymer that induced ring-opening polymerization based on CA was named CA-siloxane polymer (CP). After CP synthesis, MXD was loaded onto CP to form MXD@CP. The formed MXD@CP was confirmed to have efficacy as a transdermal delivery system through various material property analyses and biotoxicity and therapeutic efficacy analyses. RESULTS: In these results, CP stably loaded MXD up to 5%, a concentration used in clinical practice, and showed higher hair growth efficacy and hair follicle formation efficacy compared to MXD@PBS. CONCLUSION: In the animal study, MXD@CP showed a superior hair growth effect which suggests its potential as a next-generation hair loss treatment agent.

This hereditary and androgen-dependent disorder tends to progress into partial or even complete baldness Several therapeutic options are now available for AGA, including conventional medications such as finasteride, dutasteride, and minoxidil. However, side effects of these medications are also commonly reported. The use of adipose derived stem cells and their secreted bioactive molecules, \"secretome\" has gained attention which could produce many effects for hair growth promotion and has been proven in clinical trials. This study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of with minoxidil in androgenetic alopecia cases. 60 subjects were divided into three treatment groups (minoxidil only, secretome only, and combination of both) and were given intervention on week 0, 4, and 8. All subjects were evaluated by physical examination, photography, trichoscopy, and trichoscan until week 12. All groups showed a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) on hair growth parameters with the best improvement observed on week 12. The combination group had the best improvement substantially on hair growth parameters. Side effects are minimum and reported by the subjects in minoxidil group. Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT06066827.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Male pattern baldness (MPB) also known as androgenetic alopecia (AA) affects approximately half of men by the fifth decade, and significantly influences both psychological well-being and quality of life. Existing pharmacotherapies include oral finasteride, which reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels and slows follicular miniaturization, and topical minoxidil, which enhances follicular blood flow and extends the anagen phase. However, adherence to topical regimens can be suboptimal. A combined oral low-dose minoxidil (2.5 mg)-finasteride (1 mg) \"All-in-One\" regimen could improve convenience, adherence, and possibly efficacy. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study sought to (i) assess the efficacy of a combined oral minoxidil-finasteride therapy over 12 months in a real-world AA cohort; (ii) determine inter-rater reliability of hair loss scoring metrics; and (iii) examine how baseline Norwood severity influences outcomes and effect sizes. METHODS: Data were collected from a UK-based digital health service between January 2020 and December 2023. Eligible men, aged ≥18, with Norwood stages 2-7 AA, initiated combined oral therapy. All had baseline and 12-month follow-up images. The primary outcome was the mean change in hair density according to a clinician-rated 7-point scale. A one-sample t-test compared the mean change to zero (no change). Cohen's d and Hedge's g estimated effect sizes, and Cohen's kappa assessed inter-rater reliability. RESULTS: Out of 502 men, 92.4% (N = 464) achieved stable or improved outcomes (≥0), and 57.4% (N = 288) showed marked improvements (>0). The inverse-variance weighted mean 7-point change was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.51-0.65; p<0.001; N = 502), indicating significant improvement relative to no change. More severe baseline categories achieved equal or greater gains, with effect sizes up to d≈1.0. Kappa values were modest (Norwood: κ=0.33; 7-point: κ=0.20), indicating fair to slight agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The combined oral minoxidil-finasteride regimen produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements (p<0.001; N = 502) in AA over 12 months. The substantial proportion of stable/improved patients (92.4%, N = 464) and large effect sizes in severe stages highlight its potential. However, modest inter-rater reliability underscores the need for refined protocols or potential AI-driven evaluations. Future prospective trials should confirm these findings and explore optimal dosing, patient selection, and long-term durability."

To compare the efficacy and safety of low-dose oral minoxidil (group 1) (G1), topical minoxidil (group 2) (G2), and PRP with topical minoxidil (group 3) (G3) in AGA. Seventy-five participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups (n = 25),. Clinical and videodermoscopic assessments were performed at pre-scheduled intervals over 32 weeks, which was completed by 60 patients. At 32 weeks, 25% of patients in groups 1 and 3, and 10% in group 2 showed one grade improvement in AGA severity (p = 0.62). The median percentage increase in terminal hair density was 47.5 in G1, 48 in G2, and 57 in G3 at week 32 favoring G3 over G1 (p = 0.03) and G2 (p = 0.02). Median percentage decrease in vellus hair density was 26 in G1, 21 in G2, and 19 in G3, favoring G1 over G3 (p = 0.03), All 3 groups demonstrated a significant decrease in hair diameter diversity by 32 weeks, with no intergroup variation. The major side effects noted in G1 were headaches (20%), dizziness (15%), and pedal edema (5%). Scalp itching and dryness was observed in 75% of patients after topical minoxidil. Transient pain was observed in all patients during PRP procedure, along with minimal bleeding and dizziness in 15% and 5% respectively. Side effects experienced in all 3 groups were mild and were tolerated by most of the patients.

This work was to investigate the clinical therapeutic effects of microneedling plus5% Minoxidil and Finasteride in treating male androgenetic alopecia. 45 male patients with androgenetic alopecia were recruited and rolled into control group 1 (Group A) received monotherapy with 5% Minoxidil; control group 2 (Group B) received 5% Minoxidil and Finasteride; and the experimental group (Group C) received combination therapy with microneedling, 5% Minoxidil, and Finasteride. Each group consisted of 15 patients. Comparison was made on trace element levels, testosterone levels, hair microscopy indicators, Norwood Hamilton hair loss (HL) classification, self-rating of hair growth and Ars (ARs). After treatment, the contents of trace elements and hormone levels in the three groups did not change considerably(P > 0.05). After treatment, the ratio of villi to single hair follicle in the three groups decreased markedly. The decline degree of group B and group C was superior to group A (P < 0.05), while that of group C was superior to group B (P > 0.05). After treatment, the hair density and hair shaft diameter of the three groups of patients increased markedly. The increase of group B and group C was superior to group A (P < 0.05), while that of group C was superior to group B (P > 0.05). After treatment, the Norwood-Hamilton alopecia scale in group C was better than that in group A (P < 0.01). A total of 80% patients in group C scored ≥ 3, which was better than the other two groups in general. The incidence of ARs differed slightly among the three groups (P > 0.05). Relative to the use of Minoxidil or combination therapy with Finasteride alone, microneedling combined therapy greatly improved hair loss in patients, promoted new hair growth, and holds clinical value.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the effectiveness of low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) in treating short anagen hair syndrome (SAS), a rare congenital condition characterized by a shortened anagen phase. While SAS often resolves spontaneously with puberty, treatment remains controversial. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) in treating various hair loss conditions, including SAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This report presents a case of a 24-year-old female with SAS who experienced significant improvement following LDOM treatment. The patient, who had persistent hair growth issues since childhood, had tried several therapies, including topical 5% minoxidil with limited success. The patient was started on LDOM at 1.25 mg and increased to 2.5 mg after one month. RESULTS: After starting LDOM, the patient reported reduced hair shedding, increased hair length, and improved hair density, which was also confirmed by Canfield's HairMetrix measurements. Despite experiencing mild facial hypertrichosis, the patient opted to continue the treatment. CONCLUSION: This case adds to the growing body of evidence supporting LDOM as a viable treatment for adult SAS. The findings may also offer insights into the genetic basis of SAS and its overlap with other hair loss conditions, suggesting possible shared therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Hair loss disorders negatively impact quality of life. Topical and oral minoxidil are hair loss therapeutics that require daily use to achieve sustained benefits. Patients on topical minoxidil often report aesthetic and discomfort concerns (eg, greasy hair), which may limit adherence. Oral minoxidil is not FDA-approved for alopecia and carries a higher risk of systemic side effects. Efficacy between the 2 is similar. However, the impact of the route of administration on patient adherence and satisfaction remains unclear. Our study investigates whether topical or oral minoxidil yields greater adherence and satisfaction while comparing side effects. A survey was distributed to patients on minoxidil (n=50, response rate 98.0%) to assess ease of treatment, adherence, satisfaction, and side effects. Patients on oral minoxidil reported greater ease of treatment (P=0.0004) and styling their hair on treatment (P=0.0112). Fewer patients on oral minoxidil stopped treatment due to difficulty of use (0% vs 18.8%, P=0.0076). Oral patients missed less treatment days (x=0.15 vs x=1.2, P=0.0022) and reported greater satisfaction in hair volume (P=0.0098) and change of hair (P=0.0159). Side effects were similar, except for a higher incidence of hypertrichosis among patients on oral minoxidil (48.5% vs 6.25%, P=0.0015). These findings suggest that oral minoxidil is superior to topical in terms of ease of use, adherence, and satisfaction without increasing systemic side effects. By circumventing scalp application, oral minoxidil reduces the treatment burden and avoids the aesthetic and discomfort complaints that limit adherence. When establishing treatment plans, physicians should consider patient experience and its impact on adherence. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(2):131-133. doi:10.36849/JDD.8424.",

To evaluate the effect of oral minoxidil on the growth rate of hair and nails. An open study was conducted involving 10 healthy adult men (21 to 46 years old), who underwent treatment with minoxidil 1 mg/day, followed by 2.5 mg/day for 14 days. Hair evaluation was conducted within 48 hours after shaving a standard retro auricular area. Nails were evaluated after 14 days, and the length between the thumbnail lunula and markings on the nail plate were measured. Hair and nail growth rate assessments were performed through dermoscopic photographs and measured in pixels using ImageJ software. Blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated during visits (D-14, D0, D14, and D28). Significance was set at p value <0.05, one-tailed. Minoxidil 2.5 mg, but not 1 mg, increased nail growth speed by 50.7% (p<0.01). Minoxidil 1 mg and 2.5 mg increased hair growth speed by 16.5% and 35.9% (p<0.01), respectively. Heart rate increased by 9.7% and 16.7% with 1 mg and 2.5 mg (p<0.01), respectively, but there was no change in blood pressure (p>0.2), and other symptoms were not reported during the study.

Due to an apparent paucity of the condition, limited research exists, and causes are as yet undetermined. What is known, is that the condition may either be a feature of several syndromes or occur as a consequence of a number of diseases or drugs that produce changes in scalp structure, particularly acromegaly, and theoretically, the use of growth hormone (GH) itself or the use of drugs that mimic the effect of GH (secretagogues). CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of CVG that resulted from long-term topical use of minoxidil at a high concentration. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Minoxidil has been shown to be able to potentiate the mitogenic effects of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). Meanwhile, the striking manifestations of acromegaly are due to excessive IGF-1 production by the liver in response to GH stimulation. The growth-promoting properties of IGF-1 trigger soft tissue hypertrophy, and hypertrichosis. Pseudoacromegaly has been reported to be induced by the long-term use of oral minoxidil. This is the first case report of secondary CVG from the use of topical minoxidil for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia."

RESULTS: The side-effects/symptoms observed in the assessed patients included body and facial hypertrichosis (most incidents), lower legs edema, periorbital edema, fatigue, tachycardia, and insomnia. Dizziness, hypotension, respiratory changes, and diarrhea were expected although not found in the assessed participants. No life-threatening adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: The doses administered in current research of oral minoxidil presented good safety profile as hair loss treatment, with the most incident side-effect being related to hypertrichosis. Systemic side-effects were infrequent."

Although studies have reported that some medications can improve the symptoms of hair loss in HSS, there is still a lack of definitive and effective treatments for this disease. We report a familial case of HSS in an 8-year-old male child diagnosed with HSS caused by a mutation in CDSN, who was treated with botanical extracts in combination with minoxidil, which resulted in significant hair growth after two treatments. This is the first study describing the improvement of clinical symptoms of HSS with oral botanical extracts. This suggests that botanical extracts in combination with minoxidil may be a therapeutic approach for HSS in the clinic."

This study conducts a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the efficacy and side effect profiles of pharmacological treatments for AF, including diltiazem (DTZ), glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), nifedipine (ND), minoxidil (MD), and lidocaine (LC). METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, a systematic review and NMA were performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non-surgical treatments for AF were sourced from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Medline. The primary outcome was AF healing, with secondary outcomes including recurrence rates, pain reduction (visual analog scale), and adverse effects. Statistical analysis utilized odds ratios and surface under the cumulative ranking values for treatment ranking. RESULTS: Twenty-two RCTs involving a total of 1770 participants were included in the analysis. ND demonstrated the highest healing rate, followed by DTZ and MD. LC exhibited the lowest healing rate. DTZ had the lowest recurrence rate and was the most effective in pain reduction, whereas LC had the highest recurrence rate and was the least effective in alleviating pain. The incidence of adverse effects with MD was relatively low, second only to LC, while GTN had the highest rate of adverse effects. CONCLUSION: ND had the highest healing rate and should be considered as a first-line non-surgical treatment for AFs. Given the elevated incidence of adverse reactions associated with nitroglycerin, its use should be avoided in order to minimize the risk of significant toxicities and side effects. Additionally, because of its outstanding analgesic properties, DTZ is recommended as the preferred option for patients with heightened sensitivity to pain, but more studies are needed to evaluate its efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Androgenic alopecia (AGA), the most prevalent type of progressive hair loss, currently lacks an effective topical treatment regimen. In this study, we synthesized an ionic liquid (IL) to co-solubilize minoxidil (MXD) and finasteride (FIN) and subsequently formulated them into an in situ thermosensitive ionic liquid/cyclodextrin/poloxamer hydrogel (ICPG), termed M + F@ICPG. M + F@ICPG was developed for the transdermal co-delivery of these two drugs, aiming to provide a multipath therapeutic approach for AGA while avoiding the adverse effects commonly associated with oral FIN and topical MXD tincture. The thermosensitive characteristics, skin penetration, hair follicle (HF) targeting efficiency, biosafety, and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of M + F@ICPG were evaluated using an AGA mouse model. Our results demonstrated that M + F@ICPG was a thermosensitive hydrogel, transitioning from solution to gel upon contact with the scalp. Compared to the FIN suspension and MXD tincture, M + F@ICPG significantly enhanced the skin penetration (∼2.2-fold) and retention (∼8.6-fold) of FIN and increased the relative retention of MXD (∼6.3-fold) in the skin. Moreover, M + F@ICPG exhibited a HF targeting index of 1.74 for MXD and 1.46 for FIN, indicating enhanced drug targeting to HF. M + F@ICPG showed superior in vivo efficacy in terms of hair regeneration, anagen recovery, inflammation mitigation, and microvessel reconstruction. The underlying mechanism was attributed to the upregulation of hair growth genes, downregulation of hair loss genes, and reduction of abnormally elevated inflammatory factors. These findings suggest that this novel M + F@ICPG is a promising topical co-delivery system for the synergistic treatment of AGA.",

      "abstract": "Compounding medications in pharmacies is a common practice for patients with prescriptions that are not available commercially, but it is a laborious and error-prone task. The incorporation of emerging technologies to prepare personalised medication, such as 3D printing, has been delayed in smaller pharmacies due to concerns about potential workflow disruptions and learning curves associated with novel technologies. This study examines the use in a community pharmacy of a pharmaceutical 3D printer to auto-fill capsules and blisters using semisolid extrusion, incorporating an integrated quality control system. This retains the customisation and automation advantages of 3D printing, speeding up the manufacturing process while increasing familiarity for pharmacists. Minoxidil capsules (2.5 mg and 5 mg doses) were prepared using a pharmaceutical 3D printer and dispensed to 9 patients in a community compounding pharmacy setting in Spain. This innovative production method was compared to the conventional manual capsule filling. All capsules met the European Pharmacopeia standards for mass uniformity, drug content and dissolution, and demonstrated stability at 25 °C and 65 % relative humidity for three months, matching the typical treatment duration. The 3D printer offers greater precision and efficiency and reduced operator involvement by more than half compared to manual capsule filling, making the process faster and more cost-effective. This study offers for the first time a clear roadmap for implementing a pharmaceutical 3D printer in a community pharmacy for automated compounding to prepare reliable and precise personalised medication for patients, marking a valuable step forward in precision medicine.",

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate further the compatibility of ready-to-use vehicles for the preparation of tailored formulations for alopecia treatment, namely TrichoSol™ (a ready-to-use vehicle for personalized hair solutions) and TrichoFoam™ (a ready-to-use vehicle for personalized foam formulations), in combination with minoxidil and other active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), to establish adequate beyond-use dates (BUD) for the given formulations. METHODS: Products under evaluation were compounded using TrichoSol™ or TrichoFoam™, with direct incorporation of the APIs into these vehicles. Samples were then stored at controlled room temperature for up to 180 days. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed and validated, and then utilized to evaluate the compatibility of the APIs in TrichoSol™ and TrichoFoam™. Forced degradation studies were conducted to assess API stability under various stress conditions, and Antimicrobial Effectiveness Testing (AET) was performed at 0 and 180 days after compounding. RESULTS: According to our results, BUDs of up to 90-180 days were obtained for the examined formulations stored at room temperature, considering a degradation of maximum 10% of the nominal concentration of the APIs within them. The formulations exhibited no discernible physical alterations throughout this period and maintained chemical stability within acceptable limits. Microbiological evaluations confirmed the efficacy of the preservative system. CONCLUSION: Products compounded with TrichoSol™ and TrichoFoam™ showed suitable stability to be used as personalized treatments for alopecia. We can then suggest that the vehicles TrichoSol™ and TrichoFoam™ present effective solutions for compounding personalized hair care treatments."

Randomized clinical trials comparing minoxidil monotherapy with minoxidil and LLLT combination therapy were included based on predefined criteria. The Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2.0) tool was used for quality assessment. RESULTS: From 38 identified studies, 34 remained after excluding 4 duplicates. Further exclusions left 4 eligible studies comparing minoxidil alone with minoxidil and LLLT. The meta-analysis found no statistically significant differences in hair counts between the two groups at baseline, 12 weeks, and 8 weeks post-treatment [mean difference = -0.04, 95% CI -1.22 to 1.14, p = .95, I² = 0%]. Similarly, hair diameter showed no significant differences at the same time points [mean difference = 0.00, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.00, p = .98, I² = 38%].

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the hair follicles and sometimes the nails. It usually presents as a single or multiple patches of hair loss on the scalp, but any hair-bearing skin can be involved. AA treatment depends on the severity and extent of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of combined fractional CO2 (FCO2) laser with topical minoxidil 5% solution versus topical minoxidil 5% solution alone in the treatment of AA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 150 patients with AA. The patients were collected from outpatient clinics of the Dermatology and Venerology Department, Tanta University Hospitals. Patients were divided into three groups; 60 patients were treated with topical minoxidil 5% solution, 60 patients were treated with FCO2 laser combined with topical minoxidil 5% solution, and the third group of 30 patients represented the control group treated with topical saline. RESULTS: Compared to the placebo group, there was a statistically significant improvement in hair growth in the combination group and minoxidil group. In the combination group, 80% of patients showed excellent improvement, 13.3% of patients showed very good improvement, and 6.7% of patients showed good improvement. In the minoxidil group, 53% of patients showed excellent improvement, 40% of patients showed very good improvement, and 6.7% of patients showed good improvement after 3 months of therapy. Side effects were minimal and transient in both groups. CONCLUSION: Topical minoxidil 5% solution either alone or in combination with FCO2 laser could be considered a safe and tolerable method for AA treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The histological hallmark of male androgenetic alopecia (MAGA) is transformation of terminal follicles into miniaturized secondary-vellus follicles. As the volume of the dermal papilla determines the size of the hair bulb and hair fibre diameter, any treatment induced increase in fibre diameter could be used as a proxy for reversal of hair follicle miniaturization. While clinical trials with minoxidil topical solution in MAGA do not demonstrate increased fibre diameter, vellus-to-terminal reconversion is shown in a humanized mouse model treated with MXL. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether low-dose, sub-lingual minoxidil (SLM) increases hair fibre diameter in MAGA. METHOD: Serial, tattoo-localized phototrichograms were analyzed using hair-to-hair (H2H) matching software in 33 patients with MAGA who participated in a 24-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, clinical trial with SLM 0.45mg once daily. Additional data was obtained from 12 participants who had used placebo and then rolled into 6 months, open-label, extension study with either once daily 1.35mg or 4.05mg SLM.TrichoLAB® H2H analysis uniquely identified individual hairs and measured hair fibre diameter at baseline and 24 weeks. RESULTS: After 24 weeks, fibre diameter decreased by 2±1µm (1σ CL) in men receiving placebo. The decrease was most marked in intermediate diameter fibres with a baseline diameter of 40-60µm.Among men receiving SLM 0.45mg, 1.35mg and 4.05 mg, the change in mean fibre diameter was: 2±1µm, 3±1µm, 6±1µm (1σ CL) respectively. Intermediate thickness fibres enlarged most.H2H matching demonstrated increased diameter in individual fibres. CONCLUSION: The effect of SLM on mean fibre diameter was dose-dependent. SLM 1.35mg and 4.05mg, but not 0.45mg, significantly increased mean fibre diameter in MAGA. Diameter increased most in intermediate and thickest hairs. This increase in fibre diameter infers reversal of follicle miniaturization in MAGA and is consistent with the observation of vellus-to-terminal reconversion is shown in a humanized mouse model treated with minoxidil."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Minoxidil, in addition to its vasodilatory effect, has also immunomodulatory properties that may be partially responsible for its efficacy in alopecia areata. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of monotherapy with topical or oral minoxidil in alopecia areata. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of monotherapy with minoxidil in alopecia areata was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Efficacy of minoxidil in alopecia areata was evaluated separately for three groups of the patients: (1) treated with 5% topical minoxidil, (2) less than 5% topical minoxidil, and (3) oral minoxidil. Therapeutic response was defined as any regrowth of terminal hair. Results: Of 244 articles, 13 were considered eligible for the further analysis. The study included 372 patients with alopecia areata (338 using topical minoxidil and 34 taking oral minoxidil). The mean time of treatment ranged from 2 to 60 weeks (mean: 27 weeks). The response rate for 5% topical was 82% (95% CI 0.7-0.93) and 58% (95% Cl 0.5-0.67) for the less than 5% topical minoxidil group. For the group of patients treated orally, the response rate was 82%. Conclusions: Minoxidil, both topical and oral, may be beneficial in monotherapy in patients with alopecia areata. 5% topical minoxidil is characterized by significantly higher efficacy compared to minoxidil at a lower concentration. There are no sufficient data to recommend minoxidil as a first-line therapeutic option for alopecia areata."

In this context, minoxidil, a vasodilator drug widely used in the treatment of androgenic alopecia, has been scarcely investigated in plant systems. Therefore, this study evaluated the morphological and cytotoxic effects of minoxidil on Phaseolus vulgaris L as a bioindicator. P. vulgaris seeds were exposed to different concentrations of minoxidil (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/L) and parameters such as germination, root growth, mitotic index and frequency of chromosomal abnormalities were assessed. The results showed a significant inhibition of germination (75-76%) and root growth (52.6-55.3%) at high concentrations of minoxidil (2.55 mg/L-5 mg/L). In addition, a decrease in the mitotic index (8.2) and an increase in the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities (10.2) were observed, suggesting a cytotoxic effect. These findings show that minoxidil, even at low concentrations, can have adverse effects on the morphology and cell division of P. vulgaris. This study demonstrates the potential of plants as tools to evaluate the phytotoxicity and cytotoxicity of drugs and highlights the need to implement measures to reduce the contamination of these drugs in the environment.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we attempted to enhance the delivery of minoxidil (MXD) nanocrystals into hair follicles for efficacious hair growth treatment. We applied a bead milling method and designed an MXD nanocrystal dispersion containing methylcellulose (MC) and gum arabic (GA), termed MG-MXD@NP, with a particle size of 110 nm. In vivo studies in C57BL/6 mice showed that MG-MXD@NP improved MXD delivery to the skin tissue, hair bulges, and hair bulbs, resulting in earlier and superior hair growth compared with a commercially available MXD lotion (Riup 5%, CA-MXD). These findings were consistent with the increased MXD contents observed in the hair bulge and hair bulb regions in the MG-MXD@NP-treated mice, and suggested a correlation between the efficiency of MXD delivery and efficacy of promotion of hair growth by products containing MXD. Furthermore, delivery of MXD using MG-MXD@NP was associated with elevated expression levels of CD34 and CD200, markers of hair follicle epithelial stem cells, which are crucial for promoting hair growth. Thus, it is possible that the upregulation of CD34 and CD200 in the MG-MXD@NP-treated mice reflects activation of the papilla cells and hair follicle stem cells known to be closely associated with hair growth enhancement. In conclusion, MG-MXD@NP, containing MXD nanocrystals in combination with MC and GA, exhibited a superior hair growth effect as compared with conventional MXD formulations. These findings suggest that this novel delivery method for MXD could represent a promising treatment approach for hair loss.",

      "abstract": "Minoxidil is a vasodilator medication known for its ability to promote hair growth. Although it was first introduced as an oral drug to treat hypertension, minoxidil was observed to have the important side-effect of increasing hair growth. This led to the development of a topical formulation as a 2% concentration solution for the treatment of female androgenic alopecia (AGA) and 5% for treating male AGA, which is considered as a first line U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for AGA in addition to oral 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride). The mechanism by which minoxidil promotes hair growth is not fully understood but can be related to increasing blood flow owing to its vasodilator effects. Androgenic alopecia is characterized by the gradual conversion of terminal hairs into vellus hairs. Alterations in the hair cycle include reduced duration of the anagen phase and increased duration of the telogen phase, resulting in shorter hairs and eventual balding. Side effects of topical minoxidil include irritant and allergic contact dermatitis, pruritus, and facial hypertrichosis, which are more often seen with the use of 5% solutions rather than 2%. Herein, we report a 24-year-old woman who developed severe ear and face hypertrichosis after using a topical 5% minoxidil solution. She later had spontaneous resolution of her hypertrichosis three months after stopping it.",

Although topical and oral minoxidil is widely established for treating hair loss by dermatologists, there is a lack of a comprehensive review regarding the use of injectable minoxidil. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to elucidate the clinical efficacy and safety of injectable minoxidil in treating the specific hair loss diagnoses of androgenetic alopecia and alopecia areata. This review performs individual and comparative analyses of both disorders in populations of all age groups and genders. RESULTS: Two-hundred eighty-six (286) articles originated from both screens. Among these, 11 articles with 19,192 patients were included, encompassing 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 uncontrolled clinical trial (CT), 2 retrospective studies, and 3 case reports. Studies on androgenetic alopecia reported significant improvement in hair growth (P&gt;0.05) after receiving treatment with injectable minoxidil. In comparison, studies on alopecia areata demonstrated case-by-case outcomes, with two out of four studies reporting significant improvement. The primary side effects reported were hypotension and pain. Insufficient high-quality studies are available to analyze the use of injectable minoxidil for scarring hair loss. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review demonstrates injectable minoxidil is an efficacious and safe treatment for androgenetic alopecia, with variable efficacy and safety for treating alopecia areata. Injectable minoxidil is a promising primary and adjunctive therapy for treating androgenetic alopecia clinically. Further translational research should explore how the pharmacokinetic and bioavailability of injectable minoxidil translates to clinical efficacy to establish the optimal dosing.

METHODS: The study was conducted on a selected group of 92 men aged between 20 and 50 years. The patients were divided into three groups, each with a different therapeutic algorithm: group A - three microneedling treatments 1 month apart, group B - three microneedling treatments 1 month apart and daily topical application of 5% minoxidil, group C - three platelet-rich plasma treatments 1 month apart. RESULTS: Each group showed an increase in mean hair number and density. However, only group C demonstrated a statistically significant increase in hair shaft thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is no clear consensus in the literature regarding algorithms for microneedling and platelet-rich plasma treatment of the scalp. For the study, we selected a minimum effective algorithm that yielded satisfactory results."

Microneedling, a minimally invasive technique can enhance hair growth by releasing growth factors. However, no standardized protocol for frequency, depth and duration is available. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of the combination therapy of microneedling and minoxidil in AGA. This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted over 12 weeks. The intervention group received a 4-weekly combination therapy of microneedling + 5% minoxidil, while the control group got only topical 5% minoxidil. Hair density and diameter were assessed using FotoFinder® trichoscale (Fotofinder Systems GmBH, Bad Birnbach, Germany) every 4 weeks. A total of 36 male participants, between 26-51 years old, with Hamilton-Norwood type III-VI AGA were included. At the end of the study, the intervention group had significantly higher hair density (95.6 vs 52.4 hair/cm², p<0.001) and diameter (18 vs 6 μm, p=0.004) than the control group. Side effects, included itching and transient erythema, were well tolerated. The combination of 4-weekly microneedling and topical 5% minoxidil is effective in increasing both hair density and hair diameter, and safe to use in AGA patients."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The results of small studies suggest that off-label use of low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) may be safe and effective for patients with hair loss, but larger trials and standardized guidelines are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To create an expert consensus statement for LDOM prescribing for patients with hair loss. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The current literature on the pharmacological properties, adverse effect profile, and use of LDOM for patients with hair loss was reviewed. Topics of interest were identified, and a modified Delphi consensus process was created. A total of 43 hair loss specialist dermatologists from 12 countries participated in a modified Delphi process. Consensus was reached if at least 70% agreed or strongly agreed on a 5-point Likert scale. FINDINGS: Over 4 survey rounds, 180 items in the first round, 121 items in the second round, 16 items in the third round, and 11 items in the fourth round were considered and revised. A total of 76 items achieved consensus including diagnoses for which LDOM may provide direct or supportive benefit, indications for LDOM compared to topical minoxidil, dosing for adults (18 years and older) and adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years), contraindications, precautions, baseline evaluation, monitoring, adjunctive therapy, and specialty consultation. Pediatric use and dosing items for children younger than 12 years, and LDOM titration protocols fell short of consensus. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This international expert consensus statement regarding the off-label prescribing of LDOM for patients with hair loss can help guide clinical practice until more data emerge. Hair loss experts with experience treating pediatric patients were underrepresented on this expert panel. Future research should investigate best practices for LDOM use in pediatric patients. Other critical topics for further investigation include the comparative efficacy of topical minoxidil vs oral minoxidil, the safety of oral minoxidil for patients with a history of allergic contact dermatitis to topical minoxidil, the long-term safety of LDOM, and the use of other off-label forms of minoxidil, such as compounded formulations of oral minoxidil and sublingual minoxidil. As additional evidence-based data emerge, these recommendations should be updated.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Androgenic alopecia (AGA), a hair loss condition caused by dihydrotestosterone binding to hair follicle receptors, negatively impacts quality of life for both men and women. Current treatments like minoxidil and finasteride have limitations, highlighting the need for alternative therapies, such as human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUCB-MSCs). METHODS: In this study, forty-eight adult male Wistar albino rats (3 months old) were used. The control group (Group I) received no treatment, while the other rats underwent AGA induction via daily subcutaneous testosterone injections (100 mg/kg). These rats developed alopecia and were divided into three groups: AGA (Group II), AGA plus daily minoxidil spray (Group III), and AGA plus a single intradermal injection of HUCB-MSCs (1 mL containing 1 × 105 cells, Group IV). After 4 weeks, the rats were sacrificed, and skin specimens were prepared for histological analysis using H&amp;E, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining for CK 19, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and TUNEL antibodies. RESULTS: It was shown that HUCB-MSC treatment reversed structural damage to hair and follicles, normalizing conditions within 1-week post-injection. The treatment enhanced the anagen phase, suppressed telogen and catagen phases, reduced apoptosis, and increased VEGF and CK 19 immune reactions. Observational follow-up for Groups III and IV revealed that while the minoxidil group experienced significant hair loss after 37 days, the stem cell group exhibited dense and long hair covering the treated area. CONCLUSION: HUCB-MSC therapy demonstrated superior efficacy over minoxidil with no observed side effects, indicating its potential as a promising alternative for AGA treatment."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Minoxidil, traditionally used as an antihypertensive, is now widely used for treating various forms of alopecia due to its vasodilatory effects. While topical minoxidil has been the standard treatment, low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) is emerging as an effective alternative. This study investigates LDOM's potential hypotensive effects. METHODS: Studies were selected based on criteria such as the use of LDOM (≤5 mg/day) and reporting on blood pressure changes. Mean differences (MDs) were calculated for mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate. RESULTS: LDOM did not significantly alter systolic blood pressure (MD: -0.13, 95% CI: -2.67-2.41) or diastolic blood pressure (MD: -1.25, 95% CI: -3.21-0.71). Though MAP was not significantly altered, there was a strong tendency toward decreased MAP (MD: -1.92, 95% CI: -4.00-0.17). There was a significant increase in heart rate (MD: 2.67, 95% CI: 0.34-5.01). Hypotensive symptoms were reported in 119 patients (5.0%), but no hypotensive episodes were observed. Hypertrichosis was the most frequent side effect, leading to 34.6% of discontinuations. LIMITATIONS: Studies lacked control groups and showed variability in dosing regimens and blood pressure monitoring. CONCLUSION: LDOM appears to be a safe treatment for alopecia with no significant impact on blood pressure.",

METHODS: A total of 164 male patients aged between 30 and 60 years, presenting with androgenic alopecia of more than 2 months duration, were included in this single-blind study conducted at the Department of Dermatology, JPMC, Karachi. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: Group A (topical finasteride 0.25% with minoxidil 5%) and Group B (topical minoxidil 5% alone). Patients were followed up for 12 weeks, and hair regrowth was assessed at each visit. RESULTS: The mean age in Group A was 33.99&plusmn;5.97 years, and in Group B, it was 33.91&plusmn;5.71 years. At baseline, the mean salt score was 1.8&plusmn;0.7 in both groups. The efficacy of the treatment was significantly higher in Group A (86.7%) compared to Group B (69.1%; P=0.006). CONCLUSION: The combination of topical finasteride 0.25% with minoxidil 5% provides superior efficacy in the treatment of male pattern androgenic alopecia compared to topical minoxidil 5% alone.

Physical examination revealed rapid shallow breathing, pale mucous membranes, hypothermia, tachycardia, and hypotension. Thoracic radiography revealed mild pulmonary infiltration and pleural effusion. Despite conservative treatment, including oxygen therapy, and intravenous fluid, furosemide, and dopamine administration, the patient showed no improvement. After two sessions of intermittent hemodialysis, the cat's respiratory pattern and overall condition gradually improved; normal body temperature and blood pressure were achieved. The cat recovered fully and was discharged on the 11th day of hospitalization. This is the first report on the use of hemodialysis in the treatment of a cat with minoxidil toxicosis."

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the use of oral minoxidil and minoxidil topical solution in patients with AGA. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio 4.3.2. Standard mean difference (SMD) and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled across trials. This meta-analysis included four RCTs reporting data on 279 patients. Follow-up ranged from 24 to 39 weeks.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is common and has a negative impact on quality of life. FPHL is more challenging to treat than male pattern hair loss, with minoxidil being the gold standard treatment. Several studies have used 17α-estradiol solution for treating FPHL with variable results, either alone or combined with minoxidil. OBJECTIVES: To study the safety and efficacy of topical 17α-ethinylestradiol 0.01% combined with minoxidil 2% in comparison with minoxidil 2% in the treatment of FPHL. METHODS: Forty-three women with FPHL were recruited to this randomized controlled study and were asked to blindly apply twice daily six puffs of a spray-on solution containing either 17α-ethinylestradiol 0.01% combined with minoxidil 2% (EMX group) or minoxidil 2% alone (MX group). Treatment continued for 6 months. Clinical and trichoscopic assessments were performed at baseline and at the end of the treatment. RESULTS: At the end of the treatment period, both groups showed signs of improvement. Improvement parameters were better for the EMX group vs. the MX group, but this was not statistically significant. More patients in the EMX group experienced menstrual irregularities. Limitations include the limited number of patients and follow-up period. Also, the effects of estradiol were not studied on a cellular or molecular levels and systemic absorption of both medications was not determined. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a 0.01% 17α-ethinylestradiol with a 2% minoxidil solution in the treatment of FPHL does not seem to offer a statistically significant advantage compared with minoxidil alone and may carry a higher risk of associated menstrual irregularities.",

Blue-emitting sulfur and nitrogen co-doped carbon quantum dots (S,N-CQDs) were generated by exposing soluble starch and thiourea to a 15-minute microwave treatment. The so- prepared nanodots displayed fluorescence at 276/430 nm with a quantum yield of 22 %. Inspection of the so-prepared nano-sensor verified their doping with nitrogen and sulfur, and their size was in the range of 4.5-9.03 nm. The proposed method was found to be rectilinear in the range of 0.20-5.0 and 2.0-30.0 µg/mL, with LOQs of 0.16 and 0.82 µg/mL for minoxidil and timolol, respectively. The developed method was employed to assess the concentrations of minoxidil and timolol in their pharmaceutical formulations, with %recoveries varying between 99.00 % and 101.94 %, and low RSD values (less than 2 %). The high sensitivity of the developed method allowed its use for timolol measurement in artificial aqueous humor, with % recoveries between 97.60 %.and 101.57 %. The study further examined how each analyte interacted with the prepared dots, leading to a quenching of their fluorescence. Additionally, an interference study was utilized to evaluate the specificity of the proposed approach through determining analyte levels in the existence of common additives, co-formulated drugs, and co-administered drugs. The analytical eco-scale, GAPI and AGREE assessment techniques were utilized to confirm the suggested method greenness.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether LDOM is associated with increased prevalence of pericardial effusions in patients with alopecia. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, point-of-care ultrasound was used to screen alopecia patients at dermatology appointments. Scans were evaluated by two independent cardiologists for the presence and size of effusions. The prevalence of effusions was compared between patients on LDOM therapy and patients not on minoxidil therapy. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were evaluated for pericardial effusion: 51 LDOM patients and 49 control patients. The two groups were similar in terms of age (53.7 vs 54.1; P=0.91), sex (86% vs 73% female; P=0.14), and race. Small pericardial effusions (&lt;1 cm) were identified in 5.8% of LDOM patients and 6% of control patients (P=1), none of which were symptomatic. LIMITATIONS: This is a small, cross-sectional study with limitations on speculation of causality in confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence of increased prevalence of pericardial effusions in a small group of alopecia patients on LDOM. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(9):725-728. doi:10.36849/JDD.8029.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune skin disease. Our study aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of compound glycyrrhizin (CG) combined with topical minoxidil therapy in treating AA. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone for AA were included. The Cochrane Collaborative Network Tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Statistical analysis was completed using RevMan5.3 software and Stata 15.0 software. The GRADE system was used to evaluate the quality of evidence for outcomes. RESULT: 11 RCTs and 1189 patients were included. Compared with topical minoxidil therapy alone, CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy was more effective at improving the clinical efficacy (RR = 1.36, 95% CI [1.27, 1.45], p < 0.00001). The SALT score (MD = -10.09, 95% CI [-12.89, -7.30], p < 0.00001), serum TNF-α levels (MD = -0.99, 95% CI [-1.19, -0.39], p < 0.00001), serum IL-12 levels (MD = -8.84, 95% CI [-11.20, -6.47], p < 0.00001) and serum IFN-γ levels (MD = -7.44, 95% CI [-11.51, -3.37], p = 0.0003) were reduced, and the serum TGF-β1 levels (MD = 2.40, 95% CI [1.24, 3.57], p < 0.0001) were increased. There were no significant differences in reported adverse events, including irritant contact dermatitis (RR = 0.51, 95% CI [0.25, 1.01], p = 0.05),' gastrointestinal reactions (RR = 2.47, 95% CI [0.49, 12.55], p = 0.28), lower limb edema (RR = 2.60, 95% CI [0.61, 11.06], p = 0.20), facial edema (RR = 2.33, 95% CI [0.61, 8.93], p = 0.22), or localized itching (RR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.18, 1.75], p = 0.32), between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The current evidence indicates that CG combined with topical minoxidil therapy is effective and safe for AA. However, owing to the suboptimal quality of the included studies, more high-quality and large-scale RCTs are needed for comprehensive analysis and further validation.",

It possesses several serious side effects including fluid retention, worsening of heart failure, reflex tachycardia, angina, myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion, and hypotension. It is currently reserved for treating alopecia and readily available over the counter as a topical formulation. Intentional/accidental ingestion of topical minoxidil can cause refractory circulatory shock requiring aggressive hydration and vasopressor support. We present a case of a young female with unintentional ingestion of minoxidil leading to severe circulatory shock and acute pulmonary edema. Minoxidil, a common hair loss treatment, is highly dangerous if ingested. Immediate identification and treatment are crucial, involving fluid resuscitation and vasopressors for severe circulatory shock. Midodrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, can reduce ICU stay by shortening IV vasopressor usage."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: It still needs to be determined if platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has any added advantage over Minoxidil in treating androgenetic alopecia. We reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing scalp injections of PRP plus Minoxidil vs Minoxidil alone for managing androgenetic alopecia. METHODS: All RCTs published on Embase, Cochrane Library, and PubMed comparing PRP plus Minoxidil vs. Minoxidil alone were eligible. The literature search was completed on 5 March 2024. The review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024509826). RESULTS: Of five included RCTs, three had a high risk of bias, while one had some concerns. A systematic review of the studies showed that all trials reported better outcomes with PRP plus Minoxidil than with Minoxidil alone. Meta-analysis showed that hair density at one month (MD: 11.07 95% CI: 1.20, 20.94 I2 = 0%), three months (MD: 21.81 95% CI: 10.64, 33.00 I2 = 57%) and 5/6 months (MD: 17.80 95% CI: 7.91, 27.69 I2 = 80%) of follow-up was significantly better in the PRP plus Minoxidil vs the Minoxidil alone group. Meta-analysis of adverse events showed that the risk of adverse events was comparable in both groups (OR: 0.55 95% CI: 0.22, 1.36 I2 = 0%). The certainty of evidence on the GRADE assessment was \"low to very low.\" CONCLUSION: Very low-quality evidence shows that the addition of injectable PRP to topical Minoxidil may improve outcomes in patients with androgenetic alopecia. The addition of PRP was found to improve hair density and patient satisfaction significantly. However, the small number of studies with a high risk of bias and heterogeneity in PRP preparation methods are significant limitations of current evidence. Further studies with larger sample sizes and uniform PRP preparation protocols are needed.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A (BTA) combined with Minoxidil in patients with AGA. 60 male patients were included in this study and control group received topical 5% Minoxidil and the treatment group received BTA combined with topical 5% Minoxidil. BTA injections (60-70 U) were administered at 30-35 scalp sites. Head photographs were taken at baseline, 2nd, 4th, and 6th months. Clinical descriptions recorded scalp conditions, and patient satisfaction along with Dermatology Life Quality Index scores were documented. The treatment group (TG) showed significant hair growth differences compared to the control group (CG) at the 4th month (P < 0.001) and 6th month (P = 0.0046) post-treatment. TG had improved Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scores in the 4th month (P = 0.0001) and 6th month (P = 0.0259) compared to CG. Patient satisfaction in TG for hair growth and scalp improvement was higher than CG (all P < 0.05). TG exhibited substantial quality of life improvement at the 4-month (P = 0.0009) and 6-month (P = 0.0099). No adverse reactions were observed post-botulinum toxin injection. BTA combined with Minoxidil effectively promotes hair growth, enhances the quality of life, and alleviates scalp symptoms in male AGA patients at 4th and 6th months, with no adverse effects compared to Minoxidil alone.Trial registration number: Ethics Committee of Shanghai Tongji Hospital (ID: K-2018-026).",

Spironolactone, known for treating hirsutism, is also used off-label for the treatment of certain forms of alopecia and may reduce LDOM-induced hypertrichosis. We performed a retrospective review of 54 patients seen at NYU Langone Health and compared hypertrichosis rates in female alopecia patients on LDOM monotherapy versus those on combination therapy with spironolactone. Among 54 patients, 37 received LDOM alone and 17 received the combination. Hypertrichosis developed in 33.3% of patients, with lower rates in the combination group (17.6% vs. 40.5% for monotherapy). Although not statistically significant, the trend suggests spironolactone may mitigate hypertrichosis. The study highlights the potential of combination therapy to address hypertrichosis and calls for larger studies to confirm these findings.",

This study investigates the effect of oral minoxidil in women with chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy-induced late alopecia. METHODS: The rate of clinical response was assessed by standardized photography and quantitated with trichoscopy. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixteen patients (mean age 57.8 ± 13.7) were included. The most common cancer diagnosis was breast, in 170 patients (79.1%). Alopecia developed after chemotherapy in 31 (14.4%) patients, endocrine monotherapy in 65 (30.1%) patients, and chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy in 120 (55.6%) patients. In 119 patients, standardized photography assessments were used to determine clinical change in alopecia after a median of 105 (IQR = 70) days on oral minoxidil and revealed improvement in 88 (74%) patients. Forty-two patients received quantitative trichoscopic assessments at baseline and at follow-up after a median of 91 (IQR = 126) days on oral minoxidil. Patients had clinically and statistically significant increases in frontal hair shaft density (from 124.2 hairs/cm2 at initial to 153.2 hairs/cm2 at follow-up assessment, p = 0.008) and occipital shaft density (from 100.3 hairs/cm2 at initial to 123.5 hairs/cm2 at follow-up assessment. p = 0.004). No patients discontinued oral minoxidil due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, oral minoxidil was well tolerated by patients and may benefit both frontal and occipital late alopecia in cancer survivors treated with cytotoxic and/or endocrine therapy by increasing hair shaft and follicle density.",

For the purpose of targeting the delivery of MXD to dermal papilla in the hair follicle, MXD Pickering emulsion gels were fabricated based on the designability of deep eutectic solvent (DES) and the versatility of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na). Structural studies and theoretical calculations results suggest that CNC can stabilize the interface between the MXD-DES and water, leading to the formation of Pickering emulsions. The rheological properties and stabilities of MXD Pickering emulsions were enhanced through gelation using CMC-Na, which highlights the good compatibility and effectiveness of natural polysaccharides in emulsion gels. Due to the particle size of emulsion droplets (679 nm) and the rheological properties of emulsion gel, the fabricated MXD formulations show in vivo hair regrowth promotion and hair follicle targeting capabilities. Interestingly, the MXD Pickering emulsion-based formulations exert therapeutic effects by upregulating the expression of hair growth factors. The proposed nanodrug strategy based on supramolecular strategies of CNC and CMC-Na provides an interesting avenue for androgenetic alopecia treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is common. While topical minoxidil remains the only FDA-approved therapeutic for AGA, its efficacy is limited in stimulating clinically significant hair regrowth over the longer term. Oral minoxidil, which is used off-label, is a promising alternative; however, its effectiveness and underlying mechanisms warrant further investigation. AIMS: To elucidate the site of action and infer the physiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic responses to oral minoxidil in patients with AGA. METHODS: Forty-one patients with AGA underwent 6 months of low-dose oral minoxidil treatment. Minoxidil sulfotransferase (SULT) activity was assayed in plucked scalp hair follicles. The primary outcome was hair growth after low-dose oral minoxidil treatment for a minimum of 6 months, and the secondary outcome was SULT activity in hair follicles. RESULTS: After 6 months of treatment, 26 (63.4%) patients experienced a clinical improvement in alopecia symptoms. The response rate was higher in men (19/26 [73.1%]) than in women (6/15 [40.0%]). Patients with low hair follicle SULT activity demonstrated a higher minoxidil response rate than those with high enzyme activity (85% vs. 43%, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that low SULT activity within the hair follicles is associated with a favorable response to oral minoxidil therapy in patients with AGA. Further elucidation of the underlying mechanisms could significantly improve personalized therapeutic approaches through improved patient selection and the rational design of adjuvant treatments.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A male 6-year-old child was diagnosed with hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia 2 (HED2) caused by GJB6 (p.G11R) mutations. He presented at our clinic with diffuse thinning and fine and brittle hair since birth. Additionally, the child exhibited abnormal development of teeth, fingernails, and toenails. The condition of the child's hair had not improved significantly with age. He was treated with botanical extracts combined with Minoxidil. RESULTS: After one and a half months of treatment, the patient showed remarkable hair growth. CONCLUSIONS: Our team has previously used botanical extracts in combination for the treatment of autosomal recessive wooly hair in children. In the present case, treatment with botanical extract combined with minoxidil was found to be equally efficacious. This case report provides valuable information for future studies on the use of botanical extracts in treating hair loss, as well as a safe and effective potential treatment strategy for children with congenital alopecia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) remains one of the most challenging afflictions encountered in dermatology clinics. It is characterized by an autoimmune-mediated inflammatory process of and around hair follicles, causing reversible, non-scarring hair loss. With the ongoing search for optimal treatment strategies, the potentially positive role of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy as well as minoxidil has been reported in various studies; however, the comparison of the two treatment modalities is largely underexplored. This research aims to compare and assess the effectiveness of intralesional PRP with topical minoxidil therapy in AA to identify efficacious management options amongst the newly described treatment modalities. METHODOLOGY: The research work was conducted over four months and included 40 (31 males and 9 females) patients suffering from alopecia areata. They were divided into Group A, which was administered monthly autologous PRP injections, while Group B was given daily topical 5% minoxidil therapy. In group A, four treatments of PRP were given, each one month apart. While in group B, daily topical minoxidil spray was administered for the same duration. The alopecia areata severity grade was recorded by employing the \"Severity of Alopecia Tool\" (SALT) scoring system. The pre- and post-treatment SALT scores were noted and compared at each monthly visit. RESULTS: The study comprised nine (22.5%) female and 31 (77.5%) male patients. At the beginning of the study and after one month of treatment, the difference in the SALT score was not statistically significant between the two groups, suggesting that both interventions had similar effects during the early stages of the treatment. At two months, a statistically significant difference emerged (p-value 0.037), indicating that a more significant fall in the SALT score was observed with autologous PRP treatment compared to topical minoxidil. After four months, a highly significant difference was noted between the two groups (p-value <0.0001), implying that intralesional PRP therapy led to a far more significant decrease in the SALT score compared to topical minoxidil therapy. CONCLUSION: Monthly intralesional autologous PRP therapy for four months manifests better outcomes in alopecia areata than daily 5% topical minoxidil therapy."

      "abstract": "The current pharmacological management of androgenetic alopecia is inconvenient and requires a discipline that patients find difficult to follow. This reduces compliance with treatment and satisfaction with results. It is important to propose treatment regimens that increase patient compliance and reduce adverse effects. This work describes transdermal delivery of minoxidil partially encapsulated in β-cyclodextrin and assisted by photoacoustic waves. Photoacoustic waves transiently increase the permeability of the skin and allow for the delivery of encapsulated minoxidil. A minoxidil gel formulation was developed and the transdermal delivery was studied in vitro in the presence and absence of photoacoustic waves. A 5-min stimulus with photoacoustic waves generated by light-to-pressure transducers increases minoxidil transdermal delivery flux by approximately 3-fold. The flux of a 1% minoxidil formulation promoted by photoacoustic waves is similar to the passive flux of a 2% minoxidil commercial formulation. Release of minoxidil from β-cyclodextrin increases dermal exposure without increasing peak systemic exposure. This promotes hair growth with fewer treatments and reduced adverse effects. In vivo studies using encapsulated minoxidil and photoacoustic waves yielded 86% hair coat recovery (vs. 29% in the control group) and no changes in the blood pressure.",

      "abstract": "The minimal adverse-effect profile and positive clinical response of low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) have recently caused the drug to gain popularity for the treatment of hair disorders in adults. However, in the pediatric population, hesitancy still surrounds the use of oral minoxidil given the wide profile of potential side effects the drug offers. This review aims to characterize the safety and use of oral minoxidil in children for the treatment of all disorders to equip physicians with ample knowledge when prescribing oral minoxidil in the pediatric population. A total of 41 studies (19 case reports, 10 cohort studies, 7 retrospective chart reviews, and 5 case series) that reported data on 442 pediatric patients for whom oral minoxidil was used for treatment were included. Conditions for which treatment with minoxidil was described were hair disorders (83.9%, 371/442) and hypertension (11.3%, 50/442); accidental usage (4.8%, 21/442) was also noted in the literature and included in this review. This review is broken down by dosage and describes the safety and efficacy of oral minoxidil in pediatric patients aged 0 to 18 years old for the treatment of hair disorders. This review found that LDOM may represent a safe option for the treatment of hair disorders in children. This study also suggests moderate and high doses of oral minoxidil may not be safe for use in children. Additional studies are needed to further understand this drug's efficacy and safety in children."

      "abstract": "Patterned hair loss (PHL) is a severe hair condition that affects both sexes. Mesotherapy is a treatment that involves microinjecting medications and/or vitamins into the middle layer of the skin. Mesotherapy reduces systemic adverse effects by delivering drugs directly to the hair follicle, increasing local bioavailability while lowering systemic exposure. Local side effects and reactions may develop due to mesotherapy. This study systematically evaluated the safety and efficacy of mesotherapy to minoxidil 5%, as well as addressing its limitations, dosing, and technique, with the intent of providing valuable trials and insights for clinicians and patients considering mesotherapy for improved androgenetic alopecia (AGA) outcomes. The literature search carried out by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria yielded 11 relevant studies from an initial pool of 18 articles. These studies covered various aspects of the role of mesotherapy and minoxidil in AGA, including techniques, complications, limitations, and outcomes. In conclusion, available trials and research on mesotherapy and minoxidil demonstrated excellent statistical significance and a high patient satisfaction rate, with the exception of two publications that took into account certain uncommon adverse effects of mesotherapy. However, recent research suggests that a mesotherapy method for alopecia with a low risk of side effects is effective."

METHODOLOGY: The study included all the patients who visited JPMC Karachi during the study period. Permission from the ERB was obtained. The inclusion criteria were any gender and age 10 to 45 years. Topical minoxidil 5% solution was applied twice daily to Group A (six pubs/time), while PRP injections were administered to Group B at baseline and every four weeks for three months. Serial photos and the severity of alopecia tool (SALT) were used to determine the clinical assessment. When comparing the effectiveness between the two groups, a p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. SPSS version 23 was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Mean age was 23.11 ± 8.9 years in 376 patients. PRP and Minoxidil groups had mean SALT scores at three months that were 1.48 and 1.54, respectively. Both treatments were shown to be efficacious. There was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the minoxidil solution and PRP (p = 0.483). CONCLUSION: There is no apparent difference between PRP and topical minoxidil 5% solution in the management of AA.

This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic response of MMP® (intradermal infiltration) of Minoxidil formulation in the frontal-parietal-vertex regions compared with the gold-standard home administration of Minoxidil 5% Capillary Solution. This self-controlled comparative study evaluated 16 FPHL patients, without treatment for at least 6 months, confirmed by trichoscopy with TrichoLAB® software. They received 4 monthly sessions of MMP® with Minoxidil 0,5% on the right side of the scalp (frontal-parietal-vertex areas), followed by occlusion with plastic film for 12 h and prescription of Minoxidil 5% Solution for home use once a day, on both scalp sides, starting 72 h after the procedure. The reassessment trichoscopy was 6 weeks after the last session and they answered a \"self-assessment\" questionnaire. Treated scalp areas were compared and showed both treatments, in general, were effective, with no difference between them. If they were analyzed separately by treated areas, there were signs of better response in the parietal-vertex regions with treatment by MMP® with Minoxidil, while clinical treatment indicated a better response in the other regions. When patients were divided into more and less advanced cases, a better response in parietal-vertex regions treated by MMP® with Minoxidil in less advanced patients was confirmed. MMP® with Minoxidil showed a better response in the parietal-vertex regions in less advanced FPHL patients.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a prevalent type of hair loss that impacts individuals of both genders. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and minoxidil have been employed as therapeutic interventions for AGA, yet the efficacy of their concurrent use remains ambiguous. OBJECTIVE: To perform a comprehensive review and meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in combination with minoxidil for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (AGA). METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of the databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, encompassing their complete records up until December 2023. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that compared the combination of PRP and minoxidil with minoxidil or PRP alone in patients with AGA. The primary outcome measure was the change in hair growth as assessed by the hair density or hair thickness. Secondary outcome measures included patient satisfaction, and global photographic assessment. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies involving 343 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that PRP combined with minoxidil significantly improved hair growth compared to minoxidil or PRP alone. The pooled analysis demonstrated a significant increase in hair density (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 9.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.57-11.70) and hair diameter (WMD = 4.72; 95% CI 3.21-6.23) in the PRP combined with minoxidil group. Moreover, patients receiving PRP combined with minoxidil reported higher satisfaction rates compared to those using minoxidil or PRP alone. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that PRP combined with minoxidil is an effective treatment for AGA, providing significant improvement in hair growth and patient satisfaction.

The murine model recapitulates the heart phenotype and showed collagen accumulation. We first used a cellular model to study gene expression during cardiogenic differentiation of WT and Tbx1-/- mouse embryonic stem cells. Then we used a mouse model of DGS to test whether interfering with collagen accumulation using an inhibitor of lysyl hydroxylase would modify the cardiac phenotype of the mutant. We found that loss of Tbx1 in a precardiac differentiation model was associated with up regulation of a subset of ECM-related genes, including several collagen genes. In the in vivo model, early prenatal treatment with Minoxidil, a lysyl hydroxylase inhibitor, ameliorated the cardiac outflow tract septation phenotype in Tbx1 mutant fetuses, but it had no effect on septation in WT fetuses. We conclude that TBX1 suppresses a defined subset of ECM-related genes. This function is critical for OFT septation because the inhibition of collagen cross-linking in the mutant reduces significantly the penetrance of septation defects.",

The patient had been using minoxidil topically for androgenic alopecia for 8 years. On examination, mild swelling of the bulbar conjunctiva in the upper fornix was revealed; optical coherence tomography showed thinning of the ganglion cell layer, most likely due to moderate myopia. The patient responded well to discontinuation of minoxidil and topical therapy with prostaglandin analogues. After 4 months, an attempt was made to replace topical hypotensive therapy with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, but the previous hypotensive regimen had to be resumed due to an increase in IOP. During 10 months of observation, no signs of progression were detected according to optical coherence tomography and static perimetry.",

      "abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by bald patches in certain areas of the body, especially the scalp. Minoxidil (MNX), as a first-line treatment of AA, effectively induces hair growth. However, oral and topical administration pose problems, including low bioavailability, risk of uncontrolled hair growth, and local side effects such as burning hair loss, and scalp irritation. In the latest research, MNX was delivered to the skin via microneedle (MN) transdermally. The MNX concentration was distributed throughout the needle so that drug penetration was reduced and had the potential to irritate. In this study, we formulated MNX into three-layer dissolving microneedles (TDMN) to increase drug penetration and avoid irritation. Physicochemical evaluation, parafilm, was used to evaluate the mechanical strength of TDMN and showed that TDMN could penetrate the stratum corneum. The ex-vivo permeation test showed that the highest average permeation result was obtained for TDMN2, namely 165.28 ± 31.87 ug/cm2, while for Minoxidil cream it was 46.03 ± 8.5 ug/cm2. The results of ex vivo and in vivo dermatokinetic tests showed that the amount of drug concentration remaining in the skin from the TDMN2 formula was higher compared to the cream preparation. The formula developed has no potential for irritation and toxicity based on the HET-CAM test and hemolysis test. TDMN is a promising alternative to administering MNX to overcome MNX problems and increase the effectiveness of AA therapy.",

Clinical trials of topical finasteride have also yielded promising results, but routine care data are lacking. AIMS: To examine patient-reported outcomes of men with androgenetic alopecia who received topical finasteride admixed with minoxidil compared to the current standard of care (oral finasteride). METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional study with data from a German direct-to-consumer teledermatology platform between December 2021 and January 2023. Patient-reported outcomes were collected through voluntary follow-up questionnaires provided after 6 weeks on topical finasteride/minoxidil or oral finasteride treatment. RESULTS: A total of 1545 patients who received topical finasteride/minoxidil treatment were included; 238 (15.4%) participated in the follow-up questionnaire. At week six, 62.2% (148/238) reported positive changes in their hair appearance, and 44.1% (105/238) reported an improvement of self-esteem. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 11.8% (28/238). Full treatment adherence was observed in 74.4% (177/238). Comparing the topical treatment group to those receiving oral finasteride, lower treatment adherence was reported, along with higher rates of local adverse events; no difference was found in the incidence of sexual adverse events. CONCLUSION: Based on patient-reported outcomes, topical finasteride/minoxidil seems to be effective and well tolerated, but not superior to oral finasteride. Lower treatment adherence for topical usage must be considered when considering treatment options. Additional real-world data are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical finasteride/minoxidil.",

While LDOM is typically well tolerated, patients may experience a temporary increase in hair shedding starting treatment, colloquially regarded as \"dread shed\". One proposed method to combat this is to overlap therapies by maintaining use of topical minoxidil when initiating LDOM. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of maintaining topical minoxidil when initiating LDOM on \"dread shed\". METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients seen at New York University Langone Health Dermatology from January 1, 2008 to August 1, 2023 prescribed LDOM. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 37 maintained use of topical minoxidil when initiating LDOM. Six patients experienced \"dread shed\" when initiating LDOM, 2 of whom overlapped therapies. We did not find that overlapping therapies had a significant impact on decreasing rates of \"dread shed\". LIMITATIONS: Limitations include retrospective design, sample size, and subjective patient-reported assessment of hair shedding. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 5.2% of patients experienced dread shed, which is lower than previously reported in literature. Maintaining topical minoxidil during LDOM initiation does not significantly impact \"dread shed\". This remains a significant side effect deserving of further research."

Minoxidil is a vasodilator drug approved for topical use for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of topical minoxidil in enhancing beard growth in a group of t-AFAB people on GAHT. METHODS: Sixteen t-AFAB individuals with an incomplete beard development, on GAHT for at least 6 months, were enrolled. Topical minoxidil was applied to the interested facial areas. Before starting (T0), after 3 (T3) and 6 (T6) months, we evaluated facial hair growth using the Ferriman-Gallwey modified score (FGm). RESULTS: Subjects were 26 (2.7) years old and on GAHT for 18.5 [15-54] months; using a paired match evaluation, a statistically significant facial hair growth was observed over time, in particular at T6 (median upper lip FGm 3.5 [3-4] vs 2 [1-2] at T0 and chin FGm 4 [3.25-4] vs 1 [1-2] at T0; p ≤ 0.002). Comparing the minoxidil group with a control group (n = 16) matched for age and BMI who developed a full-grown beard only with GAHT, a logistic multivariable analysis identified hirsutism before GAHT was independently positively associated with the development of a full beard [OR 15.22 (95% CI 1.46-158.82); p = 0.023]. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating the efficacy of topical minoxidil in enhancing facial hair growth among t-AFAB people on GAHT. Further studies will be necessary to assess whether the obtained improvements will persist after discontinuing the medication.",

This study retrospectively observed the clinical efficacy of microneedle minoxidil combined with triamcinolone acetonide in the treatment of AA. METHODS: A total of 230 patients with AA were selected. The experimental group (n = 120) received physician training and home microneedle treatment with minoxidil combined with triamcinolone acetonide once a week. Topical minoxidil and triamcinolone acetonide were used twice daily at other times. The control group (n = 110) was treated with minoxidil combined with triamcinolone acetonide, twice a day. Cure rate, response rate, SALT, dermatological Quality of Life Index (DLQI), visual analogue (VAS), and cost were assessed at weeks 4 and 12. RESULTS: Treated group SALT score(Severity of Alopecia Tool) remarkable lower than control group after treated 4 and 12 weeks. After 12 weeks treatment, DLQI score of the treated group (1.8 ± 1.67) were significantly lower than those of the control group (2.45 ± 1.88) (p < 0.05). VAS score and adverse reaction between two group showed no significant different (p = 0.823, p = 0.484 respectively). The total cost was 53.93 ± 15.85 in the treatment group and 53.26 ± 11.51 in the control group. There was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.72).

      "abstract": "Background and objective Alopecia areata (AA) is a reiterative and nonscarring type of hair loss that can affect any hairy area of the body, particularly the scalp. It manifests as patchy or confluent hair loss with variations in demographics and ethnicity. There are numerous treatment options available, including topical and systemic steroids, topical minoxidil, dithranol, tacrolimus, psoralen and ultraviolet therapy (PUVA), contact immunotherapy, and oral immunosuppressive drugs. However, no previous contrast for efficacy is present between the topical betamethasone versus topical minoxidil alone in our population. This study aims to compare the efficacy of topical betamethasone dipropionate versus topical minoxidil in patients with AA. Methodology A nonrandomized controlled study was conducted at the Department of Dermatology, Jinnah Hospital Lahore, incorporating the data of patients between July 26, 2016, and January 26, 2017, after obtaining institutional ethical approval. One hundred patients with alopecia, either on the scalp or any other hairy part, from both genders, aged between 18 and 50 years, were included in the study. Two groups were created, and patients were assigned to these groups based on the clinician's choice. Group A patients were administered betamethasone dipropionate (0.05%) lotion twice daily on affected areas for 12 weeks. Group B patients were administered minoxidil (5%) solution twice daily on affected areas for 12 weeks. A four-week follow-up plan was followed. A five-point scale score system was used for alopecia grading. After 12 weeks, the hair regrowth score (RGS) was used to compare the efficacy of treatment between the two groups. Results A total of 100 patients with grades S1 to S3 AA of less than three months duration were enrolled. Two groups were created, with 50 patients in each group. The mean age in Group A was 29.08 ± 6.51 years, while in Group B, it was 29.38 ± 6.62 years. In Group A, there were 76% males and 24% females, while in Group B, there were 74% males and 26% females. Comparison of efficacy of topical betamethasone dipropionate versus topical minoxidil in patients with AA demonstrated a greater efficacy of 74% (Grade 3 and Grade 4 responses) in Group A, while in Group B, only 42% of patients showed efficacy. A statistically significant difference was found, with a P-value of 0.001. No serious side effects were noted. Conclusions Our study concluded that topical betamethasone dipropionate (0.05%) lotion has statistically significantly higher efficacy compared to topical minoxidil (5%) solution in patients with AA."

However, the efficacy of oral minoxidil for male AGA is yet to be evaluated in comparative therapeutic trials. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of daily oral minoxidil, 5 mg, vs twice-daily topical minoxidil, 5%, for 24 weeks in the treatment of male AGA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted at a single specialized clinic in Brazil. Eligible men with AGA aged 18 to 55 years classified using the Norwood-Hamilton scale as 3V, 4V, or 5V were included and randomized. Data were collected from January to December 2021, and data were analyzed from September 2022 to February 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 into 2 groups: oral minoxidil, 5 mg, daily and topical placebo solution; or 1 mL of topical minoxidil, 5%, twice daily and oral placebo for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in terminal hair density on the frontal and vertex regions of the scalp. The secondary outcomes were change in total hair density and photographic evaluation. RESULTS: Among 90 enrolled participants, 68 completed the study; of these, the mean (SD) age was 36.6 (7.8) years. A total of 33 participants were enrolled in the oral minoxidil group and 35 in the topical treatment group. Both groups were homogenous in terms of demographic data and AGA severity. For the frontal area, the mean change from baseline to week 24 between groups was 3.1 hairs per cm2 (95% CI, -18.2 to 21.5; P = .27) for terminal hair density and 2.6 hairs per cm2 (95% CI, -10.3 to 15.8; P = .32) for total hair density. For the vertex area, the mean change from baseline to week 24 was 23.4 hairs per cm2 (95% CI, -0.3 to 43.0; P = .09) for terminal density and 5.5 hairs per cm2 (95% CI, -12.5 to 23.5; P = .32) for total hair density. According to the photographic analysis, oral minoxidil was superior to topical minoxidil on the vertex (24%; 95% CI, 0 to 48; P = .04) but not on the frontal scalp (12%; 95% CI, -12 to 36; P = .24). The most common adverse effects in the oral minoxidil group were hypertrichosis (22 of 45 [49%]) and headache (6 of 45 [14%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, oral minoxidil, 5 mg, once per day for 24 weeks did not demonstrate superiority over topical minoxidil, 5%, twice per day in men with AGA.

RESULTS: A total of 84 dermatologists was included in this study, with 50 (60%) being male. It was found that 83 (99%) of the participants identified patterned hair loss as the most common indication for LDOM usage. Additionally, 77 (92%) recognized hypertrichosis as a well-known side effect. 48 (82%) of the dermatologists had never prescribed LDOM due to its unavailability in local pharmacies. CONCLUSION: The usage of LDOM for hair disorders is increasing. Nonetheless, many dermatologists abstain from prescribing this medication due to its limited availability in local pharmacies."

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of CRVO with cystoid macular edema (CME) in a young, otherwise healthy patient taking minoxidil for hair loss. The patient had no known vascular risk factors, and a comprehensive coagulability workup was negative. The CRVO with CME resolved without intervention upon cessation of minoxidil. CONCLUSION: Possible mechanisms for minoxidil-associated retinal vascular disorders are explored. Thorough medication histories and the consideration of possible adverse drug events in patients without traditional risk factors are recommended."

      "abstract": "Introduction Androgenetic pattern of alopecia is a common problem occurring in men, which mostly arises from their younger age. There are many therapies advocated in the literature for hair loss reduction, and one of them is platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of combined PRP therapy with topical minoxidil over PRP as monotherapy in hair loss reduction and regeneration of new hair. Materials and methods The study was conducted at our institute in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Saveetha Dental College and Hospital. The study consisted of 40 participants, 20 of whom had only PRP therapy as part of their treatment, while the other 20 participants received PRP combined with topical minoxidil as treatment. Both group participants were evaluated for postoperative hair shaft diameter and hair follicle density. Parameters were measured preoperatively and postoperatively after one month, two months, and three months. Data analysis was done with the help of SPSS, with P-values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the two groups for measurement of hair shaft diameter, and for comparison between hair follicle density, an unpaired t-test was used. Results It was found that the mean hair shaft diameter in the PRP with minoxidil group was higher than that of the PRP group for one month (P = 0.023), two months (P = 0.001), and three months (P = 0.001) postoperative periods, and the results were statistically significant. Hair follicle density (mean hair quantity) was higher in the PRP group than in the PRP with the minoxidil group in the first postoperative month. However, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). While the mean hair quantity in the PRP with minoxidil group was higher than that in the PRP group for two months (P = 0.45) and three months (P = 0.001) postoperative periods, the results were statistically significant only at the three-month postoperative period. Conclusion It can be concluded that injectable autologous PRP with minoxidil as a topical agent is a better treatment option for the improvement of both hair quality (hair shaft diameter) and hair quantity (hair follicle density) compared to plain autologous injectable PRP monotherapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Topical minoxidil (TM) has been a cornerstone in treating various hair loss disorders, while low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) is emerging as an effective alternative. Despite their widespread use, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding their use in treating scarring alopecia. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of TM and LDOM in managing scarring alopecia. METHODS: A systematic literature search identified relevant studies on TM and LDOM use in central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, frontal fibrosing alopecia, lichen planopilaris, and traction alopecia. Key metrics included disease stabilization, hair thickness improvement, hair regrowth, and side effect profiles. RESULTS: Analysis of the selected studies revealed mixed outcomes. Most participants experienced benefits in terms of disease stabilization and hair regrowth with TM and LDOM. The majority of cases reported good tolerability of the treatment, although some side effects were noted. CONCLUSION: TM and LDOM show promise in scarring alopecia treatment, demonstrating benefits in disease stabilization and hair regrowth. Despite these positive indications, the variability in results and reported side effects underline the need for further research to establish their consistent efficacy and safety profiles in scarring alopecia treatment.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Utilization of low-dose oral minoxidil has increased in recent years in association with several clinical studies that have shown its efficacy in treating androgenetic alopecia (AGA).&nbsp; Objective: To assess dermatology providers' attitudes and recommendation behaviors of oral minoxidil for the treatment of AGA. METHODS: An online survey gauging the professional opinions, prescribing behaviors, and use of oral minoxidil was sent using the Orlando Dermatology Aesthetic and Clinical Conference email listserv which included multiple levels of dermatology practitioners including MD/DOs, NPs, and PAs across the United States. RESULTS: Overall, the survey was sent to 2200 providers, and 201 (9.1%) responses were collected. 81% (n=139) of respondents supported the use of oral minoxidil for AGA. Support varied significantly (P=.03) by providers' number of years in practice with those in practice for greater than 30 years with the least amount of support. 92% of respondents (130, n=141) reported feeling comfortable prescribing oral minoxidil, and 83% (116, n=140) found oral minoxidil to be better than its topical formulation. 78% (108, n=139) felt their patients were satisfied with their results, and 89% (124, n=140) felt oral minoxidil was well tolerated by their patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that most prescribers use oral minoxidil as a treatment for AGA and find it to be an effective and tolerable option for patients. Support for oral minoxidil was significantly impacted by providers' years in practice.&nbsp;J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(3): doi:10.36849/JDD.7519.",
