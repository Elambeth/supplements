      "abstract": "Pramiracetam has been evaluated for its potential antiamnesic properties in scopolamine-induced amnesia in healthy volunteers. Two groups of twelve males, 18-42 and 55-65 years old, respectively, were randomly assigned to oral treatment with pramiracetam (600 mg twice a day) or with placebo for 10 consecutive days. On day 11 each subject was injected intramuscularly with scopolamine hydrobromide (0.5 mg). Before scopolamine injection and then 1, 3 and 6 h after it, subjects were administered the following psychometric tests: simple and choice visual reaction times, digit symbol substitution test, Rey's 15 words test for short and long term verbal memory. Scopolamine significantly impaired episodic memory and selective attention tests in both scopolamine and placebo groups. Instead visuo-motor and incidental learning measures were unaffected. Pramiracetam, when compared to placebo, was able to partially reduce the amnesic effects induced by scopolamine both in young and old subjects."

We evaluated antidementia efficacy of this drug in 10 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease employing a 2-phase, placebo-controlled, enrichment-type trial design. Eight patients evidenced a best dose in the dose-finding phase, but in the subsequent replication phase only two again improved to a similar degree. PETs with fluorodeoxyglucose obtained in two individuals showed no definite change. Doses up to 4,000 mg pramiracetam are unlikely to confer symptomatic benefit to Alzheimer's disease patients.",

      "abstract": "The choline transport across the blood-brain barrier was studied in nine brain regions of male Wistar rats after treatment with scopolamine, piracetam and pramiracetam, respectively. 14-Day treatment with scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg/d) elicited an increase of the extraction and the PS-product (permeability-surface area) of choline which was prevented by coinjection of piracetam or pramiracetam (100 mg/kg/d). In addition, the cerebral blood flow was increased by both nootropics. Differences between various brain regions were found in both choline transport and cerebral blood flow. It is supposed from the results that the choline transport is regulated by cholinergic innervation of the brain endothelial cells and that the nootropics used may act via alterations of the brain choline metabolism.",

      "abstract": "A series of N-[(dialkylamino)alkyl]-2-oxo-1- pyrrolidineacetamides was synthesized. The title compounds reversed electroconvulsive shock (ECS) induced amnesia in mice when administered subsequent to the ECS treatment and were inactive in a general observational test for central nervous system (CNS) activity. Active compounds exhibited an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. Among the compounds with the broadest dose-response curve, as well as the most potent, were those with the N-[2-[bis(1-methylethyl)amino] ethyl] or 2,6- dimethylpiperidinoethyl residues as amide substituent. The N-(dialkylamino) substituent markedly enhances amnesia-reversal activity, with ethylene providing the optimal chain length. N-[2-[Bis(1-methylethyl)amino]ethyl] -2-oxo-1- pyrrolidineacetamide N-(dialkylamino) substituent was selected for preclinical toxicological evaluation, assigned the investigational number CI-879 and the U.S. adopted name ( USAN ) pramiracetam . Pramiracetam demonstrated a wide margin of safety in animals and was well tolerated in normal human volunteers. It has shown encouraging activity in an open label trial in patients with primary degenerative dementia (PDD or senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type).",
