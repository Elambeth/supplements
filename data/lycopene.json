      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases, with a range of manifestations, such as hepatic steatosis. Our previous study showed that Kaili Sour Soup (KSS) significantly attenuated hepatic steatosis in rats. This study explored the main components of KSS and the mechanisms by which it exerts its protective effects against NAFLD. METHODS: Twenty-four 6-week-old male Sprague-Dowley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to three treatments: feeding a normal standard diet, a high-fat diet, or a high-fat diet plus gavage KSS. The effects of KSS treatment on hepatic lipid accumulation were assessed using biochemical, histological, and molecular experiments. The amounts of KSS ingredients were measured using biochemical assays. Network pharmacology analyses were performed to identify the hub genes of KSS targets and enriched pathways. CCK-8 assay was used to determine the effect of free fatty acids (FFA), lycopene, and estrogen on HepG2 viability. Quantitative Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot assays were performed to determine the effect of KSS or lycopene on estrogen signaling and expression of lipid metabolism-related molecules. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism and SPSS. RESULTS: KSS alleviated fat deposition in rat liver tissue and affected the expression of hepatic lipid synthesis, catabolism, and oxidative molecules. Lycopene was identified as the ingredient with the highest amount in KSS. Network pharmacology analyses showed that the hub genes were enriched in the estrogen signaling pathway. Cellular experiments showed that lycopene increased the expression of Estrogen Receptor α (ERα), Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 A (CPT1A), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) (all p < 0.01), and Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) (p < 0.05), and reduced the expression of lipid metabolism-related factors 1c(SREBP-1c) (p < 0.01), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC) and Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: KSS ameliorated abnormal lipid metabolism in patients with NAFLD. Lycopene was the major component of KSS, and it affected estrogen signaling and the expression of lipid metabolism molecules. In short, both KSS and LYC could change lipid metabolism by lowering lipid accumulation and raising lipolysis.",

      "abstract": "Aging-related diseases, which are associated with the senescence of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), are consistently accompanied by elevated levels of circulating trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a marker predictive of poor prognosis. Lycopene (Lyc) deficiency has been demonstrated to be linked to these age-related diseases. The AMPK/SIRT1 pathway plays a pivotal role in cellular senescence. In this study, we hypothesize that lycopene could mitigate TMAO-induced EPCs senescence, with involvement of the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway. EPCs were subjected to treatment with TMAO, Lyc, small interfering RNA targeting AMP-activated protein kinase (siAMPK), or sirtin-1 (siSIRT1). The biological functions of EPCs were evaluated through, CCK-8, transwell and tube formation assays, while their senescence was assessed via SA-β-gal activity assay and Western blotting. ROS generation was measured using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining. TMAO-induced suppression of EPCs' functionality was alleviated by Lyc, but this effect was reversed by siAMPK and siSIRT1. TMAO increased SA-β-gal-positive cell number and ROS production, while reducing the expression of AMPK and SIRT1. These effects were attenuated by Lyc. However, the protective effects were diminished by siAMPK and siSIRT1. In conclusion, Lyc ameliorates TMAO-induced EPCs senescence through the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) poses a threat to fish and human health. Carp is the most widely farmed fish, and it is necessary to study the mechanism of Cd toxicity and effective mitigation methods for Cd poisoning in carps. We previously found that Cd up-regulated miR-375 in common carp spleens, and that IRS1, a factor involved in glucose (GLU) uptake, was a potential target gene of miR-375. However, whether Cd can decrease GLU uptake ability in fish remains unknown. Oxidative stress (OS) and actin cytoskeleton dysfunction (ACD) can take part in the mechanisms of GLU uptake ability reduction. Lycopene (Lyc) is a natural plant antioxidant, and epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells are a model cell to study carps. Therefore, we conducted experiments with Cd or/and Lyc treatments to investigate the mechanisms of Lyc alleviating Cd-cytotoxicity on EPC cells from the perspectives of miR-375, OS, ACD, and GLU uptake ability. We found that Lyc mitigated Cd-caused miR-375 increase, OS, ACD, and GLU uptake ability reduction. Moreover, miR-375 overexpression/knockdown experiments demonstrated that miR-375 mediated OS, ACD, and GLU uptake ability reduction and targeted regulated IRS1-PI3K-AKT. Furthermore, NAC intervention experiment demonstrated that ROS mediated ACD and the reduction of GLU uptake via ROS/IRS1-PI3K-AKT. Taken together, Lyc alleviated Cd-decreased GLU uptake ability via miR-375-ROS/IRS1-PI3K-AKT and miR-375/IRS1-PI3K-AKT pathways in EPC cells. Our findings highlighted significant role of miR-375 in Cd-induced toxicity and elucidated the mechanism by which Lyc alleviated Cd-induced toxicity. Our study can provide new information and new targets for resisting environmental pollutant stress in animals.",

      "abstract": "Atrazine (ATZ) and diaminochlorotriazine (DACT) accumulation poses liver health risks in animals and humans. Lycopene (LYC), a carotenoid found in red plants and fruits, exhibits potent antioxidant effects. This study explores the interaction between LYC and ATZ in mouse hepatocyte ferroptosis and the potential regulatory role of Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR) in this process. Male mice were exposed to ATZ (50 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg) and/or LYC (5 mg/kg) by gavage for 21 days. In vitro experiments, a mouse hepatocyte cell line (AML12) was exposed to DACT (200 μM) and/or LYC (2 μM) for 12 h with or without small interfering RNA treatment. We found that both ATZ and DACT promoted CYPOR expression and caused liver injury. ATZ/DACT promotes Fe2+ accumulation and lipid peroxidation, ultimately leading to Ferroptosis in mouse hepatocytes. However, LYC alleviated ATZ/DACT-induced Ferroptosis by inhibiting CYPOR. The CYPOR knockdown resulted in the blockage of ATZ/DACT-induced ferroptosis, while the alleviation of ferroptosis by LYC was further enhanced. Thus, CYPOR can regulate ferroptosis in mouse hepatocytes and is a novel target for the treatment of hepatocyte ferroptosis-related diseases. Lycopene can be used as a functional dietary supplement to scavenge ferroptosis and reduce chronic liver disease."

      "abstract": "Kidney disease is a major public health problem worldwide and one of the common causes of death in patients. How to effectively treat or alleviate renal diseases has not only attracted the attention of a large number of scholars, but is likewise a great challenge. Oxidative stress is the main mechanism leading to kidney injury. Natural antioxidant substances not only have efficient antioxidant capacity, but also have the advantage of high safety and low side effects. Lycopene is a naturally occurring carotenoid found mainly in tomatoes or tomato products. Epidemiologic investigations have shown that lycopene has potent antioxidant properties, scavenges reactive substances, and has a protective role in kidney disease. This paper summarizes the biochemical properties and antioxidant mechanisms of lycopene in the context of animal experiments and clinical studies of lycopene in renal diseases. We found that lycopene exerts its protective effects against kidney injury mainly through anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects. Meanwhile, lycopene has been found to reduce the incidence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) as well as mortality in some CKD patients. In addition to this, lycopene intake is negatively correlated with the incidence of kidney cancer and also mitigates the nephrotoxic damage of cisplatin. Therefore, lycopene has a promising application in the treatment of kidney diseases. However, there are relatively few clinical studies on lycopene in renal diseases, and subsequent research studies in large-scale populations are still needed to determine the value of lycopene in renal diseases even further.",

      "abstract": "Cis (Z)-lycopene exhibits higher bioavailability and tissue accumulation efficiency compared with all-trans (E)-lycopene. A simulated food system was developed to convert all-E-lycopene to its Z-isomers during processing. This system consisted of an aqueous phase containing plant-derived sulfur-containing compounds and a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil phase with dissolved all-E-lycopene. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of sulfur-containing compounds from different plant sources and heat treatments on lycopene isomerization and degradation. The results indicated that, compared with shiitake extract, leek extract, glucoraphanin, wasabi extract, and horseradish, allicin, alliin, and sulforaphane significantly promoted the Z-lycopene content under the optimal heat treatment conditions. The Z-lycopene content increased from 4.91 % to 77.1 %, 68.91 %, and 75.84 % in the allicin, alliin, and sulforaphane groups, respectively. Additionally, except for the shiitake extract group, the addition of other sulfur-containing compounds did not significantly affect lycopene degradation compared with thermal treatment alone (p > 0.05). For better quantitative analysis in food systems, alliin was used as a reference. The application of this method demonstrated that in screened alliin-rich garlic juice (21.20 mg/g) mixed with tomato pulp and MCT oil system, the percentage of total-Z-lycopene increased from 12.14 % to 59.57 %. The bioaccessibility of total-Z-lycopene significantly improved with the addition of garlic juice (p < 0.01). Among all isomers, the bioaccessibility of 9-Z-lycopene and 5-Z-lycopene showed the most significant increase (p < 0.01). This novel tomato pulp system enables the effective utilization of lycopene during processing.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Lycopene (LYC) is a dietary nutrient that plays a protective role in various cardiovascular diseases. Doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity is an important cause of poor prognosis in many cancer patients treated with anthracyclines. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of LYC against DOX-induced heart failure (HF) and specific underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DOX was used to establish HF model in cardiomyocytes and C57BL/6J mice to assess the protection of LYC against DOX-induced HF on inflammation, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis. KEY FINDINGS: LYC ameliorated DOX-induced deterioration of cardiac function. Mechanistically, LYC reduced collagen content and fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Additionally, LYC inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by upregulating antioxidant enzymes expression. LYC enhanced B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), but reduced apoptosis positive cells by reducing tumor protein 53 (p53), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), and cleaved-Caspase 3 (c-Casp3) levels. Besides, LYC reduced inflammatory cytokine levels through activating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Moreover, LYC ameliorated DOX-induced ferroptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we showed that LYC inhibited DOX-induced ferroptosis via binding to nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to enhance its expression. SIGNIFICANCE: LYC improved DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which was contributed by the reduction of ferroptosis. At molecular levels, LYC ameliorated DOX-induced ferroptosis through activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. These findings indicate the potential of LYC as a therapeutic option for HF treatment.",

Results revealed that ultrasound treatment promoted reactive groups exposure and structural unfolding of β-LG to interact with six flavonoids. The main driving force between β-LG and flavonoids was hydrophobic interaction. The docking result showed that the preferred binding site for these flavonoids was on the outer surface of β-LG. The thermal stability, surface hydrophilicity, and antioxidant properties of β-LG-API, β-LG-LUT, and β-LG-MY complexes were superior by multi-spectroscopy methods and molecular simulation analysis (P < 0.05). The ability of β-LG-API for delivering LY was the best among above three binary complexes, revealing superior environmental stability and bioavailability of the β-LG-API-LY complex. This study will help to understand the ultrasound-assisted noncovalent binding of protein-flavonoid complexes, and exhibit the potential as a novel delivery system for delivery and protection of LY."

This research aims to elucidate how LYC impacts polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and the action mechanisms. A PCOS rat model was constructed by injecting DHEA. Different doses of LYC were injected intraperitoneally in PCOS rats, the estrous cycle was recorded. The histopathological damage of ovary in PCOS rats was observed by HE staining, testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were examined by ELISA kits. Transmission electron microscopy, prussian blue staining, biochemical kits to determine ferroptosis. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot to assess the levels of ferroptosis-related and AMPK/Nrf2 pathway-related proteins to explore whether LYC affects ferroptosis in PCOS through this pathway. PCOS rats had significantly higher body weights, ovarian weights and ovarian indices, and disorganized estrous cycles, which were dose-dependently ameliorated by LYC. In addition, LYC significantly ameliorated the histopathological damage of ovary in PCOS rats and restored the normal secretion of T, E2, LH, and FSH. LYC attenuates iron deposition in PCOS ovarian tissues, reduces iron and ROS levels, and inhibits ferroptosis. Notably, LYC activated the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway, and AMPK inhibitor intervention attenuated the therapeutic effect of LYC in PCOS rats, suggesting that LYC acts through the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway. LYC attenuates estrous cycle disruption, ameliorates pathological impairments, and inhibits ferroptosis in PCOS rats by modulating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway.",

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, referred to as \"chemobrain\", is widely acknowledged as a significant adverse effect of cancer therapy. Paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic drug, has been reported to cause cognitive impairment clinically and in animal models. However, the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. The current study explored the potential neuroprotective effect of lycopene in paclitaxel-induced cognitive impairment in mice and its potential underlying mechanisms. Mice were randomly allocated into six groups: control, paclitaxel-treated (10 mg/kg), lycopene-treated (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) + paclitaxel, and lycopene alone-treated (20 mg/kg) groups. The effect of lycopene treatment on behavioral function and histological examination was assessed. Lycopene (20 mg/kg) was selected for additional investigation into the underlying mechanisms. Lycopene treatment counteracted paclitaxel-induced oxidative stress by reducing lipid peroxidation and enhancing catalase levels. Additionally, lycopene-treated mice demonstrated a significant elevation in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 with no significant effect on hemeoxygenase-1. Moreover, paclitaxel administration elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress markers; glucose-regulated protein78, activating Transcription Factor 6, C/EBP homologous protein, and apoptosis marker annexin V which were significantly reduced by lycopene treatment. Furthermore, lycopene mitigated paclitaxel-induced neuroinflammation through the reduction of the levels of the NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome axis markers; nuclear factor-κB, NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-18. Our study findings may provide new evidence that lycopene mitigates paclitaxel-induced cognitive impairment in mice by reversing oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammatory mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Lycopene is a natural plant extract widely studied for its powerful antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. Emerging evidence suggests that it also possesses potential antidepressant properties. Compared to commonly used clinical antidepressants, lycopene offers higher safety; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to explore the mechanisms through which lycopene exerts its antidepressant effects. We employed the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model to induce depressive-like behaviors in mice, followed by lycopene treatment (20 mg/kg). Based on previous research, we focused on synaptic plasticity by examining the expression of synaptic proteins in the hippocampus to uncover potential mechanisms. The results showed that CSDS induced synaptic plasticity impairments in the hippocampus but lycopene treatment significantly improved these synaptic deficits and reversed the depressive-like behaviors induced by CSDS. Moreover, lycopene treatment upregulated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduced the activity of BDNF-TrkB/pTrkB pathway in the hippocampus. These molecular changes were consistent with changes in synaptic-related proteins, suggesting that lycopene may enhance synaptic plasticity via the BDNF-TrkB/pTrkB signaling pathway. This study explored the mechanisms underlying depressive-like behaviors induced by CSDS in mice and provided preclinical evidence that lycopene may serve as a potential antidepressant. It offers an effective avenue for the development of novel antidepressant therapies."

      "abstract": "Malt protein Z (PZ), the main albumin in malt endosperm, exhibits trypsin inhibitory activity and has the ability to bind fat-soluble active molecules. However, its potential utilization as a food ingredient necessitates an evaluation of its allergenicity. Lycopene has many functional activities, such as antioxidant and treatment or alleviation of various diseases, but its tendency to degrade easily hinders its effective utilization. Therefore, this paper investigates the allergenicity of PZ and provides a win-win scenario that PZ interacts with lycopene. PZ interacts with lycopene through non-covalent interactions with a ratio of 4.07 ± 0.20, leading to the formation of homogenous particles with an increased absolute zeta potential, from -7.3 ± 0.2 to -20.0 ± 0.6. Unsurprisingly, the presence of lycopene alleviates the allergenicity of PZ by decreasing the IgE, mMcp-1 and vascular permeability, such as the plasma mMcp-1 decreased from 245.0 ± 5.2 ng/mL for the PZ group to 217.8 ± 4.1 ng/mL for the PZ-LYC group. To uncover the potential mechanism, the linear antigenic epitopes of PZ by ABCpred were predicted, which are almost the potential binding site of lycopene at PZ. On the other hand, PZ improved the storage stability of lycopene. The addition of PZ increased lycopene retention in solution from 14.9 ± 2.7 % to 65.5 ± 2.8 % over 10 days at room temperature with light exposure. These results provide foundations for PZ utilization concerning security, and give ways to protect bioactive molecules.",

METHODS: Sixty 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: normal control group, PM_(2.5) model group, reference control group(vitamin E dose group, 7.5 mg/kg), and three lycopene groups with low-dose(5 mg/kg), medium dose(15 mg/kg) and high dose(30 mg/kg), with 10 rats in each group. Except for the control group, all groups were exposed to PM_(2.5) suspension intratracheally(equivalent to 7.5 mg/kg), poisoning 3 times a week, with an interval of 24 hours between each test. The vitamin E intervention group dissolved the salad oil with vitamin E by daily gavage, while the control group received an equal amounts of physiological saline. From the first day of exposure, lycopene was given daily via gavage for 4 weeks. Lycopene groups received lycopene dissolved in salad oil, while control and model groups received salad oil of the same volume. After 4 weeks, all rats were killed. Lung pathology sections were made and serum and lung tissue were collected and homogenized, centrifuge and collect the supernatant. Using UV visible spectrophotometry to measure levels of glutathione peroxidase(GSH-Px), glutataione(GSH), superoxide dismutase(SOD), total antioxidant capacity(T-AOC), malondialdehyde(MDA), glutathione S-transferase(GST), catalase(CAT), hydroxyl radical(OH), nitric oxide(NO). Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent Assays(ELISA) to measure levels of tumor necrosis facto-α(TNF-α), interleukin-6(IL-6), and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine(8-OHdG). Lung histopathology was also observed. RESULTS: Compared to the normal control group, there were significant differences in the content of GSH((9.47±1.37)mg/g vs. (11.10±3.82)mg/g), SOD((9.43±2.41)U/mg vs. (13.82±4.64)U/mg), CAT((5.35±1.88)U/mg vs. (9.54±3.06)U/mg), 8-OHdG((5.52±1.66)μg/g vs. (4.76±1.01)μg/g) in the serum, and GSH((2.19±0.29)mg/g vs. (3.18±0.49)mg/g), SOD((23.98±4.20)U/mg vs. (31.95±5.08)U/mg), CAT((5.85±1.95)U/mg vs. (3.57±1.96)U/mg), GSH-Px((49.15±7.01)mg/g vs. (68.46±11.15)mg/g), OH·((74.02±12.84)U/mg vs. (51.03±14.85)U/mg), TNF-α((5.57±0.72)ng/g vs. (7.83±1.60)ng/g), IL-6((2.68±0.39)μg/g vs. (3.82±1.35)μg/g) in lung tissue homogenates of PM_(2.5) group(P&lt;0.05). These indicated that there were oxidative damage to the body. Compared to the PM_(2.5) group, there were significant differences in the content of GSH((10.57±2.88)mg/g vs. (9.47±1.37)mg/g), SOD((13.51±2.95)U/mg vs. (9.43±2.41)U/mg), 8-OHdG((4.38±0.26)μg/g vs. (5.52±1.66)μg/g) in the serum and GSH((2.72±0.49)mg/g vs. (2.19±0.29)mg/g), GSH-Px((63.46±17.03)mg/g vs. (49.15±7.01)), CAT((3.72±1.28)U/mg vs. (5.85±1.95)U/mg), OH·((65.73±14.88)U/mg vs. (74.02±12.84)U/mg), NO((3.83±1.60)μmol/mg vs. (2.48±1.49)μmol/mg), TNF-α((7.49±1.28)ng/g vs. (5.57±0.72)ng/g), IL-6((3.77±1.35)μg/g vs. (2.68±0.39)μg/g) in lung tissue homogenates of the high-dose lycopene group(P&lt;0.05); the content of GSH((10.57±2.88)mg/g vs. (9.43±2.41)mg/g), CAT((10.61±4.41)U/mg vs. (5.35±1.88)mg/g) in the serum, and GSH((2.77±0.75)mg/g vs. (2.19±0.29)mg/g), SOD((30.88±9.65)U/mg vs. (23.98±4.20)U/mg), CAT((4.52±1.30)U/mg vs. (5.85±1.95)U/mg), TNF-α((7.37±2.50)ng/g vs. (5.57±0.72)ng/g), IL-6((3.80±1.36)μg/g vs. (2.68±0.39)μg/g) in lung tissue homogenates of the medium-dose group(P&lt;0.01). the content of GSH((10.64±2.71)mg/g vs. (9.47±1.37)mg/g), SOD((13.51±2.95)U/mg vs. (9.43±2.41)U/mg) in the serum, and OH·((67.29±16.11)U/mg vs. (74.02±12.84)U/mg) in lung tissue homogenates of the vitamin E group(P&lt;0.05). The PM_(2.5) group had alveolar structure destruction, alveolar septal thickening, pulmonary interstitial oedema, inflammatory infiltration. In the lycopene high-dose intervention group had intact alveolar structure, with a few neutrophil infiltration inside and outside the bronchiolar lumen, the aggregation degree of inflammatory cells was lower than that of the PM_(2.5) group, blood vessels were slightly dilated and congested, and the pulmonary interstitium was slightly widened, medium dose and low dose of lycopene are more obvious. In the vitamin E group performed similar to the lycopene medium-dose intervention group. suggesting a protective effect of lycopene on lung tissue integrity. CONCLUSION: Lycopene exhibits protective effects against PM_(2.5)-induced oxidative lung damage, likely through its enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activities, reduction of free radical-induced oxidative damage, and stabilization of biological membranes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epididymitis, a common disease of the male reproductive system, is often caused by nonspecific infections. Antibiotics alone cannot reverse histopathological changes or prevent long-term reproductive issues. Lycopene (LYC), a potent antioxidant, has shown potential in alleviating epididymitis, yet its specific mechanisms remain unclear. This study used network pharmacology and in vivo experiments to explore LYC's mechanisms in treating epididymitis. METHODS: Epididymitis- and LYC-related target proteins were identified from multiple databases and analyzed using the Venny platform. Protein interactions were examined with the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database, and key targets were identified via topological analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database. Target-pathway networks were visualized in Cytoscape, molecular docking was performed with AutoDock Vina, and LYC's effects were validated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced epididymitis mouse model. RESULTS: Network pharmacology results indicated that LYC's effects involve the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in regulating inflammation and apoptosis. In vivo, LYC improved epididymal pathology, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and decreased key inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). By inhibiting PI3K/AKT activation, LYC modulated inflammation and reduced apoptosis. Additionally, LYC enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity and elevated the B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) ratio, reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis. Molecular docking supported these findings, showing strong binding affinities with PI3K/AKT pathway targets. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights LYC's potential as an adjunctive treatment for epididymitis, targeting inflammation and oxidative stress via the PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings suggest that LYC could enhance current therapies and provide new options for the clinical management of epididymitis."

      "abstract": "Male infertility is a major concern around the world, and efforts to find effective therapies to improve reproductive results are continuing. Factors such as genetics, hormonal disorders, lifestyle, and environmental pollutants have been mentioned as the pathoetiology of male infertility. The treatment of male infertility is far from optimal despite the recent signs of progress provided by assisted reproductive technology. Therefore, many efforts are being made to improve the therapeutical approaches to male infertility, which generally target the factors involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. Lycopene is a naturally occurring pigment belonging to the carotenoid family, which imparts a vibrant red color to various fruits and vegetables. It is widely assumed that lycopene may be an optimal option for the improvement of male fertility, however, the verification its therapeutic potential in male infertility has not been comprehensively reviewed. The study discusses the ability of lycopene to improve semen parameters, including sperm morphology, and motility which are important determinants of male reproductive health. Moreover, lycopene's capacity to regulate sex hormones, such as testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which play crucial roles in sperm production and maturation is explained. Additionally, lycopene effects on specific signaling pathways involved in male fertility, including prokineticin-2 (PROK2) and PI3K/Akt pathways, that influence sperm function are clarified. Furthermore, the impacts of lycopene as a potent antioxidant in defending against oxidative stress, a leading cause of male infertility, are presented. Overall, the results indicate that lycopene may have beneficial effects on improving male fertility by increasing sperm parameters, modulating sex hormones and signaling pathways, and providing antioxidant protection. Due to limited reports, additional clinical data is required to confirm the positive effects of lycopene on male fertility in humans.",

The small-granule starch extracted from A. squarrosum seeds was processed using ionic liquids (ILs) as an effective \"green\" solvent, followed by a systematic treatment involving ultrasonication and pullulanase to prepare the ASSNPs. The resulting nanoparticles exhibited small size, narrow particle size distribution, negative zeta potential, and high encapsulation efficiency of up to 64.3 %. The structures of ASSNPs were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. These analytical techniques confirmed the successful encapsulation of LYC and revealed increased intermolecular interactions. Stability and degradation experiments demonstrated that the retention of the LYC in the complexes was significantly higher than that of the unencapsulated LYC, highlighting the superior protective effects of ASSNPs on the storage and digestive stability of LYC. This research elucidated the structural features of the complex between ASSNPs and LYC, underscoring the potential of ASSNPs as a food-grade delivery system.

In this study, the effects of lycopene on experimental giardiasis in mice were investigated by evaluating cyst shedding rate, weight changes, duodenal antioxidant status, and histopathological alteration. Ninety-five male mice aged four to six weeks were divided into six groups of 15 and one group of 5 as the negative control. All mice were infected with 2 × 105 Giardia duodenalis (B genotype) cysts except for the negative control. The treatment groups were treated with metronidazole, mixed lycopene-metronidazole, and 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg lycopene for 7 days. The mice treated with lycopene 20 and mixed lycopene-metronidazole had no cyst shedding from the 7th day of treatment. The mildest lesions were observed in the mixed lycopene-metronidazole group. Results showed that treatment with mixed lycopene-metronidazole significantly increased TAC and decreased MDA levels as compared with the positive control. It seems that the antigiardial effect of lycopene is related to its antioxidant properties. Nevertheless, direct effect of lycopene on Giardia and its probable mechanism remain to be investigated."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prevention of postoperative abdominal adhesions is one of the top concerns of surgeons after abdominal surgery. Therefore, identifying effective interventions to reduce postoperative abdominal adhesions are essential. METHODS: Fifty male Bagg's albino/c mice were randomly divided into five groups, and all groups underwent postoperative adhesion model surgery, except for the sham group. The sham and control groups were gavaged with saline solution. Based on the control group, the sodium hyaluronate group was treated with 1 mL sodium hyaluronate (smeared on the modeling site and the abdominal cavity was closed). The other two groups were gavaged with different doses of lycopene (10 μg/kg and 20 μg/kg). Seven d after surgery, the mice were sacrificed and adhesion conditions were assessed using Nair's scoring system. Subsequently, adherent tissues were harvested and the inflammation was assessed by using haematoxylin and eosin staining and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-β1. Oxidative stress and collagen deposition condition were also detected in each mouse. Furthermore, a lycopene-induced HMrSV5 cell model was used to explore the possible functional mechanisms. RESULTS: 20 μg/kg of lycopene-treated group had a lower Nair's and inflammation score, both with an average score of 1.75. Also, the level of transforming growth factor -β1 and interleukin-6 in the 20 μg/kg of lycopene-treated group was lower than others. Furthermore, 20 μg/kg of lycopene had reduced the reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels in adhesion tissues compared to other groups. Fiber thickness and α-smooth muscle actin expression in adherent tissues were significantly reduced after lycopene treatment. Besides, 20 μg/kg of lycopene treatment can promote the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and silent information regulator 1. In in-vitro studies, lycopene protected mesothelial cells from H2O2 -induced oxidative stress injury. CONCLUSIONS: Lycopene can attenuate abdominal adhesion in the mouse model by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, and the possible mechanism may rely on promoting the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and silent information regulator 1.",

      "abstract": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most used anticancer drugs. However, its nephrotoxicity-associated drawback is of clinical concern. Lycopene (LYC) is a red carotenoid with remarkable anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. In this study, rats were divided randomly into five groups: control, lycopene (10 mg) (10 mg/kg/day; P.O), 5-FU (30 mg/kg/day; i.p.), Lycopene (5 mg) + 5-FU (5 mg/kg + 30 mg/kg/day), and lycopene (10 mg) + 5-FU (10 mg/kg + 30 mg/kg/day). LYC attenuated the loss of renal function induced by 5-FU in a dose-dependent manner. Rats co-treated with LYC had lower serum urea, creatinine, uric acid and KIM-1 levels, and a higher serum albumin level than those receiving 5-FU alone. Furthermore, co-treatment with the high dose of LYC maintained renal oxidant-antioxidant balance by ameliorating/preventing the loss of antioxidants and the elevation of malondialdehyde. Rats treated with 5-FU had markedly lower renal levels of PPAR-gamma, HO-1, Nfr2, and Il-10 and higher levels of NF-kB, TNF-alpha, and IL6 compared to the control rats. Co-treatment with LYC attenuated the reduction in PPAR-gamma, HO-1, Nfr2, and IL-10 levels and moderated the elevated levels of NF-kB, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. The kidneys from rats co-treated with lycopene (10 mg) + 5-FU did not show the degenerative changes in the glomerular tufts and tubules observed for the rats treated with 5-FU alone. In conclusion, LYC is a promising therapeutic strategy for attenuating 5-FU-induced nephrotoxicity through the restoration of antioxidant activities and inhibition of inflammatory responses by modulating PPAR-γ, Nrf2/HO-1, and NF-κB/TNF-α/IL-6, signals.",

      "abstract": "Background: Metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are closely related. They are characterized by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Obesity is the most important risk factor for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance and elevated blood glucose levels, among other conditions. These disorders contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, which can exacerbate other metabolic problems. Methods: Numerous studies indicate that diet and nutrients can have a major impact on preventing and treating these conditions. One such ingredient is lycopene. It is a naturally occurring carotenoid with a unique chemical structure. It exhibits strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties due to its conjugated double bonds and its ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species. Its properties make lycopene indirectly affect many cellular processes. The article presents studies in animal models and humans on the activity of this carotenoid in metabolic problems. Results: The findings suggest that lycopene's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities make it a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: This review underscores the potential of lycopene as a beneficial dietary supplement in improving metabolic health and reducing the risk of associated chronic diseases. The conditions described are population diseases, so research into compounds with properties such as lycopene is growing in popularity.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cell viability following exposure to varying lycopene concentrations was determined using an XTT assay. ELISA measured key cell death proteins (Bax, BCL-2, etc.), while immunofluorescence staining visualized LC3β (autophagy) and 8-oxo-dG (DNA damage). RESULTS: Lycopene significantly killed HeLa cells in a dose-dependent way (IC50 = 10 μM). Subsequent examinations conducted with the IC50 dose of lycopene demonstrated a notable elevation in the expression levels of apoptotic proteins, such as cleaved caspase 3, cleaved PARP, and Bax (p < 0.001). Additionally, treatment with this substance led to an increase in the levels of 8-oxo-dG (p < 0.001), a widely acknowledged biomarker indicative of oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore, a significant rise (p < 0.05) in LC3β protein levels, a well-established indicator of autophagy activation, was noted. CONCLUSION: This study suggests lycopene's potential to fight cervical cancer by triggering programmed cell death (apoptosis) and cellular self-digestion (autophagy). These findings highlight lycopene as a promising candidate for future cervical cancer treatments.",

      "abstract": "Common digestive precancerous lesions, including oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), gastric ulcers and colorectal adenoma, harbor high risk of cancerous transformation. Early intervention of these lesions is significant to prevent carcinogenesis and improve patients' prognosis. Lycopene, a carotenoid predominantly accumulated in tomatoes, is clinically recommended with its cis structure; as lycopene harbors the most potent antioxidative effects among carotenoids, its chemopreventive effects on the premalignant lesions is noted. Despite several reviews have assessed lycopene's efficacy for OPMDs, emerging studies have reported varying efficacy for digestive precancerous lesion with no comprehensive summary. Therefore, this review initially evaluates the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of lycopene for management of digestive precancerous lesions. According to the included studies, lycopene may show high promise in the management of digestive precancerous lesions, such as relieving mouth opening and burning sensation of oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), presenting potentially equivalent efficacy on managing oral lichen planus (OLP) as steroids and alleviating gastrointestinal precancers' symptoms, meanwhile lowering colon cancer risk. Moreover, its mechanisms for managing digestive precancerous lesions are concretely summarized, including anti-oxidative stress effects, anti-inflammatory response and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, especially its modifications on TLR4/TRIF/NF-κB signaling pathway and p53-dependent cell cycle control and apoptosis. More studies are warranted to confirm its long-term efficacy and preventive role against malignant transformation of digestive precancerous lesions as evidence is insufficient."

      "abstract": "Since the recycling of composites from plant tissues is difficult, extraction of bioactive compounds from plant sources requires pre-treatment by new technology such as pulsed electric fields (PEF). Due to the reduced consumption of organic solvents, the extractive techniques such as using supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) are of interest to researchers. This work aimed to investigating the influences of different parameters of SC-CO2 (pressure, modifier volume, temperature, and dynamic time) and PEF (frequency and field strength) treatments on the amount extraction of β-carotene, lycopene, lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, total phenol content (TPC), and also antioxidant activity percentage of tomato to obtain the optimum circumstances extraction via PEF and SC-CO2 methods. PEF data showed that treatments with moderate intensity (1 Hz and 0. 25 kV/cm) enhanced the extractability of lycopene (88%), β-carotene (69%), and β-cryptoxanthin (24%). The maximum recovery in total polyphenols was achieved at a 1 Hz and 1.75 kV/cm, leading to a 41.68% growth. The SC-CO2 results showed that extraction at 55°C and 35 MPa, and in a short time of 20 min (without any modifier: methanol) resulted in the highest levels of carotenoids (100% recovery), especially lycopene, and antioxidant activity. Largest value of total polyphenols was obtained at 35 MPa, 35°C, during 30 min, and 250 μL methanol as a modifier (58.79% recovery). Results showed that the extraction of polyphenols, unlike carotenoids, required a modifier. Organic solvents, often called modifiers, are sometimes added to the supercritical fluid to increase the polarity range of the extraction process and to help overcome analyte retention in the matrix. In this study, methanol was used as a modifier in different volumes. Therefore, the SC-CO2 gentle processing conditions, compared with PEF, improved the recovery of tomato bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to optimize such treatments."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrazine, a widely used herbicide, has become a major pollutant in agricultural water bodies. Pesticide contamination, including atrazine, is linked to a high incidence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting its neurotoxic potential. Lycopene, a potent antioxidant, is renowned for its diverse pharmacological effects, especially its neuroprotective properties. However, the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of lycopene and its impact on potential pathways against atrazine-induced hypothalamic damage have not been elucidated. PURPOSE: Our study aimed to elucidate how lycopene ameliorates hypothalamic injury triggered by atrazine exposure, with a special focus on the pluripotency of neural stem cells (NSCs) and pathways involved in cell senescence. METHODS: Mice were administered lycopene and/or atrazine via gavage for 21 days. The C17.2 NSC cell line and specific molecular inhibitors were utilized to examine the potential protective effects of lycopene in vitro. Morphological changes and ultrastructural damage in the hypothalamus were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The mechanisms of action of lycopene were explored through various methods, including senescence β-galactosidase staining, multiplex immunofluorescence, Western blotting and qRT‒PCR. RESULTS: Our results indicated that lycopene notably ameliorated atrazine-induced histological and ultrastructural damage, as well as the loss of intact and mature neurons in mouse hypothalami. Additionally, hypothalamic NSCs (HtNSCs) and microglia were recruited to areas of neuronal injury after atrazine exposure; intriguingly, lycopene treatment reduced this recruitment. Through in vivo and in vitro assays, we elucidated the outcomes of atrazine-induced HtNSC recruitment and neuronal loss, along with the neuroprotective mechanisms of lycopene. Mechanistically, lycopene prevents atrazine-induced senescence in HtNSCs and enhances their proliferation and differentiation by inhibiting the integrated stress response (ISR) signaling pathway, thus promoting the renewal of damaged neurons in the hypothalamus. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the results of the present study reveal, for the first time, that lycopene mitigates atrazine-induced HtNSC senescence by modulating the ISR signaling pathway. These findings offer novel insights into the role of lycopene in preventing and alleviating NSC senescence and suggest its potential development as a new therapy for neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Ponatinib is approved for use in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who are resistant to or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Given that ponatinib can induce significant cardiotoxicity when taken, and that most Chinese medicines have cardioprotective effects, it is possible to administer them in combination in clinic to alleviate adverse effects. The quantitative determination of ponatinib and its metabolite N-desmethyl ponatinib was optimized and fully verified by ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). And the drug-drug interactions (DDI) of ponatinib with lycopene and shikonin, both in vivo and in vitro, were studied. The results of bioanalytical methodology showed that ponatinib and N-desmethyl ponatinib had good linearity in plasma samples, and their selectivity, accuracy, precision, stability, matrix effect and recovery were all satisfied with the need of quantitative analysis of samples. In animal experiments, compared with the control group, lycopene and shikonin significantly changed the pharmacokinetic parameters of ponatinib, including AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞) and CLz/F, while having no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of N-desmethyl ponatinib. In vitro interaction studies indicated that lycopene showed mixed inhibition mechanism on ponatinib metabolism in both rat liver microsomes (RLM) and human liver microsomes (HLM). And, shikonin displayed mixed inhibition mechanism in RLM and competitive inhibition mechanism in HLM, respectively. In summary, the UPLC-MS/MS method can accurately and sensitively quantify ponatinib and N-desmethyl ponatinib, and provide further reference for clinical drug combination between ponatinib and lycopene or shikonin.",

Lycopene (LYC), a naturally occurring carotenoid, posses multiple health-promoting properties, including neuroprotective function. Here, the effects of LYC on memory and behavioral deficits induced by D-galactose (D-gal) treatment and the relative contribution of LYC-derived gut microbiota in these process were investigated. Results demonstrated that LYC showed effective protection on D-gal induced cognitive deficit and neuronal damage. Moreover, LYC treatment has beneficial effects on gut barrier damage, microbiota dysbiosis and levels of SCFAs in D-gal-induced subacute aging mice. Next, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment was performed and increased SCFAs were observed in mice received stools from D-gal+LYC group when compared with D-gal-FMT group. Thus, we added SCFAs treatment served as a control group in order to evaluated whether the alterations of gut-brain axis could be attributed to LYC-reshaped gut microbiota and SCFAs. Results showed that recipient mice received SCFAs and stools from D-gal+LYC group have similar beneficial effects in improving gut and brain function, demonstrated as: improved intestinal health via elevating antioxidant enzymes contents, increasing the expressions of tight junctions proteins and protecting gut barrier, enhanced mice working memory capacity via alleviating hippocampal neurons impairment, improving synaptic function and enhancing mitochondrial function in the intestinal pseudo-aseptic mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that LYC-derived microbiome played a pivotal role in the regulation of cognitive functions during aging and enhanced SCFAs formation might be an important signaling molecule connecting gut microbiome and brain.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reproductive performance is a crucial aspect of poultry production and is carefully controlled by endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine factors. This study aimed to investigate the effect of lycopene on testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells of laying breeder roosters, clarify the mechanism of lycopene improving Leydig cells function and promoting testosterone production, and explore the role of related signal transduction pathways in testosterone synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 96 healthy 55-week-old breeding roosters were randomly assigned to one of five dietary treatments. They were provided with a corn-soybean meal-based diet containing different levels of lycopene: 0 mg/kg (control), 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, or 200 mg/kg. The experiment lasted for 6 weeks. With the increase in lycopene levels, the testosterone content in the plasma was significantly higher than in the control group. Testicular Leydig cells were isolated and cultured from fresh testicular tissue of 45-wk-old to 60-wk-old breeding roosters. Various doses of lycopene were administered to Leydig cells, and subsequently, cells were collected for the detection of cell viability and testosterone content. The optimal concentration of lycopene to be added was determined, and changes in mRNA expression and protein levels of key proteins involved in testosterone synthesis were investigated. The results showed that lycopene treatment significantly increased testosterone secretion, mRNA expression, and protein levels of steroid-producing enzymes. Cells were collected to measure the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the mRNA transcription level of apoptotic factors, and the protein expression of apoptotic factors after treatment with lycopene. The results showed that lycopene significantly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and the ability to inhibit oxygen radicals, and decreased the content of malondialdehyde. Apoptosis was inhibited by regulating the expression of apoptosis-inducing and anti-apoptosis factors. After that, the MAPK signaling pathway and downstream SF-1, Nrf2 gene, and protein expression levels were detected. The results showed that lycopene treatment significantly increased the gene and protein expression of JNK, SF-1, and Nrf2, and significantly decreased the gene and protein expression of p38. CONCLUSIONS: Lycopene treatment could promote testosterone synthesis of testicular Leydig cells by activating MAPK-SF-1 (increasing steroid-producing enzyme level) and MAPK-Nrf2 pathways (resisting oxidative damage).",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of heat stress in poultry houses is inevitable and leads to oxidative stress in the birds. Lycopene, a natural hydrocarbon carotenoid, possesses potent antioxidant properties. This study aimed to investigate the impact of lycopene on growth performance, meat quality, cecal microflora, and liver metabolome in broilers subjected to heat stress. A total of 480 yellow feather broilers were randomly allocated into 4 treatment groups: birds fed standard diet (Con), birds fed standard diet and supplemented with lycopene (Lyc), birds fed standard diet and subjected to heat stress (Hs), and birds fed with lycopene and subjected to heat stress (Hs-Lyc). As compared with the normal temperature groups, Hs decreased the average daily gain (ADG) of birds during d 1 to 28, lowered the pH value either in breast meat or thigh meat, increased the L* value of breast meat, and decreased the a* value of thigh meat. In comparison with non-Lyc feeding birds, Lyc supplement elevated the ADG during d 1 to 56, increased the pH of breast meat, decrease the L* and b* values of thigh meat, simultaneously increase the a* value of thigh meat. The L* of breast meat and pH of thigh meat exhibited significant differences under Hs-Lyc treatment. Lyc-treated birds exhibited higher elasticity, gumminess, and resilience in breast meat than those in non-Lyc feeding birds. The cecal metagenome analysis indicated that Hs-Lyc treatment increased the abundance of Phocaeicola salanitronis and Prevotella sp.CAG:1058, Bacteroides sp.An269, and Bacteroides sp.An19 at the species level compared with other treatments. The hepatic untargeted metabolome analysis showed that administration of Lyc upregulated 20 metabolites and downregulated 60 metabolites compared to the Con birds. Futhermore, the Hs-Lyc treatment upregulated 34 metabolites and downregulated 45 metabolites compared to the Hs birds. The correlation between the metagenome and metabolome showed that Lyc supplementation induced significant alterations in the citrate cycle, metabolism of butanoate, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate compared with standard supplement. In contrast, Hs-Lyc treatment induced alterations in the citrate cycle, metabolism of pyruvate, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, arginine, proline, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate compared with the standard supplement of heat-challenged broilers. In summary, dietary Lyc supplementation promoted the growth performance, changed the meat quality, modulated the cecal metagenome and hepatic metabolome in heat-stressed broilers.",

      "abstract": "Brain function is linked with many peripheral tissues, including the liver, where hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) mediates communication between the liver and brain. Lycopene (LYC), a naturally occurring carotenoid, posses multiple health-promoting properties, including neuroprotective function. Here, we investigated the effects of LYC on age-related memory impairment and the relative contribution of liver-brain FGF21 signaling in these process. The results showed that after treatment with LYC for 3 months, brain aging and age-related cognitive deficits were effectively managed. In addition, LYC ameliorated neuronal degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage, and promoted synaptic vesicle fusion in 18-month-old mice. Notably, LYC activated liver-brain FGF21 signalling in aging mice. Whereas all these central effects of LYC were negated by blocking FGF21 via i. v. injection of adeno-associated virus in aging mice. Furthermore, recombinant FGF21 elevated mitochondrial ATP levels and enhanced synaptic vesicle fusion in mouse hippocampal HT-22 cells, which promoted neurotransmitter release. Additionally, we co-cultured hepatocytes and neurons in Transwell and found that LYC enhanced hepatocytes' support for neurons. This support included improved cell senescence, enhanced mitochondrial function, and increased axon length in co-cultured neurons. In conclusion, LYC protects against age-related cognitive deficit, partly explained by activating liver-brain FGF21 signalling, hence promoting neurotransmitters release via increasing mitochondrial ATP levels and enhancing synaptic vesicle fusion. These findings revealed that FGF21 could be a potential therapeutical target in nutritional intervention strategies to improve cognitive damage caused by aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Lycopene is a carotenoid highly valuable to the food, pharmaceutical, dye, and cosmetic industries, present in ripe tomatoes and other fruits with a distinctive red color. The main source of lycopene is tomato crops. This bioactive component can be successfully isolated from tomato processing waste, commonly called tomato pomace, mostly made from tomato skins, seeds, and some residual tomato tissue. The main investigative focus in this work was the application of green engineering principles in each stage of the optimized ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of enzymatically treated tomato skins to obtain functional extracts rich in lycopene. The experimental plan was designed to determine the influence of studied operating parameters: enzymatic reaction time (60, 120, and 180 min), extraction time (0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min), and temperature (25, 35 and 45 ℃) on lycopene yield. Process optimization was performed based on the yield of lycopene [1018, 1067, and 1120 mg/kg] achieved at optimal operating conditions. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed and trained for predictive modeling of the closed extraction system, with operating parameters used as input neurons and experimentally obtained values for lycopene content defined as the output neural layer. Applied ANN architecture provided a high correlation of experimental output with ANN-generated data (R=0.99914) with a model deviation error for the entire data set of RMSE=5.3 mg/kg. The k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm was introduced to predict lycopene yield using experimental key features: operating temperature, extraction time, and time of enzymatic treatment, split into training and testing sets with an 85/15 ratio. The model interpretation was conducted through the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) methodology.",

Lycopene (LYC) and Garcinia cambogia fruit extract (GE) might be important resources for anti-obesity drugs; therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-obesity effects of LYC and GE on 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Zucker rats. Mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were differentiated in mature adipocytes and then treated with LYC (0.5 μM), GE (30 mg/mL) or LYC + GE for 24 h. Moreover, male Zucker Crl:ZUC-Leprfa rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups of 10 animals to orally receive Vehicle (Ctrl), Orlistat (20 mg/kg), LYC (5 mg/kg), GE (1000 mg/kg) or LYC + GE for 28 days. LYC, GC extracts and even more LYC + GE stimulated the mRNA and protein expression of thermogenic genes UCP1, CIDEA and DIO2, significantly reduced lipid droplet size and increased lipid droplet number in adipocytes. UCP1 mRNA and protein expression was also increased in the visceral adipose tissue of the rats that received the dietary intake of LYC, GE and even more LYC + GE. Moreover, LYC + GE induced the reorganization of visceral fat depots that showed a great number of small adipocytes and a significant reduction in weight gain and food intake compared to the control group. The obtained results demonstrated that LYC + GE might be used as new approaches for obesity management in order to induce the browning process and achieve a metabolically active tissue instead of a tissue characterized by lipid depot accumulation."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of lycopene on renal damage caused by zearalenone (ZEN). Male Kunming mice were treated daily for 4 weeks by intragastric administration with 40 mg/kg ZEN in the presence or absence of lycopene (2.5 or 5 mg/kg). The results showed that lycopene markedly alleviated the damage of renal structure and function in mice induced by ZEN, as indicated by the reduced degree of pathological damage and the decreased levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine. Meanwhile, results of dihydroethidine (DHE) staining and biochemical markers revealed that ZEN exposure notably increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), decreased the level of GSH, and reduced the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Administration of lycopene alleviated the increased oxidative stress induced by ZEN. Moreover, ZEN ingestion notably resulted in apoptosis, increased the protein levels of BCL2 associated X protein (Bax) and cleaved caspase-3, and decreased the protein levels of apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (Bcl-2), which were reversed by lycopene intervention. Results of immunofluorescence demonstrated that lycopene reversed ZEN-induced the upregulation of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), Caspase-1, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in mice kidneys. Lycopene supplementation could alleviate ZEN-induced renal toxicity by inhibiting oxidative stress, apoptosis, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

The treatments included LED growth lights in three modes: top lighting, intra-canopy lighting, and combined top and intra-canopy lighting. The results showed that although the combined top and intra-canopy lighting reached the maximum increase in tomato yield, exposure to intra-canopy LED lighting alone outperformed in tomato fruit yield increase (28.46%) than exposure to top LED lighting alone (12.12%) when compared to no supplemental lighting during the entire production year. Intra-canopy exposure demonstrated the highest increase in tomato lycopene (31.3%), while top and intra-canopy lighting exhibited the highest increase in vitamin C content (123.4%) compared to the control. The LED light treatment also had a very positive effect on the expression of genes responsible for metabolic cycles, including Psy1, LCY-β, and VTC2 genes, which had collinearity with the increase in tomato fruit production.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the hydrolysates from orange peel waste (OPW) as the low-cost carbon source for lycopene production. Initially, the dilute acid pretreatment combined with enzymatic hydrolysis of OPW resulted in a total sugar concentration of 62.18 g/L. Meanwhile, a four-month adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiment using a d-galacturonic acid minimal medium resulted in an improvement in the growth rate of our previously engineered Escherichia coli strain for lycopene production. After evolutionary adaptation, response surface methodology (RSM) was adapted to optimize the medium composition in fermentation. The results obtained from RSM analysis revealed that the 5.53 % carbon source of orange peel hydrolysate (OPH), 6.57 g/L nitrogen source, and 30 °C temperature boosted lycopene production in the final strain. Subsequently, the optimized treatment for lycopene fermentation was then conducted in a 5 L batch fermenter under the surveillance of a kinetic model that uses the Logistic equation for strain growth (μm = 0.441 h-1), and Luedeking-Piret equations for lycopene production (Pm = 1043 mgL-1) with growth rate constant (α = 0.1491). At last, lycopene biosynthesized from OPH was extracted and analyzed for qualitative validation. Likewise, its data on phytic acid (between 1.01 % and 0.86 %) and DPPH radical scavenging (between 38.06 % and 29.08 %) highlighted the better antioxidant capacity of lycopene. In conclusion, the OPH can be used as a fermentation feedstock which opens new possibilities of exploiting fruit crop residues for food and pharmaceutical applications."

Specifically, 10% to 18% of the raw materials used in tomato processing become waste. This waste can seriously affect ecosystems, such as freshwater bodies, wetlands, rivers, and other natural environments, if not properly managed. Interestingly, tomato waste, specifically the skin, contains lycopene, a potent antioxidant and antimutagenic that offers a range of health benefits. This makes it a valuable ingredient in industries such as food and cosmetics. In addition, researchers are exploring the potential of lycopene in the treatment of various types of cancer. This systematic review, guided by the PRISMA 2020 methodology, examined studies exploring the possibility of tomato peel as a source of lycopene and carotenoids for cancer treatment. The findings suggest that tomato peel extracts exhibit promising anticancer properties, underscoring the need for further investigation of possible therapeutic applications. The compiled literature reveals significant potential for using tomato peel to create new cancer treatments, which could potentially revolutionize the field of oncology. This underscores the importance of continued research and exploration, emphasizing the urgency and importance of the scientific community's contribution to this promising area of study.",

Diabetic wounds are a major problem because they do not resolve in few days. Major problems affecting wound healing are infection, age, stress, etc. at the wound site, and other associated disease conditions. Lycopene is a red pigment obtained from various fruits such as tomatoes, watermelon, and guava. It is a powerful antioxidant that scavenges reactive oxygen species and potential as nutraceuticals. It has reported antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic, and antiaging activities based on the literature. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study is to find the wound-healing potential of lycopene emulgel (LE) and report the properties of the compound. METHODS: Wound healing activity was assessed in Streptozotocin induced diabetic rats and control rats. Streptozotocin injection (55 mg/kg) was used to induce marked hyperglycaemia, compared with controls. The formulation was applied topically and was evaluated for efficacy. RESULTS: Treatment of rats with lycopene emulgel (LE) topical application exhibited a significant reduction of wound closure of 95.3 and 88.9% and epithelisation within 21 days. CONCLUSION: The formulation was found to be novel, safe, and effective in the functional recovery of wounds."

      "abstract": "The malfunction of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) due to ox-LDL is a risk contributor for arteriosclerotic disease. Meanwhile, lycopene possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidative qualities. This investigation aimed to determine if lycopene can protect EPCs from ox-LDL-induced damage and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. The effects of lycopene on the survival, migration, and tube-forming capacity of EPCs were determined via in vitro assays. Expression of proteins related to pyroptosis and cellular proteins related to AMPK/mTOR/NLRP3 signaling was determined by western blot/flow cytometry. Our results demonstrated that lycopene treatment significantly enhanced proliferation, tube formation, and migration of EPCs stimulated by ox-LDL. Additionally, lycopene was found to suppress pyroptosis in ox-LDL-induced EPCs through the activation of AMPK, which led to the inhibition of mTOR phosphorylation and subsequent downregulation of the downstream NLRP3 inflammasome. In summary, our study suggests that lycopene mitigates ox-LDL-induced dysfunction in EPCs and inhibits pyroptosis via AMPK/mTOR/NLRP3 signaling. Our study suggests that lycopene may act as promising therapies for preventing atherosclerosis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biochemical events provoked by oxidative stress and advanced glycation may be inhibited by combining natural bioactives with classic therapeutic agents, which arise as strategies to mitigate diabetic complications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether lycopene combined with a reduced insulin dose is able to control glycemia and to oppose glycoxidative stress in kidneys of diabetic rats. METHODS: Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with 45 mg/kg lycopene + 1 U/day insulin for 30 days. The study assessed glycemia, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile and paraoxonase 1 (PON-1) activity in plasma. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and the protein levels of advanced glycation end-product receptor 1 (AGE-R1) and glyoxalase-1 (GLO-1) in the kidneys were also investigated. RESULTS: An effective glycemic control was achieved with lycopene plus insulin, which may be attributed to improvements in insulin sensitivity. The combined therapy decreased the dyslipidemia and increased the PON-1 activity. In the kidneys, lycopene plus insulin increased the activities of SOD and CAT and the levels of AGE-R1 and GLO-1, which may be contributing to the antialbuminuric effect. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that lycopene may aggregate favorable effects to insulin against diabetic complications resulting from glycoxidative stress.",

In this study, WPI-EGCG nanoparticles (WENPs) were developed for encapsulating lycopene (LYC) using the ultrasound-assisted method. The results indicated successful loading of LYC into these WENPs, forming the WENPs/LYC (cylinder with 200-300 nm in length and 14.81-30.05 nm in diameter). Encapsulating LYC in WENPs led to a notable decrease in release rate and improved stability in terms of thermal, ultraviolet (UV), and storage conditions compared to free LYC. Simultaneously, WENPs/LYC exhibited a synergistic and significantly higher antioxidant activity with an EC50 value of 23.98 μg/mL in HepG2 cells compared to free LYC's 31.54 μg/mL. Treatment with WENPs/LYC led to a dose-dependent restoration of intracellular antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px) and inhibition of intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis indicated that enrichment in glutathione metabolism and peroxisome processes following WENPs/LYC addition. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) verified the expression levels of related genes involved in the antioxidant resistance pathway of WENPs/LYC on AAPH-induced oxidative stress. This study offers novel perspectives into the antioxidant resistance pathway of WENPs/LYC, holding significant potential in food industry.",

      "abstract": "The 5-HT3 receptor and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression as their activation reduces serotonin contents in the brain. Since molecular docking analysis revealed lycopene as a potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and IDO1 inhibitor, we hypothesized that lycopene might disrupt the interplay between the 5-HT3 receptor and IDO1 to mitigate depression. In mice, the depression-like phenotypes were induced by inoculating Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Lycopene (intraperitoneal; i.p.) was administered alone or in combination with 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (i.p.) or IDO1 inhibitor minocycline (i.p.), and the behavioral screening was performed by the sucrose preference test, open field test, tail suspension test, and splash test which are based on the different principles. Further, the brains were subjected to the biochemical analysis of serotonin and its precursor tryptophan by the HPLC. The results showed depression-like behavior in BCG-inoculated mice, which was reversed by lycopene administration. Moreover, prior treatment with ondansetron or minocycline potentiated the antidepressant action of lycopene. Minocycline pretreatment also enhanced the antidepressant effect of ondansetron indicating the regulation of IDO1 activity by 5-HT3 receptor-triggered signaling. Biochemical analysis of brain samples revealed a drastic reduction in the levels of tryptophan and serotonin in depressed animals, which were restored following treatment with lycopene and its combination with ondansetron or minocycline. Taken together, the data from molecular docking, behavioral experiments, and biochemical estimation suggest that lycopene might block the 5-HT3 receptor and consequently inhibit the activity of IDO1 to ameliorate BCG-induced depression in mice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Carotenoids are fat-soluble phytochemicals with biological roles, including ultraviolet protective functions in skin. Spectroscopic skin carotenoid measurements can also serve as a noninvasive biomarker for carotenoid consumption. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in metabolic genes are associated with human plasma carotenoid concentrations; however, their relationships with skin carotenoid concentrations are unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between 13 candidate SNPs with skin and plasma carotenoid concentrations before and after a carotenoid-rich tomato juice intervention. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled trial, participants (n = 80) were provided with lycopene-rich vegetable juice providing low (13.1 mg), medium (23.9 mg), and high (31.0 mg) daily total carotenoid doses for 8 wk. Plasma carotenoid concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and skin carotenoid score was assessed by reflection spectroscopy (Veggie Meter) at baseline and the end-of-study time point. Thirteen candidate SNPs in 5 genes (BCO1, CD36, SCARB1, SETD7, and ABCA1) were genotyped from blood using PCR-based assays. Mixed models tested the effects of the intervention, study time point, interaction between intervention and study time point, and SNP genotype on skin and plasma carotenoids throughout the study. Baseline carotenoid intake, body mass index, gender, and age are covariates in all models. RESULTS: The genotype of CD36 rs1527479 (P = 0.0490) was significantly associated with skin carotenoid concentrations when baseline and the final week of the intervention were evaluated. Genotypes for BCO1 rs7500996 (P = 0.0067) and CD36 rs1527479 (P = 0.0018) were significant predictors of skin carotenoid concentrations in a combined SNP model. CONCLUSIONS: These novel associations between SNPs and skin carotenoid concentrations expand on the understanding of how genetic variation affects interindividual variation in skin carotenoid phenotypes in humans. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03202043.",

However, the action of lycopene (LYC), a strong natural antioxidant compound, on osteoporotic bone loss remains largely unknown. Here, we show that oral administration of LYC to OVX rats for 12 weeks reduced body weight gain, improved lipid metabolism, and preserved bone quality. In addition, LYC treatment inhibited ROS overgeneration in serum and bone marrow in OVX rats, and in BMSCs upon H2O2 stimulation, leading to inhibiting adipogenesis and promoting osteogenesis during bone remodeling. At the molecular level, LYC improved bone quality via an increase in the expressions of FoxO1 and Runx2 and a decrease in the expressions of PPARγ and C/EBPα in OVX rats and BMSCs. Collectively, these findings suggest that LYC attenuates osteoporotic bone loss through promoting osteogenesis and inhibiting adipogenesis via regulation of the FoxO1/PPARγ pathway driven by oxidative stress, presenting a novel strategy for osteoporosis management.",

      "abstract": "High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from in vitro conditions compromise oocyte quality and subsequent polyspermy prevention by the zona and membrane block. Antioxidant supplementation, like lycopene, during in vitro maturation (IVM) mitigates ROS effects, yet, its efficacy in blocking polyspermy remains uncertain. This study aims to evaluate the effect of lycopene supplementation during IVM on oocyte maturation, fertilization, and developmental parameters. To this end, bovine oocytes were supplemented with 0.2 µM lycopene and fertilized with semen from three bulls. The three bulls showed different fertilization potential in vitro, with bull 1 showing the highest penetration and polyspermy rates and the lowest in vitro fertilization (IVF) efficiency. Interestingly, in bull 1, the treatment with lycopene improved IVF efficiency (p = 0.043) and reduced the polyspermy rate (p = 0.028). However, none of these effects were observed in bulls 2 and 3. Bulls with higher penetration rates exhibited better blastocyst rates although those rates did not seem to be associated with polyspermy or IVF efficiency. Oocyte mitochondrial distribution and activity and cortical granule migration and distribution were not influenced by lycopene. In conclusion, we demonstrated that lycopene addition during oocyte maturation had a positive impact on IVF efficiency by reducing polyspermy rates in a bull-dependent manner. The reduction in polyspermy rates was not caused by changes in cortical granule migration or oocyte mitochondrial distribution. Lycopene must therefore induce other changes in the oocyte that lower the in vitro penetration rates of specific bulls prone to polyspermy.",

      "abstract": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) can induce severe clinical bovine mastitis, which is to blame for large losses experienced by dairy farms. Macrophage polarization into various states is in response to pathogen infections. Lycopene, a naturally occurring hydrocarbon carotenoid, relieved inflammation by controlling M1/M2 status of macrophages. Thus, we wanted to explore the effect of lycopene on polarization states of macrophages in E. coli-induced mastitis. Macrophages were cultivated with lycopene for 24, before E. coli inoculation for 6 h. Lycopene (0.5 μmol/L) significantly enhanced cell viabilities and significantly reduced lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in macrophages, whereas 2 and 3 μmol/L lycopene significantly enhanced LDH activities. Lycopene treatment significantly reduced the increase in LDH release, iNOS, CD86, TNF-α, IL-1β and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expressions in E. coli group. 0.5 μmol/L lycopene significantly increased E. coli-induced downregulation of CD206, arginase I (ARG1), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), chitinase 3-like 3 (YM1), PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p-mTOR, jumonji domain-containing protein-3 (JMJD3) and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) levels. Moreover, Ginkgolic acid C17:1 (a specific PTEN inhibitor), 740YPDGFR (a specific PI3K activator), SC79 (a specific AKT activator) or CHPG sodium salt (a specific NF-κB activator) significantly decreased CD206, AGR1, IDO and YM1 expressions in lycopene and E. coli-treated macrophages. Therefore, lycopene increased M2 macrophages via inhibiting NOTCH1-PI3K-mTOR-NF-κB-JMJD3-IRF4 pathway in response to E. coli infection in macrophages. These results contribute to revealing the pathogenesis of E. coli-caused bovine mastitis, providing the new angle of the prevention and management of mastitis.",

There are a lot of data supporting the importance of lycopene (LYC) in preventing cancer. The antitumor properties of the combination of sorafenib and lycopene were examined in this study. A viability test against MDA-MB-231 was used to assess the anticancer efficacy of sorafenib, lycopene, and their combination in vitro. Moreover, a cell cycle analysis and Annexin-V/PI double staining were performed by using flow cytometry. In addition, the protein level of JNK-1, ERK-1, Beclin-1, P38, and P53 of the MDA-MB-231 cell line was estimated using ELISA kits. In addition, mice with SEC were divided into four equal groups at random (n = 10) to investigate the possible processes underlying the in vivo antitumor effect. Group IV (SEC-SOR-LYC) received SOR (30 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and LYC (20 mg/kg/day, p.o.); Group I received the SEC control; Group II received SEC-SOR (30 mg/kg/day, p.o.); and Group III received SEC-LYC (20 mg/kg/day, p.o.). The findings demonstrated that the combination of sorafenib and lycopene was superior to sorafenib and lycopene alone in causing early cell cycle arrest, suppressing the viability of cancer cells, and increasing cell apoptosis and autophagy. Likewise, the combination of sorafenib and lycopene demonstrated inhibition of the levels of Bcl-2, Ki-67, VEGF, IL-1β, and TNF-α protein. Otherwise, the quantities of the proteins BAX, P53, and caspase 3 were amplified. Furthermore, the combined treatment led to a substantial increase in TNF-α, caspase 3, and VEGF gene expression compared to the equivalent dosages of monotherapy. The combination of sorafenib and lycopene enhanced apoptosis and reduced inflammation, as seen by the tumor's decreased weight and volume, hence demonstrating its potential anticancer effect."

      "abstract": "In this study, based on response surface optimization of ultrasound pre-treatment conditions for encapsulating lycopene, the corn starch-glycyrrhiza polysaccharide composite (US-CS-GP) was used to prepare a novel lycopene inclusion complex (US-CS-GP-Lyc). Ultrasound treatment (575 W, 25 kHz) at 35 °C for 25 min significantly enhanced the rheological and starch properties of US-CS-GP, facilitating the preparation of US-CS-GP-Lyc with an encapsulation efficiency of 76.12 ± 1.76 %. In addition, the crystalline structure, thermal properties, and microstructure of the obtained lycopene inclusion complex were significantly improved and showed excellent antioxidant activity and storage stability. The US-CS-GP-Lyc exhibited a V-type crystal structure, enhanced lycopene loading capacity, and reduced crystalline regions due to increased amorphous regions, as well as superior thermal properties, including a lower maximum thermal decomposition rate and a higher maximum decomposition temperature. Furthermore, its smooth surface with dense pores provides enhanced space and protection for lycopene loading. Moreover, the US-CS-GP-Lyc displayed the highest DPPH scavenging rate (92.20 %) and enhanced stability under light and prolonged storage. These findings indicate that ultrasonic pretreatment can boost electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonding between corn starch and glycyrrhiza polysaccharide, enhance composite properties, and improve lycopene encapsulation, which may provide a scientific basis for the application of ultrasound technology in the refined processing of starch-polysaccharides composite products.",

      "abstract": "Several mechanisms underlying nephrolithiasis, one of the most common urological diseases, involve calcium oxalate formation, including oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, fibrosis, pyroptosis, and apoptosis. Although lycopene has strong antioxidant activity, its protective effects against CaOx-induced injury have not yet been reported. This study aimed to systematically investigate the protective effects of lycopene and explore its mechanisms and molecular targets. Crystal deposition, renal function, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, fibrosis, pyroptosis, and apoptosis were assessed to evaluate the renoprotective effects of lycopene against crystal formation in a CaOx rat model and oxalate-stimulated NRK-52E and HK-2 cells. Lycopene markedly ameliorated crystal deposition, restored renal function, and suppressed kidney injury by reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and pyroptosis in the rats. In cell models, lycopene pretreatment reversed reactive oxygen species increase, apoptotic damage, intracellular lactate dehydrogenase release, cytotoxicity, pyroptosis, and extracellular matrix deposition. Network pharmacology and proteomic analyses were performed to identify lycopene target proteins under CaOx-exposed conditions, and the results showed that Trappc4 might be a pivotal target gene for lycopene, as identified by cellular thermal shift assay and surface plasmon resonance analyses. Based on molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, alanine scanning mutagenesis, and saturation mutagenesis, we observed that lycopene directly interacts with Trappc4 via hydrophobic bonds, which may be attributed to the PHE4 and PHE142 residues, preventing ERK1/2 or elevating AMPK signaling pathway phosphorylation events. In conclusion, lycopene might ameliorate oxalate-induced renal tubular epithelial cell injury via the Trappc4/ERK1/2/AMPK pathway, indicating its potential for the treatment of nephrolithiasis.",

The dual protective role of carotenoids without hydroxyl groups is important for both healthy skin and, in the authors' opinion, for the skin of chemotherapy-treated patients against the development of PPE, as the chemotherapy-induced reduction of the carotenoid concentration in the stratum corneum considerably weakens the skin resistance to cytotoxic and other adverse reactions.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Our preclinical studies showed that lycopene enhanced the anti-prostate cancer efficacy of docetaxel in animal models. A phase I trial (NCT0149519) was conducted to identify an optimum dose of synthetic lycopene in combination with docetaxel (and androgen blockade [androgen deprivation therapy, ADT]), and to evaluate its effect on the safety and pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in men with metastatic prostate cancer. METHODS: Subjects were treated with 21-day cycles of 75 mg/m2 docetaxel (and ADT), plus lycopene at 30, 90 or 150 mg/day. A Bayesian model averaging continual reassessment method was used to guide dose escalation. Pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and multiple correlative studies were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty-four participants were enrolled, 18 in a dose escalation cohort to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and six in a pharmacokinetic cohort. Docetaxel/ADT plus 150 mg/day synthetic lycopene resulted in dose-limiting toxicity (pulmonary embolus) in one out of 12 participants with an estimated probability of .106 and thus was chosen as the MTD. Lycopene increased the AUCinf and Cmax of plasma docetaxel by 9.5% and 15.1%, respectively. Correlative studies showed dose-related changes in circulating endothelial cells and vascular endothelial growth factor A, and reduction in insulin-like growth factor 1R phosphorylation, associated with lycopene therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of docetaxel/ADT and synthetic lycopene has low toxicity and favourable pharmacokinetics. The effects of lycopene on biomarkers provide additional support for the toxicity-dependent MTD definition. HIGHLIGHTS: The maximum tolerated dose was identified as 150 mg/day of lycopene in combination with docetaxel/ADT for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer patients. Small increases in plasma exposure to docetaxel were observed with lycopene co-administration. Mechanistically significant effects were seen on angiogenesis and insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling by lycopene co-administration with docetaxel/ADT.",

Lycopene (12 mg/kg BW) attenuated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, decreased the proportion of E. coli, and activated the NLR family pyrin domain containing 12 and inactivated nuclear factor kappa B pathways. Furthermore, lycopene inhibited the adhesion of E. coli O157:H7 to Caco-2 cells by blocking the interaction between E. coli O157:H7 and integrin β1. Lycopene ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by improving epithelial barrier functions and inhibiting E. coli adhesion.

The resistance of Plasmodium parasites to commonly used antimalarial drugs has necessitated the development of novel drugs and targets for malaria treatment. Lycopene is a natural compound present in tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables. This study aimed to evaluate the antimalarial activity of lycopene and its co-administration with chloroquine against chloroquine-resistant malaria, as well as to assess its impact on hematological abnormalities associated with malaria infection. The experimental animals for this study were infected with 10 7 NK65 Plasmodium berghei-infected red blood cells via intraperitoneal injection. The animals were then treated with artemether-lumefantrine, chloroquine, and varying doses of lycopene. The study evaluated percentage parasitemia, mean survival time, and various hematological parameters, including red blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width - coefficient of variation, red blood cell distribution width - standard deviation, white blood cell count, granulocyte count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, and procalcitonin level. The study revealed that lycopene demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) antimalarial activity and the ability to ameliorate hematological abnormalities associated with acute malaria infection. The findings of this study highlight the potential of lycopene as a novel antimalarial agent. The results of this study may contribute to the development of new drugs for malaria treatment, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.",

The heavy use of ATZ has caused serious environmental pollution and toxicity to human health. Lycopene (LYC), is a carotenoid that exhibits numerous health benefits, such as prevention of cardiovascular diseases and nephropathy. However, it remains unclear that whether ATZ causes cardiorenal injury or even cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) and the beneficial role of LYC on it. To test this hypothesis, mice were treated with LYC and/or ATZ for 21 days by oral gavage. This study demonstrated that ATZ exposure caused cardiorenal morphological alterations, and several inflammatory cell infiltrations mediated by activating NF-κB signaling pathways. Interestingly, dysregulation of MAPK signaling pathways and MAPK phosphorylation caused by ATZ have been implicated in cardiorenal diseases. ATZ exposure up-regulated cardiac and renal injury associated biomarkers levels that suggested the occurrence of CRS. However, these all changes were reverted, and the phenomenon of CAR was disappeared by LYC co-treatment. Based on our findings, we postulated a novel mechanism to elucidate pesticide-induced CRS and indicated that LYC can be a preventive and therapeutic agent for treating CRS by targeting MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways.",

Six further meta-analyses were performed, according to the follow-up of the studies (short-, medium- and long-term). Of the 339 studies identified, only 7 met the eligibility criteria. The meta-analysis of the studies according to the parameters evaluated only obtained statistical significance in the assessment of plaque index (p = 0.003). Regarding follow-up periods, PPD was significant (p = 0.03) in the short term. bleeding on probing estimates were significant in the short and medium term (p = 0.008 and p = 0.03, respectively), IP was significant in the short and medium term (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.01, respectively) and gingival index in the short and medium term (p = 0.002 and p = 0.02, respectively). Heterogeneity was high (I2 >50%) in all assessments, except for Clinical Attachment Loss (I2 = 16.7%).

During follow-up visits after 4<br />and 8 weeks, 20 ml of blood was collected for evaluation of liver enzymes and some inflammatory related markers.<br />Results: Prior to the assignment of volunteers to their respective groups, there were no notable differences in C-reactive<br />protein (CRP), serum liver enzymes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, or pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB)<br />between the Lycopene and placebo groups. However, our subsequent analysis revealed a significant reduction in the<br />serum levels of CRP (P=0.001) and PAB (P=0.004) in the group that received Lycopene. Our encapsulated Lycopene<br />treatment was not associated with a significant difference in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate<br />transferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) between our two groups.<br />Conclusion: This study investigated the impact of Lycopene on individuals with MetS, revealing a noteworthy<br />modulation effect on PAB and inflammation linked to MetS. However, no significant differences was demonstrated in<br />serum levels of ALT, AST and ALP between the studied group (registration number: IRCT20130507013263N3)."

The potential of tomato and tomato-derived product supplementation is supported by animal and in vitro studies. In addition, intervention studies provide arguments in favour of a limitation of metabolic inflammation. This is also the case for observational studies depicting inverse association between plasma lycopene levels and inflammation. Nevertheless, current data of intervention studies are mixed concerning the anti-inflammatory effect of tomato and tomato-derived products and are not in favour of an anti-inflammatory effect of pure lycopene in humans. From epidemiological to mechanistic studies, this review aims to identify limitations of the current knowledge and gaps that remain to be filled to improve our comprehension in contrasted anti-inflammatory effects of tomato, tomato-derived products and pure lycopene.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interplay between gut microbiota and heart, termed \"gut-heart\" axis, has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Our previous study showed that lycopene possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects, but its link to the gut microbiota is poorly understood. Herein, we surmised that lycopene could regulate the gut microbiota, exert anti-atherosclerotic effect by regulating the \"gut-heart\" axis. METHODS: Male ApoE-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without lycopene (0.1% w/w) for 19 weeks. Gut microbiota was analyzed by 16 S rRNA sequencing, the protein levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and phospho-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 were measured by Western blotting, the levels of serum inflammatory factors including monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were assayed using ELISA kits. Also, the concentrations of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), D-lactic acid (D-LA) and diamine peroxidase (DAO) were measured through ELISA method. RESULTS: The aortic sinus sections revealed that lycopene supplementation significantly reduced the extent of atherosclerotic lesions and inhibited atherosclerosis development caused by HFD. The analysis of gut microbiota showed that lycopene reduced the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroides and increased the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia, Akkermansia and Alloprevotella, which were related to elevated intestinal barrier function and reduced inflammation. Moreover, lycopene up-regulated the expression of intestinal ZO-1 and occludin and decreased serum LPS, D-LA and DAO levels. In addition, lycopene inhibited the expression of TLR4 and phospho-NF-κB p65 in aortic sinus plaque, serum MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels were also lowered by lycopene treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated the protective effect of lycopene against atherosclerosis induced by HFD and further revealed that its mechanism might be its prebiotic effect on maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis and improving intestinal barrier function, consequently reducing serum LPS-triggered inflammatory response in the heart."

      "abstract": "It has been found that high-lipid diets (HLDs) disrupt lipid metabolism in fish, leading to an excessive accumulation of lipids in various tissues of the fish body. The objective of this study was to investigate if the inclusion of lycopene (LCP) in an HLD may mitigate the adverse consequences of excessive dietary lipid intake in hybrid grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatus). The experimental design incorporated a control group (L0), which was administered a diet consisting of 42% protein and 16% lipid. The diets for groups L1, L2, and L3 were developed by augmenting the control diet with 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg LCP, respectively. The duration of the trial spanned a period of 42 days. The results of the study showed that the weight gain rate (WGR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) of the three LCP treatment groups (L1, L2, and L3) tended to increase and then decrease, with a significant increase in WGR and PER in L2 (P  < 0.05). Visceral somatic index and hepatic somatic index tended to decrease and then increase in all treatment groups, with a significant decrease in L2 (P  < 0.05). In serum dietary LCP significantly reduced triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) content and significantly increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) content (P  < 0.05). In the liver, dietary LCP reduced TC, TG, and very LDL levels and improved lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, fatty acid (FA) synthetase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activities. The number and area of hepatic lipid droplets decreased significantly with increasing LCP content. In the liver, the addition of appropriate levels of LCP significantly upregulated lipoprotein lipase (lpl) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (pparα). In summary, dietary LCP improves growth and reduces lipid deposition in the liver of hybrid grouper by increasing lipolytic metabolism and decreasing FA synthesis. Under the experimental conditions, the fitted curve analysis showed that the recommended LCP additions to the high lipid diet for juvenile hybrid grouper were 200-300 mg/kg."

In this context, High-Pressure Homogenization (HPH) presents a promising, easily scalable micronization technology, capable of enhancing the extractability and bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds found in tomato processing by-products, which are notably abundant waste streams in the Mediterranean region. This study focuses on optimizing HPH treatment parameters to intensify the recovery of bioactive compounds from tomato pomace. Additionally, it investigates the multifaceted impacts of HPH on various aspects, including color, particle size distribution, microscopic characteristics, surface properties, bioactivity, and lycopene bioaccessibility through in vitro digestion simulations. The results demonstrate that the application of HPH under optimized conditions (80 MPa, 25 °C, 10 passes) induces a remarkable 8-fold reduction in mean particle size, reduced surface tension, improved physical stability, uniform color, increased total phenolic content (+31%), antioxidant activity (+30%), dietary fiber content (+9%), and lycopene bioaccessibility during the intestinal digestion phase compared to untreated samples. These encouraging outcomes support the proposition of integrating HPH technology into an environmentally friendly industrial process for the full valorization of tomato processing residues. By utilizing water as the sole solvent, this approach aims to yield a functional ingredient characterized by greater nutritional and health-promoting values."

      "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is closely linked to impaired mitochondrial function and abnormal mitophagy. Biocompatible natural antioxidants effectively protect dopaminergic neurons. However, the main challenge in using natural antioxidants for Parkinson's disease therapy is creating a delivery platform to achieve neuron-targeted enrichment. Herein, we synthesized rationally sequence-targeted lycopene nanodots using recombinant human H-ferritin nanocages with lycopene loading into the cavity and lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) coupling on the outer surface. The nanodots allow for the neural enrichment and mitochondrial regulation of lycopene through blood-brain barrier transcytosis and neuronal mitochondria-targeting capability. These anti-ROS nanodots protect neuronal mitochondrial function and promote PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in MPTP toxicity-induced neurons in vivo and in vitro, which favors the secretory efflux of pathogenic α-synuclein and the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, these nanodots restore the Parkinson-like motor symptoms in Parkinson's model mice. This noninvasive sequence-targeted delivery strategy with excellent biocompatibility for pro-survival mitophagy-mediated pathology alleviation makes it a promising approach for treating and preventing Parkinson's disease.",

The ability to neutralize free radicals via lycopene is one of the foundations of its pro-health effect, including the ability to inhibit the development of many civilization diseases. Therefore, this study focuses on the importance of the antioxidant effect of lycopene in inhibiting the development of diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diseases within the nervous system, diabetes, liver diseases, and ulcerative colitis. According to the research mentioned, lycopene supplementation has significant promise for the treatment of illnesses marked by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. However, the majority of the supporting data for lycopene's health benefits comes from experimental research, whereas the evidence from clinical studies is both scarcer and less certain of any health benefits.

      "abstract": "Many natural substances commonly found in healthy diets have been studied for their potential to reduce male infertility associated with varicocele. A positive role of selenium (Se) or lycopene alone was demonstrated in experimental varicocele, while no data are available on their association. One group of male Sprague-Dawley rats was sham operated and daily treated with Se (3 mg/kg, i.p.), lycopene (1 mg/kg, i.p.), or their association. A second group underwent surgery to induce varicocele. Sham and half of the varicocele animals were sacrificed after twenty-eight days, while the residual animals were treated for one more month and then sacrificed. In varicocele animals, testosterone levels and testes weight were reduced, Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression was absent in the tubules and increased in Leydig cells, caspare-3 was increased, seminiferous epithelium showed evident structural changes, and many apoptotic germ cells were demonstrated with TUNEL assay. The treatment with lycopene or Se alone significantly increased testis weight and testosterone levels, reduced apoptosis and caspase-3 expression, improved the tubular organization, decreased HIF-1α positivity of Leydig cells, and restored its tubular positivity. Lycopene or Se association showed a better influence on all biochemical and morphological parameters. Therefore, the nutraceutical association of lycopene plus Se might be considered a possible therapeutic tool, together with surgery, in the treatment of male infertility. However, long-term experimental and clinical studies are necessary to evaluate sperm quantity and quality.",

METHODS: Male rats were randomly assigned to the control group, CCl4 group, and lycopene group. The CCl4 group was intraperitoneally injected with CCl4 twice per week for 12 weeks to induce hepatic fibrosis. The control group was intraperitoneally injected with olive oil. Lycopene was orally administered during CCl4 treatment. Body weight and liver weight were recorded. Liver function was assessed. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammatory factors were measured. Histological changes and collagen expression were evaluated. The expression of TGF-β1, α-SMA, HO-1, SIRT 1, REDD1, SHP2, P62, and LC3 in the liver was determined, as well as the levels of phosphorylated NF-κB and IκB α. RESULTS: Lycopene significantly reduced the liver/body weight ratio, and AST (P=0.001) and ALT levels (P=0.009). It also significantly increased CAT and SOD activities (P<0.001) and decreased MDA content (P<0.001), IL-6 (P<0.001), and TNF-α (P=0.001). Histological analysis demonstrated that lycopene improved lobular architecture and decreased collagen expression. It also decreased the expression of TGF-β1, α-SMA, P62, and SHP2, and increased the ratio of LC3 II/I, as well as Beclin 1 and REDD1 expression. In addition, it reduced NF-κB and IκB-α phosphorylation, and elevated the levels of HO-1, SIRT 1, and PGC 1α. CONCLUSION: Lycopene attenuates CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis because of its effect on autophagy by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.",

It is most commonly associated with red-colored fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, and papaya. Vitamin E encompasses a group of chemical compounds that share a structural relationship with alpha-tocopherol and are essential for the proper functioning of the human body. It is a fat-soluble vitamin and is known for its antioxidant properties. The aim of this study is to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of lycopene extract, vitamin E extract, and their combination against oral pathogens for their potential application in the treatment of oral diseases. Materials and methods The potential antimicrobial effects of extracts derived from lycopene, vitamin E, and their combination were evaluated against oral commensals like Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. Three concentrations (25 μl, 50 μl, and 100 μl) of the extract were tested. Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) and Rose Bengal agar (RBA) bases were utilized to determine the zone of inhibition. And the experiments were repeated in triplicate for each group. Results The identification and assessment of the antimicrobial activity of lycopene extract, vitamin E extract, and their combination revealed the greatest efficacy at the highest concentration (100 μl) against all tested microbial strains. Notably, C. albicans exhibited the highest susceptibility compared to the other strains. Vitamin E had the least antimicrobial effect and combination had the highest antimicrobial effect. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrated substantial antimicrobial activity of lycopene and vitamin E. These findings suggest that lycopene and vitamin E can be harnessed in the development of diverse drug formulations for the treatment of oral diseases."

In addition, pathology and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to examine the small intestine of mice. We found that lycopene decreased PPE-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IL-13 levels in the serum, relieved small intestine inflammation, attenuated the production of histamine and mouse mast cell protease-1, and downregulated PI3K and AKT1 expression in the small intestine tissues of mice allergic to peanuts.

Lycopene β-cyclase (LCYB) is a key enzyme involved directly in the synthesis of α-carotene and β-carotene through the cyclization of trans-lycopene. Daucus carota harbors two LCYB genes, of which DcLCYB2 (annotated as CCS-Like) is mostly expressed in mature storage roots, an organ that accumulates high α-carotene and β-carotene content. In this work, we determined that DcLCYB2 of the orange Nantes variety presents plastid localization and encodes for a functional LCYB enzyme determined by means of heterologous complementation in Escherichia coli. Also, ectopic expression of DcLCYB2 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa) plants increases total carotenoid content showing its functional role in plants. In addition, transgenic tobacco T2 homozygous plants showed better performance under chronic salt treatment, while kiwi transgenic calli also presented a higher survival rate under salt treatments than control calli.

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) is a prevalent hepatic disorder of global significance that can give rise to severe complications. This research endeavor delves into the potential of nano-liposomal formulated Lycopene (Lip-Lyco) in averting the development of obesity and insulin resistance, both of which are major underlying factors contributing to NAFL. The investigation further scrutinizes the impact of Lip-Lyco on intricate cellular pathways within the liver tissue of rats induced with NAFL, specifically focusing on the progression of steatosis and fibrosis. To establish an obesity-NAFL model, twenty rats were subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) for a duration of twelve weeks, after which they received an oral treatment of Lip-Lyco (10mg/kg) for an additional eight weeks. Another group of sixteen non-obese rats were subjected to treatment with or without Lip-Lyco, serving as a control for comparison. Results: The rats on a hypercaloric diet had high body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance, reflected in disturbed serum adipokines and lipid profiles. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis were evident in hepatic tissue, and the autophagic process in hepatocytes was inhibited. Additionally, the hedgehog pathway was activated in the liver tissue of NAFL group. Lip-Lyco was found to counteract all these aspects of NAFL pathogenesis. Lip-Lyco exhibited antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, antiapoptotic, autophagy-inducing, and Hedgehog signaling inhibitory effects. This study concludes that Lip-Lyco, a natural compound, has promising therapeutic potential in combating NAFLdisease. However, more experimental and clinical studies are required to confirm the effectiveness of lycopene in treating NAFLdisease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive urological disease occurring in middle-aged and elderly men, which can be characterized by the non-malignant overgrowth of stromal and epithelial cells in the transition zone of the prostate. Previous studies have demonstrated that lycopene can inhibit proliferation, while curcumin can strongly inhibit inflammation. This study aims to determine the inhibitory effect of the combination of lycopene and curcumin on BPH. METHOD: To induce BPH models in vitro and in vivo, the BPH-1 cell line and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used, respectively. Rats were divided into six groups and treated daily with a vehicle, lycopene (12.5 mg/kg), curcumin (2.4 mg/kg), a combination of lycopene and curcumin (12.5 mg/kg + 2.4 mg/kg) or finasteride (5 mg/kg). Histologic sections were examined via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry. Hormone and inflammatory indicators were detected via ELISA. Network pharmacology analysis was used to fully predict the therapeutic mechanism of the combination of lycopene and curcumin on BPH. RESULTS: Combination treatment significantly attenuated prostate hyperplasia, alleviated BPH pathological features and decreased the expression of Ki-67 in rats. The upregulation of the expression of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 5α-reductase, estradiol (E2) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in BPH rats was significantly blocked by the combination treatment. The expression levels of inflammatory factors including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were strongly inhibited by the combination treatment. From the network pharmacology analysis, it was found that the main targets for inhibiting BPH are AKT1, TNF, EGFR, STAT3 and PTGS2, which are enriched in pathways in cancer. CONCLUSION: The lycopene and curcumin combination is a potential and more effective agent to prevent or treat BPH.",

Lycopene is a natural carotenoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pharmacological effects, but the protective effects of lycopene against zearalenone-induced uterine damage have not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of lycopene treatment in early pregnancy on zearalenone-induced uterine damage and pregnancy impairment and its mechanism. Reproductive toxicity was induced by consecutive gavages of zearalenone at 5 mg/kg body weight during gestational days (GDs) 0-10 and in the presence or absence of oral administration of lycopene (20 mg/kg BW). The results showed that lycopene may alleviate zearalenone-induced pathological uterine histological damage and disturbances in oestradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone (P) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. Lycopene increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) production, providing protection against zearalenone-induced oxidative stress in the uterus. Additionally, lycopene significantly reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory factor interleukin 10 (IL-10), inhibiting the zearalenone-induced inflammatory response. In addition, lycopene improved the homeostasis of uterine cell proliferation and death via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. These data provide strong evidence that lycopene can be further developed into a potential new drug for the prevention or treatment of zearalenone-induced reproductive toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Lycopene is a type of carotenoid pigment widely distributed in various plants and fruits, with tomatoes, carrots, and guava being the most abundant sources. Due to its high content of beneficial active components, lycopene has been used in medicine, where it is employed as a dietary additive for cancer therapy, immune modulator, and feed additive to improve livestock productivity. Lycopene is a lipophilic substance that can act as either a prooxidant or a free radical scavenger and is particularly efficient in enhancing broiler performance. Furthermore, lycopene can alleviate heat stress by improving the activity of various antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT), as well as increasing the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and nuclear muscle factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), while simultaneously reducing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and muscle Keap1 expression. In addition, lycopene can improve broiler fertility by enhancing sperm performance and reducing inflammation by modulating the levels of interleukin 1, 2, and 10 (IL-1, IL-2, and IL-10) in cases of infection. In cases of disease by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), lycopene can modulate interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-1, claudin-1 (CLDN-1), and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Furthermore, under the lipopolysaccharide challenge, lycopene can increase the relative weights of immune organ indices such as the bursal, spleen, and thymus."

      "abstract": "Lycopene is a carotenoid with potential use in the treatment of chronic illnesses. Here, different formulations of lycopene were studied: lycopene-rich extract from red guava (LEG), purified lycopene from red guava (LPG) and a self-emulsifying drug delivery system loaded with LPG (nanoLPG). The effects of administering orally various doses of LEG to hypercholesterolemic hamsters were evaluated regarding the liver function of the animals. The cytotoxicity of LPG in Vero cells was analyzed by a crystal violet assay and by fluorescence microscopy. In addition, nanoLPG was employed in stability tests. LPG and nanoLPG were tested for their cytotoxic effect on human keratinocytes and antioxidant capacity on cells in an endothelial dysfunction model in an isolated rat aorta. Finally, the effect of different nanoLPG concentrations on the expression of immune-related genes (IL-10, TNF-α, COX-2 and IFN-γ) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using real-time PCR was also analyzed. Results suggest that LEG, despite not being able to improve blood markers indicative of liver function in hypercholesterolemic hamsters, reduced hepatic degenerative changes. Additionally, LPG did not show cytotoxicity in Vero cells. In relation to nanoLPG, the effects produced by heat stress evaluated by Dynamics Light Scattering (DLS) and visually were loss of color, texture change and phase separation after 15 days without interfering with the droplet size, so the formulation proved to be efficient in stabilizing the encapsulated lycopene. Although LPG and nanoLPG showed moderate toxicity to keratinocytes, which may be related to cell lineage characteristics, both revealed potent antioxidant activity. LPG and nanoLPG showed vasoprotective effects in aortic preparations. The gene expression assay indicates that, although no significant differences were observed in the expression of IL-10 and TNF-α, the PBMCs treated with nanoLPG showed a reduction in transcriptional levels of IFN-γ and an increased expression of COX-2. Thus, the work adds evidence to the safety of the use of lycopene by humans and shows that tested formulations, mainly nanoLPG due to its stability, stand out as promising and biosafe products for the treatment of diseases that have oxidative stress and inflammation in their etiopathology."

Lycopene (LYC) exhibits several beneficial properties for fish via enhance antioxidant defenses and improve immunity. In this study, we attempted to investigate the hepatotoxic effects of typical PHCZs 3, 6-dichlorocarbazole (3,6-DCCZ) and the protective mechanisms of LYC. In this study, we found that yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) exposure to 3,6-DCCZ (1.2 mg/L) resulted in hepatic inflammatory infiltration and disordered hepatocyte arrangement. Besides, we observed that 3,6-DCCZ exposure resulted in hepatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and excessive autophagosome accumulation, accompanied with inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. Subsequently, we confirmed that 3,6-DCCZ exposure triggered hepatic uncontrolled inflammatory response via activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, along with decreased plasma complement C3 (C3) and complement C4 (C4) levels. Meanwhile, yellow catfish exposed to 3,6-DCCZ exhibit an increased hepatic apoptosis phenomenon, as evidenced by the elevated number of positive TUNEL cells and upregulated expression of caspase3 and cytochrome C (CytC). In contrast, LYC treatment could alleviate the 3,6-DCCZ-induced pathological changes, hepatic ROS accumulation, autophagy, inflammatory response and apoptosis. To sum up, this study provided the demonstration that LYC exerts hepatoprotective effects to alleviate 3,6-DCCZ-induced liver damage by inihibiting ROS/PI3K-AKT/NF-κB signaling in yellow catfish.",

      "abstract": "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Various approaches have been used to present functional lipids including lycopene in a palatable food form to consumers. However, being highly hydrophobic, lycopene is insoluble in aqueous systems and has a limited bioavailability in the body. Lycopene nanodispersion is expected to improve the properties of lycopene, but its stability and bioaccessibility are also affected by emulsifier type and environmental conditions such as pH, ionic strength and temperature. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The influence of soy lecithin, sodium caseinate and soy lecithin/sodium caseinate at 1:1 ratio on the physicochemical properties and stability of lycopene nanodispersion prepared using the emulsification-evaporation methods before and after treatment at different pH, ionic strength and temperature were investigated. The in vitro bioaccessibility of the nanodispersions was also studied. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Under neutral pH conditions, nanodispersion stabilized with soy lecithin had the highest physical stability and the smallest particle size (78 nm), the lowest polydispersity index (PDI) value (0.180) and highest zeta potential (-64 mV) but the lowest lycopene concentration (1.826 mg/100 mL). Conversely, nanodispersion stabilized with sodium caseinate had the lowest physical stability. Combining the soy lecithin with sodium caseinate at 1:1 ratio resulted in a physically stable lycopene nanodispersion with the highest lycopene concentration (2.656 mg/100 mL). The lycopene nanodispersion produced by soy lecithin also had high physical stability under different pH range (pH=2-8) where the particle size, PDI and zeta potential remained fairly consistent. The nanodispersion containing sodium caseinate was unstable and droplet aggregation occurred when the pH was reduced close to the isoelectric point of sodium caseinate (pH=4-5). The particle size and PDI value of nanodispersion stabilized with soy lecithin and sodium caseinate mixture increased sharply when the NaCl concentration increased above 100 mM, while the soy lecithin and sodium caseinate counterparts were more stable. All of the nanodispersions showed good stability with respect to temperature changes (30-100 °C) except for the one stabilized by sodium caseinate, which exhibited an increased particle size when heated to above 60 °C. The combination of soy lecithin and sodium caseinate was found to increase the bioaccessibility of the lycopene nanodispersion. The physicochemical properties, stability and extent of the lycopene nanodispersion digestion highly depend on the emulsifier type. NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: Producing a nanodispersion is considered one of the best ways to overcome the poor water solubility, stability and bioavailability issues of lycopene. Currently, studies related to lycopene-fortified delivery systems, particularly in the form of nanodispersion, are still limited. The information obtained on the physicochemical properties, stability and bioaccessibility of lycopene nanodispersion is useful for the development of an effective delivery system for various functional lipids."

While dietary lycopene consumption contributes to protection against T2DM in animal studies, the potential mechanism of this compound in the regulation of islet function in T2DM remains largely unclear. In this study, by using anti-diabetic metformin as a positive control, we demonstrated that lycopene treatment suppressed islet inflammation and apoptosis in both high-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and in Min6 cells exposed to high glucose/palmitic acid (HG/PA)-RAW264.7 conditioned medium. Lycopene intervention resulted in M1/M2 macrophage polarization homeostasis, which is associated with increased insulin secretion, decreased fasting blood glucose levels, and improved lipid profiles in diabetic mice. Furthermore, the protective actions of lycopene were associated with the down-regulation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, which is positively related to inflammation in both diabetic mice and Min6 cells. Collectively, our findings indicated that lycopene ameliorates islet function and apoptosis and attenuates hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia by the regulation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. This study highlights dietary lycopene consumption as a novel strategy for the management of patients with diabetes.",

This study aimed to investigate whether the intervention with different concentrations of lycopene could attenuate H2O2-induced oxidative stress injury in human vascular endothelial cells (VECs). METHODS: The human VECs HMEC-1 and ECV-304 were incubated with a final concentration of 300 µmol/L H2O2, followed by they were incubated with lycopene at doses of 0.5, 1, or 2 µm. Subsequently, cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, cell adhesion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, adhesion molecule expression, oxidative stress levels, pro-inflammatory factor production, the apoptosis protein levels, and the silent information regulator-1 (SIRT1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway protein levels were tested by CCK-8 kit, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) kit, immunofluorescence labeling, cell surface enzyme immunoassays (EIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as well as Western blot assays, respectively. RESULTS: Under H2O2 stimulation, HMEC-1 and ECV-304 cell proliferation and the SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway protein expression were significantly reduced, whereas cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell adhesion molecule expression, pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress factors production were apparently encouraged, which were partially countered by lycopene intervention in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Lycopene alleviates H2O2-induced oxidative damage in human VECs by reducing intracellular ROS levels, inflammatory factor production, cell adhesiveness, and apoptosis rate under oxidative stress conditions through activation of the SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",

ICV Aβ1-42 administration was performed, followed by oral gavage of brain-targeted LME or conventional LOO formulation for 3 weeks. Brain samples were harvested for immunohistochemistry, biochemical assays and western blotting analyses. RESULTS: Our findings verified Aβ-induced neurotoxicity on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, Aβ metabolisms and synaptic plasticity. LME supplementation dramatically attenuated astrocytosis and microgliosis, decreased malondialdehyde production and rescued antioxidant capacities, normalized apoptotic parameters and alleviated neuronal loss, inhibited amyloidogenic processing and activated non-amyloidogenic pathway, together with upregulating synaptic protein expressions and restoring synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, most of these phenomena were not observed for mice treated with LOO, implying that LME showed significantly higher therapeutic efficacy against Aβ injury. DISCUSSION: In summary, brain-targeted LME could exert neuroprotective function via suppressing a series of cascades triggered by Aβ aggregates, thus ameliorating Aβ neurotoxicity and associated abnormalities. Given this, LME may serve as an attractive candidate for AD prevention and treatment, and superiority of brain-targeting delivery is highlighted.",

In this study, we examined the effects of two allicin (AL) and lycopene (LP) levels on performance index, a liver tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) gene expression, histological parameters of liver, and small intestine of V-line growing rabbits exposed to thermal stress. METHODS: In nine replications of three rabbits per pen under thermal stress, 135 male rabbits (5 weeks old, average weight 772.02 ± 6.41 g) were randomly allocated to five dietary treatments in nine replications of three rabbits per pen under thermal stress (temperature-humidity index average 31.2). The 1st group served as the control, receiving no supplements; The 2nd and 3rd groups received 100 and 200 mg AL/kg of diet supplements; and the 4th and 5th groups were supplemented with 100 and 200 mg LP/kg diet, respectively. RESULTS: show that AL and LP rabbits had the best final body weight, body gain, and feed conversion ratio compared with the control. compared with control, rabbit liver TNF- α levels significantly decreased in diets containing AL and LP In contrast, AL rabbits were slightly more effective in downregulating the expression of the TNF-α gene than LP groups. Furthermore, dietary supplementation of AL and LP significantly improved antibody titers against sheep red blood titers. Compared with other treatments, AL100 treatment significantly improved immune responses to phytohemagglutinin. In all treatments, histological analysis revealed a significant reduction in binuclear hepatocytes. The diameter of the hepatic lobules, villi height, crypt depth, and absorption surface of heat-stressed rabbits were all positively affected by both doses of LP (100-200 mg/kg diet). CONCLUSION: rabbit dietary supplementation with AL or LP could positively affect performance, TNF-α, immunity, and histological parameters of growing rabbits under thermal stress.",

However, the specific mechanism of DBP-induced testosterone synthesis inhibition and its effective intervention measures of prevention and treatment are scarce presently. Lycopene (LYC) plays beneficial roles in male infertility because of its antioxidant activity. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether LYC could prevent DBP-induced male reproductive toxicity. By in vitro and in vivo investigations, this study demonstrated that DBP activated ROS/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoted mitophagy and apoptosis, which in turn inhibited testosterone synthesis. Additionally, another major finding was that LYC supplement could reverse the above change, presenting as the restraint of ROS/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, reduction of mitophagy and apoptosis, and improvement of testosterone synthesis. Our study facilitates deeper understandings of the mechanism in DBP-induced testosterone synthesis inhibition, and identifies LYC as the effective prevention and control strategies for DBP poisoning.",

The α-helix and β-sheet percentage, surface hydrophobicity and fluorescence intensity of WPI decreased significantly (p < 0.05) upon binding. Both binary and ternary complexes enhanced the stability of the emulsions, and lycopene retained more after UV irradiation, thermal treatment, storage, compared with emulsions stabilized by WPI, with the best protection by both ternary complexes. In vitro simulated digestion results showed that free fatty acids were released in the order of WPI > WPI-HMP > WPI-CA > WPI-HMP-CA ≈ WPI-CA-HMP.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Male fertility can be hampered by systemic and testicular infections and inflammation, which can lead to impaired spermatogenesis that often cannot be reversed by antibiotic treatment. There has been some suggestion that lycopene (LYC) may be useful in the preservation of fertility, although its mechanisms are complex. This current study examined the therapeutic efficacy of LYC on testicular damage and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 5 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally to induce inflammation of the testes in mature male rats. The rats in the experimental group were administered 5 mg/kg LYC intragastrically for 4 weeks. The testes were harvested from the euthanized rats for lipidomics, RNA sequencing, and related experimental tests. RESULTS: Laboratory data suggested that LPS-induced systemic inflammation induced cytokine excess and oxidative stress in the testes. Administration of oral LYC inhibited the excess cytokine production and oxidative stress, mitigating damage to the testes. Lipidomic studies identified significant changes to 258 lipids and 5 metabolism pathways. Coupled with RNA sequencing analysis, 1,116 genes were found to be significantly regulated and many lipid metabolism-related signaling pathways were identified. The expression of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR) in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway was significantly upregulated after LYC treatment, which activated the RXR/PPAR easy dimer. The expression of downstream genes such as fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) was increased. These genes are involved in the control of fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, fatty acid chain elongation, and lipid metabolism, which partially explains the changes in the content and composition of lipids. CONCLUSIONS: LYC regulates the lipid metabolism of testes and lipid metabolism-related signaling pathways, such as the PPAR signaling pathway. Furthermore, LYC ameliorated the LPS-induced dysregulation of lipid metabolism in the testes, as well as the LPS-induced inflammatory response. This study offers a new perspective for the investigation of the mechanisms in inflammatory testicular damage and potential therapeutic targets."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins and carotenoids are phytochemicals that may benefit health through provitamin A carotenoid (PAC), antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. These bioactives may mitigate chronic diseases. Consumption of multiple phytochemicals may impact bioactivity in synergistic or antagonistic manners. OBJECTIVES: Two studies in weanling male Mongolian gerbils assessed the relative bioefficacy of β-carotene equivalents (BCEs) to vitamin A (VA) with simultaneous consumption of the non-PAC lycopene or anthocyanins from multicolored carrots. METHODS: After 3-wk VA depletion, 5-6 gerbils were killed as baseline groups. The remaining gerbils were divided into 4 carrot treatment groups; the positive control group received retinyl acetate and the negative control group was given vehicle soybean oil (n = 10/group; n = 60/study). In the lycopene study, gerbils consumed feed varying in lycopene sourced from red carrots. In the anthocyanin study, gerbils consumed feed varying in anthocyanin content sourced from purple-red carrots, and positive controls received lycopene. Treatment feeds had equalized BCEs: 5.59 ± 0.96 μg/g (lycopene study) and 7.02 ± 0.39 μg/g (anthocyanin study). Controls consumed feeds without pigments. Serum, liver, and lung samples were analyzed for retinol and carotenoid concentrations using HPLC. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's studentized range test. RESULTS: In the lycopene study, liver VA did not differ between groups (0.11 ± 0.07 μmol/g) indicating no effect of varying lycopene content. In the anthocyanin study, liver VA concentrations in the medium-to-high (0.22 ± 0.14 μmol/g) and medium-to-low anthocyanin (0.25 ± 0.07 μmol/g) groups were higher than the negative control (0.11 ± 0.07 μmol/g) (P < 0.05). All treatment groups maintained baseline VA concentrations (0.23 ± 0.06 μmol/g). Combining studies, serum retinol had 12% sensitivity to predict VA deficiency, defined as 0.7 μmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: These gerbil studies suggested that simultaneous consumption of carotenoids and anthocyanins does not impact relative BCE bioefficacy. Breeding carrots for enhanced pigments to improve dietary intake should continue.",

Lycopene, a natural carotenoid, has potent antioxidant activity and anti-cancer effects against several types of cancers. However, the mechanism for the anti-gastric cancer effects of lycopene remains to be fully clarified. Normal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 and gastric cancer cell line AGS, SGC-7901, Hs746T cells were treated with different concentrations of lycopene and the effects of lycopene were compared. Lycopene specifically suppressed cell growth monitored by Real-Time Cell Analyzer, induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis detected by flow cytometry, and lowered mitochondrial membrane potentials assessed by JC-1 staining of AGS and SGC-7901 cells, while did not affect those of GES-1 cells. Lycopene did not affect the cell growth of Hs746T cells harboring TP53 mutation. Further bioinformatics analysis predicted 57 genes with up-regulated expression levels in gastric cancer and decreased function in cells after lycopene treatment. Quantitative PCR and Western Blot were used to check the critical factors in the cell cycle and apoptosis signaling pathway. Lycopene decreased the high expression levels of CCNE1 and increased the levels of TP53 in AGS and SGC-7901 cells without affecting those in GES-1 cells. In summary, lycopene could effectively suppress gastric cancer cells with CCNE1-amplification, which could be a promising target therapy reagent for gastric cancer.",

As a carotenoid, lycopene has a strong anti-oxidative function. This research investigated the function of lycopene in the pelvic venous congestion (PC) rat model and the underlying molecular mechanism. Lycopene and olive oil were administered intragastrically on a daily basis for 4 weeks after successful modeling. Locomotor activity, voiding behavior, and continuous cystometry were analyzed. The levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), nitrate and nitrite (NO x ), and creatinine in the urine were measured. Gene expression in the bladder wall was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot. Locomotor activity, single voided volume, the interval between the bladder contractions, and urinary NO x /cre ratio were all decreased in rats with PC, while the frequency of urination, urinary 8-OHdG/cre ratio, inflammatory responses, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signal activity were all increased. Lycopene treatment increased locomotor activity, decreased frequency of urination, elevated urinary NO x level, and decreased urinary 8-OHdG level in the PC rat model. Lycopene also inhibited PC-enhanced pro-inflammatory mediator expression and NF-κB signaling pathway activity. In conclusion, lycopene treatment ameliorates PC-induced phenotypes and shows an anti-inflammatory effect in the PC rat model."

The FTIR results illustrated that hemicelluloses and lignin were completely removed from the pomelo peel cellulose substrate. The obtained CNFs and CNCs possessed a uniform morphology and nanoscale particle size. The stability of CNF-based Pickering emulsions was higher than that of emulsions stabilized with CNCs, due to the formation of gel structure induced by the CNFs' longer fibrils. Increased oil fractions enhanced the viscoelasticity of CNF-based Pickering emulsions. The in vitro digestion results suggested that increased oil fractions decreased the lipolysis degree, as a result of the larger droplet size and higher viscoelasticity of emulsion. The release of lycopene showed a trend similar to that of FFA release, suggesting that higher oil fractions were beneficial for controlling lycopene release during gastrointestinal digestion.",

This comprehensive review aims to highlight the in vivo and in vitro research evaluating the anticancer mechanisms of lycopene by underlining the experiment conditions. In addition to these, the general characterization of lycopene has been explained. A collection of relevant scientific pharmacological articles from the following databases PubMed/MedLine, Web of Science, Scopus, TRIP database, and Google Scholar on the mechanisms of anticancer molecular action and cellular effects of lycopene in various types of tumors was performed. The anticancer potential of lycopene has been described by various in vitro cells, animal studies, and some clinical trials. It has been revealed that the anticancer potential of lycopene is mainly due to its powerful singlet-oxygen quencher characteristics, simulation of detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes production, initiation of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression as well as modulations of gap junctional communication, the growth factors, and signal transduction pathways. It has been highlighted that the anticancer properties of lycopene are primarily linked to factors including; dose, presence of drug delivery systems, type of cancer, tumor size, and treatment time.",

Lycopene samples containing 5%, 30%, and 55% Z-isomers were successfully prepared by using thermal treatment combined with anti-solvent crystallization. The in vitro bio-accessibility of lycopene was estimated by the determination of partition factor (PF) and the results showed that lycopene with 55% Z-isomers possessed the highest bio-accessibility. Moreover, DPPH and ABTS assays suggested that the antioxidant activity of lycopene increased with the Z-isomers content from 5% to 55%. However, lycopene inhibited the survival of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) in a dose and time-dependent manner. The highest inhibition of HepG2 cell lines was achieved by 55% Z-ratio of lycopene. The cell viability was 22.54% at 20 μg/mL after incubating for 24 h, the number of cells was significantly reduced and the morphology was shrunk. Furthermore, molecular docking was introduced to compare the binding ability between different lycopene isomers with Scavenger Receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and the results revealed that the affinity of (all-E)-lycopene with SR-BI was lower compared to 5Z-lycopene and 13Z-lycopene, providing the reasons for different bioavailability of the above-mentioned lycopene isomers. All the above results demonstrated that Z-isomers-rich lycopene could enhance bio-accessibility and biological functionality."

Lycopene (LYC) is an anti-oxidative phytochemical that normalizes health hazards triggered by environmental factors. In this study, we aimed to investigate the toxic effects of ATR on the hippocampus and its amelioration by LYC. Male mice were exposed to ATR (50 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/d) and/or LYC (5 mg/kg/d) for 21 days. The results showed that ATR exposure induced hippocampus-dependent learning and memory impairments. ATR-induced ferroptosis in hippocampal cells affects the homeostasis of lipid metabolism, whereas LYC ameliorates the neurotoxic effects of ATR in the hippocampus. LYC inhibited ATR-induced ferroptosis by increasing the expression of HO-1, Nrf2 and SLC7A11. Therefore, this study established that LYC ameliorates ATR-induced spatial learning and memory impairments by inhibiting ferroptosis in the hippocampus and also provides a novel approach for the treatment in contradiction of environmental pollutants.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In pig production, early and abrupt weaning frequently causes weaning stress, which manifests as oxidative damage, barrier disruption, and digestion and absorption capacity declines. Lycopene exhibits beneficial antioxidant capacity in both humans and other animal models. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of lycopene supplementation on early weaning stress in piglets and the underlying mechanisms by examining the oxidative stress state, gut intestinal barrier function, and the gut microbiota. METHODS: Twenty-four 21-day-old weaned piglets [Duroc × (Landrace × Yorkshire); castrated males; 5.48 ± 0.10 kg initial body weight] were randomly assigned to 2 treatments. The piglets were fed a basal diet (control treatment) or a basal diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg lycopene (lycopene treatment) for 28 days. The serum lipid levels, serum and jejunum enzyme activities, jejunum morphology, mRNA and protein expression, and gut microbiota were determined. RESULTS: Compared with the control treatment, lycopene supplementation increased the serum catalase activity (P = 0.042; 62.0%); serum total cholesterol concentration (P = 0.020; 14.1%); and jejunum superoxide dismutase activity (P = 0.032; 21.4%), whereas it decreased serum (P = 0.039, 23.0%) and jejunum (P = 0.047; 20.9%) hydrogen peroxide concentrations. Additionally, lycopene increased the mRNA and protein expression of NFE2-like bZIP transcription factor 2 (214.0% and 102.4%, respectively) and CD36 (100.8% and 145.2%, respectively) in the jejunum, whereas it decreased the mRNA and protein expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (55.6% and 39.8%, respectively ). Lycopene also improved jejunal morphology, increasing the villus height (P = 0.018; 27.5%) and villus:crypt ratio (P < 0.001; 57.9%). Furthermore, it increased the abundances of potentially beneficial bacterial groups, including Phascolarctobacterium and Parasutterella, and decreased those of potentially pathogenic bacterial groups, including Treponema_2 and Prevotellaceae_unclassified. CONCLUSIONS: Lycopene supplementation strengthens the intestinal barrier function and improves the gut microbiota in weaned piglets by regulating intestinal antioxidant signaling.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, lycopene has been highlighted due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, associated with a beneficial effect on human health. The aim of this study was to advance the studies of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms on human keratinocytes cells (HaCaT) of a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) loaded with lycopene purified from red guava (nanoLPG). The characteristics of nanoLPG were a hydrodynamic diameter of 205 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.21 and a zeta potential of -20.57, providing physical stability for the nanosystem. NanoLPG demonstrated antioxidant capacity, as shown using the ORAC methodology, and prevented DNA degradation (DNA agarose). Proinflammatory activity was evaluated by quantifying the cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8, with only IL-8 showing a significant increase (p < 0.0001). NanoLPG showed greater inhibition of the tyrosinase and elastase enzymes, involved in the skin aging process, compared to purified lycopene (LPG). In vitro treatment for 24 h with 5.0 µg/mL of nanoLPG did not affect the viability of HaCaT cells. The ultrastructure of HaCaT cells demonstrated the maintenance of morphology. This contrasts with endoplasmic reticulum stresses and autophagic vacuoles when treated with LPG after stimulation or not with LPS. Therefore, the use of lycopene in a nanoemulsion may be beneficial in strategies and products associated with skin health.",

      "abstract": "Almost half of prostate cancer (PC) patients receive radiation therapy as primary curative treatment. In spite of advances in our understanding of both nutrition and the genomics of prostate cancer, studies on the effects of nutrients on the radiation sensitivity of PC patients are lacking. We tested the hypothesis that low plasma levels of selenium and lycopene have detrimental effects on ionising radiation-induced DNA damage in prostate cancer patients relative to healthy individuals. The present study was performed in 106 PC patients and 132 age-matched controls. We found that the radiation-induced micronucleus (MN) and nuclear buds (NBuds) frequencies were significantly higher in PC patients with low selenium (p = 0.008 and p = 0.0006 respectively) or low lycopene (p = 0.007 and p = 0.0006 respectively) levels compared to the controls. The frequency of NBuds was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in PC patients who had low levels of both selenium and lycopene compared to (i) controls with low levels of both selenium and lycopene and (ii) PC patients with high levels of both selenium and lycopene (p = 0.0001). Our results support the hypothesis that low selenium and lycopene levels increase the sensitivity to radiation-induced DNA damage and suggest that nutrition-based treatment strategies are important to minimise the DNA-damaging effects in PC patients receiving radiotherapy."

      "abstract": "Lycopene, a potential bioactive agent, is a non-pro-vitamin A carotenoid recognized as a potent antioxidant. It is extracted from plants like tomatoes, watermelons, red carrots and papayas and has remarkable health benefits. A significant amount of research has been assisted to date to establish the anticancer activity of lycopene. Our review enhances information about the promising anticancer potential of this compound. The biological activity of lycopene has been described in several studies in regard to pancreatic, breast, prostate, liver, gastric, ovarian, kidney, skin, intestine, brain and spinal cord cancers. Lycopene resists cancer by inhibition of apoptosis, induction of cell proliferation, cell invasion, cell cycle development, metastasis and angiogenesis. The mechanisms of anticancer action of lycopene are attributed to the management of certain signal transduction pathways, such as modulation of insulin-like growth factors system, PI3K/Akt pathway, modification of important gene expression, inhibit the activity of sex steroid hormones, and the conversation of mitochondrial behavior. Hence, this review focuses on current knowledge of sources, extraction techniques, and chemistry of lycopene, as well as the prospective mechanisms of action related with its anticancer activity. Also, it summarizes the background information about lycopene and the most current research with consideration to its aspect in treating several types of cancer together with future directions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity-related heart failure is exacerbated by excessive intake of saturated fats such as palmitate (PA). Lycopene (LYC) possesses anti-lipidemic, antioxidant, cytoprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects. This study, therefore, evaluated the impact of LYC against PA-invoked cardiotoxicity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-six female rats were equally divided into six groups: control; PA (5 mM); PA + LYC (24 mg/kg); PA + LYC (48 mg/kg); LYC (24 mg/kg); and LYC (48 mg/kg). The PA was administered five times weekly for seven weeks, while the LYC was given for the last two weeks. Lipids in the blood and the heart were estimated, as were oxidative stress and antioxidant indices, cardiac function, inflammation, and histology. Palmitate overload occasioned a significant (p < 0.05) increase in cardiac cholesterol (50%), phospholipids (19%), and non-esterified fatty acids (40%). However, triglyceride levels decreased (38%). Furthermore, malondialdehyde (45%), hydrogen peroxide (33%) levels and myeloperoxidase activity increased (79%). Also, cardiac gamma-glutamyl transferase (50%), serum creatine kinase activities (1.34 folds), NF-kB, interleukin1β, and interleukin-6 mRNA expression increased in the PA group relative to the control. In contrast, reduced glutathione (13%) and nitric oxide levels (22%), interleukin-10 mRNA expression, cardiac creatine kinase (35%), lactate dehydrogenase (33%), aspartate, and alanine transaminase activities decreased markedly (15- and 10%, respectively). Also, PA caused hyperemia, congestion of the cardiac interstitium, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. However, treatment with LYC reversed the features of cardiotoxicity and histological complications caused by PA. These observations are likely because LYC has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cytoprotective properties. CONCLUSION: Thus, LYC might be an appropriate remedy to manage PA-induced cardiotoxicity in female rats.",

This review aims to summarize the protective effect of tomato and lycopene on skin photo damage and skin photoaging in healthy subjects by reviewing the existing population intervention experiments. A total of five electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched from inceptions to January 2021 without any restriction. Out of 19336 publications identified, 21 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were meta-analysis. Overall, interventions supplementing tomato and lycopene were associated with significant reductions in Δa*, MMP-1, ICAM-1 and skin pigmentation; while tomato and lycopene supplementation were associated with significant increase in MED, skin thickness and skin density. Based on the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis, supplementation with tomato and lycopene could reduce skin erythema formation and improve the appearance and pigmentation of the skin, thereby preventing light-induced skin photodamage and skin photoaging. Lycopene-rich products could be used as endogenous sun protection and may be a potential nutraceutical for sun protection.",

      "abstract": "Malaria is a disease that affects thousands of people around the world every year. Its pathogenesis is associated with the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and lower levels of micronutrients and antioxidants. Patients under drug treatment have high levels of oxidative stress biomarkers in the body tissues, which limits the use of these drugs. Therefore, several studies have suggested that RONS inhibition may represent an adjuvant therapeutic strategy in the treatment of these patients by increasing the antioxidant capacity of the host. In this sense, supplementation with antioxidant compounds such as zinc, selenium, and vitamins A, C, and E has been suggested as part of the treatment. Among dietary antioxidants, lycopene is the most powerful antioxidant among the main carotenoids. This review aimed to describe the main mechanisms inducing oxidative stress during malaria, highlighting the production of RONS as a defense mechanism against the infection induced by the ischemia-reperfusion syndrome, the metabolism of the parasite, and the metabolism of antimalarial drugs. Furthermore, the effects of lycopene on several diseases in which oxidative stress is implicated as a cause are outlined, providing information about its mechanism of action, and providing an evidence-based justification for its supplementation in malaria.",
