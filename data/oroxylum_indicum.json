      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, which trigger oxidative stress and neuronal cell death. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of Oroxylum indicum (L.) leaf (OIL) extract against Aβ-induced oxidative stress and cellular damage in SH-SY5Y cells. The cells were treated with OIL extract with and without Aβ25-35, and their viability was investigated. Moreover, the mechanism of action of OIL was assessed by determining caspase-3 levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), and expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) proteins. The results indicated that OIL reduced Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner, improving cell viability, reducing ROS levels and MDA production, increasing antioxidant enzyme activity of CAT, SOD, and GSH-Px, and decreasing caspase-3 expression. In addition, OIL enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and CREB and upregulated Bcl-2 protein expression. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis identified oroxylin A, baicalein, and chrysin as the major phenolic constituents of the OIL extract. The findings suggest that the extract holds promise as a therapeutic intervention against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, offering potential implications for the treatment of AD. Further studies are needed to investigate the activity of OIL in primary neurons or in vivo.",

      "abstract": "Oroxylum indicum possesses promising flavonoid secondary metabolites. However, translation of these compounds into clinical practice for neurological disease treatment is halted as the toxicity and safety profile of the plant extracts are yet to be determined. This study was conducted to assess the acute oral toxicity and subacute neurotoxicity that could be imposed by the flavonoid-enriched fraction (FEF) extracted from O. indicum leaves, by strictly following the procedures set in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines No.420 and 424. It was found that at the highest dosage (2000 mg/kg b.wt), no death or toxicity-related behavioral changes were observed. No significant alteration in hematological and serum biochemical parameters beyond the standard laboratory range was observed. Detailed histopathological examination, as verified by clinical pathologist, revealed absence of detectable inflammation, changes in any macroscopic and microscopic tissue abnormalities in all vital organ of the treated rats. Moreover, neurological functional test of rats treated with repeated doses of FEF for 28 d also showed absence of neurological abnormality, suggesting negative long term side effects of this fraction on the animal. In conclusion, this study presented valuable pre-clinical safety validation of a high-quality herbal medicinal product, setting the foundation for its future application in clinical setting."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the number of new cancer cases increases every year, there is a necessity to develop new drugs for the treatment of different types of cancers. Plants' resources are considered to be huge reservoirs for therapeutic agents in nature. Among all the medicinal plants, Oroxylum indicum is one of the most widely used medicinal plants in India, China, and Southeast Asian countries. Combinatorial drug treatment, on the other hand, is favored over single drug treatment in order to target multiple biomolecular moieties that help in the growth and development of cancer. Therefore, combinatorial drug treatment using a co-crystal of multiple drugs gives researchers an idea of the development of a new type of drug for targeting multiple targets. In this study, a new co-crystal of chrysin and oroxylin A was isolated from the leaves of O. indicum, and its anticancer properties were studied in cervical cancer cells HeLa. AIM: This study was conducted with the aim of identifying new anticancer compounds from the leaves of Oroxylum indicum and studying the anticancer properties of the isolated compound. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we elucidated the structure of a new co-crystal compound, which was isolated from the leaf extract of Oroxylum indicum. The apoptosis induction mechanism of the newly discovered co-crystal in HeLa cells was also studied. METHODS: A crystal compound from the chloroform extract of leaves of Oroxylum Indicum was isolated by solvent fractionation and chromatographic methods involving HPLC. The molecular structure of the isolated crystal was elucidated by Single Crystal-XRD, FT-IR analysis, and further determined by LC-MS. The antiproliferative activity was carried out using an MTT assay and fluorescence microscopy, and the mechanism of apoptosis was determined using Western blotting techniques. RESULTS: The novel co-crystal consists of two active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in a 1:1 ratio, i.e., oroxylin A and chrysin. The isolated new co-crystal induced death in HeLa cells with a very low IC50 value of 8.49μM. It induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cells by activation of Caspase-3 through inhibition of ERKs and activation of p38 of MAPK cell signalling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study presents the first report on the discovery of a naturally occurring co-crystal of chrysin and oroxylin A and the involvement of ERKs and p38 of MAPK pathways in the induction of apoptosis in HeLa cells by the co-crystal. Our study sheds light on the development of a co-crystal of chrysin and oroxylin A in a specific ratio of 1:1 for combination therapy of the two APIs. The purified co-crystal was found to be more efficient compared to the compounds present individually. Further analysis of the physiochemical properties and molecular mechanisms of the isolated co-crystal in different cancer cells is warranted for its application in therapeutics."

Kurtz is a very important medicinal plant with several therapeutic applications. It is a main constituent of the Ayurvedic formulation 'Dashmool' used for multifaceted disorders by the Indians. However, the constituents of this plant in neurological conditions have not been well studied. Here, we performed activity-guided isolation of compounds for opioid receptor modulator activity. In the study, we found that the isolated compound baicalein (3) has shown the most potent and competitive antagonistic activity at 20 mg/kg dose in vivo experiments. The acute dose of 3 (20 mg/kg) and pan opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (20 mg/kg) block the morphine-induced antinociception and the paw withdrawal latency decreases up to 8.3 s and 9.6 s, respectively. The in silico studies also support our in vitro data that compound 3 binds with MOR and KOR."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shyonaka (Oroxylum indicum Vent) is widely used in Ayurveda and in ethnomedical practice for the treatment of inflammation, pain, diarrhea, non-healing ulcers, and cancer. Owing to the high prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients, simultaneous targeting of proteins involved in both EBV replication and NPC proliferation might help to manage the disease effectively. OBJECTIVES: This study is designed to identify potential dual targeting inhibitors from Oroxylum indicum having the potential to inhibit both EBV and NPC. This study also attempted quantitative analysis of Shyonaka Bark Decoction (SBD) to confirm the presence of Baicalein and Chrysin which are predominant marker compounds of Shyonaka. METHODOLOGY: The HPLC analysis of stem bark and root bark of Oroxylum indicum was done to estimate the presence of marker compounds Baicalein and Chrysalin. The in-silico analysis included ADMET analysis followed by molecular docking of known compounds from Oroxylum indicum (retrieved from IMPPAT database) onto the target proteins of EBV (BHRF1, NEC1, dUTPase, Uracil DNA glycosylase) and NPC (COX-2, EGFR, and MDM2) using DOCK6 tool. Further validations were done using the molecular dynamics simulations of top screened molecules onto the selected target proteins using AMBER20 package and their corresponding MMGBSA binding free-energy values were calculated. RESULTS: The molecular docking revealed that the key molecules from the plant, scutellarein 7-rutinoside (S7R), scutellarin (SCU) and 6-hydroxyluteolin, Baicalein and 5,7-Dihydroxy-2-phenyl-6-[3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]oxychromen-4-one (57D) are effectively intervening with the target proteins of EBV, one of the key causative factors of NPC and the NPC specific targets which have the potential to reduce tumor size and other consequences of NPC. The molecular dynamics simulations of S7R, Baicalein and 57D, Baicalein with MDM-2 protein and dUTPase protein, respectively, showed stable interactions between them which were further assessed by the binding energy calculations. CONCLUSION: Overall, the in-silico evaluation of these phytochemicals with target proteins indicates their potential to inhibit both EBV and NPC which needs further in-vitro and in-vivo validations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lipid metabolism disorders have become a major global public health issue. Due to the complexity of these diseases, additional research and drugs are needed. Oroxin A, the major component of Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz (Bignoniaceae), can improve the lipid profiles of diabetic and insulin-resistant (IR) rats. Because insulin resistance is strongly correlated with lipid metabolism, improving insulin resistance may also constitute an effective strategy for improving lipid metabolism. Thus, additional research on the efficacy and mechanism of oroxin An under non-IR conditions is needed. METHODS: In this study, we established lipid metabolism disorder model rats by high-fat diet feeding and fatty HepG2 cell lines by treatment with oleic acid and evaluated the therapeutic effect and mechanism of oroxin A in vitro and in vivo through biochemical indicator analysis, pathological staining, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Oroxin A improved disordered lipid metabolism under non-IR conditions, improved the plasma and hepatic lipid profiles, and enhanced the lipid-lowering action of atorvastatin. Additionally, oroxin A reduced the total triglyceride (TG) levels by inhibiting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) expression and reducing the expression of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) in vivo and in vitro. Oroxin A also reduced the total cholesterol (TC) levels by inhibiting SREBP2 expression and reducing HMGCR expression in vivo and in vitro. In addition, oroxin A bound to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and increased AMPK phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that oroxin A may modulate the nuclear transcriptional activity of SREBPs by binding to LDLR proteins and increasing AMPK phosphorylation. Oroxin A may thus reduce lipid synthesis and could be used for the treatment and prevention of lipid metabolism disorders."

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one life-threatening disorder that is prevalent worldwide. The evident etiology of this disease is still poorly understood. Currently, herbal medicine is gaining more interest as an alternative antidepressant. Oroxylum indicum, which is used in traditional medicine and contains a potential antidepressive compound, baicalein, could have an antidepressive property. An in vitro monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitory assay was used to preliminarily screening for the antidepressant effect of O. indicum seed (OIS) extract. Mice were subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) for 6 weeks, and the daily administration of OIS extract started from week 4. The mechanisms involved in the antidepressive activity were investigated. The OIS extract significantly alleviated anhedonia and despair behaviors in the UCMS-induced mouse model via two possible pathways: (i) it normalized the HPA axis function via the restoration of negative feedback (decreased FKBP5 and increased GR expressions) and the reduction in the glucocorticoid-related negative gene (SGK-1), and (ii) it improved neurogenesis via the escalation of BDNF and CREB expressions in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex. In addition, an HPLC analysis of the OIS extract showed the presence of baicalin, baicalein, and chrysin as major constituents. All of the results obtained from this study emphasize the potential of OIS extract containing baicalin and baicalein as an effective and novel alternative treatment for MDD.",

      "abstract": "E6 and E7 human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoproteins play a significant role in the malignant transformation of infected cervical cancer cells via suppression of tumour suppressor pathways by targeting p53 and pRb, respectively. This study aimed to investigate the anticancer effects of Oroxylum indicum (OI) leaves' methanol extract on SiHa cervical cancer cells. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, caspase (cas)-3, and cas-9), viral oncoproteins (E6 and E7), and tumour suppressor proteins (p53 and pRb) were evaluated using western blot analysis before and after E6/E7 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) transfection. In addition, the E6/E7 mRNA expression levels were assessed with real-time (RT)-PCR. The present study showed that the OI extract effectively hindered the proliferation of SiHa cells and instigated increments of cas-3 and cas-9 expressions but decreased the Bcl-2 expressions. The OI extract inhibited E6/E7 viral oncoproteins, leading to upregulation of p53 and pRb tumour suppressor genes in SiHa cells. Additionally, combinatorial treatment of OI extract and gossypin flavonoid induced restorations of p53 and pRb. Treatment with OI extract in siRNA-transfected cells also further suppressed E6/E7 expression levels and further upregulations of p53 and pRb proteins. In conclusion, OI extract treatment on siRNAs-transfected SiHa cells can additively and effectively block E6- and E7-dependent p53 and pRb degradations. All these data suggest that OI could be explored for its chemotherapeutic potential in cervical cancer cells with HPV-integrated genomes.",

      "abstract": "Flavonoids are secondary metabolites that are widely found in various medicinal plants. They are known for their medicinal benefits and have been extensively used in healthcare industries and in the management of age-related diseases. This paper focuses on flavonoids from Oroxylum indicum, a significant medicinal tree in the practice of traditional Indian medicine. O. indicum has been utilized in a variety of polyherbal formulations for the management of musculoskeletal disorders, however the mechanism of action of its bioactive flavonoids remains unknown. The present study aimed to identify the flavonoids of O. indicum with the potential to target sclerostin, an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling pathway for the treatment of bone-related disorders. Molecular docking, coarse-grained and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to screen the major flavonoids and investigate their interaction with sclerostin. Flavonoids with highest binding affinity and interacting with at least one of the amino acids of the PNAIG motif residues were selected from docking studies and subjected to further drug likeness and ADMET screening. Further screening from coarse-grained and molecular dynamic simulations results showed that baicalein, compared to other screened flavonoids, stably binds with the important residues of the LRP6 binding site of sclerostin, resulting in pronounced structural changes in the protein. These findings suggest that baicalein from O. indicum can potentially inhibit sclerostin and can elicit skeletal protective effects, providing an insight for further in vitro and in vivo studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

      "abstract": "Breast cancer recurrence continues to pose a major clinical problem, despite significant advancements in early diagnosis and an aggressive mode of treatment. This study aimed at investigating the anticancer activity of Oroxylum indicum extract (OIE) by assessing cell proliferation, cell migration, and angiogenesis in metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell lines. This study also estimated the phytochemical profiles of OIE by LC-QTOF-MS. The extract was found to contain six identified flavonoid substances, and baicalein was the most abundant substance in the extract. Cell proliferation capacity was performed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. The effect of OIE on cell migration was determined using wound healing and transwell assays. Meanwhile, MDA-MB-231-induced angiogenesis on chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was applied to investigate the ex vivo antiangiogenesis activity of the extracts. OIE at concentrations lower than 600 μg/mL had no cytotoxic effects against MDA-MB-231 cells. OIE was found to inhibit the long-term colony formation ability of MDA-MB-231 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Antimigration and antiangiogenesis activities were further investigated using noncytotoxic concentrations of OIE ranging from 25 to 150 μg/mL. OIE greatly reduced the migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. OIE significantly suppressed the MDA-MB-231-induced angiogenesis, and there was no substantial toxic effect on natural angiogenesis. Interestingly, the concentration of OIE at 150 μg/mL was as practically potent as pazopanib, the positive anticancer drug, at 4.37 μg/mL in inhibiting MDA-MB-231 cell migration and angiogenesis induced by these cells. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of OIE in cell proliferation and cell migration, together with antiangiogenesis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, suggesting that OIE has the potential to be a novel adjunct candidate for breast cancer chemotherapeutic agents."

      "abstract": "In recent years, small molecule inhibition of LDHA (Lactate Dehydrogenase A) has evolved as an appealing option for anticancer therapy. LDHA catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate in the glycolysis pathway to play a crucial role in aerobic glycolysis. Therefore, in the current investigation LDHA was targeted with bioactive phytochemicals of an ethnomedicinally important plant species Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz. A total of 52 phytochemicals were screened against LDHA protein through molecular docking, ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) assay and molecular dynamics simulation to reveal three potential lead compounds such as Chrysin-7-O-glucuronide (-8.2 kcal/mol), Oroxindin (-8.1 kcal/mol) and Oroxin A (-8.0 kcal/mol). ADMET assay unveiled favorable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicity properties for all the lead compounds. Molecular dynamics simulation exhibited significant conformational stability and compactness. MM/GBSA free binding energy calculations further corroborated the selection of top candidates where Oroxindin (-46.47 kcal/mol) was found to be better than Chrysin-7-O-glucuronide (-45.72 kcal/mol) and Oroxin A (-37.25 kcal/mol). Aldolase reductase and Xanthine dehydrogenase enzymes were found as potential drug targets and Esculin, the FDA approved drug was identified as structurally analogous to Oroxindin. These results could drive in establishing novel medications targeting LDHA to fight cancer."

      "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a rare inherited disorder in which red blood cells (RBCs) under oxidative stress have altered sickle shape resulting in clinical complications. In this study, a library of pure natural products were screened to see their effectiveness in preventing sickling induced in blood samples of SCA patients, ex-vivo. The results indicated that baicalin (1) and naringenin (2), reduced sickling by 46.03 and 37.48 percent, respectively, compared to positive control, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), which inhibited RBC sickling by 56.87 percent. As a result of this screening, two compounds, baicalin (1) and naringenin (2), have been identified as potent sickling inhibitors. Study has clearly shown promising role of flavonoids for the management of SCD crisis for that not effective therapy is available. These phytochemicals or plant extracts can be explored further as an alternative anti-sickling remedy, owing to their high efficacy in the management of SCD crisis."

      "abstract": "Oroxylum indicum is a traditionally used plant in Ayurvedic and folk medicines. The plant is useful for the management of gastrointestinal diseases as well as skin diseases. In the present study, we analyzed the antitumor potential of O. indicum in Dalton's lymphoma ascites tumor cells (DLA) and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)-induced solid and ascites tumors. Further, the potential of O. indicum extract (OIM) on skin papilloma induction by dimethyl benz(a) anthracene (DMBA) and croton oil was evaluated. The chemical composition of the extract was analyzed using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. The predominant compounds present in the extract were demethoxycentaureidin 7-O-rutinoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, baicalein-7-O-glucuronide, 5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone, 3-Hydroxy-3',4',5'-trimethoxyflavone, 5,7-dihydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl) chromen-4-one, and 4'-Hydroxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavanone. Treatment with high-dose OIM enhanced the percentage of survival in ascites tumor-bearing mice by 34.97%. Likewise, high and low doses of OIM reduced the tumor volume in mice by 61.84% and 54.21%, respectively. Further, the skin papilloma formation was brought down by the administration of low- and high-dose groups of OIM (by 67.51% and 75.63%). Overall, the study concludes that the Oroxylum indicum root bark extract is a potentially active antitumor and anticancer agent.",

      "abstract": "Background: Beka (Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz) has been used as a culinary herb and natural remedy by the local communities in Malaysia. The leaf of O. indicum is traditionally used for the treatment of diarrhea, high blood pressure, and improving digestive health. Objectives: The present study was conducted to evaluate the phytochemical constituents and wound healing properties (in vitro and in vivo models) of aqueous and ethanol extracts of O. indicum leaves. Methods: The total phenolic (TPC) and total flavonoid (TFC) contents in the plant extracts were determined by the spectrophotometric methods. Further, the extract was characterized by Liquid Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS/MS) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The wound healing activity was assessed using the in vitro scratch wound-healing assay and in vivo excisional wound model. Results: The results show the ethanol leaves extract had the higher TPC (164 mg GAE/g) when compared with the aqueous leaves extract (30 mg gallic acid equivalents/g). The ethanol leaves extract was also found to have higher TFC (101 mg Catechin equivalents/g) than the aqueous leaves extract (76 mg Catechin equivalents/g). The ethanol leaves extract was then used for further chemical analysis. The LC-TOF-MS/MS analysis showed that the leaves extracts of O. indicum contains many important compounds such as Orientin, Chrysin, Pinoquercetin, Cupressuflavone, Puerarin xyloside, Forsythiaside and Paederoside. In GC-MS analysis, 19 compounds were identified in ethanolic leaves extract. The wound healing studies shows that O. indicum has promising wound healing activity by increasing the rate of wound contraction significantly (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, the present study showed that O. indicum leaf contains important phytochemicals and the wound healing potential of the O. indicum extract may probably be as a result of the presence of various phytoconstituents."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the predominant type of oral cancer. Its incidence is high in certain geographic regions, and it is correlated with chewing tobacco. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), induced by tobacco carcinogens, is overexpressed in OSCC, leading to poor prognosis. Thus, EGFR inhibitors are promising agents against OSCC. High cost and toxicity of existing EGFR inhibitors necessitate alternative EGFR-targeted therapy. Here, we tested the antitumor potential of ethyl acetate fraction of an ethnomedicinal tree, Oroxylum indicum stem bark extract (OIEA) in a 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO)-induced oral carcinogenesis model. METHODS: OIEA was prepared by solvent extraction method, and subsequently its in vitro radical scavenging activities were measured. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of OIEA was done to identify the constituent active compounds. Hemolytic, trypan blue exclusion, and MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide] assays were performed in normal and cancer cells to select an optimum dose of OIEA for antitumor activity study in 4NQO-induced oral cancer in F344 rats. Measurement of tumor volume, weight, and cell count was followed by tumor cell cycle analysis and comet and annexin V/Propidium Iodide (PI) assay. Pro-apoptotic markers were detected by western blot testing. Molecular docking was done to predict the interaction between OIEA active component and EGFR or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), which was further validated biologically. Finally, hepatic and renal function testing and histopathology were performed. RESULTS: OIEA reduced tumor burden and increased survivability of the tumor-bearing rats significantly as compared to untreated tumor bearers. HPLC revealed oroxylin A as the predominant bioactive component in OIEA. Molecular docking predicted significant binding between oroxylin A and EGFR as well as PI3K, which was confirmed by western blot analysis of in vivo samples. OIEA also ameliorated hepato-, renal- and myelotoxicity induced by 4NQO. CONCLUSION: OIEA reduces 4NQO-induced OSCC by modulating the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling cascade and also ameliorated toxicity in tumor bearers.",

      "abstract": "The leaf crude extract of Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz induces genomic DNA fragmentation, comet formation, and the inhibition of cell proliferation in the prostate cancer cell line PC3, as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis, comet assay and MTT assay, respectively. The bioactive compound was purified through bioassay-guided fractionation using preparative HPLC and MTT assay. The light brown and water-soluble compound was characterized using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. The compound was identified as a glycosylated hydroquinone derivative, 2-[p-(2-Carboxyhydrazino)phenoxy]-6-(hydroxymethyl) tetrahy-dro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol (molecular formula, C13H18N2O8; molecular mass = 330). The identified phytocompound has not been reported earlier elsewhere. Therefore, the common name of the novel anticancer phytocompound isolated from Oroxylum indicum in this current study is oroxyquinone. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of oroxyquinone on PC3 cells was 58.9 µM (95% CI = 54.5 to 63.7 µM). Treatment of PC3 cells with oroxyquinone induced genomic DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation, increased in the annexin-V positive cells, arrested the cell cycle at S phases, and inhibited the cell migration; as assessed by comet assay, DAPI staining, flow cytometry and a wound healing assay, respectively. On the investigation of the molecular mechanism of the induction of apoptosis, the results indicated that oroxyquinone induced caspase-3 and PARP independent apoptosis but through the p38 pathway and the localization of AIF into the nucleus. The present study identifies a novel anticancer molecule and provides scientific evidence supporting the therapeutic potency of Oroxylum indicum for ethnomedicinal uses."

      "abstract": "Oroxylum indicum, of the Bignoniaceae family, has various ethnomedical uses such as an astringent, anti-inflammatory, anti-bronchitis, anti-helminthic and anti-microbial, including anticancer properties. The druggability of OI stem bark extract was determined by its molecular docking interactions with PARP and Caspase-3, two proteins involved in cell survival and death. Note that 50 µg/mL of Oroxylum indicum extract (OIE) showed a significant (p < 0.05%) toxicity to HSC-3 cells. MTT aided cell viability and proliferation assay demonstrated that 50 µg/mL of OIE displayed significant (p < 0.5%) reduction in cell number at 4 h of incubation time. Cell elongation and spindle formation was noticed when HSC-3 cells were treated with 50 µg/mL of OIE. OIE initiated DNA breakage and apoptosis in HSC-3 cells, as evident from DNA ladder assay and calcein/EB staining. Apoptosis potential of OIE is confirmed by flow cytometer and triple-staining (live cell/apoptosis/necrosis) assay. Caspase-3/7 fluorescence quenching (LANCE) assay demonstrated that 50 µg/mL of OIE significantly enhanced the RFU of caspases-3/7, indicating that the apoptosis potential of OIE is probably through the activation of caspases. Immuno-cytochemistry of HSC-3 cells treated with 50 µg/mL of OIE showed a significant reduction in mitochondrial bodies as well as a reduction in RFU in 60 min of incubation time. Immunoblotting studies clearly showed that treatment of HSC-3 cells with OI extract caused caspase-3 activation and PARP deactivation, resulting in apoptotic cell death. Overall, our data indicate that OIE is an effective apoptotic agent for human squamous carcinoma cells and it could be a future cancer chemotherapeutic target.",

      "abstract": "Administration of Chemotherapeutics, especially doxorubicin (DOX) and cyclophosphamide (CPS), is commonly associated with adverse effects such as myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. At this time, few approved therapeutic options are currently available for the management of chemotherapy-associated cardiotoxicity. Thus, identification of novel therapeutics with potent cardioprotective properties and minimal adverse effects are pertinent in treating Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity. Oroxylum indicum extract (OIE, Sabroxy®) is a natural product known to possess several beneficial biological functions including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. We therefore set to investigate the cardioprotective effects of OIE against Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity and explore the potential cardioprotective mechanisms involved. Adult male mice were treated with DOX and CPS in combination, OIE alone, or a combination of OIE and DOX & CPS. Swimming test was performed to assess cardiac function. Markers of oxidative stress were assessed by levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrite, hydrogen peroxide, catalase, and glutathione content. The activity of interleukin converting enzyme and cyclooxygenase was determined as markers of inflammation. Mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring Complex-I activity. Apoptosis was assessed by Caspase-3 and protease activity. Mice treated with DOX and CPS exhibited reduced swim rate, increased oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and apoptosis in the heart tissue. These cardiotoxic effects were significantly reduced by co-administration of OIE. Furthermore, computational molecular docking studies revealed potential binding of DOX and CPS to tyrosine hydroxylase which validated our in vivo findings regarding the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Our current findings indicated that OIE counteracts Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity-through inhibition of ROS-mediated apoptosis and by blocking the effect on tyrosine hydroxylase. Taken together, our findings suggested that OIE possesses cardioprotective effects to counteract potentially fatal cardiac complications associated with chemotherapy treatment.",

Purpose: Examine the effects of Oroxylum indicum on cognitive function in older adults with self-reported cognitive complaints. Study Design: Two-arm, parallel-group, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Methods: Eighty-two volunteers received either 500 mg, twice daily of a standardized Oroxylum indicum extract or placebo. Outcome measures included several computer-based cognitive tasks, the Control, Autonomy, Self-Realization, and Pleasure scale (CASP-19), Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Changes in the concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were also examined. Results: Compared to the placebo, Oroxylum indicum was associated with greater improvements in episodic memory, and on several computer-based cognitive tasks such as immediate word recall and numeric working memory, and a faster rate of learning on the location learning task. However, there were no other significant differences in performance on the other assessed cognitive tests, the MoCA total score, or other self-report questionnaires. BDNF concentrations increased significantly in both groups, with no statistically-significant between-group differences. Oroxylum indicum was well tolerated except for an increased tendency for mild digestive complaints and headaches. Conclusion: The results of this first human trial on the cognitive-enhancing effects of Oroxylum indicum suggest that it is a promising herbal candidate for the improvement of cognitive function in older adults with self-reported cognitive complaints."

It is currently unknown whether OIE has the potential to induce hepatotoxicity. PURPOSE: In the current study, we sought to determine whether OIE can induce hepatotoxicity in C57BL/6J mouse model. METHODS: The male mice were fed powdered rodent food (control group) or powdered rodent food mixed with OIE (Sabroxy®, 500mg/kg) daily for 4 weeks. Following the treatment, we assessed liver histology and serum levels of biomarkers commonly associated with liver damage, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). RESULTS: No significant alterations were observed in liver histology, and serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, albumin, globulin and total protein in the OIE fed mice compared to the control mice. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that OIE, when fed at its physiologically relevant dosage, does not induce hepatotoxicity in C57BL/6J mice."

      "abstract": "While chemotherapy is the most effective therapeutic approach for treating a variety of cancer patients, commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, often induce several adverse effects. Escalating evidence indicates that chemotherapeutics, particularly doxorubicin (DOX) and cyclophosphamide (CPS), induce cognitive impairment associated with central nervous system toxicity. This study was performed to determine neuroprotective effects of Oroxylum indicum extract (OIE) in regard to preventing chemotherapy induced cognitive impairment (CICI) occurring after 4 cycles of DOX (2mg/kg) and CPS (50mg/kg) combination chemotherapy in male C57BL/6J mice. OIE significantly prevented the chemotherapy impaired short-term cognitive performance, exploratory behavior associated with cognitive performance, cognitive performance, and spatial learning and memory in the Y-maze, Open-Field, Novel Object Recognition, and Morris Water Maze tests, respectively. These data suggest that OIE protects from the CICI. OIE decreased the reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxide generated by the chemotherapy treatment in the brain, while also blocking the chemotherapy-induced glutathione depletion. These results establish that OIE exhibits potent antioxidant activity in chemotherapy treated mice. Notably, OIE significantly increased the Complex-I and Complex-IV activities in the brain, indicating that OIE enhances mitochondrial function in the brain. In silico analysis of the major active chemical constituents (Oroxylin A, Baicalein and Chrysin) of OIE indicated that OIE has a favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile. Taken together, our results are consistent with the conclusion that OIE prevents CICI by counteracting oxidative stress and perhaps by improving mitochondrial function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), especially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), has significantly increased in recent years and has become an important public health issue. However, no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved first-line drug is currently available for the treatment of NAFLD and NASH; therefore, research on new drugs is currently a hot topic. Oroxylum indicum (Linn.) Kurz is extensively distributed in South China and South Asia and has many biological activities. However, its effects on NAFLD or even NASH and the corresponding mechanisms are still not clear. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect and mechanism of O. indicum seed extract (OISE) on preventing anti-inflammatory action in the progression from simple nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to NASH. METHODS: A network pharmacology method to construct ingredient-target networks and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of OISE in NASH were constructed for topological analyses and hub-target screening. Enrichment analyses were performed to identify the critical biological processes and signaling pathways. Simultaneously, in vitro and in vivo experiments investigated the effect and mechanism of OISE, baicalein, and chrysin on inflammation by biochemical indicator detection, luciferase reporters, pathological staining, and immunoblotting in oleic acid-stimulated HepG2 cells or in high-fat diet-fed rats. RESULTS: The network pharmacology showed that OISE prevented the development and progression of NAFL into NASH through various pathways and targets and that the nuclear factor NF-κB (NF-κB) pathway regulated by baicalein and chrysin played an important role in the treatment of NASH. In in vitro experiments, we further showed that OISE and its ingredients, namely, baicalein and chrysin, all improved the inflammatory status in oleic acid-stimulated HepG2 cells, inhibited the nuclear transcriptional activities of NF-κB, increased the IκB level, and decreased the phosphorylation level of NF-κB. Furthermore, in a high-fat diet-induced NASH model in rats, we also showed that OISE prevented the development and progression of NASH by inhibiting the nuclear transcriptional activity of NF-κB. CONCLUSION: OISE suppressed inflammatory responses and prevented the development and progression of NAFL into NASH through inhibition of the nuclear transcriptional activity of NF-κB. OISE may be used to treat NAFLD through many functions, including an increase in insulin sensitivity, a decrease in lipid accumulation in the liver, suppression of inflammation, and clearance of free radicals.",

      "abstract": "In Southeast Asia, traditional medicine has a longestablished history and plays an important role in the health care system. Various traditional medicinal plants have been used to treat diseases since ancient times and much of this traditional knowledge remains preserved today. Oroxylum indicum (beko plant) is one of the medicinal herb plants that is widely distributed throughout Asia. It is a versatile plant and almost every part of the plant is reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological activities. Many of the important bioactivities of this medicinal plant is related to the most abundant bioactive constituent found in this plant-the baicalein. Nonetheless, there is still no systematic review to report and vindicate the biological activities and therapeutic potential of baicalein extracted from O. indicum to treat human diseases. In this review, we aimed to systematically present in vivo and in vitro studies searched from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Google Scholar database up to 31 March 2020 based on keywords \"Oroxylum indicum\" and \"baicalein\". After an initial screening of titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text analysis and validation, 20 articles that fulfilled all the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in this systematic review. The searched data comprehensively reported the biological activities and therapeutic potential of baicalein originating from the O. indicum plant for anti-cancer, antibacterial, anti-hyperglycemia, neurogenesis, cardioprotective, anti-adipogenesis, anti-inflammatory and wound healing effects. Nonetheless, we noticed that there was a scarcity of evidence on the efficacy of this natural active compound in human clinical studies. In conclusion, this systematic review article provides new insight into O. indicum and its active constituent baicalein as a prospective complementary therapy from the perspective of modern and scientific aspect. We indicate the potential of this natural product to be developed into more conscientious and judicious evidencebased medicine in the future. However, we also recommend more clinical research to confirm the efficacy and safety of baicalein as therapeutic medicine for patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oroxylum indicum fruit extract (OIE) has been reported to inhibit the development of adipocytes. However, the exact mechanism of its metabolic activity is not clearly defined. This study attempted to investigate whether OIE was involved in disrupting the cell cycle, glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial function in 3 T3-L1 cells. METHODS: The effect of the OIE on cell cycle progression was measured by flow cytometry along with observing the expression of the cycle regulator by immunoblotting. The effect of the OIE on glucose metabolism was investigated. The amount of glucose uptake (2-NBDG) influenced by insulin was determined as well as the protein tyrosine phosphorylation (PY20), and glucose transporter4 (GLUT4) expression was determined by immunoblotting assay. Mitochondria are also essential to metabolic processes. This study investigated mitochondrial activity using fluorescent lipophilic carbocyanine dye (JC-1) and mitochondria mass by MitoTracker Green (MTG) staining fluorescence dyes. Finally, cellular ATP concentration was measured using an ATP chemiluminescence assay. RESULTS: Treatment with OIE plus adipogenic stimulators for 24 h arrested cell cycle progression in the G2/M phase. Moreover, 200 μg/mL of OIE significantly diminished the expression of the insulin receptor (IR) and GLUT4 protein compared to the untreated-adipocytes (P < 0.05). The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was significantly reduced (24 h) and increased (day 12) by OIE compared to untreated-adipocytes (P < 0.05). However, OIE maintained MMP and ATP at a similar level compared to the pre-adipocytes (day 12). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) results demonstrated that OIE could protect mitochondria deformation compared to the untreated-adipocytes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of the OIE on adipogenesis may potentially inhibit the cell cycle and phosphorylation of IR, leading to a decrease in glucose uptake to the cells. The OIE also slows down the mitochondrial activity of the early phase of cell differentiation, which can also inhibit the development of fat cells.",

The potential of preconditioned NSC can be determined based on the expression of several key neuroprotective genes using qRT-PCR technique. However, prior to that, it is imperative and extremely important to carefully select reference gene(s) for accurate qRT-PCR data normalization to avoid error in data interpretation. This study aimed to evaluate the stability of ten candidate reference genes via comprehensive analysis using three algorithms software: geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. Our results revealed that HPRT1 and RPL13A were the most reliable reference genes for BEF-preconditioned NSCs, but ironically, HPRT1 was ranked as the least stable reference gene for hypoxic-preconditioned NSCs. On the other hand, RPLP1 and RPL13A were selected as the most stably expressed pair of reference genes for hypoxic-preconditioned NSCs. In conclusion, this study has pointed out the importance of identifying valid reference genes and has presented the first significant validation on best reference genes recommended for qRT-PCR study involves NSC preconditioned with hypoxia or with BEF extracted from Oroxylum indicum medicinal plant."

      "abstract": "It has been reported that amyloid β peptide, the major component of senile plaques, serves a critical role in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of Oroxylum indicum (L.) extract against Aβ25‑35‑induced oxidative stress and cell injury using SH‑SY5Y cells as a model, and at exploring the underlying mechanisms. The results revealed that the exposure of cells to 20 µM Aβ25‑35 significantly increased cellular oxidative stress, as evidenced by the increased ROS levels. Aβ25‑35 treatment also increased caspase‑3/7 activity and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and caused viability loss. Oroxylum indicum treatment not only attenuated the generation of ROS and suppressed caspase‑3/7 activity but also reduced the neurotoxicity of Aβ25‑35 in a concentration‑dependent manner, as evidenced by the increased cell viability and decreased LDH release. Treatment with Oroxylum indicum also increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, increased the phosphorylation of Akt and cAMP‑responsive element binding protein (CREB), and contributed to the upregulation of Bcl‑2 protein. In combination, these results indicated that Oroxylum indicum extract could protect SH‑SY5Y cells against Aβ25‑35‑induced cell injury, at least partly, by inhibiting oxidative stress, increasing SOD and CAT activity, attenuating caspase 3/7 activity and promoting the cell survival pathway, Akt/CREB/Bcl‑2. The approach used in the present study may also be useful for preventing the neurotoxicity induced by Aβ in AD and related neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies investigating the activity of Oroxylum indicum extract in vivo are now required.",

      "abstract": "Oroxylum indicum is a medicinal plant in Thailand, which has been used as a tonic and for the treatment of various diseases. Extracts from various parts of O. indicum were reported as promoting in vitro antioxidant and antibacterial effects. Phytochemical analysis suggested that this plant contained some flavones. O. indicum fruit and seed water and ethanol extracts and their major flavonoids including baicalein, baicalin, and chrysin were tested for in vitro antibacterial activities on four clinical isolated bacteria, namely, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococcus suis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and β-Escherichia coli, using a broth micro-dilution assay. The amounts of these three major flavonoids were also quantitatively analyzed using the high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. O. indicum fruit ethanol extract from Nakhon Pathom province (OFNE) promoted the strongest antimicrobial activity against four clinical pathogenic bacteria, including S. intermedius (IC50 = 1.30 mg/mL), S. suis (13.59% inhibition at 7.81 mg/mL), P. aeruginosa (IC50 = 39.20 mg/mL), and β-E. coli (IC50 = 66.85 mg/mL). Baicalin showed high in vitro antibacterial effect to all tested bacteria. From the optimized and validated HPLC method, baicalin, baicalein, and chrysin contents in O. indicum extracts were 0.19 ± 0.00 - 9.45 ± 0.13, 0.14 ± 0.00 - 1.27 ± 0.02, and 0.02 ± 0.00 - 0.96 ± 0.02 g/100 g extract, respectively.

Liver enzyme concentration (SGPT, SGOT) had also been assessed. After being extracted in organic solvent, 3 distinct doses, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg b.w. (p.o.), were used. For edema formation 0.1 ml carrageenan at a dose of 1% w/v was injected into paw of left hind. It showed a fall of edemas 37.50%, 48.34%, and 55.83% while used doses were 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg b.w. (p.o.) individually. The EtOH extract of O. indicum (50%) and its fractions PET, CLF, EtOAc, and nBUT were studied against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage. Only PET and n-BuOH exhibited the highest percentage of protection and were 96% and 99%, respectively, persuaded by ethanol. In OGTT glibenclamide revealed reduction of glucose level to 7.55 ± 0.22 mmol/L from 10.57 ± 0.32 mmol/L after 30 minutes. Antihyperglycemic activities were assessed for 8- and 12-week duration in diabetic rats. Glibenclamide reduced glucose level from 33.50±0.31 to 7.90±0.19 mmol/L in 12 weeks. In 12 and 8 weeks, combination therapy lowered blood glucose level to a normal extent by 79% and 61% individually. In antidyslipidemic activities after 12-week treatment, it revealed simvastatin; MEOI (400 mg/kg b.w.) and combination of both reduced TC level by 44%, 28%, and 48% consequently followed by TG and LDL. In 8-week treatment, HDL levels were increased by 34%, 13%, and 36%, and in 12 weeks increased by 36%, 8%, and 38% consequently. Liver enzyme concentration after 12 weeks of treatment with glibenclamide, 400 mg/kg b.w. (p.o.) of MEOI and combination of both, exhibited the fact that concentration of SGPT showed downturn by 43.23%, 8.01%, and 54.86% and SGOT by 42.40%, 5.31%, and 44.85%. This study remarked that O. indicum has anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, antidiabetic, and antidyslipidemic potentials but has no ameliorative effect on liver enzyme."

Therefore, the activation of p53 through small molecules is an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers retaining wild-type p53. We used a library of 700 Myanmar wild plant extracts to identify small molecules that induce p53 transcriptional activity. A cell-based screening method with a p53-responsive luciferase-reporter assay system revealed that an ethanol extract of Oroxylum indicum bark increased p53 transcriptional activity. Chrysin was isolated and identified as the active ingredient in the O. indicum bark extract. A treatment with chrysin increased p53 protein expression and the p53-mediated expression of downstream target genes, and decreased cell viability in MCF7 cells, but not in p53-knockdown MCF7 cells. We also found that chrysin activated the ATM-Chk2 pathway in the absence of DNA damage. Hence, the inactivation of the ATM-Chk2 pathway suppressed p53 activation induced by chrysin. These results suggest the potential of chrysin as an anti-cancer drug through the activation of p53 without DNA damage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz (O. indicum) is found in Thailand. It has been used for the treatment of obesity. This study aimed to investigate the effects of an O. indicum extract (OIE) on the adipogenic and biomolecular change in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. METHODS: Initial studies examined the chemical components of OIE. The cell line 3T3-L1 was used to establish potential toxic effects of OIE during the differentiation of pre-adipocytes to adipocytes. The inhibitory effect of OIE on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells was investigated. Moreover, the impact of OIE on pancreatic lipase activity was determined. In further experiments, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) was used to monitor and discriminate biomolecular changes caused by the potential anti-adipogenic effect of OIE on 3T3-L1 cells. RESULTS: Chemical screening methods indicated that OIE was composed of flavonoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides, and tannins. The percentage viability of 3T3-L1 cells was not significantly decreased after exposure to either 200 or 150 μg/mL of OIE for 2 and 10 days, respectively compared to control cells. The OIE exhibited a dose-dependent reduction of lipid accumulation compared to the control (p < 0.05). The extract also demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect upon lipase activity compared to the control. The inhibitory effect of the OIE on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells was also confirmed using FTIR microspectroscopy. The signal intensity and the integrated areas relating to lipids, lipid esters, nucleic acids, glycogen and carbohydrates of the OIE-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were significantly lower than the non-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (p < 0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated four distinct clusters for the FTIR spectra of 3T3-L1 adipocytes based on biomolecular changes (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates). This observation was confirmed using Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis (UHCA). CONCLUSIONS: These novel findings provide evidence that the OIE derived from the fruit pods of the plant is capable of inhibiting lipid and carbohydrate accumulation in adipocytes and also has the potential to inhibit an enzyme associated with fat absorption. The initial observations indicate that OIE may have important properties which in the future may be exploited for the management of the overweight or obese.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the antimelanogenic effect of an ethyl acetate fraction of Oroxylum indicum Vent. seeds (OISEA) and its underlying mechanisms in melan-a cells were investigated. Antimelanogenesis activity was confirmed by assessing inhibition of tyrosinase activity and melanin content in the cells. Both transcriptional and translational expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase, and tyrosinase related protein-1 and 2 (TYRP-1 and TYRP-2), were also examined. The results depicted that pretreatment of OISEA significantly inhibits not only tyrosinase activity, but melanin production and intracellular tyrosinase activity. By repressing the expression of tyrosinase, TYRP-1, TYRP-2, and MITF, OISEA interrupted melanin production. Additionally, OISEA interfered with the phosphorylation of p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), with the reversal of OISEA-induced melanogenesis inhibition after treatment with the specific inhibitors SB239063, U0126, and SP600125. Overall, these results suggest that OISEA can stimulate p38, ERK1/2, JNK phosphorylation, and subsequent suppression of melanin, leading to the inhibition of melanogenic enzymes and melanin production, possibly owing to the presence of polyphenolic compounds.",

Driven by the lack of approved medication and vaccination, research on anti-Chikungunya agents has received great attention. In an effort to determine potential inhibitor of CHIKV, this study aimed at investigating the potential anti-viral activity of Oroxylum indicum extracts towards CHIKV-infected Vero cells. The virucidal, pre- and post-treatment effects of O. indicum were evaluated, using the maximum non-toxic dose of O. indicum methanol and aqueous extracts as determined by cytotoxicity assay. The viral inhibitory effect was assessed by the morphological changes of Vero cells and further confirmed by plaque assay. Both methanol and aqueous extracts of O. indicum had similar cytotoxicity in Vero cells. Interestingly, the virucidal effect of O. indicum aqueous extract revealed a significant reduction on the viral titre (p < 0.05). The prophylactic effect of aqueous extract was demonstrated when the pre-treated cells exhibited a significant anti-CHIKV activity (p < 0.05). However, methanol extract of this plant exerted an anti-viral activity against CHIKV only to a certain extent. Therefore, the aqueous extract of this plant has a potential to inhibit the virus and acts as prophylactic agent against CHIKV. Further studies however are needed to substantiate the finding and to determine the important compound of this plant as well as the mechanism of action in treating CHIKV infection."

Our previous study showed that an ethanol-water O. indicum seed extract (OISE), when combined with acarbose, reduced the risk of diabetes by 75% and effectively prevented the associated complications. Oroxin A, a major component of OISE, can activate PPARγ and inhibit α-glucosidase and it represents a promising candidate for diabetes intervention. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of oroxin A from O. indicum on the progression of prediabetes to diabetes and the underlying mechanisms in streptozotocin and high-fat-diet induced prediabetic mice. METHODS: Oroxin A was purified from OISE and its PPARγ transcriptional activation was determined in vitro and in vivo. The prediabetic mice were established by high-fat diet and streptozotocin, which was followed by treatment with oroxin A. The effect of oroxin A was determined by analysis of the lipid profiles, oxidative stress, hepatic function and histology. The mechanism of oroxin A was also investigated. RESULTS: Oroxin A is a compound with low toxicity that has reduced the relative risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes by 66.7% without inducing weight gain or hepatotoxicity. Oroxin A also improved the complications of prediabetes, such as lipid metabolism dysfunction and liver injury. Results of mechanism studies suggested that oroxin A is a partial PPARγ agonist that can activate PPARγ transcriptional activation in vitro and in vivo. Oroxin A also exhibited an inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase and an antioxidant capacity. CONCLUSION: Oroxin A prevents the progression from prediabetes to diabetes through a multi-pathway intervention mechanism.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cardioprotective effect of 70% methanolic extract of O. indicum Vent. root bark (OIM) against doxorubicin induced cardiomyopathy in female Sprague Dawley rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cardiotoxicity was induced by intra-peritoneal injection of doxorubicin 30 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) for 4 consecutive days after a ten-day pre-treatment of animals with OIM at 200 mg/kg b.w. and 400 mg/kg b.w (p.o.). Drug treatment continued up to day 14. Probucol, orally administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg b.w. served as standard. ECG was recorded. The animals were sacrificed on day 15 and comparative analysis of serum marker levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Serum Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (SGOT), Serum Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT), tissue antioxidant status based on Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), reduced Glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) was carried out. Histopathological examination was carried out using hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: ECG records of OIM treated animals showed normal pattern, in comparison to the control with ST depression and arrhythmia in cardiogram. Tissue antioxidant profile (SOD, GSH and GPx) was significantly (p < 0.01) elevated in the cardiac tissue of treated group in dose-dependent manner; lipid peroxidation level was found to decrease with treatment. Comparative analysis of serum markers - CPK, LDH, SGOT and SGPT - among untreated control, standard and extract treated groups revealed that OIM extract at 400 mg/kg b.w. dose significantly reduced the levels (p < 0.01). Histological analysis revealed normal myocardial architecture in OIM treated groups. HPTLC fingerprint of OIM revealed 8 bands and detected the presence of chrysin, apigenin and quercetin. CONCLUSION: O. indicum root bark shows marked cardio-protective activity, possibly due to the presence of antioxidant compounds acting synergistically."

      "abstract": "Worldwide, traditional usage of herbal medicines is a common practice to treat various parasitic infections. In India, bark decoction of Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz. (Bignoniaceae) is used as a traditional medicine to cure intestinal-helminthic infections. This study investigated the anthelmintic efficacy of methanolic bark extract of O. indicum on Hymenolepis diminuta (Cestoda), using both in vitro and in vivo methods. Utilizing a mini-questionnaire, first, we collected information about the pattern of anthelmintic use of this plant. Later, in vitro efficacy of extract was tested at 10, 20 and 30 mg/ml on both the artificially excysted juveniles and adult H. diminuta worms. Herein, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also utilized to determine the possible effects of extract on tegumental surfaces of juvenile and adult cestode. In vivo, extract was tested at 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg in H. diminuta albino rat model, against juvenile and adult cestode. Praziquantel (PZQ) served as reference drug in anthelmintic assays. The acute toxicity of extract was determined as per the OECD guidelines. The field questionnaire data revealed that 78 % of people in the area use O. indicum stem bark against intestinal helminths, and of these, 75 % of people also believed it highly efficacious anthelmintic remedy. In vitro testing of extract revealed significant effects on juvenile worms, and 30 mg/ml of extract caused mortality of juveniles at the initial period (0.25 ± 0.00 h). Conversely, PZQ (1 mg/ml) showed paralysis and mortality of juvenile cestodes in 0.44 ± 0.04 and 1.11 ± 0.06 h, respectively. As determined by SEM, in vitro exposure to extract showed substantial effects on both juveniles and adult worms in the form of wrinkled scolex, distorted tegument and eroded microtriches. In vivo study revealed better efficacy of extract against juveniles than adult stages of parasite. Treatment of rats with 1000 mg/kg of extract caused 79.3 % reduction in EPG counts and 70.8 % of reduction in worm counts, which compared well to PZQ efficacy. In acute toxicity study, administration of a single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg of extract to mice did not cause any signs of toxicity or mortality within 2-week observation. Hence, the LD50 of extract was estimated to be greater than 2000 mg/kg. In conclusion, the bark extract of O. indicum possesses concentration-dependent effects against the larval and adult H. diminuta worms, and thus the extract holds promise in the control of intestinal helminthiases. This also supports the common belief of people about the reputation of this plant as anthelmintic in traditional medicine. There is a need to standardize the formulations of this plant for their possible use as standardized herbal anthelmintic agents in the future.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Oroxylum indicum\\ (L.) Kurz has been used for centuries as a traditional medicine in Asia in ethnomedicinal systems for the prevention and treatment of several diseases, such as jaundice, arthritic and rheumatic problems, gastric ulcers, tumors, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and diarrhea and dysentery, among others. The present review provides scientific evidence supporting the therapeutic potency of the plant for ethnomedicinal uses and identifies gaps for future research to facilitate commercial exploitation. METHODS: This review is based on available information on traditional uses and phytochemical, pharmacological, clinical and toxicity data for Oroxylum indicum that was collected from electronic (SciFinder, PubMed, Science Direct, and ACS, among others) and library searches. KEY FINDING: A variety of traditional medicinal uses of Oroxylum indicum in different Southeast and South Asian countries have been reported in books describing the uses of these plants. Phytochemical investigations of the different parts of the plant resulted in identification of approximately 111 compounds, among which flavonoids, naphthalenoids and cyclohexylethanoids are the predominant groups. The crude extracts and their isolates exhibit a wide spectrum of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activities involving antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic, anticancer, anti-ulcer, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, antidiarrheal and antioxidant activities. Flavonoids are the major constituents of all parts of the plant. From a toxicity perspective, only aqueous and ethanolic extracts of stem bark, root bark and fruits have been assessed and found to be safe. The major flavonoids of the stem bark, such as baicalein, chrysin and oroxylin A, were reported for the first time as natural flavonoids with potent inhibitory activity against endoprotease enzymes and proprotein convertases, which play a key role in the growth of cancer and in viral and bacterial infections. Flavonoids are the active components of bioactive extracts. Several Ayurvedic medicines have been formulated either singly using this plant or along with other herbs for the treatment of different diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological results have supported some traditional medicinal uses of Oroxylum indicum. Several extracts and their isolates have been reported to exhibit interesting pharmacological properties. These components could be useful as sources of modern medicines following future detailed studies to elucidate their underlying mechanisms, toxicity, synergistic effects and clinical trials. Attention should also be focused on pharmacological studies investigating the traditional uses of the plant, which have not been yet addressed, as well as clinical studies investigating commercial Ayurvedic medicines and other ethnomedicinal preparations in human subjects based on this plant to confirm the safety and quality of the preparations.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Seventeen plants used in Vietnamese traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammatory disorders were screened for NF-κB inhibitory activity. Oroxylum indicum, which exhibited activity, was investigated in detail. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty plant extracts from 17 species were prepared by maceration using dichloromethane and methanol and were tested (10µg/mL) to evaluate their ability to inhibit NF-κB activation using TNF-α-stimulated HEK-293 cells stably transfected with a NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter. The active extract of Oroxylum indicum was subsequently fractionated by different chromatographic techniques. After isolation, all single compounds were identified by spectroscopic methods and assessed for NF-κB inhibitory effects. RESULTS: The dichloromethane extracts obtained from Chromolaena odorata leaves and the stem bark of Oroxylum indicum showed distinct inhibitory effects on NF-κB activation at a concentration of 10µg/mL. The active extract of Oroxylum indicum was subjected to further phytochemical studies resulting in identification of four flavonoid aglyca and six flavonoid glycosides. Pharmacological evaluation of the obtained compounds identified oroxylin A as the most active substance (IC50=3.9 µM, 95% CI: 3.5-4.4 µM), while chrysin and hispidulin showed lower activity with IC50=7.2µM (95% CI: 6.0-8.8 µM) and 9.0 µM (95% CI: 7.9-10.2 µM), respectively. Interestingly, in this study the activity of baicalein (IC50=28.1 µM, 95% CI: 24.6-32.0 µM) was weak. The isolated glycosides showed no inhibitory activity when tested at a concentration of 30 µM. Quantification of the four active flavonoids in extracts and plant materials suggested that oroxylin A contributes to the NF-κB inhibitory activity of the stem barks of Oroxylum indicum to a greater extent than baicalein which was thought to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of this plant. CONCLUSIONS: The screening presented in this study identified the dichloromethane extracts of Chromolaena odorata and Oroxylum indicum as promising sources for NF-κB inhibitors. Hispidulin, baicalein, chrysin and oroxylin A, isolated from Oroxylum indicum, were identified as inhibitors of NF- κB activation.",

This study was taken up to investigate the effect of OA, on adipogenesis, lipolysis and apoptosis in 3T3 L1 cells. Pre-adipocytes were treated with 10-40 μM OA on various days of adipogenesis treatment schedule. Mature adipocytes were treated with OA for lipolysis and apoptosis studies. In maturing pre-adipocytes, 10 μM OA suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation by 42.19% which was confirmed by lipidTox imaging of cells. In addition, OA decreased the nuclear translocation of PPARγ and mRNA expression of its downstream genes (FAS and LPL) along with adiponectin secretion. In mature adipocytes, 40 μM of OA decreased cell viability by 30% of control. Annexin V/PI staining showed induction of apoptosis which was further confirmed by enhanced levels of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, cyt c, AIF and chromatin condensation. OA enhanced TNF-α secretion, lipolysis and decreased Akt phosphorylation in mature adipocytes. Findings suggest that OA possibly exerts its anti-obesity effect by affecting adipocyte life cycle at critical points of differentiation and maturity. When we compared the potency of OA with non-methoxylated flavonoids morin, naringenin and kaempferol on adipocyte life cycle OA was far more potent. Thus, study clearly indicates a new role for oroxylin A as regulator of adipocyte life cycle. In addition, study also suggested a specific role of methoxylated group in exerting lipolysis and cytotoxic effects in mature adipocytes.",

      "abstract": "Despite clinical advances in anticancer therapy, there is still a need for novel anticancer metabolites, with higher efficacy and lesser side effects. Oroxylum indicum (L.) Vent. is a small tree of the Bignoniaceae family which is well known for its food and medicinal properties. In present study, the chemopreventive properties of O. indicum hot and cold non-polar extracts (petroleum ether and chloroform) were investigated with MDA- MB-231 (cancer cells) and WRL-68 (non-tumor cells) by XTT assay. All the extracts, and particularly the petroleum ether hot extract (PHO), exhibited significantly (P<0.05) higher cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 when compared to WRL-68 cells. PHO was then tested for apoptosis induction in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (MDA-MB-231) and ER-positive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells by cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA, where it proved more efficient in the MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, when PHO was tested for anti-metastatic potential in a cell migration inhibition assay, it exhibited beneficial effects. Thus non-polar extracts of O. indicum (especially PHO) can effectively target ER-negative breast cancer cells to induce apoptosis, without harming normal cells by cancer-specific cytotoxicity. Hence, it could be considered as an extract with candidate precursors to possibly harness or alleviate ER-negative breast cancer progression even in advanced stages of malignancy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Proprotein Convertases (PCs) or Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexins (PCSKs) belong to a family of calcium-dependent endoproteases that are structurally related to bacterial subtilisin and yeast kexin. These enzymes play major roles in the processing of inactive precursor proteins producing their bioactive mature forms that are implicated in a wide variety of diseases including cancer, viral and bacterial infections. As a result, PCs are major targets for intervention of these diseases. OBJECTIVE: Our objective in this study is to find non-peptide inhibitors of PC-enzymes from a potential natural source. RESULTS: Herein we describe several natural flavonoid compounds as inhibitors of PC-enzymes including furin, a key member. These compounds were isolated from the medicinal plant Oroxylum indicum, fully characterized and tested in vitro for their PC-inhibitory property against the fluorogenic peptide substrate, Boc-RVRR-MCA (Boc = tert-butyloxy carbonyl, MCA = 4-methyl coumarin7-amide). The measured Ki and IC50 were found to be in low microM ranges. A comparative analysis of inhibition against furin, PC4, PC5 and PC7 suggested a partial selectivity towards PC4. These flavonoids also blocked efficiently the PC4-mediated processing of a fluorogenic peptide derived from the processing site of its substrate, pro-Insulin Growth Factor-1 (proIGF-1). This anti-protease activity may provide a rationale for the observed anticancer and anti-HIV properties of some of these flavonoid compounds. This is the first demonstration of anti-PC activity of flavonoid compounds.",

      "abstract": "In the present study, the immunomodulatory activity and the mechanism of action of the n-butanol fraction (100 mg/kg body weight, per os, once daily for 22 consecutive days) of the root bark of Oroxylum indicum, vent. (Bignoniaceae) was evaluated in rats using measures of immune responses to sheep red blood cells (SRBC haemagglutinating antibody [HA] titer) and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. In response to SRBC, treatment with the n-butanol fraction caused a significant rise in circulating HA titers during secondary antibody responses, indicating a potentiation of certain aspects of the humoral response. The treatment also resulted in a significant rise in paw edema formation, indicating increased host DTH response. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of the drug was exhibited by significant reductions in whole blood malondialdehyde (MDA) content along with a rise in the activities/levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, histopathologic analysis of lymphoid tissues showed an increase in cellularity, e.g., T-lymphocytes and sinusoids, in the treatment group. In contrast, dexamethasone treatment caused significant reduction in the HA titer, DTH responses, and antioxidant potential. In a triple antigen-mediated immunological edema model, the extent of edema raised in drug-treated rats was greater compared to that in control rats, thus confirming enhanced DTH reactions in response to the drug treatment. Based on the above findings, the reported immunomodulatory activity of an active fraction of O. indicum might be attributed to its ability to enhance specific immune responses (both humoral and cell-mediated) as well as its antioxidant potential."

      "abstract": "A methanolic extract of the fruits of Oroxylum indicum, which is widely used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and anti-hypersensitivity effects, inhibited in vitro proliferation of HL-60 cells. The flavonoid baicalein was found as an active component in the extract. Analysis of freeze-dried fruits of the plant indicated that this component comprised about 4% of the material by dry weight. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of baicalein on the viability and induction of apoptosis in the HL-60 cell line. The cell viability after treating with baicalein for 24 h was quantified by counting viable cells using trypan blue staining. The results showed that baicalein caused a 50% inhibition of HL-60 cells at concentrations of 25-30 microM. The inhibition of proliferation of HL-60 cells due to 36-48 h exposure to 10 or 20 microM baicalein was associated with the accumulation of cells at S or G2M phases. However, proliferation inhibition at a higher dose may be associated with induction by apoptosis, as evidenced by the typical nuclear fragmentation using DNA fragmentation assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The results indicate that baicalein has anti-tumor effects on human cancer cells, and Oroxylum indicum extract could be used in supplementary cancer therapy.",
