      "abstract": "In this study, quercetin-incorporated squalene nanostructured lipid carriers (QS-NLCs) were developed to mitigate the pathological conditions of dry eye disease (DED). The melt emulsification method was used to prepare QS-NLCs. The resulting NLCs have 93.74 ± 9.32 nm particle size, 43.8 ± 5.42 % drug loading and showed good stability for 90 days at different storage conditions. The structural characterization of NLCs was carried out through DSC, FTIR, and XRD, and the morphological study was conducted using TEM analysis. The morphological study emphasised no agglomeration was present in the formulation, and further -31.47 ± 2.18 mV zeta potential supported the TEM analysis. Also, the QS-NLCs showed a release pattern in which more than 70 % of the drug was released in the medium in 1 h. After that, a sustained release pattern was observed for 6 h. However, QS-NLCs also showed higher ex-vivo corneal permeation, i.e., ∼2.5-fold, as compared to free quercetin. Also, no significant difference was observed in the moisture retention capacity of NLCs when compared with control glycerin. Further, the QS-NLCs showed good anti-inflammatory and cytotoxicity activities against RAW 264.7 and HCECs cell lines, respectively. Furthermore, 18.22 ± 1.23 mm of Schirmer score in a 5-day tear production study and a 2.79-fold increased half-life (T1/2), 3.02-fold enhanced area under the curve (AUC0-∞), and 2.88-fold higher mean retention time (MRT0-∞) were obtained which signified the higher bioavailability of QS-NLCs with higher ocular tolerance ensured by modified Draize test. Most importantly, the proposed QS-NLCs improved the pharmacological activities of quercetin against DED.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that activation of oncogenic K-ras alone is insufficient to drive tumor development and that additional factors are needed for full malignant transformation, but the metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms that facilitate K-ras-driven cancer development remain to be characterized. Here we show that SQLE, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, is upregulated in K-ras-driven cancer and its high expression is correlated with poor clinical outcome. K-ras regulates SQLE expression in a biphasic manner through reactive oxygen species and MYC signaling. Surprisingly, the pro-oncogenic role of SQLE is not mediated by promoting cholesterol synthesis, but by metabolic removal of squalene and thus mitigating its suppressive effect on the PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism. Genetic silencing of SQLE in pancreatic cancer cells causes an accumulation of cellular squalene, which binds to Sp1 protein and causes a formation of a tight Sp1-TFAP2E promoter DNA complex with a highly negative binding score. This aberrant squalene/Sp1/TFAP2E promoter complex hinders the expression of TFAP2E and its downstream molecule PGC-1α, leading to suppression of mitochondrial metabolism and an almost complete inhibition of tumor formation in vivo. Importantly, administration of pharmacological squalene to mice bearing pancreatic cancer xenografts could significantly inhibit tumor growth. Our study has revealed a previously unrecognized role of SQLE in regulating gene expression and mitochondrial metabolism to facilitate K-ras-driven cancer development, and identified SQLE as a novel therapeutic target for potential treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract": "Long-term exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation induces the accumulation of free radicals in the skin, resulting in oxidative damage and accelerated aging. As a natural anti-oxidant, squalene has been applied as a cosmetic additive. Nonetheless, the liquid oil state of squalene and its low solubility in water usually limits the practical application of squalene. Recently, phosphotungstate calcium nanowires has been synthesized to gelatinize oily solvents, making it feasible to fabricate stable oleogel formulation containing squalene. Herein, the squalene/phosphotungstate calcium nanowires (Sql/PWC) oleogel has been specifically designed and applied to treat skin photoaging. Such oleogel was comprised of oil-based structures that closely mimic the skin's natural lipids, resulting in enhanced skin penetration, better retention of active ingredients within the skin, and superior stability as compared to traditional hydrogel, especially under UVB exposure. It was found that the application of Sql/PWC oleogel on UVB-irradiated skin successfully decreased epidermal thickness, increased dermal thickness, and promoted the expression of elastin, collagen and skin barrier marker. Meanwhile, RNA-Sequencing results further revealed that the Sql/PWC oleogel alleviated UVB photo-damage through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in the skin, which were key factors in the aging process. We believe this study will not only bring new perspectives for skin photoaging treatment but also promotes the broader application of oleogel in the cosmetics industry.",

      "abstract": "Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) is a crucial enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis pathway and a promising target for therapeutic intervention in hypercholesterolemia and fungal infections. This study evaluates the inhibitory potential of six flavonoids namely silibinin, baicalin, naringenin, chrysin, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, and isorhamnetin against SQLE using an integrative approach combining in silico and experimental methods. Molecular docking revealed that apigenin-7-O-glucoside, silibinin, and baicalin displayed the highest binding affinities (-10.7, -10.2, and -10.0 kcal mol-1, respectively) and robust interactions with the SQLE binding site. These findings were corroborated by 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which demonstrated stable binding trajectories, minimal structural fluctuations, a thermodynamically favored potential energy landscape (PEL) and favorable MM/PBSA binding free energies for three flavonoids. Experimental validation via in vitro inhibition assays confirmed the computational predictions, with apigenin-7-O-glucoside emerging as the most potent inhibitor (IC50 = 1.74 ± 0.05 μM), followed by silibinin (IC50 = 1.88 ± 0.28 μM) and baicalin (IC50 = 2.50 ± 0.46 μM). Enzyme kinetics studies revealed distinct mechanisms of action: apigenin-7-O-glucoside exhibited competitive inhibition, while silibinin and baicalin showed mixed inhibition. Furthermore, in silico ADMET analysis indicated favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles for these flavonoids, with silibinin demonstrating particularly high bioavailability and lipophilicity. This study highlights apigenin-7-O-glucoside, silibinin, and baicalin as potent SQLE inhibitors with promising therapeutic potential. The congruence between in silico predictions and experimental results underscores the reliability of computational approaches in drug discovery, paving the way for future preclinical development of these compounds as novel SQLE-targeted therapeutics."

      "abstract": "Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) is a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and an attractive therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia and antifungal treatment. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory potential of six alkaloids-berberine, evodiamine, harmine, reserpine, matrine, and sanguinarine-against SQLE using a combined in silico and in vitro approach. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities ranging from -8.1 to -11.0 kcal/mol, with evodiamine demonstrating the highest affinity, followed by sanguinarine and berberine. 200 ns MD simulations confirmed stable interactions for all alkaloid-enzyme complexes, characterized by low RMSD values, robust hydrogen bonding, and favorable free energy landscapes, as supported by MM/PBSA analysis. Experimental validation through in vitro inhibition assays revealed that evodiamine (IC₅₀ = 2.87 ± 0.08 μM) exhibited potent inhibition comparable to the standard inhibitor TNSCPA (IC₅₀ = 2.65 ± 0.18 μM), while berberine (IC₅₀ = 3.57 ± 0.18 μM) and reserpine (IC₅₀ = 4.91 ± 0.34 μM) showed strong and moderate inhibition, respectively. Harmine, matrine, and sanguinarine were less effective. Enzyme kinetics studies demonstrated that berberine and reserpine act as noncompetitive inhibitors, binding to allosteric sites, whereas evodiamine exhibited competitive inhibition at the active site. ADMET analysis highlighted favorable pharmacokinetic properties for berberine, evodiamine, and sanguinarine, while reserpine and matrine exhibited limited bioavailability due to solubility and size constraints. The unique inhibitory mechanisms observed were consistent with the structural and physicochemical properties of the compounds. These findings establish berberine, evodiamine, and reserpine as promising SQLE inhibitors, with evodiamine emerging as a lead candidate.",

      "abstract": "Recently, there has been burgeoning interest in the involvement of cholesterol metabolism in cancer. Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), as a critical rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, has garnered attention due to its overexpression in various cancer types, thereby significantly impacting tumor prognosis and resistance mechanisms. Firstly, SQLE contributes to unfavorable prognosis through diverse mechanisms, encompassing modulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, manipulation of the cancer microenvironment, and participation in ferroptosis. Secondly, directing efforts towards targeting SQLE, via mechanisms such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, presents promising avenues for overcoming resistance to conventional therapies such as endocrine cancer therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy. Moreover, the effectiveness of SQLE protein inhibitors in impeding cancer progression may either depend directly on SQLE inhibition or function through alternative pathways separate from SQLE. This mini-review offers insights into the intricate mechanisms through which SQLE affects the prognosis and resistance profiles across diverse cancer types, while succinctly elucidating the mechanisms underpinning the anticancer effects of SQLE protein inhibitors. Furthermore, this mini-review underscores the necessity for further investigations into the interplay between SQLE and cancer, proposing potential avenues for future research, with the aim of serving as a reference for exploring the mechanisms governing the role of SQLE in cancer regulation.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic disorders have been identified as one of the causes of drug-induced liver injury; however, the direct regulatory mechanism regarding this disorder has not yet been clarified. In this study, a single regulatory mechanism of small molecule kinase inhibitors, with crizotinib as the representative drug is elucidated. First, it is discovered that crizotinib induced aberrant lipid metabolism and apoptosis in the liver. A mechanistic study revealed that crizotinib treatment promoted the accumulation of squalene epoxidase (SQLE) by inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion which blocked the autophagic degradation of SQLE. A maladaptive increase in SQLE led to disturbances in cholesterol and sphingolipid metabolism via an enzymatic activity-dependent manner. Abnormal cholesterol results in both steatosis and inflammatory infiltration, and disturbances in sphingolipid metabolism promote cell apoptosis by inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization. The restoration of the level or activity of SQLE ameliorated steatosis and hepatocyte injury. The autophagy activator known as metformin or the SQLE enzymatic inhibitor known as terbinafine has potential clinical use for alleviating crizotinib hepatotoxicity.",

The pest is known for developing resistance to several classical acaricides. The study was aimed at the exploration of botanical acaricide for the management of TSSM, T. urticae. Adulticidal action of ethyl acetate, ethanol and water extracts of leaves of Sesbania grandiflora (Fabaceae) were tested on T. urticae. The results showed that ethyl acetate extract showed the maximum mite mortality of 94.44 per cent, followed by ethanol extract at 87.78 per cent at 5 per cent concentration. LC50 of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts were 1.00 and 4.19 per cent, respectively. The aqueous extract gave 94.44 per cent mortality at a very high concentration of 15% with LC50 of 8.57%. Molecules from the GC-MS analysis of S. grandiflora ethyl acetate leaf extract were subjected to molecular docking using acetylcholine esterase as the target molecule. The major phytomolecules identified in the ethyl acetate leaf extract of S. grandiflora were stigmasterol (15.45%), phytol (13.60%), beta-amyrone (8.72%), and squalene (7.51%). Squalene, a biomolecule with the lowest binding energy was selected from the docking result. The toxicity of squalene was evident from the fact that it caused 81.11, 85.55 and 87.78 per cent mortality at 1800, 2000 and 2200 ppm, respectively at 48 h after treatment. After, 72 h, 100 per cent mortality was recorded at 1800 ppm. This study reveals that squalene can be formulated and used as the best alternative to tackle T. urticae.",

Host-directed therapy (HDT) using immunomodulators shows promise in enhancing treatment efficacy by modulating immune responses, thereby shortening the duration of therapy and reducing drug resistance risks. This study investigated the immunomodulatory potential of combining Heat-killed Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (hBCG) with a Squalene-based oil-in-Water Emulsion (SWE) adjuvant against TB. The therapeutic efficacy of the hBCG-SWE regimen was assessed in a guinea pig model infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Furthermore, the impact of hBCG-SWE on TNF-α and MCP-1 production was evaluated in RAW264.7 macrophages, examining the role of TLR2/4 and MyD88 signaling pathways using ELISA, both with and without specific inhibitors. Our findings revealed that hBCG-SWE significantly enhanced TNF-α and MCP-1 production compared to hBCG alone, indicating activation through TLR2/4 and MyD88-dependent pathways. In guinea pigs, hBCG-SWE administration led to notable reductions in lung pathology and spleen bacterial loads versus control groups. These results highlight the capacity of hBCG-SWE to boost innate immunity and provide robust protection against M. tb. Future research should focus on evaluating the ability of hBCG-SWE to shorten conventional chemotherapy and exploring ways to amplify its immunomodulatory efficacy through advanced formulation techniques."

      "abstract": "Squalene synthase (SQS) plays a crucial role in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Its distinctive strategic position makes it a promising candidate for targeting and developing new anti-hypercholesterolemic agents. To uncover novel phytochemical scaffolds as potential inhibitors of SQS, we employed a structure-based virtual screening approach that involves screening 545 phytochemicals collected from Moroccan aromatic and medicinal plants and filtering them based on RMSD values and their affinity towards the target enzyme. Furthermore, we visualized the interacting amino acid residues to gain insight into the 2D and 3D interactions. The docking process was validated through the re-docking method with the reference co-crystallized complex (PDB id = 3v66, SQS-D3A). The screening resulted in the identification of two phytochemicals, Apigenin 7-O-rutinoside, and Apigenin 7-O-glucuronide, with high affinity for SQS binding sites. Both phytochemicals interact with functionally essential residues of SQS. The drug-likeness and toxicity of the phytochemicals were assessed through ADME-Tox analysis. Later, molecular dynamics simulations were performed by GROMACS software for 100 ns to evaluate the stability and fluctuations of protein-ligand complexes. By examining the trajectories produced by the MD simulations, we monitored complex stability, fluctuation, atomic gyration, H-bond, PCA, and FES. The simulations demonstrated that the interaction between the target and the compounds was stable and consistent. Binding free energy calculations indicated that Apigenin 7-O-rutinoside and Apigenin 7-O-glucuronide exhibited higher binding free energy than the co-crystallized inhibitor (D3A), providing a basis for further research in vitro and in vivo to develop potent SQS inhibitors for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia."

      "abstract": "Metabolic-related diseases are chronic diseases caused by multiple factors, such as genetics and the environment. These diseases are difficult to cure and seriously affect human health. Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), the second rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, plays an important role in cholesterol synthesis and alters the gut microbiota and tumor immunity. Research has shown that SQLE is expressed in many tissues and organs and is involved in the occurrence and development of various metabolic-related diseases, such as cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. SQLE inhibitors, such as terbinafine, NB598, natural compounds, and their derivatives, can effectively ameliorate fungal infections, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cancer. In this review, we provide an overview of recent research progress on the role of SQLE in metabolic-related diseases. Further research on the regulation of SQLE expression is highly important for developing drugs for the treatment of metabolic-related diseases with good pharmacological activity.",

      "abstract": "We have investigated the impact of gemcitabine (Gem) and deuterated gemcitabine-squalene (GemSQ-d6) nanoparticles (NPs) on MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines by Raman spectroscopy. Quantification of LDL expression levels in both cell lines revealed a four-fold increase in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to MCF7 cells. In in vitro antitumor assessments, Gem displayed 13.5 times more effectiveness than GemSQ NPs against MCF7 cells, whereas GemSQ NPs induced a 14-fold increase in cytotoxicity compared to Gem for MDA-MB-231 cells. Oil Red O staining revealed that the treatment with GemSQ-d6 NPs induced a higher accumulation of lipid droplets at the periphery of the nucleus in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to MCF7 cells. Raman spectroscopy was employed to assess the impact of these drugs (50 µM, 24 hrs) on these breast cancer cell lines. By using the silent region (2000-2400 cm-1), we demonstrated that the accumulation of the GemSQ-d6 bioconjugate was higher in the cytoplasm of MDA-MB-231 cells than in MCF7 cells. This difference in drug accumulation is likely correlated with their expression levels of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR). However, no information was obtained on Gem in this spectral region. We identified Raman features of squalene (SQ) in 700-1800 cm-1 fingerprint region that allowed us to observe almost the same distribution of GemSQ as that observed in the silent region for both cell lines treated with GemSQ-d6 or SQ-d6. Subsequently, the effects of Gem and GemSQ-d6 on cellular components such as proteins, nucleic acids, and cytochrome C were monitored within the fingerprint spectral region. Our results revealed distinct features in the subcellular accumulation of these biomolecules in response to Gem and GemSQ treatments.",

      "abstract": "There is an emerging necessity for improved therapies against Candida-related infections, with significant implications for global healthcare. Current antifungal agents, limited in number, target specific pathways, but resistance remains a concern. Flucytosine (5FC) exhibits antifungal activity, particularly against Candida. However, monotherapy efficacy is limited, necessitating combination treatments. Herein, we report PEGylated squalene-based nanocarriers for 5FC loading, aiming to enhance its monotherapy efficacy against Candida strains. The loading of 5FC within micelles was achieved using the ultrasound-assisted solvent evaporation method. The 5FC-loaded micelles, together with non-loaded micelles, were thoroughly characterized and analyzed. STEM and DLS analysis confirmed the core-shell morphology with nanometric dimensions along with improved colloidal stability. The quantification of drug loading efficiency and drug loading capacity was calculated using the UV-Vis technique. The in vitro drug-release studies in simulated physiological conditions showed sustained release within 48 hours. Moreover, the release kinetics calculated using mathematical models showed a Fickian diffusion drug release mechanism in simulated physiological conditions with a slower diffusion rate. The in vitro antifungal activity was tested on Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis. The results showed improved antifungal activity for the nanotherapeutic and unchanged in vitro toxicity toward normal cells, suggesting promising advancements in 5FC therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over the past decades, the increasing incidence of recurrent dermatophytosis associated with terbinafine-resistant Trichophyton has posed a serious challenge in management of dermatophytosis. Independent reports of failure of treatment and high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antifungals are available, but data correlating MIC and clinical outcomes is still sparse. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the outcomes of systemic treatment of dermatophytosis and its correlation with MIC of the etiological agents isolated from such patients. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 587 consecutive patients with dermatophytosis was done from March 2017 to March 2019. Demographic and clinical details of the patients were noted, along with the results of direct microscopy and fungal culture. The isolates were identified by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed following the CLSI M38 protocol. Mutation in the squalene epoxidase (SE) gene was detected by DNA sequencing and ARMS-PCR. Based on the culture-positivity and prescribed systemic antifungal, patients were categorised into Group I culture-positive cases treated with systemic terbinafine and Group II culture-positive cases treated with systemic itraconazole, each for a total period of 12 weeks. RESULTS: In the present study, 477 (81.39%) were culture-positive; however, 12 weeks follow-up was available for 294 patients (Group I-157 and Group II-137) who were included for statistical analysis. In both groups [Group I-37/63 (51.4%) and Group II-14/54 (58.3%)], a better cure rate was observed if the initiation of therapy was performed within <6 months of illness. Treatment outcome revealed that if therapy was extended for 8-12 weeks, the odds of cure rate are significantly better (p < .001) with either itraconazole (Odd Ratio-15.5) or terbinafine (Odd Ratio-4.34). Higher MICs for terbinafine were noted in 41 cases (cured-18 and uncured-23) in Group I and 39 cases (cured-16 and uncured-23) in Group II. From cured (Group I-17/18; 94.4% and Group II-14/16; 87.5%) and uncured (Group I-20/23; 86.9% and Group II-21/23; 91.3%) cases had F397L mutation in the SE gene. No significant difference in cure rate was observed in patients with Trichophyton spp. having terbinafine MIC ≥ 1or <1 μg/mL (Group I-p = .712 and Group II-p = .69). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that prolonging terbinafine or itraconazole therapy for beyond 8 weeks rather than the standard 4 weeks significantly increases the cure rate. Moreover, no correlation has been observed between antifungal susceptibility and clinical outcomes. The MIC remains the primary parameter for defining antifungal activity and predicting the potency of antifungal agents against specific fungi. However, predicting therapeutic success based solely on the MIC of a fungal strain is not always reliable, as studies have shown a poor correlation between in vitro data and in vivo outcomes. To address this issue, further correlation of antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) data with clinical outcomes and therapeutic drug monitoring is needed. It also highlights that initiation of the treatment within <6 months of illness increases cure rates and reduces recurrence. Extensive research is warranted to establish a better treatment regime for dermatophytosis.",

      "abstract": "De novo hair follicle (HF) regeneration, achieved through the replenishment of the dermal papilla (DP), acknowledged as the principal orchestrator of the hair growth cycle, is emerging as a prospective therapeutic intervention for alopecia. Nonetheless, multiple attempts have shown that these cells lose key inductive properties when cultured in a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer, leading to precocious senescence engendered by oxidative stress and inflammatory processes. Consequently, the three-dimensional (3D) spheroid technique is presently widely employed for DP cell culture. Nevertheless, substantiating the regenerative potential of these cells within the hair follicle (HF) milieu remains a challenge. In this current study, we aim to find a new approach to activate the inductive properties of DP cells. This involves the application of hair-growth-stimulating agents that not only exhibit concurrent protective efficacy against the aging process but also induce HF regeneration. To achieve this objective, we initially synthesized a novel highly amphiphilic derivative derived from squalene (SQ), named triethylene glycol squalene (Tri-SQ). Squalene itself is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound traditionally employed as a drug carrier for alopecia treatment. However, its application is limited due to its low solubility. Subsequently, we applied this newly synthesized derivative to DP cells. The data obtained demonstrated that the derivative exhibits robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities while concurrently promoting the expression of genes associated with hair growth. Moreover, to further assess the hair regrowth inductive properties of DP cells, we cultured the cells and treated them with Tri-SQ within a 3D spheroid system. Subsequently, these treated cells were injected into the previously depilated dorsal area of six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. Results revealed that 20 days postinjection, a complete regrowth of hair in the previously hairless area, particularly evident in the case of 3D spheroids treated with the derivative, was observed. Additionally, histological and molecular analyses demonstrated an upregulation of markers associated with hair growth and a concurrent decrease in aging hallmarks, specifically in the 3D spheroids treated with the compound. In summary, our approach, which involves the treatment of Tri-SQ combined with a 3D spheroid system, exhibited a notably robust stimulating effect. This effect was observed in the induction of inductive properties in DP cells, leading to HF regeneration, and concurrently, it demonstrated an inhibitory effect on cellular and follicular aging."

      "abstract": "Terbinafine resistance has become epidemic as an emerging problem in treatment of dermatohpytosis. This could be attributed in part to a point mutation in the squalene epoxidase (SQLE) gene. In this study, point mutations in the SQLE gene were studied in T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes/T. interdigitale species complex as two main causative agents of dermatophytosis. Antifungal susceptibility of clinical isolates of T. rubrum (n = 27) and T. mentagrophytes/T. interdigitale (n = 56) was assessed using the M38-3rd edition CLSI method. The SQLE gene and ITS region were sequenced for all the fungal strains, and the mutation sites and genotypes of the terbinafine-resistant strains were characterized. The results demonstrated that, in T. rubrum, the minimum inhibitory concentration of terbinafine (MIC50 and MIC90) was 0.03 μg/ml, and the geometric mean (G mean) concentration was 0.02. For the T. mentagrophytes complex, the MIC50 and MIC90 were 0.03 and 1.0 μg/ml, respectively, and the G mean concentration was 0.04 μg/ml. Four out of the five resistant strains were T. indotineae harboring the F397L and Q408L mutations, while the last one was T. mentagrophytes genotype VII, which harbors the F397L mutation. T. indotineae was the prominent causative agent of terbinafine resistance, with 80 % of the isolates, and T. mentagrophytes genotype VII was introduced as a new genotype in the terbinafine-resistant T. mentagrophytes complex. Our findings further substantiate the importance of antifungal susceptibility testing in selecting the choice of drug for effective treatment of dermatophytosis and highlight the importance of screening dermatophyte species for point mutations responsible for newly developed resistant strains to improve the current knowledge of overcoming infections caused by resistant species.",

Spectral analysis of purified pentane fraction of coconut leaves revealed the presence of a squalene analog named 4,4'-diapophytofluene or in short 4,4'-DPE (C30H46). Pure squalene standard (PSQ) showed cytotoxicity after 8 µg/ml concentration whereas 4,4'-DPE exhibited no cytotoxic effects up to 16 µg/ml concentration. On senescence-induced WI38 cells, 4,4'-DPE displayed better percentage of cell viability (164.5% at 24 h, 159.4% at 48 h and 148% at 72 h) compared to PSQ and BSQ (bio-source squalene) with same time duration. Similar trend of result was found in HaCaT cells. SA-β-gal assay showed that number of β-galactosidase positive cells were significantly decreased in senescent cells (WI38 and HaCaT) after treated with 4,4'-DPE than PSQ, BSQ. Percentage of ROS was increased to 60% in WI38 cells after olaparib treatment. When PSQ, BSQ and 4,4'-DPE were applied separately on these oxidative-stress-induced cells for 48 h, the overall percentage of ROS was decreased to 39.3%, 45.6% and 19.3% respectively. This 4,4'-DPE was found to be more effective in inhibiting senescence by removing ROS as compared to squalene. Therefore, this 4,4'-DPE would be new potent senotherapeutic agent for pharmaceuticals and dermatological products.",

Disruption of squalene epoxidase (SQLE) has been implicated in metabolic disorders and cancer. However, the role of SQLE as a monooxygenase involved in oxidative stress remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed the expression and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and LUSC samples from GEO and TCGA databases. The proliferative activity of the tumors after intervention of SQLE was verified by cell and animal experiments. JC-1 assay, flow cytometry, and Western blot were used to show changes in apoptosis after intervention of SQLE. Flow cytometry and fluorescence assay of ROS levels were used to indicate oxidative stress status. RESULTS: We investigated the unique role of SQLE expression in the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of LUSC. Knockdown of SQLE or treatment with the SQLE inhibitor terbinafine can suppress the proliferation of LUSC cells by inducing apoptosis and reactive oxygen species accumulation. However, depletion of SQLE also results in the impairment of lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis resistance such as upregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4. Therefore, prevention of SQLE in synergy with glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibitor RSL3 effectively mitigates the proliferation and growth of LUSC. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that the low expression of SQLE employs adaptive survival through regulating the balance of apoptosis and ferroptosis resistance. In future, the combinational therapy of targeting SQLE and ferroptosis could be a promising approach in treating LUSC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While de novo cholesterol biosynthesis plays a crucial role in chemotherapy resistance of colorectal cancer (CRC), the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. METHODS: We conducted cell proliferation assays on CRC cells with or without depletion of squalene epoxidase (SQLE), with or without 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment. Additionally, a xenograft mouse model was utilized to explore the impact of SQLE on the chemosensitivity of CRC to 5-FU. RNA-sequencing analysis and immunoblotting analysis were performed to clarify the mechanism. We further explore the effect of SQLE depletion on the ubiquitin of NF-κB inhibitor alpha (IκBα) and (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene on the binding of IκBα to beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (BTRC) by using immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, a cohort of 272 CRC patients were selected for our clinical analyses. RESULTS: Mechanistically, (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene promotes IκBα degradation and subsequent NF-κB activation by enhancing the interaction between BTRC and IκBα. Activated NF-κB upregulates the expression of baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (BIRC3), sustains tumor cell survival after 5-FU treatment and promotes 5-FU resistance of CRC in vivo. Notably, the treatment of terbinafine, an inhibitor of SQLE commonly used as antifungal drug in clinic, enhances the sensitivity of CRC to 5-FU in vivo. Additionally, the expression of SQLE is associated with the prognosis of human CRC patients with 5-FU-based chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, our finding not only demonstrates a new role of SQLE in chemoresistance of CRC, but also reveals a novel mechanism of (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene-dependent NF-κB activation, implicating the combined potential of terbinafine for 5-FU-based CRC treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) promotes metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (MASH-HCC), but its role in modulating the tumour immune microenvironment in MASH-HCC remains unclear. DESIGN: We established hepatocyte-specific Sqle transgenic (tg) and knockout mice, which were subjected to a choline-deficient high-fat diet plus diethylnitrosamine to induce MASH-HCC. SQLE function was also determined in orthotopic and humanised mice. Immune landscape alterations of MASH-HCC mediated by SQLE were profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Hepatocyte-specific Sqle tg mice exhibited a marked increase in MASH-HCC burden compared with wild-type littermates, together with decreased tumour-infiltrating functional IFN-γ+ and Granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells while enriching Arg-1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Conversely, hepatocyte-specific Sqle knockout suppressed tumour growth with increased cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and reduced Arg-1+ MDSCs, inferring that SQLE promotes immunosuppression in MASH-HCC. Mechanistically, SQLE-driven cholesterol accumulation in tumour microenvironment underlies its effect on CD8+ T cells and MDSCs. SQLE and its metabolite, cholesterol, impaired CD8+ T cell activity by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. Cholesterol depletion in vitro abolished the effect of SQLE-overexpressing MASH-HCC cell supernatant on CD8+ T cell suppression and MDSC activation, whereas cholesterol supplementation had contrasting functions on CD8+ T cells and MDSCs treated with SQLE-knockout supernatant. Targeting SQLE with genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibitor, terbinafine, rescued the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in MASH-HCC models. CONCLUSION: SQLE induces an impaired antitumour response in MASH-HCC via attenuating CD8+ T cell function and augmenting immunosuppressive MDSCs. SQLE is a promising target in boosting anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for MASH-HCC.",

Squalene was extracted from pumpkin seed oil with a novel method. Then, the microemulsion form of squalene was prepared for sublingual usage. In the clinical study, among 850 admitted patients, 602 eligible COVID-19 patients were divided in two groups of control (N = 301) and cases (N = 301) between Nov 2021 and Jan 2022. Groups were statistically the same in terms of age, sex, BMI, lymphocyte count on 1st admission day, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory disease, immunosuppressive disease, and required standard treatments. The treatment group received five drops of sublingual squalene every 4 h for 5 days plus standard treatment, while the control group received only standard treatment. Patients were followed up for 30 days after discharge from the hospital. The sublingual form of squalene in the microemulsion form was associated with a significant decrease in the mortality rate (p < 0.001), in which 285 (94.7%) cases were alive after one month while 245 (81.4%) controls were alive after 1 month of discharge from the hospital. In addition, squalene appears to be effective in preventing re-hospitalization due to COVID-19 (p < 0.001), with 141 of controls (46.8%) versus 58 cases (19.3%). This study suggests sublingual squalene in the microemulsion as an effective drug for reducing mortality and re-hospitalization rates in COVID-19 patients.Trial Registration Number: IRCT20200927048848N3.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma (OSA) presents a clinical challenge and has a low 5-year survival rate. Currently, the lack of advanced stratification models makes personalized therapy difficult. This study aims to identify novel biomarkers to stratify high-risk OSA patients and guide treatment. METHODS: We combined 10 machine-learning algorithms into 101 combinations, from which the optimal model was established for predicting overall survival based on transcriptomic profiles for 254 samples. Alterations in transcriptomic, genomic and epigenomic landscapes were assessed to elucidate mechanisms driving poor prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) unveiled genes overexpressed in OSA cells as potential therapeutic targets, one of which was validated via tissue staining, knockdown and pharmacological inhibition. We characterized changes in multiple phenotypes, including proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, chemosensitivity and in vivo tumourigenicity. RNA-seq and Western blotting elucidated the impact of squalene epoxidase (SQLE) suppression on signalling pathways. RESULTS: The artificial intelligence-derived prognostic index (AIDPI), generated by our model, was an independent prognostic biomarker, outperforming clinicopathological factors and previously published signatures. Incorporating the AIDPI with clinical factors into a nomogram improved predictive accuracy. For user convenience, both the model and nomogram are accessible online. Patients in the high-AIDPI group exhibited chemoresistance, coupled with overexpression of MYC and SQLE, increased mTORC1 signalling, disrupted PI3K-Akt signalling, and diminished immune infiltration. ScRNA-seq revealed high expression of MYC and SQLE in OSA cells. Elevated SQLE expression correlated with chemoresistance and worse outcomes in OSA patients. Therapeutically, silencing SQLE suppressed OSA malignancy and enhanced chemosensitivity, mediated by cholesterol depletion and suppression of the FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, the SQLE-specific inhibitor FR194738 demonstrated anti-OSA effects in vivo and exhibited synergistic effects with chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSIONS: AIDPI is a robust biomarker for identifying the high-risk subset of OSA patients. The SQLE protein emerges as a metabolic vulnerability in these patients, providing a target with translational potential.",

      "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Although the treatment and survival rate of BC are being improved, the risk factors and the underlying mechanisms causing BC are incompletely understood. Squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) has been associated with the occurrence and development of multiple cancers but whether it contributes to BC development is unclear. In this study, we performed bioinformatics analysis on paired BC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues and found that SQLE expression is significantly upregulated in BC samples. Knockdown of SQLE impairs viability, induces apoptosis, and inhibits the migration and invasion of BC cells. RNA-seq data reveals that SQLE deficiency leads to dysregulated expression of genes regulating proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Mass spectrometry-directed interactome screening identifies proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an SQLE-interacting protein and overexpression of PCNA partially rescues the impaired viability, migration, and invasion of BC cells caused by SQLE knockdown. In addition, we performed xenograft assays and confirmed that SQLE deficiency inhibits BC growth in vivo. In conclusion, these data suggest that SQLE promotes BC development and SQLE inhibition may be therapeutically useful in BC treatment.",

We previously showed that treatment of human hepatoma cell line HepG2 with prepared PL hydroperoxide (PLOOH) resulted in ferroptosis. However, in human sebum, the major hydroperoxide is not PLOOH but squalene hydroperoxide (SQOOH), and to our knowledge, it is not established yet whether SQOOH induces ferroptosis in the skin. In this study, we synthesized SQOOH and treated human keratinocyte HaCaT cells with SQOOH. The results showed that SQOOH induces ferroptosis in HaCaT cells in the same way that PLOOH causes ferroptosis in HepG2 cells. Some natural antioxidants (botanical extracts) could inhibit the ferroptosis in both the cell types. Consequently, future research focus would revolve around the involvement of SQOOH-induced ferroptosis in skin pathologies as well as the prevention and treatment of skin diseases through inhibition of ferroptosis by botanical extracts.",

Conventional medication formulations often encounter issues of instability or insolubility in biological environments, resulting in low bioavailability. Nanocarriers play a crucial role in transporting and safeguarding drugs at specific sites of action, enabling gradual release under particular conditions. This study focuses on methotrexate (MTx) and cytarabine (Cyt), essential antitumoral drugs, loaded into PEGylated squalene micellar structures to enhance therapeutic effectiveness and minimize drawbacks. The micelles were prepared using ultrasound-assisted methods in both water and phosphate buffer saline solutions. Evaluation of drug-loaded micelles encompassed parameters such as particle size, colloidal stability, surface charge, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, drug loading capacity, and in vitro release profiles under simulated physiological and tumoral conditions. In vitro cell inhibition studies conducted on MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines demonstrated higher antitumoral activity for the drug-encapsulated micelles compared to free drugs. The encapsulation effectively addressed the burst effect, providing sustained release for at least 48 h while enhancing the drug's protection under physiological conditions."

      "abstract": "Elevated expression of c-MYC and inactivation of p53 represent two of the most common alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, c-MYC and defective p53 are difficult to target therapeutically. Therefore, effectors downstream of both c-MYC and p53 may represent attractive, alternative targets for cancer treatment. In a bioinformatics screen we identified Squalene epoxidase/SQLE as a candidate therapeutic target that appeared to be especially relevant for cell survival in CRCs, which display elevated c-MYC expression and loss of p53 function. SQLE is a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis. Here, we show that p53 supresses SQLE expression, cholesterol levels, and cell viability via the induction of miR-205, which directly targets SQLE. Furthermore, c-MYC induced SQLE expression directly and via its target gene AP4. The transcription factor AP4/TFAP4 directly induced SQLE expression and cholesterol levels, whereas inactivation of AP4 resulted in decreased SQLE expression and caused resistance to Terbinafine, an inhibitor of SQLE. Inhibition of SQLE decreased viability of CRC cells. This effect was enhanced in CRCs cells with p53 inactivation and/or enhanced c-MYC/AP4 expression. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SQLE represents a vulnerability for CRCs with p53 inactivation and elevated c-MYC activity.",

      "abstract": "Reperfusion injuries after a period of cardiac ischemia are known to lead to pathological modifications or even death. Among the different therapeutic options proposed, adenosine, a small molecule with platelet anti-aggregate and anti-inflammatory properties, has shown encouraging results in clinical trials. However, its clinical use is severely limited because of its very short half-life in the bloodstream. To overcome this limitation, we have proposed a strategy to encapsulate adenosine in squalene-based nanoparticles (NPs), a biocompatible and biodegradable lipid. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess, whether squalene-based nanoparticles loaded with adenosine (SQAd NPs) were cardioprotective in a preclinical cardiac ischemia/reperfusion model. Obtained SQAd NPs were characterized in depth and further evaluated in vitro. The NPs were formulated with a size of about 90 nm and remained stable up to 14 days at both 4 °C and room temperature. Moreover, these NPs did not show any signs of toxicity, neither on HL-1, H9c2 cardiac cell lines, nor on human PBMC and, further retained their inhibitory platelet aggregation properties. In a mouse model with experimental cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, treatment with SQAd NPs showed a reduction of the area at risk, as well as of the infarct area, although not statistically significant. However, we noted a significant reduction of apoptotic cells on cardiac tissue from animals treated with the NPs. Further studies would be interesting to understand how and through which mechanisms these nanoparticles act on cardiac cells."

Widely known EC has a strongly positive correlation with abnormal lipid metabolism. Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), a crucial enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway regulating lipid metabolic processes has been found to be associated with various cancers in recent years. Here, we focused on studying the role of SQLE in EC. Our study revealed that SQLE expression level was upregulated significantly in EC tissues. In vitro experiments showed that SQLE overexpression significantly promoted the proliferation, and inhibited cell apoptosis of EC cells, whereas SQLE knockdown or use of terbinafine showed the opposite results. Furthermore, we found out that the promotional effect of SQLE on the proliferation of EC cells might be achieved by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. In vivo, studies confirmed that the knockdown of SQLE or terbinafine can observably inhibit tumor growth in nude mice. These results indicate that SQLE may promote the progression of EC by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, SQLE is a potential target for EC treatment and its inhibitor, terbinafine, has the potential to become a targeted drug for EC treatment.",

In this study, a squalene synthase gene from T. grandis, TgSQS, was identified and functionally characterized. TgSQS encodes a deduced protein of 410 amino acids. Prokaryotic expression of the TgSQS protein could catalyze farnesyl diphosphate to produce squalene. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TgSQS showed a significant increase in the content of both squalene and β-sitosterol; moreover, their drought tolerance was also stronger than that of the wild type. Transcriptome data from T. grandis seedlings showed that the expression levels of sterol biosynthesis pathway-related genes, such as HMGS, HMGR, MK, DXS, IPPI, FPPS, SQS, and DWF1, increased significantly after drought treatment. We also demonstrated that TgWRKY3 directly bound to the TgSQS promoter region and regulated its expression through a yeast one-hybrid experiment and a dual luciferase experiment. Together, these findings demonstrate that TgSQS has a positive role in β-sitosterol biosynthesis and in protecting against drought stress, emphasizing its importance as a metabolic engineering tool for the simultaneous improvement of β-sitosterol biosynthesis and drought tolerance."

      "abstract": "Aralia elata is an important herb due to the abundance of pentacyclic triterpenoid saponins whose important precursors are squalene and OA. Here, we found that MeJA treatment promoted both precursors accumulation, especially the latter, in transgenic A. elata, overexpressing a squalene synthase gene from Panax notoginseng(PnSS). In this study, Rhizobium-mediated transformation was used to express the PnSS gene. Gene expression analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to identify the effect of MeJA on squalene and OA accumulation. The PnSS gene was isolated and expressed in A. elata. Transgenic lines showed a very high expression of the PnSS gene and farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene (AeFPS) and a slightly higher squalene content than the wild-type, but endogenous squalene synthase (AeSS), squalene epoxidase (AeSE), and β-amyrin synthase (Aeβ-AS) gene were decreased as well as OA content. Following one day of MeJA treatment, the expression levels of PeSS, AeSS, and AeSE genes increased significantly. On day 3, the maximum content of both products reached 17.34 and 0.70 mg·g-1, which increased 1.39- and 4.90-fold than in the same lines without treatment. Transgenic lines expressing PnSS gene had a limited capability to promote squalene and OA accumulation. MeJA strongly activated their biosynthesis pathways, leading to enhance yield.",

In this study, the antioxidant activity was detected by 2,2-diphenyl-1-acrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test and fluorescent probe (dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate). Transgenic Tg (lyz: DsRed2) zebrafish were used to evaluate the effect of squalene on CuSO4-induced inflammatory response. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the expression of immune-related genes. The DPPH assay demonstrated that the highest free radical scavenging exerted by squalene was 32%. The fluorescence intensity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) decreased significantly after 0.7% or 1% squalene treatment, and squalene could exert an antioxidative effect in vivo. The number of migratory neutrophils in vivo was significantly reduced after treatment with different doses of squalene. Moreover, compared with CuSO4 treatment alone, treatment with 1% squalene upregulated the expression of sod by 2.5-foldand gpx4b by 1.3-fold to protect zebrafish larvae against CuSO4-induced oxidative damage. Moreover, treatment with 1% squalene significantly downregulated the expression of tnfa and cox2. This study showed that squalene has potential as an aquafeed additive to provide both anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the species distribution and prevalence of squalene epoxidase mutations among toenail dermatophyte isolates. Samples from 15,683 patients suspected of onychomycosis visiting the offices of dermatologists and podiatrists in the United States were analyzed. Clinical information was reviewed, and dermatophyte species with or without squalene epoxidase mutations were detected using multiplex real-time PCRs. The frequency of dermatophytes was 37.6%; of isolates belonging to the Trichophyton genus, 88.3% were the T. rubrum complex, and 11.2% were the T. mentagrophytes complex. Individuals aged >70 years exhibited higher infection rates for the T. mentagrophytes complex. The overall mutation rate among Trichophyton spp. was 3.7%, with a higher mutation rate detected in the T. mentagrophytes complex (4.3 vs. 3.6%). Commonly detected mutations were T1189C/Phe397Leu (34.5%), T1306C/Phe415Ser (16.0%), and C1191A/Phe397Leu (11.0%). Squalene epoxidase gene mutations associated with decreased terbinafine susceptibility have been identified in United States patients with toenail onychomycosis. Physicians should be aware of the risk factors for resistance development and engage in antifungal stewardship practices such as directed diagnosis and treatment of dermatophytosis and onychomycosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Numerous reports of resistance to terbinafine in Trichophyton spp. from all over the world are arousing justified attention and concern. Point mutations in the gene that encodes the squalene epoxidase (SQLE) enzyme are responsible for these therapeutic resistances. OBJECTIVES: Primary objective of the study was to describe first isolates of Trichophyton spp. resistant to terbinafine among the patients treated between September 2019 and June 2022 at the Dermatology Units of Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and San Bortolo Hospital. Secondary objective was to study the resistance mechanism. METHODS: Patients with confirmed Trichophyton spp. infection has been treated with systemic and topical terbinafine. Patients were then re-evaluated 12 weeks after the therapy. Patients with incomplete or absent response to terbinafine underwent a new skin scraping for direct mycological examination, new identification of dermatophyte species from culture and MALDI-TOF, molecular species identification, antifungal susceptibility testing and molecular analysis of SQLE gene. RESULTS: We identified five patients without clinical response to treatment with terbinafine. The DNA sequencing of the ITS region identified one Trichophyton rubrum and four Trichophyton indotineae. The T. rubrum strain showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (90% growth inhibition) of 4 mg/L for terbinafine. The four T. indotineae strains showed a MICs range of 0.25-4 mg/L for terbinafine. The analysis of the SQLE gene in the T. rubrum strain showed a nucleotide substitution generating a missense mutation (L393F). The SQLE gene sequencing in the T. indotineae strains showed a nucleotide substitution generating a missense mutation (F397L) in two strains, a nucleotide substitution L393S in one strain and a nucleotide substitution F415C in another strain. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first cases of terbinafine-resistant Trichophyton isolates in the Italian population. Solid antifungal management programs will be needed to promote more responsible use of antimycotics and preserve their therapeutic efficacy to control antifungal resistance.",

      "abstract": "In the present work, squalene (SQ) was encapsulated by a conventional emulsion method using egg white protein nanoparticles (EWPn) as a high molecular weight surfactant, followed by a freeze-drying process to obtain an SQ powder ingredient. EWPn was produced by heat treatment at 85°C, 10 min, and pH 10.5. EWPn showed higher emulsifying activity regarding native egg white protein (EWP), highlighting their potential to be used for the SQ encapsulation by an emulsification process. First, we explored the encapsulation conditions using pure corn oil as an SQ carrier. Conditions were oil fraction (0.1-0.2), protein amount (2-5 wt.%), homogenization pressure (100 and 200 bar), and maltodextrin amount (10-20 wt.%). At 0.15 oil fraction, 5 wt.%. protein concentration, 200 bar homogenization pressure, and 20% maltodextrin, the highest encapsulation efficiency (EE) was reached. Then, according to these conditions, SQ was encapsulated to obtain a freeze-dried powder ingredient for bread formulation. The total and free oil of SQ freeze-dried powder were 24.4% ± 0.6% and 2.6% ± 0.1%, respectively, resulting in an EE value of 89.5% ± 0.5%. The physical, textural, and sensory properties of functional bread were not affected by the addition of 5.0% SQ freeze-dried powder. Finally, the bread loaves showed higher SQ stability than the one formulated with unencapsulated SQ. Hence, the encapsulation system developed was suitable for obtaining functional bread based on SQ fortification.",

The genes upstream and downstream of CbSE were found to be upregulated, which confirms its regulatory role in the saponin biosynthetic pathway. Chlorophytum borivilianum is a high-value medicinal plant with many promising preclinical applications that include saponins as a major active ingredient. Squalene epoxidase (SE) is one of the major rate-limiting enzymes of the saponin biosynthetic pathway. Here, we functionally characterized C. borivilianum SE (CbSE) by over-expressing heterologously in Nicotiana tabacum. The heterologous expression of CbSE resulted in stunted pant growth with altered leaf and flower morphology. Next, RT-qPCR analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing CbSE revealed increased expression levels of Cycloartenol synthase (CAS), Beta amyrin synthase (βAS), and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 51 (CYP51) (Cytochrome P450), which encode key enzymes for triterpenoid and phytosterol biosynthesis in C. borivilianum. Further, Methyl Jasmonate (MeJa) treatment upregulated Squalene synthase (SQS), SE, and Oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) to a significant level. GC-MS analysis of the leaf and hairy roots of the transformants showed an increased stigmasterol content (0.5-1.0 fold) compared to wild type (WT) plants. These results indicate that CbSE is a rate-limiting gene, which encodes an efficient enzyme responsible for phytosterol and triterpenoid production in C. borivilianum.",

Accordingly, to find the mechanism of CC progression at molecular level is imminent. METHODS: The mRNA expression data were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and squalene epoxidase (SQLE) level in the tumor and adjuvant tissues of CC was analyzed. The pathway enrichment analysis of target mRNAs was performed based on the GSEA database. The cancerous tissues and para-cancerous tissues of CC patients were collected for immunohistochemistry. SQLE and p53 mRNA expression was ensured by qRT-polymerase chain reaction. SQLE and p53 protein levels were determined by western blot. Cell functional assays focused on evaluating the malignant behaviors of cancer cells in each treatment group. Nude mouse xenograft models were constructed for tumorigenicity analysis. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SQLE expression was high in CC tissues, which was linked to the poor prognosis. SQLE could affect the p53 signaling pathway. Cell functional assays demonstrated that SQLE expression was promoted in CC cell lines, and overexpressing SQLE facilitated the malignant phenotypes of CC cells, whereas silencing SQLE suppressed CC progression in vitro and in vivo. Besides, the repressed p53 signaling pathway could reverse the effect caused by silenced SQLE. CONCLUSION: SQLE could promote CC progression by modulating the p53 signaling pathway.",

We previously showed that the rate-limiting and first oxygen-dependent enzyme of the committed cholesterol synthesis pathway, squalene monooxygenase (SM), can undergo partial proteasomal degradation that renders it constitutively active. Here, we show hypoxia is a physiological trigger for this truncation, which occurs through a two-part mechanism: (1) increased targeting of SM to the proteasome via stabilization of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF6 and (2) accumulation of the SM substrate, squalene, which impedes the complete degradation of SM and liberates its truncated form. This preserves SM activity and downstream pathway flux during hypoxia. These results uncover a feedforward mechanism that allows SM to accommodate fluctuating substrate levels and may contribute to its widely reported oncogenic properties.",

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of RJ on gene expression of squalene epoxidase (SE) a major enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis in HepG2 cells. We found that the expression of SE was decreased in response to RJ treatment. We also found that the origin of the RJ affected its strength. To find out the active fraction of RJ in cholesterol suppression, we separated RJ into two parts based on the molecular weights using ultrafiltration membrane. We found that the fraction <10kDa from RJ had comparable effect on SE expression, especially its water-soluble part. Taken together, we think RJ suppresses cholesterol by decreasing SE gene expression in liver. The active fraction of RJ in this action is <10kDa in water-soluble form."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) is a key enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, but growing evidence also reveals that SQLE is abnormally expressed in some types of malignant tumours, even though the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Bioinformatics analysis and RNA sequencing were applied to detect differentially expressed genes in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MTT, colony formation, AnnexinV-FITC/PI, EdU, wound healing, transwell, western blot, qRT-PCR, IHC, F-actin, RNA-sequencing, dual-luciferase reporters, and H&E staining were used to investigate the pharmacological effects and possible mechanisms of SQLE. KEY RESULTS: SQLE expression was specifically elevated in HCC, correlating with poor clinical outcomes. SQLE significantly promoted HCC growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing and functional experiments revealed that the protumourigenic effect of SQLE on HCC was closely related to the activation of TGF-β/SMAD signalling, but the stimulatory effect of SQLE on TGF-β/SMAD signalling and HCC development is critically dependent on STRAP. SQLE expression is well correlated with STRAP in HCC, and further, to amplify TGF-β/SMAD signalling, SQLE even transcriptionally increased STRAP gene expression mediated by AP-2α. Finally, as a chemical inhibitor of SQLE, NB-598 markedly inhibited HCC cell growth and tumour development. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Taken together, SQLE serves as a novel oncogene in HCC development by activating TGF-β/SMAD signalling. Targeting SQLE could be useful in drug development and therapy for HCC.",

The results showed that SQ significantly increased the final body weight (FWB, P < 0.05), average daily gain (ADG, P < 0.05), and average daily feed intake (ADFI, P < 0.05) and significantly decreased the F/G ratio (feed intake/gain, P < 0.05) and diarrhea index (DI, P < 0.05). In terms of blood biochemical indicators, SQ significantly increased anti-inflammatory factors such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β, P < 0.001), interleukin-10 (IL-10, P < 0.001), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ, P < 0.01), and decreased pro-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TFN-α, P < 0.001) and interleukin-6 (IL-6, P < 0.001). Furthermore, SQ significantly increased blood antioxidant indexes (P < 0.001) such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and significantly decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) (P < 0.001). The villus height (P < 0.001) and V/C ratio (villus height/crypt depth, P < 0.001) of the jejunum were significantly increased in the SQ group, while the crypt depth (P < 0.01) was decreased compared to the CON group. The intestinal permeability indexes, namely diamine oxidase (DAO), D-lactic acid (D-Lac), regenerative insulin-derived protein 3 (REG-3), and FITC-Dextran 4 (FD4), significantly decreased the concentrations in the treatment group (P < 0.001), and the antioxidant indexes of the jejunum, such as SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and MDA, were improved by adding SQ. The qPCR results showed that adding SQ could significantly increase the mRNA expression of jejunal tight-junction proteins, such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1, P < 0.001), Occludin (P < 0.001), Claudin (P < 0.001), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2, P < 0.001), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1, P < 0.001). Then, we used Western blotting experiments to further confirm the qPCR results. In addition, it was found that adding SQ increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Gemmiger (P < 0.01) and decreased the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Alloprevotella (P < 0.05), Desulfovibrio (P < 0.05), and Barnesiella (P < 0.05). It was interesting that there was a very close correlation among the fecal microbes, growth performance parameters, intestinal barrier, and blood biochemical indicators. In conclusion, the data suggest that SQ supplementation could effectively improve the growth performance of early-weaned piglets by improving the gut microbiota, intestinal barrier, and antioxidant capacity of the blood and jejunal mucosa."

      "abstract": "Transplantation of pancreatic islets is a promising approach to controlling glucose levels in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), but islet survival is still limited. To overcome this, islet co-culture with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) together with safe immunosuppressive agents like squalene-gusperimus nanoparticles (Sq-GusNPs) may be applied. This could support islet survival and engraftment. Here, we studied how Sq-GusNPs and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) influence islets response under pro-inflammatory conditions. Through qRT-PCR, we studied the expression of specific genes at 24 hours in human and rat islets and ASCs in co-culture under indirect contact with or without treatment with Sq-GusNPs. We characterized how the response of islets and ASCs starts at molecular level before impaired viability or function is observed and how this response differs between species. Human islets and ASCs responses showed to be principally influenced by NF-κB activation, whereas rat islet and ASCs responses showed to be principally mediated by nitrosative stress. Rat islets showed tolerance to inflammatory conditions due to IL-1Ra secretion which was also observed in rat ASCs. Human islets induced the expression of cytokines and chemokines with pro-angiogenic, tissue repair, and anti-apoptotic properties in human ASCs under basal conditions. This expression was not inhibited by Sq-GusNPs. Our results showed a clear difference in the response elicited by human and rat islets and ASCs in front of an inflammatory stimulus and Sq-GusNPs. Our data support the use of ASCs and Sq-GusNP to facilitate engraftment of islets for T1DM treatment.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is the most lethal of all human gynecologic malignancies. We previously reported that vaccination of female mice with the extracellular domain of anti-Müllerian hormone receptor II (AMHR2-ED) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) generates AMHR2-ED specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) that provides prevention and therapy against murine EOCs. Although CFA is the \"gold standard\" adjuvant in animal studies, it is not approved for human use because it often induces painful granulomas and abscesses. Thus, the objective of this study is to identify an alternative adjuvant to CFA for use in our ovarian cancer vaccine clinical trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Because it has been used successfully without serious adverse effects in numerous human clinical trials, we selected the IgG-inducing squalene-based adjuvant, AddaVax™, for evaluation of its ability to facilitate vaccine-induced prevention and treatment of EOC in mice. To this end, we immunized female C57BL/6 mice with recombinant mouse AMHR2-ED emulsified with either AddaVax or CFA as adjuvant and compared the results. RESULTS: We found that formulation of the AMHR2-ED vaccine with AddaVax adjuvant induced high serum titers of IgG and significant inhibition of EOC growth with significantly enhanced overall survival of mice using both prevention and therapeutic protocols. These results were compared favorably with results obtained using CFA as an adjuvant in the AMHR2-ED vaccine. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the AMHR2-ED vaccine formulated with AddaVax may be used in human clinical trials and thereby serve as a novel and effective way to control human EOC."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Considering the dismal prognosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), it is critical to identify novel therapeutic targets in this disease. Malignant cells have metabolic dependencies distinct from their healthy counterparts, resulting in therapeutic vulnerabilities. Although PTEN and TP53 are the most frequently comutated or codeleted driver genes in lethal CRPC, the metabolic dependencies underlying PTEN/p53 deficiency-driven CRPC for therapeutic intervention remain largely elusive. In this study, PTEN/p53 deficient tumors were determined to be reliant on cholesterol metabolism. Moreover, PTEN/p53 deficiency transcriptionally upregulated squalene epoxidase (SQLE) via activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2). In addition, PTEN deficiency enhanced the protein stability of SQLE by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β-mediated proteasomal pathway. Consequently, SQLE increased cholesterol biosynthesis to facilitate tumor cell growth and survival. Pharmacologic blockade of SQLE with FR194738 profoundly suppressed the invasive program of CRPC. Collectively, these results demonstrate a synergistic relationship between SQLE and PTEN/p53 deficiency in CRPC development and progression. Therefore, pharmacologic interventions targeting SQLE may hold promise for the treatment of patients with CRPC. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals PTEN and p53 deficiency confers a dependence on SQLE-mediated cholesterol metabolism, providing insights for new therapeutic strategies for treating castration-resistant prostate cancer.",

However, a successful antitumor response by ICD requires both apoptotic tumor microenvironments and activated immune systems. Ivermectin (IVM) has been shown to induce cell apoptosis through autophagy which can be a great candidate for ICD therapy. However, a single treatment of IVM-free drug is not an ideal anticancer therapy due to its anti-inflammatory effects and cytotoxicity. In the present study, IVM was shown to enhance the ICD process in addition to the treatment of resiquimod (R848), a TLR7/8 agonist, when co-loaded in a squalene-based nanoemulsion (NE). R848-IVM co-loaded NE was developed and characterized in vitro. Antitumor activity of R848-IVM NE was also evaluated in vitro and in vivo. R848-IVM NE exhibited long-term stability and reduced cytotoxicity by IVM. In vivo studies demonstrated that IVM significantly augments the ICD by upregulating Cd8a and releasing HMGB1 in tumor tissue, which could enhance R848-driven antitumor immunity. R848-IVM NE treatment showed strong antitumor activity with over 80% tumor growth inhibition, suggesting a potential combination therapy of systemic co-delivering IVM with TLR agonists against solid cancer.",

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the pharmacological effects of A. lakoocha leaves methanol extract on enzymes involved in the cholesterol synthesis pathway in high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four male Wistar rats, weighing approximately 180-220 g, were divided into four groups: control, diseased (hyperlipidemic), A. lakoocha leaves extract treated, and simvastatin treated. The rats were fed with high-fat diet for 2 months to induce hyperlipidaemia, afterward, experimental groups received A. lakoocha leaves methanol extract (250 mg/kg) and simvastatin (10 mg/kg) orally until the 89th day of the experiment, while the diseased group continued to receive high-fat diet along with normal saline. RESULTS: It was found that A. lakoocha extract significantly lowered the serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, while effectively increasing serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels as compared to the diseased group (p ≤ 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of squalene synthase and HMG-CoA reductase were found to be effectively down-regulated after the treatment with A. lakoocha leaves extract (17.45 ± 2.48 vs. 31.91 ± 5.292 and 5.85 ± 3.164 vs. 37.37 ± 6.492) and simvastatin (7.148 ± 0.76 vs. 31.91 ± 5.292, and 3.098 ± 2.09 vs. 37.37 ± 6.492) as compared to the diseased group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that A. lakoocha leaves extract have observable beneficial effects on inhibition of enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis pathway and improve lipid profile analogous to simvastatin.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy is emerging as a powerful treatment approach for several types of cancers. Modulating the immune system to specifically target cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, is a very promising approach for safer therapies and increased survival of cancer patients. Tumour-associated antigens are favorable targets for cancer immunotherapy, as they are exclusively expressed by the cancer cells, minimizing the risk of an autoimmune reaction. The ability to initiate the activation of the immune system can be achieved by virus-like particles (VLPs) which are safe and potent delivery tools. VLP-based vaccines have evolved dramatically over the last few decades and showed great potential in preventing infectious diseases. Immunogenic potency of engineered VLPs as a platform for the development of effective therapeutic cancer vaccines has been studied extensively. This study involves recombinant VLPs presenting multiple copies of tumour-specific mucin 1 (MUC1) epitope as a potentially powerful tool for future immunotherapy. RESULTS: In this report VLPs based on the structural protein of Norovirus (NoV VP1) were genetically modified to present multiple copies of tumour-specific MUC1 epitope on their surface. Chimeric MUC1 particles were produced in the eukaryotic Leishmania tarentolae expression system and used in combination with squalene oil-in-water emulsion MF59 adjuvant to immunize BALB/c mice. Sera from vaccinated mice demonstrated high titers of IgG and IgM antibodies which were specifically recognizing MUC1 antigen. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results show that immunization with recombinant chimeric NoV VP1- MUC1 VLPs result in high titers of MUC1 specific IgG antibodies and show great therapeutic potential as a platform to present tumour-associated antigens.",

      "abstract": "Amaranthus (Amaranthus caudatus L.) is the richest source of squalene among all plants. Squalene is used as a component of some adjuvants in vaccines for enhancement of the host immune response. Squalene content was estimated by high-performance liquid chromatography and amino acids profiling was performed using an amino acid analyzer. Squalene content, up to 7.66%, was found in the raw seeds of amaranthus, which was further enhanced to 8.13% by popping. The results revealed that amaranthus populations have wide significant variations (p < 0.05) in 1000 seed weight (0.61-1.13 g), protein content (11.50-19.80%), total phenols (4.36-7.82 μg GAE/mg sample), total flavonoid (0.70-2.32 mg QE/g dw), and squalene (3.23-7.66% in raw seeds and 3.38-8.12% in popped seeds). Genotypic variability in amino acids composition, viz. lysine (4.96-5.90%), arginine (8.48-8.80%), leucine (5.20-6.70%), valine (3.60-4.60%), phenylalanine (5.30-8.00%), methionine (3.08-4.97%), tyrosine (5.92-7.96), threonine (3.20-4.32%), and glycine (6.60-8.20%), was also observed. Wide genetic variability in amaranthus grains may be used for improved varietal development breeding programs. It can be further concluded that an increase of squalene content in amaranthus grains by heat treatment could be helpful to fulfil the demands of cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, especially with respect to vaccine production against virus-generated pandemics.",

Squalene synthase (FDFT1) is an upstream enzyme of squalene epoxidase (SQLE) in cholesterol biosynthesis. In a previous study, we revealed that SQLE promotes colon cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Here, we investigate the prognostic value of FDFT1 in stage I-III COAD and explore the potential underlying mechanisms. Squalene synthase was significantly upregulated in stage I-III COAD and positively correlated with poor differentiation and advanced tumor stage. High expression of FDFT1 was an independent predictor of overall and relapse-free survival, and the nomograms based on FDFT1 could effectively identify patients at high risk of poor outcome. Squalene synthase accelerated colon cancer cell proliferation and promoted tumor growth. Lack of FDFT1 resulted in accumulating NAT8 and D-pantethine to lower reactive oxygen species levels and inhibit colon cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, the combined inhibition of FDFT1 and SQLE induced a greater suppressive effect on cell proliferation and tumor growth than single inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that FDFT1 predicts poor prognosis in stage I-III COAD and has the tumor-promoting effect on COAD through regulating NAT8 and D-pantethine. Targeting both FDFT1 and SQLE is a more promising therapy than their single inhibition for stage I-III COAD.",

      "abstract": "Two squalene synthase genes AlSQS1 and AlSQS2 were isolated from Atractylodes lancea and functionally characterized using in vitro enzymatic reactions. Atractylodes lancea is a traditional herb used for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, gastric disorders, and influenza. Its major active ingredients include sesquiterpenoids and triterpenes. Squalene synthase (SQS; EC 2.5.1.21) catalyzes the first enzymatic step in the central isoprenoid pathway towards sterol and triterpenoid biosynthesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate two SQSs from A. lancea using cloning and in vitro enzymatic characterization. Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the AlSQSs exhibited high homology with other plant SQSs. Furthermore, AlSQS1 was observed to be localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas AlSQS2 was localized in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. To obtain soluble recombinant enzymes, AlSQS1 and AlSQS2 were successfully expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli Transetta (DE3). Approximately 68 kDa recombinant proteins were obtained using GST-tag affinity chromatography and Western blot analysis. Results of the in vitro enzymatic reactions established that both AlSQS1 and AlSQS2 were functional, which verifies their catalytic ability in converting two farnesyl pyrophosphates to squalene. The expression patterns of AlSQS and selected terpenoid genes were also investigated in two A. lancea chemotypes using available RNA sequencing data. AlSQS1 and AlSQS2, which showed relatively similar expression in the three tissues, were more highly expressed in the stems than in the leaves and rhizomes. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) was used as an elicitor to analyze the expression profiles of AlSQSs. The results of qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the gene expression of AlSQS1 and AlSQS2 plummeted at lowest value at 12 h and reached its peak at 24 h. This study is the first report on the cloning, characterization, and expression of SQSs in A. lancea. Therefore, our findings contribute novel insights that may be useful for future studies regarding terpenoid biosynthesis in A. lancea.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The T indotineae population shows a high amount of terbinafine resistant isolates based on different point mutations of squalene epoxidase erg1 (ergosterol) gene. A significant proportion of these isolates also show azole resistance. OBJECTIVES: Elucidation of the molecular mechanism for azole resistance, especially the identification of mutations in the sterol 14-α demethylase Erg11 genes, which encode for enzymes interacting with azoles. METHODS: Sequencing of putative Erg11 genes and analysis of phenotypic resistance pattern using a microplate-laser-nephelometry-based growth assay. RESULTS: Four different types of Erg11B mutants were detected; two double mutants with Ala230Thr/Asp441Gly, respectively, Ala230/Tyr444His and single mutants with Gly443Glu, Tyr444Cys and Tyr444His. All isolates featured the wild type genotype of Erg11A. All strains demonstrated different combinations of Erg1 and Erg11 genotypes. CONCLUSION: Resistance against terbinafine and azoles developed several times independently within the T indotineae population. The challenge for fungal treatment is, therefore, that species identification is not enough for prediction of therapeutic efficacy of antifungals. In the future, it will also become important to analyse genes involved in resistance mechanisms.",

Therefore, monitoring the content and distribution of the key enzyme in living cells is very challenging. To achieve this goal, tetraphenyl ethylene-Ter (TPE-Ter) was first designed as a new fluorescent probe to SQLE based on its active cavity. Spectral experiments discovered that SQLE/TPE-Ter shows stronger emission with fast response time and low interference from other analytes. Molecular dynamics simulation clearly confirmed the complex structure of SQLE/TPE-Ter, and the key residues contribute to restriction of TPE-Ter single-molecular motion in the cavity. TPE-Ter-specific response to SQLE is successfully demonstrated in living cells such as LO2, HepG2, and fungi. Imaging of TPE-Ter-treated fungi indicates that it can be used to rapidly assess antifungal drug susceptibility (30 min at least). The present work provides a powerful tool to detect content and distribution of SQLE in living cells.",

      "abstract": "Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) is a rare inborn disease belonging to the family of periodic fever syndromes. The MKD phenotype is characterized by systemic inflammation involving multiple organs, including the nervous system. Current anti-inflammatory approaches to MKD are only partially effective and do not act specifically on neural inflammation. According to the new emerging pharmacology trends, the repositioning of drugs from the indication for which they were originally intended to another one can make mechanistic-based medications easily available to treat rare diseases. According to this perspective, the squalene synthase inhibitor Lapaquistat (TAK-475), originally developed as a cholesterol-lowering drug, might find a new indication in MKD, by modulating the mevalonate cholesterol pathway, increasing the availability of anti-inflammatory isoprenoid intermediates. Using an in vitro model for MKD, we mimicked the blockade of the cholesterol pathway and evaluated the potential anti-inflammatory effect of Lapaquistat. The results obtained showed anti-inflammatory effects of Lapaquistat in association with a low blockade of the metabolic pathway, while this effect did not remain with a tighter blockade. On these bases, Lapaquistat could be configured as an effective treatment for MKD's mild forms, in which the residual enzymatic activity is only reduced and not almost completely absent as in the severe forms.",

      "abstract": "Sterols and squalene are essential biomolecules required for the homeostasis of eukaryotic membrane permeability and fluidity. Both compounds have beneficial effects on human health. As the current sources of sterols and squalene are plant and shark oils, microalgae are suggested as more sustainable sources. Nonetheless, the high costs of production and processing still hinder the commercialization of algal cultivation. Strain improvement for higher product yield and tolerance to harsh environments is an attractive way to reduce costs. Being an intermediate in sterol synthesis, squalene is converted to squalene epoxide by squalene epoxidase. This step is inhibited by terbinafine, a commonly used antifungal drug. In yeasts, some terbinafine-resistant strains overproduced sterols, but similar microalgae strains have not been reported. Mutants that exhibit greater tolerance to terbinafine might accumulate increased sterols and squalene content, along with the ability to tolerate the drug and other stresses, which are beneficial for outdoor cultivation. To explore this possibility, terbinafine-resistant mutants were isolated in the model green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using UV mutagenesis. Three mutants were identified and all of them exhibited approximately 50 percent overproduction of sterols. Under terbinafine treatment, one of the mutants also accumulated around 50 percent higher levels of squalene. The higher accumulation of pigments and triacylglycerol were also observed. Along with resistance to terbinafine, this mutant also exhibited higher resistance to oxidative stress. Altogether, resistance to terbinafine can be used to screen for strains with increased levels of sterols or squalene in green microalgae without growth compromise."

The objective of this study is to provide comprehensive information on lipid squalene nanoparticle (SQ@NP)-adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccines regarding modulating immune response and enhancing vaccine efficacy. After being adjuvanted with SQ@NP, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) subunit protein was intramuscularly (i.m.) administered to mice. Serum samples investigated by ELISA and virus neutralizing assay showed that a single-dose SQ@NP-adjuvanted S-protein vaccine can induce antigen-specific IgG and protective antibodies comparable with those induced by two doses of nonadjuvanted protein vaccine. When the mice received a boosting vaccine injection, anamnestic response was observed in the groups of adjuvanted vaccine. Furthermore, the secretion of cytokines in splenocytes, such as interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-10, was significantly enhanced after adjuvantation of S-protein vaccine with SQ@NP; however, this was not the case for the vaccine adjuvanted with conventional aluminum mineral salts. Histological examination of injection sites showed that the SQ@NP-adjuvanted vaccine was considerably well tolerated following i.m. injection in mice. These results pave the way for the performance tuning of optimal vaccine formulations against COVID-19.",

Thus, we performed transcriptome and metabolite analyses. The results showed that ethylene not only promoted the post-ripening process but also enhanced the accumulation of squalene by inducing gene expression in the mevalonate pathway. At the same time, ethylene treatment also promoted the accumulation of other sterols but inhibited gene expression in the β-sitosterol biosynthesis pathway.

Such acquisition is often underlined by a metabolic reprogramming that can provide a therapeutic opportunity, as it can lead to the emergence of vulnerabilities and dependencies to be exploited as targets against the resistant cells. In this regard, genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) have emerged as powerful tools to integrate multiple layers of data to build cancer-specific models and identify putative metabolic vulnerabilities. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic modelling to reconstruct a GSMM of the THP1 AML cell line and two derivative cell lines, one with acquired resistance to AraC and the second with acquired resistance to DOX. We also explore how, adding to the transcriptomic layer, the metabolomic layer enhances the selectivity of the resulting condition specific reconstructions. The resulting models enabled us to identify and experimentally validate that drug-resistant THP1 cells are sensitive to the FDA-approved antifolate methotrexate. Moreover, we discovered and validated that the resistant cell lines could be selectively targeted by inhibiting squalene synthase, providing a new and promising strategy to directly inhibit cholesterol synthesis in AML drug resistant cells."

Furthermore, the mechanism of resistance to terbinafine in resistant Trichophyton mentagrophytes species was evaluated using the squalene epoxidase (SQLE) gene sequence. Methods: A total of 71 fungal isolates were collected from 97 patients with suspected onychomycosis. The identification of fungal species was performed using conventional and molecular approaches. In vitro drug susceptibility for itraconazole, terbinafine, luliconazole, and efinaconazole was carried out using the broth microdilution method according to the CLSI-M60 and CLSI-M38 3rd ed., respectively. The SQLE gene of one terbinafine-resistant T. mentagrophytes was amplified using the specific primers. Results: Efinaconazole and luliconazole demonstrated higher effectiveness against all isolates in the study. One mismatch was detected at position 1177, which showed A → C change associated with Phe397Leu amino acid substitution of the SQLE protein in terbinafine-resistant T. mentagrophytes. Conclusion: The occurrence of resistant strains of organisms causing onychomycosis should be considered and evaluated.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most malignant tumors with high incidence, yet its molecular mechanism is not fully understood, hindering the development of targeted therapy. Metabolic abnormalities are a hallmark of cancer. Targeting dysregulated metabolic features has become an important direction for modern anticancer therapy. In this study, we aimed to identify a new metabolic enzyme that promotes proliferation of CRC and to examine the related molecular mechanisms. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing and tissue microarray analyses of human CRC samples to identify new genes involved in CRC. Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) was identified to be highly upregulated in CRC patients. The regulatory function of SQLE in CRC progression and the therapeutic effect of SQLE inhibitors were determined by measuring CRC cell viability, colony and organoid formation, intracellular cholesterol concentration and xenograft tumor growth. The molecular mechanism of SQLE function was explored by combining transcriptome and untargeted metabolomics analysis. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to assess MAPK signaling activation by SQLE. RESULTS: SQLE-related control of cholesterol biosynthesis was highly upregulated in CRC patients and associated with poor prognosis. SQLE promoted CRC growth in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of SQLE reduced the levels of calcitriol (active form of vitamin D3) and CYP24A1, followed by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Subsequently, MAPK signaling was suppressed, resulting in the inhibition of CRC cell growth. Consistently, terbinafine, an SQLE inhibitor, suppressed CRC cell proliferation and organoid and xenograft tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that SQLE promotes CRC through the accumulation of calcitriol and stimulation of CYP24A1-mediated MAPK signaling, highlighting SQLE as a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Certain species of pathogenic bacteria damage tissues by secreting cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, which form pores in the plasma membranes of animal cells. However, reducing cholesterol protects cells against these cytolysins. As the first committed step of cholesterol biosynthesis is catalyzed by squalene synthase, we explored whether inhibiting this enzyme protected cells against cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. We first synthesized 22 different nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate molecules that were designed to inhibit squalene synthase. Squalene synthase inhibition was quantified using a cell-free enzyme assay, and validated by computer modeling of bisphosphonate molecules binding to squalene synthase. The bisphosphonates were then screened for their ability to protect HeLa cells against the damage caused by the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, pyolysin. The most effective bisphosphonate reduced pyolysin-induced leakage of lactate dehydrogenase into cell supernatants by >80%, and reduced pyolysin-induced cytolysis from >75% to <25%. In addition, this bisphosphonate reduced pyolysin-induced leakage of potassium from cells, limited changes in the cytoskeleton, prevented mitogen-activated protein kinases cell stress responses, and reduced cellular cholesterol. The bisphosphonate also protected cells against another cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, streptolysin O, and protected lung epithelial cells and primary dermal fibroblasts against cytolysis. Our findings imply that treatment with bisphosphonates that inhibit squalene synthase might help protect tissues against pathogenic bacteria that secrete cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.",

      "abstract": "Intracellular distribution of doxorubicin (DOX) and its squalenoylated (SQ-DOX) nanoparticles (NPs) form in murine lung carcinoma M109 and human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by Raman microspectroscopy. Pharmacological data showed that DOX induced higher cytotoxic effect than SQ-DOX NPs. Raman data were obtained using single-point measurements and imaging on the whole cell areas. These data showed that after DOX treatment at 1 μM, the spectral features of DOX were not detected in the M109 cell cytoplasm and nucleus. However, the intracellular distribution of SQ-DOX NPs was higher than DOX in the same conditions. In addition, SQ-DOX NPs were localized into both cell cytoplasm and nucleus. After 5 μM treatment, Raman bands of DOX at 1211 and 1241 cm-1 were detected in the nucleus. Moreover, the intensity ratio of these bands decreased, indicating DOX intercalation into DNA. However, after treatment with SQ-DOX NPs, the intensity of these Raman bands increased. Interestingly, with SQ-DOX NPs, the intensity of 1210/1241 cm-1 ratio was higher suggesting a lower fraction of intercalated DOX in DNA and higher amount of non-hydrolyzed SQ-DOX. Raman imaging data confirm this subcellular localization of these drugs in both M109 and MDA-MB-231 cells. These finding brings new insights to the cellular characterization of anticancer drugs at the molecular level, particularly in the field of nanomedicine.",

The quality of life in patients with tinea infection may be affected by different factors, including morbidity, length of illness, social and demographic factors. The present investigation explores the functional principle of a bioactive compound isolated from actinomycetes, S. albidoflavus STV1572a by in-silico and in-vitro studies. In continuation of our previous reports on the antidermatophytic potential of S. albidoflavus STV1572a, this study progresses with the in-silico molecular docking study of the seven GC-MS discovered ligands, and six dermatophytic modelled targets. Through virtual screening, it was revealed that a docking score -8.8 between 1-heneicosanol and squalene epoxidase favored partially in understanding the mode of action. Further validation of in-silico study was performed by a sterol quantification assay which confirmed the antidermatophytic mechanism of 1-heneicosanol. Taken together, the evidence from this study suggests that 1-heneicosanol has a potential antidermatophytic compound and can be considered for dermatophytic treatment.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have been recognized as the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for 31% of global mortality. Among the risk factors of CVD, hyperlipidemia has been established as the most potent risk factor. Statins, a class of drug that reduces lower-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), are the preferred medical treatment. However, due to the development of statin-associated muscle symptoms, statins are associated with patients' discontinuation and nonadherence. Other statin-induced side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal upset, all contribute to patients choosing alternative medicines. Squalene (SQ), an unsaturated hydrocarbon naturally synthesized in plants and animals, could become the alternative treatment or supplementary agent for cardiovascular health. SQ has been shown to exert cardioprotective effect via its antioxidant activity. Oxidative stress and inflammatory responses are closely related to each other, which proposes an interdependence relation between antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Therefore, this review explores the interdependence between the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of SQ implicated on cardiovascular health."

One hundred forty-four 1-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chicks were allocated to 3 groups, and each group consisted of 6 replicates of 8 birds each. The three groups were as follows: 1) nonchallenged broilers fed with a basal diet (control group), 2) diquat-challenged broilers fed a basal diet, and 3) diquat-challenged broilers fed with a basal diet supplemented with 1.0 g/kg of squalene. Broilers were intraperitoneally injected with 20 mg/mL of diquat solution at a dosage of 1 mL/kg of BW or an equivalent amount of saline at 20 d. Compared with the control group, weight gain and BW change rate during 24 h after injection were decreased by diquat challenge (P < 0.05), and the diquat-induced compromised growth performance was improved by squalene supplementation (P < 0.05). Diquat administration reduced plasma superoxide dismutase activity and increased malondialdehyde accumulation and glutathione peroxidase activity in both plasma and the liver (P < 0.05). In contrast, plasma glutathione peroxidase activity in diquat-challenged broilers was reduced by squalene supplementation (P < 0.05). The hepatic glutathione level was reduced by diquat administration (P < 0.05), whereas its level in plasma and the liver of diquat-challenged broilers was increased by squalene supplementation (P < 0.05). The relative liver weight of broilers was increased by diquat challenge (P < 0.05), with its value being intermediate in the squalene-supplemented group (P > 0.05). The plasma aminotransferase activities and total bilirubin concentration were increased by diquat challenge (P < 0.05), which were reduced by squalene supplementation (P < 0.05). The mRNA abundance of hepatic nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (P < 0.05) was upregulated by diquat treatment, regardless of squalene supplementation. The mRNA abundance of hepatic glutathione peroxidase 1 and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2-associated X protein was upregulated by diquat challenge (P < 0.05), which was reversed by squalene administration (P < 0.05). Squalene increased NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 mRNA abundance and decreased caspase 3 mRNA abundance in the liver of diquat-challenged broilers (P < 0.05). The results suggested that squalene can increase weight gain, improve oxidative status, and alleviate liver injury in diquat-challenged broilers.",

Better understanding of the ozone/squalene reaction and product transport characteristics is thus important. In this study, we developed a physical-chemical coupling model to describe the behavior of ozone/squalene reaction products, that is, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO) and 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA) in the gas phase and skin, by considering the chemical reaction and physical transport processes (external convection, internal diffusion, and surface uptake). Experiments without intervention were performed in a single-family house in California utilizing time- and space-resolved measurements. The key parameters in the model were extracted from 5 day data and then used to predict the behaviors in some other days. Predictions from the present model can reproduce the concentration profiles of the three compounds (ozone, 6-MHO, and 4-OPA) well (R2 = 0.82-0.89), indicating high accuracy of the model. Exposure analysis shows that the total amount of 6-MHO and 4-OPA entering the blood capillaries in 4 days can reach 14.6 and 30.1 μg, respectively. The contribution of different sinks to ozone removal in the tested realistic indoor environment was also analyzed.",

The allylamine class of antimycotics targets the enzyme squalene monooxygenase. This enzyme occupies a key position in the sterol biosynthesis pathway in eukaryotes, catalyzing the rate-limiting reaction by introducing an oxygen atom to the squalene substrate converting it to 2,3-oxidosqualene. Currently, terbinafine-the most widely used allylamine-is mostly used for treating superficial fungal infections. The ability to better target this enzyme will have significant implications for human health in the treatment of fungal infections. The human orthologue can also be targeted for cholesterol-lowering therapeutics and in cancer therapies. This review will focus on the structural basis for improving the current therapeutics for fungal squalene monooxygenase."

      "abstract": "In order to improve the membrane lipophilicity and the affinity towards the environment of lipid bilayers, squalene (SQ) could be conjugated to phospholipids in the formation of liposomes. The effect of membrane composition and concentrations on the degradation of liposomes prepared via the extrusion method was investigated. Liposomes were prepared using a mixture of SQ, cholesterol (CH) and Tween80 (TW80). Based on the optimal conditions, liposome batches were prepared in the absence and presence of SQ. Their physicochemical and stability behavior were evaluated as a function of liposome constituent. From the optimization study, the liposomal formulation containing 5% (w/w) mixed soy lecithin (ML), 0.5% (w/w) SQ, 0.3% (w/w) CH and 0.75% (w/w) TW80 had optimal physicochemical properties and displayed a unilamellar structure. Liposome prepared using the optimal formulation had a low particle size (158.31 ± 2.96 nm) and acceptable %increase in the particle size (15.09% ± 3.76%) and %trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (%TEAC) loss (35.69% ± 0.72%) against UV light treatment (280-320 nm) for 6 h. The interesting outcome of this research was the association of naturally occurring substance SQ for size reduction without the extra input of energy or mechanical procedures, and improvement of vesicle stability and antioxidant activity of ML-based liposome. This study also demonstrated that the presence of SQ in the membrane might increase the acyl chain dynamics and decrease the viscosity of the dispersion, thereby limiting long-term stability of the liposome.",

Although continuous imipramine monotherapy for 28 days (5 mg/kg) results in significant clearance of organ parasites in both SbR and SbSLD infected hamsters, the dose for the sterile parasite clearance from visceral organ is comparatively higher (10 mg/kg) and shows signs of toxicity. Hence, to reduce the toxicity, we encapsulated imipramine in squalene-phosphatidylcholine (SP) liposome (Lip-Imi) and tested its efficacy for a short-course treatment (10 days) in the animal model of visceral leishmaniasis. We observed a significant reduction of hepatic toxicity coupled with sterile parasite clearance in case of this short-course treatment of Lip-Imi, which is absent with free Imi treatment. This also correlates with significant increase in serum availability of imipramine in case of Lip-Imi treatment due to sustained release. Clearance of parasite was coupled with the polarization of antileishmanial immune repertoire from Th2 to Th1 after treatment with Lip-Imi in both SbRLD and SbSLD infected mouse models of LD infection. This study showed that imipramine is effective against both SbSLD and SbRLD at a significantly lower dose with reduced time course of treatment without any toxic side effects, when encapsulated in SP-liposome. Thus, the drug has the potential to be repurposed for the treatment of Kala-azar.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of hydrothermal processing on squalene, α-tocopherol, and fatty acids in the whole-grain, milled fractions, and their storage stability. RESULTS: The highest level of squalene content was found in the bran fractions of native and processed Job's tears (11.54-12.75 mg 100 g-1 ). A remarkably high amount of α-tocopherol was also found in the bran (59.75 ± 0.47 mg 100 g-1 ) and germ (67.05 ± 0.94 mg 100 g-1 ) of the processed grain fractions. The storage stability evaluation of these bioactive compounds in the polished grains revealed no significant difference between 0 and 15 days of storage under elevated temprature of 37 °C and 92% relative humidity (accelarated storage conidition) and retained the bioactive compounds longer in the processed grains. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the processed Job's tears milled fractions with high bioactive compounds and improved shelf life can be used as food ingredients in product development. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Gusperimus is a relatively safe immunosuppressive drug with low cytotoxicity and reversible side effects. It is highly hydrophilic and unstable. Therefore, it requires administration in high doses which increases its side effects. To overcome this, here we encapsulated gusperimus as squalene-gusperimus nanoparticles (Sq-GusNPs). These nanoparticles (NPs) were obtained from nanoassembly of the squalene gusperimus (Sq-Gus) bioconjugate in water, which was synthesized starting from squalene. The size, charge, and dispersity of the Sq-GusNPs were optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). The colloidal stability of the Sq-GusNPs was tested using an experimental block design at different storage temperatures after preparing them at different pH conditions. Sq-GusNPs showed to be colloidally stable, non-cytotoxic, readily taken up by cells, and with an anti-inflammatory effect sustained over time. We demonstrate that gusperimus was stabilized through its conjugation with squalene and subsequent formation of NPs allowing its controlled release. Overall, the Sq-GusNPs have the potential to be used as an alternative in approaches for the treatment of different pathologies where a controlled release of gusperimus could be required.",

      "abstract": "Cholesterol is the major component of lipid rafts. Squalene synthase (SQS) is a cholesterol biosynthase that functions in cholesterol biosynthesis, modulates the formation of lipids rafts and promotes lung cancer metastasis. In this study, we investigated the lipid raft-associated pathway of SQS in lung cancer. Gene expression microarray data revealed the upregulation of secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1; also known as osteopontin, OPN) in CL1-0/SQS-overexpressing cells. Knockdown of OPN in SQS-overexpressing cells inhibits their migration and invasion, whereas an OPN treatment rescues the migration and invasion of SQS knockdown cells. High OPN expression is associated with lymph node status, advanced stage and poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. Moreover, patients with high SQS expression and high OPN expression show poor survival compared with patients with low SQS expression and low OPN expression. SQS induces the phosphorylation of Src and ERK1/2 via OPN, resulting in increased expression of MMP1 and subsequent metastasis of lung cancer cells. Based on our findings, SQS expression increases the expression of OPN and phosphorylation of Src through cholesterol synthesis to modulate the formation of lipid rafts. SQS may represent a therapeutic strategy for lung cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dermatomycoses are the most common fungal infections in the world affecting a significant part of the human and animal population. The majority of zoophilic infections in humans are caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Currently, the first-line drug for both oral and topical therapy is terbinafine. However, an increasing number of cases that are difficult to be cured with this drug have been noted in Europe and Asia. Resistance to terbinafine and other allylamines is very rare and usually correlated with point mutations in the squalene epoxidase gene resulting in single amino acid substitutions in the enzyme, which is crucial in the ergosterol synthesis pathway. PURPOSE: Here, we report terbinafine-resistant T. mentagrophytes isolates among which one was an etiological factor of tinea capitis in a man and three were obtained from asymptomatic foxes in Poland. METHODS: We used the CLSI protocol to determine antifungal susceptibility profiles of naftifine, amphotericin B, griseofulvin, ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and ciclopirox. Moreover, the squalene epoxidase gene of the terbinafine-resistant strains was sequenced and analysed. RESULTS: In the genomes of all four resistant strains exhibiting elevated MICs to terbinafine (16 to 32 µg/ml), single-point mutations leading to Leu393Phe substitution in the squalene epoxidase enzyme were revealed. Among the other tested substances, a MIC50 value of 1 µg/ml was shown only for griseofulvin. CONCLUSION: Finally, our study revealed that the terbinafine resistance phenomenon might not be acquired by exposure to the drug but can be intrinsic. This is evidenced by the description of the terbinafine-resistant strains isolated from the asymptomatic animals.",

      "abstract": "Squalene (SQ) is a natural triterpene widely distributed in nature. It is a metabolic intermediate of the sterol biosynthetic pathway and represents a possible target in different metabolic and oxidative stress-related disorders. Growing interest has been focused on SQ's antioxidant properties, derived from its chemical structure. Strong evidence provided by ex vivo models underline its scavenging activity towards free radicals, whereas only a few studies have highlighted its effect in cellular models of oxidative stress. Given the role of unbalanced free radicals in both the onset and progression of several cardiovascular diseases, an in depth evaluation of SQ's contribution to antioxidant defense mechanisms could represent a strategic approach in dealing with these pathological conditions. At present experimental results overall show a double-edged sword role of squalene in cardiovascular diseases and its function has to be better elucidated in order to establish intervention lines focused on its features. This review aims to summarize current knowledge about endogenous and exogenous sources of SQ and to point out the controversial role of SQ in cardiovascular physiology."

      "abstract": "Uncontrolled inflammatory processes are at the root of numerous pathologies. Most recently, studies on confirmed COVID-19 cases have suggested that mortality might be due to virally induced hyperinflammation. Uncontrolled pro-inflammatory states are often driven by continuous positive feedback loops between pro-inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress, which cannot be resolved in a targeted manner. Here, we report on the development of multidrug nanoparticles for the mitigation of uncontrolled inflammation. The nanoparticles are made by conjugating squalene, a natural lipid, to adenosine, an endogenous immunomodulator, and then encapsulating α-tocopherol, as antioxidant. This resulted in high drug loading, biocompatible, multidrug nanoparticles. By exploiting the endothelial dysfunction at sites of acute inflammation, these multidrug nanoparticles delivered the therapeutic agents in a targeted manner, conferring survival advantage to treated animals in models of endotoxemia. Selectively delivering adenosine and antioxidants together could serve as a novel therapeutic approach for safe treatment of acute paradoxal inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a particularly aggressive subset of lung cancer, and identification of new therapeutic options is of significant interest. We recently reported that SCLC cell lines display a specific vulnerability to inhibition of squalene epoxidase (SQLE), an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway that catalyzes the conversion of squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene. Since it has been reported that SQLE inhibition can result in dermatitis in dogs, we conducted a series of experiments to determine if SQLE inhibitors would be tolerated at exposures predicted to drive maximal efficacy in SCLC tumors. Detailed profiling of the SQLE inhibitor NB-598 showed that dogs did not tolerate predicted efficacious exposures, with dose-limiting toxicity due to gastrointestinal clinical observations, although skin toxicities were also observed. To extend these studies, two SQLE inhibitors, NB-598 and Cmpd-4″, and their structurally inactive analogs, NB-598.ia and Cmpd-4″.ia, were profiled in monkeys. While both active SQLE inhibitors resulted in dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicity, the structurally similar inactive analogs did not. Collectively, our data demonstrate that significant toxicities arise at exposures well below the predicted levels needed for anti-tumor activity. The on-target nature of the toxicities identified is likely to limit the potential therapeutic utility of SQLE inhibition for the treatment of SCLC.",

      "abstract": "Full-thickness burns pose a major challenge for clinicians to handle because of their restricted self-healing ability. Even though several approaches have been implemented for repairing these burnt skin tissue defects, all of them had unsatisfactory outcomes. Moreover, during recent years, skin tissue engineering techniques have emerged as a promising approach to improve skin tissue regeneration and overcome the shortcomings of the traditional approaches. Although previous literatures report the wound healing effects of the squalene oil, in the current study, for the first time, we developed a squalene-loaded emulgel-based scaffold as a novel approach for potential skin regeneration. This squalene-loaded agar-based emulgel scaffold was fabricated by using physical cross-linking technique using lecithin as an emulsifier. Characterization studies such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed the amorphous nature, chemical interactions, and cross-linked capabilities of the developed emulgel scaffold. The squalene-loaded emulgel scaffold showed excellent wound contraction when compared with the agar gel and negative control. In case of the histopathology and recent immunohistochemistry findings, it was clearly evidenced that squalene-loaded emulgel promoted faster rate of the revascularization and macrophage polarization in order to enhance the burn wound healing. Moreover, the findings also revealed that the incorporation of squalene oil into the formulation enhances collagen deposition and accelerates the burnt skin tissue regeneration process. Finally, we conclude that the squalene-loaded emulgel scaffold could be an effective formulation used in the treatment of the burnt skin tissue defects.",

We studied the antifungal susceptibility profiles in Iranian isolates of these two species. METHODS: A total of 96 T. interdigitale and 45 T. mentagrophytes isolates were subjected to molecular typing by ribosomal ITS region. Antifungal susceptibility profiles for terbinafine, griseofulvin, clotrimazole, efinaconazole, luliconazole, amorolfine and ciclopirox were obtained by CLSI broth microdilution method. The squalene epoxidase (SQLE) gene was subjected to sequencing for mutations, if any, in isolates exhibiting elevated MICs for terbinafine. RESULTS: Luliconazole and efinaconazole showed the lowest MIC values against T. mentagrophytes and T. interdigitale isolates. There were five isolates with terbinafine MICs ≥32 µg/mL in our sample. They belonged to T. mentagrophytes type VIII and harbored two alternative SQLE gene sequence variants, leading to Phe397Leu and Ala448Thr or Leu393Ser and Ala448Thr substitutions in the enzyme. All terbinafine resistant strains could be inhibited by luliconazole and efinaconazole. CONCLUSION: This study documented a step in the global spread of resistance mechanisms in T. mentagrophytes. However, treatment alternatives for resistant isolates were available."

      "abstract": "Cholesterol biosynthesis is a high-cost process and, therefore, tightly regulated by both transcriptional and posttranslational negative feedback mechanisms in response to the level of cellular cholesterol. Squalene monooxygenase (SM, also known as squalene epoxidase or SQLE) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and catalyzes epoxidation of squalene. The stability of SM is negatively regulated by cholesterol via its N-terminal regulatory domain (SM-N100). In this study, using a SM-luciferase fusion reporter cell line, we performed a chemical genetics screen that identified inhibitors of SM itself as up-regulators of SM. This effect was mediated through the SM-N100 region, competed with cholesterol-accelerated degradation, and required the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH6. However, up-regulation was not observed with statins, well-established cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors, and this pointed to the presence of another mechanism other than reduced cholesterol synthesis. Further analyses revealed that squalene accumulation upon treatment with the SM inhibitor was responsible for the up-regulatory effect. Using photoaffinity labeling, we demonstrated that squalene directly bound to the N100 region, thereby reducing interaction with and ubiquitination by MARCH6. Our findings suggest that SM senses squalene via its N100 domain to increase its metabolic capacity, highlighting squalene as a feedforward factor for the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.",

The natural distribution of protostane triterpenes is limited mainly to members of the botanical family Alismataceae. Squalene epoxidase (SE) is the key rate-limiting enzyme in triterpene biosynthesis. In this study, we report the characterization of two SEs from A. orientale. AoSE1 and AoSE2 were expressed as fusion proteins in E. coli, and the purified proteins were used in functional research. In vitro enzyme assays showed that AoSE1 and AoSE2 catalyze the formation of oxidosqualene from squalene. Immunoassays revealed that the tubers contain the highest levels of AoSE1 and AoSE2. After MeJA induction, which is the main elicitor of triterpene biosynthesis, the contents of 2,3-oxidosqualene and alisol B 23-acetate increased by 1.96- and 2.53-fold, respectively. In addition, the expression of both AoSE proteins was significantly increased at four days after MeJA treatment. The contents of 2,3-oxidosqualene and alisol B 23-acetate were also positively correlated with AoSEs expression at different times after MeJA treatment. These results suggest that AoSE1 and AoSE2 are the key regulatory points in protostane triterpenes biosynthesis, and that MeJA regulates the biosynthesis of these compounds by increasing the expression of AoSE1 and AoSE2.",

These natural terpenoid products of triterpene aglycones are catalyzed by squalene synthase (SQS), a highly conserved enzyme present in eukaryotes. However, there is scare information on alfalfa SQS. Here, an open reading frame (ORF) of SQS was cloned from alfalfa. Sequence analysis showed MsSQS had the same exon/intron composition and shared high homology with its orthologs. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the deduced MsSQS had two transmembrane domains. When transiently expressed, GFP-MsSQS fusion protein was localized on the plasma membrane of onion epidermal cells. Removal of the C-terminal transmembrane domain of MsSQS improved solubility in Escherichia coli. MsSQS was preferably expressed in roots, followed by leaves and stems. MeJA treatment induced MsSQS expression and increased the content of total saponins. Overexpression of MsSQS in alfalfa led to the accumulation of total saponins, suggesting a correlation between MsSQS expression level with saponins content. Therefore, MsSQS is a canonical squalene synthase and contributes to saponin synthesis in alfalfa. This study provides a key candidate gene for genetic manipulation of the synthesis of triterpene saponins, which impact both plant and animal health.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, cases involving terbinafine-resistant Trichophyton isolates have been reported increasingly, particularly in India. We present 14 cases of terbinafine treatment failure in Trichophyton-infected Danish patients due to acquired resistance. Patients infected with Trichophyton rubrum (n = 12) or Trichophyton interdigitale (n = 2) with elevated terbinafine MICs during 2013-2018 were included. Antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) was performed following a modified EUCAST E.Def 9.3.1 method (5 days of incubation) with or without cycloheximide and chloramphenicol (CC) supplementation of the growth medium. The squalene epoxidase (SE) target gene was sequenced, and 3-dimensional enzyme homology modeling was performed. Most patients (12/14 [86%]) were male. The mean age was 53.5 years (range, 11 to 77 years). The mean duration of infections was 4.8 years at the time of resistance detection. Prior systemic terbinafine treatment was documented for all patients, and topical therapy for 62% (information was missing in one case). Overall, nine isolates (64%) displayed high terbinafine resistance (MICs, 4 to >8 mg/liter), while two (14%) displayed moderate (MICs, 1 to 2 mg/liter) and three (21%) displayed low (MICs, 0.125 to 0.25 mg/liter) terbinafine resistance compared with control isolates. MICs generated with or without CC supplementation were similar, but CC prevented contamination. Known and novel SE amino acid substitutions (F397L, L393F, L393S, F415S, H440Y F484Y, and I121M V237I) were detected in resistant but not control isolates. Three-dimensional homology modeling suggested a role of the novel I121M and V237I alterations. Terbinafine resistance has been detected in Denmark using a modified EUCAST method, which facilitated susceptibility testing of dermatophytes. Action is needed for this emerging public health problem.",

      "abstract": "The clinical use of cisplatin, which is a first-line anticancer agent, is highly restricted due to its adverse effects on kidneys that lead to nephrotoxicity. Therefore, some potential reno-protective substances have been used in combination with cisplatin to cope with nephrotoxicity. Due to its high antitumor activity and oxygen-carrying capacity, we investigated the molecular effects of squalene against cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and kidney damage in mice. Single dose of cisplatin (7 mg/kg) was given to male Balb/c mice. Squalene (100 mg/kg/day) was administered orogastrically to mice for 10 days. Following sacrification, molecular alterations were investigated as analysis of the levels of oxidative stress index (OSI), inflammatory cytokines and cell survival-related proteins in addition to histopathological examinations in mice kidney tissue. The level OSI and Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) decreased in the cisplatin and squalene cotreated mice compared to cisplatin-treated mice. Squalene treatment also increased the activation of protein kinase B (AKT). Furthermore, cisplatin-induced inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and histopathological damages were reversed by squalene. It may be suggested that squalene ameliorated the cisplatin-induced histopathological damages in the kidney through activation of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by regulating the balance of the redox system due to its antioxidative effect."

      "abstract": "Although algae have been the focal point of biofuel research, studies on their biological activities have been limited. In recent years, however, the importance of algae as sources of functional ingredients has been recognized due to their health beneficial effects. In this study, we evaluated the antidepressant-like activities of ethanol extract of Aurantiochytrium sp. (EEA) in the forced swimming test (FST)-induced depression in ICR mice. Imipramine, a commercially available tricyclic antidepressant drug, was used as positive control. Animals were administered EEA orally for 14 consecutive days and were subjected to the locomotor activity testing. Additionally, changes in gene expression in mice brain were assessed by real-time PCR and microarray assays to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of EEA. We found that the immobility time in FST was significantly reduced in the EEA-treated mice compared to that of in the control mice. Microarray and real-time PCR results revealed that EEA treatment induced changes in several genes in mice brain associated with pro-inflammation and dopaminergic, cholinergic, glutamatergic, and serotonergic synapses. It has previously been reported that several cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, which mediate neuroinflammation, are also responsible for indirectly altering brain neurotransmitter levels in neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, the regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in EEA-administered mice brain is considered to contribute to the enhancement of neurotransmitter systems-related gene expression in our study. Moreover, our in vitro study suggested that squalene, a component produced by Aurantiochytrium, was one of the active substances in EEA. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that Aurantiochytrium sp. can reduce neuroinflammation that may contribute to the modulation of the neurotransmitter systems, which could underlie its antistress and antidepressant effects.",

In the present study, the feasibility of chitosan-whey protein as an efficient wall material for squalene encapsulation using spray drying technique was attempted for functional food applications. The encapsulation efficiency of the squalene powder was found to be 75.4 ± 0.22% whereas other physico-chemical properties such as moisture content, flowability, solubility, peroxide value, etc. have shown satisfactory results. The thermogravimetric analysis showed that chitosan-whey protein was able to retain the thermal stability of squalene up to a temperature of 422 °C. Furthermore, the functional food application of the encapsulated squalene in a bakery product (cake) exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) better properties in terms of oxidative stability, sensory attributes than that of cake with pure squalene and control treatment. Hence, it can be concluded that emulsification of squalene in chitosan-whey protein and its subsequent encapsulation by spray drying can be a potential process to produce oxidatively stable encapsulates for the development of functional foods.",

To clarify the cytotoxic mechanism of MA1, we screened for the genes involved in the cytotoxicity of MA1 in monocytoid U937 cells by using a CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide knockout library. Screening was performed by positive selection for cells that were resistant to MA1 treatment, and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) integrated into MA1-resistant cells were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. As a result of the evaluation of sgRNAs that were enriched in MA1-resistant cells, SQLE, which encodes squalene epoxidase, was identified as a candidate gene. SQLE-depleted U937 cells were viable in the presence of MA1, and squalene epoxidase inhibitor conferred MA1 resistance to wild-type cells. These results indicate that squalene epoxidase is implicated in the cytotoxicity of MA1. This finding represents a new insight into applications of MA1 for treating ischemic diseases.",

The expression of SQLE in lung cancer is abnormal. We conducted this study to investigate the effect of SQLE expression on lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) proliferation, migration, and invasion and its role in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. METHODS: Cell Counting Kit 8, wound healing, and Transwell assays; Western blotting; and quantitative real-time PCR were used to investigate the effect of SQLE in a lung SCC H520 cell line. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to identify the prognostic significance of SQLE. RESULTS: Overexpression of SQLE promoted lung SCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of SQLE expression showed the opposite effect. SQLE can interact with ERK to enhance its phosphorylation. SQLE may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung cancer by modulating ERK signaling. Further survival analysis indicated that high expression of SQLE indicated poor prognosis in lung SCC. CONCLUSION: Our study presents novel evidence of potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for lung SCC therapy and prognosis.",

His discovery of biodegradable poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) (PACA) nanoparticles (NPs) has opened large perspectives in nanomedicine. Indeed, NPs made from various types of alkyl cyanoacrylate monomers have been used in different applications, such as the treatment of intracellular infections or the treatment of multidrug resistant hepatocarcinoma. This latest application led to the Phase III clinical trial of Livatag®, a PACA nanoparticulate formulation of doxorubicin. Despite the success of PACA NPs, the development of a novel type of NP with higher drug loadings and lower burst release was tackled by the discovery of squalene-based nanomedicines where the drug is covalently linked to the lipid derivative and the resulting conjugate is self-assembled into NPs. This pioneering work was accompanied by a wide range of novel applications which mainly dealt with the management of unmet medical needs (e.g. pancreatic cancer, brain ischaemia and spinal cord injury).",

SQLE inhibition is targeted for the treatment of hypercholesteremia, cancer, and fungal infections. However, lack of structure-function understanding has hindered further progression of its inhibitors. We have determined the first three-dimensional high-resolution crystal structures of human SQLE catalytic domain with small molecule inhibitors (2.3 Å and 2.5 Å). Comparison with its unliganded state (3.0 Å) reveals conformational rearrangements upon inhibitor binding, thus allowing deeper interpretation of known structure-activity relationships. We use the human SQLE structure to further understand the specificity of terbinafine, an approved agent targeting fungal SQLE, and to provide the structural insights into terbinafine-resistant mutants encountered in the clinic. Collectively, these findings elucidate the structural basis for the specificity of the epoxidation reaction catalyzed by SQLE and enable further rational development of next-generation inhibitors.",

The current study aims to use reconstructed human skin equivalents to demonstrate topical stressor-induced hyperpigmentation and evaluate bioactives' potential protective effect. Given that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are representative airborne particle-bound organic compounds with known relevance to pigmentation pathways, benzo(a)pyrene was selected as surrogate environmental toxin. On the other hand, squalene monohydroperoxides are well-characterized sebum peroxidation product under UV and pollutant exposure, thus are used as another representative skin stressor. With 3-day continuous exposure, 30 pmol/cm2 of benzo(a)pyrene and 3.4 nmol/cm2 of squalene monohydroperoxides induced significant viability loss, inflammatory response, and approximately 10 shades of pigmentation increase in pigmented living skin equivalents. At the same time, pretreatment and co-treatment with 12-hydroxystearic acid (12-HSA, 20 μmol/L) or niacinamide (5 mmol/L) ameliorated such stressor-induced consequences. Niacinamide was particularly effective against benzo(a)pyrene damage, probably as a substrate for important NAD+ dependent detoxification pathways, while 12-HSA was potent against squalene monohydroperoxides through barrier enhancing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative mechanisms. In summary, topical stressor-induced hyperpigmentation was achieved in vitro, with known bioactives showing protective benefits.",

      "abstract": "Recalcitrant dermatophytoses are on the rise in India. High MICs of terbinafine (TRB) and squalene epoxidase (SQLE) gene mutations conferring resistance in Trichophyton spp. have been recently documented. However, studies correlating laboratory data with clinical response to TRB in tinea corporis/cruris are lacking. For this study, we investigated the clinicomycological profile of 85 tinea corporis/cruris patients and performed antifungal susceptibility testing by CLSI microbroth dilution and SQLE mutation analysis of the isolates obtained and correlated these with the responses to TRB. Patients confirmed by potassium hydroxide (KOH) mounting of skin scrapings were started on TRB at 250 mg once a day (OD). If >50% clinical clearance was achieved by 3 weeks, the same dose was continued (group 1). If response was <50%, the dose was increased to 250 mg twice a day (BD) (group 2). If the response still remained below 50% after 3 weeks of BD, the patients were treated with itraconazole (ITR; group 3). Overall, skin scrapings from 64 (75.3%) patients yielded growth on culture. Strikingly, all isolates were confirmed to be Trichophyton interdigitale isolates by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing. Thirty-nine (61%) of the isolates had TRB MICs of ≥1 µg/ml. Complete follow-up data were available for 30 culture-positive patients. A highly significant difference in modal MICs to TRB among the three treatment response groups was noted (P = 0.009). Interestingly, 8 of the 9 patients in group 3 harbored isolates exhibiting elevated TRB MICs (8 to 32 µg/ml) and SQLE mutations. The odds of achieving cure with TRB MIC < 1 µg/ml strains were 2.5 times the odds of achieving cure with the strain exhibiting MIC ≥1 µg/ml.",

      "abstract": "Oestrus urine was proved as a potential endocrine modulator in alleviating the toxicity induced by 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) in male rats. We, in this study, aimed to prove the attributing potential of toxicity alleviation to squalene, an oestrus-specific pheromone in rats. A single dose of 3-methylcholanthrene (25 mg/kg BW, i.p.) was administered to male Wistar rats with concurrent exposure to squalene sprayed in bedding material (Group III). Group II rats did receive 3-MC treatment but did not expose to squalene. Group I rats were intact control neither administered 3-MC nor sprayed with squalene. In consequence of 3-MC toxicity, liver and testes weights were increased and the components of blood cells (RBC and WBC count, Hb level) and testosterone concentration were significantly reduced in Group II rats. Moreover, sperm count was reduced and antioxidants (testes and epididymis) were significantly altered. Exposure to squalene in Group III rats comparatively normalised all the variable components towards baseline and reorganised the histological architecture of reproductive tissues that were exacerbated with 3-MC toxicity. This study ultimately proved squalene as a potent molecule in alleviating the toxicity induced by 3-methylcholanthrene.",

      "abstract": "Squalene synthase (SQS), a key downstream enzyme involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, plays an important role in treating hyperlipidemia. Compared to statins, SQS inhibitors have shown a very significant lipid-lowering effect and do not cause myotoxicity. Thus, the paper aims to discover potential SQS inhibitors from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) by the combination of molecular modeling methods and biological assays. In this study, cynarin was selected as a potential SQS inhibitor candidate compound based on its pharmacophoric properties, molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Cynarin could form hydrophobic interactions with PHE54, LEU211, LEU183 and PRO292, which are regarded as important interactions for the SQS inhibitors. In addition, the lipid-lowering effect of cynarin was tested in sodium oleate-induced HepG2 cells by decreasing the lipidemic parameter triglyceride (TG) level by 22.50%. Finally. cynarin was reversely screened against other anti-hyperlipidemia targets which existed in HepG2 cells and cynarin was unable to map with the pharmacophore of these targets, which indicated that the lipid-lowering effects of cynarin might be due to the inhibition of SQS. This study discovered cynarin is a potential SQS inhibitor from TCM, which could be further clinically explored for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.",
