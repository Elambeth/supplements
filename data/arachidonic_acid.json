      "abstract": "Although splenic CD45-Ter119+ cells promote cancer progression by secreting artemin, it remains unclear whether these cells play an important role in myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Here, using a KrasG12D/+-induced mouse model of MPN, we demonstrated that the number and cycling of CD45-Ter119+ cells increased in the spleens of MPN mice. Moreover, these cells could differentiate into myeloid cells upon stimulation with GM-CSF and mIL-6. Through RNA sequencing, we further revealed that myeloid genes, such as Hoxa9, Mpo and Ms4a3, were highly expressed in CD45-Ter119+ cells. Mechanistically, we showed that the arachidonic acid content was significantly elevated in splenic CD45-Ter119+ cells, and exogenous arachidonic acid mediated the differentiation of splenic CD45-Ter119+ cells into myeloid cells. Our results revealed that splenic CD45-Ter119+ cells play a crucial role in myeloid leukemia and that arachidonic acid could be a potential therapeutic target for MPN treatment."

      "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis, a prevalent opportunistic pathogen, readily forms biofilms on surfaces, contributing to its virulence and antibiotic resistance. Previous studies have highlighted arachidonic acid (AA) as a promising antibiofilm agent. This investigation aimed to elucidate the antibiofilm activity of AA against linezolid-resistant E. faecalis and explore its potential molecular mechanisms. A total of 21 E. faecalis strains were included in this study: the standard strain ATCC 29212 and 20 linezolid-resistant clinical isolates. To determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics and AA, the microbroth dilution method was performed. Checkerboard microdilution assays were also performed to assess the interaction between AA and linezolid. The crystal violet method was performed to evaluate the biofilm formation abilities of E. faecalis and the biofilm inhibition activities of different concentrations of AA (0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, and 1 mM). In addition, the expression levels of biofilm-related genes (ebpA, ebpB, ebpC, gelE, ace, atlA, and esp) were measured employing quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). All clinical strains exhibited resistance to linezolid and tetracycline while remaining susceptible to other antibiotics, including penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and tigecycline. The MICs of AA against all 21 E. faecalis isolates were >1 mM. Synergy was observed in 75 % of strains (15/20), while additivity was observed in 25 % strains (5/20). All isolates displayed strong biofilm-forming abilities. AA significantly reduced biofilm formation with average inhibition rates of 68.16 %, 69.64 %, and 72.01 % at concentrations of 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, and 1 mM, respectively (P < 0.001). AA treatment resulted in decreased expression of ebpB, ebpC, ace, and atlA (P < 0.001), while simultaneously increasing gelE expression (P < 0.05). In conclusion, AA exhibited potent inhibitory effects on E. faecalis biofilm formation probably by influencing bacterial adhesion. The addition of AA can restore the susceptibility of linezolid against E. faecalis. These findings suggest that AA may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for preventing and treating E. faecalis infections, particularly those associated with biofilm formation."

      "abstract": "Dormant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells in the bone microenvironment can re-emerge as metastatic disease through osteoclast interactions. Using a 3D dormancy model and a mouse bone metastasis model, this study reveals that arachidonic acid (AA) is the initiating molecule transferred from osteoclasts to dormant LUAD cells, triggering their activation. Dormant LUAD cells uptake AA through CD36, which activates the PPARγ-ANGPTL4 pathway and activates tumor cells. There is a dose-response relationship in the activation effect of AA, and inhibiting AA metabolism prevents this reactivation. The study also finds that the serum levels of AA and ANGPTL4 are significantly elevated in patients with clinical bone metastases compared to those without. This research confirms that osteoclasts transmit AA via the CD36-PPARγ-ANGPTL4 axis to activate dormant LUAD cells, suggesting that AA and ANGPTL4 may serve as valuable biomarkers and potential clinical applications in treatment and prediction of LUAD bone metastasis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As an approved targeting drug, crizotinib has been widely used in the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements or c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) fusions and has demonstrated remarkable therapeutic effects. However, crizotinib-treated patients frequently experience drug resistance, and there are still some underlying mechanisms, which remain unclear. Autophagy, a cellular process that involves the degradation and recycling of cellular components, has been implicated in the development of drug resistance. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms of crizotinib resistance involving autophagy dysregulation and identify novel therapeutic targets to overcome this resistance. METHODS: We first established a model for crizotinib resistance in HCC78 and H3122 cells. Next, the level of proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy flux, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) of these cells were measured. Subsequently, we analyzed the published single-cell RNA sequencing data from three ALK-rearranged lung cancer organoid samples and performed a metabolomics assay on crizotinib-resistant HCC78 cells. Finally, the therapeutic effects were confirmed in vitro by targeting autophagy flux. RESULTS: Crizotinib induced cell apoptosis and growth arrest by promoting the accumulation of autophagosomes through the inhibition of autophagy flux in ROS1 + or ALK + NSCLC. In contrast, crizotinib-resistant NSCLC cells showed inactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and downregulation of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), leading to an increase in the metabolite arachidonic acid (AA). AA further promoted autophagy flux and reduced autophagosome accumulation, driving crizotinib resistance under conditions of drug stress. Moreover, chloroquine (CQ), anti-malaria drug and lysosome inhibitor developed in 1940, could induce cell death in crizotinib-resistant NSCLC by blocking AA-mediated autophagy flux and facilitating autophagosome accumulation, significantly enhancing the treatment efficacy of crizotinib in drug-resistant NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a new mechanism of first generation ALK- and ROS1-TKIs resistance, which points to the role of the metabolite AA in resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It may potentially provide an alternative strategy to overcoming crizotinib resistance in NSCLC treatment by reversing AA-mediated autophagy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Simiao Pill (SMP) has been demonstrated to suppress inflammation and modulate immune function, thereby influencing the onset and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Nonetheless, the specific molecular mechanisms and targets through which SMP mediates metabolic regulation and enhances immune function have yet to be fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we employed an integrated approach combining the analysis of dysregulated metabolites and proteins to identify, screen, and validate the metabolic regulatory targets of SMP in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats by using pseudotargeted metabolomics and 4D-DIA quantitative proteomics methodologies. METHODS: An AIA rat model was developed, and SMP was administered to AIA rats. Subsequently, assessments were conducted on paw edema, arthritis scores, histopathological changes and IL-1 β content of inflammatory factors in AIA rats. UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS was employed to analyze endogenous metabolites in the serum. Metabolic pathway and protein profile were performed on the biomarkers. The protein-lipidphenotype map for the SMP-treated rats was constructed and the primary target closely related to the metabolic regulation of SMP was further screened and verified. RESULTS: Pseudotargeted metabolomics analysis revealed that SMP can mitigate the down-regulation of lipid levels in AIA rats. Pathway enrichment analysis identified arachidonic acid metabolism as the most significantly affected metabolic pathway and SMP was found to substantially ameliorate the dysregulation of this pathway in AIA rats. Subsequent protein profiling led to the identification of five key proteins, with noteworthy obvious corrective effects observed on Ptges3 and Alox15 due to SMP treatment. A comprehensive protein- lipid-phenotypic landscape of SMP-treated rats was analyzed for the specific molecular expressions associated with the arachidonic acid pathway. According to the correlation matrix of dysregulated metabolite/ protein, we found that Ptges3 was ranked as the primary target closely related to the metabolic regulation of SMP, a finding further validated through immunofluorescence staining in rat joint and synovial cells. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that SMP exerts an anti-arthritic effect by modulating the arachidonic acid metabolic network via the Ptges3 protein in rat joints and human rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts. This finding offers a novel mechanistic insight into the pharmacological action of SMP in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats. It informs future research on the therapeutic potential of SMP in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."

      "abstract": "The combination of immune checkpoint blockade and chemotherapies is the standard of care for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, initially, responsive tumors can still develop recurrences, suggesting acquired resistance mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Herein, we discover that TNBC cells surviving anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) and chemotherapy treatment accumulate neutral lipids. Disrupting lipid droplet formation in cancer cells reverses resistance and mitigates the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a subset of neutrophils exhibiting a lipid-laden phenotype similar to adjacent tumor cells. Mechanistically, tumor-derived extracellular vesicles carrying lipids, including arachidonic acid (AA), mediate neutrophil reprogramming. Blocking dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids or inhibiting fatty acid elongation for AA synthesis restores anti-tumor immunity and re-sensitizes the resistant tumors to anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy treatment. In human patients, AA metabolism-related pathways correlates with neutrophil enrichment. Overall, we demonstrate how lipid accumulation in TNBC cells leads to immune suppression and therapy resistance.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of new treatment strategies. Arachidonic acid (ARA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, shows promise in cancer therapy due to its potential anti-tumor effects, although its role in lung cancer remains unclear. This study investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of ARA on A549 and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells. In vitro assays were used to assess cell viability, apoptosis, colony formation, lipid droplet formation, and changes in cellular lipid content. ARA dose-dependently suppressed cell viability, facilitated apoptosis, and suppressed colony formation in both lung cancer cell lines. Network pharmacology analysis was performed to identify potential gene targets and pathways, uncovering 61 overlapping genes between ARA and lung cancer-related targets, with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) emerging as a key gene. Enrichment analyses suggested that the effects of ARA might be mediated through lipid metabolism and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling pathway. In both lung cancer cell lines, ARA treatment inhibited lipid droplet formation and decreased the cellular lipids. Immunoblotting further confirmed that ARA treatment significantly increased ERK phosphorylation while reducing PPARγ and fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein levels. In vitro experiments using GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, confirmed that inhibiting lipid droplet formation impairs lung cancer cell viability and promotes apoptosis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrated that ARA significantly reduced tumor size and weight in a lung cancer xenograft model, further validating its anti-tumor effects. The potential of ARA as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer might involve lipid metabolism and relevant signaling pathways. A future study exploring the full therapeutic potential of ARA and underlying mechanisms in lung cancer is needed.",

While previous studies have demonstrated altered levels of arachidonic acid and its metabolites in psoriatic lesions, the specific roles of arachidonic acid metabolism (AAM) genes in the molecular pathogenesis and immune dysregulation of psoriasis remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of AAM genes in the pathogenesis and immune dysregulation of psoriasis using an integrative bioinformatics approach. METHODS: Gene expression data from psoriasis patients and healthy controls were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and analyzed. Differentially expressed genes were identified, and functional enrichment analyses were performed. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning techniques were employed to identify psoriasis associated AAM genes. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and immune cell composition analysis were conducted to explore functional implications. Transcription factor prediction analysis was performed to identify potential regulators of key AAM genes. RESULTS: Differential expression analysis revealed 469 dysregulated genes in psoriasis, with functional enrichment highlighting the involvement of epidermis development, immune response, and inflammation. WGCNA and machine learning approaches identified ABCC1, PLA2G3, CYP2J2, and GPX2 as key AAM genes. ssGSEA showed elevated inflammation and immune response in psoriasis, with key AAM genes correlating with specific pathways. Immune cell composition analysis revealed increased infiltration of inflammatory cells in psoriatic skin. Transcription factor prediction analysis identified shared transcription factors for the key AAM genes, suggesting coordinated regulation of their expression in psoriasis. CONCLUSION: This integrative analysis identified key AAM genes associated with psoriasis pathogenesis and immune dysregulation, providing novel insights into the molecular basis of psoriasis. The findings highlight potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers, which could lead to improved diagnosis and treatment strategies for this chronic inflammatory skin disorder."

It is associated with the inactivation of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and the accumulation of lipid peroxides within cells. Ferroptosis is closely related to the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chlorogenic acid (CGA), an important bioactive component found in 61 traditional Chinese medicines such as Eucommia ulmoides, has been extensively studied for its effects on various malignant tumors. However, the specific role and potential mechanism of CGA in HCC remain unclear. AIM: To elucidate the anti-tumor characteristics and potential mechanisms of CGA in inducing ferroptosis in HCC cells. METHODS: The effects of CGA on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells were evaluated through in vitro experiments. Bioinformatics analysis combined with network pharmacology was used to study the potential targets and molecular mechanisms of CGA intervention in HCC ferroptosis. In vitro experiments were conducted to verify and explore the anti-HCC effects and mechanisms of CGA through the ferroptosis pathway. RESULTS: In vitro experiments showed that CGA dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of HCC cells. Bioinformatics analysis combined with network pharmacology revealed that the pathway of CGA intervention in HCC cell ferroptosis was mainly enriched in the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2)/aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3)/GPX4 signaling pathway, which was associated with arachidonic acid. In vitro experiments further confirmed that CGA-induced ferroptosis in HCC cells was related to mitochondrial damage through the reprogramming of arachidonic acid metabolism by regulating the PTGS2/AKR1C3/GPX4 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that CGA inhibits HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inducing ferroptosis through the PTGS2/AKR1C3/GPX4 axis, suggesting its potential as a novel ferroptosis inducer or anti-HCC drug."

Machine-learning algorithms were used to identify six key genes as PTGDS, PNPLA8, FAAH, ABHD12, PTGS1, and MGLL. In both the training and validation sets, PTGDS, PNPLA8, and MGLL. In both the training and validation sets, PTGDS, PNPLA8, and MGLL were regarded as biomarkers. A nomogram based on these biomarkers showed potential for predicting the risk of vitiligo.

Previous research indicates that genes abnormally expressed in osteosarcoma are significantly involved in the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway. However, the role of arachidonic acid metabolism-related genes (AAMRGs) in osteosarcoma prognosis remains unknown. METHODS: Osteosarcoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were classified into high-score and low-score groups based on AAMRGs scores obtained through ssGSEA analysis. The intersecting genes were identified from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), DEGs (osteosarcoma vs. normal) and DE-AAMRGs (high- vs. low-score). An AA metabolism predictive model of the five AAMRGs were established by Cox regression and the LASSO algorithm. Model performance was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. In vitro experiments of the AA related biomarkers was validated. RESULTS: Our study constructed an AAMRGs prognostic signature (CD36, CLDN11, STOM, EPYC, PANX3). K-M analysis indicated that patients in the low-risk group showed superior overall survival to high-risk group (p<0.05). ROC curves showed that all AUC values in the prognostic model exceeded 0.76. By ESTIMATE algorithms, we discovered that patients in high-risk groups had lower immune score, stromal score, and estimate score. Correlation analysis showed the strongest positive correlation between STOM and natural killer cells, and the highest negative association between PANX3 and central memory CD8 T cells. An AAMRGs prognostic signature was constructed for osteosarcoma prognosis. CONCLUSION: The study suggested that a high level of AAMRGs might serve as a biomarker for poor prognosis in osteosarcoma and offers a potential explanation for the role of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in cancer. The five biomarkers (CD36, CLDN11, EPYC, PANX3, and STOM) were screened to construct an AAMRGs risk model with prognostic value, providing a new reference for the prognosis and treatment of osteosarcoma.",

Geum japonicum var. chinense (GJC) is used as a traditional Chinese medicine to effectively treat various respiratory conditions. However, the protective effects of GJC against PF remains unclear. In the present study, the anti-PF effect of GJC aqueous extract was studied using a PF mouse model induced by bleomycin (BLM). To characterize the metabolite changes related to PF and reveal therapeutic targets for GJC aqueous extract, we performed metabolomic and network analysis on mice lungs. Finally, key targets were then validated by Western blotting. GJC aqueous extract effectively alleviated the onset and progression of lung fibrosis in PF mice by inhibiting inflammatory responses and regulating oxidative stress levels. Integrating serum metabolomics and network analyses showed the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway to be the most important metabolic pathway of GJC aqueous extract against PF. Further validation of AA pathway protein levels showed a significant rise in the levels of ALOX5, PTGS2, CYP2C9, and PLA2G2A in PF lungs. GJC aqueous extract treatment regulated the above changes in metabolic programming. In conclusion, GJC is a promising botanical drug to delay the onset and progression of PF mice. The primary mechanism of action is associated with the comprehensive regulation of metabolites and protein expression related to the AA metabolic pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exhibits a bidirectional relationship with periodontitis, wherein each condition influences the progression of the other. Arachidonic acid (AA) exerts an anti-diabetic effect, while showing a protective effect by regulating the inflammatory response independently of its metabolites. However, its impact on periodontitis with T2DM remains poorly understood. METHODS: The T2DM mouse model was established by combining a high-sugar and high-fat diet with streptozotocin injection, followed by silk ligation to induce periodontitis. Alterations in diabetes-associated symptoms were evaluated. Micro-computed tomography was used to measure bone-related parameters, including the distance from the cementoenamel junction to the alveolar bone crest, bone volume/total volume and bone mineral density. Targeted metabolomics analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of exogenous AA on serum metabolite levels of AA in mice with type 2 diabetic periodontitis. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was utilized to analyze the microbial diversity. The activity of osteoclasts, levels of inflammatory factors and gene expression related to osteoclasts were investigated using TRAP staining and real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The periodontitis mouse model with T2DM was successfully established. Following two weeks of exogenous AA treatment, a reduction in fasting blood glucose levels was observed in the diabetic periodontitis mice. Exogenous AA alleviated alveolar bone loss in type 2 diabetic periodontitis mice. However, it had no substantial effect on the contents of serum AA-targeted metabolites. Exogenous AA reduced Staphylococcus in subgingival flora of type 2 diabetic periodontitis mice, but had no significant impact on microbial community structure or diversity. Furthermore, it decreased the number of osteoclasts in the alveolar bone of periodontitis with T2DM mice and increased IL-10 mRNA expression in its gingival tissue. CONCLUSION: Exogenous AA may alleviate alveolar bone loss in T2DM mice with periodontitis by reducing the number of osteoclasts and increasing the expression of IL-10 mRNA in periodontal tissues, rather than the change of AA-targeted metabolites in serum or the composition and diversity of microorganisms in subgingival plaque. These findings may provide a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of periodontitis with T2DM.",

      "abstract": "Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis), a crucial commensal bacterium within the gut, has shown connections with hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation regulation. Nonetheless, the role of B. fragilis in the progression of fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) remains unknown. This study aims to explore the ameliorative effects of B. fragilis on FLHS in laying hens, as well as its underlying mechanisms. This is the first study to employ a chicken FLHS model, combining microbiomics and oxylipin metabolomics to investigate the mechanism of action of intestinal symbiotic bacteria. Exp. 1: 40 laying hens at 25 weeks old were randomly divided into five treatment groups (eight replicates per group and one hen per replicate), including the control group (basal diet), the high-energy and low-protein (HELP) group, and the HELP group with three different levels (108, 109, and 1010 CFU) of B. fragilis. Exp. 2: 18 chickens at 25 weeks old were randomly divided into three treatment groups (six replicates per group and one hen per replicate) including the control group (basal diet), the model group (HELP diet), and the arachidonic acid (AA) group (HELP diet with 0.3% AA). The experiment period of Exp. 1 and Exp. 2 were 8 weeks. B. fragilis significantly improved body weight of seventh week (P = 0.006), liver lipid degeneration, blood lipid levels (triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; P < 0.05), and liver function (alanine aminotransferase and aminotransferase; P < 0.05) in laying hens. B. fragilis downregulated the expression of lipid synthesis-related genes fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and liver X receptor α, and inflammation-related genes tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 in the liver of FLHS-affected hens (P < 0.05), while upregulating the expression of lipid oxidation-related genes carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) α, and PPARγ (P < 0.05). The in-depth analysis indicated alterations in oxylipin pathways triggered by B. fragilis, as evidenced by changes in the expression of pivotal genes arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (P < 0.05), subsequently causing modifications in relevant metabolites. This included a decrease in pro-inflammatory substances such as 15-oxoETE (P = 0.004), accompanied by an increase in AA (P = 0.008). B. fragilis regulated the homeostasis of intestinal flora by increasing the abundance of Bacteroides and decreasing the abundance of Succinatimonas and Faecalicoccus (P < 0.05). The integrated analysis revealed a robust positive correlation between Bacteroides abundance and AA levels (P = 0.007). This relationship was corroborated through in vitro experiments. Subsequently, the beneficial effect of AA in mitigating FLHS was confirmed in laying hens with FLHS, further supported by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrating gene expression patterns akin to B. fragilis intervention. This study demonstrated that B. fragilis exerts an anti-FLHS effect through modulation of oxylipin metabolism and gut microbiota stability, with a pivotal role played by AA."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Myocardial inflammation during myocardial infarction (MI) could be inhibited by regulating arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. Recent studies demonstrated that Sini Decoction (SND) was identified to be an effective prescription for treating heart failure (HF) caused by MI. But the anti-inflammatory mechanism of SND remained unclear. The work was designed to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of SND through the AA metabolism pathway in vitro and in vivo experiments. METHODS: An inflammatory injury model of H9c2 cells was established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage-conditioned medium (CM). The MI model was built by the ligation of left anterior descending (LAD) branch of coronary artery in rat. Meanwhile, the rats were divided into five groups: sham group, MI group, MI + Celecoxib group, MI + low-dose SND group (SND-L) and MI + high-dose SND group (SND-H). Cardiac function, histopathological changes and serum cytokines were examined four weeks later. Western blot analysis was conducted to verify the key enzymes levels in the AA metabolic pathway, including phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases (LOXs). RESULTS: These in vivo results demonstrated that SND could improve the cardiac function and pathological changes of rats with MI, and regulate the key inflammatory molecules in the AA metabolism pathway, including sPLA2, COX-1, COX-2, 5-LOX and 15-LOX. In vitro, SND could decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-6 and inhibit cell apoptosis in CM-induced H9c2 cells. Moreover, SND could protect H9c2 cells from the damage of CM by regulating nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signal pathway and the expression of COX-2. CONCLUSION: SND may be a drug candidate for anti-inflammatory treatment during MI by regulating the multiple targets in the AA metabolism pathway."

Although the key 14,15-epoxidation mediated by human cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) 2J2 has been demonstrated, inconsistencies in reported in vitro reaction kinetics have been observed worldwide. The purpose of this study was to clarify the detailed kinetics of arachidonic acid 14,15-expoxidation by recombinant human CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 using precise liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In the absence of an NADPH-generating system, substrate-dependent 14,15-EET was detected in multiple batches of commercially available arachidonic acid at minor but constant levels, regardless of incubation period or P450 concentration. Recombinant CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 mediated minor and extensive arachidonic acid 14,15-epoxidation in a substrate inhibition manner after subtracting 14,15-EET impurities from total 14,15-EET formation. CYP2J2 exhibited similar Michaelis (Km) and substrate inhibition (Ks) constants; however, CYP2C8 had a lower Ks value, indicating more potent substrate inhibition in CYP2C8 than that in CYP2J2. To determine the effects of a given drug on arachidonic acid 14,15-epoxidation during drug development, experiments should be recommended with arachidonic acid of <20 μM for CYP2J2 and <5.0 μM for CYP2C8.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: The therapeutic efficacy of coronary revascularization is compromised by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury. Higher levels of circulating arachidonic acid (AA) are reportedly associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease. The cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway metabolizes AA into prostaglandins (PGs) and the platelet-activating thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is inhibited by aspirin. We aimed to explore whether AA or its combination with aspirin modulates MI/R injury and aspirin-caused gastric bleeding. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were subjected to 30min coronary artery ligation followed by reperfusion. AA reduced MI/R injury in mice, and its combination with aspirin provided further cardioprotection. Aspirin inhibited MI/R-triggered platelet activation and ameliorated microvascular obstruction immediately upon reperfusion, whereas AA improved microvascular perfusion at a later stage of reperfusion, coinciding with increased coronary vasodilatation. Co-administration of AA and aspirin markedly reduced cardiac neutrophil infiltration and vascular permeability and improved microcirculation. AA increased urinary metabolites of PGI2 and PGE2, not TXA2, and this selective augmentation was further enhanced by co-treatment with aspirin. Elevation in PGI2 and PGE2 correlated with reduced infarction and improved ventricular function, and inhibiting COX-2 attenuated the synergistic cadioprotection. Furthermore, oral administration of AA with aspirin after reperfusion provided a maximal cardioprotection and abolished aspirin-caused gastric bleeding. CONCLUSION: AA synergizes with aspirin in protecting against MI/R injury, while minimizing the related bleeding risk, a major concern for patients with acute myocardial infarction. This is attributable to the selective augmentation of PGI2 and PGE2 that is amplified by TXA2 suppression by aspirin, underscoring improved microcirculation and ameliorated inflammation."

Survival and pearl production traits were higher in the ARA treatment group (ARAG) than in the control group (CG). There were 1536 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CG-1d vs ARAG-1d and 833 DEGs in CG-3d vs ARAG-3d. DEGs in CG-1d vs ARAG-1d were mainly enriched in \"NOD-like receiver signaling pathway,\" \"Glycerolipid metabolism,\" and \"Sphingolipid metabolism.\" DEGs in CG-3d vs ARAG-3d were mainly enriched in \"Apoptosis\" and \"ARA metabolism.\" Lipidomics analysis revealed 36 types of lipids. The PC, LPE (22:5), and LPE (18:0) content at 3 d after implantation was lower in the ARAG than in the CG. The PS (37,1) content was significantly higher at 3 d after implantation and the content of ceramides was significantly lower at 1 and 3 d after implantation in the ARAG than in the CG. The results indicated that ARA may alter the composition of lipids, modify the unsaturation of lipids, and regulate apoptosis, immunity, and lipid metabolism in pearl oysters, which enhances pearl production traits. These findings provide theoretical and practical basis for further alleviating the inflammatory response of pearl oysters after implantation.",

Identifying key drivers and therapeutic targets holds significant clinical value. In this study, through comprehensive analysis of multiple PC databases, this work identifies TRIM21 as a promising driver mediator. This work further performs loss- and gain-of-function assays for TRIM21, revealing that TRIM21 knockout inhibits tumor proliferation and gemcitabine resistance both in vitro and vivo. Lipidomics reveal that silencing TRIM21 reduce the arachidonic acid production, and inhibit ferroptosis. Mechanically, through proteomics, ubiquitomics, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, the key metabolic enzyme of arachidonic acid -EPHX1 is identified as a downstream substrate of TRIM21. TRIM21 interacts with EPHX1 through its SPRY domain and promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of EPHX1 via K33- and K48-linked ubiquitination at the K105 site. Given the targeting potential, this work screens Bezafibrate to block the interaction between TRIM21 and EPHX1 and validates its sensitizing effect. In summary, TRIM21 promotes tumour growth and gemcitabine resistance in PC by inhibiting EPHX1-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation is correlated to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Huntington Disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). A lot of recent research and patents are focused on the design and synthesis of arachidonic acid lipoxygenase (ALOX) inhibitors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. AREAS COVERED: The survey covers natural products, synthesis, hybrids, and assessments of biological effects in biological studies as ALOX inhibitors. A survey of patent publications from 2018 to present, taken from Google Scholar, Espanet, Web of Science, Drugbank, Scopus, or PubMed is analyzed. EXPERT OPINION: The authors suggest that (i) numerous areas of biology-pharmacology need to be considered: selectivity, in vivo studies, toxicity, bioavailability, and drug-likeness, the mechanism of action in different animals and humans, evaluation of more efficient and selective biological tests; (ii) synthetic method outbalance in the discovery and production of ALOX inhibitors with greater selectivity. Several ALOX inhibitors show promising results for the treatment of neurological disorders. Their clinical evaluation will be critical to assess therapeutic utility. The compounds for which the mechanism of action and their bioavailability are well defined can be used as lead compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, a traditional Chinese herb, is known for its various biological effects, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antitumor properties. However, the function and mechanisms of methanol extract of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (MESB) in treating hepatic fibrosis remain unclear. METHODS: This study utilized a CCl4-induced mouse model of hepatic fibrosis to assess the effects of MESB through histopathological analysis and serum tests. The anti-fibrosis mechanism of MESB was investigated using qPCR, Western blotting, RNA interference, proteomics, and metabolomics. Spatial metabolomics identified key components of MESB in liver tissue, while molecular docking determined their targets. RESULTS: Treatment with MESB alleviated hepatic pathological changes and reversed hepatic fibrosis in the CCl4-induced models, as evidenced by decreased collagen fibers deposition, reduced expression of hepatic fibrosis markers COL1A1, FN, and PAI-1, and lowered serum levels of AST and ALT. In vitro, MESB inhibited the proliferation of LX-2 cells and the expression of hepatic fibrosis markers. Furthermore, MESB intervention modulated various pathways, particularly those involved in metabolic pathways. Subsequent metabolomics analysis demonstrated that MESB disrupted glycerophospholipid metabolism and suppressed arachidonic acid metabolism. MESB downregulated the expression of cPLA2 in LX-2 cells, leading to decreased production of arachidonic acid and its downstream inflammatory mediators. Meanwhile, MESB inhibited the expression of cPLA2 and its downstream NF-κB pathway in the liver tissues of models induced by CCl4. Additionally, silencing cPLA2 markedly reduced the expressions of COL1A1, FN, and PAI-1. Spatial metabolomics analysis confirmed the penetration of baicalein, wogonin and wogonoside into liver tissue. Further results indicated that baicalein and wogonin inhibited the expression of cPLA2, while baicalin and wogonoside do not exhibit this effect. Moreover, molecular docking suggested that baicalein and wogonin possess the potential to directly interact with cPLA2. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that MESB is crucial in preventing hepatic fibrosis via the cPLA2-mediated arachidonic acid metabolic pathway, highlighting its key active components as potential drugs for fibrosis treatment.",

      "abstract": "AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A), a core constituent of the switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) complex, is mutated in approximately 10% of colorectal cancers. Whereas ARID1A deficiency corresponds to heightened immune activity in colorectal cancer, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown limited efficacy in these tumors. The discovery of targetable vulnerabilities associated with ARID1A deficiency in colorectal cancer could expand treatment options for patients. In this study, we demonstrated that arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism inhibitors synergize with ICIs in ARID1A-deficient colorectal cancer by enhancing the activity of CD8+ T cells and inhibiting vasculogenic mimicry. Epigenetic analysis using ATAC-seq and ChIP-qPCR revealed that the lack of ARID1A results in reduced levels of PTGS1 and PTGS2, the key enzymes that control the AA pathway. Low PTGS1 and PTGS2 expression generated a reliance on the remaining functionality of the AA pathway in ARID1A-deficient cells. The AA pathway inhibitor aspirin selectively inhibited the growth of ARID1A-deficient colorectal cancer, and aspirin sensitized tumors lacking ARID1A to immunotherapy. Together, these findings suggest that blocking AA metabolism can enhance immune responses against tumors by activating CD8+ T cells and inhibiting vasculogenic mimicry, which synergizes with ICIs to improve treatment of ARID1A-deficient colorectal cancer. Significance: The arachidonic acid pathway is a metabolic vulnerability in ARID1A-deficient colorectal cancer that can be targeted with aspirin to suppress tumor growth and enhance sensitivity to immunotherapy, providing a promising therapeutic strategy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heat stress (HS) commonly occurring in summer has gradually become a factor threatening the reproductive performance of male dairy goats by reducing their fecundity. Despite the melatonin is applied to relieve HS, it is still unclear whether melatonin protects against reproductive damage induced by HS in dairy goats and how it works. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the role of melatonin in alleviating HS-induced spermatogenesis dysfunction in male dairy goats and further explore its mechanism. RESULTS: HS impaired spermatogenesis, sperm formation in the testes, and sperm maturation in the epididymis of dairy goats, resulting in decreased sperm quality. Melatonin rescued the decrease of sperm quality induced by HS via decreasing inflammatory and oxidative stress levels in testicular tissue and enhancing intercellular barrier function within the testes. Amplicon-based microbiota analysis revealed that despite gut microbiota differences between melatonin-treated dairy goats and NC dairy goats to some extent, melatonin administration tends to return the gut microbiota of male dairy goats under HS to the levels of natural control dairy goats. To explore whether the protective role of melatonin in sperm quality is mediated by regulating gut microbiota, fecal microbiota of HS dairy goats with or without melatonin treatment were transferred to HS mice, respectively. We found HS mice that had received fecal bacteria of HS dairy goats experienced serious testicular injury and dyszoospermia, while this phenomenon was ameliorated in HS mice that had received fecal bacteria of dairy goats treated with melatonin, indicating melatonin alleviates HS-induced spermatogenic damage in a microbiota dependent manner. We further found that the testicular tissue of both HS dairy goats and mice transplanted with HS dairy goat feces produced large amounts of arachidonic acid (AA)-related metabolites, which were closely associated with semen quality. Consistently, supplementation with AA has been shown to elevate the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in the testicular tissue of mice, disrupting intercellular connections and ultimately leading to spermatogenic disorders. CONCLUSION: This study has revealed that melatonin can effectively alleviate spermatogenic disorders in dairy goats caused by HS. This beneficial effect was primarily achieved through the modulation of gut microbiota, which subsequently inhibited the excessive synthesis of AA in testicular tissue. These discoveries are of great significance for preventing or improving the decline in male livestock reproductive performance caused by HS, enhancing the reproductive efficiency of elite male breeds, and ultimately improving the production efficiency of animal husbandry.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus are Gram-positive bacteria involved in the development of dental caries, as they are able to form biofilms on tooth enamel, ferment sugars into acids, and survive under acidic conditions. This ultimately leads to a local lowering of the pH value on the tooth surface, which causes enamel cavities. HYPOTHESIS: One measure to reduce caries is to limit the growth of cariogenic bacteria by using two anti-bacterial agents with different mechanisms of action. The hypothesis of this study was that the anti-bacterial activity of ω-6 polyunsaturated arachidonic acid (AA) against S. mutans and S. sobrinus can be enhanced by the sesquiterpene alcohol trans, trans-farnesol (t,t-farnesol). METHODS: The anti-bacterial activity of single and combined treatment was determined by the checkerboard assay. Bacterial viability was assessed by live/dead SYTO 9/propidium iodide (PI) staining on flow cytometry. Anti-biofilm activity was determined by MTT metabolic assay, crystal violet staining of biofilm biomass, SYTO 9/PI staining by spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDCM) and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). RESULTS: t,t-Farnesol lowered the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) of AA at sub-MICs. AA reduced the metabolic activity of preformed mature biofilms, while t,t-farnesol had no significant effect. The enhanced anti-bacterial effect of the combined t,t-farnesol/AA treatment was further evidenced by increased PI uptake, indicating membrane perforation. The enhanced anti-biofilm effect was further verified by SDCM and HR-SEM. Gene expression studies showed reduced expression of some biofilm-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our study suggests a potential use of the two naturally occurring compounds arachidonic acid and t,t-farnesol for preventing biofilm formation by the cariogenic bacteria S. mutans and S. sobrinus. These findings have implications for caries prevention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gui-Ling-Ji (GLJ) described in the ancient medical book 'Yunji Qijian' is a traditional Chinese medicine formula used to improve male fertility. It is now available for the treatment of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT). However, the active ingredients and mechanism of GLJ are not clear. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to clarify the active ingredients and mechanism of GLJ in OAT. METHODS: Firstly, the cyclophosphamide-induced OAT rat model was established to evaluate the efficacy of GLJ. Secondly, serum/urine-based metabolomics and lipidomics and tissue-based transcriptomics were performed to discover the differential metabolites and genes in rats. Furthermore, network pharmacology was constructed to explore the associated mechanisms based on the results of multi-omics analysis. Finally, cellular experiment on testicular mesenchymal stromal cells (TM3) was used to validate the active ingredients and the key metabolic pathway. RESULTS: Rats were administered GLJ by gavage every day for 3 weeks. Testicular damage and weight loss caused by cyclophosphamide were restored in rats, the sperm count and motility were improved, and levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone (T) secretion were also elevated. Compared to the metabolites of OAT rats, 51 and 37 differential metabolites regulated by GLJ were identified from serum and urine respectively, 54 lipid differential metabolites regulated by GLJ were identified by lipidomics. At the same time, 23 of the 258 differential genes were found to be regulated by OAT rats and then reverse-regulated by GLJ. Network pharmacology has identified 13 pathways (Steroid hormone biosynthesis, Taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, Primary bile acid biosynthesis, Linoleic acid metabolism, Retinol metabolism, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, Ether lipid metabolism, Sphingolipid metabolism, Arachidonic acid metabolism, Glutathione metabolism, Arginine biosynthesis, Arginine and proline metabolism, D-Arginine and D-ornithine metabolism), four metabolites (arachidonic acid, oestrone sulphate, phosphatidylglycerol choline and sphingomyelin) and 15 targets (ABCB11, ALDH18A1, CCL3, CD244, CIITA, CYP2C8, DLL1, ITGA4, ESR1, AR, ABCB1, ABCC1, ALB, PLA2G1B and NOS2). GLJ, psoralen, isopsoralen, liquiritin, isoliquiritin, liquiritigenin, and ginsenoside Ro could significantly promote T secretion from TM3 cells. Additionally, arachidonic acid metabolism particularly the cyclooxygenase pathway, is closely related to the promotion of testosterone secretion by GLJ in TM3. CONCLUSION: GLJ has a therapeutic efficacy in cyclophosphamide-induced OAT rats, which can modulate the disorders of lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Arachidonic acid metabolism may be a key pathway, and six prototype compounds are potential key active ingredients for GLJ.",

Metabolities in arachidonic acid are crucial lipid signaling molecules involved innumerous physiological processes. In this study, We are the first use eicosanoid metabolomics detrusor contraction examine, to assess the effect of the arachidonic acid metabolic in bladder dysfunction following TSCI. In additon, we explore the time of inflammatory and function changes in bladder tissue. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to improved Weight Drop method surgeries. Detrusor contraction examination, urodynamic examination, eicosanoid metabolomics, transmission electron microscopy, Elisa and histological staining were performed to assess the change of inflammatory, metabolic and function variation over time after TSCI. RESULTS: Following TSCI, before the variations of bladder function, inflammatory changes including the increase of inflammatory factors, mitochondrial damage, and slight lipid peroxidation, occurred in bladder tissue. And the inflammatory changes gradually decreases over time. However, From the third day after TSCI, secondary lesions appeared in bladder tissue. Not only did inflammation-related indexes increase again, the degree of mitochondrial damage and lipid peroxidation increased, but also the contractility of detrusor began to change significantly. We also found that the content of metabolites in arachidonic acid metabolic pathway and the degree of detrusor contractility change showed a strong correlation. In addition, we found that rats had moved beyond the spinal shock stage on the seventh day after TSCI. CONCLUSION: Altogether, we are the first to demonstrate that abnormal arachidonic acid metabolism plays an important role in bladder dysfunction after TSCI. We also demonstrate that 3d is a critical juncture for changes in rat bladder tissue, which indicates it is an important juncture in the treatment of neurogenic bladder.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the impact of this supplementation on intestinal fatty acid composition, structure, and indicators that are supportive of OT development. METHODS: Allergy-prone Brown Norway dams were randomly assigned to a control (0% ARA, 0% DHA) or ARA + DHA diet (0.45% ARA, 0.8% DHA) during suckling (0-3 wk). At weaning (3-8 wk), offspring were randomly assigned to a control (0% ARA, 0% DHA) or ARA + DHA diet (0.5% ARA, 0.5% DHA). At 3 wk, offspring in each group received an oral gavage of sucrose or ovalbumin (OVA) solution for five consecutive days. At 7 wk, all offspring received an intraperitoneal OVA injection. At 8 wk, offspring were terminated to evaluate jejunum morphology and measure mucosal food allergy-related secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and cytokines, ileum phospholipid and triglyceride fatty acid compositions, and fecal calprotectin. RESULTS: Weaning ARA + DHA resulted in a higher percentage of DHA in ileum phospholipids and triglycerides (both P < 0.001), without affecting the percentage of ARA. Despite no lasting effect of suckling ARA + DHA on the DHA content in ileum phospholipids, a programming effect was found on the allergy-related intestinal immune profile [higher concentrations of mucosal IL-2 (P = 0.049) and sIgA (P = 0.033)]. OVA treatment resulted in a lower concentration of mucosal IL-6 (P = 0.026) regardless of dietary interventions. Offspring fed ARA + DHA during suckling and/or weaning had a higher concentration of mucosal transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) after OVA treatment but this was not observed in offspring fed control diets during suckling and weaning (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Early life dietary ARA + DHA supplementation to allergy-prone rats enhanced the DHA concentration in intestinal phospholipids (weaning period) and increased the mucosal sIgA, IL-2, and TGF-β levels (suckling and weaning period), indicating its ability to create a tolerogenic intestinal environment to support OT development.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore how Qingfei Zhisou oral liquid (, QFZS) adjusts body temperature bias and the interaction of inflammatory factors levels and metabolomic differences. METHODS: Dry yeast was subcutaneously injected at 10 mL/kg to establish the pyrexia model. We randomly divided 60 Sprague-Dawley rats into five groups: control, model, positive, low dose of QFZS and high dose of QFZS. Inflammatory proteins were evaluated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. For the examination of the endogenous metabolites, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry were employed. RESULTS: QFZS significantly reduced rats' body temperature within 6 h after dry yeast injection and reduced the secretion of the arginine vasopressin, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, prostaglandin E-2, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β in serum. Meanwhile, we identified 41 metabolites between the model and QFZS groups, including arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids. QFZS restored normal arachidonic acid levels. Based on the differential metabolite enrichment analysis, QFZS's anti-inflammatory and anti-pyrexia effects might be related to the inflammatory pathway regulated by transient receptor potential. Additionally, QFZS treatment reduced transient receptor potential melastatin 2 ion channel expression and affected TNF-α, heat shock protein 70, and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in the hypothalamus. CONCLUSION: QFZS exerts its regulatory effects on fever by regulating the metabolism of lysophospholipids and arachidonic acid and the regulation of inflammation via transient receptor potential ion channels channels.",

Sporidiobolus pararoseus polysaccharides (SPP) have been demonstrated to have anti-rheumatoid and microbiota-modulatory effects; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study employed collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice to explore the metabolic and genetic pathways. The results revealed SPP intervention significantly reduced the serum levels of rheumatoid and pro-inflammatory complement factors. SPP promoted the transition of macrophages of CIA mice toward the M2 phenotype (F4/80+/CD206+) from an inflammatory phenotype (F4/80+/CD86+) using flow cytometry analysis. A total of 44 metabolites were upregulated, and 110 metabolites were significantly downregulated by SPP compared to those in RA group. The decreased metabolites, 12(S)-HPETE, prostaglandin H2, 15-HETE, hepoxilin B3, and 15-keto-prostaglandin F2a, were mostly enriched in arachidonic acid metabolism (enrichment = 11.4 %), which was highly correlated with the anti-rheumatic activity of SPP. Gene expression analysis revealed that SPP significantly regulated OPG/RANKL/TRAF6 signaling pathway, stimulating osteogenic remodeling. Furthermore, arachidonic acid metabolism was identified as the critical metabolic driver of RA phenotypes and osteoclast differentiation, potentially associated with SPP-reshaped intestinal microbiota (i.e., Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Bacteroides, and Parabacteroides). Collectively, this study utilized an integrated approach of metabolomics and gene expression analysis to investigate the regulatory role of SPP in RA progression.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: This research investigated the impact of Cannabistilbene I on Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and its potential role in cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathways. Cardiac hypertrophy, a response to increased stress on the heart, can lead to severe cardiovascular diseases if not managed effectively. CYP enzymes and AA metabolites play critical roles in cardiac function and hypertrophy, making them important targets for therapeutic intervention. Methods: Adult human ventricular cardiomyocyte cell line (AC16) was cultured and treated with Cannabistilbene I in the presence and absence of Ang II. The effects on mRNA expression related to cardiac hypertrophic markers and CYP were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction, while CYP protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis. AA metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: Results showed that Ang II triggered hypertrophy, as evidenced by the increase in hypertrophic marker expression, and enlarged the cell surface area, effects that were alleviated by Cannabistilbene I. Gene expression analysis indicated that Cannabistilbene I upregulated CYP1A1, leading to increased enzymatic activity, as evidenced by 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase assay. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS analysis of AA metabolites revealed that Ang II elevated midchain (R/S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) concentrations, which were reduced by Cannabistilbene I. Notably, Cannabistilbene I selectively increased 19(S)-HETE concentration and reversed the Ang II-induced decline in 19(S)-HETE, suggesting a unique protective role. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the potential of Cannabistilbene I in modulating AA metabolites and reducing Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, revealing a new candidate as a therapeutic agent for cardiac hypertrophy.",

Acupuncture treatment stimulates specific acupoints to adjust qi and blood function, relieving joint inflammation and pain. METHODS: Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) was utilized for non-targeted metabolomics analysis of plasma samples from the blank group, Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis (AIA) model mice model mice group, and acupuncture group. Metabolite hierarchical clustering analysis, multivariate statistical analysis, standardized processing, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and other methods were employed to identify targeted metabolites affected by acupuncture treatment in AIA mice. The related metabolic pathways were analyzed using KEGG pathway. RESULTS: Histopathological results demonstrated that acupuncture at Zusanli point (ST 36) significantly improved the inflammatory response in AIA mice. The PCA score plot indicated relatively close sample clustering within each group with significant differences observed between the four groups, confirming successful establishment of the AIA animal model with metabolic disorders occurring. Acupuncture treatment effectively corrected these metabolic disorders. Plasma metabolomics identified a total of 10 differential metabolites primarily associated with arachidonic acid and pentose phosphate metabolic pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture at ST36 can significantly improve the inflammatory response in AIA mice through modulation of arachidonic acid and pentose phosphate metabolic pathways.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-associated form of dementia characterized by the pathological deposition of toxic misfolded proteins in the central nervous system (CNS), which is closely related to the clearance impairment of meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs). Thus, enhancement dural meningeal lymphatic drainage to remove amyloid-β (Aβ) is usually considered as a potential therapeutic target for AD. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of Jiawei Xionggui Decoction (JWXG) to attenuate cognitive dificits in APP/PS1 mice with impaired meningeal lymphatic drainage. METHODS: Ligation of deep cervical lymph nodes (dcLNs) was performed to establish the mice model of the impaired meningeal lymphatic drainage in APP/PS1 mice. Cognitve behaviors and pathological morphology of mice were assessed. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) of mice was determined using Laser speckle contrast imaging analysis. Serum non-targeted metabolomics analysis was applied to decipher the mechanisms of JWXG in rescuing the impairment of mLVs, and C8-D1A cells were employed to validate in vitro. RESULTS: Disruption of mLVs in APP/PS1 mice deteriorated cognitive dysfunction, accelerated Aβ burden and glia activation, accompanied by more severe neuropathological damage, CBF reduction and neuroinflammation exacerbation. Serum non-targeted metabolomics analysis indicates the increase of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway was the key contributor to the neuropathological exacerbation of dcLNs ligation APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, clinically equivalent dose of JWXG was sufficient to restore mLVs drainage and rescue cognitive performance by inhibiting neuroinflammation depended by AA metabolic pathway in dcLNs ligation APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings establish a novel mechanism that rescue mLVs by inhibiting AA metabolic pathway to clear brain Aβ, and support JWXG as a feasible treatment strategy for AD by suppressing AA metabolic pathway to improve mLVs drainage efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Many drugs can act on multiple targets or disease pathways, regardless of their original purpose. Drug repurposing involves reevaluating existing compounds for new medical uses. This can include repositioning approved drugs, redeveloping unapproved drugs, or repurposing any chemical, nutraceutical, or biotherapeutic product for new applications. Traditional drug development is slow, expensive, and has high failure rates. Drug repurposing can speed up the process, costing less and saving time. This approach can save 6-7 years of early-stage research time. Drug repurposing benefits from existing compounds with optimized structures and approved for clinical use with associated structure-activity relationship publications, supporting the development of new effective compounds. Drug repurposes can now utilize advanced in silico screening enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) and sophisticated tissue and organ-level in vitro models. These models more accurately replicate human physiology and improve the selection of existing drugs for further pre-clinical testing and, eventually, clinical trials for new indications. This mini-review discusses some examples of drug repurposing and novel strategies for further development of compounds for targets of the arachidonic acid cascade. In particular, we will delve into the prospect of repurposing antiplatelet agents for cancer prevention and addressing the emerging noncanonical functionalities of 5-lipoxygenase, potentially for leukemia therapy."

      "abstract": "Cholestatic liver disease is caused by disorders of bile synthesis, secretion, and excretion. Over the long term, progressive liver cell damage from the disease evolves into liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, ultimately leading to liver failure and even cancer. Notably, cholestatic liver disease has a complex pathogenesis that remains relatively unclear. In this study, we generated two mouse models of cholestatic liver disease using a 0.1% 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet and α-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT) gavage. Quantitative proteomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed that arachidonic acid metabolism was a common pathway in both models. Additionally, serum arachidonic acid concentrations were lower in both models than in the control group. Arachidonic acid supplementation in the diet of DDC model mice significantly reduced the levels of serum markers of cholestasis (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, total bile acid, and total bilirubin) and decreased the degree of bile duct hyperplasia and cholestasis. To elucidate the mechanisms by which arachidonic acid improved bile stasis, we analyzed gene expression after arachidonic acid administration and found that Oatp1 was upregulated in the liver tissue of cholestatic mice. Arachidonic acid also increased Oatp1 expression in AML12 cells, which promoted bile acid uptake. Conclusively, our research showed that arachidonic acid mitigates cholestatic liver disease by upregulating Oatp1, promoting bile acid uptake by hepatocytes and participating in intestinal-hepatic circulation. Overall, these results suggest that supplementing foods with arachidonic acid in the daily diet may be an effective treatment strategy for cholestatic liver disease.",

We sought to investigate the effects of new intravenous lipid emulsions designed to contain sufficient DHA and ARA to meet preterm needs, while avoiding liver toxicity. METHODS: Three new lipid emulsions (NLE A-C) were laboratory-generated using high pressure homogenization. First, a long-term experiment evaluated the impact on plasma, liver, and frontal cortex fatty acid composition compared to commercially available lipid emulsions. Lipid emulsions were administered via daily orogastric gavage to four-week-old C57Bl/6 J mice. Next, liver toxicity was evaluated in a murine model of parenteral nutrition-induced hepatosteatosis. Mice were provided an ad lib fat-free high carbohydrate diet, with intravenous lipid emulsion administration every other day for 19 days. RESULTS: Administration of commercially available lipid emulsions (soybean oil, mixed oil, or fish oil) resulted in decreased plasma and tissue levels of DHA and/or ARA compared to a chow control. The new lipid emulsions demonstrated a dose-response effect in plasma and tissue concentration of DHA and ARA. NLE C (with an approximately even DHA:ARA ratio), compared to chow, maintained similar DHA (19.2 ± 0.3 vs. 19.3 ± 0.3%, P = 1.00) and ARA (10.4 ± 0.2 vs. 9.9 ± 0.2% ARA, P = 0.75) content in frontal cortex tissue. All three new lipid emulsions prevented biochemical liver injury and pathologist-assessed hepatosteatosis; soybean oil lipid emulsion and mixed oil lipid emulsion treatment resulted in hepatosteatosis in both experiments. CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with the new lipid emulsions in juvenile mice resulted in increased plasma and tissue DHA and/or ARA content compared to currently available lipid emulsions. The new lipid emulsions also prevented hepatosteatosis and biochemical liver injury with enteral and parenteral administration.",

Studies have shown that fatty acid synthesis is enhanced in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and it is crucial for the cellular reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Fatty acid synthesis increases the cellular lipid contents and, in turn, promotes mitochondrial fission and cellular reprogramming. AA was found to induce acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) expression, a major enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. In this study, we have investigated the regulation of pluripotency, fatty acid synthesis and mitochondrial activities of the human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and the human embryonal carcinoma (hEC) NTERA-2 cells upon treatment with varying concentrations of AA. Our results indicate that a lower concentration of AA can increase pluripotency, as evidenced by an increased expression of pluripotency markers, increased fatty acid synthesis as evidenced by lipid estimation and modulated mitochondrial fission, as evidenced by mitotracker staining for fissioned mitochondria. Moreover, higher concentrations of AA-induced the opposite effect, leading to pluripotent stem cell differentiation. Molecular docking simulations predicted the possible interactions between AA and its metabolites with fatty acid synthesis regulators ACC1 and CREB1 (Cyclic adenosine monophosphate Response Element Binding Protein 1) as a mechanism for AA regulating pluripotency.",

Although the chemotherapy drug cisplatin (DDP) has brought certain benefits to patients, the rapid development of drug resistance has greatly hindered treatment success. METHODS: We used the lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) mRNA data set to explore the differentially expressed gene (RND1) in LUSC and detected RND1 expression in LUSC cells and DDP-resistant cells by qRT-PCR. Meanwhile, we performed abnormal expression treatment on RND1 and conducted CCK8, colony formation, and flow cytometry to evaluate the impact of RND1 expression on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DDP resistance. In addition, we analyzed metabolism pathways involving RND1 using GSEA. We also used online tools such as hTFtarget and JASPAR to screen for the upstream transcription factor FOXA2 of RND1 and verified their relationship through CHIP and dual luciferase experiments. Finally, we validated the role of FOXA2-RND1 in DDP resistance in LUSC through the above experiments. RESULTS: RND1 was downregulated in LUSC, and overexpression of RND1 repressed proliferation and DDP resistance of LUSC cells and facilitated cell apoptosis. RND1 modulated the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism pathway, and FOXA2 positively manipulated RND1 expression. By activating FOXA2, stabilizing RND1, and regulating AA levels, the sensitivity of LUSC cells to DDP could be enhanced. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that FOXA2 positively modulated the RND1-AA pathway, which repressed the resistance of LUSC cells to DDP.",

      "abstract": "Fat and sugar overconsumption is the cause of increasing worldwide incidence of gastrointestinal tract in inflammatory conditions. The intestinal pre-inflammatory alterations are partially reversible, simultaneously inhibiting the predisposition to colitis. Searching for an effective pharmacotherapy for treating inflammatory conditions in the intestine is essential. This study aimed to investigate the effect of cannabigerol (CBG) on the inflammation state in the colon tissue of rats subjected to high-caloric diet. The experiment was conducted on male Wistar rats subjected to a standard or a high-fat high-sucrose diets for six weeks. For the last 14 days, half of rats from both groups received intragastrically cannabigerol solution (30 mg/kg of body mass). The ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA, the activity of n-6 and n-3 PUFA, and arachidonic acid (AA) content in selected lipid fractions were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Immunoblotting examined the expression of proteins involved in inflammation development. ELISA kits measured the content of arachidonic acid derivatives. CBG treatment reduced the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in TAG fraction and increased the n-3 PUFA pathway activity in almost all lipid fractions. Cannabigerol supplementation decreased AA concentration in PL and TAG. CBG also caused diminishments in the expression of cPLA2, COX-1, COX-2, and 12/15-LOX, which was indirectly correlated with a decreased LTB4 level and an increased LXA4 level. We concluded that cannabigerol has a protective influence on the development of inflammation in the colon tissue under lipid and sugar overload condition, thereby favoring cancer initiation and progression.",

Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction (HGWWD) is an effective classic prescription for treating CIPN; however, the mechanism of the activity is not entirely understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the remedial effects and mechanisms of HGWWD on CIPN. METHODS: Changes in behavioral, biochemical, histopathological, and biomarker indices were used to evaluate the efficacy of HGWWD treatment. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry combined with the pattern recognition method was used to screen biomarkers and metabolic pathways related to CIPN. The results of pathway analyses were verified by protein blotting experiments. RESULTS: A total of 29 potential biomarkers were identified and 13 metabolic pathways were found to be involved in CIPN. In addition HGWWD reversed the levels of 19 biomarkers. Prostaglandin H2 and 17α,21-dihydroxypregnenolone were targeted as core biomarkers. CONCLUSION: This study provides scientific evidence to support the finding that HGWWD mainly inhibits the inflammatory response during CIPN by regulating arachidonic acid metabolism.",

Besides, Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) plays a crucial role in maintaining liver homeostasis. METHODS: This study used Yap1 Flox/Flox, Albumin-Cre mice with hepatocyte-specific Yap1 knockout (referred to as Yap1 LKO) and their control mice (Yap1 Flox/Flox, referred to as Yap1 Flox). The effect of Yap1 on lipid metabolism homeostasis was investigated through non-targeted metabolomic analysis of mouse liver. Subsequently, DHA was administered to Yap1 LKO mice to assess its potential as a treatment. Liver pathology was evaluated via H&E staining, and the levels of AST, ALT, and TG were quantified using biochemical assays. The contents of arachidonic acid (AA), prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), and leukotrienes (LT) in the liver were measured using ELISA, while the protein expressions of PLIN2, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were analyzed through IHC staining. RESULTS: Hepatocyte-specific Yap1 knockout activated the AA metabolic pathway, resulting in increased elevated levels of AA, PGE1, and LT levels, along with inflammatory cytokine infiltration. DHA mitigated the elevation of metabolites such as PGE1 and LT caused by the AA metabolic pathway activation by down-regulating the levels of COX-2 and 5-LOX in the liver of Yap1 LKO mice. Moreover, it alleviated the accumulation of lipid vacuoles and reduced triglyceride (TG) and perilipin-2 (PLIN2) levels in the liver of Yap1 LKO mice. CONCLUSIONS: Excessively low YAP1 expression induces liver inflammation and disturbances in lipid metabolism, whereas DHA modulated AA metabolism and mitigated liver inflammation by inhibiting the activation of 5-LOX and COX-2."

Quercetin is among the widely occurring polypheno found abundantly in nature. Quercetin has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-viral properties. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of quercetin on PRRSV-induced inflammation in MARC-145 cells. METHODS: Observing the cytopathic effect and measurements of inflammatory markers in MARC-145 cells collectively demonstrate that quercetin elicits a curative effect on PRRSV-induced inflammation. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was further used for a non-targeted metabolic analysis of the role of quercetin in the metabolic regulation of PRRSV inflammation in MARC-145 cells. RESULTS: It was shown that quercetin attenuated PRRSV-induced cytopathy in MARC-145 cells. Quercetin treatment inhibited PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that quercetin inhibited PRRSV-induced mRNA expression and secretion levels of tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1β and interleukin 6. Metabolomics analysis revealed that quercetin ameliorated PRRSV-induced inflammation. Pathway analysis results revealed that PRRSV-induced pathways including arachidonic acid metabolism, linoleic acid, glycerophospholipid and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism were suppressed by quercetin. Moreover, we confirmed that quercetin inhibited the activation of NF-κB/p65 pathway, probably by attenuating PLA2, ALOX and COX mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a crucial insight into the molecular mechanism of quercetin in alleviating PRRSV-induced inflammation.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the hypoglycemic mechanism of guava polysaccharides (GP) through the gut microbiota (GM) and related metabolites. Our findings demonstrated that GP significantly mitigated high-fat diet- and streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, high hepatic inflammation levels, and prevented pancreatic atrophy and hepatomegaly. Interestingly, the benefits of GP were attributed to alterations in the GM. GP decreased the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, significantly inhibiting deleterious bacteria, including Uncultured_f_Desulfovibrionaceae, Bilophila, and Desulfovibrio, while promoting the proliferation of probiotic Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides. In addition, GP promoted the generation of short-chain fatty acids. Notably, the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism pathway was enriched in liver metabolites. GP significantly elevated hepatic AA and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, while reducing prostaglandin E2 and 5- and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. This modulation is accompanied by the downregulation of hepatic cyclooxygenase-1, 12-lipoxygenase, P38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase mRNA expression, and the upregulation of cytochrome P4502J5 and insulin receptor substrate 1/2 mRNA expression. However, GP antibiotic treatment did not induce significant alterations in FBG and AA levels or gene expression. Overall, our findings suggest that the hypoglycemic effect of GP may be intricately linked to alterations in AA metabolism, which depends on the GM.",

      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are a major global health burden, representing 20% of all cancer diagnoses and 22.5% of global cancer-related deaths. Their aggressive nature and resistance to treatment pose a significant challenge, with late-stage survival rates below 15% at five years. Therefore, there is an urgent need to delve deeper into the mechanisms of gastrointestinal cancer progression and optimize treatment strategies. Increasing evidence highlights the active involvement of abnormal arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in various cancers. AA is a fatty acid mainly metabolized into diverse bioactive compounds by three enzymes: cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P450 enzymes. Abnormal AA metabolism and altered levels of its metabolites may play a pivotal role in the development of GI cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This review highlights a unique perspective by focusing on the abnormal metabolism of AA and its involvement in GI cancers. We summarize the latest advancements in understanding AA metabolism in GI cancers, outlining changes in AA levels and their potential role in liver, colorectal, pancreatic, esophageal, gastric, and gallbladder cancers. Moreover, we also explore the potential of targeting abnormal AA metabolism for future therapies, considering the current need to explore AA metabolism in GI cancers and outlining promising avenues for further research. Ultimately, such investigations aim to improve treatment options for patients with GI cancers and pave the way for better cancer management in this area.",

      "abstract": "Dental caries is a global health problem that requires better prevention measures. One of the goals is to reduce the prevalence of the cariogenic Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus mutans. We have recently shown that naturally occurring arachidonic acid (AA) has both anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activities against this bacterium. An important question is how these activities are affected by other anti-bacterial compounds commonly used in mouthwashes. Here, we studied the combined treatment of AA with chlorhexidine (CHX), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), triclosan, and fluoride. Checkerboard microtiter assays were performed to determine the effects on bacterial growth and viability. Biofilms were quantified using the MTT metabolic assay, crystal violet (CV) staining, and live/dead staining with SYTO 9/propidium iodide (PI) visualized by spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDCM). The bacterial morphology and the topography of the biofilms were visualized by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). The effect of selected drug combinations on cell viability and membrane potential was investigated by flow cytometry using SYTO 9/PI staining and the potentiometric dye DiOC2(3), respectively. We found that CHX and CPC had an antagonistic effect on AA at certain concentrations, while an additive effect was observed with triclosan and fluoride. This prompted us to investigate the triple treatment of AA, triclosan, and fluoride, which was more effective than either compound alone or the double treatment. We observed an increase in the percentage of PI-positive bacteria, indicating increased bacterial cell death. Only AA caused significant membrane hyperpolarization, which was not significantly enhanced by either triclosan or fluoride. In conclusion, our data suggest that AA can be used together with triclosan and fluoride to improve the efficacy of oral health care."

      "abstract": "An imbalance of energy intake and expenditure is commonly considered as the fundamental cause of obesity. However, individual variations in susceptibility to obesity do indeed exist in both humans and animals, even among those with the same living environments and dietary intakes. To further explore the potential influencing factors of these individual variations, male C57BL/6J mice were used for the development of obesity-prone and obesity-resistant mice models and were fed high-fat diets for 16 weeks. Compared to the obesity-prone mice, the obesity-resistant group showed a lower body weight, liver weight, adipose accumulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. 16S rRNA sequencing, which was conducted for fecal microbiota analysis, found that the fecal microbiome's structural composition and biodiversity had changed in the two groups. The genera Allobaculumbiota, SMB53, Desulfovibrio and Clostridium increased in the obesity-prone mice, and the genera Streptococcus, Odoribacter and Leuconostoc were enriched in the obesity-resistant mice. Using widely targeted metabolomics analysis, 166 differential metabolites were found, especially those products involved in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, which were significantly reduced in the obesity-resistant mice. Moreover, KEGG pathway analysis exhibited that AA metabolism was the most enriched pathway. Significantly altered bacteria and obesity-related parameters, as well as AA metabolites, exhibited strong correlations. Overall, the phenotypes of the obesity-prone and obesity-resistant mice were linked to gut microbiota and AA metabolism, providing new insight for developing an in-depth understanding of the driving force of obesity resistance and a scientific reference for the targeted prevention and treatment of obesity.",

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) represents the most prevalent form of secondary osteoporosis. Aucubin (AU), a principal active component found in traditional herbal medicines such as Eucommia ulmoides, has been demonstrated to enhance osteoblast differentiation. Nonetheless, the precise therapeutic effects of AU on GIOP and the complex underlying regulatory mechanisms warrant further investigation. We first established a GIOP model in female mice and then assessed the therapeutic effects of AU using micro-CT analysis, biomechanical testing, measurements of serum calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) levels, and histological analyses using Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) and Masson staining. Subsequently, non-targeted metabolomics was employed in order to study the effects of AU on serum metabolites in GIOP mice. The levels of the factors related to these metabolites were quantified using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses. Finally, the effects of AU on osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation were examined. We found that AU significantly ameliorated bone microarchitecture and strength in GIOP mice. It mitigated pathological damages such as impairment of trabecular bone structure and reduction in collagen fibers, while concurrently elevating serum levels of Ca and P. Non-targeted metabolomics revealed that Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism serves as a common pathway between the control and GIOP groups, as well as between the high-dose AU (AUH) and GIOP groups. AU notably upregulates prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and microsomal prostaglandin-E synthase 1 (PTGES) expression and downregulates prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase (PTGDS) expression. Furthermore, AU treatment increased the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and transcription factor Sp7 (Osterix), enhanced serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and reduced osteoclast expression. These results indicate that AU is a potential drug for treating GIOP, and its mechanism is related to regulating AA metabolism and promoting osteoblast differentiation. However, the key targets of AU in treating GIOP still need further exploration.",

We herein examine mechanisms underlying ARA schistosomicidal potential over two experiments, using in each pool a minimum of 50 adult male, female, or mixed-sex freshly recovered, ex vivo S. mansoni. Worms incubated in fetal calf serum-free medium were exposed to 0 or 10 mM ARA for 1 h at 37 °C and immediately processed for preparation of surface membrane and whole worm body homogenate extracts. Mixed-sex worms were additionally used for evaluating the impact of ARA exposure on the visualization of outer membrane cholesterol, sphingomyelin (SM), and ceramide in immunofluorescence assays. Following assessment of protein content, extracts of intact and ARA-treated worms were examined and compared for SM content, neutral sphingomyelinase activity, reactive oxygen species levels, and caspase 3/7 activity. Arachidonic acid principally led to perturbation of the organization, integrity, and SM content of the outer membrane of male and female worms and additionally impacted female parasites via stimulating neutral sphingomyelinase activity and oxidative stress. Arachidonic powerful action on female worms combined with its previously documented ovocidal activities supports its use as safe and effective therapy against schistosomiasis, provided implementation of the sorely needed and long waited-for chemical synthesis."

Si-Wu-Tang (SWT), a traditional Chinese medicine decoction has shown therapeutic effects on various liver diseases. However, the hepatoprotective effects and underlying mechanism of SWT on MAFLD remain unclear. METHODS: First, a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice model was used and lipidomic analysis and transcriptomic analysis were performed. The contents of total iron ions, ferrous ions, and lipid peroxidation were detected and Prussian blue staining was performed to confirm the protective effects of SWT against ferroptosis. Finally, chemical characterization and network pharmacological analysis were employed to identify the potential active ingredients. RESULTS: Serological and hepatic histopathological findings indicated SWT's discernible therapeutic impact on MCD diet-induced MAFLD. Lipidomic analysis revealed that SWT improved intrahepatic lipid accumulation by inhibiting TG synthesis and promoting TG transport. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that SWT ameliorated abnormal FA metabolism by inhibiting FA synthesis and promoting FA β-oxidation. Then, ferroptosis phenotype experiments revealed that SWT could effectively impede hepatocyte ferroptosis, which was induced by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4)-mediated esterification of arachidonic acid (AA). Finally, chemical characterization and network pharmacological analysis identified that paeoniflorin and other active ingredients might be responsible for the regulative effects against ferroptosis and MAFLD. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study revealed the intricate mechanism through which SWT improved MCD diet-induced MAFLD by targeting FA metabolism and ferroptosis in hepatocytes, thus offering a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of MAFLD and its complications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging-related type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is characterized by hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and β-cell dysfunction. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be unclear. METHODS: We conducted non-targeted metabolomics to compare human serum samples from young adults (YA), elderly adults (EA), and elderly adults with diabetes (EA + DM) of Chinese population. Adult mice and aged mice were intragastrically administered with varespladib every day for two weeks and metabolic characteristics were monitored. Serum levels of arachidonic acid, insulin, and C-peptide, as well as serum activity of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) were detected in mice. Mouse islet perfusion assays were used to assess insulin secretion ability. Phosphorylated AKT levels were measured to evaluate insulin sensitivities of peripheral tissues in mice. RESULTS: Non-targeted metabolomics analysis of human serum samples revealed differential metabolic signatures among the YA, EA, and EA + DM groups. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed significant enhancement of arachidonic acid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism in the EA group compared with the YA group. Further analysis identified two metabolic fluxes that favored the accumulation of arachidonic acid in the elderly. Increased levels of arachidonic acid were also confirmed in aged mice with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, together with subsequent glucose intolerance. Conversely, inhibiting the generation of arachidonic acid with varespladib, an inhibitor of sPLA2, reduced aging-associated diabetes by improving hyperinsulinemia and hepatic insulin resistance in aged mice but not in adult mice. Islet perfusion assays also showed that varespladib treatment suppressed the enhanced insulin secretion observed in aged islets. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings uncover that arachidonic acid serves as a metabolic hub in Chinese elderly population. Our results also suggest that arachidonic acid plays a fundamental role in regulating β-cell function during aging and point to a novel therapy for aging-associated diabetes.",

      "abstract": "This research aimed to clarify the impacts of cannflavin-C on angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and their potential role in modulating cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites. Currently there is no evidence to suggest that cannflavin-C, a prenylated flavonoid, has any significant effects on the heart or cardiac hypertrophy. The metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) into midchain hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), facilitated by CYP1B1 enzyme, plays a role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, which is marked by enlarged cardiac cells. Adult human ventricular cardiomyocyte (AC16) cell line was cultured and exposed to cannflavin-C in the presence and absence of Ang II. The assessment of mRNA expression pertaining to cardiac hypertrophic markers and cytochromes P450 (P450s) was conducted via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas the quantification of P450 protein levels was carried out through western blot analysis. Ang II induced hypertrophic markers myosin heavy chain (β/α-MHC), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and increased cell surface area, whereas cannflavin-C mitigated these effects. Gene and protein expression analysis revealed that cannflavin-C downregulated CYP1B1 gene expression, protein level, and enzyme activity assessed by 7-methoxyresorufin O-deethylase (MROD). Arachidonic acid metabolites analysis, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), demonstrated that Ang II increased midchain (R/S)-HETE concentrations, which were attenuated by cannflavin-C. This study provides novel insights into the potential of cannflavin-C in modulating arachidonic acid metabolites and attenuating Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, highlighting the importance of this compound as potential therapeutic agents for cardiac hypertrophy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study demonstrates that cannflavin-C offers protection against cellular hypertrophy induced by angiotensin II. The significance of this research lies in its novel discovery, which elucidates a mechanistic pathway involving the inhibition of CYP1B1 by cannflavin-C. This discovery opens up new avenues for leveraging this compound in the treatment of heart failure.",

Given the need for further research on SAH, our group conducted studies to elucidate its mechanisms and active substances. METHODS: An FS rat pup model was constructed through intraperitoneal injection of LPS and hyperthermia induction. Behavioural indicators of seizures, hippocampal histopathological alterations, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and hippocampal levels of neurotransmitters were observed and measured to investigate the effects of SAH on FS model rats. Hippocampal metabolomics and network pharmacology analyses were conducted to reveal the differential metabolites, key peptides and pathways involved in the suppression of FS by SAH. RESULTS: SAH suppressed FS, decreased the inflammatory response and regulated the Glu-GABA balance. Metabolomic analysis revealed 13 biomarkers of FS, of which SAH improved the levels of 8 differential metabolites. Combined with network pharmacology, a \"biomarker-core target-key peptide\" network was constructed. The peptides of SAH, such as YGQL and LTGGF, could exert therapeutic effects via the arachidonic acid pathway. Molecular docking and ELISA results indicated that functional peptides of SAH could bind to PTGS2 target, inhibiting the generation of AA and its metabolites in hippocampal samples. CONCLUSION: In summary, the functional peptides contained in SAH are the main material basis for the treatment of FS, potentially acting through neurotransmitter regulation and the arachidonic acid pathway."

      "abstract": "The success of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in acute promyelocytic leukemia has driven a plethora studies to investigate its efficacy in other malignancies. However, the inherent toxicity of ATO limits the expansion of its clinical applications. Such toxicity may be linked to ATO-induced metabolic derangements of endogenous substrates. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ATO on the hepatic formation of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), as well as their most notable producing machinery, cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. For this purpose, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 8 mg/kg ATO for 6 and 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from harvested liver tissues for qPCR analysis of target genes. Hepatic microsomal proteins underwent incubation with AA, followed by identification/quantification of the produced HETEs. ATO downregulated Cyp2e1, while induced Cyp2j9 and most of Cyp4a and Cyp4f, and this has resulted in a significant increase in 17(S)-HETE and 18(R)-HETE, while significantly decreased 18(S)-HETE. Additionally, ATO induced Cyp4a10, Cyp4a14, Cyp4f13, Cyp4f16, and Cyp4f18, resulting in a significant elevation in 20-HETE formation. In conclusion, ATO altered hepatic AA metabolites formation through modulating the underlying network of CYP enzymes. Modifying the homeostatic production of bioactive AA metabolites, such as HETEs, may entail toxic events that can, at least partly, explain ATO-induced hepatotoxicity. Such modification can also compromise the overall body tolerability to ATO treatment in cancer patients.",

Here, we report that PIK3CA mutant tumor cells transmit oncogenic signals and result in malignant transformation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) via paracrine exosomal arachidonic acid (AA)-induced H3K4 trimethylation. Mechanistically, PIK3CA mutations sustain SGK3-FBW7-mediated stability of the cPLA2 protein, leading to the synthetic increase in AA, which is transported through exosome and accumulated in IECs. Transferred AA directly binds Menin and strengthens the interactions of Menin and MLL1/2 methyltransferase. Finally, the combination of VTP50469, an inhibitor of the Menin-MLL interaction, and alpelisib synergistically represses PDX tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations. Together, these findings unveil the metabolic link between PIK3CA mutant tumor cells and the IECs, highlighting AA as the potential target for the treatment of patients with CRC harboring PIK3CA mutations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the potential radiotoxicity in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients with high-dose 131I therapy, the alterations and regulatory mechanisms dependent on intestinal microecology remain poorly understood. We aimed to identify the characteristics of the gut microbiota and metabolites in DTC patients suffering from high-dose 131I therapy and explore the radioprotective mechanisms underlying arachidonic acid (ARA) treatment. METHODS: A total of 102 patients with DTC were recruited, with fecal samples collected before and after 131I therapy for microbiome and untargeted and targeted metabolomic analyses. Mice were exposed to total body irradiation with ARA replenishment and antibiotic pretreatment and were subjected to metagenomic, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses. RESULTS: 131I therapy significantly changed the structure of gut microbiota and metabolite composition in patients with DTC. Lachnospiraceae were the most dominant bacteria after 131I treatment, and metabolites with decreased levels and pathways related to ARA and linoleic acid were observed. In an irradiation mouse model, ARA supplementation not only improved quality of life and recovered hematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems but also ameliorated oxidative stress and inflammation and preserved enteric microecology composition. Additionally, antibiotic intervention eliminated the radioprotective effects of ARA. Proteomic analysis and ursolic acid pretreatment showed that ARA therapy greatly influenced intestinal lipid metabolism in mice subjected to irradiation by upregulating the expression of hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 1. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight that ARA, as a key metabolite, substantially contributes to radioprotection. Our study provides novel insights into the pivotal role that the microbiota-metabolite axis plays in radionuclide protection and offers effective biological targets for treating radiation-induced adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder in airways with typical pathologic features of airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion. α-Terpineol is a monocyclic terpene found in many natural plants and foods. It has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects. However, the role of α-terpineol in asthma and its potential protective mechanism have not been well elucidated. This study is designed to investigate the pharmacological effect and mechanism of α-terpineol on asthmatic mice using the metabolomics platform. A murine model of asthma was established using ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and then challenged for one week. The leukocyte count and inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung histopathology, inflammatory  infiltrate and mucus secretion were evaluated. An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics study was performed on lung tissues and serum to explore endogenous small molecule metabolites affected by α-terpineol in asthmatic mice. After α-terpineol treatment, leukocyte count, inflammatory cytokines in the BALF, and peribronchial inflammation infiltration were significantly downregulated. Goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus secretion were attenuated, with the level of Muc5ac in BALF decreased. These results proved the protective effect of α-terpineol against airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and Th1/Th2 immune imbalance. To further investigate the underlying mechanisms of α-terpineol in asthma treatment, UPLC-MS/MS-based metabolomics analysis was performed. 26 and 15 identified significant differential metabolites were found in the lung tissues and serum of the control, model and α-terpineol groups, respectively. Based on the above differential metabolites, enrichment analysis showed that arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism was reprogrammed in both mouse lung tissues and serum. 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are the key enzyme and the end product of AA metabolism, respectively. In-depth studies have shown that pretreatment with α-terpineol can alleviate asthma by decreasing the AA level, downregulating the expression of 5-LOX and reducing the accumulation of CysLTs in mouse lung tissues. In summary, this study demonstrates that α-terpineol is a potential agent that can prevent asthma via regulating disordered AA metabolism.",

Dysregulations in fatty acids metabolism are associated with neuroprotection and neuroinflammation. However, the effect of Cop on fatty acids metabolomics during anti-IR remains unclear. METHODS: Cerebral IR rats were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion, and the therapeutic effect of Cop was evaluated by 2, 3, 5-triphenytetrazolium chloride staining and neurological deficits scores. By liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), fatty acids metabolomics analysis in ischaemic hemisphere and serum were investigated. RESULTS: We observed Cop (2 mg/kg/qd) was able to reduce cerebral infarct size and ameliorate the neurological function score. Meanwhile decrease in tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) after Cop treatment. Compared with control, down-regulation of cyclopentenone PGs (e.g., PGA2, PGJ2, and 15-deoxy- delta-12,14-PGJ2) was observed in cerebral IR, but upregulation of them when followed by Cop treatment. Similarly, we found the ratios of 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid(14,15-DHET)/arachidonic acid and 11,12-DHET/arachidonic acid was lower in cerebral IR injury relative to control, while their ratios were increased after Cop treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that Cop protect against cerebral IR injury, and its mechanism might be closely associated with antiinflammation and the regulation of arachidonic acid metabolism.",

However, there has been some concern regarding possible neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as cognitive impairment and dependence, emerging after abstinence. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the mechanism underlying cognitive impairment during MDMA withdrawal. To achieve this, we focused on the arachidonic acid cascade, which is related to addiction to some abusive drugs. METHODS: A novel object recognition task was used to investigate cognitive function in mice. Furthermore, we quantified prostaglandin E2 during MDMA withdrawal. RESULTS: The recognition index significantly decreased during withdrawal after repeated administration of MDMA (10mg/kg, i.p., once daily for 7 days), but not following co-administration of diclofenac (10mg/kg, i.p.), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. On day 1, following repeated MDMA treatment, prostaglandin E2 content significantly increased in the hippocampus but not in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that activation of the arachidonic acid cascade at least in the hippocampus is likely involved in the development of recognition memory impairment during MDMA withdrawal. Therefore, co-use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors with MDMA may reduce concerns regarding MDMA-induced impairment of recognition memory.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a debilitating mood disorder with an unclear etiology. A better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms will help to identify novel targets for improved treatment options and prevention strategies. In this metabolome-wide Mendelian randomization study, we screened for metabolites that may have a causal role in BPD. METHODS: We tested a total of 913 circulating metabolite exposures assessed in 14,296 Europeans using a mass spectrometry-based platform. For the BPD outcome, we used summary data from the largest and most recent genome-wide association study reported to date, including 41,917 BPD cases. RESULTS: We identified 33 metabolites associated with BPD (padjusted < 5.48 × 10-5). Most of them were lipids, including arachidonic acid (β = -0.154, SE = 0.023, p = 3.30 × 10-11), a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid, along with several complex lipids containing either an arachidonic or a linoleic fatty acid side chain. These associations did not extend to other closely related psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia or depression, although they may be involved in the regulation of lithium response. These lipid associations were driven by genetic variants within the FADS1/2/3 gene cluster, which is a robust BPD risk locus encoding a family of fatty acid desaturase enzymes that are responsible for catalyzing the conversion of linoleic acid into arachidonic acid. Statistical colocalization analyses indicated that 27 of the 33 metabolites shared the same genetic etiology with BPD at the FADS1/2/3 cluster, demonstrating that our findings are not confounded by linkage disequilibrium. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings support the notion that arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids may represent potential targets for BPD.",

This has not been examined for treatment with protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors such as evolocumab, which are increasingly used instead of lipoprotein apheresis in treatment-resistant familial hypercholesterolemia. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of evolocumab treatment and lipoprotein apheresis on the fatty acid profile and on formation of lipid mediators in blood samples. METHODS: We analyzed blood samples from 37 patients receiving either lipoprotein apheresis or evolocumab treatment as part of a previous study. Patients were stratified according to receiving lipoprotein apheresis (n = 19) and evolocumab treatment (n = 18). Serum fatty acid analysis was performed using gas chromatography flame ionization detection and plasma oxylipin analysis was done using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Changing from lipoprotein apheresis to evolocumab treatment led to lower levels of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-6 PUFA) including arachidonic acid, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid and linoleic acid. Moreover, several n-6 PUFA-derived oxylipins were reduced after evolocumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Given that arachidonic acid, either directly or as a precursor, is associated with the development of inflammation and atherosclerosis, evolocumab-mediated reductions of arachidonic acid and its metabolites might have an additional beneficial effect to lower cardiovascular risk."

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a complex vascular disorder characterized by the deposition of lipids, inflammatory cascades, and plaque formation in arterial walls. A thorough understanding of its causes and progression is necessary to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Recent breakthroughs in metabolomics have provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms and genetic factors involved in atherosclerosis, leading to innovative approaches for preventing and treating the disease. In our study, we analyzed clinical serum samples from both atherosclerosis patients and animal models using laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. By employing methods such as orthogonal partial least-squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA), heatmaps, and volcano plots, we can accurately classify atherosclerosis (AUC = 0.892) and identify key molecules associated with the disease. Specifically, we observed elevated levels of arachidonic acid and its metabolite, leukotriene B4, in atherosclerosis. By inhibiting arachidonic acid and monitoring its downstream metabolites, we discovered the crucial role of this metabolic pathway in regulating atherosclerosis. Metabolomic research provides detailed insights into the metabolic networks involved in atherosclerosis development and reveals the close connection between abnormal metabolism and the disease. These studies offer new possibilities for precise diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of disease progression, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions."

      "abstract": "AIM: Patients with diabetes mellitus have poor prognosis after myocardial ischemic injury. However, the mechanism is unclear and there are no related therapies. We aimed to identify regulators of diabetic myocardial ischemic injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mass spectrometry-based, non-targeted metabolomic approach was used to profile coronary sinus blood from diabetic and non-diabetic Bama-mini pigs at 0.5-h post coronary artery ligation. Six metabolites had a |log2 (Fold Change)|> 1.3. Among them, the most changed is arachidonic acid (AA), levels of which were 32 times lower in diabetic pigs than in non-diabetic pigs. The AA-derived products, PGI2 and 6-keto-PGF1α, were also significantly reduced. AA treatment of cultured cardiomyocytes protected against cell death by 30% at 48 h of high glucose and oxygen deprivation, which coincided with increased mitophagic activity (as indicated by increased LC3II/LC3I, decreased p62 and increased parkin & PINK1), improved mitochondrial renewal (upregulation of Drp1 and FIS1), reduced ROS generation and increased ATP production. These cardioprotective effects were abolished by PINK1(a crucial mitophagy protein) knockdown or the autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine. The protective effect of AA was also inhibited by indomethacin and Cay10441, a prostacyclin receptor antagonist. Furthermore, diabetic Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to coronary ligation for 40 min and AA treatment (10 mg/day per animal gavaged) decreased myocardial infarct size, cell apoptosis index, inflammatory cytokines and improved heart function. Scanning electron microscopy showed more intact mitochondria in the border zone of infarcted myocardium in AA treated rats. Lastly, diabetic patients after myocardial infarction had lower plasma levels of AA and 6-keto-PGF1α and reduced cardiac ejection fraction, compared with non-diabetic patients after myocardial infarction. Plasma AA level was inversely correlated with fasting blood glucose. CONCLUSIONS: AA protects against diabetic ischemic myocardial damage by promoting mitochondrial autophagy and renewal, which is related to AA derived PGI2 signaling. AA may represent a new strategy to treat diabetic myocardial ischemic injury.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: CFTR, which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter family and whose members are always involved in cancer progression, is implicated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression, but the underlying mechanism remains undefined. Therefore, this study intended to investigate how CFTR works exactly on LUAD progression. METHODS: Bioinformatics methods were utilized to analyze GATA6 and CFTR expression in LUAD and targeting relationship, followed by a pathway enrichment analysis of CFTR. GATA6 and CFTR expression levels were assessed by qRT-PCR. Cell viability and proliferation were detected through MTT and colony formation assays. An arachidonic acid (AA) assay kit was utilized to measure AA content. mRNA and protein expression levels of genes (cPLA2, COX-2, and CYP1A1) related to the AA metabolism pathway were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Moreover, the Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and ChIP were used to verify the binding of GATA6 and CFTR promoters. RESULTS: GATA6 and CFTR were lowly expressed in LUAD, and CFTR was enriched in the AA metabolism pathway. GATA6 activated CFTR transcription. Cellular and rescue experiments revealed that low or high CFTR expression could foster or hamper LUAD cell viability and proliferation, and concomitant treatment of indomethacin, an AA metabolism pathway inhibitor, mitigated stimulation on LUAD progression by low CFTR expression. Silencing of GATA6 reversed the suppressive impact of CFTR overexpression on LUAD progression via modulation of the AA metabolism pathway. CONCLUSION: The activation of CFTR by GATA6 hampered LUAD progression by modulating the AA metabolism pathway, suggesting that GATA6/CFTR axis might be a therapeutic target for LUAD patients.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Zishen Yutai pills (ZYP), a Chinese medicinal formulation derived from the Qing Dynasty prescription \"Shou Tai pills\", have been documented to exhibit beneficial effects in clinical observations treating premature ovarian failure (POF). However, the anti-POF effects and its comprehensive systemic mechanism have not yet been clarified. AIM OF THE REVIEW: Therapeutic effects and systemic mechanism of ZYP in POF were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After pulverization, sieving, and stirring, ZYP was administered intragastrically to cisplatin-induced POF mice at a dose of 1.95 mg/kg/d for 14 days. The anti-POF effects of ZYP were investigated by assessing the number of ovarian follicles at different developmental stages, as well as measuring serum estradiol (E2) levels and ovarian-expressed anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). Reproductive performance and offspring health were evaluated to predict fertility restoration. Furthermore, a combination of proteomic and metabolomic profiling was employed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of ZYP in treating POF. Western blot (WB) analyses and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were conducted to explore the mechanisms through which ZYP exerted its anti-POF effects. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that oral administration of ZYP reversed the reduction in follicles at different developmental stages and stimulated the expressions of serum E2 and ovarian-expressed AMH in a cisplatin-induced POF model. Additionally, ZYP ameliorated follicle apoptosis in ovaries affected by cisplatin-induced POF. Furthermore, treatment with ZYP restored the quantity and quality of oocytes, as well as enhanced fertility. Our results revealed 62 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) through proteomic analyses and identified 26 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) through metabolomic analyses. Both DEPs and DEMs were highly enriched in the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism pathway. ZYP treatment effectively upregulated the protein and mRNA expression of critical targets in AA metabolism and the AKT pathway, including CYP17α1, HSD3β1, LHR, STAR, and AKT, in cisplatin-induced POF mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that ZYP exerted protective effects against POF and restored fertility from cisplatin-induced apoptosis. ZYP could be a satisfying alternative treating POF.",

In this study, the right hind limb of SD rats was struck by a 1 kg weight, causing traumatic blood stasis (TBS) model, then the rats were gavaged with PS (at ratios of 1:0, 0:1, 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3) for 5 consecutive days. At the end of treatment, blood samples were collected for blood rheology and metabolomics analysis, and muscle tissues of injured limbs were used for HE staining and q-PCR analysis. The results showed that different ratios of PS reduced swelling and improved stasis and blood viscosity in the injured limbs of rats, and intervened in metabolism by modulating 11, 11, 17, 15, and 13 differential metabolites, respectively. The PS (3:1) shows the best treatment effect and the most differential metabolites regression. Targeted metabolomics shows that PS (3:1) can increase the content of AA, and reduce the content of PGF2-α by down-regulating the expression of enzymes Ptgs1 and Cbrl12 and up-regulating the expression of enzyme Hpgd.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Considering the increasing prevalence among young adults worldwide and the disabling phenotype of the disease, a deeper understanding of the complexity of the disease pathogenesis is needed to ultimately improve diagnosis and personalize treatment opportunities. Recent findings suggest that bioactive lipid mediators (LM) derived from ω-3/-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), also termed eicosanoids, may contribute to MS pathogenesis. For example, disturbances in LM profiles and especially those derived from the ω-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) have been reported in people with MS (PwMS), where they may contribute to the chronicity of neuroinflammatory processes. Moreover, we have previously shown that certain AA-derived LMs also associated with neurodegenerative processes in PwMS, suggesting that AA-derived LMs are involved in more pathological events than solely neuroinflammation. Yet, to date, a comprehensive overview of the contribution of these LMs to MS-associated pathological processes remains elusive. MAIN BODY: This review summarizes and critically evaluates the current body of literature on the eicosanoid biosynthetic pathway and its contribution to key pathological hallmarks of MS during different disease stages. Various parts of the eicosanoid pathway are highlighted, namely, the prostanoid, leukotriene, and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) biochemical routes that include specific enzymes of the cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases (LOX) families. In addition, cellular sources of LMs and their potential target cells based on receptor expression profiles will be discussed in the context of MS. Finally, we propose novel therapeutic approaches based on eicosanoid pathway and/or receptor modulation to ultimately target chronic neuroinflammation, demyelination and neurodegeneration in MS. SHORT CONCLUSION: The eicosanoid pathway is intrinsically linked to specific aspects of MS pathogenesis. Therefore, we propose that novel intervention strategies, with the aim of accurately modulating the eicosanoid pathway towards the biosynthesis of beneficial LMs, can potentially contribute to more patient- and MS subtype-specific treatment opportunities to combat MS.",

Serum fatty acid fractions and their associations with ICI treatment efficacy were also investigated. The results showed that long-term survivors (those who survived for ≥ 3 years) consumed significantly more seafood than short-term survivors (those who survived for < 3 years). Furthermore, the serum levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as well as the ratio of EPA to arachidonic acid (EPA/AA) were higher in the long-term survivors than those in the short-term survivors. The group with a high serum EPA/AA ratio had a significantly higher overall survival rate after ICI treatment than the group with a low serum EPA/AA ratio. In conclusion, higher dietary seafood consumption may improve OS in lung cancer patients treated with ICI and the serum EPA/AA ratio may be a useful biomarker for determining the efficacy of ICI treatment. Thus, supplements that increase the serum EPA/AA ratio could serve as new nutritional interventions for enhancing the efficacy of ICI treatment. However, further large-scale case and intervention studies are required.",

The incidence of diabetes, blood glucose, insulitis and cytokine profiles were monitored. At the end of the experiment, pancreatic tissues were stained by H&E. Serum cytokine profiles were examined using a Mesco Scale Discovery multiplexed-assay kit. RESULTS: Even though AA or AA plus DPP-4i treatment has no effect on incidence of diabetes and weight, AA treatment reduces blood glucose, preserves islet morphology and alleviates inflammatory cell infiltration into pancreatic islets in NOD mice, accompanying with increased serum levels of IL-10, IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-5, KC/GRO and TNF-α and decreased serum levels of IL-2. CONCLUSION: We observed that AA treatment alleviates autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice by reducing hyperglycemia, alleviating insulitis and improving cytokine profiles. DPP-4i might alleviate the effect of AA by cross-talk. We provide evidence of AA treatment to alleviate type 1 diabetes in NOD mice, which may provide a novel therapeutic option for type 1 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Inhibition of cholesterol de novo synthesis (DNS) by statins has controversial effects on the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High fatty acid conditions have been reported to limit the effect of statins on metabolism diseases. Whether high fatty acid conditions interfere with the effect of statins on HCC remains unclear. Here, we reported that inhibiting cholesterol DNS with atorvastatin promoted the oncogenic capabilities of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) in mice fed high fatty acid diets (HFD). The combined analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics revealed that arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism was the most significant changed pathway between mice with and without atorvastatin treatment. In vitro, in the presence of AA precursor linoleic acid (LA), atorvastatin promoted the proliferation and migration ability of HCC cell lines. However, in the absence of LA, these phenomena disappeared. TCGA and tissue microarray examination revealed that prostaglandin e synthase 2 (PTGES2), a key enzyme in AA metabolism, was associated with the poor outcome of HCC patients. Overexpression of PTGES2 promoted the proliferation and migration of HCC cell lines, and knockdown of PTGES2 inhibited the proliferation and migration of cells. Additionally, atorvastatin upregulated PTGES2 expression by enhancing Sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2)-mediated transcription. Knockdown of PTGES2 reversed the proliferation and migration ability enhanced by atorvastatin. Overall, our study reveals that a high fatty acid background is one of the possible conditions limiting the application of statins in HCC, under which statins promote the progression of HCC by enhancing SREBP2-mediated PTGES2 transcription.",

METHODS: Five groups of Sprague Dawley rats were used: normal, sham operated, PPD model, AUDA, and paroxetine hydrochloride. During the 21-day treatment period, animals in all groups underwent assessments (open field test, forced swimming test, and sucrose consumption) for depression-like behavior. At the conclusion of the treatment period, animals in all study groups were euthanized and various proteins in the prefrontal lobes were measured. RESULTS: Depression-like behavior in rats was attenuated by AUDA. In the prefrontal lobes of PPD rats, levels of 5-LOX, COX-2, sEH, IL-1β, IL- 6, p65, p-p65, P-IκBα, NF-κB p65, and GFAP were increased while levels of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and 5-HT were decreased. AUDA reversed these changes, thus having a similar effect as the classic antidepressant paroxetine hydrochloride. CONCLUSION: AUDA may constrain AA/NF-κB in the prefrontal cortex of PPD rats, thus inhibiting the inflammatory response and ultimately attenuating postpartum depression-like behavior.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is widely recognized as the primary etiological factor underlying low back pain, often necessitating surgical intervention as the sole recourse in severe cases. The metabolic pathway of arachidonic acid (AA), a pivotal regulator of inflammatory responses, influences the development and progression of IVDD. METHODS: Initially, a comparative analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between AA expression patterns and different stages of IVDD using single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Additionally, three machine learning methods (LASSO, random forest, and support vector machine recursive feature elimination) were employed to identify hub genes associated with IVDD. Subsequently, a novel artificial intelligence prediction model was developed for IVDD based on an artificial neural network algorithm and validated using an independent dataset. The identified hub genes were further subjected to functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and Connectivity Map analysis. Moreover, external validation was performed using flow cytometry and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Both scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data revealed a positive correlation between the severity of IVDD and the AA metabolic pathway. They also revealed increased AA metabolic activity in macrophages and neutrophils, as well as enhanced intercellular communication with nucleus pulposus cells. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, five hub genes (AKR1C3, ALOX5, CYP2B6, EPHX2, and PLB1) were identified, and an incipient diagnostic model was developed with an AUC of 0.961 in the training cohort and 0.72 in the validation cohort. An in-depth exploration of the functionality of these hub genes revealed their notable association with inflammatory responses and immune cell infiltration. Lastly, AH6809 was found to delay IVDD by inhibiting AKR1C3. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers comprehensive insights into potential biomarkers and small molecules associated with the early pathogenesis of IVDD. The identified biomarkers and the developed integrated diagnostic model hold great promise in predicting the onset of early IVDD. AH6809 was established as a therapeutic target for AKR1C3 in the treatment of IVDD, as evidenced by computer simulations and biological experiments.",

Compared to the control group, FCS caused significantly higher fat deposition, hepatic steatosis, liver and intestinal inflammatory damages (P<.05). FCS increased the abundance of Muribaculaceae in vivo and in vitro, which was positively correlated with the indices of metabolic disorders (P<.05). In vivo and in vitro data indicated that FCS enhanced the microbial function involved in pentose phosphate pathway and arachidonic acid metabolism, metabolomics further demonstrated that FCS led to an increase in prostaglandins (the catabolites of arachidonic acid) (P<.05).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oncogenic PIK3CA mutations (PIK3CAmut ) frequently occur in a higher proportion in luminal breast cancer (LBC), especially in refractory advanced cases, and are associated with changes in tumour cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, its effect on the progression of the immune microenvironment (TIME) within tumours and vital molecular events remains veiled. METHODS: Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) was used to describe the landscape of TIME in PIK3CAmut LBC. The PIK3CA mutant cell lines were established using CRISPER/Cas9 system. The gene expression levels, protein secretion and activity of signaling pathways were measured by real-time RT-PCR, ELISA, immunofluorescence staining or western blotting. GSEA analysis, transwell chemotaxis assay, live cell imaging, flow cytometry metabolite analysis targeting arachidonic acid, Dual-luciferase reporter assay, and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were used to investigate the underlying function and mechanism of the PI3K/5-LOX/LTB4 axis. RESULTS: PIK3CAmut LBC cells can induce an immunosuppressive TIME by recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and excluding cytotoxic T cells via the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism pathway. Mechanistically, PIK3CAmut activates the transcription of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in a STAT3-dependent manner, which in turn directly results in high LTB4 production, binding to BLT2 on MDSCs and promoting their infiltration. Since a suppressive TIME is a critical barrier for the success of cancer immunotherapy, the strategies that can convert \"cold\" tumours into \"hot\" tumours were compared. Targeted therapy against the PI3K/5-LOX/LTB4 axis synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy achieved dramatic shrinkage in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize that PIK3CAmut can induce immune evasion by recruiting MDSCs through the 5-LOX-dependent AA pathway, and combination targeted therapy with ICB may provide a promising treatment option for refractory advanced LBC patients.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant health concern and is the third most commonly diagnosed and second deadliest cancer worldwide. CRC has been steadily increasing in developing countries owing to factors such as aging and epidemics. Despite extensive research, the exact pathogenesis of CRC remains unclear, and its causes are complex and variable. Numerous in vitro, animal, and clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics such as Lactobacillus plantarum in reversing the adverse outcomes of CRC. These findings suggest that probiotics play vital roles in the prevention, adjuvant treatment, and prognosis of CRC. In this study, we constructed a mouse model of CRC using an intraperitoneal injection of azomethane combined with dextran sodium sulfate, while administering 5-fluorouracil as well as high- and low-doses of L. plantarum Zhang-LL live or heat-killed strains. Weight changes and disease activity indices were recorded during feeding, and the number of polyps and colon length were measured after euthanasia. HE staining was used to observe the histopathological changes in the colons of mice, and ELISA was used to detect the expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in serum. To investigate the specific mechanisms involved in alleviating CRC progression, gut microbial alterations were investigated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics, and changes in genes related to CRC were assessed using eukaryotic transcriptomics. The results showed that both viable and heat-killed strains of L. plantarum Zhang-LL in high doses significantly inhibited tumorigenesis, colon shortening, adverse inflammatory reactions, intestinal tissue damage, and pro-inflammatory factor expression upregulation. Specifically, in the gut microbiota, the abundance of the dominant flora Acutalibacter muris and Lactobacillus johnsonii was regulated, PGE2 expression was significantly reduced, the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway was inhibited, and CD22-mediated B-cell receptor regulation-related gene expression was upregulated. This study showed that L. plantarum Zhang-LL live or heat-inactivated strains alleviated CRC progression by reducing the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria, increasing the abundance of beneficial commensal bacteria, mediating the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, and improving host immunogenicity.",

We studied unsettled issues in the association between MDA-LDL and the pathophysiology of ASD in 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and eight age-matched controls. Social behaviors were assessed using the social responsiveness scale (SRS). To overcome the problem of using small samples, adaptive Lasso was used to enhance the interpretability accuracy, and a coefficient of variation was used for variable selections. Plasma levels of the MDA-LDL levels (91.00 ± 16.70 vs. 74.50 ± 18.88) and the DHA/arachidonic acid (ARA) ratio (0.57 ± 0.16 vs. 0.37 ± 0.07) were significantly higher and the superoxide dismutase levels were significantly lower in the ASD group than those in the control group. Total SRS scores in the ASD group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The unbeneficial DHA/ARA ratio induced ferroptosis via lipid peroxidation. Multiple linear regression analysis and adaptive Lasso revealed an association of the DHA/ARA ratio with total SRS scores and increased MDA-LDL levels in plasma, resulting in neuronal deficiencies.

The aim of this study was to assess if treatment with HSL at 2% improves renal function in MS through the metabolites of AA. A total of 24 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Group 1, control (C); Group 2, MS with 30% sucrose in drinking water, Group 3, MS plus HSL infusion at 2% (MS+HSL); and Group 4, C+HSL. We evaluated the perfusion pressure changes (∆-PP), the activities of cyclooxygenases (COXs), the percentage of AA, the expressions of PLA2, COX2, COX1, 5-LOX, TAXS and CYP450, and the concentrations of prostaglandins in the kidney from rats with MS. There was a decrease in the ∆-PP, in the activities of COXs, and the expressions of COX2 and CYP450 (p ≤ 0.03, respectively)as well asPGE2, TxB2, and LKB4 (p ≤ 0.01, respectively). However, the percentage of AA and expressions of PLA2 and PGE1 (p = 0.01, respectively) were increased in C and MS+HSL. The HSL treatment improved the function and anatomical structure of the kidneys in the MS rats, through antioxidant molecules, and inhibited the pathways that metabolize the AA including that of PLA2, COX2, 5-LOX, TAXS, and CYP450 while favoring the COX1 pathway. This improves the vascular resistance of renal arterioles.",

RESULTS: TFRD can effectively reduce chondrocyte apoptosis and cartilage degeneration in OA model rats. Serum metabolomics revealed that the intervention effect may be closely related to arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. Network pharmacologic prediction showed that COX-2 was the key target of TFRD in treating OA, and its mechanism might be related with NFκB, apoptosis, AMPK and arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. In vivo experiments indicated that TFRD can inhibit the abnormal expression of COX-2 mRNA in OA model rats. In the in vitro studies, the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein increased, AMPK phosphorylation was inhibited, and NFκB signaling pathway was activated in IL-1β-induced chondrocytes, and these changes can be reversed by TFRD. After the activation of AMPK signaling pathway or the block-down of NFκB signaling pathway, the effect of TFRD on COX-2 mRNA expression was significantly weakened. CONCLUSION: TFRD can inhibit COX-2-mediated arachidonic acid metabolites, and its mechanism is closely related to AMPK/NFκB pathway, which may be a key mechanism in the treatment of OA."

      "abstract": "Arachidonic acid (AA), an n-6 essential fatty acid, is a major component of mammalian cells and can be released by phospholipase A2. Accumulating evidence indicates that AA plays essential biochemical roles, as it is the direct precursor of bioactive lipid metabolites of eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acid obtained from three distinct enzymatic metabolic pathways: the cyclooxygenase pathway, lipoxygenase pathway, and cytochrome P450 pathway. AA metabolism is involved not only in cell differentiation, tissue development, and organ function but also in the progression of diseases, such as hepatic fibrosis, neurodegeneration, obesity, diabetes, and cancers. These eicosanoids are generally considered proinflammatory molecules, as they can trigger oxidative stress and stimulate the immune response. Therefore, interventions in AA metabolic pathways are effective ways to manage inflammatory-related diseases in the clinic. Currently, inhibitors targeting enzymes related to AA metabolic pathways are an important area of drug discovery. Moreover, many advances have also been made in clinical studies of AA metabolic inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Herein, we review the discovery of AA and focus on AA metabolism in relation to health and diseases. Furthermore, inhibitors targeting AA metabolism are summarized, and potential clinical applications are discussed."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent years have witnessed impressive growth in applying natural medicine in tumor treatment. Saffron is reported to elicit an inhibitory property against BC. Herein, we sought to explore the specific components and mechanistic basis of saffron's anti-breast carcinoma (BC) function. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis was employed to analyze saffron components' anti-BC activity and screen the corresponding target genes involved in BC. Then, the roles of the main saffron ingredient quercetin in the activity of BC cells were examined using CCK-8, MTS, flow cytometry, colony formation, Transwell, and Gelatin zymogram assays. Additionally, the interactions among Quercetin, EET, and Stat3 were assessed by immunofluorescence and Western blot, and LC-MS/MS determined the levels of AA, EETs, and CYP3A. Finally, BC xenograft mouse models were established to verify the anti-BC function of Quercetin in vivo. RESULTS: Quercetin, the main active component of saffron, inhibited BC progression. Quercetin suppressed BC cell growth, migration, and invasion and inhibited CYP3A4 expression and activity in BC. Mechanistically, Quercetin down-regulated CYP3A4 to block the nuclear translocation of Stat3 by decreasing the metabolization of AA to EETs, thereby alleviating BC. Moreover, exogenously added EETs counteracted the anti-tumor effect of Quercetin on BC. Quercetin also inhibited the tumor growth of tumor-bearing nude mice. CONCLUSION: Quercetin could inhibit the activity of CYP3A to down-regulate AA metabolites EETs, consequently hampering p-Stat3 and nuclear translocation, thus impeding BC development.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zhisou Powder (ZP), one of the most common prescriptions in traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely used in the treatment of acute or chronic bronchitis and chronic cough. The ZP was composed of Ziwan (Aster tataricus L. f.), Jiegeng (Platycodon grandiflorus (Jacq.) A. DC.), Jingjie (Nepeta cataria L.), Baibu (Stemona sessilifolia (Miq.) Miq.), Baiqian (Vincetoxicum glaucescens (Decne.) C. Y. Wu & D. Z. Li), Chenpi (Citrus × aurantium f. deliciosa (Ten.) M. Hiroe) and Gancao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC.), with plant names among it checked with MPNS (http://mpns.kew.org). But until now, the key active components and targets of ZP, and related mechanism of ZP in the treatment of chronic bronchitis (CB) remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study combined UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS, network pharmacology, metabonomics with experiment verification to explore potential mechanism of ZP in the treatment of CB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS was performed to analyze the chemical components of ZP. The potentially effective components, attractive targets and critical signaling pathways of Zhisou Powder in the treatment of CB were screened by UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS combined with network pharmacology. Additionally, the CB model rats induced by SO2 were used to evaluate the anti-chronic bronchitis activity of ZP in vivo. The pulmonary pathology was determined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Meanwhile, PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α/VEGFA signaling pathway predicted from network pharmacology was verified by Western blot and RT-PCR. Lastly, the metabolic changes of arachidonic acid (AA) in ZP-treated rats were quantitatively analyzed by LC-MS targeted metabonomics, and the proteins expression involved in AA metabolic pathway were detected by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blot. RESULTS: The main active components of ZP in the treatment of CB selected by network pharmacology and UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS technology were quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, galangin, isorhamnetin, naringenin, nobiletin, formononetin and so on. The core targets of these components were predicted to be TP53, TNF, IL-6, VEGFA, CASP3, IL-1β, JUN, PTGS2. Enrichment of KEGG pathway analysis found that PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α/VEGFA signaling pathway might play a key role in the treatment of CB with ZP. The in vivo study showed that ZP significantly improved the pathological changes of SO2-treated lung tissue and inhibited the activation of PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α/VEGFA signaling pathway. The changes of AA and its metabolites in vivo were studied by targeted metabonomics, and it showed that ZP could reprogram the disorder of AA metabolism which contributed to the treatment of CB with ZP. CONCLUSION: ZP displayed good therapeutic effect on CB model rats through inhibiting PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α/VEGFA signaling pathway to exhibit anti-inflammatory effect and reprogramming disordered metabolic pathway of arachidonic acid.",

      "abstract": "Linoleic acid (LA) is an essential omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) derived from the diet. Sebocytes, whose primary role is to moisturise the skin, process free fatty acids (FFAs) to produce the lipid-rich sebum. Importantly, like other sebum components such as palmitic acid (PA), LA and its derivative arachidonic acid (AA) are known to modulate sebocyte functions. Given the different roles of PA, LA and AA in skin biology, the aim of this study was to assess the specificity of sebocytes for LA and to dissect the different roles of LA and AA in regulating sebocyte functions. Using RNA sequencing, we confirmed that gene expression changes in LA-treated sebocytes were largely distinct from those induced by PA. LA, but not AA, regulated the expression of genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, androgen and nuclear receptor signalling, keratinisation, lipid homeostasis and differentiation. In contrast, a set of mostly down-regulated genes involved in lipid metabolism and immune functions overlapped in LA- and AA-treated sebocytes. Lipidomic analyses revealed that the changes in the lipid profile of LA-treated sebocytes were more pronounced than those of AA-treated sebocytes, suggesting that LA may serve not only as a precursor of AA but also as a potent regulator of sebaceous lipogenesis, which may not only influence the gene expression profile but also have further specific biological relevance. In conclusion, we have shown that sebocytes are able to respond selectively to different lipid stimuli and that LA-induced effects can be both AA-dependent and independent. Our findings allow for the consideration of LA application in the therapy of sebaceous gland-associated inflammatory skin diseases such as acne, where lipid modulation and selective targeting of AA metabolism are potential treatment options.",

The 7-week experiment was conducted on male Wistar rats receiving standard or high-fat diet (HFD) with intraperitoneal CBD injections for the last 14 days. The n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) activities and AA concentration in selected fractions were evaluated by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). The expression of proteins was determined by Western blot and the concentration of different parameters by ELISA, colorimetric, or multiplex assay kits. Our results revealed that CBD increased n-3 PUFAs activity in phospholipid and triacylglycerol fractions, and decreased AA content in the HFD group, especially in the phospholipid pool. Simultaneously, CBD decreased the expression of nuclear factor kappa B, cyclooxygenase-1, and - 2, resulting in the reduction of prostaglandin E2 and the increment of prostaglandin I2. CBD appears to be relatively safe for the treatment of obesity-induced heart disease, as it has anti-inflammatory and partially antioxidative properties.",

      "abstract": "Pharmaceuticals including antibiotics are among the hazardous micropollutants (HMP) of the environment. Incomplete degradation of the HMP leads to their persistence in water bodies causing a plethora of deleterious effects. Conventional wastewater treatment cannot remove HMP completely and a promising alternative comprises biotechnologies based on microalgae. The use of immobilized microalgae in environmental biotechnology is advantageous since immobilized cultures allow the recycling of the microalgal cells, support higher cell densities, and boost tolerance of microalgae to stresses including HMP. Here, we report on a comparative study of HMP (exemplified by the antibiotic ceftriaxone, CTA) removal by suspended and chitosan-immobilized cells of Lobosphaera sp. IPPAS C-2047 in flasks and in a column bioreactor. The removal of CTA added in the concentration of 20 mg/L was as high as 65% (in the flasks) or 85% (in the bioreactor). The adsorption on the carrier and abiotic oxidation were the main processes contributing 65-70% to the total CTA removal, while both suspended and immobilized cells took up 25-30% of CTA. Neither the immobilization nor CTA affected the accumulation of arachidonic acid (ARA) by Lobosphaera sp. during bioreactor tests but the subsequent nitrogen deprivation increased ARA accumulation 2.5 and 1.7 times in the suspended and chitosan-immobilized microalgae, respectively. The study of the Lobosphaera sp. microbiome revealed that the immobilization of chitosan rather than the CTA exposure was the main factor displacing the taxonomic composition of the microbiome. The possibility and limitations of the use of chitosan-immobilized Lobosphaera sp. IPPAS C-2047 for HMP removal coupled with the production of valuable long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is discussed.",

      "abstract": "An eight-week feeding trail was carried out to investigate the impacts of different dietary arachidonic acid (ARA) supplementations on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, tissue fatty acid profiles, and lipid metabolism of mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) juvenile. Six isonitrogenous (480 g kg-1 crude protein) and isolipidic (80 g kg-1 crude lipid) diets were formulated to contain 0.40, 2.50, 4.60, 8.90, 12.50, and 15.70 g ARA kg-1 (dry matter), respectively. Each experimental treatment included 24 mud crab juveniles (initial weight 11.29 ± 0.09 g) and was assigned to triplicate groups (n = 3). Crabs fed diets with 2.50, 4.60, and 8.90 g kg-1 ARA presented significantly higher percent weight gain (PWG) and specific growth rate (SGR) than those fed the other diets. Based on two-slope broken-line and quadratic curve regression analysis of PWG against dietary ARA levels, optimal dietary ARA levels were determined to be 5.20 g kg-1 and 6.20 g kg-1, respectively. Crabs fed with 4.60 g kg-1 ARA diet showed the lowest activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as well as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in hemolymph among all treatments. In hemolymph and hepatopancreas, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) as well as the contents of reduced glutathione (GSH) rose first and then dropped with the increase of dietary ARA levels, while the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) showed an opposite trend. Tissue fatty acid profiles reflected diets fatty acid compositions. The ARA contents in hepatopancreas and muscle significantly increased with the increase of dietary ARA levels. Furthermore, the areas of blasenzellen (B) cells and restzellen (R) cells were significantly downregulated with the increase of dietary ARA levels. Crabs fed with 0.40 g kg-1 ARA diet showed significantly higher gene expression levels of fatty acid synthase (fas) as well as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acc) among all treatments. Relative gene expression levels of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6pgd) as well as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) have been significantly upregulated in 0.40 and 2.50 g kg-1 ARA groups. Relative gene expression level of fatty acid binding protein 1 (fabp1) significantly increased in 4.60, 8.90, 12.50, and 15.70 g kg-1 ARA groups. However, the gene expression levels of fatty acid binding protein 4 (fabp4) as well as scavenger receptor class 2 (srb2) have not been influenced by dietary ARA levels. What is more, crabs fed diets with 4.60, 8.90, 12.50, and 15.70 g kg-1 ARA had a significantly higher expression level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (cpt1) than those fed diets with 0.40 and 2.50 g kg-1 ARA. In summary, optimum dietary ARA can promote growth, enhance antioxidant capacity, and improve health of mud crab juveniles. It also demonstrated that lipogenesis has been restrained with the increasing dietary ARA levels. These findings could provide theoretical guidance and reference for the lipid nutrition research as well as the development of the commercial diet in mud crab."

      "abstract": "Geometrical mono-trans isomers of arachidonic acid (mtAA) are endogenous products of free radical-induced cis-trans double bond isomerization occurring to natural fatty acids during cell metabolism, including lipid peroxidation (LPO). Very little is known about the functional roles of mtAA and in general on the effects of mono-trans isomers of polyunsaturated fatty acids (mtPUFA) in various types of programmed cell death, including ferroptosis. Using HT1080 and MEF cell cultures, supplemented with 20 μM PUFA (i.e., AA, EPA or DHA) and their mtPUFA congeners, ferroptosis occurred in the presence of RSL3 (a direct inhibitor of glutathione peroxidase 4) only with the PUFA in their natural cis configuration, whereas mtPUFA showed an anti-ferroptotic effect. By performing the fatty acid-based membrane lipidome analyses, substantial differences emerged in the membrane fatty acid remodeling of the two different cell fates. In particular, during ferroptosis mtPUFA formation and their incorporation, together with the enrichment of SFA, occurred. This opens new perspectives in the role of the membrane composition for a ferroptotic outcome. While pre-treatment with AA promoted cell death for treatment with H2O2 and RSL3, mtAA did not. Cell death by AA supplementation was suppressed also in the presence of either ferroptosis inhibitors, such as the lipophilic antioxidant ferrostatin-1, or NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitors, including diphenyleneiodonium chloride and apocynin. Our results confirm a more complex scenario for ferroptosis than actually believed. While LPO processes are active, the importance of environmental lipid levels, balance among SFA, MUFA and PUFA in lipid pools and formation of mtPUFA influence the membrane phospholipid turnover, with crucial effects in the occurrence of cell death by ferroptosis.",

      "abstract": "Drug resistance is a major obstacle in cancer treatment and recurrence prevention and leads to poor outcomes in patients suffering from osteosarcoma. Clarification of the mechanism of drug resistance and exploration of effective strategies to overcome this obstacle could lead to clinical benefits for these patients. The expression of far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FUBP1) was found to be markedly elevated in osteosarcoma cell lines and clinical specimens compared with osteoblast cells and normal bone specimens. High expression of FUBP1 was correlated with a more aggressive phenotype and a poor prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. We found that overexpression of FUBP1 confers lobaplatin resistance, whereas the inhibition of FUBP1 sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to lobaplatin-induced cytotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq and RNA-seq were performed to explore the potential mechanism. It was revealed that FUBP1 could regulate the transcription of prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) and subsequently activate the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway, which leads to resistance to lobaplatin. Our investigation provides evidence that FUBP1 is a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma patients. Targeting FUBP1, its downstream target PTGES and the AA metabolic pathway may be promising strategies for sensitizing chemoresistant osteosarcoma cells to lobaplatin."

Human seminal fluid contains different prostaglandins: PGE (PGE1 and PGE2), PGF2α, and their specific 19-hydroxy derivatives, 18,19-dehydro derivatives of PGE1 and PGE2. The objective of this study is to synthesize the available literature of in vivo animal studies and human clinical trials on the association between the AA pathway and male fertility. PGE is significantly decreased in the semen of infertile men, suggesting the potential for exploitation of PGE agonists to improve male fertility. Indeed, ibuprofen can affect male fertility by promoting alterations in sperm function and standard semen parameters. The results showed that targeting the AA pathways could be an attractive strategy for the treatment of male fertility.",

      "abstract": "Immunotherapy is currently the most promising treatment strategy for long-term tumor regression. However, current cancer immunotherapy shows low response rates due to insufficient immunogenicity of tumor cells. Herein, we report a strategy to keep tumor cells highly immunogenic by triggering cascade immunogenic tumor ferroptosis. We developed a six-enzyme co-expressed nanoplatform: lipoxygenase (LOX) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-co-loaded FeCo/Fe-Co dual-metal atom nanozyme (FeCo/Fe-Co DAzyme/PL), which can not only induce initial immunogenic tumor ferroptosis through its own multi-enzyme mimetic activities but also up-regulate arachidonic acid (AA) expression to synergize with CD8+ T cell-derived IFN-γ to induce ACSL4-mediated immunogenic tumor ferroptosis. During this process, FeCo/Fe-Co DAzyme/PL can induce lipid peroxidation (LPO) by efficiently generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depleting GSH and GPX4 at tumor sites. Additionally, free AA released from PLA2 catalysis is converted into arachidonyl-CoA under the activation of ACSL4 stimulated by IFN-γ, which is further incorporated into phospholipids on membranes and peroxidized with the participation of LOX. Consequently, FeCo/Fe-Co DAzyme/PL can promote irreversible cascade immunogenic ferroptosis through multiple ROS storms, GSH/GPX4 depletion, LOX catalysis, and IFN-γ-mediated ACSL4 activation, constructing an effective pathway to overcome the drawbacks of current immunotherapy.",

Based on our previous study, we speculated that EPA might be associated with the development of healed plaques and might limit thrombus size. This study aimed to elucidate the association between EPA and arachidonic acid (AA) ratios and various plaque characteristics in patients with plaque rupture. METHODS: A total of 95 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) caused by plaque rupture who did not take lipid-lowering drugs and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention using optical coherence tomography (OCT) were included. Clinical characteristics, lipid profiles, and OCT findings were compared between patients with lower and higher EPA/AA ratios (0.41) according to the levels in the Japanese general population. RESULTS: In the high EPA/AA (n=29, 30.5%) and low EPA/AA (n=66, 69.5 %) groups, the high EPA/AA group was significantly older (76.1 vs. 66.1 years, P＜0.01) and had lower peak creatine kinase (556 vs. 1651 U/L, P=0.03) than those with low EPA/AA. Similarly, patients with high EPA/AA had higher prevalence of layered and calcified plaque (75.9 vs. 39.4 %, P＜0.01; 79.3 vs. 50.0 %, P＜0.01, respectively) than low EPA/AA group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a high EPA/AA ratio was an independent factor in determining the development of layered and calcified plaques. CONCLUSION: A high EPA/AA ratio may be associated with the development of layered and calcified plaques in patients with plaque rupture.",

PUFAs have been reported to be insufficient in schizophrenia, and the resulting cell membrane impairments have been hypothesized as an etiological mechanism. However, the impact of PUFA deficiencies on the onset of schizophrenia remain uncertain. We investigated the associations between PUFAs consumption and schizophrenia incidence rates through correlational analyses and conducted Mendelian randomization analyses to reveal the causal effects. Using dietary PUFA consumption and national schizophrenia incidence rates in 24 countries, we found that incidence rates of schizophrenia were inversely correlated with arachidonic acid (AA) and ω-6 LCPUFA consumption (rAA = -0.577, p < 0.01; rω-6 LCPUFA = -0.626, p < 0.001). Moreover, Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that genetically predicted AA and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) were protective factors against schizophrenia (ORAA = 0.986, ORGLA = 0.148). In addition, no significant relationships were observed between schizophrenia and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or other ω-3 PUFAs. These findings show that the deficiencies of ω-6 LCPUFAs, especially AA, are associated with schizophrenia risk, which sheds novel insight into the etiology of schizophrenia and a promising diet supplementation for the prevention and treatment of schizophrenia.",

Hepatocellular, lung, and breast carcinoma and normal hepatocytes cell lines were exposed to 0 or 50 μM ARA for 30 min and then assessed for proliferative capacity, surface membrane-associated sphingomyelin (SM) content, neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) activity, beta 2 microglobulin (β2 m) expression, and ceramide (Cer) levels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and caspase 3/7 activity were evaluated. Exposure to ARA for 30 min led to impairment of the tumor cells' proliferative capacity and revealed that the different cell lines display remarkably similar surface membrane SM content but diverse responses to ARA treatment. Arachidonic acid tumoricidal impact was shown to be associated with nSMase activation, exposure of cell surface membrane β2 m to antibody binding, and hydrolysis of SM to Cer, which accumulated on the cell surface and in the cytosol. The ARA and Cer-mediated inhibition of tumor cell viability appeared to be independent of ROS generation or caspase 3/7 activation. The data were compared and contrasted to findings reported in the literature on ARA tumoricidal mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive gliomas. New and more effective therapeutic approaches are being sought based on studies of the various mechanisms of GBM tumorigenesis, including the synthesis and metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA), an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). PubMed, GEPIA, and the transcriptomics analysis carried out by Seifert et al. were used in writing this paper. In this paper, we discuss in detail the biosynthesis of this acid in GBM tumors, with a special focus on certain enzymes: fatty acid desaturase (FADS)1, FADS2, and elongation of long-chain fatty acids family member 5 (ELOVL5). We also discuss ARA metabolism, particularly its release from cell membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 (cPLA2, iPLA2, and sPLA2) and its processing by cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), lipoxygenases (5-LOX, 12-LOX, 15-LOX-1, and 15-LOX-2), and cytochrome P450. Next, we discuss the significance of lipid mediators synthesized from ARA in GBM cancer processes, including prostaglandins (PGE2, PGD2, and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2)), thromboxane A2 (TxA2), oxo-eicosatetraenoic acids, leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4), lipoxins, and many others. These lipid mediators can increase the proliferation of GBM cancer cells, cause angiogenesis, inhibit the anti-tumor response of the immune system, and be responsible for resistance to treatment."

The present study aimed to evaluate the role of the KD in reducing oxidative stress (OS) by increasing the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and Arachidonic acid (ARA), an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid, as a possible mechanism in relieving seizure attacks in children with DRE. Forty children with refractory epilepsy were included in the present study. The serum levels of BHB, ARA, and OS markers, malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-hydroxyl-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), were evaluated in children with DRE and compared before and after the three months of KD therapy. Thirty-four of 40 included children could complete the three-month KD therapy. Twenty-one (61.76%) patients had more than a 50% reduction in seizure frequency after the KD (responders). The remaining 13 children were considered non-responders to the diet. The serum levels of ARA and BHB significantly (p < 0.05) increased after the KD therapy. The serum levels of OS parameters MDA and 8-OHdG before the diet therapy were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those after the administration. The serum levels of BHB and MDA after the KD therapy in the responders were respectively higher and lower than those in the non-responders (p < 0.001). Ketogenic diet might reduce brain OS by increasing BHB and ARA. The role of BHB in diminishing OS and seizure might be more remarkable than ARA.",

      "abstract": "Oxylipins derived from the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways of the arachidonic acid (ARA) cascade are essential for the regulation of the inflammatory response and many other physiological functions. Comprehensive analytical methods comprised of oxylipin and protein abundance analysis are required to fully understand mechanisms leading to changes within these pathways. Here, we describe the development of a quantitative multi-omics approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based targeted oxylipin metabolomics and proteomics. As the first targeted proteomics method to cover these pathways, it enables the quantitative analysis of all human COX (COX-1 and COX-2) and relevant LOX pathway enzymes (5-LOX, 12-LOX, 15-LOX, 15-LOX-2, and FLAP) in parallel to the analysis of 239 oxylipins with our targeted oxylipin metabolomics method from a single sample. The detailed comparison between MRM3 and classical MRM-based detection in proteomics showed increased selectivity for MRM3, while MRM performed better in terms of sensitivity (LLOQ, 16-122 pM vs. 75-840 pM for the same peptides), linear range (up to 1.5-7.4 μM vs. 4-368 nM), and multiplexing capacities. Thus, the MRM mode was more favorable for this pathway analysis. With this sensitive multi-omics approach, we comprehensively characterized oxylipin and protein patterns in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 and differently polarized primary macrophages. Finally, the quantification of changes in protein and oxylipin levels induced by lipopolysaccharide stimulation and pharmaceutical treatment demonstrates its usefulness to study molecular modes of action involved in the modulation of the ARA cascade.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cellular inflammatory response, mediated by arachidonic acid (AA) and cyclooxygenase, is a highly regulated process that leads to the repair of damaged tissue. Recent studies on murine C2C12 cells have demonstrated that AA supplementation leads to myotube hypertrophy. However, AA has not been tested on primary human muscle cells. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether AA supplementation has similar effects on human muscle cells. METHODS: Proliferating and differentiating human myoblasts were exposed to AA in a dose-dependent manner (50-0.80 µM) for 48 (myoblasts) or 72 (myotubes) hours. Cell viability was tested using a 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay and cell counting; myotube area was determined by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy; and anabolic signaling pathways were evaluated by western blot and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Our data show that the treatment of primary human myoblasts treated with 50 µM and 25 µM of AA led to the release of PGE2 and PGF2α at levels higher than those of control-treated cells (p < 0.001 for all concentrations). Additionally, 50 µM and 25 µM of AA suppressed myoblast proliferation, myotube area, and myotube fusion. Anabolic signaling indicated reductions in total and phosphorylated TSC2, AKT, S6, and 4EBP1 in myoblasts at 50 µM of AA (p < 0.01 for all), but not in myotubes. These changes were not affected by COX-2 inhibition with celecoxib. CONCLUSION: Together, our data demonstrate that high concentrations of AA inhibit myoblast proliferation, myotube fusion, and myotube hypertrophy, thus revealing potential deleterious effects of AA on human skeletal muscle cell health and viability.",

Similarly, Ascophylum nodosum extract (ANE) from the brown seaweed A. nodosum, a plant biostimulant that contains AA, can also prime plants for defense against pathogen challenges. A previous parallel study comparing the transcriptomes of AA- and ANE-root-treated tomatoes demonstrated significant overlap in transcriptional profiles, a shared induced resistance phenotype, and changes in the accumulation of various defense-related phytohormones. In this work, untargeted metabolomic analysis via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was conducted to investigate the local and systemic metabolome-wide remodeling events elicited by AA and ANE root treatment in tomatoes. Our study demonstrated AA and ANE's capacity to locally and systemically alter the metabolome of tomatoes with enrichment of chemical classes and accumulation of metabolites associated with defense-related secondary metabolism. AA- and ANE-root-treated plants showed enrichment of fatty acyl-glycosides and strong modulation of hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives. Identification of specific metabolites whose accumulation was affected by AA and ANE treatment revealed shared metabolic changes related to ligno-suberin biosynthesis and the synthesis of phenolic compounds. This study highlights the extensive local and systemic metabolic changes in tomatoes induced by treatment with a fatty acid MAMP and a seaweed-derived plant biostimulant with implications for induced resistance and crop improvement.",

During CH, the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA), which is present in the cell membrane phospholipids, is modulated. Metabolism of AA gives rise to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) via cytochrome P450 (CYP) ω-hydroxylases and CYP epoxygenases, respectively. A plethora of studies demonstrated the involvement of CYP-mediated AA metabolites in the pathogenesis of CH. Also, inflammation is known to be a characteristic hallmark of CH. In this review, our aim is to highlight the impact of inflammation on CYP-derived AA metabolites and CH. Inflammation is shown to modulate the expression of various CYP ω-hydroxylases and CYP epoxygenases and their respective metabolites in the heart. In general, HETEs such as 20-HETE and mid-chain HETEs are pro-inflammatory, while EETs are characterized by their anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties. Several mechanisms are implicated in inflammation-induced CH, including the modulation of NF-κB and MAPK. This review demonstrated the inflammatory modulation of cardiac CYPs and their metabolites in the context of CH and the anti-inflammatory strategies that can be employed in the treatment of CH and HF.",
