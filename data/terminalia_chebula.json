      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gout is a metabolic disorder accompanied by high serum uric acid levels and joint inflammation due to disturbances in purine metabolism in the body. The dried fruit of Terminalia chebula Retz. is recorded in the \"Four Medical Tantras\" for the treatment of gout and the core anti-gout component of the Tibetan clinical prescription, such as TongFengTangSan. However, the anti-gout efficacy has not been reported yet. AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the anti-gout effect and mechanisms of Terminalia chebula Retz. in gout model rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the components of the Terminalia chebula Retz. extract were detected and characterized using ultra performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry technology. A gout model was established using the continuous intragastric administration of 200 mg/kg of potassium oxonate and 300 mg/kg of hypoxanthine for 44 days, and 8 mg monosodium urate suspension was injected once in the joint cavity on the 42nd day. One hour after modeling, Terminalia chebula Retz. extract was administered by gavage at low, medium, and high doses. The corresponding biochemical indicators at the protein and gene levels were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot. RESULTS: A total of 149 compounds, comprising 23 phenolic acids, 104 tannins, 5 flavonoids, 14 terpenoids, and three other compounds, were identified in Terminalia chebula Retz. extract using the ultra performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method. The in vivo pharmacodynamics experiments showed that Terminalia chebula Retz. extract significantly reduced the serum uric acid level, the ankle swelling level, and the level of inflammatory factors in the gout rats. Terminalia chebula Retz. extract also decreased the serum xanthine oxidase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and diamine oxidase activity of the gout rats. The western blot and PCR experiments showed that treatment with Terminalia chebula Retz. extract down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of urate transporter 1 and glucose transporter 9 in the kidney tissues. An immunofluorescence experiment revealed that Terminalia chebula Retz. extract strengthened the intestinal barrier by the up-regulation on the protein expression of occludin and zonula occludens-1 in the ileum. In addition, Terminalia chebula Retz. extract was found to alleviate inflammation by inactivating the renal NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and the synovial membranes of joints. Terminalia chebula Retz. treatment down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NLRP3 inflammasome family members, including toll-like receptor 4, toll-like receptor 2, NLRP3, nuclear factor kappa-B, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD and interleukin-1β. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that Terminalia chebula Retz. extract alleviated gout symptoms through the dual effects of lowering UA and relieving inflammation through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation."

(T. chebula) has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and tyrosinase enzyme inhibitory activities. So, the present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of T. chebula 5% cream compared to hydroquinone 2% cream in treating patients with melasma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The formulation of T. chebula 5% cream was prepared. The stability and release study of the cream were performed. In this randomized, controlled, triple-blind clinical trial, participants with facial melasma were randomly assigned to receive T. chebula 5% cream or hydroquinone 2% cream at bedtime for 12 weeks. Modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI) scores were recorded for all the participants at the baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after initiating the study. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences regarding mMASI scores were detected between T. chebula and hydroquinone groups at each time point. The reduction in mMASI scores was statistically significant (p<0.05) in T. chebula group 4, 8, and 12 weeks after initiating the study. However, it reached statistical significance (p<0.05) in hydroquinone group 8, and 12 weeks after the study initiation. The frequencies of side effects especially skin irritation were significantly (p<0.05) lower in T. chebula group. CONCLUSION: T. chebula 5% cream could be as effective as hydroquinone 2% cream in treating melasma with fewer side effects."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Terminalia chebula (TC) on Tibetan yak-origin Salmonella-induced diarrhea and dysentery in mice. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), and the oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), reduced glutathione (GSH-PX), and catalase (CAT) in the serum of mice were measured using ELISA kits. Using microbial diversity sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics detection techniques, the relevant mechanisms of TC treatment in a mouse Salmonella infection model were evaluated. The results showed the following: TC can effectively reduce the diarrhea rate; alleviate weight loss caused by Salmonella invasion; reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in serum; and increase the concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. TC can improve the body's antioxidant levels to heal the damage caused by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. The histological section results show that TC can significantly improve gastric and intestinal tissue lesions and has no toxic effects on the liver and kidneys. 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing analysis suggests that Lactobacillus, Enterorhabdus, Alistipes (bacterial community), Lodderomyces, Saccharomyces, and Penicillium (fungal community) may be key functional microbial communities in TC. Non-targeted metabolomics also suggests that the antibacterial treatment of dysentery with chebulic acid may be related to regulation of the Ras signaling pathway, long-term potentiation, the MAPK signaling pathway, metabolic pathways, and gut microbiome composition. Conclusion: TC has clear clinical efficacy in treating bacterial diarrhea, presenting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Its roles in regulating the gut microbiome and metabolic pathways and products were determined as the main reason for its therapeutic effect in a mouse gastroenteritis model caused by Salmonella infection."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMALOGICAL RELEVANCE: Terminalia chebula, known for its extensive use in traditional medicinal practices among indigenous cultures, is recognized for its effectiveness in treating various oral disorders. Healers in India and China utilize the ripe fruits of T. chebula to prevent and manage conditions such as dental cavities, gingivitis, bleeding gums and stomatitis. The fruits have also been traditionally used in Ayurvedic and Siddha medicines for treatment of various diseases including anticancer properties. It is also an important component of Tibetan traditional medicine used for the treatment of cancer. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of T. chebula against lung and colon carcinoma. AIM OF THE STUDY: Despite its historical significance in oral health, the potential of T. chebula against oral cancer has not been explored, warranting further investigation into its bioactive properties. This study aims to explore the therapeutic potential of the hydroalcoholic extract of Terminalia chebula fruits and its fractions against oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) using SCC9 cells focusing on their cytotoxicity, anti-proliferative effect and the synergistic action of its ethyl-acetate fraction with cisplatin (CP). Additionally it seeks to identify the bioactive phytoconstituents in EAF were identified using LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antioxidant activity of TYH and its fraction were assessed using DPPH and ABTS assays. Total phenolic (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were quantified via Folin-ciocalteau and alluminium chloride assays respectively. Cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects were assessed using MTT assay, clonogenic assay and cell migration assay. Apoptosis in EAF treated SCC9 cells was analysed by using DAPI, Giemsa staining and flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed using H2DCFDA, western blotting examined expression of apoptosis related proteins in SCC9 cells. Combinational effect of EAF with cisplatin (CP) was also assessed and phytochemical constituents of EAF were analysed using LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. RESULTS: The ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) showed the highest antioxidant activity (IC50 value of 8.16 ± 0.59 μg/mL and 4.99 ± 0.82 μg/mL in DPPH and ABTS assays respectively) which reciprocated with a high TPC and TFC (528.46 ± 2.59 mgGAE/g and 49.10 ± 1.61 mgQE/g dry weight of the extract respectively) content. EAF significantly reduced cell viability with an IC50 value of 86.73 ± 0.55 μg/mL, resulted in dose dependent cell death, and prevented the proliferation and migration in SCC9 cells. Further Annexin V-PI based flow cytometric analysis and caspase-3/7 enzyme activity assay confirmed the apoptotic effect of EAF in SCC9 cells. Intrinsic pathway of apoptosis post treatment with EAF was confirmed by western blotting with marker proteins, Bax, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, cleaved caspase, procaspase and PARP. A combinatorial study of EAF with the standard drug cisplatin also indicated a synergistic effect of the fraction in cisplatin treated cells with a CI value of 0.67571. LC-ESI-QTOF-MS led to identification of the presence of phenolics and gallotannins with anticancer properties in EAF. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential of the hydroalcoholic extract of Terminalia chebula fruits (TYH), especially its ethyl acetate fraction (EAF), as a therapeutic agent against oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia (HUA), a common metabolic disorder associated with gout, renal dysfunction, and systemic inflammation, necessitates safer and more comprehensive therapeutic approaches. Traditional Tibetan medicine has a rich history of treating HUA. This study aimed to identify novel anti-hyperuricemic herb derived from traditional Tibetan medicine. METHODS: Traditional Tibetan medicine prescriptions for HUA were analyzed using data mining techniques, identifying T. chebula as a high-frequency herb. Its phytochemical composition was characterized by UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS. Hyperuricemic rat models were treated with T. chebula to assess its effects on serum uric acid (UA) levels, renal inflammation, intestinal barrier integrity, and gut microbiota composition. Molecular and histological analyses evaluated its impact on key biomarkers. RESULTS: Through data mining, we identified T. chebula as a promising candidate for HUA treatment. T. chebula demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of xanthine oxidase (XOD) in vitro and significantly reduced serum UA levels and XOD activity in vivo. It restored gut barrier function by upregulating tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-1) and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α). T. chebula improved renal function, reducing serum creatinine (Cre) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Gut microbiota analysis revealed a favorable shift in microbial composition, with reductions in harmful bacteria (eg, Clostridium spp.) and increases in beneficial bacteria (eg, Roseburia). These effects aligned with the modulation of the gut-kidney axis. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the multi-target therapeutic potential of T. chebula in HUA management. By regulating the gut-kidney axis, T. chebula alleviates systemic inflammation, enhances intestinal and renal health, and addresses critical aspects of HUA pathology. These findings underscore the value of integrating traditional medicine with modern scientific methodologies to develop innovative treatments."

Its medicinal value is gradually being recognized and shows great potential in the improvement of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) disorders. Tibetan medicine theory classifies this type of disease as one of the \"Jie Xie Syndrome (བརྗེད་བྱེད།).\" The role of T. Chebula in such diseases has been increasingly studied. This work aimed to elucidate the research progress of T. Chebula in alleviating MCI. The review offers a critical update on the current understanding of the effect of T. Chebula on MCI and highlights new opportunities for exploring its therapeutic potential. This review discusses the role of T. Chebula in alleviating MCI and provides a comprehensive overview of the traditional medicinal uses, chemical composition, toxicology, and quality control aspects of T. Chebula. This review covers 171 chemical constituents and 11 active constituents targeting MCI, such as flavonoids, which can alleviate MCI, primarily through its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. T. Chebula shows potential as a natural medicine for the treatment and prevention of MCI. As an important part of ethnomedicinal resources, this work offers valuable insights for future research on T. Chebula-containing ethnomedicines. Research on traditional drug treatments, optimized treatment standards, improved societal knowledge about MCI, and development of an early detection system is essential to the diagnosis and treatment of MCI. These efforts will provide better treatment resources for patients with MCI."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Terminalia chebula is a classical medicine for the treatment of lingering dysentery, and both raw and processed T. chebula can alleviate ulcerative colitis (UC). The therapeutic efficacy of T. chebula is enhanced after processing, but the mechanism that processing improves this efficacy is still unknown. We investigated the medicinal effects of raw and processed T. chebula on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC model rats using intestinal flora and metabolomics analyses, in order to elucidate the mechanism by which processing enhances the therapeutic effect. METHODS: The major constituents of raw and processed T. chebula were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). UC model was replicated using the DSS method, and then UC rats were administered raw and processed T. chebula. The general physical signs, disease activity index (DAI) scores, colon histopathological morphology, and the expressions of inflammatory cytokines were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of T. chebula. In addition, 16 s rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to characterize the intestinal flora and contents of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was utilized to identify the nontargeted fecal metabolites. RESULTS: Raw and processed T. chebula significantly improved the general physical signs and colon inflammatory symptoms and decreased DAI scores of UC rats. Both raw and processed T. chebula mitigated intestinal flora disorders in UC rats, increasing probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Romboutsia. However, the effect of processed T. chebula was more pronounced. Moreover, the levels of SCFAs of DSS-induced UC rats were restored after drug administration, and the processed T. chebula had a better regulatory effect than raw T. chebula. In the fecal nontargeted metabolomics analysis, differential metabolites such as lipids and amino acids were identified. The processed T. chebula can regulate purine metabolism and other pathways to improve UC, and the levels of the disordered metabolites gradually approached those of the control group. CONCLUSION: Raw and processed T. chebula had the capacity to mitigate DSS-induced UC by rebalancing the intestinal flora, restoring the contents of SCFAs, and regulating fecal metabolites, while processed T. chebula showed preferable effects.",

Methods SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: a control group, a CIA group, a TCWE group and a methotrexate (MTX) group, with 15 rats in each group. Except for the control group, SD rats in other groups were subcutaneously injected with type II collagen to establish the model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The rats in the TCWE group were treated with 20 mg/(kg.d) TCWE and the rats in the MTX group were treated with 1.67 mg/(kg.d) MTX. After 14 days of treatment, the cartilage morphology was examined using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and splenic T lymphocyte apoptosis and Treg/Th17 cell ratio were detected by flow cytometry. The mRNA expressions of retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor γt (RORγt), forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), PD-1 and PD-L1 in spleen were detected by reverse transcription PCR. The expression and localization of RORγt and FOXP3 were detected by immunohistochemical staining. The protein expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1 in splenic lymphocytes were detected by Western blot, and the levels of serum interleukin 17 (IL-17) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in rats were detected by ELISA. Results Compared with CIA group, the pathological changes of cartilage and synovium were significantly alleviated in the TCWE group and the MTX group. Both the apoptosis rate of T lymphocytes in spleen and the ratio of Treg/Th17 cells increased. The expression of RORγt decreased, while the expressions of FOXP3, PD-1 and PD-L1 increased in spleen lymphocytes. The level of serum IL-17 decreased, while the level of serum TGF-β increased. Conclusion TCWE treatment may activate PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in spleen cells to regulate cellular immunity, thus reducing cartilage injury in CIA rats.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of botanical medicine has been demonstrated as a potential strategy to manage or treat a variety of health issues. Terminalia chebula (Retz) fruit and Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal roots are important medicinal herbs described in Ayurveda and traditional therapy for diverse health benefits. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the immune function-enhancing potential of a unique blend of T. chebula fruit and W. somnifera root extracts, LN20189, in healthy men and women. METHODS: Forty healthy volunteers (age: 35-60 years) were randomized into two groups receiving either LN20189 (500 mg per day) or a matched placebo over 28 consecutive days. The total T-cell population was the primary efficacy measure in this study. The secondary efficacy measures included counts of CD4, CD8, natural killer (NK) cells, serum levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), total immunoglobulin-G (IgG), and Immune Function Questionnaire (IFQ) scores. Safety parameter assessments were also conducted. RESULTS: Post-trial, in LN20189-supplemented subjects, T cells, CD4, NK cells count, and the CD4:CD8 ratio were increased by 9.32, 10.10, 19.91, and 17.43%, respectively, as compared to baseline. LN20189 supplementation increased serum IFN-γ and IgG levels by 14.57 and 27.09% from baseline and by 13.98 and 21.99%, compared to placebo, respectively. Also, the IFQ scores in the LN20189 group were 84.68% (vs. baseline) and 69.44% (vs. placebo) lower at the end of the trial. LN20189 improved the study volunteers' cellular and humoral immune functions. CONCLUSION: In summary, LN20189 supplementation was found tolerable and improved the key cellular and humoral factors of the immune system and helped improve immune function of the trial volunteers."

      "abstract": "Chronic restraint stress induces cognitive abnormalities through changes in synapses and oxidant levels in the amygdala and hippocampus. Given the neuroprotective effects of fruit of Terminalia chebula (Halileh) in different experimental models, the present investigation aimed to address whether Terminalia chebula is able to reduce chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral, synaptic and oxidant markers in the rat model. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups as follows: control (did not receive any treatment and were not exposed to stress), stress (restraint stress for 2 h a day for 14 consecutive days), Terminalia chebula (received 200 mg/kg hydroalcoholic extract of Terminalia chebula), and stress + Terminalia chebula groups (received 200 mg/kg extract of Terminalia chebula twenty minutes before stress) (n = 8 in each group). We used the shuttle box test to assess learning and memory, Golgi-Cox staining to examine dendritic spine density in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus and the basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS) in the brain. The shuttle box test results demonstrated that Terminalia chebula treatment had a profound positive effect on memory parameters, including step-through latency (STL) and time spent in the dark room, when compared to the stress group. Daily oral treatment with Terminalia chebula effectively suppressed the loss of neural spine density in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus and the basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala caused by chronic restraint stress, as demonstrated by Golgi-Cox staining. Additionally, the results indicate that Terminalia chebula significantly reduced the TOS and increased TAC in the brain compared to the stress group. In conclusion, our results suggest that Terminalia chebula improved memory impairment and synaptic loss in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala induced by restraint stress via inhibiting oxidative damage.",

      "abstract": "Terminalia chebula extract (TCE) has many physiological functions and is potentially helpful in maintaining poultry health, but its specific effect on the growth of broilers is not yet known. This research investigated the effects of dietary Terminalia chebula extract (TCE) supplementation on growth performance, immune function, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal health in yellow-feathered broilers. A total of 288 one-day-old yellow-feathered broilers were divided into four treatment groups (72 broilers/group), each with six replicates of 12 broilers. The broilers were given a basal diet of corn-soybean meal supplemented with 0 (control), 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg TCE for 56 d. The results demonstrated that, compared with the basal diet, the addition of TCE significantly increased (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05) the final body weight and overall weight gain and performance and decreased (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05) the feed-to-gain ratio in the overall period. Dietary TCE increased (linear, p < 0.05) the levels of IgM, IL-4, and IL-10 and decreased (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05) the level of IL-6 in the serum. Dietary TCE increased (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05) the levels of IL-2 and IL-4, decreased (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05) the level of IL-1β, and decreased (linear, p < 0.05) the level of IL-6 in the liver. Dietary TCE increased (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05) the level of IgM and IL-10, increased (linear, p < 0.05) the level of IgG, and decreased (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05) the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in the spleen. Supplementation with TCE linearly and quadratically increased (p < 0.05) the catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity activities while decreasing (p < 0.05) the malonic dialdehyde concentrations in the serum, liver, and spleen. TCE-containing diets for broilers resulted in a higher (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05) villus height, a higher (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05) ratio of villus height to crypt depth, and a lower (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05) crypt depth compared with the basal diet. TCE significantly increased (linear, p < 0.05) the acetic and butyric acid concentrations and decreased (quadratic, p < 0.05) the isovaleric acid concentration. Bacteroidaceae and Bacteroides, which regulate the richness and diversity of microorganisms, were more abundant and contained when TCE was added to the diet. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that supplementing broilers with TCE could boost their immune function, antioxidant capacity, and gut health, improving their growth performance; they could also provide a reference for future research on TCE."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN) is a renal injury caused by hyperuricemia and is the main cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. ShiWeiHeZiSan, which is composed mainly of components of Terminalia chebula Retz. And is recorded in the Four Medical Tantras, is a typical traditional Tibetan medicinal formula for renal diseases. Although T. chebula has been reported to improve renal dysfunction and reduce renal cell apoptosis, the specific mechanism of the nephroprotective effects of T. chebula on HN is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to evaluate the effects and specific mechanism of T. chebula extract on HN through network pharmacology and in vivo and in vitro experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potassium oxalate (1.5 g/kg) and adenine (50 mg/kg) were combined for oral administration to establish the HN rat model, and the effects of T. chebula extract on rats in the HN model were evaluated by renal function indices and histopathological examinations. UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS analysis was also conducted to investigate the chemical components of T. chebula extract, and the potential therapeutic targets of T. chebula in HN were predicted by network pharmacology analysis. Moreover, the activation of potential pathways and the expression of related mRNAs and proteins were further observed in HN model rats and uric acid-treated HK-2 cells. RESULTS: T. chebula treatment significantly decreased the serum uric acid (SUA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) levels in HN rats and ameliorated renal pathological injury and fibrosis. A total of 25 chemical components in T. chebula extract were identified by UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS analysis, and network pharmacology analysis indicated that the NF-κB pathway was the potential pathway associated with the therapeutic effects of T. chebula extract on HN. RT‒PCR analysis, immunofluorescence staining and ELISA demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of TLR4 and MyD88 were significantly decreased in the renal tissue of HN rats after treatment with T. chebula extract at different concentrations, while the phosphorylation of P65 and the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly inhibited. The results of in vitro experiments showed that T. chebula extract significantly decreased the protein levels of TLR4, MyD88, p-IκBα and p-P65 in uric acid-treated HK-2 cells and inhibited the nuclear translocation of p65 in these cells. In addition, the expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and fibrotic genes (α-SMA and fibronectin) was significantly downregulated by T. chebula extract treatment, while E-cadherin expression was significantly upregulated. CONCLUSION: T. chebula extract exerts nephroprotective effects on HN, such as anti-inflammatory effects and fibrosis improvement, by regulating the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB axis, which supports the general use of T. chebula in the management of HN and other chronic kidney diseases.",

      "abstract": "Background: The Chinese pharmacopeia records Terminalia chebula as effective in treating prolonged diarrhea and dysentery, blood in the stool, and prolapse. Modern pharmacological research proves it has multiple pharmacological benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and other properties. Objectives: This study aims to clarify the role of Terminalia chebula's ethyl acetate extract (TCEA) on ulcerative colitis (UC) induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in mice, as well as explore the potential mechanism of action. Materials and methods: The variation of different extracts of T. chebula was detected using the HPLC technique, and the main components in TCEA were identified. DSS was used to establish a mouse model to mimic the physiological state of UC in humans; the alleviating effect of TCEA and positive control 5-ASA on UC mice were evaluated by gavage treatment. Disease progression was assessed by monitoring the mouse's weight change and disease activity index (DAI). The changes in colon tissue were estimated by measuring colon length, HE, and AB-PAS staining and detecting oxidative stress parameters. The results draw from Western blot and real-time PCR showed the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway may involve in the anti-inflammatory activity of TCEA. Furthermore, the gut flora sequencing technique was employed to monitor the differentiation of intestinal microbiota of mice induced by DSS and TCEA treatment. Results: TCEA significantly lowered DAI scores and inhibited the weight loss and colonic shortening induced by DSS. The colon histomorphology and oxidative stress levels were enhanced after TCEA treatment compared with DSS induced UC group. TCEA attenuated the inflammatory response by regulating TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway activation. Intestinal flora sequencing showed that DSS and TCEA greatly impacted mice's composition and diversity of intestinal microorganisms. But TCEA increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased the abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria compared with the DSS group, which contributed a lot to returning the intestinal flora to a balanced state. Conclusion: This study confirms the alleviating effect of TCEA on UC and provides new ideas for developing TCEA into a new drug to treat UC."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women, and alternative therapies with fewer side effects are actively being explored. Breast cancer is a significant global health concern, and conventional treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy often have side effects. Medicinal plant extracts offer a promising avenue for the development of effective and safe anticancer therapies. Terminalia chebula, a plant known for its medicinal properties, was selected for investigation in this study. We aimed to assess the antiproliferative effects of TCF extract on breast cancer cells and explore the potential role of saccharopine, a phytochemical found in TCF, as an anticancer agent. MCF7 breast cancer cell lines were exposed to TCF extract, and cell viability and apoptosis assays were performed to evaluate the antiproliferative and apoptogenic effects. Molecular docking studies were conducted to assess the binding affinity of saccharopine with EGFRs. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding energy calculations were employed to analyze the stability of the EGFR-saccharopine complex. The TCF extract exhibited significant antiproliferative effects on MCF7 breast cancer cells and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Molecular docking analysis revealed that saccharopine demonstrated a higher binding affinity with EGFR compared to the reference compound (17b-estradiol). The subsequent MDS simulations indicated stable binding patterns and conformation of the EGFR-saccharopine complex, suggesting a potential role in inhibiting EGFR-mediated signaling pathways. The investigation of Terminalia chebula fruit extract and its phytochemical saccharopine has revealed promising antiproliferative effects and a strong binding affinity with EGFR. These findings provide a foundation for future research aimed at isolating saccharopine and conducting in vivo studies to evaluate its potential as a targeted therapy for breast cancer. The development of novel anticancer agents from plant sources holds great promise in advancing the field of oncology and improving treatment outcomes for breast cancer patients."

In this study, we evaluated the preventive effects of crocin and alcoholic extract of the T. chebula alone and in combination to examine their efficacy against chronic restraint stress (CRS)‑induced cognitive impairment, anxiety‑like behaviors, hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficit as well as neuronal arborization damage in the hippocampal CA1 neurons. Over 14 consecutive days, animals received crocin, T. chebula, or their combination (5 min before CRS). The elevated plus‑maze results showed that crocin and T. chebula alone and in combination treatment significantly increased the time spent in open arms, percentage of open arm entries, and head dipping as compared with the CRS group. Barnes maze results showed that administration of crocin and T. chebula alone and their combination significantly improves spatial memory indicators such as distance traveled, latency time to achieving the target hole, and the number of errors when compared to the CRS group. These learning deficits in CRS animals correlated with a reduction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 synapses, which both T. chebula and crocin treatment improved field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) amplitude and fEPSP slope reduction induced by CRS. Golgi‑Cox staining showed that T. chebula and crocin treatment increased the number of dendrites and soma arbors in the CA1 neurons compared with the CRS group. Our results suggest that both T. chebula and crocin attenuated CRS‑induced anxiety‑like behaviors, memory impairment, and synaptic plasticity loss in hippocampal CA1 neurons. We found no significant difference between single treatments of T. chebula or crocin and their combination in protecting CRS‑induced anxiety‑like behaviors, memory impairment, and synaptic plasticity loss in hippocampal CA1 neurons.",

      "abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the development of natural AChE inhibitors as candidates has played a significant role in drug discovery. In this study, the inhibition mechanisms of four ellagitannins, punicalagin, chebulinic acid, geraniin and corilagin, from Terminalia chebula fruits on AChE were investigated systematically by a combination of inhibition kinetics, multi-spectroscopic methods and molecular docking. The kinetic results showed that punicalagin, chebulinic acid and geraniin exhibited strong reversible inhibitory effects on AChE in an uncompetitive manner with the IC50 values of 0.43, 0.50, and 0.51 mM, respectively, while corilagin inhibited AChE activity in a mixed type with the IC50 value of 0.72 mM. The results of fluorescence and UV-vis spectra and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) revealed that four ellagitannins could significantly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of AChE though a static quenching along with non-radiative energy transfer. Thermodynamic analyses showed that values of ΔG, ΔH and ΔS were negative, indicating that all binding processes were spontaneous, and the hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals forces might make a great contribution to the formation of inhibitor-AChE complexes. The synchronous fluorescence, three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence, UV-vis, and FT-IR spectra studies suggested that four ellagitannins could lead to alterations in the micro-environment and secondary structure of AChE, and thus the conformational change of AChE. Moreover, molecular docking demonstrated that four ellagitannins could interacted with main amino acid residues of AChE with affinity energies ranging from -9.9 to -8.7 kJ/mol, and further confirmed the above experimental results. This study provided valuable findings for the potential application of four ellagitannins as promising candidates in the exploration of natural AChE inhibitors for the treatment of AD.",

The present work was designed to study the effect of the aqueous extract of T. chebula fruits in type 2 diabetic rats. METHODS: The aqueous extract of the fruits was prepared by the double maceration technique. The extract was subjected to HPTLC analysis, which showed the presence of ellagic acid and gallic acid. Type 2 diabetes was induced in rats with a low dose of Streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) after administering a high-fat diet for fourteen days. Diabetic animals were treated with 500 and 1000 mg/kg of aqueous extract of T. chebula fruits for six weeks. RESULTS: Diabetic rats showed a significantly (511.7 ± 17.6) (p < 0.001) high plasma glucose level compared to the normal group (106 ± 3.358). The T. chebula treatment group showed a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in plasma glucose at 500 mg/kg (394.3 ± 10.35) and 1000 mg/kg (368.6 ± 30.08) doses when compared with the diabetic control group. Treatment with aqueous extract significantly reduced lipid parameters in diabetic animals when compared to the animals in the diabetic control group. Treatment with extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg showed a significant reduction in AST (p < 0.01, p < 0.001) when compared with diabetic control rats. Treatment with extract significantly reduced ALT at 500 mg/kg (p < 0.05) and 1000 mg/kg (p < 0.001) doses when compared with diabetic control rats. The extract treatment improved insulin sensitivity and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and significantly decreased HOMR-IR. Treatment with T. chebula aqueous extract at 1000 mg/kg significantly increased the level of GSH (p < 0.05) when compared to diabetic control rats. T. chebula treatment at 1000 mg/kg significantly increased levels of CAT (p < 0.01). Histopathology of pancreatic tissue revealed that the extract has a protective effect against the damage caused by hyperglycemia. Immunohistochemistry of pancreatic tissue showed increased expression of SIRT1 in diabetic animals treated with the extract. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate that the extract of T. chebula has significant effects in the management of type 2 diabetes."

The hydroalcoholic extract obtained from four fruit samples of T. chebula collected from different locations in Manipur were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) for their chemical constituents and evaluated for their anticancer activity against the colon cancer cell HCT 116. GC-MS analysis results indicated significant variation in the composition and percentage of major compounds present in the extracts. 1,2,3-Benzenetriol was the most abundant chemical constituent present in all four extracts of T. chebula, ranging from 20.95 to 43.56%. 2-Cyclopenten-1-one, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and catechol were commonly present in all extracts. Two marker compounds, gallic acid and ellagic acid, were also quantified usingHPTLC in all four extracts of T. chebula. The highest content of gallic acid (22.44 ± 0.056 µg/mg of dried extract) was observed in TCH, and that of ellagic acidwas found in TYH (11.265 ± 0.089 µg/mg of dried extract). The IC50 value of TYH for the DPPH and ABTS assays (12.16 ± 0.42 and 7.80 ± 0.23 µg/mL) was found to be even lower than that of Trolox (18 ± 0.44 and 10.15 ± 0.24 µg/mL), indicating its strong antioxidant properties among the four extracts of T. chebula. The MTT assay determined the effect of T. chebula extracts on the viability of HCT 116 cells. TYH showed the highest activity with anIC50 value of 52.42 ± 0.87 µg/mL, while the lowest activity was observed in TCH (172.05 ± 2.0 µg/mL). The LDH assay confirmed the cytotoxic effect of TYH in HCT 116 cells. TYH was also found to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in HCT 116 cells after 48 h of treatment. Our study provides insight into the diversity of T. chebula in Manipur and its potential activity against colon cancer.",

Thus, the efficacy and safety of Terminalia chebula Retz. fruit powder mixed with vinegar was compared with terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream in the treatment of tinea corporis in order to establish the non-inferiority of test drugs. METHODS: The primary outcome measures were change in the presence or absence of hyphae on KOH mount test, change in pruritus severity assessed on 100 mm VAS and change in physician's global assessment. Secondary outcome measure was change in the dermatology life quality index (DLQI). Hemograms, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, and random blood sugar levels were measured at the baseline and after treatment to ensure the safety of the interventions. RESULTS: A per-protocol analysis was done on 40 participants (21 in the test group and 19 in the control group). The observed differences in the primary and secondary outcomes between the test and control groups were greater than the non-inferiority margin, signifying that the test drugs were not inferior. CONCLUSIONS: It may be inferred that the trial drug Terminalia chebula Retz. fruit powder mixed with vinegar is not inferior to terbinafine hydrochloride cream in the treatment of tinea corporis.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal treatment was initiated on sixty human single-rooted premolars and working length was established. The canals were enlarged using ProTaper universal system till F3. The prepared canals were obturated with Gutta-percha (GP) and AH Plus sealer followed by post-space preparation. Twenty canals contained a standard strain of E. faecalis (n=5 in each group) cultured overnight at 37 °C in BHI broth. All the samples were randomly allocated into four groups based on post-space irrigation. (n = 10) Group 1: 5.25% NaOCl+17% EDTA (Control), Group 2: 5.25% NaOCl + ICG, Group 3: 5.25% NaOCl + MG and Group 4: 5.25% NaOCl + T. chebula. Survival rates of E. faecalis were evaluated on the twenty specimens. GFP was placed on the remaining samples using self-etch dual-cure pastes and sectioning was performed in 1 mm thick slices. PBS and failure mode were analyzed using a universal testing machine and stereomicroscope. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey multiple comparison t-tests were used for data analysis. (p = 0.05). RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl+17% EDTA demonstrated (0.11±0.01 CFU/mL) the lowest survival rate of E. faecalis. However, Group 2 (5.25% NaOCl + ICG) exhibited the highest survival rate (0.52 ± 0.10). Furthermore, the coronal third of group 4 (5.25% NaOCl + T. chebula) (8.71±0.25 MPa) specimens demonstrated the highest PBS of GFP. However, an apical section of group 2 samples (5.25% NaOCl + ICG) (1.21±0.71 MPa) displayed the lowest outcome of bond integrity. CONCLUSION: Terminalia chebula when used as a final canal disinfectant seems to be promising in improving canal sterility and the bond strength of GFP to the root dentin.",

However, the skin effects of TC as an oral supplement have not been studied. The objective of this study is to determine if oral TC fruit extract supplementation can modulate the skin's sebum production and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. A prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted on healthy females aged 25-65. Subjects were supplemented with an oral placebo or Terminalia chebula (250 mg capsule, Synastol TC) capsules twice daily for eight weeks. A facial image collection and analysis system was used to assess the facial appearance of wrinkle severity. Standardized, non-invasive tools were used to measure facial moisture, sebum production, transepidermal water loss, melanin index and erythema index. For those who had a baseline sebum excretion rate >80 ug/cm2, TC supplementation produced a significant decrease in forehead sebum excretion rate compared to the placebo at four weeks (-17 decrease vs. 20% increase, p = 0.07) and at eight weeks (-33% decrease vs. 29% increase, p < 0.01). Cheek erythema decreased by 2.2% at eight weeks, while the placebo treatment increased cheek erythema by 1.5% (p < 0.05). Facial wrinkles decreased by 4.3% in the TC group and increased by 3.9% in the placebo group after eight weeks of supplementation (p < 0.05). TC supplementation reduces facial sebum and improves the appearance of wrinkles. Future studies should consider evaluating oral TC as adjuvant therapy for acne vulgaris."

In the current study, IR-775, a hydrophobic photosensitizer, was used in combination with a polyphenols (p)-rich ethyl acetate extract from Terminalia chebula to treat cancer. IR-775 dye and polyphenols were encapsulated in a poly(lactic acid) polymeric nanosystem (PpIR NPs) to increase the cell bioavailability. The hydrodynamic diameter of PpIR NPs is 142.6 ± 2 nm and exhibited physical stability. The nanosystem showed enhanced cellular uptake in a lung cancer cell line (A549). Cell cytotoxicity results indicate that PpIR NPs showed more than 82.46 ± 3% cell death upon NIR light treatment compared to the control groups. Both PDT and PTT generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause hyperthermia, thereby enhancing cancer cell death. Qualitative and quantitative analyses have depicted that PpIR NPs with NIR light irradiation have decreased protein expression of HSP70 and PARP, and increased γ-H2AX, which collectively lead to cell death. After NIR light irradiation, the relative gene expression patterns of HSP70 and CDK2Na were also downregulated. Further, PpIR NPs uptake has been studied in 3D cells and in ovo bioimaging in zebrafish models. In conclusion, the PpIR NPs show good cancer cell cytotoxicity and present a potential nanosystem for bioimaging.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Terminalia chebula (TC) is a traditional medicinal plant used for treating various diseases in humans. However, pharmacological mechanisms underlying the effects of TC in atopic treatment remain unelucidated. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: We investigated the therapeutic effects of TC extract in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis (AD) in vivo and the anti-inflammatory mechanism in vitro. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: For the in vivo study, AD was induced by Dermatophagoides farinae extract (Dfe) in NC/Nga mice. After 14 days of oral administration, the effects of TC concentrations of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg were analyzed by assessing morphological changes visually; measuring serum levels of inflammatory chemokines/cytokines, IgE, histamine, MDC, TARC, RANTES, and TSLP using ELISA kits; and counting infiltrated mast cells. For in vitro analyses, we used IFNγ/TNF-α-stimulated human keratinocyte cell lines to study the mechanism of action. The production of chemokines/cytokines in the IFNγ/TNF-α-stimulated HaCaT cells was measured using ELISA and a bead array kit. The signaling pathways were analyzed by western blotting and the expression of the transcriptional factors using RT-PCR and luciferase assay. RESULTS: Administration of TC significantly alleviated AD-like symptoms in vivo and decreased the ear thickness, dermatitis score, keratinization, and mast cell infiltration. It also resulted in decreased serum levels of IgE, histamine, and inflammation-related mediators MDC, TARC, RANTES, and TSLP compared with those in the Dfe treatment group. Moreover, TC downregulated the expression of the inflammatory chemokines RANTES and MDC in IFNγ/TNF-α-stimulated HaCaT cells. TC inhibited phosphorylated STAT1/3 and NK-κB subunits and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. It also suppressed the transcription of IFNγ, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 in the IFNγ/TNF-α-stimulated HaCaT cells. TC and its constituents, chebulic acid, gallic acid, corlagin, chebulanin, chbulagic acid, ellagic acid, and chebulinic acid, strongly inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, STAT1, and STAT3 and decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines at the mRNA level. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, TC extract alleviated AD-like symptoms by regulating anti-inflammatory factors in vivo and suppressing STAT1/3 and NF-κB signaling in vitro. In addition, our results show the in vivo effect of partial improvements in AD, as well as the in vitro effect on inflammatory factors by the constituents of TC. This finding provides that TC extract and its components could be potential therapeutic drugs for AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Deposition of amyloid β plaques (Aβ) is a central hallmark of AD. Accumulating evidence suggest that shifting amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism pathway to non-amyloidogenic ways and inducing autophagy play key roles in AD pathology. In published reports, there is no research on the APP metabolic process of Terminalia chebula Retz. (T. Chebula). PURPOSE: The study aims to assess the effects of T. Chebula in AD transgenic SH-SY5Y cells to determine its underlying mechanisms on reducing Aβ level by regulating APP metabolic process. METHODS: The effects of T. Chebula water extract (TWE) on APPswe transgenic SH-SY5Y cells were analyzed by cell viability. ELISA used to quantify extracellular Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 generations. Western blot and RT-PCR assays were chosen to detect the expression of proteins and genes. The acridine orange (AO) stain was used to label autophagic-vesicles. RESULTS: Treatment with TWE significantly suppressed the Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 generations of APPswe transgenic cells. TWE inhibited amyloidogenic pathway by reducing BACE1 expression, and promote non-amyloidogenic pathway by inducing ADAM10 level of APP metabolism. Additionally, TWE induced autophagy in APPswe transgenic cells involved in APP metabolism to shift the balance to non-amyloidogenic pathway. CONCLUSION: In summary, our finding first time expounded that TWE can inhibit the generation of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 in APPswe transgenic SH-SY5Y cells, which were regulated APP metabolism tends to non-amyloid metabolism pathway and mediated by autophagy. The results presented a novel finding for AD treatment of traditional natural medicines.",

Terminalia chebula is considered as the mother of herbs, with reported antidiabetic activity. This study aims to evaluate the renal and hepatic protective profile of its antidiabetic therapeutic doses. METHODS: To achieve the aim of the study, a total of 66 adult male rats of Sprague-Dawley species weighing about 180-200 g (weighed using a digital scale) were used. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was induced in using streptozotocin (STZ), rats were given a 5% dextrose solution for the next 24 h. Subjects received oral treatment of Terminalia chebula ethanolic extract at different doses (200, 400, and 600 mg/kg body weight) for 28 days. Measurements of fasting blood glucose level, change in body weight, lipid profile, serum liver enzymes, serum renal parameter, and histopathology of liver and kidney were carried out. RESULTS: Higher doses of Terminalia chebula (600 mg/Kg) were shown to have a potential therapeutic effect as well as the most prominent antidiabetic, antilipidemic activity, hepatoprotective and renoprotective profiles when compared to lower doses. CONCLUSION: The use of Terminalia chebula alone or in combination with conventional antidiabetic drugs may be beneficial as a new advent therapy for diabetes.

Terminalia chebula retzius extracts (TREs) isolated by our lab have great antioxidant activity and its effect on METH-induced memory deficits has not been investigated yet. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effect of TREs on METH induced cell apoptosis in vitro and memory deficits in vivo. The results showed that TREs treatment attenuated free radical release and improved cell survival of primary hippocampal neurons after METH injury. In the Morris water maze task, TREs treatment reversed METH-induced learning and memory deficits in acquisition and retention. Moreover, TREs reduced oxidative stress in the serum and hippocampus of mice. Additionally, extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) pathway and the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway were inactivated after METH treatment, and were significantly activated after TREs pretreatment. These findings suggest that TREs may exert potent neuroprotective effect via activation of both ERK and Nrf2 pathways, thus providing a basis for its potential use for ameliorating memory deficits induced by METH.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a global pandemic claiming more than 6 million lives worldwide as of 16 March 2022. Till date, no medicine has been developed which is proved to have 100% efficiency in combating against this deadly disease. We focussed on ayurvedic medicines to identify drug-like candidates for treatment and management of COVID-19. Among all ayurvedic medicines, we were interested in Terminalia chebula (T. chebula), as it is known to have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated potential inhibitory effects of phytochemicals from T. chebula against eight structural and functional proteins of SARS-CoV-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed blind molecular docking studies using fifteen phytochemicals from T. chebula against the proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The three-dimensional proteins structures were analysed and potential drug-binding sites were identified. The drug-likeness properties of the ligands were assessed as well. RESULTS: Analysing the docking results by comparing Atomic Contact Energy (ACE) and intermolecular interactions along with assessment of ADME/T properties identified 1,3,6-Trigalloyl glucose (-332.14 ± 55.74 kcal/mol), Beta-Sitosterol (-324.75 ± 36.98 kcal/mol) and Daucosterol (-335.67 ± 104.79 kcal/mol) as most promising candidates which exhibit significantly high inhibition efficiency against all eight protein targets. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that our study has the potential to help the scientific communities to develop multi-target drugs from T. chebula to combat against the deadly pathogen of COVID-19, with the support of extensive wet lab analysis."

METHODS: The study was conducted in Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Iran in 2017. Half maximal effective (concentration (EC50) of T. chebula extract and pyrimethamine was determined in infected Hela cells by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. In the animal model, BALB/c mice were injected with tachyzoites (104) of T. RH strain intraperitoneally. 24h after the injection, the test groups were orally treated with 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of T. chebula extract for 7 days. The survival rate of the mice was determined and blood samples were collected to determine the amount of serum Malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant capacity. Then peritoneal fluid of the mice was collected to count the number of tachyzoites and after necropsy, the pathologic changes, including the weight of liver, spleen and kidneys were investigated. The analysis of data was accomplished using SPSS. RESULTS: EC50 values were 94.7μg/mL and 290.50μg/mL for T. chebula and pyrimethamine respectively. In the animal model, the extract of T. chebula in concentration of 100 mg/kg showed the same anti-Toxoplasma effect as pyrimethamine. This concentration of the extract decreased number of intraperitoneal tachyzoites and increased the survival rate of the mice. This extract reduced the levels of serum MDA and tissue inflammation and increased serum antioxidant capacity. CONCLUSION: Regarding the positive effect of extract, after more clinical trials in the animal model and standardization of the extract, it can be used as an alternative or complementary therapy for toxoplasmosis."

      "abstract": "With the increasing demand of new drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), screening acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) has been proved to be an effective strategy for drug discovery. In present study, a novel strategy was developed to fish out AChE inhibitors from Terminalia chebula fruits based on immobilized AChE coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) and molecular docking. For AChE immobilization, cellulose filter paper (CFP) as the carrier was modified with chitosan to be introduced to amino groups, and then AChE was modified on the amino-modified CFP through a Schiff base reaction with glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. The CPF-immobilized AChE possessed advantages of a wider range for pH and temperature endurance, better storage stability, excellent reproducibility and reusability. The CPF-immobilized AChE was incubated with the extract of T. chebula fruits, and then the active components would form complexes with immobilized AChE. The complexes were further conveniently separated with inactive components by virtue of the instantaneous separation characteristic of CFP. Eventually, 25 (1-11, 13-26) potential AChE inhibitors were fished out and their structures were further identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS. Moreover, molecular docking was performed to discriminate non-specific compounds to AChE and explore binding mechanisms between potential inhibitors and AChE, and 25 compounds could be well embedded into active sites of AChE with affinities ranging from -9.9 to -6.4 kcal/mol. Inhibitory activities of screened active components on AChE were evaluated in vitro, and punicalagin, 1,3,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (1,3,6-TGG), chebulinic acid and geraniin exhibited excellent AChE-inhibitory properties with IC50 values of 0.43 ± 0.03, 0.46 ± 0.02, 0.50 ± 0.03 and 0.51 ± 0.03 mM, respectively. The results indicated that the developed method was simple and efficient, and could be utilized to screen and identify potential AChE inhibitors from TCMs.",

The present study was aimed to investigate the comorbid antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects of ethanol extract from T.chebula fruit using experimental behavioral tests in mice. In addition, the study explored the effects of extract on monoamine oxidase -A (MAO-A) levels in mouse brain. Two doses of the T.chebula extract (100 or 200 mg/kg, p.o.) were treated continuously for fifteen days to mice. Regarding antidepressant-like effects, the treatment of T.chebula extract at both dose (100 or 200 mg/kg, p.o.) levels resulted with significant (p < 0.001) reduction in duration of immobility time and increase in swimming time as compared to control group in forced swimming test. Moreover, both doses declined the duration of immobility time in the tail suspension test and increased the number of crossing in the center area using open-field test. Additionally, the dose 200 mg/kg treatment showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in MAO-A activity in mouse brain. For anxiolytic activity, both doses significantly (p < 0.001) improved the time spent in open arm and the number of head dips in elevated plus maze test. The higher duration of time spent in light chamber and higher number of crossing between the light and dark chambers by extract treatment in light-dark box test also supported the anxiolytic behavior. The obtained results supported the antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects of ethanol extract of T.chebula in mice."

Serum myoglobin (MB) and troponin (cTn) were detected by ELISA. UPLC-Q Exactive/MS analysis was performed to detect the metabolic difference among the groups. ELISA results showed that the MB and cTn values of AKR group were significantly higher than Control group (P<0.05), while those of the other groups were lower than AKR group. TCR-prepared AKR group had similar MB and cTn contents to the Control group. Histopathological examination also indicated better detoxifying effects in the TCR-prepared AKR and AKR-TCR 1:1 group. The serum metabolomics analysis showed obvious distinction between the AKR and Control groups, while AKR-TCR combination reversed the metabolomics changes induced by AKR. Through multivariate statistical analysis, 9 metabolic markers related to energy, nucleic acid and amino acid metabolism were identified. Conclusively, AKR-induced cardiotoxicity may be related to energy, nucleic acid and amino acid metabolism, and TCR can reduce the cardiotoxicity by regulating the relative metabolism pathways.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate a standardized Terminalia chebula (TC) fruit extract for its long-lasting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to reverse the visible signs of pollution-induced skin damage in an 8-week clinical study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Chemical and cell-based in vitro studies were performed to characterize long-lasting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; a clinical study with subjects with normal to dry skin living in a high-pollution city for the previous 5 years was conducted to assess if a formulation containing 1% standardized TC fruit extract affected significant improvements in skin's visible condition and appearance compared with its placebo. RESULTS: The standardized TC fruit extract provided longer-lasting and more efficient neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than tocopherol; treatment of keratinocytes with the fruit extract prior to being stressed with urban dust safeguarded against increases in intracellular ROS, inhibited release of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 and protected membrane lipids against peroxidation. A clinical study yielded statistically significant improvements in dermatologist scores and subject self-assessments for skin texture, hydration, tone, firmness and radiance as compared to its placebo. CONCLUSION: These studies validate the use of this standardized TC fruit extract not only as a restorative to diminish visible signs of existing damage but also as a preventative to help defend skin against damages caused by chronic exposure to environmental pollution."

Antioxidant activities of different concentrations of Terminalia chebula and Thymbra spicata extracts were evaluated with DPPH assay. Semen samples were taken from three fertile adult rams. After diluting semen with Tris-base extender, different concentrations of Terminalia chebula and Thymbra spicata (30, 300, and 3000 μg/ml) extracts were used under normal and induced OS conditions. The group not receiving any supplements was considered as control group. A total of 50 μM hydrogen peroxide was used to induce OS. MTT solution was added to each of treatment groups which were kept in an incubator at 37°C for 2 h. After incubation, readings were obtained by ELISA reader. DNA integrity and LPO were determined with acridine orange (AO) staining and malondialdehyde (MDA) assay. Higher concentrations of Terminalia chebula and Thymbra spicata extracts preserved viability and DNA integrity while reducing MDA concentrations compared to other treatment groups. Also, under induced OS, higher concentrations of both extracts reduced detrimental effects of H2 O2 . In conclusion, it seems that addition of Terminalia chebula and Thymbra spicata extracts can reduce induced OS in spermatozoa.",

Streptococcus mutans is a primary cariogenic bacterium commonly found in the human oral cavity. Oral hygiene products containing antibacterial ingredients can be helpful in caries management. In this study, we investigated the anticaries mechanism of the ethanol extract of Terminalia chebula (EETC) on S. mutans and suggest its possible application as a functional ingredients for oral hygiene products. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EETC was prepared from the Terminalia chebula fruit. Disk diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and colony forming unit (CFU) were analyzed to observe the antibacterial activity of EETC. The glucan formation was measured using the filtrate of bacterial culture medium and sucrose. Gene expression was analyzed using RT-PCR. Cytotoxicity was analyzed using the MTT assay. The radical-scavenging activities of DPPH and ABTS were also tested to verify the antioxidant activity of EETC. RESULTS: The antibacterial activity of the EETC was explored through a disc diffusion analysis and CFU measurement. EETC treatment decreased insoluble glucan formation and gene expression of glycosyltransferase B (gtf B), glycosyltransferase C (gtf C), glycosyltransferase D (gtf D), and fructosyltransferase (ftf). The MIC and MBC of EETC on S. mutans were not cytotoxic to gingival fibroblasts. In addition, we observed DPPH and ABTS-radical scavenging activities of EETC. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the antibacterial and antioxidant effects of EETC may contribute to oral hygiene products for dental caries management.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Terminalia chebula (TC), a well-known Indian Ayurvedic medicine introduced into China in the Sui and Tang Dynasties, has been recorded and used medicinally as Fructus Chebulae, together with its variety tomentella (TCT) in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. They have been also used commonly for the treatment of diabetes mellitus by Tibetan medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the main bioactive and therapeutic principles in the fruits of TCT, based on the extensive evaluation of their anti-inflammatory and hypoglycemic activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TCT fresh fruits were analyzed by HPLC and separated further by column chromatography and preparative HPLC. The isolated compounds were identified by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including 1D/2D NMR, MS, UV, IR and ECD. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by inhibition of NO production in RAW264.7 cells. The specific iNOS (PDB ID: 3E7G) structure was prepared by Discovery Studio 4.0, and the molecular docking simulation was performed on GOLD (version 5.2.2). Hypoglycemic activity was measured using the substrate solution of 4-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside enzyme and buffer solution. RESULTS: The HPLC analysis method of polyphenols in the fruits of TCT was established, and 13 main chromatographic peaks were identified, including six hydrolyzable tannins (2, 4-7, 10-11), three simple phenols (12-14), and one oleanane pentacyclic triterpene, arjungenin. Extensive chromatographic separation of TCT fresh fruits yielded 14 compounds, including one new natural hydrolyzable tannin, 2,3-(S)-HHDP-6-O-galloyl-d-glucose (1). The known compounds were identified as 10 hydrolyzable tannins (2-11) and three simple phenols (12-14). Compounds 10 (IC50 = 36.43 ± 0.21 μM), 11 (IC50 = 42.28 ± 0.09 μM) displayed stronger NO inhibitory activity than the positive control L-NMMA (IC50 = 42.34 ± 0.66 μM), while 2, 4, and 9 showed moderate inhibitory activity against NO production. Further molecular docking simulation of specific iNOS on 10 and 11, as well as five previously isolated lignans 15-19 showed that there were no obvious rules between docking results and the in vitro NO inhibitory activity for hydrolyzable tannins (10 and 11), while the mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity for lignans was related to the substitution of conjugated aldehyde groups. Moreover, most of the hydrolyzable tannins (1-2, 4-5, 9-11) and simple phenol (12) displayed stronger inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase than the positive control, quercetin (IC50 = 6.118 ± 0.071 μM), with IC50 values ranging from 0.079 to 16.494 μM. Among these bioactive isolates, the hydrolyzable tannins 2, 4-5, and 9-11, and simple phenol 12 are major chemical components in TCT fruit. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that lignans and hydrolyzed tannins are the main active ingredients of TCT fruits, responsible for the traditional treatment of sore throat and cough. Moreover, hydrolyzed tannins and simple phenolic compounds with potential hypoglycemic activity are closely related to the ethno-pharmacological uses of TCT fruits on diabetes in Tibetan medicine.",

The present study investigates the preventive effect of Zingiber officinale-Terminalia chebula extract (ZOTC) against DMBA-induced breast cancer in a rat model. Bioactive compounds from ZO (6-gingerol, 6-shogaol) and TC (gallic acid, ellagic acid, corilagin, chebulinic acid, and chebulagic acid) were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography. Mammary carcinogenesis was induced in rats with a single subcutaneous injection of 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Oral administration of ZOTC ameliorated the antioxidant status in mammary tissues, serum lipid levels, and serum cytokines. Histological analysis of the mammary tissue (normal and tumor) was carried out to obtain pathological alterations due to ZOTC treatment. The effect of ZOTC on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) gene and accumulation of corresponding gene product was also investigated. mTOR plays a central role in cell metabolism and proliferation in normal and cancer cells. Transcriptional and immunohistochemical analysis showed the downregulation of mTOR expression in the mammary tissues of ZOTC-treated rats. In conclusion, the results obtained suggest that ZOTC can suppress tumor progression in DMBA-induced breast cancer rats via inhibition of the mTOR pathway.",

T.chebula is known as the \"King of Tibetan Medicine\", due to its widespread clinical pharmacological activity such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antidiabetic as well as anticancer in lots of in vivo and in vitro models. In this study, we use transgenic and/or RNAi Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) model to simulation the AD pathological features induced by Aβ, to detect the effect of TWE on improving Aβ-induced toxicity and the corresponding molecular mechanism. AIM OF STUDY: The study aimed to tested the activities and its possible mechanism of T.chebula to against Aβ1-42 induced toxicity and Aβ1-42 aggregation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using transgenic C.elegans strain CL2006 and CL4176 as models respond to paralytic induced by Aβ toxicity. The transcription factors DAF-16 and SKN-1 were analyzed used a fluorescence microscope in transgenic strains (DAF-16:GFP, SKN-1:GFP). The function of DAF-16 and SKN-1 was further investigated using loss-of-function strains by feeding RNA interference (RNAi) bacteria. To evaluate the aggregation level of Aβ in the transgenic C.elegans, Thioflavin S (ThS) staining and WB visualized the levels of Aβ monomers and oligomers. RESULTS: TWE treatment can significantly improve the paralysis of transgenic C.elegans caused by Aβ aggregation (up to 14%). The Aβ aggregates in transgenic C.elegans are significantly inhibited under TWE exposure (up to 70%). TWE increases the nuclear localization of the key transcription factor DAF-16 and HSF-1, which in turn leads to the expression of downstream Hsp-16.2 protein and exerts its inhibitory effect on Aβ aggregation. Meanwhile, paralysis improved has not observed in SKN-1 mutation and/or RNAi C.elegans. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that TWE can protect C.elegans against the Aβ1-42-induced toxicity, inhibition Aβ1-42 aggregation and delaying Aβ-induced paralysis. The neuroprotective effect of TWE involves the activation of DAF-16/HSF-1/Hsp-16.2 pathway.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To explore the molecular mechanism of gallic acid (GA) from Terminalia chebula in suppressing the growth of esophageal carcinoma (EC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human EC cells (EC9706 and KYSE450) were treated with different concentrations of GA (10, 20, and 40 μg/ml), which were subjected to 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, plate clone formation assay, Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining, and Western blotting. EC mice were divided into Model, 0.3% GA, and 1% GA groups to observe the tumor volume and the expressions of YAP, TAZ, Ki-67, and Caspase-3 in tumor tissues. RESULTS: GA decreased cell viability and colony formation of EC9706 and KYSE450 cells, which was more obvious as the concentration increased. In addition, GA promoted cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner with the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9) and nuclear YAP/TAZ, as well as the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the levels of p-YAP and p-TAZ. Moreover, GA decreased the growth of xenograft tumor in vivo, with the reduction in the tumor volume and the reduction of YAP and TAZ expressions in the tumor tissues. In addition, Ki-67 expression in GA groups was lower than those in the Model group, with the increase in caspase-3 expression in the tumor tissues. Changes aforementioned were obviously shown in the 0.3% GA group. CONCLUSION: GA blocked the activity of the Hippo pathway to suppress cell proliferation of EC and facilitate cell apoptosis, which is expected to be a novel strategy for treatment of EC."

The present work reports a method for a facile and an eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Terminalia chebula fruit extract (TCE). The obtained AgNPs was characterized by using different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The analysis of the results revealed that the as-obtained AgNPs have spherical morphology with an average diameter of 22 nm. Furthermore, the preliminary bioactivity evaluations revealed that the bio-conjugation of AgNPs, using TCE, significantly enhanced the antibacterial and anti-breast cancer potentials of the latter. The antibacterial activity of the as-prepared AgNPs showed that B. subtilis was more sensitive towards the AgNPs, followed by P. aeruginosa; while, E. coli and S. mutans showed comparatively minimal sensitivity toward the AgNPs. The IC50 values of TCE, AgNPs and TCE + AgNPs treatment of MCF-7 were found to be 17.53, 14.25 and 6.484 µg/mL, respectively. Therefore, it can be ascertained that the bio-conjugation may provide a headway with regard to the therapeutic employment of T. chebula, upon mechanistically understanding the basis of observed antibacterial and anticancer activities.",

The TCME was evaluated for in vitro anticancer activity on A549 and MCF-7 cells. TCME showed cytotoxicity toward A549 (IC50 - 359.06 ± 20.04 µg/ml), and MCF-7 (IC50 - 61.02 ± 5.55 µg/ml) cells. The flow-cytometer analysis revealed increase in sub G1 population and apoptotic population, which were observed through cell cycle analysis and annexin-V-FLUOS staining. Confocal microscopy showed DNA fragmentation in both the cell lines upon TCME treatment. Moreover, TCME treatment induces activation of apoptosis-related caspase-cascade pathways in both the cell lines. TCME treatment on RAW 264.7 cells revealed the anti-inflammatory properties by regulating nitrite and TNF-α production; iNOS, COX-2 levels, and translocation of NF-κB protein. Finally, HPLC analysis revealed the bioactive phytocompounds present in TCME. In conclusion, the combined results showed the potent anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties of T. chebula fruit. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in men with 35.5% incidences and 30.8% mortality rate worldwide. On the contrary, breast cancer possesses 55.2% incidences and 16.6% mortality rate among the female worldwide. The present findings revealed the anti-lung and -breast cancer activity along with the potent anti-inflammatory potentials of Terminalia chebula fruit. These findings will helpful to isolate the active drug molecules from the Terminalia chebula fruit and mark them as an anticancer and anti-inflammatory agent.",

However, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these benefits remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To profile dermal expression responses to a standardized tannin-enriched TC fruit extract (Synastol® TC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microarrays were used to evaluate gene expression in three-dimensional reconstituted human skin cultures. RESULTS: Genome-wide expression responses to TC were the opposite to those observed in cells exposed to oxidative stress, solar-simulated UV radiation, and wounding, with increased expression of genes associated with water homeostasis, skin barrier establishment, blood vessel development, and circadian rhythms. TC also increased expression of extracellular matrix components, such as collagens (COL1A1, COL1A2) and proteoglycans (PRELP, OGN), and in separate assays, we showed that TC inhibits MMP enzymes (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-12) and microbial activity (S. aureus, P. acnes). Unexpectedly, mRNA and protein levels of late keratinocyte (KC) differentiation markers (FLG, LOR) were increased by TC, and expression responses in skin cultures broadly resembled those that occur with KC differentiation. Consistent with these results, TC increased expression of transcription factors regulating KC differentiation (FOS, GHRL3, PPARG) and we noted enrichment of AP-1 binding sites in regions upstream of TC-increased genes. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that functionally important TC extract responses occur in the epidermis and are therefore not restricted to the dermal layer. Our findings thus suggest mechanisms by which TC may strengthen full-thickness skin architecture for treatment of skin aging and/or chronic wounds.",

Diverse virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa is due to distinct molecular cell signaling mechanism termed as quorum sensing (QS). Interfering with normal QS mechanism by active biomolecules is an effective strategy for attenuating its virulence. With this objective, the present study is undertaken to evaluate the inhibition of quorum sensing of clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa by repression of Las R-a transcriptional regulator for QS by ethanol extract of Terminalia chebula and Ficus racemosa. Las R repression by the plant extracts was measured in inhibition of various virulence factors like biofilm, pyocyanin production, total proteolytic activity, swarming and twisting motility. Fabrication of the extracted metabolites on the wound dressing and its effect on anti bacterial activity was also investigated. Compatibility of plant extracts on zebra fish development and blood cells was further studied. P. aeruginosa was isolated from the post operative patient and the isolated pure culture was identified by cultural, biochemical, molecular characteristics. Active principles of both the plants were readily extracted in ethanol and effectively repressed the expression of Las R. Both the tested plant extracts effectively repressed Las R expression which in turn affect the production of various virulence factors like biofilm formation, pyocyanin production, swarming motility, twisting motility, total proteolytic activity, cell adhesion and signaling molecule acyl honoserine lactone (AHL) production. Plant extract treatment brought about drastic reduction of all the tested virulence factors and AHL production. Extracted metabolites were fabricated on the wound dressing material adopting simple dip or immersion method reveals uniform coating, effective embedding of phytochemicals with the fibers and retained the anti bacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Biocompatibility studies with zebra fish model shows both the tested plant extracts treatment was not exhibited any sign of toxicity on the developmental stages of Zebra fish. Hemolysis and changes in anti oxidative enzymes were not recorded in the plant extracts treated blood which demonstrated the best biocompatibility of the tested plant extracts. These results shows that the presence of potential phytochemicals in the ethanolic extract of Terminalia chebula and Ficus racemosa effectively represses the Las R followed by inhibition of quorum sensing mediated virulence factors production may be useful in the lead of anti bacterial drugs.",

The 1:4 (ZOTC) ratio showed high cell survival percentage against the rat insulinoma cell line (RIN-5F) when compared to other possible ratios of ZOTC. Oral administration of ZO alone, TC alone, combined ZOTC (1:4), and the positive control metformin (Met) in fructose-streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats showed reduced blood glucose levels, reduced insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), increased insulin levels, and increased pancreatic beta cell function (HOMA-β). ZOTC treatment in diabetic rats ameliorated the antioxidant status without affecting liver and serum parameters. Histological evaluation of the pancreas was performed to find pathological changes; the transcriptional and immunohistochemistry results showed reduced mTOR expression in the pancreas during ZOTC treatment. Conclusively, the results obtained suggest that ZOTC treatment against fructose-STZ-induced type 2 diabetes rat models can help regulate blood glucose, insulin levels, and normalize pancreatic β cell damage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects a large number of populations worldwide. Zingiber officinale (ZO) and Terminalia chebula (TC) has been used in traditional medicine since ancient times against various ailments, including diabetes. In this study, we reported the effect of the combined ZOTC that showed significant blood glucose reduction and increased insulin levels via mTOR when compared to individual treatments.

In diabetic+dose 3, plasma TC, TG, and LDL-C and hepatic MDA level decreased (p<0.001), while plasma HDL-C and insulin, and hepatic thiol content, and SOD and CAT activities increased compared to diabetic (p<0.01-p<0.001). Treatment with dose 1 and 2 improved such abnormalities in diabetic rats except for insulin level (p<0.05-p<0.001). The herbal combination effects were comparable to those of metformin. Metformin did not significantly change serum insulin and HDL-C levels, and hepatic SOD activity; however, serum levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C, as well as hepatic MDA levels, thiol content and CAT activity were improved compared to diabetic (p<0.05-p<0.001). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that this herbal combination acts as an anti-diabetic, antioxidant and hypolipidemic agent and it may be suggested as a beneficial remedy for diabetic patients."

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydrolysable tannin-rich fraction (HTF) isolated from TC fruits in collagen-induced arthritic BALB/c mice. Type II collagen-induced arthritis was attained in BALB/c mice. HTF treatment at three gradual doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) was started from 24th day on daily administration up to 4 weeks. Body weight, food intake, and increase in hind paw were monitored at weekly basis. At the end of the study, serum and joint tissues were estimated for proinflammatory cytokines and biochemical parameters and the hind limbs were removed for radiological and histopathological evaluations. Oral administration of HTF could significantly protect CIA in BALB/c mice by reducing paw volume, arthritic score, spleen index, serum and joint cytokine level, and biochemical markers. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of HTF was further demonstrated by morphological observation, histopathological , and radiological evaluations. HTF is a good therapeutic agent for the treatment of joint inflammatory condition, as its action is mediated through cytokine inhibition.",

The purpose of this research is to investigate the hepatoprotective mechanism of chebulic acid against oxidative stress produced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) in liver cells. The treatment with chebulic acid attenuated cell death in t-BHP-induced HepG2 liver cells and increased intracellular glutathione content, upregulated the activity of heme oxygenase-1, and also increased the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and Nrf2 target gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. The exposure of chebulic acid activated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The overall result is that chebulic acid has cytoprotective effect on t-BHP-induced hepatotoxicity in HepG2 cells through Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes."

In the present study, methyl gallate (MG) isolated from Terminalia chebula was evaluated to determine the in vivo fluid accumulation-inhibitory, anticolonization and anti-inflammatory and in vitro biofilm-inhibitory activities against multi-drug resistant (MDR) V. cholerae. Bacterial membrane-damaging and biofilm-inhibitory activities were determined by membrane perturbation and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); and microdilution assays, respectively. Fluid accumulation-inhibitory and anticolonization activities of MG (23.80-95.23 mg/kg body weight) were determined in 4-5 days old BALB/c mice with an incubation time of 18 h. The effect of MG (1, 50 and 500 mg/kg body weight) on intestinal inflammatory reaction induced by V. cholerae was studied by performing histology in Swiss albino mice. MIC and MBC of MG against the test strains were 32-64 and 64-256 μg/ml, respectively. MG showed the fluid accumulation-inhibitory activity with inhibition values of 42.86-89.08% at doses between 23.80 and 95.23 mg/kg body weight and significant anticolonization activity (p < 0.0001) against V. choleare in the suckling mouse intestine. MG (500 mg/kg body weight) significantly inhibited the inflammatory reactions induced by V. cholerae compared to the vehicle control. MG exhibited 70% minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of 64 μg/ml and bacterial membrane damaging activity at 1 × MBC. The results obtained in the present study suggest that MG has potential as an effective agent for the treatment of severe secretory and inflammatory diarrheal disease caused by MDR V. cholerae.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This article investigates the anxiolytic activity of Terminalia chebula tannin-rich extract against picrotoxin (PTX; GABA antagonist)-induced anxiety in mice model. METHODS: Anxiolytic activity was studied by elevated plus maze (EPM), open field test (OFT), light/dark box test (LDT) and Vogel's conflict test (VCT). Electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed to know the changes in brain activity instigated by GABA antagonist. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine and norepinephrine levels in brain tissues were estimated by HPLC. The mRNA (CREB, BDNF, GABA, and 5-HT1A ) and protein expression (CREB, p-CREB, BDNF, ERK ½, p-ERK ½, GABAA Rα1, 5-HT1A and GAPDH) levels in brain tissue were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Terminalia chebula tannin-rich extract (TCHE) supplementation increased locomotion in mice towards open arm (EPM), time spent in illuminated area (LDT), rearing frequency (OFT) and number of shocks (VCT) compared to PTX (P < 0.05). Furthermore, TCHE down-regulated serum cortisol levels and showed increased levels of 5-HT, DA and NE. Gene expressions such as BDNF, CREB, GABAA and 5-HT1A were up-regulated by TCHE treatment compared to PTX. CONCLUSIONS: Terminalia chebula tannin-rich extract showed significant anxiolytic activity against picrotoxin and could be used as natural therapy in neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "Teminalia chebula (TC) has been traditionally used in the Iranian traditional medicine (ITM) and Ayurvedic medicine primarily for neurologic disorders and inflammation. Mainly, its fruits have been applied for CNS disorders. The effects of Terminalia chebula as herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties were aimed on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial inflammation. Cytotoxicity of TC extract (0-80) µg/ml on microglial cells was evaluated using the MTT assay. Also, the protective effect of TC extract concentrations with specified amount of LPS-induced mice microglial cells was studied. The concentrations of TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α), IL-1β (Interleukin-1β), IL-6 and PGE-2 (Prostaglandin-E2) were evaluated using ELISA. Gene expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2 (Cyclooxygenase-2), iNOS and arginase-1 was also evaluated using the Real-Time PCR method. Nitrite oxide and urea were measured using biochemical methods. The studied concentrations of TC extract did not affect the viability of microglial cells but significantly protected the viability after treatment with LPS. The concentrations and expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, PGE-2, COX-2) were significantly decreased after TC extract treatment in LPS-induced microglial cells with dose dependent manner. The extract also significantly decreased the levels of nitric oxide, increased urea and down regulated the expression of nitric oxide synthesis while arginase-1 expression was enhanced. Our results suggest that TC extract reduces inflammation in microglial cells and can be used as a potential anti-inflammatory agent in central nervous system inflammatory diseases.",

(Combretaceae) is a traditional herbal medicine that is widely used in the treatment of diabetes, immunodeficiency diseases, and stomach ulcer in Asia. However, the anti-amnesic effect of T. chebula has not yet been investigated. The present study was designed to determine whether T. chebula extract (TCE) alleviates amnesia induced by scopolamine in mice. We also investigated possible mechanisms associated with cholinergic system and anti-oxidant effects. METHODS: TCE (100 or 200 mg/kg) was orally administered to mice for fourteen days (days 1-14), and scopolamine was intraperitoneally injected to induce memory impairment for seven days (days 8-14). Learning and memory status were evaluated using the Morris water maze. Hippocampal levels of acetylcholine (ACh), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were measured ex vivo. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the hippocampus were also examined. RESULTS: In the Morris water maze task, TCE treatment reversed scopolamine-induced learning and memory deficits in acquisition and retention. TCE reduced hippocampal AChE activities and increased ChAT and ACh levels in the scopolamine-induced model. Moreover, TCE treatment suppressed scopolamine-induced oxidative damage by ameliorating the increased levels of ROS, NO, and MDA. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that TCE exerts potent anti-amnesic effects via cholinergic modulation and anti-oxidant activity, thus providing evidence for its potential as a cognitive enhancer for amnesia.",

In vitro toxicity profile of TCF, TAB and 7MG (250-2000 μg/ml) were assessed through cytotoxicity, hemolytic activity, mutagenicity and genotoxicity assays. Results of Ames test, comet assay, MTT and hemolytic assays illustrated that TCF, TAB and 7MG exhibited neither cytotoxic and genotoxic effect in PBMC nor hemolytic activity in RBC and no mutagenic effect in TA 98 and TA 100 up to a limited dose of 2000 μg/ml. Acute and subacute toxicity studies showed no significant change in body weight, behavior, hematology, biochemical parameters, organ weight and histopathology. Over all the results of acute and subacute toxicity studies conclude that oral administration of TCF, TAB and 7MG were observed to be relatively non-toxic and affords practical guidance for selecting safe dose for further clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Terminalia chebula fruits are one of the richest sources of hydrolysable tannins and it is well known medicinal agent in traditional systems of medicine for treatment of various chronic ailments. In the present study, hydrolysable tannin rich fraction (HTF) was isolated from 80% hydroalcoholic extract of Terminalia chebula fruit pericarps and it was studied for acute and repeated dose oral toxicity in Wistar albino rats. HTF did not show any toxic symptoms or mortality at single dose administration of 5000 mg/kg/p.o followed by observation for 14 days. On repeated dose 28 days oral toxicity study, administration of HTF at 1000 mg/kg showed marked reduction in body weight, food intake and water intake when compared with vehicle control. It was also observed that HTF could increase serum urea, glucose and AST level significantly when compared with vehicle control indicating mild disturbances in liver and kidney functions. On histopathological screening, HTF treatment showed a mild granulomatous inflammation in the liver and all other organs remained normal. It was concluded that following 28 days repeated dose oral administration, HTF caused mild disturbances in liver and kidney function which was indicated by reduced body weight, food and water intake, serum parameters and histological observations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by memory loss and impaired cognitive function. Cholinergic enzyme deficiency and oxidative stress are the two major factors implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The symptomatic treatment, as of now, is the use of cholinesterase inhibitors toward cholinergic \"downturn.\" Therefore, there is a search for compounds that will be useful in focused therapies. There has been suggestion that Terminalia chebula fruit would be a potential source. OBJECTIVE: To assess the anticholinesterase and antioxidant activities of T. chebula fruit which is widely practiced in the Ayurvedic medicines for memory enhancement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethyl acetate extract of T. chebula fruit (TCEA) was subjected to phytochemical investigation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory activities and cell-free antioxidant activity. TCEA was further subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrum (GC-MS) analysis. The bioactive compounds were analyzed for molecular docking with AChE and BuChE proteins. RESULTS: TCEA exhibited potent AChE and BuChE inhibitory activities comparable to the standard drug donepezil. In vitro cell-free antioxidant assays demonstrated that TCEA possesses excellent free radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and potent metal-chelating activity. Total polyphenolic content of TCEA was 596.75 ± 0.35 µg gallic acid equivalents/mg of extract, which correlates with the antioxidant activity of TCEA. Molecular docking of compounds expounded in GC-MS analysis for AChE and BuChE enzyme activities revealed that methyl N-(N-benzyloxycarbonyl-beta-l-aspartyl)-beta-d-glucosaminide as the most potent compound with good predicted activities. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results revealed that the bioactive molecule methyl N-(N-benzyloxycarbonyl-beta-l-aspartyl)-beta-d-glucosaminide present in TCEA is a potential depressant for the treatment of AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. SUMMARY: The present study was carried out to assess the neuroprotective effect of Terminalia chebula fruit and its phytoconstituent. Phytochemical analysis of fruit ethyl acetate extract of T. chebula (TCEA) showed the presence of alkaloid, cardiac glycoside, and tannin. TCEA showed potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory activities when compared to standard drug donepezil. Results of in vitro antioxidant assays revealed excellent free radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and potent metal-chelating activity. Gas chromatography-mass spectrum analysis illustrated the presence of 22 active compounds, among which methyl N-(N-benzyloxycarbonyl-beta-l-aspartyl)-beta-d-glucosaminide exhibited potent AChE and BuChE inhibition analyzed through in silico studies.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of the hydroalcoholic extract of Terminalia chebula, on some biochemical and histopathological parameters of liver tissue in diazinon-administered rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats were orally administered with 25 mg/kg body weight diazinon. Vehicle (distilled water) and silymarin (50 mg/kg body weight) were used as the negative and positive control groups, respectively. Diazinon-administered groups were treated with T.chebula (Terminalia chebula) fruit extract (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg). After 15 days of treatment, the blood specimens and liver samples were examined. RESULTS: In diazinon-treated group, the levels of serum urea, high density lipoprotein (HDL), and liver superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and vitamin C significantly decreased (p<0.05) compared to control. Also, in this group, serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL), protein carbonyl (PC), malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and TNF-α gene expression significantly increased (p<0.05) as compared to the control (vehicle-treated rats). Treatment with T. chebula resulted in a significant increase (p<0.05) in CAT, SOD, vitamin C, HDL and a significant decrease (p<0.05) in the level of urea, MDA, PC, TG, TC, VLDL, TNF-α protein, and the gene expression of TNF-α compared with test without treatment group. Histopathological evidence demonstrated that treatment with T. chebula extract could decrease liver lymphocyte infiltration. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that T. chebula fruit extract has protective effects against diazinon-induced oxidative stress."

The fruit of Terminalia chebula has been used extensively in various traditional health systems for different ailments, with additional preclinical and clinical data demonstrating antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a standardized aqueous extract of Terminalia chebula fruit (AyuFlex®) dietary supplementation on joint mobility, comfort, and functional capacity in healthy overweight subjects. METHODS: One-hundred and five (105) overweight, apparently healthy male and female subjects (35-70 years of age) were pre-screened and randomized to one of three groups for 84 days: placebo, AyuFlex1 (250 mg twice daily) or AyuFlex2 (500 mg twice daily) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. A two-week placebo lead-in period was used to improve data quality/validity. All subjects had no knee joint discomfort at rest, but experienced knee joint discomfort only with activity/exercise of at least 30 on 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Primary outcome measures included symptoms of joint health and function as measured by modified-Knee Injury & Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (mKOOS) global & modified-Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (mWOMAC) subscales (discomfort, stiffness and function). Secondary outcomes included VAS questionnaires on overall/whole-body joint health, low back health, knee mobility, willingness and ability to exercise, 6-min walk test for distance and range of motion (ROM) of pain-free knee flexion/extension. Tertiary outcome measures included inflammatory (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) and extracellular matrix (ECM)/Connective Tissue (COMP) biomarkers, and safety (vital signs and blood markers) & tolerability (Adverse Event (AE)/ side effect profiles). RESULTS: Compared to placebo, at day 84 AyuFlex® treatment significantly: 1) improved mKOOS global scores in AyuFlex1 + AyuFlex2 (P = 0.023), and improved total and physical function subscale of mWOMAC relative to baseline, 2) improved VAS scores for Knee Discomfort with activity/exercise in AyuFlex1 + AyuFlex2 (P = 0.001) relative to baseline, 3) improved VAS scores for whole-body joint function in AyuFlex1 + AyuFlex2 (P < 0.029) relative to baseline, 4) improved VAS score for decreased knee joint soreness following leg extension challenge for AyuFlex1 (P = 0.022) and AyuFlex2 (P = 0.043) relative to baseline, 5) improved 6-min walk performance distance covered (P = 0.047) and VAS discomfort (P = 0.026) post-6 min walk in AyuFlex1 + AyuFlex2 relative to baseline, 6) and tended to decrease COMP levels in AyuFlex1 + AyuFLex2 (P = 0.104) relative to baseline. All biomarkers of safety remained within normative limits during the study. Low back health tended to improve in the AyuFlex1 and AyuFlex2 group, but failed to reach significance relative to placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: AyuFlex® improved mKOOS global scores, knee joint discomfort with activity/exercise, 6-min walk test distance covered and discomfort post-6 min walk test, overall whole-body joint function, knee soreness following leg extension resistance exercise in a healthy, overweight population, without AE. Differences between 250 mg/BID and 500 mg/BID were non-significant for most of the outcome measures, validating the efficacy of the lower dose.

      "abstract": "Chebulinic acid, an ellagitannin found in the fruits of Terminalia chebula, has been extensively used in traditional Indian system of medicine. It has shown to have various biological activities including antitumor activity. The present study aims to investigate the cytotoxic potential of chebulinic acid in human myeloid leukemia cells. Interestingly, chebulinic acid caused apoptosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and NB4 cells but not K562 cells. In vitro antitumor effects of chebulinic acid were investigated by using various acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Chebulinic acid treatment to HL-60 and NB4 cells induced caspase activation, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and changes in the mitochondrial membrane permeability. Additionally, inhibition of caspase activation drastically reduced the chebulinic acid-induced apoptosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Our data also demonstrate that chebulinic acid-induced apoptosis in HL-60 and NB4 cells involves activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, which, when inhibited with ERK inhibitor PD98059, mitigates the chebulinic acid-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings exhibit the selective potentiation of chebulinic acid-induced apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The resistance to chemical insecticides among mosquito species has been considered as a setback in vector control. Mosquito control programs, botanical origin may have the potential to eliminate eggs and larvae. So, the larvicidal and ovicidal activities of crude benzene, hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform and methanol extracts of Terminalia chebula were assayed for their toxicity against three important vector mosquitoes, viz., Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. The larval mortality was observed after 24 h of exposure. All extracts showed moderate larvicidal effects; however, the highest larval mortality was found in the methanol extract of T. chebula against the larvae of A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus with the LC50 values were 87.13, 93.24 and 111.98 ppm, respectively. Mean percent hatchability of the ovicidal activity was observed 48 h post treatment. The percent hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract and directly proportional to the eggs. All the five solvent extracts showed moderate ovicidal activity; however, the maximum egg mortality (zero hatchability) was observed in the methanol extract of T. chebula at 200 and 250 ppm against A. stephensi, A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus showed 100% mortality at 300 ppm. No mortality was recorded in the control. The finding of the present investigation revealed that the leaf extract of Terminalia chebula possesses remarkable larvicidal and ovicidal activity against medically important vector mosquitoes and make this plant product promising as an alternative to synthetic insecticide in mosquito control programs."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the hypo-testicular activity of aqueous extracts of Terminalia chebula (fruit) and Musa balbisiana (seed) separately, and in composite manner at the ratio of 1:1 named as 'Contracept-TM' compared to cyproterone acetate (CPA), for developing a polyherbal contraceptive. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The separate extract of above said plants or 'Contracept-TM' at the dose of 40 mg/100 g body weight of rat/day or CPA at 2 mg/100 g body weight of rat/day was administered for 28 days. Spermiological, androgenic and oxidative stress sensors, LD50 and ED50/100 g body weight values were measured. RESULTS: Treatment of individual, 'Contracept-TM' or CPA resulted significant decrease in the count of spermatogonia A (36.36-49.09%), pre-leptotene spermatocyte (19.11-55.30%), mid-pachytene spermatocyte (28.65-47.28%) and step 7 spermatid (29.65-51.59%). Activities of testicular Δ5, 3β (21.25-48.02%),17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (29.75-55.08%), catalase (19.06-43.29%) and peroxidase (30.76-62.82%), levels of testosterone (28.15-63.44%), testicular cholesterol (19.61-49.33%), conjugated diene (29.69-84.99%) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (41.25-86.73%) were elevated compare to the control. The ED50 and LD50 values were 40 mg and 5.8 g (T. chebula), 48 mg and 6.3 g (M. bulbisiana), 40 mg and 6.0 g ('Contracept-TM'), respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The said spermiological and androgenic sensors' levels were decreased significantly by 'Contracept-TM' than its constitutional individual plant extract and it may be comparable to standard anti-testicular drug like CPA. So, it may be concluded that above polyherbal formulation is potent for inducing hypo-testicular activity.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the neuroprotective effect and mechanisms of action underlying the Terminalia chebula extracts and ellagic acid by using beta-amyloid25-35 (Aβ25-35)-induced cell toxicity in an undifferentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The T. chebula extracts were prepared using the methanol, water, and 95% ethanol. Specifically, the ellagic acid was obtained in our laboratory. Assays including cell toxicity and changes in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium level were evaluated to examine the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of the T. chebula extracts and ellagic acid. RESULTS: The methanolic and water extracts of T. chebula and ellagic acid exhibited the strongest neuroprotective activity against Aβ25-35-induced PC12 cell damages at 0.5-5.0 μg/ml. The ellagic acid also exhibited partial neuroprotective activity against H2O2-induced PC12 cell damages at 0.5-5.0 μg/ml. The methanolic and water extracts of T. chebula and ellagic acid protected PC12 cells from Aβ25-35-mediated cell damages and enhanced cell viability thorough two key mechanisms by: (1) inhibiting ROS production and (2) reducing calcium ion influx. CONCLUSION: The T. chebula represents a promising plant-source as medicine in the application for the treatment of AD. Further investigation focusing on the active component of T. chebula extracts e.g., ellagic acid is crucial to verify the neuroprotective efficacy and mechanisms in vivo.",

Recent studies showed that Terminalia chebula has several pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. The aim of this study was evaluation of the protective effect of T. chebula alcoholic extract (TCAE) on oxidative PC12 and OLN-93 cells death induced by QA. METHODS: The cells were pretreated with TCAE (6.25-50μg/mL) for 2h and then subjected to QA (8mM) for 24h. Cell viability and the parameters of redox status including the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were measured using 2-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT), 2,7-dicholorofluorecin diacetate (DCF-DA), thiobarbituric acid and comet assays, respectively. RESULTS: Based on Folin-Ciocalteu method, the total phenolic compounds in TCAE were estimated about 1.18%. TCAE at concentration ranges of 6.25-50μg/mL had no toxic effect on cell viability (p>0.05). Treatment with TCAE significantly increased cell viability following QA insult at concentrations above 25μg/mL (p<0.01). Cytoprotective potential of TCAE also ameliorated ROS accumulation, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage induced by QA. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that TCAE exhibits neuroprotection and oligoprotection potential by means of alleviating oxidative stress parameters.",

The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate possible antibiofilm efficacy of a gallotannin 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranose from Terminalia chebula fruits alone and in combination with gentamicin and trimethoprim against preformed biofilms of multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogenic E. coli isolates using microbroth dilution, checkerboard titration and kill kinetics methods. Test gallotannin showed > 50% antibiofilm efficacy after 24 h when administered alone whereas gentamicin and trimethoprim failed to do so. But in combination, test gallotannin/gentamicin and test gallotannin/trimethoprim showed 71.24±6.75% and 93.4±8.46% antibiofilm activity respectively. On the basis of FICI values, test gallotannin/gentamicin showed synergistic interactions against 71.42% and test gallotannin/trimethoprim against 85.71% biofilm forming test bacterial isolates. Kill-kinetics study confirmed their synergistic interactions. Thus, gentamicin and trimethoprim in combination with test gallotannin may have potential for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by biofilm forming MDR uropathogenic E. coli.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: From the oral health perspective, it is well established that microorganisms have an important role in caries aetiology. From the dawn of civilization, herbal plants have served an array of roles. Triphala a tradtional herbal Ayurvedic formula consists of three native fruits of india including Terminalia Chebula (T. chebula), Terminalia Bellirica (T. bellirica) and Embilica Officinalis (E. officinalis). As per Ayurvedic Formulary of India (AFI) Triphala is prepared by combining a 1:1:1 mixture of ground dry fruits called myrobalans. Till date, an inadequate number of clinical researches on herb based mouth rinses have been reported in Asia, especially in India and other Southeast Asian countries (where these products are most accepted and widely used). The present study was planned to assess the effectiveness of Triphala with its three constituents. AIM: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Triphala, T. chebula, T. bellirica and E. officinalis aqueous extract rinses separately on Streptococcusmutans count at various time intervals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a double-blind, linear cross over, within group experimental trial conducted among subjects visiting the Department of Public Health Dentistry aged 15 to 40 years. In this design, subjects received all of the treatments sequentially in time. The independent variables to be assessed in this study were all the four interventions of herbal preparations used and the dependent variable assessed is anti bacterial efficacy. Each subject receives two or more different treatments. All the subjects were exposed to all four interventions: 1) T. chebula; 2) T. bellirica; 3) E. officinalis; and 4) Triphala and were provided 15 ml of the freshly prepared 10% rinse. The subjects were instructed not to eat or drink between salivary samples collection. Post rinse unstimulated salivary samples were collected at five minutes and 60 minutes intervals. All the salivary samples were transferred immediately to microbiological laboratory in sterile containers within one hour for microbiological analysis. RESULTS: The mean Colony Forming Units (CFUs) of S. mutans with Triphala when compared to other three intervention was significantly reduced at 5 minutes and 60 minutes (p=0.001). E. officinalis showed least reduction of mean CFUs when compared to other three groups. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that all four rinses were effective in reducing S. mutans CFUs, but 10% Triphala has greater efficacy than its other constituents."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The fruit of the Terminalia chebula tree has been widely used for the treatment of various disorders. Its anti-diabetic, anti-mutagenic, anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral effects have been studied. Dental plaque bacteria (DPB) are intimately associated with gingivitis and periodontitis. In the quest for materials that will prove useful in the treatment and prevention of periodontal disease, we investigated the preventive effects of an ethanol extract of Terminalia chebula (EETC) on DPB-induced inflammation and bone resorption. METHODS: The anti-bacterial effect of EETC was analyzed using the disc diffusion method. The anti-inflammatory effect of EETC was determined by molecular biological analysis of the DPB-mediated culture cells. Prevention of osteoclastic bone resorption by EETC was explored using osteoclast formation and pit formation assays. RESULTS: EETC suppressed the growth of oral bacteria and reduced the induction of inflammatory cytokines and proteases, abolishing the expression of PGE2 and COX-2 and inhibiting matrix damage. By stimulating the DPB-derived lipopolysaccharides, EETC inhibited both osteoclast formation in osteoclast precursors and RANKL expression in osteoblasts, thereby contributing to the prevention of bone resorption. CONCLUSIONS: EETC may be a beneficial supplement to help prevent DPB-mediated periodontal disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Development of new and effective therapeutics for sexually transmitted herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection is important from public health perspective. With an aim to identify natural products from medicinal plants, in the present study, the potential of Terminalia chebula Retz was investigated for its activity against HSV-2. METHODS: Fruits of Terminalia chebula Retz were used to prepare 50% ethanolic extract. In addition, chebulagic acid and chebulinic acid both purified from T. chebula were also used. The extract as well as purified compounds were first used to determine their in vitro cytotoxicity on Vero cells by MTT assay. T. chebula extract, chebulagic acid, chebulinic acid along with acyclovir were subsequently assessed for direct anti-viral activity, and their ability to inhibit attachment and penetration of HSV-2 to the Vero cells. In addition, their anti-HSV-2 activity was also determined by in vitro post-infection plaque reduction assay. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity assay using Vero cells revealed CC50 = 409.71 ± 47.70 μg/ml for the extract whereas chebulagic acid and chebulinic acid showed more than 95% cell viability up to 200 μg/ml. The extract from T. chebula (IC50 = 0.01 ± 0.0002 μg/ml), chebulagic (IC50 = 1.41 ± 0.51 μg/ml) and chebulinic acids (IC50 = 0.06 ± 0.002 μg/ml) showed dose dependent potent in vitro direct anti-viral activity against HSV-2. These also effectively prevented the attachment as well as penetration of the HSV-2 to Vero cells. In comparison, acyclovir showed poor direct anti-viral activity and failed to significantly (p > 0.05) prevent the attachment as well as penetration of HSV-2 to Vero cells when tested upto 50 μg/ml. However, in post-infection plaque reduction assay, T. chebula extract, chebulagic and chebulinic acids showed IC50 values of 50.06 ± 6.12, 31.84 ± 2.64, and 8.69 ± 2.09 μg/ml, respectively, which were much lower than acyclovir (71.80 ± 19.95 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: The results presented herein suggest that T. chebula extract, chebulagic and chebulinic acids have higher direct antiviral activity against HSV-2 and efficacy to inhibit virus attachment and penetration to the host cells as compared to acyclovir. However, acyclovir is more potent to inhibit post-infection virus replication. Hence, T. chebula may be a useful candidate for developing alternative therapy for prevention of sexually transmitted HSV-2 infection. ᅟ.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among women and is the second leading cause of cancer death. Homeopathic medicines are part of the alternative medicines that are given as a supportive therapy in breast cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate the anticancer activity of commercially available homeopathic preparations of Terminalia chebula (TC) and evaluate their nanoparticulate nature. METHODS: Mother tincture (MT) and other homeopathic preparations (3X, 6C and 30C) of TC were tested for their effect on the viability of breast cancer (MDAMB231 and MCF7) and non-cancerous (HEK 293) cell lines by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell growth assay was performed to analyze the effect of the different potencies on the growth kinetics of breast cancer cells. MT and 6C were evaluated for the presence of nanoparticles by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: MT decreased the viability of breast cancer (MDAMB231 and MCF7) and non-cancerous (HEK 293) cells. However, the other potencies (3X, 6C and 30C) decreased the viability of only breast cancer cells without affecting the viability of the non-cancerous cells. All the potencies, MT, 3X, 6C and 30C, reduced growth kinetics of breast cancer cells, more specifically at 1:10 dilution at 24, 48 and 72 h. Under SEM, MT appeared as a mesh-like structure whereas under TEM, it showed presence of nanoclusters. On the other hand, 6C potency contained 20 nm sized nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: The current study reports the anticancer activity of homeopathic preparations of TC against breast cancer and reveals their nanoparticulate nature. These preliminary results warrant further mechanistic studies at both in vitro and in vivo levels to evaluate the potential of TC as nanomedicine in breast cancer.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 110 eligible subjects with hyperuricemia were enrolled and randomized to either of the five treatment groups - T. chebula 500 mg twice a day (BID), T. bellerica 250 mg BID, T. bellerica 500 mg BID, placebo BID, and febuxostat 40 mg once daily plus an identical placebo - for a duration of 24 weeks. Serum uric acid levels were measured at baseline and at the end of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks. Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism Software 4. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: All active treatment groups showed a reduction in serum uric acid levels compared to baseline and placebo. Significant reduction in mean serum uric acid levels started as early as 4 weeks following treatment, compared to baseline, with T. bellerica (500 and 250 mg), febuxostat (P<0.001), and T. chebula 500 mg (P<0.01); an increase in serum uric acid levels was seen with placebo (P<0.05). The serum uric acid levels became steady after 16 weeks of treatment and remained the same until the end of 24 weeks. The reduction of serum uric acid levels in the T. bellerica 500 mg group was nearly twice that of the T. chebula 500 mg group as well as T. bellerica 250 mg group at all time points. T. bellerica 500 mg reduced serum uric acid levels from 8.07±0.87 to 5.78±0.25 compared to febuxostat, which reduced serum uric acid levels from 8.53±0.97 to 4.28±0.67 (P<0.001) at the end of 24 weeks. The efficacy of T. bellerica appeared to be dose dependent. All the formulations were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: T. bellerica has the potential for treating hyperuricemia as it was devoid of any serious adverse effects in the present study. Further studies are needed to confirm this potential."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The galls of Terminala chebula (Gaertn.) Retz. (Combretaceae) are used for the treatment of various diseases in folk medicine and has been found to posses anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-helmintic, anti-tyrosinase, and anti-aging activities. Considering the ethano-botanical and diverse pharmacological applications of galls of T. chebula, in this study, we investigate the possible toxic effects of different gall extracts of T. chebula by Brine shrimp (Artemia salina) toxicity assay. The cytotoxicity test of leaf gall extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, ethanol, and aqueous) of T. chebula was evaluated by Brine shrimp (A. salina) toxicity assay, which is based on the ability to kill laboratory cultured Artemia nauplii (animals eggs) and also total content of polyphenols, flavonoids with other qualitative phytochemical analysis of the extract were determined. It was observed that the petroleum ether extract was virtually nontoxic on the shrimps, and exhibited very low toxicity with LC50 value of 4356.76 μg/ml. Furthermore, the chloroform extract exhibited very low toxicity, giving LC50 value of 1462.2 μg/ml. On the other hand, the ethanol extract was very toxic to brine shrimps with LC50 value of 68.64 μg/ml. The ethanol extract had the highest total phenolic and flavonoid content of 136 ± 1.5 mg of gallic acid equivalent/g d.w and 113 ± 1.6 mg of quercetin equivalent/g d.w, respectively. The higher toxicity effect was positively correlated to the high content of total polyphenols/flavonoids in the extract. This significant lethality of different extracts to brine shrimp is an indicative of the presence of potent cytotoxic components which warrants further investigation. SUMMARY: The present study investigates the toxicity effect of different extracts of galls of T. chebulla, which would serve as an index for formulation of drugs for treatment of various diseases. Presumably, these activities could be attributed in part to the polyphenolic features of the extract, as there was a strong correlation of higher toxic effect with that of high total phenolic and flavonoids content in the ethanolic leaf gall extracts of T. chebula."

      "abstract": "AIMS: In the presence of oxygen, most of the synthesized pyruvate during glycolysis in the cancer cell of solid tumors is released away from the mitochondria to form lactate (Warburg Effect). To maintain cell homeostasis, lactate is transported across the cell membrane by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). The major aim of the current investigation is to identify novel compounds that inhibit lactate efflux that may lead to identifying effective targets for cancer treatment. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, 900 ethanol plant extracts were screened for their lactate efflux inhibition using neuroblastoma (N2-A) cell line. Additionally, we investigated the mechanism of inhibition for the most potent plant extract regarding monocarboxylate transporters expression, and consequences effects on viability, growth, and apoptosis. METHODOLOGY: The potency of lactate efflux inhibition of ethanol plant extracts was evaluated in N2-A cells by measuring extracellular lactate levels. Caspase 3- activity and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining were performed to assess the apoptotic effect. The antiproliferative effect was measured using WST assay. Western blotting was performed to quantify protein expression of MCTs and their chaperone CD147 in treated cells lysates. RESULTS: Terminalia chebula plant extract was the most potent lactate efflux inhibitor in N2-A cells among the 900 - tested plant extracts. The results obtained show that extract of Terminalia chebula fruits (TCE) significantly (P = 0.05) reduced the expression of the MCT1, MCT3, MCT4 and the chaperone CD147. The plant extract was more potent (IC50 of 3.59 ± 0.26 μg/ml) than the MCT standard inhibitor phloretin (IC50 76.54 ± 3.19 μg/ml). The extract also showed more potency and selective cytotoxicity in cancer cells than DI-TNC1 primary cell line (IC50 7.37 ± 0.28 vs. 17.35 ± 0.19 μg/ml). Moreover, TCE Inhibited N2-A cell growth (IG50 = 5.20 ± 0.30 μg/ml) and induced apoptosis at the 7.5 μg/ml concentration. CONCLUSION: Out of the 900 plant extracts screened, Terminalia chebula ethanol extract was found to be the most potent lactate efflux inhibitor with the ability to inhibit chaperone CD147 expression and impact the function of monocarboxylate transporters. Furthermore, TCE was found to have growth inhibition and apoptotic effects. The results obtained indicate that Terminalia chebula constituent(s) may contain promising compounds that can be useful in the management of neuroblastoma cancer."

      "abstract": "Death receptor (DR) ligation elicits two different modes of cell death (necroptosis and apoptosis) depending on the cellular context. By screening a plant extract library from cells undergoing necroptosis or apoptosis, we identified a water extract of Terminalia chebula (WETC) as a novel and potent dual inhibitor of DR-mediated cell death. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms of its anti-necroptotic and anti-apoptotic action revealed that WETC or its constituents (e.g., gallic acid) protected against tumor necrosis factor-induced necroptosis via the suppression of TNF-induced ROS without affecting the upstream signaling events. Surprisingly, WETC also provided protection against DR-mediated apoptosis by inhibition of the caspase cascade. Furthermore, it activated the autophagy pathway via suppression of mTOR. Of the WETC constituents, punicalagin and geraniin appeared to possess the most potent anti-apoptotic and autophagy activation effect. Importantly, blockage of autophagy with pharmacological inhibitors or genetic silencing of Atg5 selectively abolished the anti-apoptotic function of WETC. These results suggest that WETC protects against dual modes of cell death upon DR ligation. Therefore, WETC might serve as a potential treatment for diseases characterized by aberrantly sensitized apoptotic or non-apoptotic signaling cascades.",

Although a variety of antibiotics have been effective for treatment of shigellosis, options are becoming limited due to globally emerging drug resistance. In the present study, in vitro antibacterial activity of methyl gallate (MG) isolated from Terminalia chebula was determined by performing MIC, minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill kinetic studies. Bacterial membrane-damaging activity of MG was determined by membrane perturbation and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cellular drug accumulation, cell infection and assessment of intracellular activities of MG and reference antibiotics were performed using HeLa cell cultures. The bactericidal activity of MG against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Shigella spp. in comparison with other commonly used drugs including fluoroquinolone was demonstrated here. TEM findings in the present study revealed that MG caused the total disintegration of inner and outer membranes, and leakage of the cytoplasmic contents of S. dysenteriae. The level of accumulation of MG and tetracycline in HeLa cells incubated for 24  h was relatively higher than that of ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (ratio of intracellular concentration/extracellular concentration of antibiotic for MG and tetracycline>ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid). The viable number of intracellular S. dysenteriae was decreased in a time-dependent manner in the presence of MG (4 × MBC) and reduced to zero within 20  h. The significant intracellular activities of MG suggested that it could potentially be used as an effective antibacterial agent for the treatment of severe infections caused by MDR Shigella spp.",

METHODS: Five groups of ten rats were burned with hot water. Animals were administrated with topical cream at control, normal saline, 5%, 10% T. chebula extracts and standard SSD creams. Several parameters were assessed, including wound area, visual inspection of wound, bacteriology assessment, percentage of wound contraction and histopathological examination. RESULTS: The average area of wound on 10th day was 11.2 ± 3.3, 11 ± 3.2, 8.5 ± 2.3, 9.5 ± 4.2 and 5.1 ± 2.2 cm(2) for SSD1%, base cream, normal saline, herbal extract 5% and 10%, respectively. T. chebula 10% cream exhibited lower wound size than SSD1% and control groups at 10th day post burn injury. On day 15, the percentage of wound contraction in T. chebula was 5% and 10% more than 18% and 53% in comparison to SSD1% group, respectively. Histopathological results exhibited well-formed horizontally oriented collagen fibers for appropriate tension. Strength of scar on burned tissue was better in T. chebula 5% and 10% as compared with control and SSD groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that T. chebula extract was capable of accelerating wound healing in rats by wound contraction, and had beneficial effects more than SSD 1% cream in the management of burn injury.",

Although there are a large number of anti-hyperlipidemic drugs available, unfortunately, they all have side effects. OBJECTIVE: Terminalia chebula Retz. (Combretaceae) is a plant used to treat cardiac disorders in the traditional Ayurveda medicine in India. The objective of this study was to assess the anti-hyperlipidemic properties of a methanol (MeOH) bark extract of T. chebula. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acute toxicity studies were performed according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guideline no. 423 using various doses (5, 50, 300, and 2000 mg/kg) of T. chebula bark. Anti-hyperlipidemic effect of MeOH bark extract of T. chebula at doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg and fasting glucose levels after treatment with MeOH bark extract of T. chebula at doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg were analyzed using commercially available kits. RESULTS: Acute toxicity studies did not show any morbidity and mortality at various doses. The MeOH extract of T. chebula bark at doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg significantly lowered serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Moreover, the extract of T. chebula and the positive control atorvastatin-treated groups of animals showed a significant increase in the serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in diet-induced hypercholesterolemic animals. CONCLUSION: The overall results confirm that the bark extract of T. chebula possesses significant anti-hyperlipidemic activity.",

The inflammation in mouse peritoneal macrophages was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Animal models were established by using ear swelling and paw edema of mouse induced by xylene and formaldehyde, respectively. In vitro, cytotoxicity, the phagocytosis of macrophages, the levels of nitric oxide (NO), induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cell supernatant were detected. In vivo, swelling rate and edema inhibitory rate of ear and paw were observed using CM-treated mice. Results. At 150-18.75 μg·mL(-1), CM had no cytotoxicity and could significantly promote the growth and the phagocytosis of macrophages and inhibit the overproduction of NO, iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-6 in macrophages induced by LPS. In vivo, pretreatment with CM, the ear swelling, and paw edema of mice could be significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, and the antiedema effect of CM at high dose was better than dexamethasone. Conclusion. Our results demonstrated that Coptis chinensis and myrobalan possessed synergistically anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and in vivo, which indicated that CM had therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of inflammation-mediated diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Free radicals are implicated in several metabolic diseases and the antioxidant therapy has gained an utmost importance in the treatment. The medicinal properties of plants have been investigated and explored for their potent antioxidant activities to counteract metabolic disorders. In this study, the chemical composition and free radical scavenging potential of leaf gall extracts (ethanol, petroleum ether, chloroform and aqueous) of Terminelia chebula is evaluated, which is extensively used in the preparation of traditiona medications to treat various metabolic diseases. METHODS: The presences of phenolics, flavonoids, triterpens, saponins, glycosides, phytosterols, reducing sugars were identified in the extracts according to standard procedures. The free radical scavenging activities of the extract were also analysed by standard procedures. RESULTS: The methanol extract had the highest total phenolic and flavonoid content. The antioxidant activities of leaf gall extracts were examined using diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Super oxide radical scavenging, Hydroxyl scavenging and ferric reducing power (FRAP) methods. In all the methods, the ethanolic extract showed higher free radical scavenging potential than all the other extracts. CONCLUSIONS: As the higher content of both total phenolics and flavonoids were found in the ethanolic extract, so the significantly high antioxidant activity can be positively correlated to the high content of total polyphenols/flavonoids of the ethanol extract. The results of this study confirm the folklore use of T. chebula leaves gall extracts as a natural antioxidant and justify its ethnobotanical use. Further, the results of antioxidant properties encourage the use of T. chebula leave gall extracts for medicinal health, functional food and nutraceutical applications.",

      "abstract": "The thiazolidinedione (TZDs) class of drugs are very effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). But due to the adverse effects of synthetic TZDs, their use is strictly regulated. The therapeutic actions of TZDs are mediated via modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Naturally occurring PPARγ modulators are more desirable as they lack the serious adverse effects caused by TZDs. This has prompted the exploitation of medicinal plants used in traditional medicine, for their potential PPARγ activity. In the present work, we studied chebulagic acid (CHA) isolated from fruits of Terminalia chebula with respect to its effect on adipogenesis, glucose transport, and endocrine function of adipocyte. The mRNA expression profile of PPARγ target gene CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP-α) was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The putative binding mode and the potential ligand-target interactions of CHA, with PPARγ was analyzed using docking software (Autodock and iGEMDOCKv2). The results showed that CHA enhances PPARγ signaling and adipogenesis dose dependently but in a moderate way, less than rosiglitazone. GLUT4 expression and adiponectin secretion was increased by CHA treatment. The mRNA expression of PPARγ target gene C/EBP-α was increased in CHA -treated adipocytes. The comparison of results of various parameters of adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, endocrine function and molecular docking experiments of roziglitazone and chebulagic acid indicate that the latter behaves like partial PPARγ agonist which could be exploited for phytoceutical development against T2DM.",

In this study, the curative effect and mechanism of action of the polyphenolic extracts from Punica granatum L. and Terminalia chebula Retz. in chickens challenged with APEC were studied. Specific-pathogen-free white Leghorn chickens (males, 21-d old) were challenged with APEC and then given oral administration of extracts of P. granatum and T. chebula. The extracts decreased the morbidity and inflammation induced by APEC. Data from quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the extracts of P. granatum and T. chebula polyphenols (GCP) reversed the over-expression genes of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, 4, and 5, down-regulated the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B signal transduction pathways, and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Most of the approved anti cancer drugs have a natural product origin or are natural products. Retinoblastoma is the most common ocular cancer of children. Although chemotherapy is the preferred mode of therapy, a successful treatment for retinoblastoma requires enucleation. Chebulagic acid (CA) from Terminalia chebula was shown to have anti-proliferative properties in the studies on cancerous cell lines. Due to anti cancer properties of CA and due to limitation in treatment options for retinoblastoma, the present study is undertaken to understand the role of CA on the proliferation of retinoblastoma cells. METHODS: Anti proliferative potential of CA was determined by MTT assay. The expression levels of various cell death mediators in retinoblastoma cells with CA treatment were assessed by Western blotting. Flowcytometer analysis was used to estimate the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and to determine the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. RESULTS: The present study showed CA inhibited the proliferation of retinoblastoma cells in a dose dependent manner. CA modulated MMP, induced release of Cytochrome c, activated caspase 3 and shifted the ratio of BAX and Bcl2 towards cell death. G1 arrest, noticed in CA treated cells, is mediated by the increase in the expression of CDK inhibitor p27. CA treatment also decreased the levels of NFκB in the nucleus. This decrease is mediated by suppression in degradation of IκBα. CONCLUSION: CA has shown significant anti proliferative potential on retinoblastoma cells. Our findings clearly demonstrate that CA induces G1 arrest, inhibits NFκB and induces apoptosis of retinoblastoma cells.",

DPPH assay further confirmed the free-radical scavenging ability of the extracts which increased with the increase in concentration of each extract. Cell proliferation/apoptosis, cytoskeletal structure, and ECM production were further evaluated by live-dead assay and phalloidin/cytokeratin staining, respectively. The cytoskeletal structure and ECM secretion of the cells treated with extracts showed higher cellular activity in comparison to control. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the effect of these extracts of T. chebula on both types of skin cells and optimized concentration in which it could be used as a bioactive component for wound healing applications by increasing cell proliferation and decreasing free-radical production without affecting the normal cellular matrix. It can also find applications in other therapeutics applications where ammonia toxicity is a limiting factor."

Safety profile of Terminalia chebula was established by determining LD50 and acute neurotoxicity. The result showed that extract of Terminalia chebula dose dependently suppressed SO2 gas induced cough in mice. Terminalia chebula, after i.p. administration at dose level 500 mg/kg, offered maximum cough suppressive effects; that is, number of coughs at 60 min was 12 ± 1.52 (mean ± SEM) as compared to codeine 10 mg/kg; i.p., dextromethorphan 10 mg/kg; i.p., and saline, having frequency of cough 10.375 ± 0.866, 12.428 ± 0.81, and 46 ± 2.61, respectively. LD50 value of Terminalia chebula was approximately 1265 mg/kg, respectively. No sign of neural impairment was observed at antitussive doses of extract. Antitussive effect of Terminalia chebula was partly reversed with treatment by naloxone (3 mg/kg; s.c.) while rimcazole (3 mg/kg; s.c.) did not antagonize its cough suppression activity. This may suggest that opioid receptors partially contribute in antitussive action of Terminalia chebula. Along with this, the possibility of presence of single or multiple mechanisms activated by several different pharmacological actions (mainly anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, spasmolytic, antibacterial, and antiphlegmatic) could not be eliminated."

OBJECTIVE: This work was undertaken to evaluate the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-lipid peroxidative and membrane-stabilizing effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Terminalia chebula fruits and also to establish a possible association between them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo anti-inflammatory activity of T. chebula fruit extract at different doses ranged from 50 to 500 mg/kg, p.o. was evaluated against carrageenin-induced inflammation in rats. Human erythrocyte hemolytic assay was used for in vitro anti-inflammatory activity testing with 50 to 500 µg/ml fruit extract. Antioxidant potential of test fruit extract (10 to 100 µg/ml) was evaluated using TBARS and DPPH methods. The fruit extract was standardized for total phenolic content using Folin-Ciocalteu method. RESULTS: The standardized extract at 250 mg/kg, p.o. dose caused 69.96% reduction in carrageenin-induced rat paw edema and demonstrated 96.72% protective effect on human RBC membrane stability. Besides, T. chebula fruit extract significantly reduced the in vivo formation of TBARS in carrageenin-induced rat liver with IC50 94.96 mg/kg, p.o. and also in vitro radical scavenging activities in DPPH assay method with IC50 42.14 µg/ml. The standardized extract contains phenolics 118.5 mg gallic acid equivalent/g of extract. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These promising findings support the traditional use of T. chebula fruits in the treatment of arthritic disorders and suggest that radical quenching may be one of the mechanisms for its anti-inflammatory activity.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Bioassay-guided fractionation and extensive spectrometric analyses (FT-IR, (1) H NMR, (13) C NMR and ESI-MS) were used to isolate and characterize the bioactive compound. Growth inhibitory activities of isolated compound were studied by agar well diffusion and microbroth dilution assay methods. Checkerboard titration method was used for combination study between antibiotics and isolated compound. Influence of metal ions on growth inhibitory activity of this bioactive compound against the test isolates were also studied by INT [P-iodonitrotetrazolium violet; 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride] colorimetric assay. The isolated bioactive compound 1, 2, 6-tri-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranose was found to be responsible for antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant uropathogens and showed synergy with trimethoprim and gentamicin. This antibacterial activity of bioactive compound was counteracted by the supplementation of iron in the medium. CONCLUSION: Terminalia chebula fruit extract contains bioactive compound effective against multidrug-resistant uropathogens, and this antibacterial activity may be due to its iron-complexing property. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To the best of our knowledge, the antibacterial activity exhibited by isolated gallotannin against multidrug-resistant uropathogens is first time reported by us. Besides, these promising findings may lead to the development of antimicrobial agents from T. chebula fruits for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by these pathogens.",

Combretaceae), is called the 'King of Medicine' in Tibet and is always listed at the top of the list of 'Ayurvedic Materia Medica' because of its extraordinary power of healing. The whole plant possesses high medicinal value and traditionally used for the treatment of various ailments for human beings. Some of the folklore people used this plant in the treatment of asthma, sore throat, vomiting, hiccough, diarrhea, dysentery, bleeding piles, ulcers, gout, heart and bladder diseases. The plant has been demonstrated to possess multiple pharmacological and medicinal activities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, antiproliferative, radioprotective, cardioprotective, antiarthritic, anticaries, gastrointestinal motility and wound healing activity. But no systematic updated information on the therapeutic effectiveness of Terminalia chebula, a popular herbal remedy in India and South-East Asia has so far been reported. This review highlights an updated information particularly on the phytochemistry and various pharmacological and medicinal properties of Terminalia chebula Retz. and some of its isolated compounds, along with their safety evaluation. This may provide incentive for proper evaluation of the plant as medicinal agent against the human diseases and also to bridge the lacunae in the existing literature and future scope which may offer immense opportunity for researchers engaged in validation of the traditional claims and development of safe and effective botanical medicine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Burgeoning antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has necessitated the development of anti pathogenic agents that can quench acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) mediated QS with least risk of resistance. This study explores the anti quorum sensing potential of T. chebula Retz. and identification of probable compounds(s) showing anti QS activity and the mechanism of attenuation of P. aeruginosa PAO1 virulence factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Methanol extract of T. chebula Retz. fruit showed anti QS activity using Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136. Bioactive fraction (F7), obtained by fractionation of methanol extract using Sephadex LH20, showed significant reduction (p<0.001) in QS regulated production of extracellular virulence factors in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Biofilm formation and alginate were significantly (p<0.05) reduced with enhanced (20%) susceptibility to tobramycin. Real Time PCR of F7 treated P. aeruginosa showed down regulation of autoinducer synthase (lasI and rhlI) and their cognate receptor (lasR and rhlR) genes by 89, 90, 90 and 93%, respectively. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry also showed 90 and 64% reduction in the production of 3-oxo-C(12)HSL and C(4)HSL after treatment. Decrease in AHLs as one of the mechanisms of quorum quenching by F7 was supported by the reversal of inhibited swarming motility in F7-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 on addition of C(4)HSL. F7 also showed antagonistic activity against 3-oxo-C(12)HSL-dependent QS in E. coli bioreporter. C. elegans fed on F7-treated P. aeruginosa showed enhanced survival with LT50 increasing from 24 to 72 h. LC-ESI-MS of F7 revealed the presence of ellagic acid derivatives responsible for anti QS activity in T. chebula extract. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on anti QS activity of T. chebula fruit linked to EADs which down regulate the expression of lasIR and rhlIR genes with concomitant decrease in AHLs in P. aeruginosa PAO1 causing attenuation of its virulence factors and enhanced sensitivity of its biofilm towards tobramycin.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The 70% methanol extract of Terminalia chebula Retz. fruit (TCME) was investigated for its in vitro iron chelating property and in vivo ameliorating effect on hepatic injury of iron overloaded mice. METHODS: The effect of fruit extract on Fe2+-ferrozine complex formation and Fe2+ mediated pUC-18 DNA breakdown was studied in order to find the in vitro iron chelating activity. Thirty-six Swiss Albino mice were divided into six groups of: blank, patient control and treated with 50, 100, 200 mg/kg b.w. of TCME and desirox (standard iron chelator drug with Deferasirox as parent compound). Evaluations were made for serum markers of hepatic damage, antioxidant enzyme, lipid per oxidation and liver fibrosis levels. The reductive release of ferritin iron by the extract was further studied. RESULTS: In vitro results showed considerable iron chelation with IC50 of 27.19 ± 2.80 μg/ml, and a significant DNA protection with [P]50 of 1.07 ± 0.03 μg/ml along with about 86% retention of supercoiled DNA. Iron-dextran injection (i.p.) caused significant increase in the levels of the serum enzymes, viz., alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Bilirubin, which were subsequently lowered by oral administration of 200 mg/kg b.w. dose of the fruit extract by 81.5%, 105.88%, 188.08% and 128.31%, respectively. Similarly, treatment with the same dose of the extract was shown to alleviate the reduced levels of liver antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and non-enzymatic reduced glutathione, by 49.8%, 53.5%, 35.4% and 11% respectively, in comparison to the iron overloaded mice. At the same time, the fruit extract effectively lowered the iron-overload induced raised levels of lipid per oxidation, protein carbonyl, hydroxyproline and liver iron by 49%, 67%, 67% and 26%, respectively, with oral treatment of 200 mg/kg b.w. dose of TCME. The fruit extract also showed potential activity for reductive release of ferritin iron. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Terminalia chebula extract may contain active substances capable of lessening iron overload induced toxicity, and hence possibly be useful as iron chelating drug for iron overload diseases.",

Calcium oxalate (CaOx) has been shown to be the main component of the majority of stones formed in the urinary system of the patients with urolithiasis. The present study evaluates the antilithiatic properties of Terminalia chebula commonly called as ″harad ″ which is often used in ayurveda to treat various urinary diseases including kidney stones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antilithiatic activity of Terminalia chebula was investigated on nucleation and growth of the calcium oxalate crystals. The protective potency of the plant extract was also tested on oxalate induced cell injury of both NRK-52E and MDCK renal epithelial cells. RESULTS: The percentage inhibition of CaOx nucleation was found 95.84 % at 25µg/mL of Terminalia chebula aqueous extract which remained almost constant with the increasing concentration of the plant extract; however, plant extract inhibited CaOx crystal growth in a dose dependent pattern. When MDCK and NRK-52E cells were injured by exposure to oxalate for 48 hours, the aqueous extract prevented the injury in a dose-dependent manner. On treatment with the different concentrations of the plant extract, the cell viability increased and lactate dehydrogenase release decreased in a concentration dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that Terminalia chebula is a potential candidate for phytotherapy against urolithiasis as it not only has a potential to inhibit nucleation and the growth of the CaOx crystals but also has a cytoprotective role.",

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) were performed to assess protein expression and networks, respectively. A comparative proteomic profile was determined in T. chebula extract (50 μg/mL)-treated and control cells; the expressions of β-tubulin, ring finger and CHY zinc finger domain containing 1, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor kinase were significantly down-regulated in T. chebula extract-treated Jurkat cells. Moreover, the molecular basis for the T. chebula extract-dependent protein expression changes in Jurkat cells was determined by IPA. Treatment with the T. chebula extract significantly inhibited nuclear factor-κB activity and affected the proteomic profile of Jurkat cells. The molecular network signatures and functional proteomics obtained in this study may facilitate the evaluation of potential antitumor therapeutic targets and elucidate the molecular mechanism of T. chebula extract-dependent effects in Jurkat cells.",

Arthritis was induced in DBA/1J mice by immunizing bovine type II collagen and mice were treated with NDI10218 daily for 5 weeks after the onset of the disease. NDI10218 reduced the arthritis index and blocked the synovial hyperplasia in a dose-dependent manner. The serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were significantly reduced in mice treated with NDI10218. Production of the inflammatory IL-17, but not immunosuppressive IL-10, was also inhibited in splenocytes isolated from NDI10218-treated arthritis mice. Administration of NDI10218 markedly decreased the number of T cell subpopulations in the regional lymph nodes of the arthritis mice. Finally, NDI10218 reduced the number of abdominal contractions in acetic acid-induced writhing model, suggesting an analgesic effect of this extract. Taken together, these results suggest that NDI10218 can be a new therapeutic candidate for the treatment of rheuma-toid arthritis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Terminalia chebula Retz is traditionally used to relieve constipation. The current study was performed to investigate the pharmacological action of aqueous extract of Terminalia chebula seeds (ATC) in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Terminal pieces of rat ileum were suspended in organ bath containing Tyrode solution. The ileum spontaneous motility frequency and contractility were recorded isotonically. To induce ileal contraction, carbachol and ATC were added to the organ bath. In addition, the effect of hexamethonium, indomethacin, atropine, and verapamil on the ATC-induced ileal contractions was also investigated. The effectiveness of ATC on relieving morphine-induced constipation was investigated in an in vivo study by measuring the faecal number, faecal water content, and intestinal transit ratio. RESULTS: ATC increased the frequency of ileum motility and tension of contraction dose-dependently (P < 0.05). Responses induced by ATC were inhibited by pre-treatment of the tissue with verapamil. The ATC activities were not affected by atropine, hexamethonium, and indomethacin. The faecal number and faecal water content were increased dose-dependently by ATC (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The excitatory effects of ATC on ileal contractile frequency and tension are possibly mediated through Ca(2+) channels activation. The results of the present study support the traditional usage of ATC for the treatment of constipation."
