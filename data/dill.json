      "abstract": "The presence of heavy metals, such as copper and nickel, in the rhizosphere reduces the physiological efficiency and growth of plants. This study evaluated the effects of plum tree biochar levels (0, 15, 30, and 45 g kg-1 soil) with and without copper sulfate (200 mg kg-1 soil), nickel sulfate (400 mg kg-1 soil), and their combination on dill plants in a factorial experiment with a randomized complete block design in three replicates. The results indicated that the presence of copper and nickel in the soil had detrimental effects on the growth and physiological performance of dill. Specifically, copper stress alone reduced biomass by 31%, nickel stress by 27%, and their combined treatment by 37.7%. On the other hand, incorporating biochar into the soil decreased the uptake of heavy metals, oxidative stress, and the production of osmotic regulators in the plants, while enhanced nutrient uptake (N, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Zn), photosynthetic pigments, and plant biomass. Increasing biochar application rate in the soil did not have any additional beneficial effect on growth and physiological characteristics of plants. These results suggest that the low rate of biochar (15 g kg-1) from agricultural wastes is an appropriate soil amendment to remediate copper and nickel pollutants in the rhizosphere to enhance nutrient availability and plant performance. Future research could focus on the long-term efficacy of biochar under diverse field conditions, soil types, and plant species to optimize sustainable agricultural practices.",

A total of 300 healthy rainbow trout (20.70 ± 0.19 g), were fed for 60 days across five treatment groups: control, DEO0.5, DEO1, DEO2 and DEO3. The results revealed that the DEO1 and DEO2 treatments significantly improved the growth performance, intestinal enzymes activities, and serum levels of proteins, lysozyme (LYZ), alternative complement (ACH50), total immunoglobulin (total Ig) and antioxidant defence, compared with those in the control group (p < 0.05). Notably, the levels of mucosal LYZ, total Ig, ACH50 and protease were significantly elevated in the DEO1 and DEO2 treatment groups (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the serum levels of lipids, cytosolic enzymes, glucose and cortisol were significantly lower in the DEO1, DEO2 and DEO3 treatment groups (p < 0.05). The DEO2 treatment group presented the lowest serum levels of stress indicators (cortisol and glucose) and cytosolic enzymes. Additionally, the survival in the DEO treatment groups 14 days after challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) was significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05), with the DEO2 treatment group showing the highest survivorship. Overall, this study indicates that incorporating DEO at concentrations of 1% and 2% into the diet can substantially enhance growth performance, digestive efficiency, biochemical profiles, immune-antioxidant activity, and resistance to A. hydrophila in rainbow trout juveniles."

This research aims to evaluate the impact of various spectra of LED light on essential oil composition and morphological and physiological characteristics of three dill cultivars. LED light treatments included greenhouse light as control (C), blue (B), red (R), red + blue (RB), and white (W). RB light enhanced most physiological indicators investigated in this study, including photosynthetic pigments, phenols, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, electrolyte leakage in the three cultivars of Khomein, Isfahan, and Varamin decreased when exposed to RB light compared with C light. Under RB light, the essential oil contained more dill ether and α-phellandrene than in other light conditions. In general, light treatment with 75% R light and 25% B light had a noticeable impact on enhancing physiological features compared with other light spectrums. α-phellandrene levels increased in the Isfahan and Varamin cultivars under RB and B light conditions. Finally, the RB light and Khomein cultivars improved physiological features, whereas RB and R light in the Varamin and Isfahan cultivars are recommended for more essential oil compositions in functional food production.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Dill (Anethum graveolens L.) is a typical Uyghur medicine. It is traditionally used to treat sticky and stagnant dampness, hiccups and food stagnation, intestinal obstruction, and anorectal diseases. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our study is designed to investigate the potential of alcohol extract from the aerial part of dill in ameliorating ulcerative colitis induced by Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt (DSS) in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, the chemical composition of the aerial part of dill was speculated from the data obtained by LC-MS and determined by comparing with 10 standards through HPLC. The aerial part of fresh dill was dried, crushed, sieved, and then extracted with 70% ethanol to obtain DE. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells were used to test the anti-inflammatory activity of DE in vitro. The impact of DE on UC was also studied in vivo. UC was induced by drinking 2.5% DSS to C57BL/6 mice for 6 days. The positive control group received 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) by gavage, and the low and high-dose treatment groups were respectively given 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg of DE by gavage daily for 7 days from the first day. RESULTS: DE significantly reduces the disease activity index (DAI) and colon histopathological damage. DE can also alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation in UC mice by reducing IL-6, IL-1β, MDA, and MPO levels and increasing CAT and GSH levels in colonic tissues. DE can protect the integrity of the colonic mucosal barrier by reducing damage to goblet cells, increasing the levels of mucin MUC2, and regulating the expression of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-1, and Claudin-2. In addition, DE improves the ratio of beneficial and harmful bacteria, thus further alleviating the imbalance of intestinal flora. CONCLUSION: DE has anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and an ameliorative effect on DSS-induced UC in mice by alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation, protecting the integrity of the intestinal barrier, and regulating intestinal flora.",

A combined extract of black sticky rice and dill showed potential in the preclinical state, so we hypothesized that it could provide clinical benefits. A three-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled study was set up to elucidate this issue. Both males and females (18-80 years old) who had experienced transient ischemic attacks or ischemic strokes within the last 5-10 days with an NIHSS score ≤ 7 and received standard treatment were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or capsule containing a combined extract of black sticky rice and dill at a dose of 600 or 1200 mg per day. The safety parameters, movement control, and degree of disability were assessed 1, 2, and 6 weeks after the intervention, and serum stroke biomarkers were assessed at the mentioned time points, except at 2 weeks. After week 1, the high-dose (1200 mg/day) treatment group had improved NIHSSS, VCAM1, and MMP-9. Both S100β and VCAM1 also improved at week 6, while the low-dose treatment group (600 mg/day) only exhibited improved VCAM1. Therefore, a high dose of the developed adjuvant supplement improves stroke recovery by improving motor impairment by reducing endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.",

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine and compare the effect of dates, grape seed and dill seed extracts on the PPH rate in women in the fourth stage of labor. METHODS: Two hundred eligible multiparous women visiting the maternity ward in Hamadan for normal delivery participated in this double-blind parallel-group clinical trial. They were randomly divided into four 50-member groups of experiment (3 groups) and control (1 group). The data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire. In the experimental groups, in addition to routine care and oxytocin administration, the mothers received a capsule containing 15 mg of dill seeds extract or 20 mg of grape seed extract or 5 g of dates extract immediately after the delivery, and then their hemorrhage rates were measured one and two hours after delivery. The control group received routine care, oxytocin, and placebo. Data were analyzed in SPSS 21. RESULTS: The hemorrhage changes in the placebo group were much less than the intervention groups at 1 and 2 hours after delivery, and the four groups had a significant difference in terms of hemorrhage in both hours (p <0.001). The overall difference between the dates extract group and the placebo and grape seed groups was also statistically significant (p <0.05). CONCLUSION: All three extracts of dates, grape seed and dill seeds, especially dates, can be effective in PPH reduction.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegeneration diseases (NDs) are a group of complex diseases primarily characterized by progressive loss of neurons affecting mental function and movement. Oxidative stress is one of the factors contributing to the pathogenesis of NDs, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). These reactive species disturb mitochondrial function and accelerate other undesirable conditions including tau phosphorylation, inflammation, and cell death. Therefore, preventing oxidative stress is one of the imperative methods in the treatment of NDs. To accomplish this, we prepared hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of Anethum graveolens (dill) and identified the major phyto-components (apiol, carvone, and dihydrocarvone) by GC-MS. The extracts and major bioactives were assessed for neuroprotective potential and mechanism in hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell model and other biochemical assays. The dill (extracts and bioactives) provided statistically significant neuroprotection from 0.1 to 30 µg/mL by mitigating ROS levels, restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing lipid peroxidation, and reviving the glutathione ratio. They moderately inhibited acetylcholine esterase (IC50 dill extracts 400-500 µg/mL; carvone 275.7 µg/mL; apiole 388.3 µg/mL), displayed mild anti-Aβ1-42 fibrilization (DHC 26.6%) and good anti-oligomerization activity (>40% by dill-EA, carvone, and apiole). Such multifactorial neuroprotective displayed by dill and bioactives would help develop a safe, low-cost, and small-molecule drug for NDs.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Anethum graveolens (AG), commonly known as dill, is a plant from the Apiaceae family that has been traditionally used as a skin softener and purifying agent in Persian medicine. In a previous study conducted on male rats, dill was found to have anti-inflammatory effects. The current study aimed to examine the efficacy of topical application of Anethum graveolens oil on pruritus severity, skin dryness, sleep quality, and quality of life in patients undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: In the current clinical trial, the participants were randomly assigned to one of these groups: topical AG preparation, sesame oil, or a control group receiving no treatment. The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled. The topical treatment was applied twice a day for one month to areas of the skin affected by pruritus. The outcome measures included the severity of skin dryness, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Duo's Uremic Pruritus Severity Scale, and the Itchy QoL questionnaire. RESULTS: This study involved 106 hemodialysis patients, and after intervention for one month, the medication group had a significantly lower mean score of sleep quality (3.24 ± 2.41) than the placebo (4.54 ± 3.11) and control (5.05 ± 3.21) groups (P=0.032). The mean change in pruritus severity was significantly greater in the medication group (-17.28 ± 8.938) than the placebo (-5.91 ± 5.398) and control (-3.43 ± 3.228) groups (P < 0.001). Moreover, a significant difference was observed in the mean changes in quality of life between the medication, placebo, and control groups, with values of -14.88 ± 7.89, -5.34 ± 4.50, and -1.92 ± 2.86, respectively (P < 0.001). Furthermore, both the medication and placebo groups showed improvement in skin dryness compared to the control group having the values of -1.65 ± 0.91, -1.11 ± 0.79, and -0.38 ± 0.54, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Topical Anethum graveolens preparation significantly improved the sleep quality and quality of life and reduced skin pruritus and dryness in hemodialysis patients. It could be considered as a simple therapeutic modality to control pruritus in hemodialysis patients. This trial is registered with IRCT2017022032671N1."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastroprotective activities of both aqueous and 80% methanol leaf extracts of S. abyssinica in experimental rats. METHODS: Decoction and maceration techniques were used to prepare aqueous and 80% methanol leaf extracts, respectively. The extracts were evaluated against pyloric ligation, indomethacin, and ethanol-induced gastric ulcer models at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg. Negative control received 2% tween 80, while positive controls received 20 mg/kg of omeprazole and 100 µg/kg of misoprostol. Parameters, such as ulcer index, gastric mucin content, gastric juice volume, pH, and free and total acidity were measured. RESULTS: In the pyloric ligation induced gastric ulcer model, all doses of both extracts significantly reduced the ulcer index and gastric juice volume, while doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg exhibited a significant increment in mucus content and gastric juice pH as well as decrease in free and total acidity as compared to negative control. In indomethacin and ethanol induced gastric ulcer models, pretreatment with both extracts significantly reduced the ulcer index and enhanced gastric mucin content in a dose-dependent manner. Phytochemical screening of both extracts showed the existence of flavonoids, phenols, tannins, saponins, alkaloids, and coumarins with high contents of phenols, flavonoids, and alkaloids in 80% methanol extract. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that aqueous and 80% methanol leaf extracts of S. abyssinica possessed remarkable gastroprotective activities against experimentally induced gastric ulcer models, and this possibly justify the traditional use of S. abyssinica leaves to treat gastritis."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Elastic skin fibers lose their mechanical properties during aging due to enzymatic degradation, lack of maturation, or posttranslational modifications. Dill extract has been observed to increase elastin protein expression and maturation in a 3D skin model, to improve mechanical properties of the skin, to increase elastin protein expression in vascular smooth muscle cells, to preserve aortic elastic lamella, and to prevent glycation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to highlight dill actions on elastin fibers during aging thanks to elastase digestion model and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: In this study, elastic fibers produced by dermal fibroblasts in 2D culture model were injured by elastase, and we observed the action of dill extract on elastic network by elastin immunofluorescence. Then action of dill extract was examined on mice skin by injuring elastin fibers by intradermal injection of elastase. Then elastin fibers were observed by second harmonic generation microscopy, and their functionality was evaluated by oscillatory shear stress tests. In order to understand mechanism by which dill acted on elastin fibers, enzymatic tests and real-time qPCR on cultured fibroblasts were performed. RESULTS: We evidence in vitro that dill extract is able to prevent elastin from elastase digestion. And we confirm in vivo that dill extract treatment prevents elastase digestion, allowing preservation of the cutaneous elastic network in mice and preservation of the cutaneous elastic properties. Although dill extract does not directly inhibit elastase activity, our results show that dill extract treatment increases mRNA expression of the endogenous inhibitor of elastase, elafin. CONCLUSION: Dill extract can thus be used to counteract the negative effects of elastase on the cutaneous elastic fiber network through modulation of PI3 gene expression.",

This research was conducted to determine the effects of biochar (30 g kg-1 soil) and biochar-based nanocomposites (BNCs) of iron (30 g BNC-FeO kg-1 soil), zinc (30 g BNC-ZnO kg-1 soil), and their combined form (15 + 15 g) on dill (Anethum graveolens L.) under salinity levels (non-saline, 6 and 12 dS m-1). Application of biochar, particularly BNCs increased iron and zinc content and decreased sodium accumulation in leaf tissues. The seed essential oil content increased under high salinity. Salinity changed the values of major compounds in essential oil and induced the formation of compounds such as alpha,2-dimethylstyrene, cuminyl alcohol, p-cymene, and linalool. Biochar treatments especially BNCs with a higher production of monoterpenes increased the levels of limonene, carvone, apiol, and dillapioll. All extracts showed a considerable DPPH-inhibitory effect with application of BNCs under salinity. The maximum antioxidant activity was observed under high level of salinity with application of the combined form. Therefore, the combined form of nanocomposite was the best treatment to improve the content of basic commercial monoterpenes and consequently antioxidant activity of essential oil in salt-stressed dill plants.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: Different parts of Malvaviscus arboreus Dill. Ex Cav. (M. arboreus) are traditionally used in the West Region of Cameroon to treat many diseases, including epilepsy. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine which part of M. arboreus offers the best anticonvulsant effect, and to assess the acute and sub-acute toxicity of the part of interest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the anticonvulsant effect of the aqueous lyophilisate of the decoction of flowers, leaves, stems and roots of M. arboreus at various doses was evaluated and compared on the model of acute epileptic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (70 mg/kg), injected 1 h after oral administration of the various extracts. Out of these plant parts, the leaves were then selected to prepare the hydroethanolic extract and its anticonvulsant effect against PTZ at the doses of 122.5, 245 and 490 mg/kg, as well as its acute toxicity were compared with those of the aqueous lyophilisate of the leaves. The anticonvulsant effect of the aqueous lyophilisate of M. arboreus leaves was further evaluated on models of acute epileptic seizures induced by picrotoxin (PIC) (7.5 mg/kg), strychnine (STR) (2.5 mg/kg) and pilocarpine (350 mg/kg). The 28 days sub-acute toxicity, as well as the quantitative phytochemistry and the in vitro antioxidant potential (FRAP, DPPH, ABTS+) of the aqueous lyophilisate of the leaves of M. arboreus were also evaluated. RESULTS: M. arboreus leaves showed the best anticonvulsant effect and the aqueous lyophilisate was the best extract. The latter significantly protected the animals against convulsions induced by PTZ (71.43%) (p < 0.01), PIC (57.14%) (p < 0.05) and STR (42%) and had no effect on pilocarpine-induced seizures. Furthermore, it showed no acute or sub-acute toxicity, and revealed a high content of flavonoids, saponins, tannins and alkaloids, and antioxidant activity in vitro. CONCLUSION: The aqueous lyophilisate of the leaves of M. arboreus offers the best anticonvulsant effect on the extraction solvent used, and it would act mainly via a potentiation of the inhibitory systems of the brain (GABA, Glycine). In addition, its richness in bioactive compounds gives it an antioxidant potential, and it is not toxic in acute and sub-acute toxicity. All this justifies at least in part its empirical uses, and makes M. arboreus a candidate for the alternative treatment of epilepsy.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial study, 45 overweight and obese females are randomly assigned to four groups: Pilates training + dill group (PDG) (n = 12), pilates training + placebo group (PPG) (n = 11), dill supplementation group (DG) (n = 11), and placebo group (PG) (n = 11). Participants of PDG and PPG performed pilates training for 6 weeks (60 min, 3 sessions per week). PDG and DG received dill tablet (three times a day, 6 weeks). Anthropometric measurements, glycemic markers, and blood samples were assessed before (pretest) and after (posttest) 6 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: Results showed a significant increase in serum concentrations of nesfatin-1 in PDG compared to pretest (P = 0.001). Differences in the serum concentrations of nesfatin-1 in PDG were greater than PPG, DG, and PG (P = 0.01). Furthermore, results found in significant reduction in serum concentrations of lipocalin-2, body mass index (BMI), and waist-hip ratio (WHR) in PDG, PPG, and DG as compared to pretest (P > 0.05). Fasting glucose plasma (FGP) was significantly decreased in all three intervention groups PDG (P < 0.001), PPG (P < 0.001), and DG (P < 0.001) as compared to pretest. Differences in FGP were significantly higher in PDG than PPG, DG, and PG (P = 0.001). A significant reduction was found for insulin only in PDG after 6 weeks of intervention as compared to pretest (P = 0.03). Insulin resistance significantly decreased in PDG (P = 0.03) and PPG (P = 0.04) as compared to pretest. Body fat percent (BFP) was significantly decreased in PDG (P = 0.003), PPG (P = 0.006), and DG (P = 0.01). However, there were no significant inter-group differences in insulin resistance, insulin, serum concentrations of lipocalin-2, BMI, BFP, and WHR after 6 weeks of Pilates training along with dill supplementation (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: We concluded that 6 weeks of Pilates training along with dill may be beneficial for improvements in serum concentrations of nesfatin-1 and FGP."

This experiment was carried out to assess the effects of unmodified biochar (30 g kg-1 soil) and biochar-based nanocomposites (BNCs) of iron (30 g BNC-FeO kg-1 soil), zinc (30 g BNC-ZnO kg-1 soil), and a combined form (15 g BNC-FeO + 15 g BNC-ZnO kg-1 soil) on dill (Anethum graveolens L.) plants under various salinity levels (non-saline, 6 and 12 dS m-1). The biochar-related treatments reduced sodium content of the plants, leading to a decline in osmolytes, antioxidant enzymes activities, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, NADP reduction, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid in dill leaf tissues. The combined form of BNCs reduced sodium content of leaf tissue by about 22% and 26% under 6 and 12 dS m-1 salinities, respectively. In contrast, addition of biochar, particularly biochar-based nanocomposites to the saline soil, enhanced potassium, iron, and zinc contents of leaf tissue, photosynthetic pigments, leaf water content, oxygen evolution rate, hill reaction and ATPase activities, endogenous indole-3-acetic acid, plant organs biomass, and consequently essential oil yield of plant organs. The combined form of BNCs in comparison with unmodified biochar improved vegetative, inflorescence, and seed biomass under 12 dS m-1 salinity by about 33%, 25%, and 6%, respectively. These findings revealed that BNCs with novel structure can potentially enhance salt tolerance, plant biomass, and essential oil yield of different organs in salt-stressed dill plants through decreasing leaf sodium content and ROS generation and increasing nutrient availability, water status, and photosynthetic pigments.",

      "abstract": "The performance of dill plant may be affected by adverse environments such as salinity. Thus, this research was designed to evaluate changes in chemical composition and antioxidant activity of seed essential oil of dill (Anethum graveolens L.) in response to salinity (0, 5, 10 and 15 dS/m) and 1 mM of each hormonal treatments (gibberellic acid, salicylic acid, and cytokinin). Salicylic acid (SA) reduced Na+ content of roots and leaves by 15.4%, 30.9% and 12.4%, 24.3%, but enhanced K+ content by 29.8%, 51.6% and 76.6%, 73.4% under moderate and severe salinities, respectively. Essential oil yield was enhanced with progressing seed filling, despite decreasing essential oil percentage. Percentage of essential oil was increased under low and moderate salinities. Hormonal treatments, particularly SA enhanced seed mass and essential oil percentage, leading to enhanced essential oil yield. The amounts of most constituents were enhanced under moderate salinity. Foliar spray of SA and CK (cytokinin) increased almost all essential oil components, except dill ether and dill apiole, while the GA3 (gibberellic acid) treatment reduced most of the constituents. The α-fenchol was only induced by salt stress. The β-pinene, 1-terpineol, cryptone, oxypeucedanin hydrate, α-thujene and P-α-dimethylstyrene were also specifically synthesized in SA treated plants under salinity. The highest TPC (total phenolic content) and antioxidant activity were recorded for essential oil of SA treated plants at mass maturity under moderate salinity. In general, the SA spray was the most effective treatment for improving essential oil quantity and quality of dill plants.",

This study aimed to assess the effects of 10 weeks of aerobic training (AT) and dill extract (DE) on miR-33 and miR-223 expression of liver in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats. Forty male Wistar rats were fed a defined high-fat (n = 32) and standard (n = 8, nonobese control [NC]) diet. After obesity induction, obese rats were randomly allocated to four groups: AT, DE, AT + DE, and obese control (OC). Rats were euthanized and plasma and liver tissue samples were collected after the intervention. The liver expression of miR-33 was lower in the AT, DE, AT + DE, and NC groups compared with the OC group. Also, the liver miR-223 expression was higher in the AT, DE, AT + DE, and NC groups compared with the OC group. Moreover, the liver expression of miR-223 in the AT + DE group was higher compared with the AT and DE groups. The AT, DE, AT + DE, and NC groups had lower liver TC compared with the OC group. Also, the plasma level of apolipoprotein B (Apo B) was significantly lower, and liver HDL-C was significantly higher in the AT + DE and NC groups compared with the OC group. These findings show that long-term AT combined with the intake of DE may improve the plasma levels of Apo B, and TC and HDL-C levels in the liver, which is probably due to AT and DE positive effects on miR-33 and miR-223 in the liver of obese rats. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Aerobic training reduces overweight and obesity health problems, however, the duration and intensity of the exercise training distinguish between individuals. We used an integrated approach combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological as a medical strategy to prevent HFD-induced metabolic injury in obese rats. The present results discovered that a combination of AT + DE intervention improves the miR-33 and miR-223 in the liver of obese rats.",

We wanted to do this systematic review on the effect of Anethum graveolens intake on lipid profile because the outcomes of multiple research and meta-analyses in this regard were inconsistent. A systematic search for English published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) covering PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Coherence library. The pooled weighted mean difference (MD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated and pooled using a random-effects model. Pooled data of 6 RCTs involving 171 intervention cases indicated that dill supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in mean serum total cholesterol (MD 95% CI= -3.71(-5.71,-1.70); P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (MD 95% CI= -1.51(-2.65,-0.47); P = 0.005), TG (triglycerides) (MD 95% CI= -2.48(-3.98,-0.98); P = 0.001) and interestingly high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (HDL-C) (MD 95% CI= -2.19(-3.58,-0.81); P = 0.002). Subgroup analysis showed that dill use was more effective in lowering triglyceride in both hyperlipidemic patients, MD 95% CI= -3.54(-6.49,-0.60); P = 0.02) and type 2 diabetes (MD 95% CI= -3.64(-5.69,-1.58); P = 0.001).

This study explored the protective effects of AGS extract on mucosal damages and inflammation in reflux esophagitis rats. AGS inhibited cellular inflammation including NO production and the expression of inflammatory proteins (iNOS and COX2 etc.), cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and nuclear transfer factor related to NF-κB signaling caused by LPS stimulation in vitro. Furthermore, reflux esophagitis-induced rats were used to observe the anti-inflammatory effect of AGS. Tissue staining and inflammation-related protein expression of rats with acute reflux esophagitis indicated that AGS improved this inflammatory response, such as COX-2 and TNF-α in mucosa. In conclusion, AGS have good physiological activity and the possibility of being used as a medicinal food and a functional resource for the prevention and therapy of gastroesophageal diseases."

Effects of cholesterol-lowering dill tablets and aqueous extract of Ocimum basilicum L. (basil) on learning and memory and hippocampus fatty acid composition were examined. mRNA levels of the genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis were also determined in high-cholesterol diet (HCD) fed rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were allocated to 4 groups: rats fed chow diet (C); rats fed high-cholesterol (2%) diet (HCD); rats treated with HCD+300 mg/kg dill tablets (HCD+Dill); and finally, rats fed HCD and treated with 400 mg/kg basil aqueous extract (HCD+basil). Treatment was carried out for 16 weeks. Hippocampus Aβ(1-42) level was determined. Spatial and passive avoidance tests were used to examine cognitive functions. Hippocampal FA composition was assessed by gas chromatography. Basil aqueous extract was analyzed by GC-double mass spectroscopy (GC-MS/MS) and expression of LXR-α, LXR-β, and ABCA1 genes was assessed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Dill tablets and basil extract remarkably ameliorated serum cholesterol (P<0.001), retarded hippocampal accumulation of Aβ, and attenuated HCD-induced memory impairment. Hippocampus FA composition did not change but serum cholesterol was found positively correlated with hippocampus Aβ(1-42) (P<0.001), total n 6 PUFA (P=0.013), and Aβ(1-42) showed correlation with the ratio of n6 to n3 PUFA. At least 70 components were identified in basil aqueous extract. CONCLUSION: Dill tablets and aqueous extract of basil attenuated the hypercholesterolemia-induced memory impairment by lowering serum cholesterol and hippocampus amyloid deposits, and probably beneficial in AD adjuvant therapy."

This study investigated beneficial therapeutic effects of Dill tablet and Ocimum basilicum (Basil) aqueous extract on hypercholesterolemia-induced cognitive deficits and oxidative stress in hippocampus tissues of rats. Hippocampal Aβ(1-42) level was measured. The gene expression levels of superoxide dismutase and inducible-nitric oxide synthase were determined in hippocampus. Cognitive functions were examined and oxidative status was evaluated in serum and hippocampus. Phytochemical properties and in vitro antioxidant activity of Basil extract were assessed. HCD significantly increased serum cholesterol, induced deposition of Aβ plaque, altered hippocampus morphology, and impaired memory function, whereas receiving Basil extract or Dill tablet increased antioxidant potency in serum and hippocampus and normalized HCD-induced deleterious effects. Basil extract and Dill tablet may exhibit their beneficial effects in AD by lowering serum cholesterol and evoking antioxidant system in the brain. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Dill tablet and Basil aqueous extract lowered serum cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic animal models, therefore, they can be used as hypocholesterolemic agents. These edible herbs significantly retarded deposition of Aβ plaque and normalized hippocampal morphology, thus, they favorably protected hippocampus tissue from deleterious effects-induced by hypercholesterolemia. Dill tablet and Basil aqueous extract also corrected oxide-redox balance and normalized HCD-induced oxidative stress to some extent and significantly improved impairments in learning and memory suggesting that these medicinal plants can be considered as surrogate therapeutic agents for the synthetic medicines in the treatment of AD and in postponement of its complications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The loss of structural elastin due to intrinsic and extrinsic ageing results in the skin's inability to stretch and recoil (decrease in elasticity) and manifests as loss of skin firmness and sagging. While other extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as collagen and hyaluronic acid are continually synthesized and assembled through life, elastic fibres are not. Elastic fibre assembly and functionality require fibre cross-linking, induced by the lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL) enzymes, which sharply decrease during ageing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the enhanced elastogenic effect of a blackberry-dill extract combination, which was hypothesized to induce elastin fibre component synthesis, fibre cross-linking and reduce elastin fibre degradation. METHODS: The blackberry and the dill extracts were tested separately and in combination to confirm single ingredient bioactivity and synergistic benefits. Human skin explants, dermal fibroblasts, elastase assays, ELISAs, quantitative real-time PCRs and spectrofluorometer measurements were used. Moreover, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study was carried out to assess skin elasticity using Cutometer and histologically from biopsies. RESULTS: The blackberry extract induced elastin gene expression, elastin promoter activity and inhibited elastic fibre degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 9 and 12. The dill extract induced elastin, collagen and LOXL1 gene expression, resulting in enhanced fibre cross-linking in human skin explants. Clinically, the blackberry and dill combination treatment displayed synergistic pro-elasticity activity as compared to each ingredient alone and placebo. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrated the two multimodal plant-based extracts complemented each other in terms of bioactivity and resulted in a synergistic elastogenesis induction.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Anethum graveolens (dill) powder supplementation on glycemic control, lipid profile, some antioxidants and inflammatory markers, and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 42 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups and received either 3 g/day dill powder or placebo (3 capsules/day, 1 g each). Fasting blood sugar, insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde and gastrointestinal symptoms were measured in all of the subjects at baseline and postintervention. RESULTS: The dill powder supplementation significantly decreased the mean serum levels of insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and malondialdehyde in the intervention group in comparison with the baseline measurements (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mean serum levels of high-density lipoprotein and total antioxidant capacity were significantly increased in the intervention group in comparison with the baseline measurement (P < 0.05). Colonic motility disorder was the only gastrointestinal symptom whose frequency was significantly reduced by supplementation (P = 0.01). The mean changes in insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and malondialdehyde were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, the mean changes in high-density lipoprotein were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dill powder supplementation can be effective in controlling the glycemic, lipid, stress oxidative and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      "abstract": "Elastic fibers (90% elastin, 10% fibrillin-rich microfibrils) are synthesized only in early life and adolescence mainly by the vascular smooth muscle cells through the cross-linking of its soluble precursor, tropoelastin. Elastic fibers endow the large elastic arteries with resilience and elasticity. Normal vascular aging is associated with arterial remodeling and stiffening, especially due to the end of production and degradation of elastic fibers, leading to altered cardiovascular function. Several pharmacological treatments stimulate the production of elastin and elastic fibers. In particular, dill extract (DE) has been demonstrated to stimulate elastin production in vitro in dermal equivalent models and in skin fibroblasts to increase lysyl oxidase-like-1 (LOXL-1) gene expression, an enzyme contributing to tropoelastin crosslinking and elastin formation. Here, we have investigated the effects of a chronic treatment (three months) of aged male mice with DE (5% or 10% v/v, in drinking water) on the structure and function of the ascending aorta. DE treatment, especially at 10%, of aged mice protected pre-existing elastic lamellae, reactivated tropoelastin and LOXL-1 expressions, induced elastic fiber neo-synthesis, and decreased the stiffness of the aging aortic wall, probably explaining the reversal of the age-related cardiac hypertrophy also observed following the treatment. DE could thus be considered as an anti-aging product for the cardiovascular system.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of boiled dill seed (Anethum graveolens) on anxiety during childbirth compared with oxytocin. METHODS: This study was a randomized clinical trial with 100 pregnant women who were assigned to the oxytocin (50 cases) and the boiled dill seed (50 cases) group by a table of random number. In the boiled dill seed group, 10 g of dill seed was boiled in 100 mL for 10 min and was given to women after filtration once orally at the beginning of active phase. In the oxytocin group, 10 IU of oxytocin in 1000 mL of Ringer solution was prescribed according to the clinical routine. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) in both groups before (at the beginning of the active phase) and after (6 h after the delivery) was completed. Meanwhile, pain intensity and duration of labor, dilatation and effacement scores, Apgar score of newborns, and FHR were measured and evaluated. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were shown in obvious anxiety scores between the two groups at baseline (P0.05). After the delivery, in the boiled dill seed group, the number of women with severe [0 vs. 8.0% (4/50)] and almost severe [0 vs. 14.0% (7/50)] trait and almost severe [0 vs. 14.0% (7/50)] state anxiety was lower than those in the control group (P=0.050, P=0.041, respectively). Moreover, labor was shorter in the 1st (P 0.01), 2nd (P=0.78) and 3rd (P=0.10) stages in the boiled dill seed group compared to the control group CONCLUSIONS: Dill seed could be used as an effective treatment to reduce anxiety during labor. Dill seed can be effective in reducing the length of labor. Due to lack of maternal and fetal complications, the boiled dill seed could also be used to reduce cesarean section rates in women who are fearful and anxious of delivery.

Total 192 broiler chicks were grouped randomly into six treatments and fed with basal diet (BD) along with different levels of seeds, viz., T1 (BD), T2 (BD + 0.2% HS), T3 (BD + 0.2% HS + 0.3 DS), T4 (BD + 0.3% HS) and T5 (BD + 0.3% HS + 0.3 DS) and T6 (BD + 0.025% Bacitracin Methylene Disalicylate-BMD). The performance traits like feed intake, body weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) and carcass traits like cut-up parts, giblet and abdominal fat yield remained unaffected due to dietary treatments for overall trial period; however, the average feed intake in early phase (0-3 weeks) reduced significantly (p < 0.05) in treatment birds than both controls (T1 & T6). Serum protein concentration remained unchanged, whereas significant (p < 0.05) reduction in serum lipids like triglyceride, LDL and total cholesterol concentration was noticed due to dietary inclusion of seeds. Serum enzymes like AST and ALT concentrations depleted significantly (p < 0.05) treated groups, except at higher seed doses (T5); however, alkaline phosphatase levels were unaffected. Coliform count in caecum and jejunum reduced linearly (p < 0.01) due to seed inclusion, whereas dose-dependent proliferation of lactobacilli was evident (p < 0.01) in caecum and jejunum of treated birds. No effect was observed on the villus height and crypt depth of the jejunal mucosa. To conclude, dietary supplementation of hemp and dill seed could not affect the growth performance and carcass traits; however, it positively altered the serum lipid profile of the birds and improved gut health as well, thereby enhanced overall performance of broiler chickens.",

This study was a single centre, single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, in which 60 women with microbiology-confirmed vulvovaginal candidiasis were randomly assigned to dill and clotrimazole groups. At the end of the study, the estimated prevalence of leucorrhoea, burning, and itching was 23%, 23% and 20% in dill users, respectively. This figure was 20%, 10% and 16.7% for the clotrimazole group, respectively. The difference between the two groups was not significant. 13% of suppository patients, compared with 10% of clotrimazole-treatment patients, had a positive culture, which was not significant (p = .68). According to findings, 2% dill vaginal suppositories were as effective as clotrimazole vaginal tablets in reducing both clinical and microbiological symptoms of Candidiasis. Studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm current findings. Impact statement What is already known on the subject? Based on results from in vivo and in vitro animal studies, dill (Anethum graveolens) has anti-candida activity. What do the results of this study add? It appears that 2% dill vaginal suppositories were as effective as 100 mg clotrimazole vaginal tablets in reducing both the clinical and microbiological symptoms. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and further research? Obstetricians and gynaecologists can offer dill as a useful alternative to chemical drugs, especially in women who are often interested in herbal medicine, or in women who are resistant or are not allowed to use antifungal drugs.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The medicinal herb, Anethum graveolens L. (dill) is one of the potent culinary herbs used as an alternative form of medicine worldwide. The unguent topical Oil from the aerial parts of A. graveolens was found to be effective in the management of uterus cancer in ethnomedicine has been reported. BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality rates of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are steadily rising worldwide, especially, in underdeveloped and developing countries. Moreover, HCC develops rapidly in patients with chronic cirrhosis or hepatitis, where the solid tumours/malignancies coexist with the inflammation. Recent studies have shown that the medicinal herb, Anethum graveolens, holds anticancer potential, which could be a promising approach for the treatment of various tumours. AIM: In the current study, we have analysed the antiproliferative effect of ethyl acetate fraction of Dill Seeds (EAFD) on HepG2 cell line. METHODS: Cell viability and proliferation were observed by MTT assay; Morphological changes were studied using fluorescent stains like Hoechst 33342, acridine orange/ethidium bromide and JC-1 dye. Further, the pro-apoptotic activity was demonstrated through Annexin-V-FITC/ PI assay and cell cycle analysis. Different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mg/ml) of EAFD were studied. RESULTS: EAFD markedly suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. The phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy revealed the morphological alterations like disruption, shrinkage, detachment and blebbing of cell membrane accompanied by nuclear condensation after exposure to EAFD. Radical scavenging activity was evidenced by measurement of ROS levels post-treatment. Modulation of mitochondrial membrane potential was exhibited leading to the activation of caspases 3/7 and 9 which is a committed step towards apoptosis. Annexin V-FITC/ PI assay and cell cycle, later confirmed the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in 'G2/M' phase through flow cytometric analysis. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a significant apoptogenic effect was exhibited by EAFD against HepG2 cells in inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Our findings indicate that the medicinal herb- Anethum graveolens, holds potential in treating hepatocellular carcinoma effectively.",

Chemical compositions of EOs were also tested by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that cardamom and dill weed EOs possess greater antimicrobial activity than cumin with larger inhibition zones and lower minimum inhibitory concentrations. The permeability of cell membrane and cell membrane integrity were evaluated by determining relative electric conductivity and release of cell constituents into supernatant at 260 nm, respectively. Moreover, effect of EOs on the cell membrane of Campylobacter spp. was also investigated by measuring extracellular ATP concentration. Increase of relative electric conductivity, extracellular ATP concentration, and cell constituents' release after treatment with EOs demonstrated that tested EOs affected the membrane integrity of Campylobacter spp. The results supported high efficiency of cardamom, cumin, and dill weed EOs to inhibit Campylobacter spp. by impairing the bacterial cell membrane.",

Polyphenol compounds were identified by LC-MS-QTof and quantified by UPLC-PDA-FL. Thirty phenolic compounds were identified in these three herbs. The major compounds were (i) coriander: dimethoxycinnamoyl hexoside and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, (ii) dill: neochlorogenic acid and quercetin glucuronide, and (iii) parsley: apigenin-7-apiosylglucoside (apiin) and isorhamnetin-3-O-hexoside. The application of these three organic acids favored the accumulation of phenolic compounds in coriander plants, but had no significant positive effects on dill and parsley.

Carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxic rats were used to show the hepatoprotective activity of dill leaves. Different concentration of dill extract (0.032, 0.065, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL) showed potential antioxidant ability. The extract of dill leaves significantly reduced AGEs formation and also fructosamine and protein carbonyl levels in rats' liver. Thiol groups' oxidation, amyloid cross-β, and protein fragmentation (P < 0.001) significantly reduced in treated rats. Liver damage markers significantly reduced in dill-treated animals (P < 0.05). Dill with potential antioxidant, antiglycation, and hepatoprotective effects can be suggested for treatment of diabetes complications."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mouthrinses have been in use for centuries as breath fresheners, medicaments, and antiseptics. Dill is said to be a good source of calcium, manganese and iron. It contains flavonoids known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. Dill can help with microbial infections in the mouth; and its anti-oxidants minimize damage caused by free radicals to the gums and teeth. Being a good source of calcium, dill also helps with bone and dental health. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of commercially available 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthrinse and dill seed oil mouthrinse on plaque levels and gingivitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized controlled, double blind parallel arm study was conducted over 90 days on 90 subjects. The subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups and baseline data was collected using Loe and Silness gingival index and Quigley Hein plaque index and oral prophylaxis was performed on all the subjects. The mouthrinses included in the present study were dill seed oil and Hexodent (0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate). Intervention regarding the mouthrinsing was given to the subjects and were followed up for 45 days and 90 days, after this post intervention changes were assessed using the respective indices. RESULTS: It was observed that there is no significant difference in gingival & plaque scores among two mouthrinses from baseline to 45 days and 90 days. It was observed that there is statistical difference in gingival and plaque scores when compared with baseline to 45 days (p<0.001), baseline to 90 days (p<0.001) and 45 days to 90 days (p<0.001) when intergroup comparisons were done. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that dill seed oil and Hexodent (0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate) mouthrinse have similar antiplaque and antigingival effectiveness."

A commercial medicine prepared from Anethum graveolens L (dill) is being used as dill tablet (DT) as a hypolipidemic agent. This experiment aimed to investigate the protective effect of DT against hepatic damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6) as following for a 10 days experiments. (1) Normal animals; (2) normal animals +CCl4 1 ml/kg (1:1 of CCl4 in olive oil, by gastric tube); (3) CCl4 treated animals +100 mg DT/kg; (4) CCl4 treated animals +300 mg DT/kg. After 10 days of treatment, biochemical factors were measured; also antioxidant tests such as thiol group, malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and catalase (CAT) activity in the liver samples were carried out. RESULTS: In dill treated animals, a significant decrease in liver enzymes lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, γ-glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, as well as triglyceride, total cholesterol (P < 0.05) were observed. Total protein and albumin concentrations were significantly increased in dill treated groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, treatment with dill declined liver cholesterol, triglyceride, MDA, and increased TAC and CAT activity compared with untreated group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dill displayed a potential hepatoprotective effect against CCl4-induced liver damage based on both biochemical markers and antioxidant status."

      "abstract": "Pumping water from coal seams decreases the pressure in the seam and in turn releases trapped methane; this is the most common and economic method of methane extraction. The water that is pumped out is known as \"coal-bed methane water\" (CBMW), which is high in sodium and other salts. In the past 25 yr, the United States has seen a 16-fold increase in the production of coal bed methane gas, and trillions of cubic meters are yet to be extracted. There is no sustainable disposal method for CBMW, and there are very few studies investigating the effects of this water on plants and their secondary metabolites and on soil properties. This study was conducted to determine the effects of CBMW on soil chemical properties and on the biomass and essential oil yield and composition of dill ( L.). This crop was grown in a greenhouse and was subjected to different levels of CBMW treatment: tap water only; 25% CBMW, 75% tap water; 50% CBMW, 50% tap water; 75% CBMW, 25% tap water; and 100% CBMW. The major dill oil constituents, limonene and α-phellandrene, were not affected by the treatments; however, the concentration of dill ether increased with increasing CBMW levels, whereas the concentration of carvone decreased. In soil, sodium level significantly increased with increasing level of treatment, but pH and cation exchange capacity were not much affected. Coal bed methane water could be used for irrigation of dill for one growing season, but longer-term studies may be needed to clarify the long-term effects on soil and plant.",

The effect was investigated of inoculation with AMF on the synthesis of a wide range of EO in two aromatic species, coriander (Coriandrum sativum) and dill (Anethum graveolens), in a garden experiment under outdoor conditions. Plants were grown in 4-l pots filled with soil, which was either γ-irradiated (eliminating native AMF) or left non-sterile (containing native AMF), and inoculated or not with an isolate of Rhizophagus irregularis. AMF inoculation significantly stimulated EO synthesis in both plant species. EO synthesis (total EO and several individual constituents) was increased in dill in all mycorrhizal treatments (containing native and/or inoculated AMF) compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. In contrast, EO concentrations in coriander (total EO and most constituents) were increased only in the treatment combining both inoculated and native AMF. A clear positive effect of AMF on EO synthesis was found for both aromatic plants, which was, however, specific for each plant species and modified by the pool of AMF present in the soil.",

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Dill compared to mefenamic acid on primary dysmenorrhea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, clinical trial study was conducted on 75 single female students between 18 and 28 years old educating in Nursing and Midwifery School and Paramedical Faculty of Qom University of Medical Sciences of Iran in 2011. They were allocated randomly into one of the three groups: In Dill group, they took 1000 mg of Dill powder q12h for 5 days from 2 days before the beginning of menstruation for two cycles. Other groups received 250 mg mefenamic acid or 500 mg starch capsule as placebo, respectively. Dysmenorrhea severity was determined by a verbal multidimensional scoring system and a visual analog scale (VAS). Students with mild dysmenorrhea were excluded. Data were analyzed by SPSS using the descriptive statistic, paired-samples t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between three groups for demographic or descriptive variables. Comprising the VAS showed that the participants of Dill and mefenamic acid groups had lower significant pain in the 1(st) and the 2(nd) months after treatment, whereas in the placebo group this was only significant in the 2(nd) month (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dill was as effective as mefenamic acid in reducing the pain severity in primary dysmenorrhea. Further studies regarding side-effects of Dill and its interactivity are recommended."

The present study investigated the effects of plant extracts on cellular markers of endothelial function (eNOS activation and expression and ET-1 secretion). RESULTS: Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with persimmon extract significantly increased Akt and eNOS phosphorylation and nitric oxide metabolites and significantly decreased secretion of ET-1 to the media after 24 h compared with a vehicle control (all P < 0.01). None of the other plant extracts significantly altered any markers of endothelial function.

This clinical trial study designed to investigate whether herbal medicine, Anethum graveolens (dill) extract, could improve metabolic components in patients with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial using a parallel design was conducted. 24 subjects who had metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria (update of ATP III) were randomly assigned to either dill extract (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12) for 3 months. RESULTS: Across lipid component of metabolic syndrome, no significant differences in triglyceride (TG) concentration and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were seen between the two groups. However TG improved significantly from baseline (257.0 vs. 201.5p = 0.01) with dill treatment but such a significant effect was not observed in placebo group. Moreover, no significant differences in waist circumference, blood pressure and fasting blood sugar were seen between two groups after 3 months follow up period. CONCLUSION: In this small clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome, 12 weeks of dill extract treatment had a beneficial effect in terms of reducing TG from baseline. However dill treatment was not associated with a significant improvement in metabolic syndrome related markers compared to control group. Larger studies might be required to prove the efficacy and safety of long-term administration of dill to resolve metabolic syndrome components."

The compost contained about 2000 mg kg(-)(1) of Cu. Dill yields were greatest in the 20 or 40% treatments, but peppermint yields were greatest in the 20% treatment. Compost additions increased soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC), HNO(3) extractable soil B, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P, S, Na, and Pb. Additions of high-Cu compost to soil increased tissue P, S, and Na in both crops and Mn, Mo, and Zn in dill but decreased tissue Ca, Cd, and Fe in both crops and Mn, Mo, and Zn in peppermint, increased Cu in all soil fractions including exchangeable, and increased tissue Cu of dill and peppermint as compared to unamended soil. Addition of 60% of high-Cu compost to soil resulted in 760-780 mg kg(-)(1) Cu in the growth medium. Nevertheless, Cu content in both crops reached only 12 mg kg(-)(1) DW in the 60% compost treatment, which is below the toxicity levels for plants and below the upper chronic dietary exposure for animals. The application of high-Cu compost altered chemical composition of dill and peppermint essential oils, but oils were free of Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni, Cr, and Pb. Results from this study suggest that mature composts with concentrations of Cu and Zn of 2008 and 321 mg/kg, respectively, can be used as a soil conditioner without risk for phytotoxicity or risk of increasing the normal range of Cu and Zn in crop tissue. However, the long-term effect of the accumulation of heavy metals in soils following repeated compost applications needs to be carefully considered.",
