      "abstract": "Evidence for involvement of astrocytes in several neurodegenerative disorders and in drug addiction has been emerging over the last two decades, but only in recent years have astrocytes been investigated for their roles in alcohol use disorder (AUD). As a result, there is a need to evaluate existing preclinical literature supporting involvement of astrocytes in the effects of alcohol exposure. Here we review emerging evidence about responses of astrocytes to alcohol, and the contributions of astrocytes to the development of AUD. We review studies of single-cell RNA sequencing with a focus on alcohol and astrocyte heterogeneity, astrocyte reactivity, and the role of astrocytes in remodeling the extracellular matrix. Effects of alcohol on astrocyte-modulated synaptic transmission are also discussed emphasizing studies never reviewed before. Since astrocytes play essential roles in brain development, we review recent research on the role of astrocytes in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) which may also shed light on fetal development of psychiatric disorders that have a high prevalence in individuals affected by FASD. Finally, this review highlights gaps in knowledge about astrocyte biology and alcohol that need further research. Particularly, the dire need to identify astrocyte subpopulations and molecules that are susceptible to alcohol exposure and may be targets for therapeutic intervention."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Alcohol use is one of the leading causes of death and disability globally; however, access to evidence-based care for alcohol use disorder (AUD) is limited. Although telemedicine-based interventions promise to expand treatment access, there are no validated telemedicine-based interventions for alcohol withdrawal management. In this single-arm study, we sought to determine the feasibility of delivering symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal management over telemedicine. METHODS: Thirty actively drinking participants with AUD and a history of alcohol withdrawal were recruited to participate. Participants were scheduled for 3 days of symptom-triggered withdrawal management using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale Revised delivered by a trained clinician over a telemedicine platform. Primary outcomes were retention in treatment and need for transfer to a higher level of care (eg, the emergency room). Satisfaction with the treatment protocol and relapse to any alcohol use 30 days following treatment initiation were also assessed. RESULTS: In total, 93.3% of participants completed all 3 days of alcohol withdrawal management. No participants required transfer to a higher level of care. Satisfaction with treatment was high, with an average Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 score of 30.9 (SD = 1.5) out of 32. After the follow-up period, 56.7% of participants remained abstinent from alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides preliminary evidence that symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal management over telemedicine is feasible and satisfactory for patients. If these findings are replicated, they could have important implications for access to alcohol withdrawal management services, especially in remote, rural, and underserved regions that lack specialized withdrawal management facilities."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychological parameters related to alcohol dependence (AD) affect patients' behavioral and cognitive control, decision making, impulsivity and inhibitory control. People with AD often have a chronic course with a relapse to dependent substance use even after extensive treatment. This study investigated whether the psychological parameters of patients with AD predict (a) premature termination of treatment, and/or (b) relapse into consumption of alcohol from admission until 6 weeks after discharge from an inpatient rehabilitation treatment. METHODS: Participants: Alcohol-dependent patients consecutively admitted for a duration of about three months to inpatient rehabilitation treatment in a hospital specialized in substance use disorders. Craving (OCDS-G) and impulsivity (BIS-11; UPPS) were assessed with computerized questionnaires. Attentional bias and inhibitory control were measured with two computer-based experiments (dot-probe task; stop-signal task (SST)). Investigations were conducted at entry (T1); after 6 weeks (T2); and during the last two weeks of the inpatient treatment (T3). Some N = 128 patients finished the first, N = 102 the second and N = 83 the third assessments. Outcome variables were discontinuation of treatment and abstinence or relapse until follow-up 6 weeks after discharge; participants were contacted via telephone. RESULTS: None of the variables are associated with discontinuation of treatment. Poor inhibitory control (SST) and high craving (OCDS-5) levels, measured at T1, are significantly associated with relapse. Higher impulsivity (UPPS) measured at T2 and T3 is significantly associated with relapse. Exploratory analyses showed that older age, longer inpatient treatment duration and time spent in abstinence before rehabilitation treatment were significantly associated with a reduced risk of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological parameters, craving and impulsivity levels did not predict relapse to a high degree. It is assumed that discontinuation of treatment and relapse may be associated with different issues, such as social context, and individual motivation levels. In contrast, the length of both abstinence before admission and of inpatient treatment were significantly associated with abstinence; it is here suggested that recovery time duration may be an underestimated influencing factor regarding relapse in AD patients."

      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), such as semaglutide, are widely used in the treatment of metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. These medications primarily function by enhancing insulin secretion; however, emerging evidence suggests that the effects extend beyond metabolic regulation. In this issue of the JCI, Farokhnia et al. evaluated the effects of GLP-1RAs alongside another T2D treatment, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4Is), on alcohol consumption in humans and preclinical models. In humans, GLP1-RAs, but not DPP-4Is, were associated with reductions in alcohol consumption. Similarly, DPP-4 inhibition had no effect on alcohol intake in rodents. These findings invite further exploration of the mechanisms by which GLP-1RAs reduce alcohol consumption and redefine our pharmacotherapy approach to alcohol use disorder (AUD) by opening the possibility for application as an early harm-reduction tool.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle is a major target for ethanol-induced perturbations, leading to sarcopenia in alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). The complex interactions and pathways involved in adaptive and maladaptive responses to ethanol in skeletal muscle are not well understood. Unlike hypothesis-driven experiments, an integrated multiomics-experimental validation approach provides a comprehensive view of these interactions. METHODS: We performed multiomics analyses with experimental validation to identify novel regulatory mechanisms of sarcopenia in ALD. Studies were done in a comprehensive array of models including ethanol-treated (ET) murine and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myotubes (hiPSCm), skeletal muscle from a mouse model of ALD (mALD) and human patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis and controls. We generated 13 untargeted datasets, including chromatin accessibility (assay for transposase accessible chromatin), RNA sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylomics and metabolomics, and conducted integrated multiomics analyses using UpSet plots and feature extraction. Key findings were validated using immunoblots, redox measurements (NAD+/NADH ratio), imaging and senescence-associated molecular phenotype (SAMP) assays. Mechanistic studies included mitochondrial-targeted Lactobacillus brevis NADH oxidase (MitoLbNOX) to increase redox ratio and MitoTempo as a mitochondrial free radical scavenger. RESULTS: Multiomics analyses revealed enrichment in mitochondrial oxidative function, protein synthesis and senescence pathways consistent with the known effects of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) during normoxia. Across preclinical and clinical models, HIF1α targets (n = 32 genes) and signalling genes (n > 100 genes) (n = 3 ATACseq, n = 65 phosphoproteomics, n = 10 acetylomics, n = 6 C2C12 proteomics, n = 106 C2C12 RNAseq, n = 64 hiPSC RNAseq, n = 30 hiPSC proteomics, n = 3 mouse proteomics, n = 25 mouse RNAseq, n = 8 human RNAseq, n = 3 human proteomics) were increased. Stabilization of HIF1α (C2C12, 6hEtOH 0.24 ± 0.09; p = 0.043; mALD 0.32 ± 0.074; p = 0.005; data shown as mean difference ± standard error mean) was accompanied by enrichment in the early transient and late change clusters, -log(p-value) = 1.5-3.8, of the HIF1α signalling pathway. Redox ratio was reduced in ET myotubes (C2C12: 15512 ± 872.1, p < 0.001) and mALD muscle, with decreased expression of electron transport chain components (CI-V, p < 0.05) and Sirt3 (C2C12: 0.067 ± 0.023, p = 0.025; mALD: 0.41 ± 0.12, p = 0.013). Acetylation of mitochondrial proteins was increased in both models (C2C12: 107364 ± 4558, p = 0.03; mALD: 40036 ± 18 987, p = 0.049). Ethanol-induced SAMP was observed across models (P16: C2C12: 0.2845 ± 0.1145, p < 0.05; hiPSCm: 0.2591, p = 0.041). MitoLbNOX treatment reversed redox imbalance, HIF1α stabilization, global acetylation and myostatin expression (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: An integrated multiomics approach, combined with experimental validation, identifies HIF1α stabilization and accelerated post-mitotic senescence as novel mechanisms of sarcopenia in ALD. These findings show the complex molecular interactions leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and progressive sarcopenia in ALD.",

      "abstract": "Approximately 50% of people living with HIV (PWH) in the United States misuse alcohol, and they are at increased risk of chronic lung inflammation despite antiretroviral therapy. Acetaldehyde, a metabolite of alcohol, circulates systemically and directly impacts alveolar macrophages (AMs), the primary reservoir of HIV in the lungs. Acetaldehyde promotes AM HIV replication and triggers interleukin (IL)-1β release. We explored the mechanisms by which alcohol-derived acetaldehyde drives HIV replication and IL-1β release in AMs. Further, we tested if the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ agonist, pioglitazone, attenuates AM HIV replication and IL-1β release. Primary mouse AMs (mAMs), MH-S cells (an AM cell line), and THP-1 (human monocyte cell line)-derived macrophages were treated with alcohol-derived acetaldehyde (acetaldehyde generating system, AGS), HIV 1ADA, and EcoHIV, a chimeric HIV that infects murine cells. HIV expression was confirmed by HIV gag RNA (qRT-PCR) and p24 release (ELISA). IL-1β was measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release was quantified by Amplex Red assay. Further, immunoblot analysis of ERK1/2, PPARγ, and nuclear factor (NF)-ĸB/p65 (p65) was used to identify how acetaldehyde potentiates HIV replication and IL-1β activation in AMs. AGS increased H2O2, leading to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which deactivated PPARγ. AGS drove nuclear p65 translocation in HIV-infected cells, which enhanced HIV replication and IL-1β release. Treatment with pioglitazone decreased nuclear p65, attenuating AGS-induced HIV replication and IL-1β activation in AMs. We identified mechanisms underlying acetaldehyde-induced inflammatory activation and potentiation of HIV replication in AMs, which could be therapeutically targeted with pioglitazone to decrease HIV-related respiratory comorbidities among PWH who misuse alcohol."

Ibudilast is a neuroimmune modulator which selectively inhibits phosphodiesterases (PDE) 3, PDE4, PDE10, and PDE11, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of ibudilast for AUD compared with placebo. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was a double-masked, phase 2 trial conducted at an academic research center between October 2018 and April 2023. Eligible participants were adults seeking treatment for moderate or severe AUD. After completing the 12-week treatment period, participants were followed up for an additional 4 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Ibudilast taken twice daily in 50 mg doses for 12 weeks vs placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of heavy drinking days; secondary efficacy outcomes included drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, and percentage of days abstinent. Registered exploratory analyses tested whether the effects of ibudilast of drinking outcomes were moderated by baseline depressive symptomatology. Registered exploratory analyses also tested whether ibudilast reduced inflammation compared with placebo, as indicated by circulating levels of proinflammatory markers over the 12-week trial. Additionally, a post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether sex moderated the effect of ibudilast on drinking outcomes. Data were analyzed between October 2018 and April 2023. RESULTS: A total of 102 participants were enrolled in the study (mean [SD] age, 44.3 [10.8] years; 61 male [59.8%]; 24 Black [23.5%], 32 Hispanic [31.4%], 52 White [51.0%]). Baseline demographic characteristics and alcohol use patterns did not significantly differ between the 2 medication conditions. There was no significant difference between ibudilast vs placebo on percentage of heavy drinking days (β = 0.06, SE = 0.08 [95% CI, -0.09 to 0.21]; P = .46). There were no significant differences between ibudilast vs placebo on registered secondary outcomes. There were no significant effects of ibudilast compared with placebo on peripheral markers of inflammation. Moderation analyses found that baseline depressive symptomology (time 2 for drinks per drinking day: β = 0.25, SE = 0.11 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.48]; P = .03) and sex (β = -2.48, SE = 1.07 [95% CI, -4.59 to -0.37]; P = .02) may moderate the effects of ibudilast. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of ibudilast for the treatment of AUD, there was no support for the efficacy of ibudilast over placebo; additionally, no effect of ibudilast on markers of peripheral inflammation was observed. As novel treatments for AUD are developed for novel molecular targets, their effects may depend on mechanisms and moderators of efficacy.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol-associated steatohepatitis (ASH), a severe form of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), is characterized by pronounced steatosis and immune cells infiltration. As an inflammatory disease, ASH still lacks effective immunotherapies, and the mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced immune imbalance in the liver microenvironment remain elusive. RNA modifications are known to maintain hepatic homeostasis during physiological and pathological processes. This study aimed to investigate the alteration of RNA modification in ASH and its specific roles in regulating immune homeostasis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this study, we found that the levels of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification and its key writer, METTL3, are markedly reduced in mice livers during ASH. Notably, hepatocyte-specific Mettl3 knockout exacerbated ASH by enhancing steatosis and neutrophil infiltration, whereas hepatocyte-specific Mettl3 overexpression alleviated these effects. Mechanistically, ethanol promotes METTL3 degradation via E3-ubiquitin-ligase STUB1-mediated ubiquitination and disrupts the protective interaction between HSP70 and METTL3, impairing hepatic m6A modification. Furthermore, the expression of ATF3 was upregulated via m6A-dependent mechanism. Importantly, hepatocyte-specific Atf3 overexpression abolished METTL3-mediated amelioration of ASH, whereas hepatocyte-specific Atf3 knockdown attenuated Metl3 knockout-induced exacerbation of ASH in vivo. Consistently, high hepatic ATF3 expression is associated with an inflammatory liver microenvironment in ALD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results demonstrate that alcohol consumption disrupts the homeostasis of hepatic immune microenvironment in ASH through impairment of METTL3-dependent m6A RNA modification. Targeting METTL3 to preserve its enzymatic activity and stability could represent a novel therapeutic avenue for ASH intervention."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five eligible studies on 93,899 (33,834 AUD intervention) patients with ALD were analyzed. Data presented as HR, with a 95% CI. Of 14 studies in patients with ALD outside the liver transplantation (LT) setting, pooled data from 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed that AUD treatment reduces alcohol relapse by 73% (HR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.15-0.46) with any treatment and by 77% (HR: 0.23, 95% CI:0.14-0.39) with medications in 5 RCTs on 322 (186 intervention) patients. AUD treatment from observational studies was associated with reduced readmission (5 studies) by 48% and decompensation (2 studies) by 52%, but not patient mortality (3 studies). Data showed moderate to high heterogeneity, without publication bias. Analysis of 8 observational studies on LT recipients showed that AUD treatment reduced alcohol relapse in the post-LT period by 59%, with 58% and 60% reduction using integrated and nonintegrated models, respectively. AUD treatment among LT recipients was associated with a reduction in patient mortality by 56% in 3 observational studies, but not in 2 RCTs (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.38-1.79). Pooled data were homogeneous in the analysis of alcohol relapse but showed moderate heterogeneity in analyzing patient mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Available data on AUD treatment in patients with ALD improves abstinence and liver-related outcomes both outside and within LT settings. RCTs are needed to examine (a) medications in patients with ALD to examine the benefit of alcohol relapse and patient outcomes and (b) the benefit of integrated multidisciplinary treatment to manage the dual pathology (AUD and liver disease).",

      "abstract": "Despite research suggesting that sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) experience high rates of risky alcohol use (RAU) and teen dating violence (TDV), and that RAU and TDV co-occur at high rates, we know little about how to prevent these deleterious behaviors among SGMY. One promising approach to the prevention of RAU and TDV among SGMY is cross-cutting programs that teach SGMY how to intervene safely and effectively in situations of RAU and TDV. To date, however, we know little about factors that relate to bystander helping intentions in situations of RAU and TDV. The current study addressed this gap in the literature. Participants were 304 SGMY (ages 15-18) recruited online from across the United States who completed a baseline survey prior to participating in an online intervention to prevent RAU and TDV. Results suggested that, on average, SGMY reported high levels of bystander helping intentions in situations of RAU and TDV. RAU and proactive TDV bystander helping intentions were significantly correlated, but RAU and reactive TDV bystander helping intentions were unrelated. Further, there were differential correlates of bystander helping intentions in situations of RAU and TDV. More specifically, (a) higher rates of LGBTQ+ community connectedness were related to higher levels of reactive bystander intentions in situations of TDV; (b) higher depression, lower internalized homo/bi/transphobia, and lower levels of RAU were related to proactive bystander intentions in situations of TDV; and (c) low levels of emotional dysregulation and perceptions of higher rates of TDV perpetration among LGBTQ+ teens were related to bystander intentions in situations of RAU. The current study sheds light on modifiable factors that may be helpful in enhancing RAU and TDV bystander helping intentions and ultimately RAU and TDV among SGMY. Further, results support the importance of addressing both forms of bystander helping behaviors in developing efficacious interventions."

Patients often suffer from symptoms long before the diagnosis due to an overlap with other psychiatric differential diagnosis. Importantly, alcohol addiction and other illicit drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms mimicking ADHD symptoms should be ruled out. Here we present a rare case of a young female patient with symptoms of ADHD and an extremely high carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) of 19,6% (< 1,3%) indicating the presence of a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). A thorough diagnostic workup excluded alcohol addiction as a cause of the constantly high CDT levels. The CDT test was positive due a transferrin mutation affecting the glycosylation site. Nevertheless, psychiatric symptoms can be due to metabolic disorders which should be considered. Further, substance-use disorders (SUD) are a critical and potentially complicated differential diagnosis concerning diagnostic procedures and treatment in ADHD.",

Limited county-level availability of substance use treatment facilities may restrict access to care and ultimately contribute to worsening health outcomes and mortality. However, it is unknown whether the availability of such facilities is associated with county-level alcohol-attributable mortality risk. METHODS: We used Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial regression models to assess the relationship between population-weighted county-level treatment facility availability and rates of (1) fully chronic alcohol-attributable mortality, (2) alcohol poisonings, and (3) suicides by exposure to alcohol in 2019-2020. Localized treatment facility availability was calculated using a weighted method incorporating Census block group-level population counts. We adjusted for county-level demographic and socioeconomic factors, hospital density, population density, overall mortality rate, densities of mental health practitioner offices, U.S. Census region, year, and season. RESULTS: There was county-level heterogeneity in the availability of substance use treatment facilities, with northeastern county treatment facility densities at least twice as high as other regions. Higher county-level densities of treatment facilities were related to increased county-level risk for chronic fully alcohol-attributable deaths and alcohol poisonings but not suicides by exposure to alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of substance use treatment facilities and the services they offer is heterogeneous across U.S. counties. The positive relationship between population-weighted county-level densities of treatment facilities and chronic fully alcohol-attributable mortality and alcohol poisonings may suggest that treatment facilities are placed in areas of greatest demand; yet, population-level needs may not fully met by these facilities."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of kaempferol (KAE) on alcohol-induced neural injury and its underlying mechanism. C57BL/6 N mice were employed to develop a binge-on-chronic alcohol exposure model, with different doses of KAE as an interventional drug for 6 weeks. Neuronal damage and microglial activation in the brain, as well as colonic tissue damage and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations, were systematically assessed. Additionally, Caco-2 cells were exposed to alcohol to induce intestinal epithelial injury in vitro. Chronic alcohol exposure let to significant neuronal damage in the cortex and hippocampus of mice. KAE treatment effectively attenuated microglial activation and reduced neuronal damage in the brains of alcohol-exposed mice. Analysis of colonic tissues revealed that KAE administration inhibited miRNA-122a expression, alleviated pathological damage, and enhanced occludin expression, thereby significantly lowing serum LPS concentrations in alcohol-fed mice. In vitro, KAE markedly decreased miRNA-122a expression and enhanced occludin levels in Caco-2 cells treated with alcohol. Furthermore, overexpression of miRNA-122a was found to diminish occludin protein production in Caco-2 cells, which was significantly counteracted by KAE treatment. KAE treatment enhanced intestinal barrier function to alleviate neuronal damage caused by microglial activation mediated by gut-derived LPS under alcohol expose. This effect of KAE was involved in the enhance of intestinal occludin expression by inhibiting the expression of miRNA-122a. This suggested that KAE had the potential to prevent alcohol-induced neurological damage."

The goal of this study was to identify functional connectivity brain patterns underlying Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)-related characteristics in fifty-five adults (31 female) who endorsed heavy alcohol use. We hypothesized that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the Salience (SN), Frontoparietal (FPN), and Default Mode (DMN) networks would reflect self reported recent and lifetime alcohol use, laboratory-based alcohol seeking, urgency, and sociodemographic characteristics related to AUD. To test our hypothesis, we combined the triple network model (TNM) of psychopathology with a multivariate data-driven approach, regularized partial least squares (rPLS), to unfold concurrent functional connectivity (FC) patterns and their association with AUD characteristics. We observed three concurrent associations of interest: i) drinking and age-related cross communication between the SN and both the FPN and DMN; ii) family history density of AUD and urgency anticorrelations between the SN and FPN; and iii) alcohol seeking and sex-associated SN and DMN interactions. These findings demonstrate the utility of combining theory- and data-driven approaches to uncover associations between resting-state functional substrates and AUD-related characteristics that could aid in the identification, development, and testing of novel treatment targets across preclinical and clinical models."

      "abstract": "Paracancerous tissues (PCTs) were previously considered benign regions, but recent findings reveal genomic instability in these areas. Smoking and alcohol consumption are closely associated with esophageal cancer (EC) development. This study explored the interplay between the Hippo pathway and pyroptosis in EC, PCTs, and distal normal tissues (DNTs). We used molecular epidemiological methods to analyze the effects of smoking and alcohol on these pathways. We found that key genes in both pathways were more altered in smokers and/or drinkers compared to non-smokers and non-drinkers. Additionally, we observed changes in some genes and proteins in PCTs, while the Hippo pathway and pyroptosis had not yet been influenced. We applied 4.0% alcohol combined with various concentrations of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) to PCTs cultured in vitro to observe carcinogenesis and changes in these pathways. Verteporfin, as an inhibitor of YAP, was also used in vitro culture experiments to observe its effects on cellular carcinogenesis. Among 56 EC patients, 41 had a history of smoking and/or alcohol consumption in this study. Compared to DNTs, Hippo pathway genes (Lats1, Yap, and Taz) and pyroptosis genes (Nlrp3, Asc, Gsdmd, and Caspase-1) were altered in 49 EC tissues, while changes of Lats1, Nlrp3, and Asc were observed in 47 PCTs. Additionally, 4.0% alcohol combined with 3.2%, 4.0%, and 5.8% CSE, respectively, not only induced cellular heterogeneity and even cancerous transformation, but also suppressed the Hippo pathway and pyroptosis in the PCTs cultured in vitro. Furthermore, in vitro, 9 μM verteporfin inhibited cellular heterogeneity/carcinogenesis in PCTs induced by 4.0% alcohol combined with 5.8% CSE through inhibiting YAP and promoting pyroptosis. It is speculated that the downregulation of YAP could prevent smoking- and alcohol-induced carcinogenesis in esophageal PCTs by promoting pyroptosis, which may offer new insights for the treatment of esophageal squamous carcinoma.",

It primarily occurs when people unwittingly consume beverages contaminated with the chemical compound under the guise of alcoholic spirits. Although reliable data on its burden are unavailable, methanol poisoning is thought to be increasing globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Current scholarship related to methanol poisoning draws almost exclusively from clinical and epidemiological research traditions. In this article, and in the absence of anthropological scholarship examining methanol poisoning specifically, we provide a narrative review of anthropological and social science literature that bears on this growing phenomenon. METHODS: We bring key areas of anthropological thought and inquiry that coalesce around the social phenomenon of methanol poisoning in conversation with the clinical and epidemiological scholarship. RESULTS: We begin with a biographical account of methanol, an unlikely character which has become omnipresent in the material world. We then turn to a social scientific examination of alcohol consumption, to which methanol poisoning is tethered. We pay special attention to alcohol consumption in Muslim-majority settings, where alcohol is often proscribed, but methanol-related incidents are common. Subsequently, we examine the scholarship related to health systems and technologies, which come to bear on diagnostic and treatment encounters for those who have consumed toxic alcohol. CONCLUSION: We argue that anthropological perspectives are urgently needed to contribute to a fuller understanding of methanol poisoning and to design socially sensitive clinical and public health responses to address this avertable scourge.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a prevalent hereditary cardiac disorder characterized by marked myocardial hypertrophy, which may lead to impaired diastolic function and relative myocardial ischemia. On rare occasions, HCM coexists with coronary artery disease (CAD), complicating therapeutic decisions due to heightened risks of heart failure and ischemic events. Treatment options for these patients commonly include surgical myomectomy or alcohol septal ablation, traditionally performed using an over-the-wire (OTW) balloon catheter. Here, we present a case in which a modified 'block and delivery' alcohol septal ablation technique was utilized, instead of the conventional OTW approach, in a patient with concurrent HCM and CAD within a resource-limited setting. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old Asian female presented with angina and acute heart failure in our clinic. Diagnostic evaluations revealed hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) with severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) and significant coronary artery stenosis. Due to equipment constraints, the patient underwent staged interventions: a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) followed by alcohol septal ablation using a modified technique. This intervention effectively reduced the LVOT gradient from 108 to 17 mmHg. At the one-year follow-up, the patient demonstrated good health, complete symptom resolution, and a normal left ventricular outflow tract gradient. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the feasibility of employing a modified alcohol septal ablation technique in resource-limited settings, highlighting the importance of adaptable and innovative approaches in managing complex cardiac conditions."

The group interventions consisted of daily one-hour sessions over six days, addressing trauma related to IPV, psychoeducation, the need for treatment adherence, skills to prevent IPV, safety plans, self-care, resource mapping, and networking. A Composite Abuse Scale shorter version was used for screening for IPV. Psychological stress, wellbeing, social support, and help-seeking behavior scales were assessed before and after one month of the group intervention. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The mean age of IPV survivors was 34 years (±7). All the participants experienced physical, psychological, and sexual forms of IPV. post-test revealed a significant reduction in violence frequency (z = -4.938, p < 0.001), perceived stress (z = -4.776, p < 0.001), improved social support (z = -2.079, p = 0.038), help-seeking behavior (z = -3.634, p < 0.001), and psychological wellbeing (z = -4.759, p < 0.001) after the group intervention. CONCLUSION: Group intervention reduces the frequency of IPV and stress levels and enhances help-seeking behavior, psychological wellbeing, and social support among IPV survivors."

However, fibrosis improvement after cessation is not uniform and some patients do not improve. METHODS: Mice were fed high fat diet with 20% alcohol in the drinking water for 20 weeks (ALD) followed by 4 weeks of chow diet with plain water (resolution). scATAC-seq dataset was analyzed using Signac R package. Cebpb floxed mice received AAV-TBG-Cre or AAV-control at the time of alcohol cessation. Hepatocyte-macrophage and endothelial cell-hepatocytes crosstalk was investigated using a transwell co-culture system. To test the role of angiopoietin mice were treated with recombinant ANG-1 one week after alcohol cessation. RESULTS: We analyzed differentially accessible regions in hepatocytes from control, ALD, or 4 weeks post alcohol cessation mice and identified transcription factors activated in ALD that remained activated after alcohol withdrawal. The top hit was C/EBPβ. We found that hepatocyte specific Cebpb knockout at the time of alcohol cessation promoted fibrosis resolution. The resolution was mediated by altered hepatocyte-macrophage crosstalk. C/EBPβ suppressed the expression of CYP3A family of enzymes in hepatocytes and downstream macrophage collagen degradation ability. Cebpb knockout in hepatocytes promoted a pro-resolving phenotype in liver macrophages. We further identified upstream events leading to persistent C/EBPβ activation. C/EBPβ was induced by alcohol-mediated endothelial changes both during ALD development and resolution. Restoring endothelial cell function with angiopoietin-1 supplementation reduced C/EBPβ and promoted fibrosis resolution. CONCLUSION: Taken together, alcohol-induced C/EBPβ activation is a key driver of poor disease resolution in ALD and a promising target for patients who fail to recover after alcohol abstinence."

Bioactive compounds, celebrated for their potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective properties, have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for the management of MetALD. This review comprehensively examines the underlying mechanisms by which these compounds exert their effects, including the modulation of oxidative stress pathways, the enhancement of lipid metabolism, and the promotion of liver regeneration. Specific bioactive constituents, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and omega-3 fatty acids, have demonstrated potential in ameliorating hepatic steatosis and fibrosis associated with MetALD. Incorporating these natural compounds into treatment regimens presents a novel strategy for managing MetALD, with significant implications for both lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions. Future research should prioritize clinical trials, improvements in bioavailability, and investigations into the synergistic effects of multi-compound formulations to establish effective and sustainable treatment strategies for MetALD."

Physicochemical, mechanical and biological properties of OPL samples as well as crosslinked films were characterized. The results showed that OPL not only increased the cell viability of human skin fibroblasts but also promoted antibacterial activity. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, rheological and gel content results proved the crosslinking effect of OPL. Mechanical properties of FOPL2 and FOPL3 films was >2 times higher than FPL film. The viability of human skin fibroblast cells was higher than the control for all films, and antibacterial activity of the film FOPL3 was significantly higher compared to other films. Wound healing effect of FOPL3 film was evaluated in a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) infected full-thickness skin defect model in mice. The results showed a significantly lower wound area after 7,10,14 days of treatment compared to the control group treated by normal saline. The findings of this research enlighten wound healing potentials of oxidized pullulan to be used as a multifunctional ingredient for the development of future skin care biomaterials."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent among people experiencing homelessness with an estimated 29 %-63 % impacted by this disease. As the effects of alcohol further perpetuate cycles of homelessness, treatment of AUD among this population is an important area of research. Although treatment facilities and outpatient services exist, many unhoused individuals underutilize or lack engagement with these programs. To date, only a few studies have explored the lived experiences of individuals navigating pathways toward treatment for AUD from the streets. Therefore, a patient-centered understanding through the lens of individuals with lived experiences may help those embedded within addiction treatment networks better engage and care for people experiencing homelessness. METHODS: This study consisted of in-depth semi-structured interviews with people experiencing homelessness being treated at a residential treatment facility for AUD (N = 19). Thematic analysis was used to understand their perspectives regarding the intricacies of navigating into a residential treatment facility for AUD from the streets. Interview transcripts were analyzed using Nvivo software, and an open codebook which guided the analysis. RESULTS: Frequently described barriers to AUD treatment initiation, navigation, and maintenance were compiled into themes such as, \"alcohol as a method of escapism\", \"burden of navigation lies on the participant\", and \"gaps in knowledge and function of community resources.\" Facilitators to AUD treatment included, \"need for housing,\" \"linkage by good samaritans,\" \"internal faith,\" and \"being a role model and productive citizen.\" Attitudes that influenced engagement within the treatment network included \"self-efficacy,\" \"recognition of AUD risks,\" and \"medical mistrust.\" DISCUSSION: This study unveiled perceived internal and external structural barriers and facilitators that guide AUD treatment initiation, navigation, and maintenance from the streets. More so, it generated common attitudes that facilitate various levels of engagement within the AUD treatment network among people experiencing homelessness. Through the generosity of participants in sharing their stories, this study can aid in informing the development and implementation of effective treatment models focused on guiding people experiencing homelessness toward treatment and recovery."

      "abstract": "This article presents a method for synthesizing a polymer composite based on the interaction of PVA and HNa isolated from coals from the Shubarkol deposit (Karaganda, Kazakhstan). The study focuses on the macromolecular aspects of the formation of the polymer matrix structure and the effect of a natural modifier on the properties of the composite. Taking into account the concept of macromolecular design, the addition of small additives of HNa (2-10%) significantly changes the nature of intermolecular interactions in the solution, promoting the accelerated structuring of the polymer network. This is manifested in a decrease in the gelation time, which is confirmed by a kinetic analysis based on changes in the relative viscosity of the systems. It was found that the greatest increase in viscosity is achieved on the fifth day with a content of 10% HNa and pH = 7, which, on the fifth day, indicates a critical concentration of the modifier necessary for the formation of a stable spatial network of hydrogen bonds and ion-dipole interactions between the functional groups of PVA and HNa. Morphological studies using AFM showed that an increase in the HNa content leads to a significant smoothing of the composite surface, indicating the formation of a more homogeneous and dense structure. These changes are due to the reorganization of the macromolecular architecture under the influence of modifying additives. The adsorption characteristics of the composite were estimated by the maximum sorption capacity, which was 3.40 mmol/g for Cu(II) ions. The results emphasize that the targeted control of the structure at the macromolecular level allows the creation of polymeric materials with specified physicochemical properties that are effective for wastewater treatment from heavy metals. The study demonstrates the potential of macromolecular design as a tool for the development of polymer composites with improved performance characteristics and environmental significance."

The analysis encompasses both experimental and theoretical research articles, with a focus on recent decades, aiming to elucidate the potential and limitations of different fabrication approaches, structure-property relationships, and their applicability in the real world. The review begins by examining the advanced polymeric materials and strategies employed in the design and processing of membranes with tailored properties. Fundamental principles of membrane processes are introduced, with a focus on general modeling approaches for describing the fluid transport through membranes. A key aspect of discussion is the distinction between the membrane performance and process performance. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of PVA membranes in various applications is presented, particularly in environmental fields (e.g., fuel cell, water treatment, air purification, and food packaging) and biomedical domains (e.g., drug delivery systems, wound healing, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, hemodialysis and artificial organs, and ophthalmic and periodontal treatment). Special attention is given to the relationship between membranes' characteristics, such as material composition, structure, and processing parameters, and their overall performance, in terms of permeability, selectivity, and stability. Despite their promising properties, enhanced through innovative fabrication methods that expand their applicability, challenges remain in optimizing long-term stability, improving fouling resistance, and increasing process scalability. Therefore, further research is needed to develop novel modifications and composite structures that overcome these limitations and enhance the practical implementation of PVA-based membranes. By offering a systematic overview, this review aims to advance the understanding of PVA membrane fabrication, properties, and functionality, providing valuable insights for continued development and optimization in membrane technology."

      "abstract": "Background: Most animals display different defensive behavioral strategies during imminent or potential threats. These responses are relevant for understanding human behavioral disorders. In addition, α1 adrenergic receptors (α1ARs) are blocked by prazosin and regulate a diverse set of behaviors, including alcohol drinking related to anxiety in humans, alcohol intake in rats, responses to strong acute stresses (like restraint), and several forms of cognitive flexibility. However, the role of α1ARs in regulating panic-like escape behavior remains unexplored. Methods: Male and female Wistar rats were chronic alcohol drinkers and age-matched alcohol naïves. Animals received an injection of 0.75 mg/kg of prazosin or vehicle and then were exposed to the elevated T maze (ETM) to evaluate avoidance and escape behavior. One week later, animals underwent the light-dark test (LDT) and open field test. Results: α1AR inhibition with prazosin increased latency for escape in male and female alcohol drinkers, with no significant effects in alcohol-naïve controls. There were also interesting impacts from alcohol drinking, including a decrease in ETM avoidance in female but not male drinkers. In addition, prazosin increased latency to enter the dark in LDT in female drinkers and male naïves. Although prazosin also decreased the number of transitions in males, no differences were found in open-field locomotion. Conclusions: These results suggest that α1ARs mediate escape-like behavior in male and female alcohol drinkers, shedding light on a novel therapy for alcohol problems related to panic and anxiety."

However, many countries, including Belize, have limited national data on the availability of HH resources and healthcare worker (HCW) hand hygiene adherence (HHA) in healthcare facilities (HCFs). We conducted a study in the 11 largest public HCFs across Belize to evaluate access to HH resources and HHA before and after an intervention (provision of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) wall mounts and HH training). Descriptive statistics and multilevel logistic regressions were used to assess changes in HH resources and HHA from baseline to follow-up and explore factors associated with HHA. There was a 19 percent increase in rooms with functional wall-mounted ABHR dispensers (44% to 63%) post-intervention. HHA did not improve from baseline (52%) to follow-up (50%). Combining baseline and follow-up data, HHA was higher when ABHR and soap and water were present (aOR = 4.19, 95% CI = 2.11, 8.32) and when only ABHR was present (aOR = 3.85, 95% CI = 1.92, 7.72) compared with when soap and water were present alone. The decreased perceived risk of COVID-19 at follow-up may explain the null HHA findings. However, our assessment of HH resources and practices provides a useful foundation for future HH programs in HCFs.",

While moderate alcohol intake has been associated with potential metabolic benefits, excessive consumption is linked to IR and related disorders. This study examines the association between sociodemographic variables, health habits, and IR risk using validated metabolic indices. Methods: A dual-phase study was conducted, including a cross-sectional analysis of 139,634 Spanish workers and a retrospective longitudinal follow-up of 40,431 participants (2009-2019). Data on sociodemographic factors (age, sex and socioeconomic status) and health habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, diet and physical activity) were collected through standardized occupational health assessments. IR risk was assessed using the Triglyceride-Glucose Index (TyG), Metabolic Score for Insulin Resistance (METS-IR), and Single-Point Insulin Sensitivity Estimator (SPISE-IR). Binary logistic regression was used for statistical analysis. Results: Age, male sex, lower socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and low adherence to the Mediterranean diet were significantly associated with higher IR risk across all indices (p < 0.001). Alcohol consumption exhibited a dose-dependent relationship with IR, with excessive intake significantly increasing the risk of IR. Longitudinal data revealed a worsening IR profile over time, particularly among older, low-income and physically inactive individuals. Conclusions: Sociodemographic factors and lifestyle habits strongly influence IR. Preventive strategies focused on reducing alcohol consumption, smoking cessation and promoting physical activity and dietary improvements are essential to mitigate the risk of IR, especially in vulnerable populations. Further longitudinal studies are needed to establish causal relationships and refine intervention strategies."

METHODS: German medical care patients were screened for at-risk alcohol use and subthreshold depression. Over 6 months, ITE participants received 6 individualized feedback letters and weekly text messages. Primary outcome was change in a composite measure including problematic alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test consumption questions) and depressive symptoms (two subscales of the Patient-Health-Questionnaire-8) from baseline to 6, 12, and 24 months. Analyses were adjusted for education, setting, major depression, and baseline differences. RESULTS: Among eligible patients invited, 51 % agreed to participate; 40 % completed the baseline interview and were randomized to ITE (n = 64) or assessment only (n = 68). Within ITE participants, 73 % received all intervention components. A latent change model revealed a small, insignificant impact of study group on the composite measure at 6 (d = -0.49, β = -0.41, p = 0.06) and 12 months (d = -0.26, β = -0.22, p = 0.35), diminishing at 24 months (d = -0.06, β = -0.04, p = 0.88). Secondary analyses showed a non-significant trend at 6 months, suggesting possible effect modification by baseline major depression (β = 0.80, p = 0.098), with larger effects in those without major depression. LIMITATIONS: Self-reported outcomes; psychotherapy status unknown. DISCUSSION: ITE showed high adherence and overall small, although non-significant, intervention effects up to month 12. The potential effect moderation warrants further investigation in larger samples."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously reported that carbopol hydrogels incorporating indomethacin nanoparticles (IMC NPs) improved the low permeability and bioavailability of skin formulations in transdermal drug delivery systems. However, the combination of NPs with other types of hydrogels has not been sufficiently explored to date. Therefore, this study investigated propylene glycol (PG)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel as an alternative base to carbopol hydrogel for incorporating IMC NPs. METHODS: IMC NPs were prepared using bead milling treatment, and these NPs were incorporated into PG/PVA hydrogel (IMC-NP@PG/PVA hydrogel). The IMC concentration was measured using the HPLC method, and seven-week-old Wistar rats were used to evaluate skin absorption. RESULTS: Bead milling reduced the IMC particle size in the PG/PVA hydrogels to the nanoscale (30-200 nm) without altering its crystalline form. The IMC-NP@PG/PVA hydrogel exhibited enhanced uniformity, solubility, and drug release compared to the IMC microparticle-loaded PG/PVA hydrogel (IMC-MP@PG/PVA hydrogel), with a 1.44-fold greater area under the concentration-time curve. Transdermal permeability studies revealed that IMC-NP@PG/PVA had 2.36-fold higher absorption than the IMC-MP@PG/PVA hydrogel, with dissolved IMC permeating the skin. Pharmacokinetics in the rats showed significantly increased plasma levels, absorption rates, and bioavailability for IMC-NP@PG/PVA, demonstrating its superior delivery efficiency. Moreover, the skin absorption of IMC-NP@PG/PVA was higher than that of carbopol hydrogel. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential of PG/PVA hydrogels as an effective base for transdermal drug delivery systems based on NPs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (sAH) is a life-threatening condition with high mortality, where corticosteroid use is the only treatment that has shown short-term benefits. Pentoxifylline, an anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha agent, has been proposed for its potential to improve outcomes, especially in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). We aimed to evaluate the impact of pentoxifylline on mortality in patients with sAH and AKI in a well-characterised global cohort. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, registry-based study including patients meeting the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism clinical criteria for sAH and AKI. Mortality was the primary endpoint, with liver transplantation as a competing risk. Statistical analysis included Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. RESULTS: We included 525 patients from 20 centres across eight countries. The median age was 48 years, with 26.1% females, and 76.9% had a history of cirrhosis. Multivariable Cox regression models showed that pentoxifylline use was not associated with survival (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.69, p=0.291). Factors associated with mortality included age (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.36, p<0.001), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score at admission (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.08, p<0.001) and renal replacement therapy use (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.84, p=0.019). The main causes of death were multiple organ failure (42%), infections (10%), oesophageal varices bleeding (7%) and renal failure (6%). CONCLUSION: Pentoxifylline showed no significant benefit on mortality in patients with sAH and AKI. Further studies are needed to refine treatment strategies for this high-risk group."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: In the United States, nearly 80 % of the adult population reported lifetime alcohol use, with 50 % of those reporting alcohol consumption within the past 30 days in 2019. The expense of excess alcohol intake was estimated to have an annual associated healthcare cost of $28 billion, and there was greater than $221 billion in additional costs due to the detrimental effects of excess alcohol intake on productivity and societal setbacks over the last year. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) provides a major barrier for patients seeking medical treatment, because AUD is consistently regarded as one of the most stigmatized disorders globally. Provider-based discrimination toward patients with AUD may lead to providing a lower quality of care. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to assess whether patients with a history of AUD and/or positive blood alcohol content (BAC+) affect emergency department (ED) wait times. We hypothesized that patients presenting to the ED with AUD+/BAC+ would have longer wait times. Secondarily, we investigated the impacts of sociodemographics within these analyses. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the 2019-2021 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). Individuals' primary diagnosis had to be of musculoskeletal origin based on ICD-10 codes starting with 'S' for skeletal or bodily injuries or 'M' for diagnoses related to musculoskeletal or connective tissue conditions. Wait time was quantified from time of entry into the triage system to the time patients were seen by the first provider. We included data points with or without a recorded history of alcohol misuse or dependence (AUD+/-) in their chart and those with a positive or negative blood alcohol content (BAC+/-). RESULTS: ED wait times among individuals presenting with musculoskeletal injuries with a current history of AUD presenting with BAC- at the time of triage were not significantly different from those without a history of AUD. Individuals who were BAC+ at the time of triage had shorter wait times regardless of AUD history - and only AUD-/BAC+ had shorter wait times. Our binary regression and adjusted models showed that individuals who were AUD-/BAC+ had a significantly shorter wait time (minimum -18.43, standard error [SE]=1.92, t=-9.59, p<0.001; SE=2.97; t=-5.62, p<0.001) compared to individuals who were AUD-/BAC- respectively. Those who were AUD+/BAC+ also had shorter wait times compared to AUD-/BAC- (min=-11.11, SE=4.05; t=-2.75, p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study showed no significant difference in ED wait times between individuals with and without a history of AUD - indicating that AUD history does not delay being seen. Shorter wait times for those entering the ED BAC+ may be due to their immediate need for treatment due to toxicity or alcohol withdrawal syndrome, having more severe injuries, or harm prevention."

The double balloon technique overcomes hairpin curves in the proximal septal branches, while the perfusion balloon and microcatheter technique enables ablation of extremely small branches. The balloon screen technique facilitates access to small branches at acute angles. These methods were successfully applied to three patients with medically refractory HOCM, resulting in a significant reduction in left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradients and an improvement in symptoms. These novel techniques provide potential solutions for anatomically challenging cases, expanding the indications for ASA and improving clinical outcomes for patients with HOCM."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Managing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) requires adherence to lifestyle recommendations like a healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and limiting alcohol intake. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced barriers to maintaining these habits, including limited healthcare access, increased stress, and reduced physical activity. This study assessed adherence to lifestyle recommendations, with a focus on heavy episodic drinking (HED), among NCD patients during the pandemic in Arba Minch, Ethiopia, to identify areas for public health intervention. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 310 randomly selected NCD follow-up patients at Arba Minch General Hospital. The data was collected using the WHO STEPS and Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) tool from March 1 to April 30, 2022. Data analysis included both descriptive and inferential statistics (bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression). Confounding variables were identified and controlled for to ensure result accuracy. RESULTS: Adherence to lifestyle recommendations was found to be low, at just 16.1% [n=50, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (12.5-20.6%)]. The prevalence of HED was 12.6%, with a higher prevalence among males (18.4%) compared to females (7.4%). Recent alcohol consumption was reported by 29.0% of participants, and among these, 43.3% engaged in HED. Factors significantly associated with HED included male gender (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 2.63, 95% CI 1.11, 6.24), higher education level (AOR 2.91, 95% CI 1.11, 7.58), and current tobacco use (AOR 6.36, 95% CI 1.62, 25.04). Healthcare disruptions due to COVID-19 (AOR 3.28, 95% CI 1.16, 9.26) and COVID-19-related anxiety (AOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06, 1.56) were also linked to HED. CONCLUSION: The study revealed low adherence to lifestyle recommendationsand significant prevalence of HED among NCD patients during the pandemic. Associations between HED, healthcare disruptions, and anxiety highlight the critical role of mental health and healthcare access in risky behaviors. Targeted public health interventions are essential, including community-based alcohol reduction programs, improved mental health support, and stronger healthcare systems. Integrating mental health services and culturally sensitive health education and community engagement can help improve adherence to lifestyle recommendations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laryngeal dystonia (LD) is isolated task-specific focal dystonia, predominantly impairing speech production. Clinical observations and population survey studies have reported that up to 58% of patients with LD may have symptom improvement following alcohol intake. OBJECTIVES: To determine the objective characteristics of alcohol responsiveness in LD using a standardized alcohol challenge test and genetic testing. METHODS: A total of 109 patients with isolated focal LD participated in the study. Patients were administered two non-diluted drinks of 40-proof vodka 30 min apart, followed by assessments of voice symptoms, breath alcohol content, and side effects. Patients were considered alcohol-responsive (EtOH+) if their symptoms changed by ≥10% from baseline. Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify genetic variants associated with the alcohol responsiveness of LD. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the standardized alcohol challenge test without major adverse events. Fifty-two patients (47.7%) had an average of 44.4 ± 25.0% improvement of LD symptoms about 45 min after alcohol intake. Five genetic variants in GABAergic pathway-related genes were enriched in EtOH+ patients, and two of these, rs11644926 (ADCY7) and rs2230741 (ADCY9), were associated with the improvement of dystonic voice symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol responsiveness of LD symptoms is a robust feature related to the genes regulating the GABAergic synapses. This finding provides support for the evaluation of novel oral medications with mechanisms of action similar to alcohol for the treatment of patients with alcohol-responsive dystonia."

However, the association between these factors have not been investigated within a group of individuals with AUD. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to investigate associations between emotion regulation, depressive symptoms and positive mental imagery among individuals with AUD and healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: The study sample included 136 individuals with AUD and 80 HCs. Severity of depressive symptoms was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and emotion dysregulation - with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). The Flexible Emotion Regulation Scale (FlexER) was used to measure flexible emotion regulation and the Prospective Imagery Task (PIT) - to assess positive mental imagery. RESULTS: Vividness of positive mental imagery was significantly lower in the AUD group compared to HC group, while emotional intensity of positive mental imagery was significantly higher in the AUD group. Higher vividness of positive mental imagery was associated with lower emotional dysregulation in the AUD group and with higher flexibility of emotion regulation among both groups. Emotional intensity of positive mental imagery was positively correlated with flexibility of emotion regulation in the AUD group, but negatively correlated with flexibility of emotion regulation among HCs. In the AUD group, both vividness and emotional intensity of positive mental imagery were significantly associated with lower severity of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing positive mental imagery abilities might be a promising strategy in the treatment of AUD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sometimes complicates left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction. Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is indicated for drug-refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Moreover, with an aging population, aortic valve stenosis (AS) is increasing, and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is indicated in these cases. Both AS and HOCM have stenosis at the exit of the LV and there is a difference in valvular and/or muscular stenosis. However, it is not clear how the release of stenosis affects blood flow. We investigate the influence of ASA and SAVR on blood flow using four-dimensional flow phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D flow MRI). METHODS: In this single-center retrospective observational study, we evaluated the blood flow of eight patients (five patients with HOCM and three patients with AS) before and after the intervention using 4D flow MRI. RESULTS: The LV-aortic pressure gradient (PG) significantly improved from 79.4 ± 3.9 to 23.0 ± 2.0 mmHg (p < 0.001) by SAVR in the patients with AS. However, turbulent kinetic energy value (TKE) loss was not improved. However, the intra-LV PG in patients with HOCM improved from 79.0 ± 54.2 to 8.7 ± 4.0 mmHg (p < 0.05) by ASA. TKE loss improved from 7.0 ± 2.0 to 5.0 ± 0.1 mW (p < 0.05) and New York Heart Association functional class significantly improved from 2.2 ± 0.5 to 1.1 ± 0.3 (p < 0.001) by ASA. CONCLUSIONS: The release of valvular or muscular stenosis has different effects on intra-LV blood flow. ASA reduced TKE loss and 4D flow MRI is useful to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) with steatosis or steatohepatitis that could progress to liver cirrhosis is a common problem in chronic alcohol consumption. Pemafibrate is a novel, highly specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) modulator, which regulates the expression of the target genes related to lipid and glucose metabolism. Here, we evaluated the effect of pemafibrate to prevent ALD and steatosis in rats. METHODS: The animals were treated with liquid diet containing ethanol (36% of total calories) or an isocaloric carbohydrate diet for 4 weeks. Subsequently, both groups were fed with either 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose solution (MC) or MC containing 0.3 mg/kg body weight of pemafibrate orally twice a day along with the liquid diet for another 4 weeks. A set of animals were sacrificed at the 4th week before the start of pemafibrate treatment and the remaining animals at the end of 8 weeks. Blood and liver samples were collected for biochemical and histopathological evaluations. RESULTS: Treatment with pemafibrate prevented inflammation and steatosis in the hepatic tissue. Furthermore, pemafibrate administration markedly increased hepatic NAD and NADH levels, reduced both serum and hepatic triglyceride levels, and upregulated the expression of molecules involved in lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrated that pemafibrate modulates target genes related to hepatic lipid metabolism and prevents deposition of fat globules in the liver during chronic alcohol feeding in rats. Therefore, pemafibrate could be used as a potent therapeutic agent to prevent steatosis and related adverse events in ALD.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of alcohol affects 400 million people worldwide, where it is responsible for 7% of deaths. Treatment success rates in this field remain limited. Only 15% of those who need treatment get it. Despite treatment, alcohol intake reoccurs in up to 90% of the cases. The use of disulfiram in preventing alcohol reoccurrence is attributed to its unique mechanism of action as an aversive agent, which causes the patient to experience unpleasant physical symptoms when they consume alcohol. The objective of this study is to confirm and illustrate the efficacy of disulfiram in combination with non-pharmacological intervention for persons with severe AUD. Clinical data from 45 patients of an outpatient treatment programme, including the application of disulfiram (2011-2023) were analysed to assess abstinence rates, craving impact, and demographic factors. Moreover, our analyses aimed to identify predictors and moderators of continuous abstinence duration. The study cohort comprised patients with severe AUD and high rates of comorbidities, the majority of which were affective disorders. During treatment, 50% of patients remained abstinent for at least 1 year. No significant differences were identified in craving, sex or comorbidities compared with those who experienced a return to substance use after treatment initiation. Disulfiram underlined its efficacy and tolerability as an adjunct to addiction-focused treatment in a typical clinical cohort of patients severely affected by AUD. Moreover, our analyses align with previous research indicating that disulfiram appears to allow patients with AUD to resist craving episodes, therefore avoiding impulsive reoccurrences of alcohol intake.",

Microencapsulation in alginate has been shown to protect transplanted cells from physical stress and rejection, but the poor biocompatibility of alginate can lead to graft failure. This study aimed to evaluate a biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-based microcapsule against standard alginate for improved transplantation outcome of liver spheroids. Materials and Methods: Human hepatocyte spheroids were microencapsulated in alginate or PVA hydrogel microspheres. Viability and function (albumin secretion and CYP activity) of the encapsulated spheroids were assessed in vitro at 3, 10, and 30 days postencapsulation and compared with unencapsulated spheroids. Spheroids were implanted intraperitoneally into immunodeficient mice, and human albumin levels in serum were monitored over 30 days. Cell-free microspheres were implanted in immune-competent mice to assess material biocompatibility. Results: Unencapsulated spheroids aggregated extensively beyond 10 days, precluding day 30 assessment. At day 30, PVA spheroids showed significantly higher CYP1A1 induction, albumin secretion, and metabolic activity compared with alginate. Mice receiving PVA spheroids had significantly higher serum albumin after 30 days compared with alginate and unencapsulated spheroids. Empty PVA microspheres showed less evidence of foreign body response in vivo, whereas thicker regions of inflamed tissue were observed in the alginate group. Conclusions: PVA-encapsulated hepatocyte spheroids maintained better overall viability, metabolic activity, and function compared with alginate-encapsulated cells both in vitro and in vivo. Both encapsulated groups demonstrated substantially improved outcomes compared with unencapsulated cells."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alcohol exposure has been shown to have complex, and sometimes paradoxical, associations with various serious diseases. Currently, there is no knowledge about the effects of alcohol exposure on the dynamics of oral microbial communities. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate the effects of chronic alcohol consumption on the diversity and composition dynamics of the rat oral microbiota using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. METHODS: In our study, there were 2 groups, including a control group (C group) and an alcohol group (A group), with 10 rats in every group. For ten weeks, rats in the A group were treated with alcohol intragastrically every day, whereas rats in the C group got water. After 10 weeks, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Oral swabs were taken from both groups, and total DNA was extracted for high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: According to the results obtained from our study, significant differences were observed in the relative abundances of microbial communities. Alpha diversity measures were statistically significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the A group compared to the C group. At the genus level, alcohol exposure altered the relative abundance of several microbes, including increased relative abundance of unidentified_Chloroplast, Acinetobacter, Vibrio, Romboutsia, Pseudoalteromonas, Aeromonas, Ralstonia, Turicibacter, Shewanella, and Bacteroides. Conversely, Haemophilus and Streptococcus were significantly less abundant in the A group. CONCLUSION: Alcohol exposure was associated with the diversity and composition of the oral microbiome. These findings contribute to our understanding of the potential role of oral bacteria in alcohol-related oral and systemic diseases, providing foundational work for future prevention and intervention studies.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of sub-effective doses of these derivatives in double and triple combination forms on PAH in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty nine rats were divided into seven groups (n=7): 1) control, 2) monocrotaline (MCT), 3) MCT+vehicle (veh), 4) MCT+BP, 5) MCT+PQ, 6) MCT+BQ, and 7) MCT+BPQ. After three weeks of PAH induction with MCT (60 mg/kg), either vehicle (ethanol 5% in saline) or one of the above combinations (dose of 20 mg/kg for B, and doses of 20 and 10 mg/ kg for P and Q in vehicle) was administered for three weeks. Right ventricular (RV) pressure, contractility indices, lung pathology, miR-204 expression, oxidative stress markers, inflammation and apoptosis were assayed. RESULTS: MCT increased RV systolic pressure and hypertrophy, and lung arteriole wall thickness, fibrosis and leukocyte infiltration in the MCT group compared to the CTL group. All treatments improved these effects significantly. Furthermore, MCT reduced antioxidant factors, Bax, P21 and miR-204 expression and increased Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Bcl-2. All of these effects were recovered by combination treatments. CONCLUSION: The results showed that combination therapy with sub-effective/ineffective doses of these compounds had ameliorative effects against PAH."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The \"Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption\" (AUDIT-C), designed for primary-care screening, is frequently repurposed for outcome monitoring in brief intervention trials targeting problematic alcohol use. This repurposing may distort the instrument's internal structure and introduce right censoring, potentially undermining its ability to meaningfully capture problematic use and change thereof. The aim of the current study was to examine these concerns. DESIGN: Psychometric study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from three sources were used: (1) individual-participant data from an internet-based brief intervention trial (n = 1169); (2) aggregated data from k = 15 additional brief intervention trials; and (3) k = 20 000 simulated cohorts generated using statistics from general-population samples. MEASUREMENTS: Internal structure of the AUDIT-C was examined through cross-item correlations, item step response functions (ISRF), and more. Responsiveness was assessed using interaction analysis, with changes in alcohol standard units (SUt2-t1) as the outcome, AUDIT-Ct2-t1 and baseline SU as predictors, and further probing using a simple slopes approach. FINDINGS: In contrast to general-population cohorts, most brief intervention trials (68.8%) exhibited non-positive associations between frequency and quantity items. Congruently, ISRFs revealed non-monotonic patterns, disrupting ordinal measurement. Simulations suggested that negative frequency-quantity correlations appear at cut-offs of four (r = -0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.019 - -0.068) or three (r = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.101 - -0.149). A one-unit AUDIT-Ct2-t1 change represented greater average change in SUt2-t1 at higher baseline consumption, supported by an interaction (β = 0.05, SE = 0.02, p = 0.005) and sequential contrasts between simple slopes (e.g. 80th vs. 90th percentile: β = 0.31, SE = 0.11, p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: When used with typical brief intervention samples, using the AUDIT-C for outcome monitoring risks right-censoring (and thereby false negatives) and non-meaningful total scores. Researchers and clinicians should reconsider repurposing the AUDIT-C as an outcome measure in future alcohol intervention studies and re-examine prior trials that relied on it, to improve the quality of evidence."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is common in hospital patients. AUD medications are not typically initiated in that setting. The comparative effectiveness between initiation of oral naltrexone and extended-release injectable naltrexone in the hospital is not known. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of initiating oral naltrexone vs extended-release injectable naltrexone on reduction in alcohol use and health care utilization among medical inpatients with AUD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Alcohol Disorder Hospital Treatment (ADOPT) study is a randomized clinical trial conducted at an urban teaching hospital in the US, with enrollment between June 2016 and March 2020. Inpatients were screened for eligibility, and those with AUD and recent heavy drinking (defined as 5 or more drinks for men and 4 or more drinks for women) were enrolled. Outcomes were assessed at 3-month follow-up; assessors were not blinded to treatment assignment. Data were analyzed from May 2021 to September 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received either daily oral naltrexone or monthly extended-release injectable naltrexone. All received medical management with a research nurse who specialized in addiction. MAIN MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was change in percentage of heavy drinking days (HDDs) over the past 30 days from baseline to 3-month follow-up, assessed by validated instrument. The secondary outcome was any acute health care utilization (emergency department or hospitalization) at 3-month follow-up over the past 90 days. RESULTS: Of 248 participants, 199 (80.2%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 49.4 (10.4) years. The baseline median (IQR) percentage of HDDs in the past 30 days was 80.0% (43.3-100). At 3-month follow-up, the mean percentage of HDDs in the past 30 days was reduced in both groups (oral naltrexone: baseline, 66.7% HDDs; 3-month follow-up, 27.4% HDDs; difference, -38.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -125.0 to 48.2; extended-release injectable naltrexone: baseline, 70.7% HDDs; 3-month follow-up, 23.8% HDDs; difference, -46.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -123.4 to 30.6; P = .14). At follow-up, 59 of 109 in the oral naltrexone arm (54.1%) and 66 of 108 in the extended-release injectable naltrexone arm (61.1%) reported acute health care utilization in the prior 3 months; the odds of this utilization were not significantly different between groups (adjusted odds ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.77-2.33). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, when initiated at hospital discharge, oral and extended-release injectable naltrexone did not differ in effectiveness. Participants had substantial reductions in HDDs in both treatment groups; however, there was not a significant difference in the reduction of percentage of HDDs in the past 30 days or acute health care utilization between groups. Hospitalization represents an opportunity to start AUD pharmacotherapy; choice of oral naltrexone vs extended-release injectable naltrexone should be directed by factors such as patient preference and insurance.

This study aimed to develop and optimize a nanoencapsulated system for intranasal delivery of temozolomide (TMZ) and perillyl alcohol (POH), designed to circumvent BBB limitations, utilizing Eudragit RS100 as the encapsulation matrix. A factorial design approach optimized key parameters, including Eudragit RS100 concentration, POH amount, drip rate, and organic-to-aqueous phase ratio. The nanocapsules were characterized by dynamic light scattering, zeta potential analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The optimized nanocapsules demonstrated a mean diameter of 253 ± 52 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.145 ± 0.037, indicating uniform size distribution. A zeta potential of approximately +20 mV supported colloidal stability. Encapsulation efficiencies were 3.7% for POH and 28.5% for TMZ. This nanoencapsulated delivery system offers a promising approach for glioblastoma treatment, potentially enhancing clinical outcomes and reducing treatment-associated toxicity."

      "abstract": "Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a severe form of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) characterized by acute-onset jaundice and liver failure, which carries a high mortality risk, particularly in cases of severe AH (sAH). Although glucocorticoids have been the primary pharmacologic intervention for decades, their use is limited by a lack of long-term efficacy and significant side effects and relative contraindications. For patients who do not respond to glucocorticoids, early liver transplantation (eLT) is a life-saving option, yet only a few patients qualify for this intervention. In recent years, advances in translational medicine have uncovered key mechanisms in AH pathophysiology, including microbiome interactions, proinflammatory signaling, and disruptions in hepatocyte function. These insights have led to the exploration of innovative pharmacologic treatments, targeting pathways such as the gut-liver axis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and liver regeneration. Despite promising results from ongoing clinical trials, several challenges persist, including low patient recruitment and retention rates, heterogeneity in trial design, and the lack of standardized endpoints. This review assesses the current pharmacologic landscape of AH, emphasizing emerging therapies and the ongoing challenges in AH clinical trials."

      "abstract": "For over a millennium, the leaves of Ampelopsis grossedentata (Hand.-Mazz.) W. T. Wang, commonly known as vine tea, have been revered as a popular tea and traditional herbal remedy, possessing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and antiviral properties. In recent years, the incidence of alcohol-related liver injury has been on the rise, imposing a significant public health burden worldwide. Previous studies have indicated that extracts of vine tea (AGE) can ameliorate alcoholic liver disease (ALD), yet the pharmacological mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly understood. In this study, we first employed UPLC-Q-TOF-MS to analyze the chemical constituents of AGE. Subsequently, an ALD model was established in mice fed with Lieber-DeCarli diet, and the hepatoprotective benefits of AGE were assessed by measuring biochemical indicators and hepatic pathological changes. Moreover, a suite of bioinformatics tools, including transcriptomics, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and single-cell data mining, were utilized to reveal that the YTHDF2/PGC-1α/SIRT3 signaling axis may be the potential mechanism by which AGE exerts its anti-ALD effects. Additionally, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining techniques were employed to further substantiate the aforementioned mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that administration of vine tea significantly alleviated chronic ethanol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Notably, knockdown of YTHDF2 partially protected the liver from ethanol-induced injury. Mechanistically, bioinformatics analysis and in vitro and in vivo experiments identified YTHDF2 as a key pharmacological target of AGE in treating ALD, acting through the downstream PGC-1α/SIRT3 pathway. In summary, in this study, we provide the first evidence that AGE mitigates ethanol-induced liver injury by inhibiting YTHDF2 and enhancing the expression of PGC-1α and SIRT3. Vine tea, as a tea food with unique medicinal value, shows significant potential and value in the treatment of ALD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress maintains problematic alcohol use, so it is particularly important to identify interventions that effectively reduce the desire for alcohol even in the context of high stress. Reinforcer Pathology Theory suggests that stress increases alcohol demand by inducing short-term thinking. One intervention that targets this mechanism is episodic future thinking (EFT), which involves vividly imagining personal future events and has been shown to reduce short-term thinking and accompanying preferences for immediate rewards like alcohol. These shared mechanisms suggest that EFT may be particularly effective at reducing alcohol demand in the context of higher stress. This study first assessed the relationship of stress with preference for immediate rewards and alcohol demand, and the impact of EFT on preference for immediate rewards and alcohol demand. This study then tested whether EFT may be particularly effective in the context of higher stress. METHODS: One hundred thirty-nine adults with problematic alcohol use completed an online survey through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), including self-report measures of past month stress and baseline momentary stress, an EFT or episodic recent thinking (ERT) procedure, a delay-discounting task, and an alcohol purchase task. Univariate correlations assessed the relationship of stress with delay discounting and alcohol demand intensity. Path analyses assessed hypothesized models relating EFT/ERT, stress, delay discounting, and demand intensity. RESULTS: Consistent with Reinforcer Pathology Theory, higher baseline momentary stress was correlated with increased preference for immediate rewards. EFT intervention increased preference for delayed rewards, which contributed to decreased alcohol demand. However, the effect of EFT on delay discounting was not moderated by stress. CONCLUSIONS: EFT does not appear uniquely effective at reducing desire for alcohol in the context of higher stress, but equally, EFT's efficacy was not significantly affected by stress level. Findings emphasize the opposing roles of state stress and EFT in the behavioral economics underlying problematic alcohol use."

We present the case of a 65-year-old woman with HOCM concomitant with midventricular obstruction and anomalous PMs. She was referred to our hospital for septal reduction therapy to alleviate recurrent syncope, chest pain, and heart failure symptoms. ASA was performed to ablate the left ventricular (LV) myocardium from the base to the middle via 6 septal branches. The pressure gradient in the LV outflow tract decreased considerably, and midventricular obstruction persisted immediately after ASA. There were no recurrent episodes of syncope or chest pain, and the heart failure-related symptoms improved. Eighteen months later, the LV outflow tract and midventricular obstructions were relieved. This case indicates that ASA is an alternative option to relieve symptoms, even if anomalous PMs and midventricular obstruction coexist in HOCM."

However, little research has investigated NE in individuals with comorbid AUD/PTSD. We compared psychological and biological markers of NE phenotypes, and alcohol-related outcomes between individuals with AUD with and without PTSD, and healthy controls. Additionally, we evaluated whether childhood trauma severity moderated these relationships. Participants [N = 1292; healthy controls (HC): n = 502 (38.9%); AUD only: n = 610 (47.2%), and AUD/PTSD (CMB); n = 180 (13.9%)] enrolled in the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Natural History Protocol underwent clinical, biological and behavioural phenotyping that included psychiatric diagnoses, markers of negative emotionality and allostatic load, alcohol use behaviour, and history of childhood trauma. The CMB group had the most severe alcohol use and childhood trauma history. Psychological NE were the most dysregulated among the CMB group. Biological markers of NE were also dysregulated among the AUD and CMB group, where they displayed greater resting heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and HDL cholesterol relative to HC. Greater childhood trauma severity was associated with greater psychological NE. However, the childhood trauma did not moderate any relationship between diagnosis and NE phenotypes. These results highlight important differences in NE, childhood trauma and alcohol use in individuals with AUD with and without comorbid PTSD. Targeting NE and alcohol-related behaviours is critical in effective treatment of individuals with comorbid AUD/PTSD. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02231840.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Polydrug use has caused serious harm to public health, especially involving novel psychoactive substances. Tiletamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist commonly used as a veterinary anesthetic, has recently emerged in China as an additive in e-cigarettes. However, the long-term impacts of tiletamine and its combined use with other substances remain poorly understood. This case report aims to provide further insight into the clinical manifestations and treatment of tiletamine abuse, particularly focusing on the tremors induced by polydrug use. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient had five years of intermittent alcohol use and five months of etomidate abuse. After combining tiletamine for two months, he was repeatedly hospitalized due to coarse tremors, poor sleep and appetite. Based on his substance use pattern and related outcomes, he was diagnosed with phencyclidine use disorder. Initially, intravenous diazepam (20 mg/day) effectively alleviated the tremors. During the second hospitalization, the same dose took longer to take effect, and by the third hospitalization, the dose was increased to 30 mg/day without reducing the tremors. Therefore, primidone was added and gradually titrated to 50 mg/day. The patient's tremors began to improve by the eighth day and significantly diminished by the tenth day. As we gradually replaced diazepam with lorazepam, the patient insisted on discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Polydrug users, particularly those using NMDAR antagonists and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA-AR) agonists, may be at increased risk of developing tiletamine dependence, with more severe consequences due to cross-addiction. The combination of alcohol and tiletamine could exacerbate neuroexcitotoxicity during withdrawal, potentially contributing to severe tremors. The successful management of tremors with a combination of neuroinhibitory therapies suggested an effective strategy for complex cases. Further studies are needed to better understand the long-term impacts and risks of tiletamine dependence."

The neural underpinnings of these behaviors are not entirely understood, but orexin has emerged as a candidate target for the treatment of substance use disorders. Here, we explored changes in orexin system-related gene expression in brain regions important for mediating reward and stress, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and extended amygdala (including the central amygdala, nucleus accumbens shell, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis), in adolescent and adult female Wistar rats following chronic alcohol exposure. We observed higher numbers of Hcrtr1- (orexin receptor 1)-expressing neurons in the VTA of adolescent and adult female rats during withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure. The number of Hcrt1+ VTA neurons was negatively correlated with thermal sensitivity in adolescent female rats and anxiety-like behavior in adult female rats. These data suggest that chronic alcohol effects on orexin receptor expression in the VTA are related to specific behaviors that manifest during withdrawal, highlighting potential avenues for targeting alcohol withdrawal-associated behaviors across development."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex psychiatric condition with limited effective treatment options. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have emerged as potential AUD treatment, as they have been shown to modulate reward-related behaviours, including those linked to alcohol consumption. However, the underlying mechanisms and neurocircuitry remain unclear. This study investigated the role of GLP-1R in the lateral septum (LS), a brain region highly expressing GLP-1R and implicated in reward-related behaviours, including alcohol-induced reward and consumption. METHODS: Behavioural, neurochemical, molecular, and electrophysiological methods were used to investigate the effect of LS GLP-1R signalling in alcohol-mediated responses in rodents. FINDINGS: LS GLP-1R activation attenuated alcohol's rewarding effects, reducing locomotor stimulation, place preference, and accumbal dopamine release. Intra-LS infusion of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (Ex4) reduced alcohol intake dose-dependently without affecting food or water consumption, while GLP-1R inhibition increased alcohol intake. Furthermore, LS GLP-1R expression correlated with alcohol intake in male but not female rats, suggesting sex-specific effects of long-term alcohol exposure. Ex vivo electrophysiology indicated that GLP-1R activation depressed LS neurotransmission via a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor-dependent mechanism. INTERPRETATION: This study provides new insights into how GLP-1R agonists may reduce alcohol intake. Overall, the findings underscore the potentially inhibitory neuromodulatory role of LS GLP-1R in regulating alcohol consumption through the modulation of dopaminergic reward processes tentatively involving GABA transmission.

ALD comprises a wide disease spectrum, from the benign liver steatosis, to the life-threatening inflammatory acute phenotype of alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and ultimately, advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. AH represents an acute inflammatory liver condition caused by prolonged high quantities of alcohol intake. Disease outcome varies from mild to severe, with systemic implication and high mortality. Although the pathogenesis has been extensively studied over the years, little progress has been made regarding therapeutic options. In over 50 years, steroid treatment is still the cornerstone therapeutic option, albeit having multiple limitations and a low success rate. On the other hand, important progress has been made regarding disease management and severity stratification with the implementation of different prognostic score. Although highly prevalent, AH still has many unmet needs, with a growing necessity for novel non-invasive diagnosis, prognosis biomarkers and impactful treatment options."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is one of the leading causes of alcohol-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Unfortunately, limited therapeutic options are currently available, due to the complex risk factors involved as well as the lack of information on the molecular mechanisms driving its progression. Interestingly, chronic, excessive alcohol intake has been reported to exacerbate the severity of Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a respiratory disorder typically characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). However, this relationship between alcohol-enhanced OSA and ALD development/progression remains to be elucidated. METHODS: As an approach to investigate this relationship in vivo Gao-binge ALD and CIH mouse models were established. Alcohol-related liver injury, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and oxidative stress were then assessed in these models. In addition, LPS and ethanol-co-treated AML12 hepatocytes served as an in vitro model to investigate the mechanisms through which CIH affects ethanol-induced liver injury. RESULTS: CIH intervention ameliorated alcohol-related liver injury, reduced hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative stress and alleviated liver inflammation. Mechanistically, in the liver of these Gao-binge mice, CIH intervention inhibited alcohol-induced upregulation and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α), a protein which plays a key role in hepatic lipid metabolism and liver injury. Similar to these effects observed in response to CIH intervention, treatment of Gao-binge mice with the selective inhibitor of HIF-2α, PT2385, alleviated alcohol-related liver injury and steatosis while inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation. Additional findings from our in vitro model revealed that CIH downregulated HIF-2α by promoting calpains protein expression, thereby reducing the accumulation of lipid droplets and decreasing ROS production in AML12 cells co-challenged with LPS and ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: The above results provide important, new evidence that re-conceptualizes the role of alcohol-enhanced OSA in ALD progression. Moreover, these findings can serve as the foundation for the development of HIF-2α inhibitors for use in the prevention and treatment of ALD."

A mixed-methods substudy was embedded in an implementation science trial to assess perceived satisfaction and acceptability of the Women's Health CoOp (WHC), a gender-focused, alcohol and harmful substance use, HIV biobehavioural intervention in Cape Town, South Africa. A modified version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)® was used to assess patient satisfaction (N = 456). Eight focus groups were also conducted to assess the perceived acceptability and satisfaction of the WHC after completion of the intervention workshops. Participants reported being very pleased with the WHC with an acceptable internal consistency estimate (α = .81). Intervention satisfaction was high (M = 30.9; SD = 0.1) on the CSQ-8 scale. Focus group participants reported that the WHC helped them reduce the amount and frequency of heavy alcohol use. Knowledge gained through the WHC reduced misperceptions about mixing alcohol with antiretroviral therapy and motivated re-engagement in HIV care. Participants also reported a decrease in condomless sex. Interventions that support and empower women living with HIV reporting heavy alcohol use should be implemented sustainably to improve HIV treatment retention and re-engagement and to reduce alcohol consumption among this population.",

The average number of new blood vessels formed in the collagen-chitosan-PVA membrane on days 7, 14, and 30 was greater than that in the pericardial membrane and cross-linked pericardial membrane, which was statistically significant (p < 0.005). The average number of inflammatory cells in the collagen-chitosan-PVA membrane on day 30 was lower than that in the pericardial membrane and cross-linked pericardial membrane, which was statistically significant (p < 0.005) for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) for eosinophils and mast cells.Biodegradation, angiogenesis, and the inflammatory response in collagen-chitosan-PVA membranes showed better results compared with other membranes. Collagen-chitosan-PVA membranes exhibit potential for application in guided tissue regeneration treatment for periodontal disease."

This is especially true for young Native women in urban settings, where over 70% of the population resides, yet their experiences are rarely accounted for in research. We conducted remote in-depth interviews from March to May 2022, roughly concurrent with the Omicron surge and relaxed lockdown measures, with a subsample of 15 urban Native young women ages 16-20 who were participating in a national randomized controlled trial of an AEP preventive intervention. Participants were asked how the pandemic affected their use of alcohol, sexual health, mental health, and relationships. A qualitative analysis revealed diverse experiences during the pandemic. While some participants experienced greater risks for AEP due to increased alcohol use and reduced access to birth control, other participants drank less alcohol and had greater access to birth control. Additionally, while some participants faced mental health challenges due to isolation and relational strains that emerged during the pandemic, others found the pandemic to be a time that afforded self-reflection, self-development, and a deepening of relationships.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As alcohol misuse remains pervasive within the military, evidence-based prevention programs that are feasible to implement and appropriately tailored to meet the needs and norms of military personnel are critically needed. Further, programs that target future military leaders, such as trainees, recruits, and cadets, may be especially impactful. eCHECKUP TO GO is a web-based, evidence-based brief alcohol intervention designed to reduce alcohol misuse through education and personalized feedback that may be suitable for military trainees. However, because it was developed for civilian students, efforts to adapt the content for military settings are needed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of a military version of eCHECKUP TO GO, tailored to include military-specific terminology and alcohol use statistics. METHODS: US Air Force Academy cadets were recruited to participate in a single-arm, mixed methods study. Following the completion of eCHECKUP TO GO, participants completed a survey that assessed satisfaction with specific aspects of the user experience, including ease of use, design, and relevance of the information and personalized feedback (range: 1=strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree). A subset of cadets also participated in a focus group to expound on the survey responses. RESULTS: Survey participants included 22 cadets (n=12, 55% male; mean age 19.6, SD 1.8 years). In addition, 6 (27%) cadets participated in the focus group. Participants were satisfied with the program overall (mean 5.8, SD 0.9) and gave the highest ratings to ease of use (mean 6.6, SD 0.7), site design (mean 6.5, SD 0.6), and site interactivity (mean 6.4, SD 1.0). Items pertaining to tailoring, relevance, and amount of content specific to cadets scored lowest (mean 5.8, SD 1.4; mean 5.6, SD 1.4; and mean 5.5, SD 1.5, respectively). Most (n=15, 68%) participants said they would act upon the information they were provided. Focus group participants made suggestions for improved tailoring, such as increasing content on social aspects of drinking and military-specific risks of alcohol misuse (eg, Uniform Code of Military Justice violations). CONCLUSIONS: Although the acceptability of eCHECKUP TO GO was high, continued efforts are needed to ensure the content accurately reflects the experiences of cadets. Researchers who design military health promotion interventions need to consider the varied contexts within the force and rigorously evaluate the acceptability of all content before implementation.",

Similarly, the beneficial effects of nitrate on alcohol-induced cognitive decline and the roles of the oral microbiota merit investigation. Here we found that nitrate supplementation effectively mitigated cognitive impairment induced by chronic alcohol exposure in mice, reducing both systemic and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, nitrate restored the dysbiosis of the oral microbiota caused by alcohol consumption. Notably, removing the oral microbiota led to a subsequent loss of the beneficial effects of nitrate. Oral microbiota from donor alcohol use disordered humans who had been taking the nitrate intervention were transplanted into germ-free mice which then showed increased cognitive function and reduced neuroinflammation. Finally, we examined 63 alcohol drinkers with varying levels of cognitive impairment and found that lower concentrations of nitrate metabolism-related bacteria were associated with higher cognitive impairment and lower nitrate levels in plasma. These findings highlight the protective role of nitrate against alcohol-induced cognition impairment and neuroinflammation and suggest that the oral microbiota associated with nitrate metabolism and brain function may form part of a \"microbiota-mouth-brain axis\".",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Evidence suggests a role of appetite-regulating hormones in alcohol use disorder. Reductions in acylated ghrelin levels are associated with reductions in craving and cue-induced brain activity. Ghrelin levels can be physiologically decreased by glucose intake, which therefore could be a treatment reducing craving and cue-induced brain activity in patients with alcohol use disorder, potentially mediated by acylated ghrelin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 80 males and females with alcohol use disorder participated in the randomized placebo-controlled crossover study, examining glucose intake as acute treatment to reduce craving. Changes in craving and ghrelin levels were assessed at eight time points. Of these, 43 participants attended fMRI measurements examining habituation to cue-induced brain activation over time. Craving and hormone levels over time were analyzed using linear mixed modeling, brain activation habituation over time using flexible factorial models. RESULTS: Models revealed a significant interaction effect (F(1,474.607)= 13.563, p < .001) between sex and treatment on craving, with lower craving values in males (difference in means=-.540, p = .016, 95 %CI: -.976, -.103) and higher craving in females (difference in means=.815, p = .005, 95 %CI:.243, 1.387) in the glucose compared to the placebo condition. In males, we found a significant effect of treatment (F(1,313.602)= 7.811, p = .006) and a trend, but no significant effect of acylated ghrelin (F(1,301.568)= 3.574, p = .060) on craving as well as greater habituation to cue-induced brain activation after glucose compared to placebo intake in right putamen (T(1,35)= 4.77, p = .019). Individual habituation slopes significantly predicted the difference in craving before and after the alcohol task (F(2,36)= 5.234, p = .010; B= -36.018, p = .027) in males. CONCLUSIONS: Glucose intake could be a short-term treatment for males with alcohol use disorder to reduce alcohol craving and cue-induced brain activation. Sex-specific differences should be considered to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and develop treatment options for females."

To date, however, treatment options that target negative affective states and consecutive relapse risk in AUD are insufficient. Oxytocin (OXY) might be a promising approach for addressing negative affective states and resulting motivation to use alcohol. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the acute effects of 24 I.U. OXY, administered intranasally, compared to matched placebo (PLC) on central processing of negative emotional stimuli in the amygdala in individuals with AUD. METHODS: We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in N = 24 individuals with AUD. Amygdala response to emotional stimuli served as primary outcome and was assessed using a validated functional magnetic resonance imaging emotion-processing task. Alcohol craving served as secondary outcome. RESULTS: OXY versus PLC attenuated right amygdala reactivity to fearful and angry emotional face stimuli during the fMRI task (t(33) = 3.32, pFWE=0.035), while no effect of OXY on amygdala activation was observed during the presentation of geometric figures. In addition, right amygdala reactivity to fearful and angry emotional face stimuli was positively associated with alcohol craving (r =.332, Bias corrected and accelerated 95% confidence interval [95% BCa CI]=-0.044 to 0.624, p =.042). CONCLUSIONS: OXY's effects on the neurocircuitry underlying negative affect and craving in AUD support its potential for dampening alcohol craving induced by negative affective states and implicate OXY as a potential future treatment option for AUD.

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of dietary Lf intervention on alcohol-induced liver injury (ALI) in mice. The results demonstrated that oral administration of Lf effectively ameliorated alcohol-induced lipid metabolism disorders by reducing the serum levels of TC, TG and LDL-C and increasing the serum levels of HDL-C. In addition, oral administration of Lf effectively prevented alcohol-induced liver damage by increasing the hepatic activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, GSH-Px) and alcohol-metabolizing enzymes (ADH and ALDH). Interestingly, 16S amplicon sequencing showed that oral administration of Lf increased the number of Prevotella, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Lactobacillus, but decreased the proportion of Faecalibaculum, Adlercreutzia and Alistipes in the intestines of mice that consumed excessive alcohol, which was highly associated with improved liver function. As revealed by liver untargeted metabolomics studies, oral Lf clearly changed liver metabolic profiles, with the signature biomarkers mainly involving purine metabolism, taurine metabolism, tryptophan, alanine, aspartic acid and glutamate metabolism, etc. Additionally, Lf intervention regulated liver gene transcription in over-drinking mice for cholesterol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, alcohol metabolism and oxidative stress. Taken together, the above research results provide solid scientific support for the biological activity of Lf in ameliorating alcohol-induced liver metabolism disorder and intestinal microbiota imbalance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the high burden of alcohol use and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), access to health care is poor. Digital interventions (DIs) have recently emerged as promising avenues for addressing substance use. Such interventions could potentially address barriers to help-seeking in LMICs, such as travel costs, shortage of professionals, stigma, etc. AIM: To synthesize evidence on the effectiveness and implementation of DIs for AUDs in LMICs. METHODS: The systematic review had a comprehensive search strategy that combined search terms for DIs (e.g. SMS, eHealth), alcohol use (e.g. hazardous drinking) and LMICs (e.g. India). Studies presenting primary data that reported effectiveness (e.g. relapse) and/or implementation or intervention-related outcomes (e.g. feasibility) of DIs for AUDs in LMICs were eligible. Three databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) were searched from their inception till June 2023. Data was extracted in relevant categories and analysed. RESULTS: Twenty-one reports from 19 studies were included. Types of DIs ranged from standalone mobile applications and web portals to human-delivered interventions via digital platforms. 12 studies reported positive or partially positive alcohol use outcomes (e.g. number of drinking days, abstinence). DIs with human involvement were found to be more effective than standalone DIs. Additionally, high levels of acceptability, feasibility and satisfaction were reported across interventions. CONCLUSION: DIs are acceptable and feasible in LMICs and broadly effective in improving alcohol use outcomes. Firm conclusions could not be drawn because of methodological issues such as small sample sizes, short follow-up periods and limited generalisability. Adequate investment, improved research methodology and increased focus on implementation outcomes are required for determining the role that DIs can play in addressing AUDs in LMICs."

Further, we examined whether these mindfulness profiles were indirectly associated with alcohol and cannabis-related outcomes via alcohol and cannabis use motives. METHOD: Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to determine the number of latent classes among 771 US university students (75.7% White, 66.8% female) who consumed alcohol and cannabis in the prior month. Additionally, parallel mediation analyses were conducted to determine whether mindfulness profiles were indirectly associated with alcohol- and cannabis-related outcomes via alcohol and cannabis use motives. RESULTS: LPA indicated a 4-class solution fit optimally. Further, the high mindfulness group was generally the most adaptive (lower scores) across alcohol and cannabis outcomes, whereas the judgmentally observing group was generally the most maladaptive (higher scores). Indirect effect analyses revealed that compared to the low mindfulness group, the high mindfulness group reported lower scores on alcohol- and cannabis-related outcomes via lower alcohol- and cannabis-related coping motives. CONCLUSIONS: These findings can inform prevention and intervention efforts using mindfulness techniques and interventions among students who engage in problematic alcohol and cannabis use.

RESULTS: 187 patients (median age: 53 [43-60]; male: 69%) were included. A liver biopsy was performed in 51% of cases. Patients were admitted for impaired consciousness (71%), sepsis (64%), shock (44%), respiratory failure (37%). At admission, median SOFA and MELD scores were 10 [7-13] and 31 [26-40] respectively. 63% of patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, 62% vasopressors, and 36% renal replacement therapy. 66% of patients received corticosteroids, and liver transplantation was performed in 16 patients (8.5%). ICU and in-hospital mortality were 37% and 53% respectively. By multivariate analysis, ICU mortality was associated with SOFA score (without total bilirubin) (SHR 1.08 [1.02-1.14] per one-point increase), arterial lactate (SHR 1.08 [1.03-1.13] per 1 mmol/L) and MELD score (SHR 1.09 [1.04-1.14] per 1 point), while employment was associated with increased survival (HR 0.49 [0.28-0.86]). After propensity score weighting, the use of corticosteroids did not affect ICU mortality in the overall population but had a beneficial effect in the subgroup of patients with histological proof. Patient prognosis was also better in responders assessed by Lille score at day 7 (OR 6.67 [2.44-20.15], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Alcohol related hepatitis is a severe condition leading to high mortality in ICU patients. Severity of organ failure at admission are mortality risk factors. Outcome was significantly better in responders to corticosteroids therapy according to Lille score. Early referral to tertiary centers to discuss liver transplantation should more widely be considered."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Sustained Patient-centered Alcohol-Related Care (SPARC) trial demonstrated that 6 months of practice facilitation, decision support in electronic health records (EHRs) and performance feedback, increased identification and treatment of unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) in primary care (PC). The Michigan SPARC (MI-SPARC) study tested an adaptation of SPARC for small-medium PC practices. METHODS: PC practices were recruited for and participated in alcohol-related quality improvement (2/2020-2/2023). Outcomes collected for quality improvement were used for this evaluation, with data collected manually (\"manual practices\") or electronically (\"electronic practices\"). The prevalence of EHR-documented brief intervention (BI) and AUD medication treatment (primary outcomes), and alcohol screening and AUD diagnosis (secondary outcomes) were measured at baseline and 6-months. Secondary data from formative evaluation and practice surveys were analyzed using PRISM domains: external environment, recipients, implementation infrastructure, and intervention. RESULTS: 25 practices enrolled; 14 completed data collection. Neither primary outcome was consistently monitored or collected by practices. Mean prevalence of documented screening increased from 20 % to 55 % (manual practices) and from 3 % to 20 % (electronic practices). The mean prevalences of documented AUD diagnosis at baseline and follow-up, were 1.4 % and 3.8 % (manual) and 0.1 % and 0.05 % (electronic). At follow-up, 12 practices reported screening with validated questionnaires, and 13 and 8 offering BI and AUD medications respectively. Barriers identified were low resources, small PC teams, low EHR functionality, intervention complexity, stigma, and COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Despite adaptions for smaller PC practices and improvements in screening, MI-SPARC did not increase documented BI or AUD medication treatment, largely reflecting mismatch between intervention complexity and implementation infrastructure in PC practices."

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder with serious health and social consequences. However, few licensed and successful pharmacotherapies exist for heterogeneous and complex disorders such as AUD, and these are poorly utilized. Preclinical and clinical findings suggest that the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) system, a gut-brain peptide, is involved in the neurobiology of addictive behaviors. Additionally, the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has become a promising target for the treatment of AUD. Semaglutide, a novel GLP-1R agonist, has received clinical approval to treat type 2 diabetes in both subcutaneous and oral dosage forms. Studies have shown that it significantly reduces alcohol consumption and relapse of alcohol addiction in rats, suggesting its potential effectiveness for treating alcohol abuse in humans, particularly in overweight patients with AUDs. However, the use of semaglutide is associated with potential risks, such as gallbladder disease and clinical complications associated with delayed gastric emptying. This review evaluates the safety of semaglutide to inform its wider clinical application. Further extensive and in-depth studies on semaglutide are needed to reveal additional valuable clinical benefits."

This combination is highly prevalent and associated with a multitude of diseases. Brief alcohol intervention (BAI) may be less effective among persons who drink alcohol and smoke tobacco than among persons who drink alcohol and do not smoke. The aim of this study was to find out whether BAI is more effective among adults who do not smoke than among those who smoke. METHODS: This study reports secondary outcome analyses of the randomized controlled trial \"Testing a proactive expert system intervention to prevent and to quit at-risk alcohol use\". Among municipal office clients, 1646 who were aged 18-64 and consumed alcohol in the last year participated. Using latent growth curve models the impact of BAI was compared by incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of self-reported heavy drinking days and the moderating effect of smoking was investigated. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between intervention and control in reducing heavy drinking days in persons who never smoked (IRR 1.01, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.92-1.10, P = 0.847), formerly smoked (IRR 0.91, CI 0.77-1.07, P = 0.234), currently smoked less than daily (IRR 0.98, CI 0.86-1.12, P = 0.782) and persons who currently smoked daily (IRR 1.09, CI 0.98-1.22, P = 0.125). CONCLUSION: The effect of BAI did not differ among study participants who currently smoked as among participants who did not. Although not statistically significant, persons who formerly smoked tended to benefit. Persons who currently smoked did not benefit."

Given the lack of effective pharmacological treatments, flavonoid-rich fruits have attracted growing attention as potential intervention strategies. This study investigated the independent and combined effects of extracts from Citri reticulatae pericarpium (CRPE) and Chaenomeles speciosa (Sweet) Nakai (CSPE), previously shown to possess hepatoprotective properties, in a mouse model of ethanol-induced chronic ALI. The flavonoid composition of CRPE and CSPE was characterized using LC-MS/MS, and their potential mechanisms of action were further elucidated through transcriptomic analysis. The results showed that CRPE and CSPE, whether administered individually or in combination, effectively alleviated alcohol-induced hepatic histological damage and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, both extracts significantly reduced OS and improved lipid metabolism. Notably, CRPE, CSPE, and their combination regulated the gut microbiota, as shown by increased abundances of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, along with elevated levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These findings highlight that combinations of multiple fruit extracts exhibit significant potential in alleviating ALI by modulating the gut microbiota, providing valuable insights for the development of functional foods."

Rising numbers of alcohol-related health presentations and limited resources of alcohol treatment services necessitate the implementation of both cost-effective and clinically effective interventions. APPROACH: A systematic literature search was conducted to review the economic evidence base for AWS interventions. A search of PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web-of-Science and Proquest identified 6347 articles. Following duplicate removal, 5250 English language papers were screened; 58 papers met eligibility criteria. Fifty papers were excluded at full-text screening; 8 papers were included. A novel logic model describing factors impacting clinical and cost-effectiveness of AWS management was developed. KEY FINDINGS: The United States (3), the United Kingdom (3), France (1) and Switzerland (1) based studies took primarily a health sector perspective, with most reporting on cost savings, rather than full health economic evaluations. Both patient- or symptom-specific guidelines and outpatient treatment reduce service costs in select patient populations, without impacting on treatment outcomes. Additional psychological outpatient support may also be a cost-effective addition to treatment. IMPLICATIONS: Where clinically suitable, early transition of AWS treatment to outpatient settings, alongside implementation of patient- or symptom-specific treatment guidelines, both may improve the cost-effectiveness of alcohol treatment services. Significant heterogeneity among current study methodology, patient population and poor-quality economic evidence means further studies are required. CONCLUSION: To develop a more robust understanding of cost and clinical-effectiveness, we propose a transdisciplinary research agenda between health economics, academic expertise and AWS services to address the current evidence gap in this area."

Dictyophora polysaccharides (DIPs) are essential components of the valuable edible fungus Dictyophora, which has antioxidant properties that can delay the aging process of the body. This study aimed to investigate the roles of NLRP3 in chronic EtOH-induced cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) degeneration and behavioral changes. METHODS: C57BL/6J normal and NLRP3 knockout mice were exposed to EtOH for 14 days. Dictyophora polysaccharide (DIP) and NLRP3 inhibitor were administered to the EtOH mice. The pathology and NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 signaling pathway proteins were analyzed in EtOH mice cerebellar tissues and behavioral performance was assessed in the mice. RESULTS: In the EtOH mouse model, we observed increases in the NLRP3 inflammasome proteins, including NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, mature IL-1β and pro IL-1β, loss of PCs, and motor coordination disorders. We found that DIPs could suppress the NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 signaling pathway, and alleviate the motor deficits and cerebellar pathological changes in chronic EtOH mice. Next, we used MCC950, a NLRP3 inhibitor, and an NLRP3 knockout strategy to further verify the effects of NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 signaling in chronic EtOH mice. MCC950 or NLRP3 knockout alleviated the EtOH-induced latency to decreases in fall time, increases in stride width and decreases in stride length. MCC950 or NLRP3 knockout also attenuated PC number loss and suppressed NLRP3 inflammation induced by EtOH. Taken together, pharmacologically or genetically inhibiting NLRP3 alleviated EtOH-induced cerebellar degeneration and behavioral deficits. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that DIPs might diminish EtOH-induced cerebellar degeneration and behavioral deficits through the NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 signaling pathway, which provides a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of alcoholism and EtOH-induced cerebellar pathology."

Lately, some animal studies and observational data suggested that GLP-1RA may be useful in the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). We aim to compare the risk of progression to liver cirrhosis and alcohol-related hospital admission after initiation of GLP-1RA versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), as the active comparator, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and AUD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study, utilizing new-user and active comparator design. The study used data from the Veterans Health Administration during fiscal years 2006 to 2021 encompassing adults with AUD who initiated either GLP-1RA or DPP4i prescriptions. Our two co-primary outcomes were progression to cirrhosis (compensated and decompensated cirrhosis) and alcohol-related hospital admission. RESULTS: The eligible cohort included 9965 GLP-1RA users and 19,688 DPP4i users. After propensity score matching, 7302 pairs were matched on 79 characteristics without residual imbalances. In the propensity score-matched cohort, progression to cirrhosis occurred in 6.6% of GLP-1RA users and 6.0% DPP4i users; odds ratio (OR): 1.1, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.97-1.26. Alcohol-related hospital admission occurred in 1.4% of GLP-1RA users and in 1.7% of DPP4i users (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.65-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Use of GLP-1RA in patients with AUD was not associated with beneficial effect on progression to cirrhosis or alcohol-related hospital admission."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries saw large increases in rates of alcohol-specific deaths, including England. This study aimed to examine whether there have been changes in the characteristics of those dying by specific cause of death, age, sex, and area-level deprivation. METHODS: Using annual mortality data in England published by the Office for National Statistics, we describe the prevalence and 95% CI of age-standardised rates of alcohol-specific deaths overall and by age, sex, area-level deprivation measured by quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), and cause of death between 2001 and 2022. We also compared demographic profiles of those dying before the COVID-19 pandemic (2017-19) and after (2020-22); calculated crude absolute differences in rates and relative rate ratios across age, sex, and IMD; and used a multivariable Poisson regression model to calculate the rate ratio and adjusted absolute differences for deaths by IMD quintile for each period, adjusting for age and sex. FINDINGS: Age-standardised rates of alcohol-specific deaths in England remained largely unchanged until 2019, before rising sharply by 19·4% in 2020 and continuing to rise by a further 13·5% to the highest level on record in 2022: 14·7 (95% CI 14·4-15·0) per 100 000 people. There were few relative demographic changes in alcohol-specific mortality between 2017-19 (pre-pandemic) and 2020-22 (after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic) because the largest absolute increases in alcohol-specific mortality were seen among groups that had the highest pre-pandemic rates, including men (absolute rate increase, 3·87; relative increase, 25·9%) and those from areas of higher deprivation (absolute rate increase, 4·72; relative increase, 22·5%). When examining causes of deaths, the largest absolute increase was in alcohol-related liver disease (2·37; relative increase, 27·2%), with the largest relative increase in acute causes (absolute rate increase, 0·49; relative increase, 35·4%), although these accounted for a smaller proportion of deaths compared to alcohol-related liver disease. There was little to no change in deaths from alcohol dependence syndrome (absolute rate increase, 0·02; relative increase, 5·8%). INTERPRETATION: Alcohol-specific deaths in England remain high and increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies should aim to reduce rates of alcohol consumption at the population level. Substantial investment is also required to facilitate early detection of liver disease and effective treatment. FUNDING: Cancer Research UK."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patchouli alcohol (PA), the active ingredient of Pogostemonis Herba, is important in medicine and food, effectively alleviating irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) symptoms; however, its mechanism remains unclear. Myosin Va, particularly in the intestinal longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus (LMMP), modulates neurotransmitter release, restoring gastrointestinal motility. PURPOSE: To investigate the primary targets and potential mechanisms of PA in the treatment of IBS-D. STUDY DESIGN: PA treats IBS-D may involve the regulation of neurotransmitter release through the modulation of Myosin Va, and remodels neurons of colon LMMP, ultimately restores enteric nervous system (ENS) homeostasis. METHODS: The GEO database, UK Biobank (UKB) public database and Mendelian randomization (MR) were utilized to identify differentially expressed genes and risk genes in IBS-D population. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were applied to screen for targets of PA in the treatment of IBS-D and predicted the binding affinity of drug targets. We established a chronic restraint stress-induced IBS-D rat model, after that PA (5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) was given to treat disease, and multi-omics methods such as bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing, whole transcriptome sequencing and snRNA-seq were used to observe the therapeutic effect of PA. Then measured the expression levels of LMMP neurotransmitter and Myosin Va via in vivo and in vitro experiments. Additionally, observe the effect of PA on Myosin Va-deficient DBA(Dilute, Brown and Non-Agouti) mice, and the regulation of Myosin Va expression by PA was verified by knockdown and overexpression gene function. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis, Mendelian randomization and Network pharmacology suggested that neurotransmitter are PA targets in IBS-D treatment. Molecular docking predicted a strong binding affinity between PA and these targets. Multiomics indicated aberrant gastrointestinal motility, imbalanced excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and significantly reduced myosin Va expression under chronic restraint stress-induced IBS-D rat. PA treatment significantly improved these symptoms and restored intestinal microbiota homeostasis. Ex vivo experiments, DBA mice verification and gene function experiments suggested that PA treatment of IBS-D involves regulation of neurotransmitter release by modulating myosin Va and remodeling colon LMMP neurons, restoring enteric nervous system homeostasis. CONCLUSION: Our results provide a theoretical basis for PA application in IBS-D treatment.",

Effective hospital-based strategies to promote MAUD use are not well-defined. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical pathway increases MAUD initiation. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study with consecutive adult inpatients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and withdrawal requiring treatment who were admitted to a health system comprising a mix of community and tertiary academic medical centers. The impact of voluntary use of an AUD EHR-integrated clinical pathway on MAUD initiation (main outcome) and ED return or readmission for any cause within 30 days of discharge (secondary outcomes) was evaluated. RESULTS: Among 2630 inpatient medicine encounters, the pathway was utilized in 17.8%. Pathway utilization was associated with 4.31 (confidence interval [CI]: 3.10-5.99, p < .001) increased odds of MAUD initiation as compared with encounters without pathway utilization (31% vs. 15.4%). There were no differences in rates of 30-day ED returns (odds ratio [OR]: 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35-1.62; p = .47) or 30-day readmissions (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.80-1.76; p = .40) and no differences in MAUD initiation by race or ethnicity when the pathway was utilized versus not utilized. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Utilization of an EHR-integrated clinical pathway for individuals with AUD significantly increased MAUD initiation at hospital discharge. These findings support the use of an EHR-integrated clinical pathway as an implementation tool for overcoming barriers to MAUD initiation and may be a generalizable strategy for increasing low rates of MAUD prescribing for patients with AUD."

      "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a cancer that is highly aggressive and has a challenging tumor microenvironment, which restricts the efficacy of conventional medical treatments. This investigation aims to formulate a localized anticancer hydrogel that incorporates a Paclitaxel/β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) nanocomplex composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Enhancements in drug delivery, therapeutic efficacy, adverse effects, and the mitigation of multidrug resistance are the objectives of PDAC treatment. In silico analyses were performed to examine the interaction between paclitaxel (PTX) and β-CD, which revealed favorable binding and pH-dependent release characteristics. Via FTIR and XRD analyses, the PTX/β-CD inclusion complex was verified. A hydrogel based on PVA was subsequently formed by incorporating this complex. The hydrogel's physicochemical and structural characteristics were examined using SEM, FTIR, XRD, and rheological methods.. Hydrogel's physical characteristics were evaluated through biodegradation and water absorption experiments. The cytotoxic and anti-metastatic potential of the hydrogel nanocomposite was quantified by conducting MTT assays and invasion and migration assays to assess its anticancer efficacy. The estimated adsorption energy (Eads) of PTX within β-CD to form the PTX/β-CD complex was -1.133 × 10-3 kJ/mol. In the Monte Carlo (MC) method, van der Waals forces and electrostatic interactions were considered based on group-based interactions with a cutoff radius of 12.5 Å. The interaction energy of B and PVA on PTX/β-CD was -319.150 kJ/mol. The binding energy (Ebinding = Einteraction) for B/PVA/PTX/β-CD was found to be -60.977 at pH 3.4 and -69.312 at pH 7.4. In acidic conditions, the Paclitaxel/β-CD nanocomplex exhibited efficient drug release and strong binding interactions. Biodegradation (80 % weight loss within 28 days) and water absorption (up to 500 % of its dried weight) were both exceptional characteristics of the PVA hydrogel. According to anticancer assays, the nanocomposite exhibited substantial cytotoxic effects, which included the inhibition of cancer cell migration and invasion. Paclitaxel's solubility and biological activity were significantly improved by the injectable hydrogel, which confirmed its potential as a sophisticated local drug delivery system. CONCLUSIONS: For the localized treatment of PDAC, the PVA-based injectable hydrogel that has been developed, which includes a Paclitaxel/β-CD nanocomplex, is a promising approach. Its targeted delivery, enhanced solubility, and potent anticancer characteristics offer a valuable method for enhancing therapeutic outcomes while reducing systemic side effects and multidrug resistance."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is increasing in incidence and mortality in Australia, and the proportion attributable to excess alcohol intake, overweight and obesity is rising. People with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) are at high risk, but prevention via weight loss, alcohol cessation, and routine surveillance can reduce the likelihood of HCC death. We aimed to estimate the potential for HCC prevention in Australians with ARLD and MASLD. STUDY DESIGN: Simulation modelling study. METHODS: The existing Policy1-Liver model of liver disease was extended to capture disease progression in people with ARLD and MASLD. A weight loss intervention, alcohol cessation, and routine HCC surveillance using FIB-4, transient elastography, and ultrasound were simulated, and the impacts on HCC burden and costs were estimated. RESULTS: A once-off 10% weight loss intervention would reduce risk of MASLD-related HCC death by 25.9%. Up to 417 Australian HCC deaths would be preventable annually through this intervention. Alcohol cessation could double quality-adjusted life expectancy of people with ARLD. Routine HCC surveillance would reduce ARLD-related HCC death risk by 18.6 % and MASLD-related HCC death risk by 18.1%, and prevent up to 254 MASLD- and ARLD-related HCC deaths in Australia annually. Surveillance would be cost-effective, except for those with early-stage MASLD. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss, alcohol cessation, and routine HCC surveillance can improve health outcomes for people with ARLD or MASLD. Modelling to support cost-effective prevention can help guide policy decisions and future investment in liver cancer control in Australia."

The experimental results indicate that within a glucose concentration of 2 mM to 10 mM and an insulin concentration of 0.1 mM to 1 mM, the measured current exhibits a linear relationship with the concentration of glucose or insulin, regardless of whether cyclic voltammetry or linear sweep voltammetry is used. However, the detection limit for insulin is 0.01 mM, ensuring that glucose detection remains unaffected by insulin interference. In this sensor, nickel-cobalt serves as a catalyst for glucose and insulin detection, while the graphene oxide-polyvinyl alcohol composite enhances sensing performance.",

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of alcohol-assisted delamination (ALD) of the corneal epithelium in patients with EBMD affecting the visual axis, who experience decreased vision quality due to higher-order aberrations (HOAs) and irregular astigmatism. Methods: Eleven eyes of nine patients (four males and five females) were treated with ALD, with a mean age of 51.3 ± 19.7 years. All patients underwent refraction, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) assessment, a comprehensive slit-lamp examination for EBMD pattern identification, anterior segment imaging with and without fluorescein, tear break-up time (BUT) testing, corneal topography, corneal aberrometry (Zernike coefficients (Znm) were calculated for a 5.0 mm simulated pupil), and anterior segment optical coherence tomography preoperatively and at 1-day, 14-day, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month intervals. Results: All patients demonstrated improvements in BCVA and visual quality, ocular comfort, and BUT results. The mean root mean square (RMS) value of total corneal aberrations decreased from 1.72 ± 0.90 μm to 0.90 ± 0.62 μm, while the mean RMS value of HOAs reduced from 0.92 ± 0.48 μm to 0.53 ± 0.28 μm. Astigmatism and trefoil were the aberration components that exhibited the most significant reductions. Conclusions: Alcohol-assisted delamination of the corneal epithelium is a safe and effective treatment for central EBMD patients experiencing visual quality deterioration. Astigmatism and trefoil appear to be the primary aberrations contributing to visual disturbances in this patient population."

In this study, we examine how the dosage of specific intervention components of the Sacramento Neighborhood Alcohol Prevention Project (SNAPP) may differentially affect child abuse outcomes. SNAPP used a quasi-experimental phased intervention design to reduce alcohol-related problems among 15-29-year-olds in two economically, racially, and ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Sacramento, California. Study activities were conducted from 1999 through 2003. The intervention occurred in 37 Census block groups (21 block groups in the South and 16 in the North) compared to 289 block groups in the At-Large comparison area. Our child abuse outcomes include substantiations of child abuse and neglect and total and alcohol-related foster care entries. Data on child abuse outcomes were obtained from the Sacramento County Department of Children and Family Services and analyzed using conditionally autoregressive spatio-temporal Bayesian analyses. Enforcement of intoxicated patron and on-premise alcohol outlet compliance checks were related to large reductions in all three outcomes in the North intervention area, 33.4% for substantiations, 44.8% for total foster care entries, and 68.4% for alcohol-related foster care entries. However, these activities were not implemented in the South area. Community awareness activities appear to increase total and alcohol-related foster care entries in the South, but reduce substantiations and total foster care entries in the North. Compliance of on-premise outlets may be an effective intervention component to reduce child abuse and neglect; however, these results need replication. Further, despite the dosage of intervention components that reduced substantiations, the overall effect of the SNAPP intervention did not reduce this outcome."

METHODS: Adult patients with AUD (N = 1101) completed the DSM-5 AUD symptom checklist as part of routine clinical assessment upon admission to an inpatient substance use disorder treatment program. We conducted Rasch analysis of responses to the 11 criteria, examining model fit and item severities. We also examined whether there was evidence of differential item functioning based on sex and age. RESULTS: Results supported the unidimensionality and local independence of the criteria, although some items were a suboptimal fit to the Rasch model. In particular, across all indicators, hazardous use exhibited misfit with model expectations. Additionally, the range of item severities did not span the full range of problem severity within this clinical sample, with many patients at the high end of the severity continuum and no items to differentiate them. There was evidence of differential item functioning by both sex and age, but effect size indices suggested that differences were unlikely to be clinically meaningful. CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the unidimensionality of the DSM-5 AUD diagnosis, but the misfit of certain items to the Rasch model and the narrow range of item severities suggest that more granular distinctions in AUD may be limited in high-severity samples. The results also suggest that the assumptions of interval-level measurement may not hold in clinical populations."

But the poor water resistance significantly limits the application scenarios for paper-based packaging. This study was designed to improve the hydrophobic properties of paper-based antimicrobial indicator cards by surface coating with methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). The results indicated that all treated antimicrobial indicator cards changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, with the MTS/OTS (1:1) treated antimicrobial indicator cards (M/OTS@Paper) showing the highest hydrophobicity (119.38°) and strong hydrophobic stability. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis indicated that the increase in hydrophobicity was attributable to the decrease in hydrogen bonding within the hydroxyl groups. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results substantiated that the hydroxyl groups present in the paper and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) reacted with the hydrophobicizing agent, which was consistent with the phenomenon observed in scanning electron microscope (SEM). The hydrophobically treated antimicrobial indicator cards showed varying degrees of mechanical degradation due to hydrogen bond disruption. Antimicrobial indicator cards still retain excellent antimicrobial activity, pH response, and ammonia sensitivity after hydrophobic treatment. When using the antimicrobial indicator cards to monitor carp freshness, the cards' color changed significantly from purple-red to purple-black, and the fish's shelf life was extended by 2 days compared to the control group without antimicrobial indicator card. According to the comprehensive evaluation, M/OTS@Paper has the best hydrophobicity and has good application prospects in freshness indication packaging."

      "abstract": "Childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a known risk factor for later alcohol-related outcomes, such as drinking at young ages or developing alcohol use disorder by adulthood. However, research has yet to determine whether common ADHD-related impairments (e.g., lower educational attainment) in early adulthood play a role in this outcome above and beyond ADHD symptom persistence. Individuals with (n = 316) and without (n = 223) ADHD in childhood participated in a longitudinal study (Mage = 29). Childhood diagnoses were based on comprehensive, standardized assessments, and follow-up data were self-report and parent report. Mediating pathways through key impairments and ADHD symptom persistence in early adulthood were simultaneously tested, from childhood ADHD (absent/present) to later adulthood (Mage = 29) alcohol outcomes (alcohol-related problems and heavy drinking frequency), using Mplus 8.2. Support was found for the mediating roles of greater social impairment, lower educational attainment, and ADHD symptom persistence in the association between childhood ADHD and alcohol-related problems. Mediation by early adulthood delinquency for alcohol problems was not supported. No mediating pathways to heavy drinking frequency were supported. These findings illustrate the importance of social and academic functioning, in addition to ADHD symptom persistence, in risk for alcohol-related problems as individuals with a history of ADHD in childhood enter a phase of life requiring substantial adulthood responsibility. These results suggest the critical importance of focusing prevention and treatment efforts on major domains of functioning in addition to ADHD symptom reduction for prevention and treatment of harmful alcohol use.

      "abstract": "Affecting nearly 10% of men globally, alcohol use disorders (AUDs) represent a significant public health burden. Existing work, including from Ukraine, suggests that living in conflict settings may exacerbate the risk of AUDs. However, there is a dearth of evidence regarding alcohol misuse, as well as knowledge of factors associated with alcohol misuse patterns, in conflict settings. The aim of this qualitative study was to investigate explanatory models of alcohol misuse among conflict-affected men in Ukraine. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit 66 conflict-affected men with alcohol misuse, family members of men who misuse alcohol, community health workers, and mental health and psychosocial support providers from locations across Ukraine. In the group of men who misuse alcohol (n=25), we recruited individuals with diverse experiences of adversity: 1) internally displaced persons from eastern Ukraine and Crimea displaced after 2014; 2) Ukrainian military veterans or territorial defense volunteers from various regions; and 3) men living 5-15 kilometers from the frontline. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Ukrainian or Russian, and analysed using deductive and inductive analysis. Qualitative data received from each subgroup were analysed separately. The resulting explanatory model represents how Ukrainian conflict-affected men describe causes of alcohol misuse. Participants identified that alcohol misuse among Ukrainian men is often used as \"self-treatment\" to address mental health symptoms and feelings of demoralization that are exacerbated by a lack of supportive social environments and socio-economic problems; these behaviours also occur in an environment that deems alcohol misuse to be culturally appropriate. Family members and service providers offered a similar understanding of alcohol misuse as the men themselves. Strategies suggested by conflict-affected men to protect against alcohol misuse included engaging in alternative activities, finding supportive social environments, fear of negative consequences from alcohol misuse and increasing self-awareness and self-control. These findings indicate possible implications for interventions that target alcohol misuse among conflict-affected men, as well as demonstrate a need for developing culturally sensitive interventions that can address this unaddressed public health need."

We found that only approximately half (51%) provide MOUD and fewer (45%) provide MAUD. State licensure/certification was negatively associated with providing these medications, while national organization accreditation was positively associated. However, states varied widely in these associations. Additionally, SUD programs were less likely to offer MOUD/MAUD compared with MH/SUD programs.

The function of AD-associated FYN variants remains largely unknown due to the absence of an appropriate model for studying them. Here, we generated human embryonic stem cell lines homozygous/heterozygous for rs706895 C/T alleles in 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of FYN by CRISPR-Cas9 editing to explore the AD association. Transcriptome and reporter gene analyses demonstrated that induced neurons with the rs706895 C allele showed a significantly higher expression level of FYN under ethanol treatment. Our results suggest that FYN 5' UTR variant rs706895 may influence an individual's vulnerability to AD by altering FYN expression. Targeting AD-associated variants may provide a better understanding of disease mechanisms and a reliable basis for the personalized AD treatment."

MEASUREMENTS: Mixed effects logistic regression models tested associations between alcohol exposures [ethyl-glucuronide (EtG)-positive urine screens, past-week binge drinking and past-week binge drinking frequency] and same-week use of other substances (positive urine screens for cannabis, cocaine or amphetamines), adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, income, depression score and treatment assignment. Associations by treatment assignment (naltrexone or placebo) were also evaluated. FINDINGS: Having a positive EtG urine screen was associated with higher odds of positive urine screens for cannabis [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.93, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.37-6.30, P = 0.006) or cocaine (aOR = 3.08, 95% CI = 1.52-6.23, P = 0.002). Each additional binge drinking day was associated with higher odds of having a positive urine screen for cocaine (aOR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.04-1.60, P = 0.018). Among those receiving naltrexone, greater binge drinking days was associated with increased odds of having a positive urine screen for cocaine (aOR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.18-2.27, P = 0.003), while results for cannabis and amphetamines were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Among adult sexual and gender minority men enrolled in a clinical trial, alcohol use was positively associated with cannabis and cocaine use. Naltrexone may mitigate cocaine use in this group by moderating binge drinking or diminishing the rewarding effects of cocaethylene. Findings highlight the potential of targeted naltrexone as an intervention to address alcohol and cocaine co-use and improve treatment outcomes in this underserved group."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Efficacy of brief alcohol interventions for young adults with internalizing distress (i.e. symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress) is unclear. We tested the moderating effect of internalizing distress on the efficacy of alcohol single- and multicomponent personalized feedback interventions (PFIs). DESIGN: Secondary data were analyzed from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of single and multicomponent PFIs, compared with an attention-only control condition. SETTING: Participants were sampled from two West Coast universities in the United States. All study protocols were completed online. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 1137) were college students (63% female; Mage = 20.1 years; 62.6% non-Hispanic white) who reported on internalizing distress at baseline. Some individuals reported clinically significant symptoms (depression: mild/moderate = 24.0%, severe/extremely severe = 10.5%; anxiety: mild/moderate = 19.6%, severe/extremely severe = 11.4%; and stress: mild/moderate = 37.5%, severe/extremely severe = 6.0%). INTERVENTIONS: There were four different alcohol single-component PFIs administered and an attention-only PFI control. Alcohol PFIs varied in their complexity and single-component PFIs (i.e. personalized normative feedback) were compared with multicomponent PFI (i.e. containing additional alcohol-focused psychoeducation). MEASUREMENTS: Baseline levels of internalizing distress were measured using the summed total of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS). Drinking outcomes (alcohol consumption, peak eBAC, alcohol-related consequences) were measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. FINDINGS: Alcohol PFI (compared with attention-only control) reduced alcohol consumption and related consequences at 6-month [rate ratio (RR)Consumption = 0.85, P = 0.004] or 12-month follow-ups (RRConsumption = 0.76, P < 0.001; RRConsequences = 0.85, P = 0.020), regardless of baseline DASS score. Participants with higher DASS scores (compared with those with lower DASS scores) reported lower 6-month alcohol consumption after receiving a single-component intervention (RR = 0.80, P < 0.001). However, individuals with higher DASS scores (compared to those with lower DASS scores) reported more 6-month alcohol-related consequences after receiving a multicomponent intervention (RR = 0.78, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized feedback interventions may demonstrate efficacy towards reducing drinking in young adults and appear similarly beneficial across levels of internalizing distress, although lower-complexity interventions may be more efficacious."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dopamine is involved in reward processing and plays a critical role in the development and progression of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, little is known about the effect of sex on the relationship between dopamine and alcohol use/AUD. There is a critical need to identify the neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to sex differences in AUD to inform treatment approaches. This study aimed to review existing literature on sex differences in the effects of alcohol on brain dopamine measures in animals and individuals with heavy drinking/AUD. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed was searched from inception to July 23rd, 2024. RESULTS: Of the 1,412 articles identified, 10 met study criteria (1 human, 9 animal), including in vivo (two positron emission tomography, four microdialysis) and ex vivo (two liquid chromatography, two fast-scan cyclic voltammetry) studies. Six studies included an alcohol challenge; three showed that females had greater alcohol-induced dopamine release than males in the ventral striatum and frontal cortex, while three showed no sex-related differences. Notably, the latter three studies examined sex in a combined AUD/control group or measured dopamine levels days after alcohol exposure. Two studies that examined the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure showed that prenatal-alcohol-exposed male offspring versus sex-matched air-exposed controls had greater prefrontal cortical dopamine D1 receptor availability, and prenatal-alcohol-exposed female offspring versus sex-matched air-exposed controls had greater striatal dopamine concentration. Two studies investigating the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) regulation of alcohol-induced dopamine release showed a faster decline in females relative to males while the other study found females may be less dependent on MOR activity at lower doses of alcohol relative to higher doses. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed mixed results regarding sex differences in brain dopamine measures in alcohol-exposed animals and individuals with AUD, which may arise from differences in the timing, quantity, and duration of alcohol exposure, species, conditions, models, and techniques. More research examining the effect of sex on the relationship between alcohol use and brain dopamine measures is needed to enhance our understanding of AUD development, progression, and treatment in both females and males.",

METHOD: A quasi-experimental study with 2031 students (53.1% from 3rd ESO and 46.9% from 4th ESO), divided into an intervention group (IG) and a comparison group (CG). Data collected in October 2020 and April 2021 were analyzed using t-tests and logistic regression adjusted by inverse probability weighting and educational centers. RESULTS: In April, in 3rd ESO, the IG showed a lower probability of lifetime alcohol (OR: 0.62) and cannabis use (OR: 0.34) compared to the CG, as well as a 15.1% higher prevalence of resistance to peer pressure to consume cannabis. In October, in 4th ESO, the moderately positive impact persisted, but by April, it had disappeared, with no clear effect on students who participated in the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The ARGOS Community-Educational Program had a limited impact on alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use, resistance to peer pressure, and increased risk perception, particularly in 3rd ESO and the early stages of 4th ESO. Reinforcing the program with preventive interventions to consolidate and enhance its impact is deemed necessary."

METHOD: A cohort of 87,172 patients treated for an alcohol use problem within state treatment centers was examined. We extracted the first OUD/OD diagnosis event within 1 year, between 1-4 years, and more than four years of the patient's first OASAS admission. We calculated odds ratios for all predictors and control variables with respect to OUD/OD events and compared the predictive values of these variables for the different periods. RESULTS: Both sociodemographic and clinical factors were predictive of an OUD/OD overall and in most specific follow-up periods. Sociodemographic factors were more strongly associated with OUD/OD during follow-ups beyond 4 years, perhaps due to the increasing availability of opioids over time. Mental health and alcohol use severity factors were more strongly associated with OUD in the 1 year and 1-4 year periods, suggesting a rapid progression to OUD/OD. CONCLUSIONS: Both sociodemographic and clinical factors were predictive of a diagnosis of OUD/OD within a brief period of time, however they were only predictive of approximately 40% of those who would develop OUD/OD within any specific time period. These findings highlight the need for a more formal assessment of opioid use at treatment entry, and for the implementation of harm reduction measures throughout treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol use behaviors (AUBs) manifest in a variety of normative and problematic ways across the life course, all of which are heritable. Twin studies show that genetic influences on AUBs change across development, but this is usually not considered in research identifying and investigating the genes linked to AUBs. AIMS: Understanding the dynamics of how genes shape AUBs could point to critical periods in which interventions may be most effective and provide insight into the mechanisms behind AUB-related genes. In this project, we investigate how genetic associations with AUBs unfold across development using longitudinal modelling of polygenic scores (PGSs). DESIGN: Using results from genome-wide association studies (GWASs), we created PGSs to index individual-level genetic risk for multiple AUB-related dimensions: Consumption, Problems, a variable pattern of drinking associated with a preference for beer (BeerPref), and externalizing behavior (EXT). We created latent growth curve models and tested PGSs as predictors of latent growth factors (intercept, slope, quadratic) underlying trajectories of AUBs. SETTING: PGSs were derived in six longitudinal epidemiological cohorts from the US, UK, and Finland. PARTICIPANTS: Participant data were obtained from AddHealth, ALSPAC, COGA, FinnTwin12, the older Finnish Twin Cohort, and Spit for Science (total N = 19,194). These cohorts included individuals aged 14 to 67, with repeated measures collected over a span of 4 to 36 years. MEASUREMENTS: Primary measures included monthly frequency of typical alcohol consumption (CON) and heavy episodic drinking (HED). FINDINGS: Results indicated that higher PGSs for all AUBs are robustly associated with higher mean levels of CON and/or HED (B = 0.064-0.333, p < 3.09E-04). However, these same genetic indices were largely not associated with drinking trajectories across cohorts. In the meta-analysis, only PGSs for chronic alcohol Problems consistently predicted a steeper slope (increasing trajectory) of CON across time (B = 0.470, p = 4.20E-06). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that genetic associations with AUBs not only differ between behaviors, but also across developmental time points and across cohorts. Genetic studies that take such heterogeneity into account are needed to better represent the underlying etiology of AUBs. Individual-level genetic profiles may be useful to point to personalized intervention timelines, particularly for individuals with high alcohol Problems genetic risk scores."

      "abstract": "As people age, Alzheimer's disease, a neurological disorder that develops gradually, affects their memory and cognitive abilities. The two hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are intracellular buildup of neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular β-amyloid plaques. In this work, the effects of Perillyl alcohol on experimental sporadic Alzheimer-type dementia produced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin were investigated. Rats that received streptozotocin infusion experienced cholinergic hypofunction, increased oxidative-nitritive stress, and impaired memory and learning. Between 15 and 27 days following the initial streptozotocin infusion, 13 days of treatment with Perillyl alcohol (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg p.o.) significantly improved learning and memory in Morris water maze and object recognition test paradigms. Perillyl also significantly reduced oxidative-nitritive stress, as seen by a decrease in malondialdehyde and nitrite, and restored reduced glutathione and catalase levels. Acetylcholinesterase activity significantly increased in the current model, indicating cholinergic hypofunction and enhanced neuronal cell damage. Treatment with Perillyl alcohol also significantly decreased the increase in acetylcholinesterase activity, indicating that Perillyl alcohol may be able to prevent neuronal damage and restore cholinergic functions. Perillyl alcohol has been shown to improve spatial memory processing, which may be due to its antioxidant properties and capacity to restore cholinergic functioning. However, more study is required to understand the molecular mechanisms of POH that enhance cognition or prevent neurotoxic damage, which could support its application in neuroprotective effect.",
