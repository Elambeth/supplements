      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Capsinoids are potential antioxidant agents capable of reducing oxidative damage and the resulting complications triggered by obesity. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of capsinoids on adiposity and biomarkers of cardiac oxidative stress in obese rats induced by a high-fat diet. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were exposed to a high-fat diet for 27 consecutive weeks. After the characterization of obesity (week 19), some of the obese animals began to receive capsinoids (10 mg/kg/day) by orogastric gavage. Adiposity and comorbidities were assessed. In the heart, remodeling, injury, and biomarkers of oxidative stress were determined. RESULTS: The treatment did not reduce obesity-induced adiposity but was efficient in reducing cholesterol levels. Capsinoid treatment did not cause a difference in heart and LV mass, despite having reduced troponin I concentrations. Furthermore, capsinoids did not reduce the increase in the advanced oxidation of protein products and carbonylated proteins caused by obesity in cardiac tissue. In addition, obese rats treated with capsinoids presented high levels of malondialdehyde and greater antioxidant enzyme activity compared to untreated obese rats. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, treatment with capsinoids increases antioxidative enzyme activity and prevents obesity-induced cardiac injury without positively modulating body fat accumulation and cardiac oxidative biomarkers.",

We carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effect of Capsaicinoids/Capsinoids on thermogenesis indices including resting metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) in healthy adults. An electronic literature search was conducted between 1990 and 2019, using the following databases: PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE. Placebo-controlled clinical trials were considered as eligible papers. Effect sizes were pooled using weighted mean difference (WMD), with a random-effects model. Of the 4,092 articles, 13 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled effect sizes revealed that compared with placebo, Capsaicinoids/Capsinoids significantly increased RMR (WMD: 33.99 Kcal/day, 95% CI: 15.95, 52.03; I2 : 0%, p = .94), energy expenditure, and fat oxidation. It also significantly lessened RQ (WMD: -0.01, 95% CI: -0.02, -0.01; I2 : 5.4%, p = .39) and carbohydrate oxidation. Moreover, intervention in capsule form for longer duration had a more considerable influence on RMR than comparative groups. We observed moderate improvement in RMR, RQ, and fat oxidation following supplementation with Capsaicinoids/Capsinoids. However, further high-quality studies are required to clarify the thermogenic properties of Capsaicinoids/Capsinoids.",

      "abstract": "Capsaicinoids are acid amides of C9-C11 branched-chain fatty acids and vanillylamine and constitute important chemical compounds of Capsicum annuum together with their non-pungent analogs (capsinoids) which have an impressive list of health benefit properties (i.e., analgesia, anti-obesity, thermogenic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, antioxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-virulence, anti-inflamatory, anti-diabetic, inhibits angiogenesis, and improves glucose metabolism) . In this review, the state of art on how capsaicinoids are affected by different pre- and postharvest factors is discussed together with their biological activity. For instance, high light intensity and heat treatments may reduce capsaicinoid content in fruits probably due to the loss of activity of capsaicin synthase (CS) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). The pungency in peppers varies also with environment, genotype or cultivar, node position, fruiting and maturity stages, nitrogen and potassium contents. As the fruit mature, capsaicinoid levels increase. Fruits from the second node tend to have higher accumulation of pungency than those of other positions and the pungency decreases linearly as the node position increase. Sodium hydroxide treatment reduces the pungency of pepper fruit as it hydrolyzes and modifies one of the features (vanillyl group, the acid-amide linkage and alkyl side chain) of capsaicin molecule. Salt and water stress increase PAL and capsaicin synthase activity and increase the capsaicinoid accumulation in fruit, by negatively regulating peroxidase activity at appropriate levels. Future research must be directed in better understanding the changes of capsinoids during pre and post-harvest management, the causal drivers of the loss of activity of the aminotransferase gene (pAMT) and if possible, studies with genetically modified sweet peppers with functional pAMT. Available data provided in this review can be used in different agricultural programs related to developing new cultivars with specific pungency levels. The contents of capsaicinoids and capsinoids in both fresh fruits and marketed products are also of remarkable importance considering the preferences of certain niches in market where higher added-value products might be commercialized.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Capsinoids are reported to increase energy expenditure (EE) via brown adipose tissue (BAT) stimulation. However, imaging of BAT activation by capsinoids remains limited. Because BAT activation is a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity and related metabolic disorders, we sought to prove that capsinoid-induced BAT activation can be visualized by 18-fluorine fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). OBJECTIVE: We compared capsinoids and cold exposure on BAT activation and whole-body EE. DESIGN: Twenty healthy participants (8 men, 12 women) with a mean age of 26 y (range: 21-35 y) and a body mass index (kg/m2) of 21.7 (range: 18.5-26.0) underwent 18F-FDG PET and whole-body calorimetry after ingestion of 12 mg capsinoids or ≤2 h of cold exposure (∼14.5°C) in a crossover design. Mean standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the region of interest and BAT volumes were calculated. Blood metabolites were measured before and 2 h after each treatment. RESULTS: All of the participants showed negligible 18F-FDG uptake post-capsinoid ingestion. Upon cold exposure, 12 participants showed avid 18F-FDG uptake into supraclavicular and lateral neck adipose tissues (BAT-positive group), whereas the remaining 8 participants (BAT-negative group) showed undetectable uptake. Capsinoids and cold exposure increased EE, although cold induced a 2-fold increase in whole-body EE and higher fat oxidation, insulin sensitivity, and HDL cholesterol compared with capsinoids. CONCLUSIONS: Capsinoids only increased EE in BAT-positive participants, which suggests that BAT mediates EE evoked by capsinoids. This implies that capsinoids stimulate BAT to a lesser degree than cold exposure as evidenced by 18F-FDG uptake below the presently accepted SUV thresholds defining BAT activation. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02964442.",

      "abstract": "18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (FDGPET/CT) is widely used as a standard method for evaluating human brown adipose tissue (BAT), a recognized therapeutic target of obesity. However, a longitudinal BAT study using FDG-PET/CT is lacking owing to limitations of the method. Near-infrared time-resolved spectroscopy (NIR(TRS)) is a technique for evaluating human BAT density noninvasively. This study aimed to test whether NIRTRS could detect changes in BAT density during or after long-term intervention. First, using FDG-PET/CT, we confirmed a significant increase (+48.8%, P < 0.05) in BAT activity in the supraclavicular region after 6-week treatment with thermogenic capsaicin analogs, capsinoids. Next, 20 volunteers were administered either capsinoids or placebo daily for 8 weeks in a double-blind design, and BAT density was measured using NIR(TRS) every 2 weeks during the 8-week treatment period and an 8-week period after stopping treatment. Consistent with FDG-PET/CT results, NIR(TRS) successfully detected an increase in BAT density during the 8-week treatment (+46.4%, P < 0.05), and a decrease in the 8-week follow-up period (-12.5%, P = 0.07), only in the capsinoid-treated, but not the placebo, group. Thus, NIR(TRS) can be applied for quantitative assessment of BAT in longitudinal intervention studies in humans.",

      "abstract": "Beige adipocytes emerge postnatally within the white adipose tissue in response to certain environmental cues, such as chronic cold exposure. Because of its highly recruitable nature and relevance to adult humans, beige adipocytes have gained much attention as an attractive cellular target for antiobesity therapy. However, molecular circuits that preferentially promote beige adipocyte biogenesis remain poorly understood. We report that a combination of mild cold exposure at 17°C and capsinoids, a nonpungent analog of capsaicin, synergistically and preferentially promotes beige adipocyte biogenesis and ameliorates diet-induced obesity. Gain- and loss-of-function studies show that the combination of capsinoids and cold exposure synergistically promotes beige adipocyte development through the β2-adrenoceptor signaling pathway. This synergistic effect on beige adipocyte biogenesis occurs through an increased half-life of PRDM16, a dominant transcriptional regulator of brown/beige adipocyte development. We document a previously unappreciated molecular circuit that controls beige adipocyte biogenesis and suggest a plausible approach to increase whole-body energy expenditure by combining dietary components and environmental cues.",

CH-19 Sweet extract was administered once by gavage to SPF (Crl:CD(SD)) Sprague-Dawley male and female rats at dose levels of 0 (vehicle), 5, 10, or 20 ml/kg of body weight (BW). The concentration of capsinoids in the CH-19 Sweet extract was 71.25 mg/ml; this resulted in administered dose levels of capsinoids of 356.25, 712.5, and 1425 mg/kg BW, respectively. The toxicity of CH-19 Sweet extract by single oral administration was low; only transient salivation or decreased spontaneous movement was observed on the day of administration at > or =10 ml/kg BW. It was concluded that the lethal dose of CH-19 Sweet extract was estimated to be higher than 20 ml/kg (1425 mg/kg as capsinoids) for both males and females since no deaths were observed at any dose in this study. A bacterial reverse mutation test of CH-19 Sweet extract was performed employing Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli and using the preincubation method. Treatment with CH-19 Sweet extract did not increase the number of revertant colonies compared with negative controls either in the presence (+S9) or absence (-S9) of metabolic activation. An in vitro chromosome aberration test was conducted using Chinese hamster lung cultured cells (CHL/IU). Treatment with CH-19 Sweet extract failed to induce chromosome aberrations in either short-term or continuous treatment scenarios, with or without metabolic activation (-S9, +S9). In an in vivo micronucleus test using BDF(1) male mice, CH-19 Sweet extract failed to increase the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) or decrease the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) in any of the treatment groups.
