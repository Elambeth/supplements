      "abstract": "Imbalance of cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) level was observed in several infectious diseases and high plasma cortisol levels were also found in human visceral leishmaniasis. However, the mechanism remains ambiguous. In L. donovani-infected BALB/c mice, we observe increased cortisol versus decreased DHEA levels coincide with high organ parasite burden and anti-inflammatory cytokines along with increased 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βHSD1) expression. DHEA treatment in J774 and THP-1-derived macrophages restrains L. donovani-induced cortisol levels by inhibiting 11βHSD1 expression that increases pro-inflammatory and decreases anti-inflammatory mediators, thereby lowering intracellular parasitemia. In infected THP-1-derived macrophages, DHEA reciprocally regulates glucocorticoid receptors (GR) - GRα and GRβexpression, increasing GRα/GRβ heterodimers, which antagonize GRα homodimer binding on IL-10, DUSP-1 and IκBα promoters. Finally, L. donovani induces PPAR-γ binding on 11βHSD1 promoter by lipophosphoglycan, which drives cortisol production. Collectively, our observations identify DHEA as a potent immunomodulator which inhibits cortisol-mediated immunosuppression and GRβ induction to counteract GRα-anti-inflammatory signalling."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function in postmenopausal women (PMW) suffering from vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). STUDY DESIGN: This prospective observational pilot study included 34 PMW with VVA and moderate SUI. Eligibility criteria included no hormonal therapy nor infections. Participants received 6.5 mg/day vaginal DHEA for 12 weeks, and SUI symptoms and PFM function were assessed before and after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was SUI improvement, which was measured using a 3-day bladder diary and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF). Secondary outcomes included the assessment of PFM function, which was evaluated using the Modified Oxford Scale (MOS). RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, there was a statistically significant reduction in SUI episodes (p < 0.001). The median ICIQ-UI SF score decreased from 12 to 9 (p < 0.001), indicating a significant reduction in urinary symptoms. Additionally, there was a significant improvement in PFM tone, as reflected in higher MOS scores (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Vaginal DHEA treatment has been shown to significantly alleviate urinary symptoms, enhance quality of life, and strengthen PFM function in PMW with SUI and VVA. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and to explore the potential of androgen therapy in the treatment of SUI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As cocaine dependence becomes highly prevalent among a diverse population, there is a need for innovative treatments that target both the physiological and behavioral aspects of addiction. We have previously published that Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a neurosteroid, reduces cocaine-seeking behavior and relapse for cocaine use. As drug addiction manifestation is affected by upregulation of β-endorphin levels in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), which is vital for the brain's reward system and to the rewarding properties of drugs, the current study aims to determine the effects of DHEA on β-endorphin levels in the NAc and its implications for cocaine addiction treatment. METHODS: Utilizing Male Sprague-Dawley rats, DHEA was administered acutely (30 nM and 300 nM) directly into the NAc or as a chronic (14-day) intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment, and β-endorphin levels were evaluated using microdialysis. RESULTS: Our results revealed that acute DHEA administration significantly increased β-endorphin levels in the NAc, similar to the response elicited by cocaine. Conversely, chronic DHEA treatment prevents cocaine-induced β-endorphin upregulation in the NAc. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal the dual mechanisms by which DHEA alters β-endorphin levels, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent to decrease the rewarding effects of cocaine, by maintaining β-endorphin stability in the NAc. This novel insight may explain the mechanism by which DHEA reduces drug-seeking behavior, suggesting that DHEA may be a viable candidate for the treatment of cocaine addiction.",

Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Chemical Pathology, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from July 2022 to August 2023. METHODOLOGY: About 110 infertile females with infertility were enrolled in this study. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH), and Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate (DHEA-S) were measured at 3rd menstruation day. Females with primary ovarian insufficiency, using androgen supplementation, and on hormonal therapy were excluded. RESULTS: Among the participants, 63.6% had primary infertility and 36.4% had secondary infertility. Both primary and secondary infertility had a positive correlation with serum AMH and DHEA-S levels (r = 0.685; p <0.001) and (r = 0.807; p <0.001), respectively. After ultrasound, 54 (49.1%) females were normal, 12 (10.9%) had PCOS, 12 (10.9%) had fibroids, 8 (7.3%) had fallopian tube defects, 10 (9.1%) had endometriosis, and 14 (12.7%) had low antral follicular count. The correlation between serum AMH and DHEA-S with different subgroups is as follows: Normal females (r = 0.731; p <0.001), PCOs (r = -0.232; p = 0.468), fibroids (r = 0.941, p <0.001), fallopian tube defects (r =-0.800; p = 0.017), endometriosis (r = -0.684, p = 0.013), and low antral follicular count (r = 0.643, p = 0.0130).

Endogenous cortisol might influence who will benefit from exposure therapy in anxiety-spectrum disorders. METHODS: To investigate the impact of cortisol levels on within-session habituation of distress - a measure of success of exposure therapy - in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) fifty-one OCD patients were studied during their stressful first cognitive-behavioral exposure therapy session with response prevention. Subjective units of distress, salivary cortisol, and salivary dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were measured repeatedly before and during this afternoon session. RESULTS: No significant association of within-session habituation of distress and cortisol level during exposure was found. Calculating with the cortisol/DHEA ratio, similar results emerged. CONCLUSION: Studies using endogenous diurnal fluctuation of cortisol and studies with administration of exogenous cortisol are needed to test whether glucocorticoids can augment exposure session outcome."

This study investigates the potential of the endogenous neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate ester (DHEAS) as neuroprotective agents, building on evidence of their mechanisms in adult brain injury models. The primary objective was to evaluate their neuroprotective and anti-oxidative properties in a mouse model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Using the modified Rice-Vannucci model, brain injury was induced in 7-day-old mouse pups, followed by treatment with various concentrations of DHEA and DHEAS (0.1, 1, and 10 µg/g body weight) via intraperitoneal injection after a 2 h recovery period. Mice were sacrificed after 24 hours for analysis of somatometry, brain injury, apoptosis, microglial activation, and oxidative stress markers (NOX2, 4-HNE, 8-OHdG), along with the anti-oxidant marker SOD1. While no statistically significant effects of DHEA or DHEAS were observed at the tested doses and time points, the absence of toxic or adverse effects highlights their safety profile. These findings provide a foundation for further research into optimizing dosing strategies, timing, and delivery methods. Future studies should refine these variables to maximize neuroprotective efficacy, investigate DHEA(S)' exact mechanisms of action, and explore their potential for clinical application in neonatal care."

      "abstract": "The ovary is an important organ for women to maintain reproductive and endocrine functions. Ovarian aging can lead to female reproductive aging, which is a key factor causing rapid aging of the female body. Umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) play a therapeutic role in various degenerative diseases. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is widely used in the treatment of reversing oocyte quality. However, it is unclear whether UC-MSCs combined with DHEA supplementation can improve ovarian senescence in naturally aging mice. To address this question, we studied the influence of the combination of human UC-MSCs (hUC-MSCs) and DHEA on ovarian morphology and function in naturally aging mice. The results showed a significant augmentation in the number of primary follicles, as well as a significant upregulation of estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) hormone levels, and a significant increase in survival rate in naturally aging mice treated by hUC-MSCs and DHEA. Moreover, the combination of hUC-MSCs and DHEA significantly reduced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and downregulated the expression levels of proinflammatory factors IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was inhibited. Conclusively, the combination therapy of hUC-MSC + DHEA contributed to restore ovarian function in aging mice and extend their lifespan by restoring hormone levels and inhibiting inflammatory factors."

      "abstract": "This study represents a case of a 42-year-old female patient who had a history of infertility, undergoing treatment at the in vitro fertilization (IVF) centre in Sawangi, India. The patient presented with a medical history marked by recurrent medical termination of pregnancies, a small uterus diagnosed through metroplasty, and a significant impediment to fertility treatment attributed to poor ovarian reserve. Clinical assessment revealed the male partner's history of alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, along with benazepril usage for hypertension (5 mg/day). Despite normal semen parameters, intrauterine insemination (IUI) proved unsuccessful, prompting a recommendation for IVF utilizing the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedure. The patient displayed low anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, indicative of insufficient ovarian reserve. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation was advised orally for a period of one month to enhance ovarian function. Subsequent evaluation demonstrated a notable increase in AMH levels, facilitating the retrieval of six oocytes, comprising average-quality metaphase II (MII) oocytes and one dysmorphic metaphase I (MI) oocyte. Following ICSI, successful fresh embryo transfer ensued, resulting in a positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test with serum β-hCG levels measuring 1676 mIU/mL, confirming the successful implantation of one of the two transplanted embryos. This case underscores the significance of DHEA supplementation in augmenting ovarian reserve and achieving favorable IVF-ICSI outcomes in patients with primary infertility. The holistic approach, encompassing lifestyle modifications and tailored medication, contributed to a positive pregnancy outcome. Further research is warranted to explore the broader implications of DHEA therapy in the management of infertility."

      "abstract": "Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid, AA), as vital micro-nutrient, plays an essential role for male animal reproduction. Previously, we showed that vitamin C reprogrammed the transcriptome and proteome to change phenotypes of porcine immature Sertoli cells (iSCs). Here, we used LC-MS-based non-targeted metabolomics to further investigate the metabolic effects of vitamin C on porcine iSCs. The results identified 43 significantly differential metabolites (DMs) (16 up and 27 down) as induced by vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate, AA2P) treatment of porcine iSCs, which were mainly enriched in steroid related and protein related metabolic pathways. ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) showed that significantly differential metabolites of Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis) and Desmosterol (involved in steroid degradation) were significantly increased, which were partially consistent with metabolomic results. Further integrative analysis of metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data identified the strong correlation between the key differential metabolite of Dehydroepiandrosterone and 6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)/proteins (DEPs) (HMGCS1, P4HA1, STON2, LOXL2, EMILIN2 and CCN3). Further experiments validated that HMGCS1 could positively regulate Dehydroepiandrosterone level. These data indicate that vitamin C could modulate the metabolism profile, and HMGCS1-DHEA could be the pathway to mediate effects exerted by vitamin C on porcine iSCs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread endocrine disorder among women, characterized by symptoms like ovarian cysts, hormonal imbalance, and metabolic issues. This research evaluates the therapeutic potential of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exo) in treating PCOS symptoms within a mouse model. METHODS: BMSC-Exo were isolated from NMRI mice, characterized using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), and administered to a PCOS mouse model induced by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The efficacy of BMSC-Exo was assessed in three groups of mice: a control group, a PCOS group, and a PCOS group treated with intravenous BMSC-Exo. Morphological changes in ovarian tissue were examined by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, apoptosis was determined using the TUNEL assay, and CD31 expression was analyzed through immunofluorescent staining to assess angiogenic activity. RESULTS: The existence of BMSCs-Exo was confirmed via TEM and NTA, revealing their distinct cup-shaped morphology and a size range of 30 to 150 nanometers. H&E staining revealed that BMSCs-Exo treatment improved ovarian morphology in PCOS models, increasing corpora lutea and revitalizing granulosa cell layers, suggesting a reversal of PCOS-induced damage. TUNEL assays showed that BMSCs-Exo treatment significantly reduced apoptosis in PCOS-affected ovarian cells to levels comparable with the control group, highlighting its role in mitigating PCOS-induced cellular apoptosis. Immunofluorescence for CD31 indicated that BMSCs-Exo treatment normalized endothelial marker expression and angiogenic activity in PCOS models, suggesting its effectiveness in modulating the vascular irregularities of PCOS. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of BMSCs-Exo in addressing ovarian dysfunction, cellular apoptosis, and aberrant angiogenesis associated with PCOS. CONCLUSION: The study substantiates the role of BMSC-Exo in mitigating the deleterious effects of PCOS on ovarian tissue, with implications for enhanced follicular development and reduced cellular stress. The modulation of CD31 by BMSC-Exo further highlights their potential in normalizing PCOS-induced vascular anomalies. These findings propel the need for clinical investigations to explore BMSC-Exo as a promising therapeutic avenue for PCOS management.",

Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) for 17-β-estradiol and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry(UHPLC-MS/MS) for 19 17-β-estradiol precursors, a comprehensive analysis of 20steroid hormones was conducted in the serum of mesothelioma patients(n=67), asbestos-exposed healthy subjects(n=39), and non-asbestos-exposed healthy subjects(n=35). Bioinformatics analysis explored three potential serum biomarkers: 17-β-estradiol, DHEA-S, and androstenedione. The results revealed significant differences in 17-β-estradiol levels between mesothelioma patients and both non-asbestos-exposed and asbestos-exposed healthy subjects. No significant variations in serum 17-β-estradiol levels were observed among mesothelioma patients at different stages, suggesting its potential as an early diagnostic marker. 17-β-estradiol levels were similar in mesothelioma patients with environmental and occupational asbestos exposure, while males with occupational asbestos exposure exhibited significantly higher levels of 17-β-estradiol compared to females. Significant reduction in androstenedione and an increase in DHEA-S were observed in asbestos-exposed individuals compared to non-asbestos-exposed individuals. The analysis of DHEA-S-androstenedione-17-β-estradiol signature score showed an increase in asbestos-exposed individuals and mesothelioma patients compared to non-asbestos-exposed individuals, and this score effectively distinguished between the groups. The Cancer Genome Atlas data was utilized to analyze the expression of 5-α-reductase1 and hydroxysteroid-17β-dehydrogenase2 genes. The findings indicated that mesothelioma patients with elevated gene values for 5-α-reductase1 and hydroxysteroid-17β-dehydrogenase2 have a worse or better prognosis on overall survival, respectively. In conclusion, this study suggests 17-β-estradiol, DHEA-S, and androstenedione as biomarkers for mesothelioma risk and early diagnosis of mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed individuals, aiding timely intervention and improved care.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Anxiety is a prevalent comorbidity in lung cancer (LC) patients associated with a decline in quality of life. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a neuroactive steroid, levels rise in response to stress. Prior research on the association between DHEA and anxiety has yielded contradictory results and no study has investigated this association in LC patients. METHODS: A total of 213 patients with LC were recruited from a general hospital. Data on demographic and cancer-related variables were collected. Using the Chinese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the degree of anxiety was determined. Cortisol, DHEA, and Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels in saliva were measured. Adjusting for confounding variables, a multivariate regression analysis was conducted. RESULTS: 147 men and 66 women comprised our group with an average age of 63.75 years. After accounting for demographic and treatment-related factors, anxiety levels were significantly correlated with, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) (β = 0.332, p < 0.001) and fatigue (β = 0.247, p = 0.02). Association between anxiety and three factors, including DHEA, PTSSs, and fatigue, was observed in patients with advanced cancer stages (III and IV) (DHEA β = 0.319, p = 0.004; PTSS β = 0.396, p = 0.001; fatigue β = 0.289, p = 0.027) and those undergoing chemotherapy (DHEA β = 0.346, p = 0.001; PTSS β = 0.407, p = 0.001; fatigue β = 0.326, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The association between anxiety and DHEA remained positive in advanced cancer stages and chemotherapy patients. Further study is necessary to determine whether DHEA is a potential biomarker of anxiety in LC patients.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sex difference in the immune response may influence patients' response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We conducted a prospective observation study to determine the correlation between pretreatment sex hormone levels and response to ICIs in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Method: Pretreatment plasma samples from 61 patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC prior to ICI therapy were collected. Six sex hormone levels [pyrazole triol, 17 β-estradiol, 5-androstenediol, 3β-androstenediol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and S-equol] were measured using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between the high- and low-level groups in the whole cohort. Result: Among the six sex hormones measured, DHEA levels were significantly higher among patients without clinical benefits in the discovery cohort; the remaining sex hormones did not differ significantly. In the whole cohort, median PFS was 22 months for patients with low DHEA levels vs. 3.8 months for those with high DHEA [hazard ratio, 14.23 (95% CI, 4.7-43); p < 0.001]. A significant association was also observed for OS [hazard ratio, 8.2 (95% CI, 2.89-23.35); p < 0.0001]. Conclusions: High pretreatment plasma DHEA levels were associated with poor clinical outcomes for patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with ICIs."

      "abstract": "Treatment response is hard to predict and detailed mechanisms unknown. Lower levels of the dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA(S)) - a precursor to testosterone and estrogen - have been associated to depression and to response to antidepressant treatment. Previous studies however may have been ridden by confounding and reverse causation. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether higher levels of DHEA(S) are causally linked to response to antidepressants using mendelian randomization (MR). We performed a Two-sample MR analysis using data the largest publicly available GWAS of DHEA(S) levels (n = 14,846) using eight common genetic variants associated to DHEA(S) (seven single nucleotide polymorphisms and one variant rs2497306) and the largest GWAS of antidepressant response (n = 5218) using various MR methods (IVW, MR Egger, Weighted mean, weighted mode, MR-PRESSO) and single SNP analysis. We further investigated for pleiotropy conducting a look up on PhenoScanner and GWAS Catalog. Results show no evidence for DHEA(S) gene risk score from any of MR methods, however, we found a significant association on individual variant analysis for rs11761538, rs17277546, and rs2497306. There was some evidence for heterogeneity and pleiotropy. This is the first paper to show some evidence for a causal association of genetically-predicted DHEA and improvement of depressive symptoms. The effect is not a simple linear effect, and we were unable to dissect whether the effect was direct effect of DHEA(S), mediated by DHEA(S) or on the pathway is not yet clear. Further studies using more refined instrumental variables will help clarify this association.",

      "abstract": "Background: DHEA is a steroid hormone produced by the gonads, adrenal cortex, brain, and gastrointestinal tract. While the anti-obesity, anti-atherosclerosis, anti-cancer, and memory-enhancing effects of DHEA have been substantiated through cell experiments, animal studies, and human trials, the precise mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Altered mitochondrial dynamics can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is closely related to many human diseases, especially cancer and aging. This study was to investigate whether DHEA inhibits lung adenocarcinoma through the mitochondrial pathway and its molecular mechanism. Methods: Through animal experiments and cell experiments, the effect of DHEA on tumor inhibition was determined. The correlation between FASTKD2 expression and DHEA was analyzed by Western blot, Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, Immunohistochemistry, and TCGA database. Results: In this study, DHEA supplementation in the diet can inhibit the tumor size of mice, and the effect of adding DHEA one week before the experiment is the best. DHEA limits the glycolysis process by inhibiting G6PDH activity, increases the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and initiates apoptosis in the mitochondrial pathway of cancer cells. Conclusion: DHEA suppresses mitochondrial fission and promotes mitochondrial fusion by downregulating the expression of FASTKD2, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging the overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients, which also provides a new target for the prevention and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma."

Three-month-old female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized and injected intraperitoneally with sesame oil as the control or deoxyvinylcyclohexene (VCD) to induce DOR. The VCD-injected rats were randomized and injected subcutaneously with vehicle as the model group or with DHEA for 21 days as the DHEA group. After being identified in proestrus, rat blood samples were collected to prepare serum samples, and their ovarian tissues were dissected. Compared with the controls, significantly lower serum estradiol (E2), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), and inhibin B (IHNB) and higher follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were detected in the model group (DOR rats). The model group of rats displayed an increase in follicular atresia and a decrease in ovarian volume and the number of growing follicles and corpus luteum, accompanied by increased frequency of oocyte apoptosis and reduced levels of mitochondrial function. Furthermore, significantly higher levels of the AMPK-SIRT1 signaling and mitophagy were observed in the ovaries of rats in the model group. In contrast, treatment with DHEA significantly ameliorated the hormone disorder and morphological changes in the ovaries, reduced the frequency of apoptotic oocytes, and improved mitochondrial function in the ovaries of DOR rats. Mechanistically, DHEA treatment significantly attenuated the AMPK-SIRT1 signaling and mitophagy in the ovaries of DOR rats. DHEA treatment reduced the severity of DOR and enhanced ovarian reserve function by attenuating the AMPK-SIRT1 signaling and mitophagy in the ovaries of rats.",

Our previous study showed that CD19+ B cells were involved in the pathogenesis of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS mice. Here, we studied the therapeutic potential of anti-CD19 antibody (aCD19 Ab) on DHEA-induced PCOS mice. The results showed that aCD19 Ab treatment improved ovarian pathological structure and function of PCOS mice, manifested by an increased number of corpus luteum, a decreased number of cystic follicles and atretic follicles, and regular estrus cycles. The aCD19 Ab treatment reduced the proportion of splenic CD21+ CD23low marginal zone B cells as well as the level of serum IgM and decreased the percentage of peripheral blood and splenic neutrophils. In particular, aCD19 Ab treatment reduced the apoptosis of granulosa cells and macrophage infiltration in ovarian secondary follicles of PCOS mice, as well as the expression of TNF-α in ovarian tissue and serum TNF-α levels. Moreover, we confirmed that TNF-α induced the apoptosis of human ovarian granulosa tumor cell line cells in vitro. Thus, our work demonstrates that aCD19 Ab treatment improves ovarian pathological phenotype and function by reducing local and systemic inflammation in PCOS mice, which may provide a novel insight into PCOS therapy.",

We present the case of a 30-year-old female with 6 previous pregnancies resulting in one live birth and 5 pregnancy losses, including fetal demise at 24 weeks gestation. She had standard investigations after her 4th loss, at a specialized miscarriage clinic. Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, thyroid function, parental karyotypes were all normal. Fetal products confirmed triploidy for her 4th miscarriage at 16 weeks gestation. She was reassured and advised to conceive again but had fetal demise after 24 weeks gestation. This was her 5th pregnancy loss with no explanation. She attended our Restorative Reproductive Medicine (RRM) clinic in January 2022. In addition to poor follicle function, we found hypoandrogenemia for the first time. Treatment included follicle stimulation with clomiphene and DHEA 25 mg twice daily pre-conception with DHEA 20 mg once daily maintained throughout pregnancy. She delivered a healthy baby boy by cesarean section at 36 weeks gestation in November 2023. Hypoandrogenemia should be considered as a contributory factor for women with recurrent miscarriage or late pregnancy loss. Restoration of androgens to normal levels with oral DHEA is safe and can improve pregnancy outcome."

      "abstract": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) poses a great risk to pregnant people and their developing fetus, yet no HCV antiviral treatment guidelines have been established. While there has been a substantial increase in the development of HCV antivirals, the effect they have on the developing fetus remains poorly defined. Many of these drugs are metabolized through the cytochrome P450 CYP3A pathway, which is mediated by cytochrome P450 3A7 (CYP3A7) in the fetus and developing infant. In this study, we sought to investigate the effect HCV antivirals have on CYP3A7 metabolism, as this CYP enzyme plays a vital role in proper fetal and neonatal development. Of the 13 HCV antivirals we investigated, 8 (∼62%) inhibited CYP3A7 metabolic activity by 50% or more at a concentration of 20 µM. Furthermore, paritaprevir, asunaprevir, simeprevir, danoprevir, and glecaprevir all had observed half-maximal inhibitory concentrations between the range of 10 and 20 µM, which is physiologically relevant in comparison with the Km of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) oxidation (reported to be between 5 and 20 µM). We also discovered that paritaprevir is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A7, which shifts the IC50 ∼twofold from 11 µM to 5 µM. Upon further characterization, paritaprevir inactivates DHEA-S metabolism by CYP3A7, with KI and Kinact values of 4.66 µM and 0.00954 minute-1, respectively. Depending on treatment plan and off-label drug use, HCV treatment could adversely affect the fetal-maternal communication axis by blocking fetal CYP3A7 metabolism of important endogenous hormones. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The prevalence of HCV in pregnant people is estimated at between 1% and 8% of the global population, yet little to no information exists about the risk antiviral treatment poses to the developing fetus. There is a potential risk of drugs adversely affecting mother-fetal communication by inhibiting fetal hepatic CYP3A7, an integral enzyme for estriol production. We discovered that five HCV antivirals inhibited DHEA-S metabolism by CYP3A7, and paritaprevir inactivated the enzyme. Our studies demonstrate the potential threat these drugs pose to proper fetal development.",

We sought to determine whether efforts to restore low blood estradiol via estradiol or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation would reduce the risk of miscarriage as part of a multifactorial symptom-based treatment protocol. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included women with low serum estradiol levels in early pregnancy, defined as ≤50% of reference levels by gestational age. Estradiol or DHEA were administered orally, and the primary outcome measure was serum estradiol level, in reference to gestational age. The secondary outcome measures included miscarriage, birth weight, and gestational age at birth. RESULTS: We found no significant effect of estradiol supplementation on serum estradiol levels referenced to gestational age, while DHEA supplementation strongly increased estradiol levels. For pregnancies with low estradiol, the miscarriage rate in the non-supplemented group was 45.5%, while miscarriage rate in the estradiol and DHEA supplemented groups were 21.2% (p = 0.067) and 17.5% (p = 0.038), respectively. Birth weight, size, gestational age, and preterm deliveries were not significantly different. No sexual abnormalities were reported in children (n = 29) of DHEA-supplemented patients after 5-7 years follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, DHEA supplementation restored serum estradiol levels, and when included in the treatment protocol, there was a statistically significant reduction in miscarriage."

[3H]-labeled DHEA consumption was traced in fresh prostatic biopsies ex vivo. Active DHEA utilization was more frequently found in patients with metastatic disease or therapy-resistant disease. Genetic and transcriptomic features associated with the potency of prostatic DHEA utilization were analyzed to generate clinically accessible approaches for patient stratification. UBE3D, by regulating 3βHSD1 homeostasis, was discovered to be a regulator of patient metabolic heterogeneity. Equilin suppressed DHEA utilization and inhibited tumor growth as a potent 3βHSD1 antagonist, providing a promising strategy for the early treatment of aggressive prostate cancer. Overall, our findings indicate that patients with active prostatic DHEA utilization might benefit from 3βHSD1 inhibitors as early intervention.",

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the differentially expressed proteins by CGCs and MGCs of patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and without subsequent exposure to dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and functional differentiation. DESIGN: The present study was observational and experimental study carried out in hospital involving 80 female patients undergoing IVF for infertility. METHODS: In this study, we isolated CGCs and MGCs from the follicular fluid of both PCOS and non-PCOS patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The cells were cultured and treated with DHEAS for 48 hours, and these cells were extracted, digested, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry followed by processing of the results using open-source bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: The present investigation discovered 276 and 341 proteins in CGCs and MGCs, respectively. DHEAS reduced the number of proteins expressed by CGCs and MGCs to 34 and 57 from 91 and 94, respectively. Venn results of CGCs revealed 49, 53, 36, and 21 proteins in normal CGCs, PCOS-CGCs, post-DHEAS, and PCOS-CGCs, respectively. Venn analysis of MGCs showed 51 proteins specific to PCOS and 29 shared by normal and PCOS samples after DHEAS therapy. MGCs express the most binding and catalytic proteins, whereas CGCs express transporter-related proteins. A protein pathway study demonstrated considerable differences between normal and PCOS samples, while DHEAS-treated samples of both cell lines showed distinct pathways. String findings identified important network route components such as albumin, actin, apolipoprotein, complement component C3, and heat shock protein. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show how DHEAS-induced stress affects the expression of proteins by MGCs and CGCs isolated from normal and PCOS patients. Further studies are recommended to identify PCOS biomarkers from CGCs and MGCs expressed under the influence of DHEAS."

AIM: To review the results of DHEA use in rheumatic diseases. METHODS: PubMed, Scielo, Scopus, and Embase databases were systematically searched for articles on the treatment of rheumatic diseases with DHEA between 1966 and April 2023. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were identified: 13 in SLE, 5 in SS, 2 in RA, and 1 in fibromyalgia. DHEA use in SLE has shown a mild to moderate effect on disease activity, a positive effect on bone mineral density (BMD), and improved fatigue. The studies on SS showed a decrease in symptoms of dry mouth, but its performance did not differ from placebo in disease activity. In RA, a questionable effect on disease activity was noted. The only study on fibromyalgia failed to show any improvement. The drug was well tolerated; mild androgenic effects were the most common complaints. CONCLUSION: DHEA seems to have a place in SLE treatment, where it improves BMD and disease activity. The use in RA, SS, and FM is questionable."

This study examined the efficacy of etanercept (ETA), an anti-TNF-α drug, in alleviating endocrine, metabolic, and vascular dysfunction in a rat model of PCOS. Prepubertal female Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control, PCOS, and PCOS+ETA. The PCOS groups received dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatment, whereas the PCOS+ETA group received both DHEA and ETA. After 35 days, various biomarkers were evaluated, including systemic blood pressure, endothelial function, and eNOS and TNF-α expression levels in the thoracic aorta and ovaries. The PCOS group exhibited ovarian morphological changes, increased body weight, and hormonal imbalances, whereas the PCOS+ETA group showed restored levels of these parameters. Systemic blood pressure, urinary albumin levels, and protein excretion did not differ significantly differ among the groups. Endothelium-dependent relaxation, eNOS expression, TNF-α expression in the thoracic aorta, and TNF-α expression in the ovaries were restored to normal levels in the PCOS+ETA group. Furthermore, ovarian morphology was improved in the PCOS+ETA group. In conclusion, etanercept treatment shows promise in mitigating hormonal disturbances and vascular dysfunction in patients with PCOS, suggesting potential therapeutic advantages.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) are used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) to stop a resurgence of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Despite early success, patients on ARSIs eventually relapse, develop drug resistance, and succumb to the disease. Resistance may occur through intratumoral steroidogenesis mediated by upregulation of aldo-keto reductase family 1C member 3 (AKR1C3). Patients treated with leuprolide (castrate) and those treated with leuprolide plus abiraterone (post-Abi) harbor a reservoir of DHEA-S which could fuel testosterone (T) biosynthesis via AKR1C3 to cause a resurgence of prostate cancer cell growth. We demonstrate that concentrations of DHEA-S found in castrate and post-Abi patients are (i) converted to T in an AKR1C3-dependent manner in prostate cancer cells, and (ii) in amounts sufficient to stimulate AKR1C3-dependent cell growth. We observed this in primary and metastatic prostate cancer cell lines, CWR22PC and DuCaP, respectively. Androgen measurements were made by stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS. We demonstrate AKR1C3 dependence using stable short hairpin RNA knockdown and pharmacologic inhibitors. We also demonstrate that free DHEA is reduced to 5-androstene-3β,17β-diol (5-Adiol) by AKR1C3 and that this is a major metabolite, suggesting that in our cell lines 5-Adiol is a predominant precursor of T. We have identified a mechanism of ARSI resistance common to both primary and metastatic cell lines that is dependent on the conversion of DHEA to 5-Adiol on route to T catalyzed by AKR1C3. SIGNIFICANCE: We show that reservoirs of DHEA-S that remain after ARSI treatment are converted into T in primary and metastatic prostate cancer cells in amounts sufficient to stimulate cell growth. Pharmacologic and genetic approaches demonstrate that AKR1C3 is required for these effects. Furthermore, the route to T proceeds through 5-Adiol. We propose that this is a mechanism of ARSI drug resistance.",

AIM: Based on previous evidence, the purpose of this systematic review and network meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of DHEA, CoQ10, GH and TEAS on pregnancy outcomes in POR patients undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transplantation (IVF-ET). In addition, we aimed to determine the current optimal adjuvant treatment strategies for POR. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library and four databases in China (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed) were systematically searched up to July 30, 2022, with no restrictions on language. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adjuvant treatment strategies (DHEA, CoQ10, GH and TEAS) before IVF-ET to improve pregnancy outcomes in POR patients, while the control group received a controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) regimen only. This study was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to provide a pooled measure of cumulative ranking for each outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs (2323 women) with POR defined using the Bologna criteria were included in the network meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, CoQ10 (OR 2.22, 95% CI: 1.05 to 4.71) and DHEA (OR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.16 to 3.16) had obvious advantages in improving the clinical pregnancy rate. CoQ10 was the best in improving the live birth rate (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.07 to 5.38). DHEA increased the embryo implantation rate (OR 2.80, 95%CI: 1.41 to 5.57) and the high-quality embryo rate (OR 2.01, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.78) and number of oocytes retrieved (WMD 1.63, 95% CI: 0.34 to 2.92) showed a greater advantage, with GH in second place. Several adjuvant treatment strategies had no significant effect on reducing the cycle canceling rate compared with the control group. TEAS was the least effective of the four adjuvant treatments in most pooled results, but the overall effect appeared to be better than that of the control group. CONCLUSION: Compared with COS regimen, the adjuvant use of CoQ10, DHEA and GH before IVF may have a better clinical effect on the pregnancy outcome of POR patients. TEAS needs careful consideration in improving the clinical pregnancy rate. Future large-scale RCTs with direct comparisons are needed to validate or update this conclusion.

We conducted a literature search of Pub-Med, Ovid MEDLINE, and SCOPUS (inception to June 2022) for all relevant articles, including the keywords of \"dehydroepiandrosterone/DHEA\", \"oocyte\", and \"cumulus cells\". From the preliminary search, 69 publications were identified, and following a thorough screening process, seven studies were ultimately incorporated into the final review. Four hundred twenty-four women were enrolled in these studies, with DHEA supplementation being administered exclusively to women exhibiting poor ovarian response/diminished ovarian reserve or belonging to an older age demographic. The intervention in the studies was DHEA 75-90 mg daily for at least 8-12 weeks. The only randomized controlled trial showed no difference in clinical or cumulus cell-related outcomes between the control and treatment groups. However, the remaining six studies (two cohorts, four case-controls) showed significant beneficial effects of DHEA in cumulus cell-related outcomes compared to the group (older age or POR/DOR) without DHEA supplementation. All studies revealed no significant difference in stimulation and pregnancy outcomes. Our review concludes that DHEA supplementation did show beneficial effect on ovarian cumulus cells in improving oocyte quality for women of advanced age or with poor ovarian responders."

Treatment options for these patients are limited and there is no consensus to make any recommendations. Regarding adjuvant supplements, DHEA could play a role in follicular recruitment and, therefore, may increase spontaneous pregnancy rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a monocentric historical and observational cohort study carried out in the reproductive medicine department at the University Hospital, Femme-Mère-Enfant in Lyon. All women presenting with a diminished ovarian reserve treated with 75mg/day of DHEA were consecutively included. The main objective was to evaluate the spontaneous pregnancy rate. The secondary objectives were to identify predictive factors for pregnancy and the evaluation of treatment side effects. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-nine women were included. In all, 277 were analyzed, 59 had a spontaneous pregnancy (21.3%). The probability of being pregnant was respectively 13.2% (IC95 9-17.2%), 21.3% (IC95 15.1-27%) and 38.8% (IC95 29.3-48.4%) at 6, 12 and 24 months. Only 20.6% of patients complained of side effects.

      "abstract": "The vagina is traditionally thought of as a passive organ in the female reproductive system, serving primarily as a passageway for menstrual blood, sexual intercourse and childbirth. However, recent research has shed light on the vagina's role as an endocrine organ that plays a crucial role in female hormonal balance and overall health. Particularly, growing evidence shows that the human vagina can be considered both as source and target of androgens, in view of the novel concept of 'intracrinology'. Besides the well-known role of estrogens, androgens are also crucial for the development and maintenance of healthy genitourinary tissues in women. As androgen levels decline with age, and estrogen levels fall during the menopausal transition, the tissues in the vagina, together with those in the urinary tract, become thinner, drier and less elastic, leading to a variety of uncomfortable and sometimes painful symptoms, clustered in the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Given the lack of testosterone-based or androstenedione-based products approved by regulatory agencies to treat GSM, the possibility of using intravaginal prasterone, which works by providing a local source of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to the vaginal tissues, appears to be a targeted treatment. Further studies are needed to better assess its safety and efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a perplexing condition in females of reproductive age. Dysplasia of ovarian granulosa cell (GC) is implicated in PCOS. Follicular fluid (FF)-extracellular vesicles (Evs) are important in cell-cell communication during follicular development. The current study elaborated on the function and mechanism of FF-Evs in the viability and apoptosis of GC cells in PCOS development. Human GC cells KGN were treated with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to mimic a PCOS-like condition in vitro, which were further co-cultured with the FF-derived Evs (FF-Evs). The FF-Evs treatment significantly reduced DHEA-induced apoptosis of KGN cells while promoting cell viability and migration. The lncRNA microarray analysis showed that FF-Evs mainly deliver LINC00092 into the KGN cells. Knockdown of LINC00092 negated the protective effect of FF-Evs against DHEA-induced damage on KGN cells. Moreover, by performing bioinformatics analyses and biotin-labeled RNA pull-down assay, we found that LINC00092 could bind to the RNA binding protein LIN28B and inhibit its binding to pre-microRNA-18-5p, which allowed biogenesis of pre-miR-18-5p and increased the expression of miR-18b-5p, a miRNA with known alleviating role in PCOS by suppressing the PTEN mRNA. Collectively, the present work demonstrates that FF-Evs can alleviate DHEA-induced GC damage by delivering LINC00092.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis abnormalities in major depression (MDD) have been consistently reported in psychiatry and extend to several neurosteroids. However, recurrence and chronicity may heavily influence HPA axis dynamics in MDD along its course and also explain conflicting results in literature. Thus, the mechanistic understanding of HPA axis (re)activity changes over time could be of major importance for unravelling the dynamic pathophysiology of MDD. METHODS: This study simultaneously assessed several baseline and dynamic HPA-axis-related endocrine biomarkers in both saliva (dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA; sulfated DHEA, DHEA-s; cortisol, CORT) and plasma (CORT; adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH; copeptin, CoP) over three consecutive days using overnight HPA axis stimulation (metyrapone) and suppression (dexamethasone) challenges in order to investigate differences between antidepressant-free MDD patients (n = 14) with and without history of prior depressive episodes (i.e., first vs. recurrent episode). RESULTS: Our results suggest group differences only with respect to saliva DHEA levels, with recurrent-episode MDD patients showing overall lower saliva DHEA levels across the three days, and statistically significant differences mainly at day 1 (baseline) across all three timepoints (awakening, +30 min, +60 min), even after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports that salivary DHEA levels could represent a significant biomarker of MDD progression and individual stress resilience. DHEA deserves additional attention in the research of pathophysiology, staging and individualized treatment of MDD. Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate HPA axis reactivity along MDD course and progression to better understand temporal effects on stress-system-related alterations, related phenotypes and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the novel mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is low-grade chronic inflammation. Chamomile (Matricaria recutita L.) and Nettle (Urtica dioica), with phytoestrogenic and antioxidant properties, are traditionally used to treat gynecological diseases. This study investigated the immune-modulating effects of these two plants. METHODS: Following the induction of PCOS by subcutaneous injection (SC) of Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in BALB / C mice. Mice were treated in five groups: Sham, PCOS, PCOS + Chamomile, PCOS + Nettle, and PCOS + Chamomile and Nettle for 21 days. Ovarian morphology, blood antioxidant capacity, the abundance of Treg cells, and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß), cyclooxygenase-2 genes (COX-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were measured. RESULTS: Folliculogenesis, Cystic follicles, and corpus luteum improved in the treatment groups (P < 0. 05). Treg cells in the DHEA group were significantly reduced compared to the Sham group (P < 0. 01). However, this decrease was not corrected in treatment groups (P > 0. 05). Total serum antioxidant capacity was significantly increased in the treatment group of Nettle and Chamomile + Nettle (P < 0. 05). The expression of MMP9 and TGFβ genes in the PCOS group was significantly higher than the Sham group (P < 0. 05), which the expression of MMP9 was corrected by treatment with Chamomile + Nettle extract (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Chamomile and Nettle extract may be an effective supplement in improving the histological and immunological changes of PCOS. However, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in humans.",

METHODS: Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were subcutaneously injected with dehydroepiandrosteron (DHEA) to establish PCOS model. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) were used to measure histological changes and apoptosis of ovary tissues. The levels of serum hormones and inflammatory factors in ovary tissues were measured by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: In DHEA-induced PCOS rats, the levels of serum glucose, insulin, testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) were enhanced, estradiol (E2), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were decreased, inflammatory levels and apoptosis of ovary tissues were increased. Additionally, DHEA increased the body weight, ovary weight, and ovary volume, cystic follicles, and decreased corpus luteum. Moreover, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway was activated in PCOS rats. The levels of TNF receptor superfamily member 1 A (TNFR1), TNF-α, and fas cell surface death feceptor (FAS) were enhanced in ovary tissues of DHEA induced PCOS rats. Isorhamnetin (ISO) treatment after DHEA modeling markedly reduced serum levels of glucose, insulin, testosterone and LH, increased E2, SHBG, FSH level, decreased inflammatory levels, and inhibited apoptosis and decreased body weight, ovary weight, and ovary volume. The levels of TNFR1, TNF-α, and FAS were markedly decreased after ISO treatment in PCOS rats. Additionally, ISO alone had no significant effect on rats. CONCLUSION: Isorhamnetin inhibits inflammatory response to alleviate DHEA-induced PCOS in rats by inactivating the TNF signaling pathway.",

Our previous results demonstrated that tempol was able to ameliorate PCOS phenotype in rats. However, the exact pathophysiological effect of tempol on PCOS remains largely unknown. To extend this research, deep RNA-sequencing was performed to investigate the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) associated ceRNA mechanisms in the ovarian tissues of control rats, dehydropiandrosterone (DHEA) induced PCOS rats and tempol treated PCOS rats. Our results identified total 164, 79, and 914 significantly dysregulated lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in three groups, respectively. The total of 7 lncRNAs, 8 mRNAs and 5 miRNAs were involved in lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks were constructed. Among them, mRNAs including C1qtnf1, Dipk2a, IL4r and lncRNAs including MSTRG.16751.2, MSTRG.8065.2 had high RNA connectivity in the ceRNA network, which also showed significant alterations in these three groups by using qPCR validation. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that the involvement of the identified ceRNA networks in regulating the development of PCOS from distinct origins, such as metabolic pathway, immune cell differentiation. The study presents the first systematic dissection of lncRNA-associated ceRNA profiles in tempol treated PCOS rats.

This study aimed to discover the association between serum DHEA levels and immunologic response in people with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). We enrolled patients aged ≥ 18 years who were treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We measured CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, HIV-RNA titres, and serum DHEA levels. We assigned each patient to a good- or poor-responder group depending on their CD4+ T-cell counts at study enrolment. Participants with CD4+ T-cell counts > 200/µL were assigned to the good-responder group, whilst those with CD4+ T-cell counts < 200/µL were assigned to the poor-responder group. The participants were followed up for 2 years. The poor-responder group showed lower CD4+ T-cell counts and higher HIV PCR titres at their initial HIV diagnosis and in their 2-year follow-up data. Serum DHEA level was lower in the poor-responder group. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that BMI, initial CD4+ T-cell counts, and serum DHEA level were clinical factors associated with poor immunologic responsiveness to cART in PLWHA. Therefore, DHEA may be used as an indicator of the immunological recovery of PLWHA."

Methods : Patients (n=215) requiring daily or intermittent hydrocortisone replacement, or no replacement were retrospectively checked with their peak cortisol after CRH test and baseline DHEA-S. Results :  None of 106 patients with the peak cortisol ≥ 17.5 µg / dL after CRH test required replacement, and all 64 patients with the peak cortisol < 10.0 µg / dL required daily replacement. Among 8 patients with 10.0 µg / dL ≤ the peak cortisol < 17.5 µg / dL and baseline DHEA-S below the reference range, 6 patients required daily replacement and 1 patient was under intermittent replacement.

      "abstract": "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is the most abundant steroid hormone in primates, which is predominantly synthesized in the adrenal cortex. A characteristic curve of growth and decline of its synthesis during life was observed, together with the corresponding formation of its sulphate ester (DHEAS). High levels of plasma circulating DHEA are suggested as a marker of human longevity, and various pathophysiological conditions lead to a decreased DHEA level, including adrenal insufficiency, severe systemic diseases, acute stress, and anorexia. More recent studies have established the importance of DHEA in the central nervous system (CNS). A specific intranuclear receptor for DHEA has not yet been identified; however, highly specific membrane receptors have been detected in endothelial cells, the heart, kidney, liver, and the brain. Research shows that DHEA and DHEAS, as well as their metabolites, have a wide range of effects on numerous organs and organ systems, which places them in the group of potential pharmacological agents useful in various clinical entities. Their action as neurosteroids is especially interesting due to potential neuroprotective, pro-cognitive, anxiolytic, and antidepressant effects. Evidence from clinical studies supports the use of DHEA in hypoadrenal individuals and in treating depression and associated cognitive disorders. However, there is also an increasing trend of recreational DHEA misuse in healthy people, as it is classified as a dietary supplement in some countries. This article aims to provide a critical review regarding the biological and pharmacological effects of DHEA, its mechanism of action, and potential therapeutic use, especially in CNS disorders.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Current treatment options for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are limited, especially for cases with cancer stem cell-induced chemoresistance and recurrence. The WNT signaling pathway contributes to maintenance of stemness via translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus, and represents a promising druggable target in HNSCC. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a steroid hormone, has potential as an anticancer drug. However, the potential anticancer mechanisms of DHEA including inhibition of stemness, and its therapeutic applications in HNSCC remain unclear. METHODS: Firstly, SRB assay and sphere formation assay were used to examine cellular viability and cancer stem cell-like phenotype, respectively. The expressions of stemness related factors were measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The luciferase reporter assay was applied to evaluate transcriptional potential of stemness related pathways. The alternations of WNT signaling pathway were measured by nuclear translocation of β-catenin, RT-qPCR and western blotting. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of drugs in vivo, both HNSCC orthotopic and subcutaneous xenograft mouse models were applied. RESULTS: We found that DHEA reduced HNSCC cell viability, suppressed sphere formation, and inhibited the expression of cancer-stemness markers, such as BMI-1 and Nestin. Moreover, DHEA repressed the transcriptional activity of stemness-related pathways. In the WNT pathway, DHEA reduced the nuclear translocation of the active form of β-catenin and reduced the protein expression of the downstream targets, CCND1 and CD44. Furthermore, when combined with the chemotherapeutic drug, irinotecan (IRN), DHEA enhanced the sensitivity of HNSCC cells to IRN as revealed by reduced cell viability, sphere formation, expression of stemness markers, and activation of the WNT pathway. Additionally, this combination reduced in vivo tumor growth in both orthotopic and subcutaneous xenograft mouse models. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that DHEA has anti-stemness potential in HNSCC and serves as a promising anticancer agent. The combination of DHEA and IRN may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with advanced HNSCC."

      "abstract": "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an androgen synthesized by the adrenal cortex, which is an intermediary in the biosynthesis of sex hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol. DHEA mostly circulates as a conjugated ester, in the form of sulfate (DHEA-S). There exist several endogenous factors able to influence its synthesis, the most common ones being the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), growth factors, and proinflammatory cytokines, among others. Like other steroid hormones, DHEA, can alter the functioning of immune cells and therefore the course of diseases exhibiting an immune-inflammatory component, mostly from autoimmune or infectious nature. We herein review the role played by DHEA during a major infectious disease like tuberculosis (TB). Data recorded from TB patients, mouse models, or in vitro studies show that DHEA is likely to be implied in better disease control. This provides a stimulating background for carrying out clinical studies aimed at assessing the usefulness of DHEA as an adjuvant in TB patients.",

Multiple gene abnormalities like Ar, Cyp19a1, Hsd3b1, Srd5a1, Bcl-2, and Bax genes are associated with PCOS. Herein, the PCOS model was induced by oral administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Metformin (Met) is one of the most common drugs affecting the most relevant genes involved in PCOS development but with unwanted side effects. Natural treatments have been known for their safer effects. Spirulina (SP) is a type of blue-green algae that contains nutrients and compounds that would treat PCOS and lower the possible side effects of Met in combination therapy. We aim to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of SP on PCOS by multi confirmatory tests and to demonstrate its effects on regulating the expression of multiple genes that are responsible for the occurrence of PCOS in comparison to Met. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, sixty adult female Wistar albino rats were subdivided into equal six groups with 10 rats in each group. All drugs were given orally once daily for one month. The expression of Ar, Cyp19a1, Hsd3b1, Srd5a1, Bcl-2, and Bax genes, were examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: The present study showed that SP has a remarkable effect on the reduction of the development of PCOS by regulating the expression of the examined genes. As a result, it may be a useful therapy alternative for PCOS complications, symptoms, and infertility as well. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, SP is considered a promising therapeutic drug in the treatment of PCOS-like symptoms induced by DHEA.",

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation has been reported to have variable efficacious in improving female sexual dysfunction (FSD) in several trials but studies using DHEA in SS are not available. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the use of DHEA supplementation in patients with SS. METHODS: In this crossover trial, 28 participants with SS (age 39.7 ± 8.6 years) were divided into 2 groups (using block randomization) who received DHEA supplements (25 mg twice daily) or matched placebo sequentially for 3 months each. Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) score and serum DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) were measured at baseline and after completion of each phase. Glycemic parameters, lipid profile, and liver enzymes were also measured to assess metabolic side effects. RESULTS: There was significant improvement in FSFI score from baseline to end of the study in the DHEA group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.006). Mean FSFI score and most of the individual domains of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) improved with DHEA significantly in both groups (P = 0.001 for each group with DHEA). In those who received DHEA first followed by placebo, FSFI declined significantly after placebo (P = 0.041) but remained at an acceptable level of sexual functioning. Serum DHEAS increased significantly with DHEA treatment. No significant changes in glycemic index, lipid profile, and liver enzymes were noted with DHEA treatment. CONCLUSION: A short duration of DHEA supplementation in women with SS with FSD is efficacious and safe.",

Previous studies have suggested that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may improve IVF outcomes in POR. The current study attempts to investigate the clinical benefits of DHEA in POR and the possible mechanism of DHEA on cumulus cells (CCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 women who underwent IVF treatment participated, including 22 normal ovarian responders (NORs) and 38 PORs. PORs were assigned to receive DHEA supplementation (n = 18) or not (n = 20) before IVF cycles. For all patients, CCs were obtained after oocyte retrieval. In the CCs, mRNA expression of mitochondrial dynamics relataed genes were measured. RESULTS: Supplementation of DHEA in POR reduced mitochondrial fission in CCs and decreased the expression of PGAM5 in CCs. CONCLUSION: The benefit of DHEA supplementation on IVF outcomes in POR is significant, and this effect may be mediated in part through improved mitochondrial dynamics in CC.",

METHODS: The gene expression profiles of GSE132305, GSE89749, and GSE45001 were obtained respectively from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The DEGs were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles of cholangiocarcinoma and normal tissues. GO, KEGG analysis and PPI network analyses were performed. LibDock, ADME and toxicity prediction, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to identify potential inhibitors of MYC. Moreover, in vitro, MTT assay, colony-forming assay, the scratch assay and Western blotting were performed to verify the therapeutic effect of Dhea and 2-14,15-Eg. RESULTS: PPI network analysis showed that ALB, MYC, APOB, IGF1 and KNG1 were hub genes, of which MYC was mainly studied in this study. A battery of computer-aided virtual techniques showed that Dhea and 2-14,15-Eg have lower rodent carcinogenicity, Ames mutagenicity, developmental toxicity potential, and high tolerance to cytochrome P4502D6, as well as could exist stably in natural circumstances. In vitro assays showed that Dhea and 2-14,15-Eg inhibited cholangiocarcinoma cellular viability, proliferation, and migration inhibiting expression of MYC. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that Dhea and 2-14,15-Eg were novel potential inhibitors of MYC targeting, as well as are a promising drug in dealing with cholangiocarcinoma and have a perspective application.",

Cortisol and DHEA are steroid hormones with opposing effects, thus using Cortisol/DHEA ratio (C/D) rather than the use of either hormone alone has been found to predict health outcomes more reliably. It was interesting to study C/D as an indicator of favorable metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes after BS. OBJECTIVE: To assess C/D in morbidly obese patients before and after BS in relation to metabolic parameters and cardiovascular performance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty morbidly obese patients were followed prospectively for 1 year after BS. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FI), C/D, lipid profile, high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP), and echocardiography were done before BS and at 3 months and 1 year post BS. RESULTS: A total of 40 morbidly obese patients undergone sleeve gastrectomy. Blood pressure, FBG, FI, hs-CRP, C/D were significantly decreased after BS (p < 0.001). At 1 year post BS; significant reduction in left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW) (p < 0.001), left ventricular mass (LVM) (p = 0.003), relative wall thickness (RWT) (p < 0.001) with a significant improvement in early diastolic velocity (E) (p < 0.001), early diastolic velocity/late diastolic velocity (E/A) (p = 0.01). After BS; C/D significantly positively correlated with FBG (p = 0.019), hs-CRP (p = 0.008), interventricular septum thickness (IVS) (p = 0.028), LVPW (p = 0.028), relative wall thickness (RWT) (p = 0.022), early diastolic velocity /early diastolic velocity (E') measured by pulsed tissue Doppler imaging (E/E') (p = 0.001), and significantly negatively correlated with E' (p = 0.032). C/D was the single significant independent variable affecting E' and E/E' post BS. CONCLUSION: C/D can be used as a surrogate marker of the improved FBG and the resolution of inflammation post BS. C/D is an independent predictor of diastolic function improvement post BS.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an important precursor of androgen and has been studied and researched extensively for improving the various outcome measures of ovarian stimulation in women with advanced age or poor ovarian response. Androgens also play an important role in the enhancement of endometrial and decidual function by regulating both the transcriptome and secretome of the endometrial stromal cells and have a positive effect on various factors like insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1, homeobox genes (HOXA10, HOXA11), secreted phosphoprotein 1, prolactin which are necessary for implantation. It is well-known that the circulating 'precursor pool' of DHEA declines with age more so in poor ovarian reserve patients and exogenous supplementation may be beneficial in such cases. This double-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to test the hypothesis whether transient targeted supplementation of DHEA as an adjuvant to progesterone in frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles, for women with low serum testosterone, helps in improving live birth rate. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is planned as a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial and the sample size, calculated for the primary outcome measure-live birth rate, is 140. All participants will be having a flexible antagonist protocol for controlled ovarian stimulation and an elective freeze-all policy for the embryos as per the hospital protocol after written informed consent. For FET, the endometrium will be prepared by hormone replacement treatment protocol. During the FET cycle, the intervention group will be receiving DHEA 25 mg two times a day for 15 days from the day of starting progesterone supplementation and the control group will be receiving a placebo. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The approval of the study was granted by the Clinical Trials Registry-India and the Institutional Ethical Committee of CRAFT Hospital and Research Center. All participants will provide written informed consent before being randomised into allocated treatment groups. The results will be disseminated to doctors and patients through conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, social media and patient information booklets.

      "abstract": "Objective: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by liver failure and by an impaired neurotransmission and neurological function caused by hyperammonemia (HA). HE, in turn, decreases the phosphorylation of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε), contributing to the impairment of neuronal functions. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) exerts a neuroprotective effect by increasing the GABAergic tone through GABAA receptor stimulation. Therefore, we investigated the protective effect of DHEA in an animal model of HE, and the possible modulation of PKCε expression in different brain area. Methods: Fulminant hepatic failure was induced in 18 male, Sprague-Dawley rats by i.p. administration of 3 g/kg D-galactosamine, and after 30 min, a group of animals received a subcutaneous injection of 25 mg/kg (DHEA) repeated twice a day (3 days). Exploratory behavior and general activity were evaluated 24 h and 48 h after the treatments by the open field test. Then, brain cortex and cerebellum were used for immunoblotting analysis of PKCε level. Results: DHEA administration showed a significant improvement of locomotor activity both 24 and 48 h after D-galactosamine treatment (**** p < 0.0001) but did not ameliorate liver parenchymal degeneration. Western blot analysis revealed a reduced immunoreactivity of PKCε (* p < 0.05) following D-galactosamine treatment in rat cortex and cerebellum. After the addition of DHEA, PKCε increased in the cortex in comparison with the D-galactosamine-treated (*** p < 0.001) and control group (* p < 0.05), but decreased in the cerebellum (* p < 0.05) with respect to the control group. PKCε decreased after treatment with NH4Cl alone and in combination with DHEA in both cerebellum and cortex (**** p < 0.0001). MTS assay demonstrated the synergistic neurotoxic action of NH4Cl and glutamate pretreatment in cerebellum and cortex along with an increased cell survival after DHEA pretreatment, which was significant only in the cerebellum (* p < 0.05). Conclusion: An association between the DHEA-mediated increase of PKCε expression and the improvement of comatose symptoms was observed. PKCε activation and expression in the brain could inhibit GABA-ergic tone counteracting HE symptoms. In addition, DHEA seemed to ameliorate the symptoms of HE and to increase the expression of PKCε in cortex and cerebellum."

DESIGN: This study performed 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis on dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS rats treated with berberine, focusing on the improvement of PCOS-IR by modifying gut microbiota and metabolism. METHODS: Forty-two female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 experimental groups of 8 rats each (PCOS + HFD, PCOS + HFD + BBR, NCD + PCOS, and NCD + PCOS + BBR groups). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index-related indicators and hormone level in serum were analyzed. 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis were performed on DHEA-induced PCOS rats treated with berberine. In addition, the differential microbiotas and metabolites were screened. Also, enrichment analysis was carried out on the differential metabolites. Finally, we constructed a correlation network to analyze the correlation between differential microbiotas and metabolites. RESULTS: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were changed at the phylum level, and Romboutsia, Bacteroides, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 were changed at the genus level after berberine treatment. In addition, a total of 26 differential operational taxonomic units and 3 metabolites (glutamine, unsaturated acids [CH = CH], and glucose) between 2 groups were obtained. Moreover, these metabolites were mainly involved in type 2 diabetes mellitus, 2-component system, and ABC transporter Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. And, 3 microbiotas (Lachnospiraceae_NC2004_group, Flavonifractor, and Parasutterella) were regulated by glucose and glutamine. LIMITATIONS: The sample size involved in this study is relatively small. In addition, relevant experiments need to be performed to verify the obtained results from this study, and in-depth functional studies are needed. CONCLUSIONS: Berberine is effective in improving the pathological condition in PCOS by regulating the gut microbiotas and metabolites. This study will provide evidence for therapeutic efforts to treat PCOS-IR using berberine.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we induced osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs derived from elders using an osteogenic induction medium with or without DHEA. The results showed that osteogenic induction medium (OIM) with DHEA could significantly promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs than OIM alone. By using a Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology, we screened out 604 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with at least one unique peptide were identified [524: OIM vs. complete medium (CM), and 547: OIM+DHEA vs. CM], among these proteins, 467 DEPs were shared in these two different comparative groups. Bioinformatic analysis revealed these DEPs are mainly enriched in metabolic pathways. Interestingly, the expression levels of the DEPs in the metabolic pathways showed a more noticeable change in the OIM+DHEA vs. CM group than OIM vs. CM group. Moreover, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed that three potential proteins, ATP5B, MT-CYB, and MT-ATP6, involved in energy metabolism, might play a key role in osteogenic differentiation induced by OIM+DHEA. These findings offer a valuable clue for us to better understand the underlying mechanisms involved in osteoblast differentiation of hBMSCs caused by DHEA and assist in applying DHEA in hBMSCs-based therapy for osteogenic regeneration."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of dulaglutide on DHEA induced PCOS rats and its mechanism, to provide new drugs and research directions for clinical treatment of PCOS. METHODS: In this study, the PCOS model was established by giving female SD rats subcutaneous injection of DHEA for 21 consecutive days. After modeling, the treatment group was injected subcutaneously with three doses of dulaglutide for 3 weeks. The model group was injected with sterile ultrapure water, and the normal group did not get any intervention. The body weight changes of rats in each group were recorded from the first day when rats received the administration of dulaglutide. Three weeks later, the rats were fasted the night after the last treatment, determined fasting insulin and fasting glucose the next day. After the rats were anesthetized by chloral hydrate, more blood was collected from the heart of the rat. The serum insulin, testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels were detected by the enzyme-linked immunoassay method. After removing the adipose tissue, the obtained rat ovary tissue was used for subsequent experimental detection, using HE staining for morphology and follicular development analysis; qRT-PCR for the detection of 3βHSD, CYP17α1, CYP19α1, and StAR gene expression in ovarian tissue; and western blotting analysis of CYP17α1, CYP19α1, StAR protein expression and insulin level to verify whether dulaglutide has a therapeutic effect on PCOS in rats. RESULTS: After treated with different concentrations of dulaglutide, we found that the body weight of rats in the treatment groups were reduced. Compared with the rats in PCOS group, the serum androgen level of rats in the treatment groups was significantly decreased, and the serum sex hormone binding protein content was significantly increased, and there was statistically significant difference between these groups and PCOS group. In terms of protein expression and gene regulation, the expression of 3βHSD, CYP19α1 and StAR in the ovarian tissue of rats in treatment groups were decreased significantly after received the treatment of dulaglutide, and there was statistically significant difference between these groups and PCOS group. In addition, dulaglutide reduced the insulin content in the ovarian tissue of PCOS rats. CONCLUSION: Dulaglutide may reduce the hyperandrogenemia of PCOS rats by regulating the content of serum SHBG and the expression of 3βHSD, CYP19α1, and StAR related genes and proteins, thereby inhibiting the excessive development of small follicles and the formation of cystic follicles in the ovaries of PCOS rats, thereby improving polycystic ovary in PCOS rats. In addition, dulaglutide may reduce the weight of PCOS rats, further reducing the level of high androgen in PCOS rats, and improving the morphology of their polycystic ovaries.",

      "abstract": "The rationale was to explore the efficacy/sensitivity of using morning and evening cortisol levels as biomarkers for stress reduction in persons with dementia (PWDs) and their family caregivers (FCGs) participating in a music intervention program. Thirty-two PWD and their FGC were recruited to an 8-week, home-based music intervention program. Daily home-based collection of saliva samples took place at bedtime and upon awakening. Cortisol was analyzed in the morning and evening saliva samples and DHEA-s in the morning samples. Trends over 40 workdays (15-40 observations per subject) were assessed using linear regression analysis. Twenty-three PWD (72% of invited, 16 men and 7 women, age 69-93) and 24 caregivers (75%, 8 men and 16 women, age 37-90) completed the intervention for at least 6 weeks and were included in the analysis. One-fourth of the PWD and FCG had decreasing evening cortisol, accompanied by decreasing morning cortisol levels. In one-fourth of the participants the ratio between cortisol and DHEA-S in the morning samples was improved, indicating improved balance between energy mobilization and regeneration. Several participants showed no significant endocrine change. There was a statistically significant (two-sided test) correlation within the PWD-caregiver dyads in evening cortisol trend and a statistically significant decrease (two-sided test) in the morning-evening cortisol slope for the FCG group.

      "abstract": "Bone metastasis is a complication of prostate cancer in up to 90% of men afflicted with advanced disease. Therapies that reduce androgen exposure remain at the forefront of treatment. However, most prostate cancers transition to a state whereby reducing testicular androgen action becomes ineffective. A common mechanism of this transition is intratumoral production of testosterone (T) using the adrenal androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) through enzymatic conversion by 3β- and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3βHSD and 17βHSD). Given the ability of prostate cancer to form blastic metastases in bone, we hypothesized that osteoblasts might be a source of androgen synthesis. RNA expression analyses of murine osteoblasts and human bone confirmed that at least one 3βHSD and 17βHSD enzyme isoform was expressed, suggesting that osteoblasts are capable of generating androgens from adrenal DHEA. Murine osteoblasts were treated with 100 nM and 1 μM DHEA or vehicle control. Conditioned media from these osteoblasts were assayed for intermediate and active androgens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. As DHEA was consumed, the androgen intermediates androstenediol and androstenedione were generated and subsequently converted to T. Conditioned media of DHEA-treated osteoblasts increased androgen receptor (AR) signaling, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production, and cell numbers of the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines C4-2B and LNCaP. DHEA did not induce AR signaling in osteoblasts despite AR expression in this cell type. We describe an unreported function of osteoblasts as a source of T that is especially relevant during androgen-responsive metastatic prostate cancer invasion into bone. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

      "abstract": "Prophylactic antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV infected pregnant mothers and their newborns can dramatically reduce mother-to-child viral transmission and seroconversion in the neonate. The ritonavir-boosted lopinavir regimen, known as Kaletra, has been associated with premature birth and transient adrenal insufficiency in newborns, accompanied by increases in plasma dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate (DHEA-S). In the fetus and neonates, cytochrome P450 CYP3A7 is responsible for the metabolism of DHEA-S into 16α-hydroxy DHEA-S, which plays a critical role in growth and development. In order to determine if CYP3A7 inhibition could lead to the adverse outcomes associated with Kaletra therapy, we conducted in vitro metabolic studies to determine the extent and mechanism of CYP3A7 inhibition by both ritonavir and lopinavir and the relative intrinsic clearance of lopinavir with and without ritonavir in both neonatal and adult human liver microsomes (HLMs). We identified ritonavir as a potent inhibitor of CYP3A7 oxidation of DHEA-S (IC50 = 0.0514 μM), while lopinavir is a much weaker inhibitor (IC50 = 5.88 μM). Furthermore, ritonavir is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A7 with a KI of 0.392 μM and a kinact of 0.119 min-1, illustrating the potential for CYP3A mediated drug-drug interactions with Kaletra. The clearance rate of lopinavir in neonatal HLMs was much slower and comparable to the rate observed in adult HLMs in the presence of ritonavir, suggesting that the addition of ritonavir in the cocktail therapy may not be necessary to maintain effective concentrations of lopinavir in neonates. Our results suggest that several of the observed adverse outcomes of Kaletra therapy may be due to the direct inhibition of CYP3A7 by ritonavir and that the necessity for the inclusion of this drug in the therapy may be obviated by the lower rate of lopinavir clearance in the neonatal liver. These results may lead to a reconsideration of the use of ritonavir in neonatal antiretroviral therapy.",

Paeoniflorin (PAE) plays a significant anti-fibrotic role according to previous studies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of PAE on ovarian fibrosis and its underlying mechanism in PCOS development. An animal model of PCOS was established by subcutaneous injection of 60mg/kg/d dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for 35 consecutive days. Rats in PAE-L, PAE-M and PAE-H groups were administrated by gavage with PAE (20, 40, 80 mg/kg/d) for 4 weeks. Our results indicated that DHEA-induced PCOS rats showed similar phenotypes with PCOS patients. PAE could significantly block the DHEA-induced decline of ovary weight and organ coefficient, shorten the prolonged diestrus period, and regulate the irregular estrous cycle of PCOS rats. Moreover, PAE regulated reproductive hormone levels and improved ovarian fibrosis induced by DHEA. PAE treatment could also reduce the expression levels of TGF-β1 and Smad3, and increase the expression levels of Smad7 and MMP2. In conclusion, PAE significantly attenuated the ovarian fibrosis in PCOS, which could be mediated by TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway. Herein, PAE can be used for the treatment of ovarian fibrosis in PCOS progression.",

After menopause, insufficient sex hormones affect the anatomy of the vagina and cause drastic physiological changes. The main histopathological studies of VVA show that postmenopausal estrogen deficiency can lead to the increase of intermediate/parabasal cells, resulting in the loss of lactobacillus, elasticity and lubricity, vaginal epithelial atrophy, pain, dryness. Although the role of estrogen hormones in the treatment of VVA has always been in the past, it is now widely accepted that it also depends on androgens. Estrogen drugs have many side effects. So, Dehydroepiandrosterone（DHEA）is promising for the treatment of VVA, especially when women with contraindications to estrogen have symptoms. This review is expected to understand the latest developments in VVA and the efficacy of DHEA.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 32 male rats were divided equally into four groups (n = 8): (i) control group (C), (ii) control treated with DHEA (Control + DHEA), (iii) orchidectomized (ORCH) group that underwent bilateral orchidectomy and (iv) orchidectomized (ORCH) rats treated with DHEA (ORCH+DHEA). DHEA treatment started 4 weeks after orchidectomy and continued for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) were assayed in the tibia and femur of the right hind limb of each rat. We also measured the serum levels of the bone turnover markers deoxypyridinoline (Dpd), N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP-5b) and osteocalcin (OC) as well as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). RESULTS: Orchidectomy in rats caused significant reduction in BMD, BMC, serum levels of testosterone, PTH (parathyroid hormone), OPG, OC and ALP with significant rise in serum levels of TRAP-5B, RANK, Dpd and NTx1 (p < 0.05). On the other hand, DHEA therapy for 12 weeks caused significant improvement in all studied parameters except NTx1 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DHEA corrected hypogonadism-induced osteoporosis in male rats probably via inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, stimulating the activity of osteoblasts and stimulating the secretion of PTH and testosterone."

Thus, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCT) which assessed the effects of DHEA supplementation on FPG, IN and the HOMA-IR index in humans. METHODS: An extensive search was performed in Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Web of Science from inception to June 2020. Data was combined using the random effects model. RESULTS: 14 publications were included in this study. Overall results demonstrated that FPG was significantly altered after DHEA consumption (WMD: -2.185 mg/dl, P = 0.029). DHEA administration did not result in any significant changes in IN (WMD: 0.057 μU/mL, P = 0.067), and the HOMA - IR index (WMD: 0.174, P = 0.060). In the subgroup analyses, FPG significantly decreased in the subgroup who received DHEA supplementation in dosages of ≤50 mg/day (WMD: -2.29 mg/dl), when the treatment duration was <12 weeks (WMD: -5.25 mg/dl), and in subjects aged ≥60 years (WMD: -2.94 mg/dl). CONCLUSION: This systematic review evaluated the association between FPG and DHEA, revealing that the administration of DHEA reduces FPG levels. However, we found no association between DHEA administration and IN levels or insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been aggressively sold as a dietary supplement to boost testosterone levels although the impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone levels has not been fully established. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to investigate the effect of oral DHEA supplementation on testosterone levels. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed databases up to February 2020 for RCTs that investigated the effect of DHEA supplementation on testosterone levels. The estimated effect of the data was calculated using the weighted mean difference (WMD). Subgroup analysis was performed to identify the source of heterogeneity among studies. RESULTS: Overall results from 42 publications (comprising 55 arms) demonstrated that testosterone level was significantly increased after DHEA administration (WMD: 28.02 ng/dl, 95% CI: 21.44-34.60, p = 0.00). Subgroup analyses revealed that DHEA increased testosterone level in all subgroups, but the magnitude of increment was higher in females compared to men (WMD: 30.98 ng/dl vs. 21.36 ng/dl); DHEA dosage of ˃50 mg/d compared to ≤50 mg/d (WMD: 57.96 ng/dl vs. 19.43 ng/dl); intervention duration of ≤12 weeks compared to ˃12 weeks (WMD: 44.64 ng/dl vs. 19 ng/dl); healthy participants compared to postmenopausal women, pregnant women, non-healthy participants and androgen-deficient patients (WMD: 52.17 ng/dl vs. 25.04 ng/dl, 16.44 ng/dl and 16.47 ng/dl); and participants below 60 years old compared to above 60 years old (WMD: 31.42 ng/dl vs. 23.93 ng/dl). CONCLUSION: DHEA supplementation is effective for increasing testosterone levels, although the magnitude varies among different subgroups. More study needed on pregnant women and miscarriage.",

The effectiveness of DHEA in the premenopausal women remains unclear, while in postmenopausal women with coexisting estrogens deficiency is controversial. Despite many years of study, the use of DHEA is still controversial, especially regarding its effectiveness. The aim of present article was to evaluate DHEA specific effects on metabolic parameters, bone mineral density, insulin resistance as well as the therapeutic potential of DHEA in pre- and postmenopausal women using measures of sexual activity, cognition and well-being. The summary of this article is the position statement of expert group of the Polish Menopause and Andropause Society regarding the efficacy and safety of DHEA supplementation in women. We concluded, that currently available clinical trials and meta-analyses indicate that DHEA supplementation is effective in women with adrenal insufficiency and chronically treated with exogenous glucocorticoids, postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density and/or osteoporosis, premenopausal women with sexual disorders and low libido, and in women with vulvovaginal atrophy due to menopause or genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Currently available clinical trials also suggest that DHEA supplementation is probably effective in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual disorders, infertile women with diminished ovarian reserve, women suffering from depression and anxiety, and women with obesity and insulin resistance. No serious adverse effects have been reported.",

      "abstract": "The cortisol response in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during exposure with response prevention (ERP), a stressful but very effective psychotherapeutic treatment, has shown contradictory findings in three prior studies with low sample sizes. In a larger cohort of 51 patients with OCD we repeatedly measured subjective units of distress (SUD) and the adrenocortical stress hormones cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) in saliva during the very first session of ERP and on the day before. Expectedly, SUD were increased on the ERP day before the session and further rose during ERP, but salivary cortisol and DHEA were statistically indistinguishable from the comparison condition. Interestingly, DHEA-S was significantly elevated throughout the ERP versus the comparison day, but did not further increase in acute response to ERP. According to an explorative analysis in a subsample, hormone levels on the comparison or the ERP day did not predict anti-OCD treatment response one month later. These results corroborate our prior findings of cortisol non-response despite considerable subjective stress in ERP. The role of DHEA-S in anticipatory anxiety and the effects of augmentative cortisol therapy in ERP need further study.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) continues to be one of the most complex reproductive and endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age. Recent reports have identified close interaction of Vitamin D deficiency and oxidative stress (OS) in exacerbating the pathophysiology of PCOS. This current study aims at assessing the combine effect of MitoQ10 and Vitamin D3 on dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) induced PCOS. Following successful induction of PCOS using DHEA, mice were organized into five groups (n = 8) namely: Negative Control (NC), Vitamin D3 Vehicle (VDV), Vitamin D3 (VD), MitoQ10 (MQ), Vitamin D3 plus MitoQ10 (V+M) and DHEA, ethanol and distilled water, Vitamin D3, MitoQ10 and Vitamin D3 plus MitoQ10 were respectively administered for 20 consecutive days. The study also included positive control (PC) group (n = 8) in which no treatment was applied. Treatment effects were assessed using hormonal assays, biochemical assays, Real-Time PCR, western blotting and histological analysis. Combination of Vitamin D3 and MitoQ10 significantly reduced levels of estradiol, progesterone, FSH, LH, LH/FSH, SOD and MDA. The expression rate of mRNAs of 3β-HSD, Cyp19a1, Cyp11a1, StAR, Keap1, HO-1 and Nrf2 were also significantly low in V+M group. Moreover, the histomorphological inspection of ovaries from this group revealed many healthy follicles at various stages of development including few atretic follicles, pre-antral and antral follicles and many corpora lutea. The characteristics observed in this group were in many ways similar to that of the PC group. The combination of MitoQ10 and Vitamin D3 may be potential candidate to ameliorate PCOS."

Serum hormones are being studied for the skeletal age assessment to avoid unnecessary radiographic exposure. The present study is to evaluate the relationship of serum hormones dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and cervical vertebral stages (CS stages) in the skeletal age assessment of orthodontics patients around the circumpubertal age. METHODS: A total of ninety subjects with age ranging from 7 to 21 years were selected and divided into two groups based on the sex (45 males, 45 females). They were further distributed in each group based on the six CS stages determined from the lateral cephalogram. Blood samples from each subject were collected to evaluate the serum DHEA-S and IGF-1 levels by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Collected data were analyzed in SPSS software with a test of normalcy, unpaired t test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the least significant difference (LSD) post hoc comparison test and univariate regression analysis. RESULTS: The highest mean serum hormone levels were found in CS 4 in group A (male) and CS 3 in group B (female). ANOVA results showed that there was a significant difference in the serum hormone levels among the different CS stages in both the groups for both the hormones. Statistically, a significant difference was found between each CS stages for both the hormones except in the DHEA-S levels between CS 5 and CS 6. CONCLUSIONS: The mean serum DHEA-S levels followed a typical pattern from the CS 1 till CS 6 which was comparable and similar to the mean serum IGF-1 levels in respect to CS stages. Thus, serum DHEA-S levels could be used as a possible diagnostic test for the assessment of the skeletal pubertal growth spurt in dentofacial orthopedics.",

      "abstract": "The inflammatory responses associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may play a significant role in the severity of the disease. Emerging evidence report states that the polyunsaturated fatty acids are capable of ameliorating the PCOS condition. The therapeutic effects of γ-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid, in various inflammatory diseases have been reported. Yet, its role in PCOS associated inflammatory response remains unexplored. The aim of the study was to decipher the effects of GLA in PCOS and its role in the PPAR-γ pathway. In our study, female Wistar rats were stimulated with daily subcutaneous injections of DHEA (60 mg/kg per day) for 28 days to induce PCOS. Daily doses of GLA(10, 20, and 50 mg/kg) and Pioglitazone (P)(30 mg/kg) were administered orally for 14 days after PCOS induction. The levels of DHEA, leptin, PPAR-γ were measured by ELISA. The gene expression levels of leptin, TNF-α, IL-33, PPAR-γ, C/EBP-β, SREBP-1were determined by Real Time-PCR. We observed that the GLA significantly attenuated the DHEA and leptin levels. GLA treatment also upregulated PPAR-γ expression, when compared to the DHEA group. Further, GLA treatment showed a significant reduction in DHEA induced TNF-α, IL-33, C/EBP-β, and SREBP-1 levels in Wistar rat polycystic ovary tissue samples. The present findings could indicate that GLA is able to reduce the inflammatory response due to DHEA stimulation and thereafter potentially attenuate PCOS via the PPAR-γ pathway.",

The inconsistencies could be attributed to several factors, such as dosage, gender, and duration of intervention, among others. To address these inconsistencies, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to combine findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this topic. METHODS: Electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Embase and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant literature published up to February 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-four qualified trials were included in this meta-analysis. It was found that serum IGF-1 levels were significantly increased in the DHEA group compared to the control (weighted mean differences (WMD): 16.36 ng/ml, 95% CI: 8.99, 23.74; p = .000). Subgroup analysis revealed that a statistically significant increase in serum IGF-1 levels was found only in women (WMD: 23.30 ng/ml, 95% CI: 13.75, 32.87); in participants who supplemented 50 mg/d DHEA (WMD: 15.75 ng/ml, 95% CI: 7.61, 23.89); in participants undergoing DHEA intervention for >12 weeks (WMD: 17.2 ng/ml, 95% CI: 8.02, 26.22); in participants without an underlying comorbidity (WMD: 19.11 ng/ml, 95% CI: 10.69, 27.53); and in participants over the age of 60 years (WMD: 19.79 ng/ml, 95% CI: 9.86, 29.72). CONCLUSION: DHEA supplementation may increase serum IGF-I levels especially in women and older subjects. However, further studies are warranted before DHEA can be recommended for clinical use.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the article was to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on the involvement of DHEA and DHEAS in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched for relevant literature. The articles were selected considering their titles and abstracts. In the selected full texts, lists of references were searched manually for additional articles. RESULTS: We performed a systematic review of the studies investigating the role of DHEA and DHEAS in various in vitro and animal models, as well as in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and provided a comprehensive discussion on their potential preventive and therapeutic applications. CONCLUSION: Despite mixed results, the findings of various preclinical studies are generally supportive of the involvement of DHEA and DHEAS in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, showing some promise for potential benefits of these neurosteroids in the prevention and treatment. However, so far small clinical trials brought little evidence to support their therapy in AD. Therefore, large-scale human studies are needed to elucidate the specific effects of DHEA and DHEAS and their mechanisms of action, prior to their applications in clinical practice.",

Meta-analysis showed that Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) administration resulted in a significant increase in the number of oocytes retrieved in women with POR. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of DHEA supplementation on IVF outcomes among poor responders undergoing IVF. METHODS: Sixteen patients who were diagnosed with POR scheduled to undergo their second cycle of Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)/embryo transfer cycle were enrolled. All enrolled patients had earlier undergone their first ICSI/embryo transfer cycle at least four months prior to this study. All subjects were given DHEA supplementation of 25mg three times daily for at least three months prior to their second ICSI/embryo transfer cycle. Statistical analysis of various ovarian response and ICSI outcomes parameter were compared pre and post DHEA. RESULTS: Sixteen women with the mean age of 35 years were enrolled in the study. The comparative analysis of results showed a significant increase in the number of good quality of embryos obtained (p<0.05). After the treatment with DHEA, there was an improvement in the number of oocytes retrieved, Metaphase II (MII) oocyte (mature) oocytes obtained, fertilised and transferrable embryos and the pregnancy rate. There was no significant effect of DHEA treatment on the number of days of stimulation and cumulative dose of gonadotrophins used. CONCLUSION: Our results is able to show that DHEA supplementation may help to enhance IVF-ICSI outcomes in women with POR especially in those age 35 years and below.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), affecting approximately one third of the world's population. Development of an adequate immune response will determine disease progression or progress to chronic infection. Risk of developing TB among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected patients (HIV-TB) is 20-30 times higher than those without HIV infection, and a synergistic interplay between these two pathogens accelerates the decline in immunological functions. TB treatment in HIV-TB coinfected persons is challenging and it has a prolonged duration, mainly due to the immune system failure to provide an adequate support for the therapy. Therefore, we aimed to study the role of the hormone 7-oxo-dehydroepiandrosterone (7-OD) as a modulator of anti-tuberculosis immune responses in the context of HIV-TB coinfection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-TB patients and healthy donors (HD). We characterized the ex vivo phenotype of CD4 + T cells and also evaluated in vitro antigen-specific responses by Mtb stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence or absence of 7-OD. We assessed lymphoproliferative activity, cytokine production and master transcription factor profiles. RESULTS: Our results show that HIV-TB patients were not able to generate successful anti-tubercular responses in vitro compared to HD, as reduced IFN-γ/IL-10 and IFN-γ/IL-17A ratios were observed. Interestingly, treatment with 7-OD enhanced Th1 responses by increasing Mtb-induced proliferation and the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α over IL-10 levels. Additionally, in vitro Mtb stimulation augmented the frequency of cells with a regulatory phenotype, while 7-OD reduced the proportion of these subsets and induced an increase in CD4 + T-bet+ (Th1) subpopulation, which is associated with clinical data linked to an improved disease outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 7-OD modifies the cytokine balance and the phenotype of CD4 + T cells towards a more favorable profile for mycobacteria control. These results provide new data to delineate novel treatment approaches as co-adjuvant for the treatment of TB.",

Chronic inflammation is considered to be the cause of ovarian dysfunction. Increasing evidence in animal studies and in preliminary clinical trials has demonstrated that MSCs possess immunomodulatory effects via their interaction with immune cells. However, their contribution to PCOS remains unclear. In this study, we showed that the administration of hUC-MSCs could efficiently improve the pathological changes of PCOS mice induced by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), including ovarian histopathology and function. Moreover, we found that the administration of MSCs significantly downregulated the expression of proinflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ) and fibrosis-related genes (CTGF) in ovarian and uterus tissues and affected the systemic inflammatory response. The percentage of peripheral neutrophils, M1 macrophages, and B cells was significantly reduced, while M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells (Tregs) were increased in hUC-MSC-treated mice. In the spleen, the percentage of neutrophils, M1 macrophages, IFN-γ +CD19+B cell, IFN-γ +CD4+T cells (Th1), and IL-17+CD4+T cells (Th17) was significantly decreased in hUC-MSC-treated mice. These results suggested that hUC-MSC treatment could alleviate ovarian dysfunction by inhibiting ovarian local and systemic inflammatory responses."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of statins on serum or plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in women with PCOS. <strong>MATERIAL AND METHODS</strong> Databases that were searched included PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from their inception to August of 2018. Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that evaluated the impact of statins on plasma DHEA levels in women with PCOS. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the included RCTs. A random-effects model was used to analyze the pooled results. <strong>RESULTS</strong> Meta-analysis was performed on data from ten published studies that included 735 patients and showed that statin treatment could significantly reduce plasma DHEA levels when compared with controls (SMD, -0.43; 95% CI, -0.81-0.06; p=0.02; I²=82%). Statins were significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the levels of DHEAs. Subgroup analysis based on statin type showed that atorvastatin significantly reduced DHEA levels (SMD, -0.63; 95% CI, -1.20 - -0.05; p=0.03; I²=38%) but simvastatin did not significantly reduce DHEA levels (SMD: -0.14; 95% CI, -0.49-0.28; p=0.43; I²=77%). Subgroup analysis based on duration of treatment showed no significant difference between 12 weeks of statin treatment (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.23-0.02; p=0.06; I²=85%) and 24 weeks (SMD, -0.34; 95% CI -0.95-0.28; p=0.29; I²=83%). <strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong> Meta-analysis showed that statins significantly reduced the levels of DHEA when compared with placebo in patients with PCOS.",

In previous data, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was suggested as a promising treatment and maybe has a good pregnancy outcome. But there is no sufficient evidence from randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of DHEA preconceptional treatment on live birth in POR. METHODS: This trial is a multicenter active-placebo double-blind clinical trial (1:1 treatment ratio of active versus placebo). The infertile POR patients undergoing IVF or ICSI will be enrolled and randomly assigned to two parallel groups. Participants in these two groups will be given 4-12 weeks' treatment of DHEA or placebo, respectively. The primary outcome is live birth rate. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide evidence for the effect of preconceptional DHEA treatment on IVF outcome in POR.

The pathologic finding of this restrictive lung condition is excessive deposition of fibrotic tissue in the alveolar interstitium. Conventional therapies minimally alter the course of disease, and mean survival time from diagnosis is only 2 to 4 years. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man, diagnosed with IPF in 2007, was being monitored by a conventional pulmonologist while being treated with weekly acupuncture targeting a Chinese medicine diagnosis of spleen dampness and lung qi weakness and with botanical medicine targeting the stimulation of adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone secretion. He survived for 10 years after diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Studies exist linking dehydroepiandrosterone with IPF disease activity as well as acupuncture with antifibrotic activity. Larger clinical studies are needed to substantiate the link between acupuncture and/or dehydroepiandrosterone-stimulating herbs for the treatment of IPF.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Studies of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) therapy in older adults suggest sex-specific effects on bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition, but the ability of a single study to reach this conclusion was limited. We evaluated the effects of DHEA on sex hormones, BMD, fat mass and fat-free mass in older women and men enrolled in four similar clinical trials. DESIGN: Pooled analyses of data from four double-blinded, randomized controlled trials. PARTICIPANTS: Women (n = 295) and men (n = 290) aged 55 years or older who took DHEA or placebo tablet daily for 12 months. MEASUREMENTS: Twelve-month changes in BMD, fat mass, fat-free mass and serum DHEA sulphate (DHEAS), (17)estradiol, testosterone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). RESULTS: Women on DHEA had increases (mean ± SD; all P < 0.001 vs placebo) in DHEAS (231 ± 164 µg/dL), testosterone (18.6 ± 20.9 µg/dL), (17)estradiol (8.7 ± 11.0 pg/mL) and IGF-1 (25.1 ± 52.3 ng/mL), and men had increases in DHEAS (269.0 ± 177 µg/dL; P < 0.01), (17)estradiol (4.8 ± 12.2 pg/m; P < 0.01) and IGF-1 (6.3 ± 41.4 ng/mL; P < 0.05). Women on DHEA had increases in lumbar spine (1.0% ± 3.4%) and trochanter (0.5% ± 3.8%) BMD and maintained total hip BMD (0.0% ± 2.8%); men had no BMD benefit and a decrease in fat mass (-0.4 ± 2.6 kg; all P < 0.01 vs placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Dehydroepiandrosterone therapy may be an effective approach for preserving bone and muscle mass in women. Key questions are (a) the extent to which longer duration DHEA can attenuate the loss of bone and muscle in women, and (b) whether DHEA has a more favourable benefit-to-risk profile for women than oestrogen therapy.",

METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial, the effect of daily intravaginal 0.50% DHEA (6.5 mg) (Prasterone, EndoCeutics) was examined on four coprimary objectives, namely percentage of parabasal cells, percentage or superficial cells, vaginal pH, and moderate to severe pain at sexual activity (dyspareunia) identified by the women as their most bothersome vulvovaginal atrophy symptom. The intent-to-treat population included 157 and 325 women in the placebo and DHEA-treated groups, respectively. RESULTS: After daily intravaginal administration of 0.50% DHEA for 12 weeks, when compared to baseline by the analysis of covariance test, the percentage of parabasal cells decreased by 27.7% over placebo (P < 0.0001), whereas the percentage of superficial cells increased by 8.44% over placebo (P < 0.0001), vaginal pH decreased by 0.66 pH unit over placebo (P < 0.0001), and pain at sexual activity decreased by 1.42 severity score unit from baseline or 0.36 unit over placebo (P = 0.0002). On the other hand, moderate to severe vaginal dryness present in 84.0% of women improved at 12 weeks by 1.44 severity score unit compared to baseline, or 0.27 unit over placebo (P = 0.004). At gynecological evaluation, vaginal secretions, epithelial integrity, epithelial surface thickness, and color all improved by 86% to 121% over the placebo effect (P < 0.0001 for all comparisons with placebo). Serum steroid levels remained well within the normal postmenopausal values according to the involved mechanisms of intracrinology. The only side effect reasonably related to treatment is vaginal discharge due to melting of the vehicle at body temperature and this was reported in about 6% of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: The daily intravaginal administration of 0.50% (6.5 mg) DHEA (Prasterone) has shown clinically and highly statistically significant effects on the four coprimary parameters suggested by the US Food and Drug Administration. The strictly local action of Prasterone is in line with the absence of significant drug-related adverse events, thus showing the high benefit-to-risk ratio of this treatment based upon the novel understanding of the physiology of sex steroids in women.",

      "abstract": "The impact of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) administration has been widely studied for anti-doping purposes in men, whereas only a few studies have been performed in women. In the present study, the impact of DHEA on the steroid profile parameters and their carbon isotopic ratios was explored. Eleven healthy young women and 10 healthy young men received two treatments: One with 100 mg/day of DHEA for 28 days and one with a placebo according to a double-blind crossover protocol. Urine and saliva (only in females) samples were collected before and for 72 hours after each short-term treatment. In all female subjects, concentrations of the urinary parameters of the steroid profile were highly impacted by short-term DHEA administration including epitestosterone (E). Gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) analysis was performed and positive results were observed for E in the four female subjects where E concentration was adequate for such analysis, whereas men results remained negative for E. Last, the ability of the Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) software used for the athlete biological passport to identify such doping was assessed. Of the 11 passports generated for female subjects, 10 were automatically classified as an atypical passport finding (ATPF). For the remaining passport with normal status in one woman, the variability of the concentrations prevented the ADAMS software from adjusting individual limits. The most impacted markers in women were T/E and 5αAdiol/E, with a detection window of 36 hours for 5αAdiol/E. In addition, good correlations were observed for DHEA and T concentrations in urine and saliva in females.",

However, its impact on these parameters has never been investigated in a young healthy population. This study therefore sought to determine whether short-term DHEA administration would alter food intake, segmental body composition, adipokine secretion and mood in young healthy male and female volunteers with regular sport practice. METHODS: Following a double-blind and randomized protocol, 20 young healthy recreational athletes (10 men and 10 women) received treatment with either oral placebo or DHEA (100 mg/day for 4 weeks). Body weight, segmental body composition and adipokines (i.e., leptin, adiponectin and resistin) were determined before and at the end of each treatment. In parallel, spontaneous food intake was assessed at the end of each treatment, and mood was assessed before and at the end of treatment with the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS). RESULTS: Body weight and segmental body composition showed no significant change in the men or women. Similarly, no change in adipokine secretion was found after DHEA administration. Total food intake was not affected by DHEA in any subject, despite an increase in fat intake by male subjects under DHEA (P<0.05). Positive and negative affect were not altered. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in contrast to pathological populations, a young healthy population of men and women was not significantly affected by short-term DHEA administration with regard to total food intake, segmental body composition, adipokines or mood.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There is uncertainty whether treatment with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) decreases menopausal symptoms for women in the peri- or postmenopausal phase. A previous systematic review considering this subject suggested that DHEA may slightly improve sexual function compared with placebo (CS. Scheffers, S. Armstrong, AEP. Cantineau, C. Farquhar, V. Jordan Dehydroepiandrosterone for women in the peri- or postmenopausal phase. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2015, Issue 1. Art. No.: CD011066. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011066.pub2). The purpose of this article is to review recent research investigating whether the use of DHEA, and in particular intravaginal DHEA (Prasterone®), improves sexual function. METHODS: We conducted an online search using Medline OVID for recent articles related to DHEA and menopause. We found 48 relevant publications, out of which 14 papers were original research, all related to the development and licensing of intravaginal DHEA. We critically analysed these 14 articles in relation to sexual function. RESULTS: All the randomised controlled trials assessed the efficacy of vaginal DHEA in women with vulvovaginal atrophy and showed that sexual dysfunction improved with treatment regardless of the level of dyspareunia at baseline. Treatment with DHEA was found to be superior to placebo and at least as efficacious as vaginal oestrogens in improving symptoms. CONCLUSION: Intravaginal DHEA appears to be a safe and effective treatment for menopausal vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia in most women. Further studies are required before it can be recommended for women with a history of thrombosis, cardiovascular disease or hormone-sensitive neoplasms.",

The purpose of this double-blind, randomized study was therefore to investigate the effects of short-term DHEA administration (100 mg/day/4 weeks) on neuroendocrine (i.e., beta-endorphin and prolactin) and inflammatory (i.e., interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha) parameters in 10 young healthy female volunteers with regular sports practice. In parallel, the stress state was assessed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. DHEA administration did not alter prolactin, interleukin-6 or TNF-alpha, and no significant change in tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue or confusion was noted. However, beta-endorphin levels increased significantly (p < 0.05) with the DHEA treatment. The results of this investigation indicate that short-term DHEA administration improves neuroendocrine modulation but does not affect the inflammatory status or psychological state in recreationally trained female athletes. Further studies are needed to determine the exact mechanisms and the responses of these parameters to DHEA administration at higher dosages and/or for longer durations, especially in response to physical/psychological stress.",

      "abstract": "The secretion of estrogens by the ovaries stops at menopause. Afterward, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) becomes the only source of both estrogens and androgens during all the postmenopausal years. To maintain very low and biologically inactive concentrations of estrogens and androgens in the circulation, DHEA is transformed intracellularly into cell-specific small amounts of estrogens and androgens (except in the endometrium) which then act and are inactivated locally in the same cells, thus avoiding biologically significant systemic exposure to active sex steroids. The secretion of DHEA, however, mainly of adrenal origin, has already decreased by an average of 60% at the time of menopause and it continues to decrease thereafter with a parallel lowering in available intracellular estrogens and androgens. Consequently, after the arrest of estrogen secretion by the ovaries, the loss of DHEA becomes practically responsible for the symptoms and signs of menopause. Replacing what is missing, namely DHEA, at the right place, at the right time, and in the right amount, seems to be the logical and physiological approach for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and signs, as recently demonstrated for pain at sexual activity (dyspareunia), the most bothersome symptom of vulvovaginal atrophy due to menopause.",

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether chronic DHEA administration impacts on redox status and on Akt protein activation in skeletal muscle during the aging process (3 and 24 months-old rats). METHODS: Rats received one weekly dose/5 weeks of DHEA (10 mg/kg) or vehicle. Gastrocnemius muscle was removed to evaluate glutathione system, hydrogen peroxide, antioxidant enzymes, and expression of Akt kinase protein. RESULTS: In the 3-months-old rats DHEA induced an increase in hydrogen peroxide when compared both to its control (276%) and the 24-months-old DHEA group (485%). Moreover, in the 24- months-old rats DHEA caused an increase in GSSG (41 and 28%), a decrease in reduced-GSH (55 and 51%), and a more oxidized redox status (reduction in GSH/GSSG ratio, 47 and 65 %) when compared to 3-month-old DHEA and to 24-months-old control groups, respectively. Both older groups had increased G6PDH (2.7 fold) and GST (1.7 fold) activities when compared to younger groups, independently of any DHEA treatment. However, there was no modulation of Akt protein (phosphorylated/total isoform). CONCLUSION: The results show that chronic DHEA administration to 3 and 24-months-old rats may not present positive effects regarding the redox environment in skeletal muscle without modulation of pro-survival Akt kinase. Due to the large-scale self-administration of DHEA as an \"anti-aging\" dietary supplement, it is crucial to investigate its molecular mechanisms over oxidative stressinduced related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Steroid hormones form an integral part of normal development in mammalian organisms. Cholesterol is the parent compound from which all steroid hormones are synthesized. The product pregnenolone formed from cholesterol serves as precursor for mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its derived sexual hormones. DHEA assumes the prohormone status of a predominant endogenous precursor and a metabolic intermediate in ovarian follicular steroidogenesis. DHEA supplementation has been used to enhance ovarian reserve. Steroids like estradiol and testosterone have long been contemplated to play important roles in regulating meiotic maturation of oocytes in conjunction with gonadotropins. It is known that oocyte priming with estrogen is necessary to develop calcium (Ca2+) oscillations during maturation. Accruing evidence from diverse studies suggests that DHEA and its sulfate (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, DHEA-S) play significantly vital role not only as intermediates in androgen and estrogen formation, but may also be the probable 'oocyte factor' and behave as endogenous agonists triggering calcium oscillations for oocyte activation. DHEA/DHEA-S have been reported to regulate calcium channels for the passage of Ca2+ through the oocyte cytoplasm and for maintaining required threshold of Ca2+ oscillations. This role of DHEA/DHEA-S assumes critical significance in assisted reproductive technology and in-vitro fertilization treatment cycles where physical, chemical, and mechanical methods are employed for artificial oocyte activation to enhance fertilization rates. However, since these methods are invasive and may also cause adverse epigenetic modifications; oral or culture-media supplementation with DHEA/DHEA-S provides a noninvasive innate mechanism of in-vitro oocyte activation based on physiological metabolic pathway.",

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) represents a new pharmacological agent with vascular effects, including improvement of PPHN in several animal models. We hypothesized that DHEA could decrease pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in the pulmonary circulation of fetal sheep. We studied the effect of intravenous infusion of DHEA in fetal lambs using chronically instrumented sheep at 128 days of gestation. PVR was computed before and after intravenous infusion of increasing doses of DHEA. We assessed pre-treatment by L-nitroarginine, an inhibitor of NO production. Blood gases and doses of DHEA were measured in both sheep and fetus before/after DHEA infusion. Intravenous infusion of DHEA had a vasodilator effect with a significant decrease in PVR (respectively -11%, -14% and -36% after infusion of 6, 12 and 24 mg DHEA, p<0.01) without damaging effects on systemic circulation or on blood gases. The inhibitory effect of pre-treatment with L-nitroarginine resulted in a significant increase in PVR. We demonstrated a potent vasodilator effect of DHEA on fetal pulmonary circulation without deleterious effects. DHEA might represent a new treatment for PPHN.",

Neurosteroids are important neuroactive molecules with demonstrated involvement in several neurophysiological and disease processes. Previous research has noted neurosteroid changes in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels following exercise. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether changes in DHEA levels are associated with mood improvement after exercise and whether there are any differences in the effects on younger and older individuals. METHODS: Individuals ≤ 50 years of age or > 65 years of age were recruited for study participation. Before and after 30 minutes of a standardized cycling regimen, each patient provided a blood sample and completed a questionnaire on mood and well-being. RESULTS: Findings confirmed a significant increase in DHEA levels post-exercise. A decrease in negative factors (fatigue, tension, depression, anger) and an increase in positive mood factors were noted. No difference in change of measures was noted between younger and older subjects. A positive correlation was noted between mood change and DHEA blood-level changes in older subjects. Among older males, DHEA appeared to be associated with mood change after exercise. CONCLUSIONS: While preliminary, findings indicate a possible association between mood improvement following exercise and DHEA blood level changes. Understanding the biological mechanisms of exercise-induced mood changes is critical to utilizing exercise as a treatment for mood disorders.",

This article builds on these results and intends to explore a dimension that has received less attention: the incarnation of medical promises. Looking at the evolving case of a particular molecule, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-which has been promoted from the mid-1990s onwards as a \"fountain of youth\" pill-, we emphasize that testimonies by and portrayals of those who are undergoing a treatment with uncertain risks and benefits, and representations of their bodies in the media, can play a key role in the performativity of a medical promise. We analyze this incarnation as a specific \"form of veridiction\" and stress its normative dimension.

MAIN METHODS: The reproductive function was studied by monitoring the estrous cycle and hormones. The ovarian reserve was studied by testing the anti-mullerian hormone and ovarian histology. The follicular development was studied histologically and immunohistochemically. KEY FINDINGS: DHEA supplementation at a dose of at 50 mg/kg improved the ovarian reserve and pregnancy outcomes. Higher doses of DHEA caused PCOs-like symptoms manifested by the development of cystic follicles and low ovarian reserve and pregnancy outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: DHEA is a promising treatment that improves the ovarian reserve parameters and pregnancy outcomes. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration.",

Growth hormone (GH) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation were assessed in women undergoing fresh IVF transfer cycles and categorized as poor prognosis from five criteria. METHODS: Data were retrospectively analyzed from 626 women undergoing 626 IVF cycles, where they received no adjuvant, GH alone, or GH-DHEA in combination. A small group received DHEA alone. The utilization of adjuvants was decided between the attending clinician and the patient depending on various factors including cost. RESULTS: Despite patients being significantly older with lower ovarian reserve, live birth rates were significantly greater with GH alone (18.6%) and with GH-DHEA (13.0%) in comparison to those with no adjuvant (p < 0.003). No significant difference was observed between the GH groups (p = 0.181). Overall, patient age, quality of the transferred embryo, and GH treatment were the only significant independent predictors of live birth chance. Following adjustment for patient age, antral follicle count, and quality of transferred embryo, GH alone and GH-DHEA led to a 7.1-fold and 5.6-fold increase in live birth chance, respectively (p < 0.000). CONCLUSION: These data indicated that GH adjuvant may support more live births, particularly in younger women, and importantly, the positive effects of GH treatment were still observed even if DHEA was also used in combination. However, supplementation with DHEA did not indicate any potentiating benefit or modify the effects of GH treatment. Due to the retrospective design, and the risk of a selection bias, caution is advised in the interpretation of the data."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) figures on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances in sport because it is assumed that athletes expect a significant increase in testosterone through DHEA administration. The literature on the hormonal effects of DHEA intake nevertheless appears to be very scant in healthy young subjects, especially women. PURPOSE: We examined the effects of DHEA on adrenal and gonadal hormones, IGF1 and free T3 in healthy young male and female recreationally trained volunteers. METHODS: The study followed a double-blind, randomized-order crossover design. Lean healthy young men (n = 10) and women (n = 11), with all women using oral contraceptives, were treated daily with 100 mg of DHEA and placebo for 4 weeks. DHEA, DHEA-sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione, total testosterone (Tes), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), SHBG, estrone, cortisol, IGF1, and free T3 were measured before, in the middle and at the end of each treatment, as were blood glucose, liver transaminases and lipid status. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in DHEA, DHEA-S, androstenedione, Tes, DHT, and estrone in both men and women in the middle and at the end of DHEA treatment, but the increase in Tes was more marked in women (p < 0.001) than men (p < 0.05). No changes were found in the other parameters, irrespective of gender. CONCLUSION: In young athletes, DHEA administration induces significant blood hormonal changes, some modulated by gender, which can be used as biomarkers of doping.",

      "abstract": "AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D treatment on ovary in experimentally designed polycystic ovary syndrome of female rats using light and electron microscopic techniques. METHODS: Twenty-four female pre-pubertal rats were divided into control, DHEA and DHEA+Vit.D groups. In DHEA group, the PCOS rat model was developed by 6mg/kg/day dehydroepiandrosterone administration as subcutaneously injections. In DHEA+Vit.D group, 6 mg/kg/day DHEA and 120ng/100g/week 1,25(OH)2D3 was performed simultaneously. Controls were injected with vehicle alone. At the end of the 28 days, blood samples were collected and the ovarian tissues were taken for histological examinations. RESULTS: FSH, LH levels, LH/FSH ratio, and testosterone levels showed a significant increase in DHEA group when compared with the control group. Moreover, these measurements were lower in the treatment group than the DHEA group. In DHEA group, increased number of atretic follicles and cystic follicles were seen with light microscopic analysis. Cystic follicles with attenuated granulosa cell layers and thickened theca cell layers and lipid accumulation in interstitial cells were observed by electron microscope. It is observed that atretic and cystic follicles were decreased as a result of vitamin D treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the curative role of vitamin D treatment on the androgen excess in PCOS rat model which causes abnormalities in ovarian morphology and functions. Vitamin D has positive effects on the hormonal and structural changes observed in PCOS, but it has been concluded that long-term use may be more beneficial.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In literature, recent evidence has shown that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can be dysregulated in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HPA axis hormones may predict the psychotherapy treatment response in patients with PTSD. In this study, it was aimed to investigate changing cortisol and DHEA-S levels post-eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy and the relationship between treatment response and basal cortisol, and DHEA-S levels before treatment. METHOD: The study group comprised 40 adolescents (age, 12-18 years) with PTSD. The PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and Child Post-traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPSRI) and the blood cortisol and DHEA-S were measured with the chemiluminescence method before and after treatment. A maximum of six sessions of EMDR therapy were conducted by an EMDR level-1 trained child psychiatry resident. Treatment response was measured by the pre- to post-treatment decrease in self-reported and clinical PTSD severity. RESULTS: Pre- and post-treatment DHEA-S and cortisol levels did not show any statistically significant difference. Pre-treatment CDI scores were negatively correlated with pre-treatment DHEA-S levels (r: -0.39). ROC analysis demonstrated that the DHEA-S/cortisol ratio predicts treatment response at a medium level (AUC: 0.703, p: .030, sensitivity: 0.65, specificity: 0.86). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that the DHEA-S/cortisol ratio may predict treatment response in adolescents with PTSD receiving EMDR therapy. The biochemical parameter of HPA-axis activity appears to be an important predictor of positive clinical response in adolescent PTSD patients, and could be used in clinical practice to predict PTSD treatment in the future.",

The feasibility of conducting a large trial is also assessed by evaluating the recruitment rates and compliance of the recruited participants with DHEA/placebo intake and follow-up rates. STUDY DESIGN: A single centre, double blinded, placebo controlled, randomized trial was performed over two years with 60 women undergoing in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Subjects were randomized, based on a computer-generated pseudo-random code to receive either DHEA or placebo with both capsules having similar colour, size and appearance. 60 women with poor OR based on antral follicle count or anti-Mullerian hormone thresholds undergoing IVF were recruited. They were randomised to receive DHEA 75mg/day or placebo for at-least 12 weeks before starting ovarian stimulation. They had long protocol using hMG 300 IU/day. Data analysed by \"intention to treat\". Ovarian response, live birth rates and molecular markers of oocyte quality were compared between the study and control groups. RESULTS: The recruitment rate was 39% (60/154). A total of 52 participants (27 versus 25 in the study and placebo groups) were included in the final analysis after excluding eight. While the mean (standard deviation) DHEA levels were similar at recruitment (9.4 (5) versus 7.5 (2.4) ng/ml; P=0.1), the DHEA levels at pre-stimulation were higher in the study group than in the controls (16.3 (5.8) versus 11.1 (4.5) ng/ml; P<0.01). The number (median, range) of oocytes retrieved (4, 0-18 versus 4, 0-15 respectively; P=0.54) and live birth rates (7/27, 26% versus 8/25, 32% respectively; RR (95% CI): 0.74 (0.22-2.48) and mRNA expression of developmental biomarkers in granulosa and cumulus cells were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment DHEA supplementation, albeit statistical power in this study is low, did not improve the response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation or oocyte quality or live birth rates during IVF treatment with long protocol in women predicted to have poor OR.",

      "abstract": "Ribavirin has been widely used for antiviral therapy. Unfortunately, ribavirin-induced anemia is often a cause of limiting or interrupting treatment. Our team has observed that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has a protective effect against in vitro and in vivo ribavirin-induced hemolysis. The aim of this study was to better understand this effect as well as the underlying mechanism(s). DHEA was able to reduce in vitro intraerythrocytic ATP depletion induced by ribavirin. Only 1% of ATP remained after incubation with ribavirin (2 mM) at 37 °C for 24 h vs. 37% if DHEA (200 μM) was added (p < 0.01). DHEA also helped erythrocytes conserve their size, with a shrinkage of only 10% vs 40% at 24 h with ribavirin alone (p < 0.01), and reduced phosphatidylserine exposure at the outer membrane, i.e. 27% vs 40% at 48 h, (p < 0.05). DHEA also inhibits ribavirin-induced hemolysis, i.e. 34% vs 46.5% at 72 h (p < 0.01). DHEA is an inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a key enzyme in the hexose monophosphate shunt connected to the glycolytic pathway which is the only energy supplier of the red blood cell in the form of ATP. We have confirmed this inhibitory effect in the presence of ribavirin. All these observations suggest that ribavirin-induced hemolysis was initiated by ATP depletion, and that the inhibitory effect of DHEA on G6PD was able to rescue enough ATP to limit this hemolysis. This mechanism could be important for improving the therapeutic management of patients treated with ribavirin.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common neoplasias and the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Its high mortality rate is linked to a great metastatic capacity associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During this process, a decrease in epithelial proteins expression and an increase of mesenchymal proteins are observed. On the other hand, it has been shown that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the most abundant steroid in human plasma, inhibits migration of breast cancer cells; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, the in vitro effect of DHEA on the expression pattern of some EMT-related proteins, such as E-cadherin (epithelial), N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail (mesenchymal) was measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with invasive, metastatic and mesenchymal phenotype. Also, the in vivo effect of DHEA on xenograft tumor growth in nude mice (nu-/nu-) and on expression of the same epithelial and mesenchymal proteins in generated tumors was evaluated. We found that DHEA increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail expression both in MD-MB-231 cells and in the formed tumors, possibly by DHEA-induced reversion of mesenchymal phenotype. These results were correlated with a tumor size reduction in mouse xenografts following DHEA administration either a week earlier or concurrent with breast cancer cells inoculation. In conclusion, DHEA could be useful in the treatment of breast cancer with mesenchymal phenotype.",

      "abstract": "Our recent study has shown that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) administered to rabbits partially ameliorated several dexamethasone (dexP) effects on hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance and plasma lipid disorders. In the current investigation, we present the data on DHEA protective action against dexP-induced oxidative stress and albuminuria in rabbits. Four groups of adult male rabbits were used in the in vivo experiment: (1) control, (2) dexP-treated, (3) DHEA-treated and (4) both dexP- and DHEA-treated. Administration of dexP resulted in accelerated generation of renal hydroxyl free radicals (HFR) and malondialdehyde (MDA), accompanied by diminished superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and a dramatic rise in urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. Treatment with DHEA markedly reduced dexP-induced oxidative stress in kidney-cortex due to a decline in NADPH oxidase activity and enhancement of catalase activity. Moreover, DHEA effectively attenuated dexP-evoked albuminuria. Surprisingly, dexP-treated rabbits exhibited elevation of GSH/GSSG ratio, accompanied by a decrease in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities as well as an increase in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity. Treatment with DHEA resulted in a decline in GSH/GSSG ratio and glutathione reductase (GR) activity, accompanied by an elevation of GPx activity. Interestingly, rabbits treated with both dexP and DHEA remained the control values of GSH/GSSG ratio. As the co-administration of DHEA with dexP resulted in (i) reduction of oxidative stress in kidney-cortex, (ii) attenuation of albuminuria and (iii) normalization of glutathione redox state, DHEA might limit several undesirable renal side effects during chronic GC treatment of patients suffering from allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Moreover, its supplementation might be particularly beneficial for the therapy of patients with glucocorticoid-induced diabetes.",
