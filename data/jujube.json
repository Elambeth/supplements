      "abstract": "Soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling and microbial metabolism limitations are key factors affecting nutrient cycling and vegetation development. Extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) plays a key role in carbon and nutrient cycling in ecosystems, and their activities can serve as indicators of microbial nutrient requirements. At present, there is insufficient research on the nutrient limitations of microorganisms during ecosystem transition in abandoned jujube forests on the Loess Plateau. Four modes were selected: jujube forest replanted with Pinus tabulaeformis (CP), with Platycladus orientalis (PO), with medicinal materials (MM), and with alfalfa (AL). An abandoned jujube forest (CK) was used as a control. Soil physical and chemical properties, microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, as well as changes in the activities of β-1,4-glucosidase (BG), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), and alkaline phosphatase (AP), were studied. Analysis of changes in soil microbial nutrient limitations was performed. Compared with those in the CK treatment, the activities of soil C, N, and P extracellular enzymes significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the forest transition treatments, and the C:NEEA, C:PEEA, and N:PEEA ratios of extracellular enzymes tended to decrease. Within the treatments, the activities of soil C, N, and P extracellular enzymes decreased as the soil layer deepened, whereas the enzyme stoichiometric ratio increased as the soil layer deepened, with significant differences observed between the soil layers. The vector model was used to quantify nutrient limitations in microbial metabolism and revealed that microbial metabolism in surface soil was limited mainly by C and P and that in the 10-20 cm and 20-40 cm layers, soil microbial metabolism was limited mainly by C and N. Correlation analysis revealed that SOC, pH, MBC, and MBN were the main factors affecting soil extracellular enzyme activity. Mantel's test revealed that (NAG + LAP), AP, C:NEEA, and C:PEEA were important factors affecting vector length and angle. RAD analysis revealed that microbial properties had a greater impact on enzyme stoichiometry and microbial metabolic limitations than physicochemical indicators did. This study highlights the importance of vegetation in determining microbial metabolic processes and enhances our understanding of how ecological changes in jujube forests affect soil nutrient cycling and microbial metabolic constraints on the Loess Plateau. Forest transformation modes have important impacts on soil extracellular enzyme activity and microbial nutrient limitation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of insomnia is increasing annually worldwide. Most Western tranquilisers have side effects, such as strong dependence and notable withdrawal reactions. The sour jujube kernel and five-flavour berry can calm the mind and improve sleep, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the active ingredients and mechanism of action of the sour jujube kernel-fiveflavour berry pair in treating insomnia. METHODS: The chemical compositions and targets of sour jujube kernels and five-flavoured berries were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform, Pub- Chem, and PharmMapper. Insomnia disease targets were screened using the GeneCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and Therapeutic Target Database. We constructed shared target data for topological analysis and network construction using the STRING database and the Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology functional and metabolic pathway analyses were performed using the DAVID database and validated through molecular docking using AutoDock and PyMOL software. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that the sour jujube kernel and five-flavour berry combination primarily addresses insomnia through the activity of eight hub genes: ALB, CASP3, DRD1, ESR1, MAOB, NOS3, SLC6A3, and SLC6A4. Molecular docking simulations showed that jujuboside A exhibited robust docking to these hub genes, whereas longikaurin A showed a strong binding affinity with ALB and ESR1. CONCLUSION: We establish a theoretical foundation for further experimental studies, which may lead to the application of sour jujube kernel in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "Culex pipiens (Cx. pipiens) are ubiquitous vectors of public health pathogens responsible for numerous human diseases. Consequently, their management is imperative. So, this study aimed to assess the susceptibility of third instar larvae of Cx. pipiens to distinct concentrations of jujube oil, LC50 and LC90 were determined. Also, the developmental duration of immatures, percentage of emerged adults, and the physiological responses at the sublethal concentration were recorded. GC-MS analysis was carried out to characterize the fractions of the jujube oil. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis was utilized. The results showed that the third instar larvae were susceptible to jujube oil, with larval mortality escalating in correlation with increased oil concentration and exposure time. Sublethal exposure to the oil significantly prolonged the larval developmental duration from 11 days of control to 15 days of treated. Conversely, the percentage of the emerged adults were decreased from 88.89% in the control to 17.78%in the treated. The data also indicated that the treatment of the larvae with the sublethal concentration significantly decreased the activities of acetylcholinesterase, glutathione S transferase, arginine kinase, cytochrome P450, and ecdysone. Conversely, the titers of catalase and 3-hydroxykynurenine were increased. The GC-MS analysis identified 9-Octadecenoic acid, methyl ester, (E)-, Octadecanoic acid, methyl ester and Hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester as predominant components. Bioinformatics assessments indicated ecdysone, juvenile hormone, and tryptophan oxygenase showed the lowest binding affinity scores. In sum, this study supports the potential of jujube oil as an effective alternative botanical agent for control of Cx. pipiens larvae."

      "abstract": "Low-temperature storage is an effective method to extend the shelf life of harvested winter jujube fruit; however, the quality of winter jujube fruit decreases after refrigeration. To enhance the quality of winter jujube with minimum qualitative deterioration during cold storage, this study investigated the effects of different melatonin concentration (100, 150, and 200 µmol/L) treatments on the storage quality of winter jujube (during the white ripening stage) at 0 ± 1 °C (RH, 90 ± 5%) for 90 days. The relative indexes of the fruit quality and the antioxidant system were measured every 15 days. The results showed that different concentrations of melatonin treatments could maintain the fruit's firmness, retard the fruit's redness, and inhibit the decrease in weight, total soluble solid (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), and the contents of total phenols, flavonoids, glutathione, and ascorbic acid; they also inhibited the increase in relative conductivity, malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content of jujube fruits and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), and peroxidase (POD)). As a whole, the 200 µmol/L melatonin treatment had the best effect. Therefore, melatonin treatment can maintain the cold-stored quality of postharvest winter jujube by improving its antioxidant capacity."

      "abstract": "To valorize sour jujube (Ziziphus acidojujuba) leaves, this work focused on the extraction, quantification, and bioactivity assessment of flavonoids. First, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was employed to extract total flavonoids from sour jujube leaves (SJL-TF), with the procedure optimized through single-factor design and response surface methodology (RSM). SJL-TF yield reached 48.47 ± 0.36 mg/g under optimal circumstances, which included 61 % ethanol as extraction medium, an ultrasound power of 300 W, an extraction time of 33 min, and a liquid-solid ratio of 16 mL/g, showing higher extraction efficiency in comparison to the traditional Soxhlet extraction method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that ultrasound treatment severely damaged the structural integrity of sour jujube leaves, which was more conducive to improving the SJL-TF yield. Then, polyamide resin chromatography was used to purify the crude SJL-TF extracts, increasing the SJL-TF purity by 3.2-fold to 74.58 ± 0.63 %. By developing and validating a UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS method, ten main flavonoids in SJL-TF extracts, including catechin, rutin, isoquercetin, narirutin, nicotiflorin, quercitrin, phlorizin, luteolin, quercetin, and apigenin, were successfully detected concurrently for quality control purposes. Furthermore, the purified SJL-TF showed a strong ameliorative effect on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice, as evidenced by significant mitigation of colonic inflammation and pathological damage. Thus, this work will contribute to improving the application of sour jujube leaves, especially in the pharmaceutical sector.",

      "abstract": "CD44 is a complex transmembrane glycoprotein that exists in multiple molecular forms and aberrant expression of CD44 is associated with tumorigenesis and progression. CD44 is involved in the regulation of several important signaling pathways, including tumor proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance, and it is also regulated by a variety of cells, which is a common biomarker for cancer stem cells. Detection and quantification of CD44 can provide essential information useful for clinical cancer diagnosis. Electrochemical sensors are prominently used for the detection of cancer biomarkers due to their rapidity, robustness, ease of miniaturization, excellent sensitivity and selectivity. In this study, we synthesized two cobalt-based materials under different atmospheres by photochemical metal-organic deposition methods (PMOD) and thermal annealing treatments, and then built and optimized two cobalt-based sensors that produce responses to CD44. The results showed that the performance of HA-Co@Co3O4 (HCo@Co3O4) electrodes were superior to that of HA-CoO@Co3O4 (HCoO@Co3O4) in terms of detection limit, sensitivity and stability, the linear range was 1 × 10-5 to 1 × 103 ng mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.619 × 10-5ng mL-1, the trend of the test results was consistent with the conventional Elisa method. The effects of different annealing atmospheres on the electrochemical activity of cobalt oxide-based materials for the detection of CD44 were investigated, which provided an experimental and theoretical basis for the electrochemical detection of CD44 and other types of tumor markers by cobalt oxides. In biomedical detection, very low concentration detection is conducive to the monitoring of CD44 dynamic changes: low concentration of CD44 changes can be detected, which is conducive to the early detection of diseases. In addition, the outstanding detection limit indicates the high selectivity of the material for the target molecule in complex biological samples and the high stability in complex biological samples, it provides a detection basis for future clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The therapeutic efficacy of oral administration of Ziziphus jujube in the context of uterine adhesion (UA) and its impact on pregnancy outcomes was investigated. METHODS: In a rat UA model, Z. jujube was evaluated for its ability to mitigate injury-induced uterine adhesion bands, uterine shortening, and enhance endometrial regeneration. The assessment included analysis of gland numbers, uterine endometrial thickness, and regulation of inflammatory cytokines. The antioxidant properties of Z. jujube were also studied through antioxidant enzyme activity in uterine tissue homogenates. Fibrotic changes were examined through histological Trichrome staining and analysis of pro-fibrotic factors. RESULTS: Treatment with Z. jujube resulted in a significant reduction in uterine tissue fibrosis, as evidenced by histological evaluation and reduced expression of fibrotic markers. The intervention demonstrated positive outcomes in embryonic development, pregnancy rates, and pregnancy outcomes. Z. jujube effectively inhibited the formation of extra-uterine adhesion bands to internal organs. No toxicity-related morphological changes were observed in vital organs of the Z. Jujube-treated group. DISCUSSION: The results collectively indicate that Z. jujube is a safe and potent natural product with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, highlighting its potential as a novel candidate for clinical studies targeting UA in patients."

      "abstract": "Indian jujube fruit is prone to perishing, resulting in a shorter shelf life after harvest. Kadozan is a liquid chitosan formulation that has a significant effect on fruit preservation. In order to explore its efficacy, the quality, and storability indicators of Indian jujube fruit were evaluated during storage at 15 ± 1 °C for 18 days. Results showed that Kadozan-treated fruit exhibited lower respiration rate, relative electrolyte leakage rate, weight loss, and decay index, along with higher firmness and commercially acceptable rate. Furthermore, Kadozan-treated fruit showed higher vitamin C, total sugar, titratable acid, total soluble solids, chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents, L* and h° values, but lower a* and b* values. Principal component analysis and comprehensive score revealed that Kadozan treatment helped preserve the appearance and nutritional qualities of Indian jujube fruit. The best effect was seen with 1:600 Kadozan among three concentrations (1:300, 1:600, 1:900). It was discovered that the commercially acceptable rate of 1:600 Kadozan-treated fruit was 37.5% higher than control fruit while the decay index was 30.5% lower than control fruit at 18 days. Therefore, Kadozan treatment has great substantial implications for the preservation of Indian jujube fruit, providing practical guidance for reducing its postharvest losses."

Vitamin C (VC) content, red and green value (a*), and drying rate (DR) were used as quality indexes, and the changing trend of texture properties was analyzed. According to the conclusion of the single-factor experiment, the orthogonal experiment is carried out, and the parameters of each factor in the orthogonal experiment are optimized by the comprehensive balance method and matrix analysis method. The results showed as follows: (1) Plate spacing, RF application, and interval time all significantly affected the drying properties in the single-factor test (p < 0.05). The VC content of winter jujube slices increased and then decreased with the increase in the three factors. (2) In the orthogonal test, the order of influence of each factor on the quality of the winter jujube tablet is plate spacing > RF interval time > RF application time. The optimum RF heat treatment parameters are plate spacing of 100 mm, RF application time of 3 min, and RF interval time of 2 min. Under these conditions, the VC content of the winter jujube slices was 258.35 mg/100 g, a* was -9.47 and the DR was 0.64 g/min. (3) RF + HA has more advantages in shortening drying time and maintaining shape, reducing hardness by 12.6 ~ 18.7% and crispiness by 13.8 ~ 20.4%, the microstructure of jujube slices shows a regular honeycomb shape. The research results provide a new drying combination mechanism and process optimization scheme for improving the drying technology of winter jujube slices in industrial production."

Consequently, the role of MAPK cascades in mediating jujube cold stress response remains unclear, with the specific function of ZjMAPKK4 in this context yet to be fully elucidated. Thus, in the current study, it was found that ZjMAPKK4 was significantly upregulated compared with other ZjMAPK cascade genes after cold treatment. Heterologous transformation of ZjMAPKK4 in Arabidopsis, VIGS-induced ZjMAPKK4 transiently silencing and overexpression of ZjMAPKK4 in jujube callus assays demonstrated that ZjMAPKK4 positively regulated the cold resistance of jujube. Furthermore, to elucidate the molecular regulation mechanism behind ZjMAPKK4 under cold stress, 25 key DEGs were screened out by transcriptome analysis. Yeast screening cDNA library, yeast two-hybrid, LCA and Co-IP analysis showed ZjMAPKK4 interacted with ZjNAC78 and VIGS-induced ZjNAC78 silenced sour jujube plants showed cold sensitivity and the expression level of cold response genes were downregulated after cold stress. All the results demonstrated that ZjMAPKK4 could interact with ZjNAC78 to regulate the downstream ZjICE-ZjCBF genes to regulate the cold tolerance of jujube.",

Ziziphus jujuba has been used in traditional medicine for various diseases such as constipation. A safe and inexpensive treatment with few side effects can be used as an effective alternative to current medications. In this study, we sought to compare Ziziphus jujuba syrup (ZS) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for the treatment of pediatric functional constipation. A double-blind, randomized clinical trial was performed on children aged 2-10 years with functional constipation who were referred to the gastroenterology clinic of the 17-Shahrivar Hospital in Rasht, Iran. Eligible patients were randomized into two groups: PEG group; 1-5 cc/kg/day (40% w/v solution without electrolytes; average dose: 0.2-1 g/kg), and ZS group; 1-5 cc/kg/day (average dose: 5-25 mg/kg). All patients were followed up for three months, every 2 weeks in the first month, and then monthly for 2 months. At the beginning and end of the study, liver and kidney function tests and blood sugar levels were checked. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 19 at a significance level of 0.05. Out of 90 eligible children, 32 patients in the PEG group and 30 patients in the ZS group completed the follow-up visits. The mean age of the subjects was 4.31 ± 1.97 years. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age (P = 0.181), gender (P = 0.218), age at onset of constipation (P = 0.083), and weight (P = 0.199). The average therapeutic response score in the ZS group improved prominently compared to the PEG group (P < 0.05). The average number of encopresis and visual analog scale pain scores significantly decreased in the ZS group compared to the PEG group (P < 0.05). Other indices, including frequency of defecation, and medication adherence in the ZS group were significantly improved compared to the PEG group (P < 0.05). Only in the PEG group, a few cases reported self-limiting side effects. ZS can be a treatment choice for functional constipation without any adverse events or liver or kidney injury in children. However, further studies are necessary to find potential side effects.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different dietary supplementation levels with jujube fruit powder on the performance, biochemical parameters, and egg quality characteristics of laying quails. A total of 60 quails (45 days old) were randomly assigned to treatments with different levels of jujube fruit powder: a basal diet (control) and diets supplemented with 5 g/kg (T1), 10 g/kg (T2), with five replicates per treatment (20 quails/treatment and four quails/replicate). The differences between 1-15 and 16-30 days for feed intake (p<0.05), 1-60 days for egg production (p<0.05), 16-30 days for egg weight (p<0.05), and 1-15 and 1-60 days for feed conversion ratio were statistically significant. The highest values for egg width (p<0.01) and egg length (p<0.05) were found in the control group (25.87 and 33.55 mm), while lower values were observed in the T1 and T2 groups. There was no statistical difference between the groups in egg shape index, shell weight, shell ratio, and shell thickness (p>0.05). The yolk height (p<0.05) and yolk diameter (p<0.01) were statistically significant. The differences between the groups for all serum biochemical parameters were insignificant (p>0.05). According to the results of this study, jujube fruit, a rich energy source, can be used as an alternative supplement in poultry diets with positive effects on egg production and feed conversion ratio.",

In this study, jujube juice was used as a substrate and fermented by L. acidophilus 6074 to investigate its effects on gut microbiota, intestinal barrier function, oxidative stress, inflammatory factors, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in mice with colitis and to reveal its potential mechanism for alleviating colitis. The results demonstrated that fermentation caused significant changes in the nutrients and nonnutrients of jujube juice, mainly in organic acids (malic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, and succinic acid) and free amino acids (Thr, Met, Ser, Ile, and Lys). High-dose LAFJ (20 mL/kg/day) significantly reduced the disease activity index (DAI), improved histopathological morphology, and increased colon length in colitis mice. LAFJ alleviated colon damage and preserved the integrity of the colonic mucosal barrier by promoting the expression of colonic tight junction proteins occludin, claudin-1, and zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1). Furthermore, LAFJ inhibited the production of proinflammatory factors and attenuated oxidative stress. Gut microbiota of mice revealed that LAFJ increased beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia, promoted the production of SCFAs, and inhibited the growth of harmful microorganisms. Overall, LAFJ could reshape and restore gut microbiota imbalance caused by intestinal inflammation and alleviate the development of colitis, which may become a novel dietary intervention.",

      "abstract": "Organic fertilizer application in agricultural land is known to improve soil microbial processes, fertility, and yield. In particular, the changes in soil chemical composition due to multi-year application of organic fertilizers are thought to alter the microbial community. Here, the effects of organic fertilization with oil-cake amendments (OC) on soil bacterial diversity, community profile, and enzyme activity were evaluated and compared to those amended with chemical fertilizer (NPK). Diversity indices show that the application of organic fertilizer potentially increases microbial diversity as well as the number of different microbial groups. The ordination plot distinguished and clustered both treatments, showing the differential effects of soil chemical factors on the microbial communities in each treatment. Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Bacteriodetes were significantly more abundant in OC-amended soil than in the NPK soil, indicating alterations in community structure, composition, and diversity, concurrent to the changes in the pH, Ca, and Mg contents of the soil. These shifts in bacterial community structure and composition, partially explained by differences in soil chemical factors, could be observed from the phylum to the genus level in NPK- and OC-amended soils. The OC soil contained a significantly higher abundance of predicted genes corresponding to enzymes related to biogeochemical cycling, decomposition, and plant growth promotion. Collectively, these results support the use of an unconventional organic fertilizer positively altering bacterial populations in jujube orchards. The application of an unconventional organic fertilizer improved microbial diversity and enhanced ecosystem functions related to biogeochemical cycles, mineralization, and plant growth promotion.",

      "abstract": "The C2H2 type zinc finger proteins (C2H2-ZFPs) are prevalent motifs found widely across the eukaryotic kingdom, playing crucial roles in various biological processes, including stress responses and plant growth and development. To date, C2H2-ZFPs have been identified in many plant systems, but there have been no reports in Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.). In this study, a total of 77 ZjC2H2-ZFPs were identified in Chinese jujube and classified into three groups, with set A containing 29 genes, set B containing two genes, and set C containing 46 genes. The set A group genes were further divided into three groups: A1, A2, and A4 (with no member of the A3 subgroup found in jujube). The set C C2H2-ZFPs genes were also further divided into three groups: C1 containing 24 genes, C2 with two genes, and C3 with three genes. These ZjC2H2-ZFPs were distributed on 12 chromosomes and one tandem duplicated pair of ZjC2H2-ZFPs was found on chromosome 4 (ZjC2H2-21 with ZjC2H2-22). Notably, the 77 ZjC2H2-ZFPs identified in this study lacked finger clusters comprising 10 or more repeats. The structure and protein motif analysis of ZjC2H2-ZFPs showed that most C1 subgroup members were enriched with 'QALGGH' motif zinc finger helices and the A1a ZjC2H2-ZFPs contained highly conserved 'SATALLQKAAQMGS' residues in jujube. A unique finding was the discovery of a conserved non-finger domain (PCYCC motif) in A1 group members, absent in other ZjC2H2-ZFPs and unreported in other species. The enzyme activity of jujube leaves under different water stress treatments were measured, and the results showed that as the degree of water stress increased, the activity of SOD enzymes and H2O2 content also increased. The POD enzyme activity levels of different treatment groups were CK>MS>SS>LS. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) content observed under various treatments were notably higher and the proline content was lower in comparison to the control group (CK). Differential expression of ZjC2H2-ZFPs and specific responses were analyzed under water stress and different fruit development stages of jujube using RNA-Seq data. The correlation between expression patterns and protective enzyme activities under water stress was also examined. The results indicated that the expression levels of different ZjC2H2-ZFPs varied. A further protein interaction analysis indicated that ZjC2H2-ZFPs serve as pivotal transcriptional regulators with diverse functions, encompassing DNA or RNA binding and participation in protein interactions, with ZjC2H2-20, ZjC2H2-36, and ZjC2H2-57 being potential key players in these regulatory processes. Their roles appear particularly crucial in responding to abiotic stresses like water stress and regulating plant hormones. This study provides valuable insights into understanding stress responses and enhancing the quality of Chinese jujube during breeding.",

Results showed that facility high temperature (HT) promoted DZ fruit enlargement in the early stage, accelerated fruit coloration and softening, and improved most fruit quality-related parameters. However, it decreased the vitamin C (VC) content and antioxidant capacities of DZ fruits, and eventually led to smaller fruits. CF treatment improved the positive effects of HT on DZ fruits and anthocyanins accumulation in fruit peel, and alleviated VC content reduction caused by HT. Our study demonstrated the promoting effects of facility warming and CF on fruit ripening and quality of winter jujube and revealed the underlying physiological mechanism."

The current study objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of jujube oxymel (JO) for treating CSU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized double-blind controlled trial, 92 patients (aged 12-65) with CSU were randomly allocated to JO or placebo groups. They received 30cc of each syrup three times daily with 10 mg cetirizine for 28 days, subsequently taking 10 mg cetirizine alone for the next 4 weeks. Outcomes were evaluated using the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS-7) and Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL). RESULTS: After four weeks, the UAS-7 score mean and standard deviation in the JO group significantly decreased to 10.89 ± 4.87 compared to the placebo group at 15.06 ± 7.55 (P: 0.002). In the follow-up period, JO group participants achieved a score of 10.28 (4.67), while a significant increase occurred in the control group (18.33 ± 6.29) (P = 0.001). On day 28, there was a notable improvement in the quality of life within the JO group (P < 0.05). By the eighth week, both groups experienced an increase in CU-Q2oL score, but the changes in the control group were statistically significant (18.09 (5.96) vs 41.31 (10.34) (P: 0.001). CONCLUSION: JO, as part of integrated therapy, exhibited potentially longer-lasting efficacy than cetirizine alone, contributing to enhanced quality of life and increased patient satisfaction due to minimal side effects."

      "abstract": "This study used an ultrasonically accelerated metal-free Fenton (H2O2-Vc system) reaction to promote water-extracted degrading polysaccharides from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao (DZMP). A novel jujube polysaccharide (DPZMP3) was obtained by degradation using DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-100 column chromatography. Methylation analysis, HPGPC, ion chromatography, FT-IR, and NMR spectroscopies were used to clarify the chemical structures of DPZMP3. Monosaccharide compositional analysis of DPZMP3 revealed the presence of Rha, Ara, Gal, and GalA at a molar ratio of 1.00:1.49:1.60:7.68, and the HPGPC data demonstrated the average Mw of 34.3 kDa. Based on the structural and linkage research using NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS, it was determined that DPZMP3 was a homogalacturonan pectic polysaccharide with a (1 → 4)-Galp branch at C-6 and a small amount of Araf and Rhap residues. The ultrasonic-aided Fenton treatment did not significantly alter the structure of DPZMP3. It may also be useful for DZMP and enhancing their antioxidant activity in vitro. The current study's findings could pave the way for the food sector to use jujube polysaccharides obtained by degradation as a functional food component."

The results showed that BPEs significantly improved Cd-induced behavioral deficits in C. elegans, and no significant differences could be found in low-dose (12.5 µg/mL) and high-dose (100 µg/mL) BPEs improvement groups. The treatment of BPEs effectively improved intestinal injury and lipofuscin and lipid accumulation. Especially, oil red O staining intensity in C. elegans treated with BPEs at 50 µg/mL was reduced by 12.60%. BPEs significantly controlled the increase in content of C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, and C18:2 induced by Cd by regulating the lipid accumulation in Escherichia coli OP50. Cd exposure induced lipid accumulation in C. elegans by upregulating oleic acid synthesis-related gene expression in E. coli OP50. Furthermore, BPEs treatment significantly downregulated the fatty acid synthesis-related gene expression in C. elegans and E. coli OP50. This research could reveal the mechanism of BPEs of jujube peel in relieving Cd-induced toxicity and provide a theoretical basis for the development of functional foods rich in polyphenols. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Jujube peel, a by-product of jujube processing, is usually discarded due to its coarse texture. However, jujube peel has been proven to possess abundant polyphenols, polysaccharides, and cyclic adenosine phosphate. In addition, in our previous research, bound phenolics extracts (BPEs) of jujube peel were found to perform better in lowering lipid accumulation than that of free phenolics extracts. This study further investigate the effect of BPEs of jujube peel on relieving Cd-induced toxicity and its mechanism on the base of our previous research. It could realize the comprehensive utilization of by-products of jujube processing.",

Therefore, in the framework aimed at studying the antiviral properties of extractive mixtures from fruits (and their waste) grown in the Campania Region (Italy), jujube drupes (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.) were our focus. The drupes were dissected into their peel, pulp and seed parts, each of which was extracted by ultrasound-assisted maceration and further fractionated, thus obtaining, beyond the sugar fraction, a polyphenolic fraction and a lipid fraction. UHPLC-HR MS/MS tools highlighted that the polyphenolic component of the seed was strongly dissimilar from that of the edible parts, being constituted by swertisin and its derivatives. Moreover, the peel mostly accounted for triglycosylated flavonols, whereas the pulp was rich in volatile aromatic glycosides. Among lipids, p-coumaroyl triterpenes mainly characterized the peel. All fractions were screened for their cytotoxicity, and non-toxic concentrations of each extract were tested against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by plaque assays. Molecular tests and Western blot analyses were also carried out. The jujube mixtures, in detail the peel and pulp polyphenolic fractions, and peel lipophilic fraction (the latter enriched mainly in ursane-type triterpenes), showed a marked inhibitory activity against HSV-1 acting in the early stages of viral infection and preventing attachment of the virus to the host cell. The acquired data suggest jujube active mixtures as promising candidates for the prevention and treatment of herpetic lesions."

Jujube fruit extracts significantly decreased the level of malonaldehyde (MDA) and increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Meanwhile, there was no significant improvement in the catalase (CAT) levels. In addition, there was considerable heterogeneity in the results of the meta-analysis. The results of the subgroup analysis indicated that the animal model, type of extracts, and source of target parameters may have contributed to the heterogeneity. Jujube fruit extracts are healthy and effective antioxidant dietary supplements that may be an effective adjunctive therapy for diseases in which oxidative stress is a major pathological factor. However, the overall methodological quality of the included studies was low, and additional research is warranted."

      "abstract": "The postharvest quality of winter jujubes is prone to deterioration, including inevitable pericarp reddening and rapid nutrient loss from the flesh, significantly impacting its edible quality and commercial value. As a crucial metabolic pathway in plants, phenylpropane metabolism not only regulates plant stress resistance but also closely relates to various coloration effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of luteolin solutions on postharvest color changes and phenylpropanoid metabolism in winter jujube. The results indicated that compared to the control group, winter jujube fruit treated with 200 mg L-1 luteolin exhibited improved quality indexes, increased antioxidant capacity (capability of eliminating ABTS and DPPH radicals), and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes(superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)). This led to a reduction in the oxidation of phenolic substances in winter jujube. Furthermore, luteolin treatment inhibited phenylpropanoid metabolism by suppressing the activities of 4-Coumarate: coenzyme A ligase (4CL), phenylalanine ammonilyase (PAL), and cinnamate 4 hydroxylase (C4H), as well as the expression of ZjUFGT, ZjDFT, and ZjPAL genes. Consequently, anthocyanin and quercetin synthesis were limited while the degradation rate of chlorophyll and carotenoid synthesis were slowed down after luteolin treatment. This resulted in delayed reddening of winter jujube following luteolin treatment. In conclusion, luteolin exhibits potential application prospects as a preservative for inhibiting reddening and browning in winter jujubes.",

The research revealed that treatment with Debaryomyces nepalensis altered the surface microbial community, reducing the presence of harmful fungi such as Alternaria, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Botrytis, while boosting beneficial bacteria like Pantoea, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas, leading to a decreased decay rate in date fruits. A synthetic community was crafted, integrating D. nepalensis with seven other bacterial strains selected for their abundance, compatibility, culturability, and interactions. This community was refined through homo-pore damage experiments and safety assessments to a final formulation consisting of D. nepalensis and six other bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus velezensis, Staphylococcus arlettae, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Pseudomonas sp., and Pseudomonas psychrotolerans. Fruit inoculation tests demonstrated that this synthetic community (6 + 1) significantly lowered the incidence and size of black spot lesions compared to single-strain treatments. By the 10th day of storage, the incidence was 69.23 % lower than the control and 52.94 % lower than the group treated solely with D. nepalensis. Mechanistic studies of the synthetic community's antibacterial effects showed that it can produce volatile compounds, proteases, and β-1,3-glucanase to inhibit pathogen growth. Additionally, the community forms a biofilm to compete for nutrients and induce jujube resistance to disease.",

T2DM not only seriously affects people's health and quality of life, but also brings a heavy burden to society and economy. At present, the treatment of T2DM mainly relies on drug therapy, but these drugs often have problems such as side effects, resistance and high cost, and can not fully meet the needs and expectations of patients. Therefore, it is of great significance and value to find safe and effective natural medicines or functional foods to assist the treatment and prevention of T2DM. OBJECTIVE: Chinese jujube are a common fruit that contain abundant polyphenolic compounds, which exhibit multiple physiological activities, such as antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and blood glucose lowering. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of red date polyphenols on glycemic control and oxidative stress status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).",

      "abstract": "Ultra-high-pressure (UHP1) technology for cold pasteurization is a viable alternative to traditional heat sterilization for preserving food nutrients and flavor compounds during fruit juice processing. In this study, cutting-edge techniques, including high-throughput sequencing technology, intelligent bionic sensory systems, and metabolomics, were used to examine the impact of UHP treatment on microbial community composition, odor, and taste quality of jujube juice. The UHP treatment demonstrated its effect by inducing a reddish-yellow color in the jujube juice, thereby enhancing its brightness, overall color, and stability. The most significant enhancement was observed at 330 MPa. The microorganisms responsible for spoilage and deterioration of jujube juice during storage were categorized into three clusters: bacterial clusters at 0-330 MPa, 360-450 MPa, and 480-630 Mpa. The results showed no distinct distribution patterns for fungi based on the pressure strength. The dominant bacterial genera were Lactobacillus, Nocardia, Achromobacter, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Mesorhizobium, and Rhodococcus, whereas the dominant fungal genera were yeast and mold. Notably, Lactobacillus, Achromobacter, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas were responsible for the significant differences between the 360 MPa to 450 MPa and 480 MPa to 630 MPa clusters in terms of bacterial spoilage, whereas Torulaspora, Lodderomyces, Wickerhamomyces, and Fusarium were the primary fungal spoilage genera. UHP treatment exerted no significant impact on the taste of jujube juice but influenced its sourness. Treatment at 330 MPa had the most pronounced effect on the presence of aromatic compounds and other odorants, which were substantially increased. Further analysis revealed the prevalence of organic acids, such as malic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid, in jujube juice and demonstrated a consistent relationship between changes in organic acids and sourness. In addition, nine distinct odorants with VIP values greater than 1 were identified in the jujube juice. Among these, methyl acetate and methyl caproate exhibited substantial increases following the UHP treatment at 330 MPa.",

AH treatment down-regulated most genes associated with respiratory metabolism, as well as lignin and anthocyanin biosynthesis, thereby maintaining lower physiological activities, improving taste and color quality of mature-white jujube. Additionally, AH treatment downregulated the genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and disease resistance, while simultaneously upregulating the genes associated with ROS elimination. This suggested that AH treatment could inhibit pathogen infection to prevent the activation of plants' active defense and reduce the ROS-induced damage. In sum, the present study provided a comprehension explanation that AH treatment improved the storage quality attributes of jujube fruit at the genetic level.",

      "abstract": "Black rots lead to great economic losses in winter jujube industry. The objective of this research was to delve into the underlying mechanisms of enhanced resistance of winter jujube fruit to black rot by L-Methionine (Met) treatment. The findings revealed that the application of Met significantly curtailed lesion diameter and decay incidence in winter jujube fruit. The peroxidase (POD) activity in the Met-treated jujubes was 3.06-fold that in the control jujubes after 4 d of treatment. By day 8, the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chitinase (CHI) and β-1,3-glucanase (GLU) in the Met-treated jujubes had surged to their zenith, being 1.39, 1.22, and 1.52 times in the control group, respectively. At the end of storage, the flavonoid and total phenol content remained 1.58 and 1.06 times than that of the control group. Based on metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis, Met treatment upregulated 6 key differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) (succinic acid, trans-ferulic acid, salicylic acid, delphinium pigments, (S)-abscisic acid, and hesperidin-7-neohesperidin), 12 key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (PAL, CYP73A, COMT, 4CL, CAD, POD, UGT72E, ANS, CHS, IAA, TCH4 and PR1), which were involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and plant hormone signal transduction pathway. Further analysis revealed that the most of the enzymes, DEMs and DEGs in this study were associated with both antioxidant and disease resistance. Consequently, Met treatment enhanced disease resistance of winter jujube fruit by elevating antioxidant capacity and triggering defense response. This study might provide theoretical support for utilizing Met in the management and prevention of post-harvest black rot in winter jujube.",

However, data on the modification of JKF, especially on the combination of biological and chemical modifications, are scarce. Therefore, for the first time, we studied the effect of mixed enzymolysis alone or combined with acetylation or carboxymethylation on the structure and adsorption capacities of JKF. After these modifications, the microstructure of JKF became more porous, and its soluble fibre and extractable polyphenol contents, surface area and adsorption capacities for nitrite, copper, and lead ions were all significantly improved (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, mixed enzymatic hydrolysis and acetylation treated JKF showed the highest surface hydrophobicity (43.57) and oil-adsorption ability (4.47 g g-1), while mixed enzymatic hydrolysis and carboxymethylation treated JKF exhibited the highest water adsorption ability (10.66 g g-1), water expansion ability (8.50 mL g-1), and lead and copper ion chelating abilities. Additionally, mixed enzymatic hydrolyzed JKF had the highest nitrite-ion-adsorption ability (10.57 μmol g-1). It can be concluded that mixed enzymolysis combined with carboxymethylation is an optimal way to increase the hydration properties and heavy-metal-adsorption capacity of JKF, while mixed enzymolysis combined with acetylation is an effective approach to enhance the oil-adsorption capacity of JKF."

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on MSCT data obtained from a cohort of 40 patients experiencing esophageal jujube pit impaction. The study period encompassed the interval from December 2018 to November 2019. The analysis involved examining the age distribution of the patients, the location of the jujube pit impaction, its connection to the esophagus, associated complications, and the methods used for treatment. All imaging results were compared with the outcomes of surgical or endoscopic interventions. Results: (1) Out of 40 patients, 30 individuals were 58 years old or above, constituting 75% of the study sample. (2) In 80% of the instances (32 cases), the jujube pit was located in the initial segment of the esophagus, exhibiting a spindle shape with varying levels of central low density. (3) We examined the correlation between the angle of the impacted jujube pit and the esophageal longitudinal axis, categorizing 2 cases as longitudinal impaction, 16 as oblique impaction, and 22 as transverse impaction. Among the 40 cases, 28 displayed only slight thickening of the esophageal wall at the impaction site, while 9 cases exhibited heightened periesophageal fat density, and 3 showed small periesophageal air bubbles. (4) Endoscopic evaluation identified damage to the esophageal mucosa in 35 instances and the formation of esophageal perforation in 5 cases. Among patients with perforation, one or both ends of the jujube pit had penetrated the esophageal wall, accompanied by different levels of surrounding inflammatory encapsulation. Conclusion: MSCT is crucial for pinpointing jujube pit impaction and its relation to the esophageal wall and nearby structures, aiding in preoperative and postoperative complications. It is highly feasible for endoscopic cases but limited in complex ones needing thoracoscopy or open-heart surgery."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are fast and early responses to environmental changes, including pathogen infection. Jujube witches' broom (JWB) is a phytoplasma disease causing great economic loss in jujube production. After phytoplasma infection, the transcriptional, translational, and metabolic levels in jujube were activated, enabling it to survive during phytoplasma invasion. However, no study has yet reported on PTMs in jujube. Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) and lysine succinylation (Ksu) have been popular studies in recent years and their function in plant phytoplasma-stress responses remains unclear. RESULTS: Here, 1656 crotonylated and 282 succinylated jujube proteins were first identified under phytoplasma-stress, of which 198 were simultaneously crotonylated and succinylated. Comparative analysis revealed that 656 proteins, 137 crotonylated and 43 succinylated proteins in jujube were regulated by phytoplasma infection, suggesting that Kcr was more universal than Ksu. Kcr differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were related to ribosomes, photosynthetic and carbon metabolism, while Ksu DEPs were mainly involved in carbon metabolism, the TCA cycle and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The crosstalk network among proteome, crotonylome and succinylome showed that DEPs related to ribosomal, peroxidases and glutathione redox were enriched. Among them, ZjPOD51 and ZjPHGPX2 significantly increased at the protein and Kcr level under phytoplasma-stress. Notably, 7 Kcr sites were identified in ZjPHGPX2, a unique antioxidant enzyme. After inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) treatment, GPX enzyme activity in jujube seedlings was reduced. Further, site-directed mutagenesis of key Kcr modification sites K130 and/or K135 in ZjPHGPX2 significantly reduced its activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study firstly provided large-scale datasets of Kcr and Ksu in phytoplasma-infected jujube and revealed that Kcr modification in ZjPHGPX2 positively regulates its activity.",

Regulating the relationship between fertilization and irrigation can effectively reduce costs and improve economic efficiency. A 2-year water and fertilizer optimization coupling test was conducted to determine the optimal water and nutrient supply scheme. The three-factor randomized block experiment included water (W), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). According to the principal component analysis of each index, each treatment's comprehensive score was obtained. Using yield and economic regression models, the theoretical value and yield value of the optimal economic benefit are inferred. When W, N, and P were applied together, the fruit quality and yield of each treatment significantly differed, and the vitamin C, soluble sugar, and sugar-acid ratio increased significantly with an increase in N fertilizer. However, the titratable acid decreased. An increase in irrigation and nitrogen application significantly increased fruit yield. The comprehensive score was the highest in the N4P3W2 treatment, which improved fruit quality, and the lowest in the N3P3W2 treatment. When the amounts of N, P, and W were 275.56 kg hm-2, 413. 66 kg hm-2, and 7278.19 m3 hm-2, respectively, the theoretical economic benefit was the best. The N4P3W2 treatment is the optimal treatment."

Hence, we carried out a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial to investigate this issue. METHODS: Eligible participants were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 30) or the control (n = 30) groups to receive either jujube or a placebo for eight weeks. Subjects were provided with 30 g dried jujube powder or placebo and were asked to consume half of the powder at 10 a.m. and the rest at 4 p.m. Lipid profile, fasting blood glucose (FBG), waist circumference (WC), and blood pressure were evaluated as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes collected were mental health measures (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stress). RESULTS: Jujube consumption failed to decrease FBG, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure, as well as depression and anxiety scores (P > 0.05). However, the between-group comparison revealed a significant improvement in WC (- 3.98 vs. - 0.51, P = 0.01), triglyceride (TG) (- 24.96 vs. - 0.73, P = 0.03), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (2.83 vs. 0.40, P = 0.01) in the jujube group compared to the placebo. In addition, compared to the control group, jujube consumption led to a significant improvement in the score of stress (- 5.80 vs. - 2.86, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Jujube consumption only had beneficial effects on WC, TG, and HDL-C in subjects with MetS. However, the current study has methodological weaknesses in blinding and herb purity/potency testing, which should be addressed in future studies.",

The disinfection efficacy and quality of dried jujube used as the processing application object were also studied. The results indicated that the Weibull + Tail model performed better for spore inactivation curves at different voltages among various treatment times, and the spore cells were reduced by 4.05 log (cfu/mL) in spores suspension at 70 kV after 15 min of treatment. This disinfection impact was further supported by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, which showed that the integrity of the cell membrane was damaged, and the intracellular content leaked out after DBD-CAP treatment. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the treatment increased the relative conductivity of cells, and leakage of nucleic acids and proteins further supported the disinfection impact. Additionally, the growth and toxicity of surviving A. niger spores after treatment were also greatly reduced. When DBD-CAP was applied to disinfecting dried jujube, the spore number exhibited a 2.67 log cfu/g reduction after treatment without significant damage observed onto the quality (P > 0.05).",

This study aims to assess and contrast the cytotoxic, anti-metastatic, and apoptotic effects of Ziziphus jujube honey and commercial honey on MCF7 cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two honey samples, Ziziphus jujube (JH) and commercial honey (CH), were categorized into high and low groups based on their phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and diastase activity (PAD score). The viability and migration ability of MCF-7 cells treated with JH and CH were evaluated. Also, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was performed to assess the effect of the two honey samples on the expression of Bax, p53, p21 and Bcl-2 genes. JH had a total phenolic content of 606.4 ± 0.1 µg gallic acid equivalent/mg, while CH had a value of 112.1 ± 0.09 µg gallic acid equivalent/mg. The total antioxidant capacity of the two samples was compared. It was 203.5 ± 10.5µM/l in JH and 4.6 ± 10.5 µM/l in CH. In addition, JH had a diastatic activity of 524.1 ± 0.25 U/l, while CH had a value of 209.7 ± 0.56 U/l. According to the results, JH had a high PAD value, while CH had a low PAD value. Cell viability was measured using the results of the MTT assay. The results showed that JH inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells more strongly (IC50 of 170 ± 4.2 µg/ml) than CH (IC50 of 385.3 ± 4.5 µg/l). The scratch assay showed that treatment with JH decreased the migration rate of MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner compared to the CH and control groups. In addition, the results of q-PCR analysis showed significant upregulation of Bax, p53 and p21 genes and downregulation of Bcl-2 gene in the JH-treated group compared to the CH and control groups. CONCLUSION: These results showed that honey with an increased content of phenolic compounds, antioxidant capacity, and diastatic activity has anticancer properties by effectively suppressing tumor development. This suppression occurs via several mechanisms, including suppression of proliferation and metastasis, and promotion of apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. In our previous studies, we showed that wheat bran extract (WBE) reduced white matter damage in a rat VaD model and improved memory in a human clinical trial. However, starch gelatinization made the large-scale preparation of WBE difficult. To simplify the manufacturing process and increase efficacy, we attempted to find a decoction containing an optimum ratio of wheat bran, sliced citrus peel, and sliced jujube (WCJ). To find an optimal ratio, the cell survival of C6 (rat glioma) cultured under hypoxic conditions (1% O2) was measured, and apoptosis was assessed. To confirm the efficacies of the optimized WCJ for VaD, pupillary light reflex, white matter damage, and the activation of astrocytes and microglia were assessed in a rat model of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) causing chronic hypoperfusion. Using a combination of both searching the literature and cell survival experiments, we chose 6:2:1 as the optimal ratio of wheat bran to sliced citrus peel to sliced jujube to prepare WCJ. We showed that phytic acid contained only in wheat bran can be used as an indicator component for the quality control of WCJ. We observed in vitro that the WCJ treatment improved cell survival by reducing apoptosis through an increase in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. In the BCCAO experiments, the WCJ-supplemented diet prevented astrocytic and microglial activation, mitigated myelin damage in the corpus callosum and optic tract, and, consequently, improved pupillary light reflex at dosages over 100 mg/kg/day. The results suggest that the consumption of WCJ can prevent VaD by reducing white matter damage, and WCJ can be developed as a safe, herbal medicine to prevent VaD."

Although fermented jujube juice (FJJ) with lactic acid bacteria has been shown to be rich in polyphenols and have strong antioxidant properties, little is known about its anti-obesity properties. RESULTS: Untargeted metabolomics was employed to identify and analyze the differential metabolites between FJJ and raw jujube juice. A total of 431 metabolites belonging to diverse classes and with various functional active ingredients were quantitatively identified. The animal experiments results showed that FJJ administration for 13 weeks significantly inhibited high-fat-diet-induced body and epididymal adipose weight gain, and improved the serum lipid parameters in obese mice. Additionally, DNA-sequencing results revealed that FJJ treatment increased Akkermansia abundance in the gut and changed the composition of fecal microbiota by decreasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio and Helicobacter pylori abundance. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that FJJ contributes to regulating lipid accumulation and gut microbiota composition in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice, which helps to prevent obesity. Hence, FJJ has the potential to be a beneficial beverage for controlling obesity. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

METHODS: A total of 200, 25-week-old laying hens (Inshas strain) were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments including SLAE at 0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mL/kg, respectively. The average temperature-humidity index value was 26.69 during the experimental period. The SLAE contained saponin (0.045%), total flavonoid content of 17.9 mg of quercetin equivalent/ 100 g and overall antioxidant capacity concentration of 17.9 mg of ascorbic acid equivalent/100 g. RESULTS: The maximum final body weight (BW), BW gain, egg weight, number, and mass occurred at the level of SLAE7.5 inclusion. The egg quality was significantly higher in SLAE groups than in control, and overall, SLAE7.5 had the most favorable influence at 28 and 32 weeks. Liver and kidney function, as well as lipids profile, improved significantly by SLAE inclusion; the lowest concentrations of these parameters were in SLAE7.5 hens. Treatment with SLAE7.5 increased total antioxidant capacity and endogenous antioxidant enzymes compared to control, whereas no effect on superoxide dismutase was noticed. CONCLUSION: The addition of SLAE at 7.5 mL/kg diet improved egg laying performance and quality, metabolic profiles, and antioxidant status during hyperthermia conditions."

Here, the therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus)-fermented jujube juice (FJJ) and the possible mechanism against chronic liver injury (CLI) in mice are further studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: After the CCl4 -induced CLI mice are separately treated with L. acidophilus (LA), unfermented jujube juice (UFJJ), and FJJ, FJJ but not LA or UFJJ suppresses the liver index. By using H&E staining, immunofluorescence staining, RT-PCR, and western blotting, it is shown that LA, UFJJ, and FJJ intervention ameliorate hepatocyte necrosis, inhibit the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory (NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α) and fibrosis-associated factors (TGF-β1, LXRα, and MMP2). Also, FJJ displays significant protection against mucosal barrier damage in CLI mice. Among the three interventions, FJJ exhibits the best therapeutic effect, followed by UFJJ and LA. Furthermore, FJJ improves dysbiosis in CLI mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that FJJ exhibits a protective effect against CCl4 -induced CLI mice by inhibiting apoptosis and oxidative stress, regulating liver lipid metabolism, and improving gut microecology. Jujube juice fermentation with L. acidophilus can be a food-grade supplement in treating CLI and related liver diseases.",

Although near-freezing temperature (NFT) storage is commonly employed for preserving fresh fruit, its effectiveness is somewhat limited. Incorporating jujube polysaccharides was proposed to augment the preservative effect on apricots. Our findings demonstrated that the combined use of NFT and jujube polysaccharides can maintain fruit color, and effectively inhibit decay. Additionally, Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) quantitative proteomic technology was utilized to analyze protein variations in 'Diaogan' apricots during storage. This dual approach not only markedly lowered the activity of polyphenol cell wall-degrading enzymes (p < 0.05) but also revealed 1054 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), which are related to sugar and energy metabolism, stress response and defense, lipid metabolism, and cell wall degradation. The changes in DEPs indicated that the combined use of NFT and jujube polysaccharides could accelerate the conversion of malic acid to oxaloacetic acid and regulate antioxidant ability, potentially extending the storage lifespan of apricot fruit."

In this study, the effectiveness of Ziziphus jujube fruit syrup in combination with antihistamines was assessed in patients with CSU. METHODS: This double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in Shiraz between December 2019 and December 2020. 64 patients with CSU who had experienced hives for at least six weeks and did not respond to the usual treatments were enrolled in the study. They were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups using permuted block random allocation. For four weeks, the intervention group received 7.5 mL Ziziphus jujube syrup twice a day, while the control group received 7.5 mL simple jujube syrup twice a day. Both groups received cetirizine 10 mg every night. Urticaria activity score (UAS) and CU-Q2oL questionnaires were used to assess urticaria state and sleep quality before and after each week for four consecutive weeks. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 18, and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Before the intervention, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups' mean of UAS (P=0.490) and sleep quality (P=0.423). During the follow-up, UAS in the intervention group was significantly lower (P=0.001). Moreover, this difference was significant on the day 28 (P=0.046). During the follow-up, the quality of sleep in both groups improved significantly, and this improvement was more significant in the intervention group.

      "abstract": "In order to reduce sucrose content in jujube juice and prepare a jujube juice beverage rich in rare sugars, jujube juice was used as raw material for multienzyme catalysis in this study. The effects of single factors such as substrate, pH, DPE and L-RI addition ratio, enzyme treatment temperature, and metal ions on sucrose conversion and D-allulose formation in jujube juice were investigated. Changes in glucose, D-allulose, and D-allose contents in jujube juice before and after enzyme conversion were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that 'Xiangfenmuzao' was more suitable for subsequent double enzyme coupling reactions in different varieties of jujube juice at different periods. Factors such as pH, DPE and L-RI enzyme ratio, temperature, and treatment time had significant effects on sucrose conversion and D-allulose production in 'Xiangfenmuzao' juice (p < 0.05). When the ratio of DPE and L-RI was 1:10, pH was 7.5, and the temperature was 60 °C for 7 h, the fructose content in the full-red stage jujube juice of 'Xiangfenmuzao' and 'Jinsixiaozao' decreased gradually, and the final yield was about 53%. The yield of D-allulose was about 29%, and the yield of D-allulose was about 17%. In this study, DPE and L-RI were used to treat whole red jujube juice, which could effectively reduce sucrose content in jujube juice and obtain a functional jujube juice beverage that is low in calories and rich in rare sugar."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of radio frequency (RF) heat treatment on heat and mass transfer during the hot air drying of jujube slices. Experiments were conducted at different drying stages, comparing single-hot air drying with hot air combined with RF treatment. Numerical models using COMSOL Multiphysics® were developed to simulate the process, and the results were compared to validate the models. The maximum difference between the simulated value of the center temperature and the experimental value was 6.9 °C, while the minimum difference was 0.1 °C. The maximum difference in average surface temperature was 1.7 °C, with a minimum of 0.3 °C. The determination coefficient (R2) between the simulated experimental values of HA and the early (E-HA + RF), middle (M-HA + RF), and later (L-HA + RF) groups was 0.964, 0.987, 0.961, and 0.977, respectively. The study demonstrates that RF treatment reduces drying time, enhances internal temperature, promotes consistent heat and mass transfer, and accelerates moisture diffusion in jujube slices. Furthermore, the later the RF treatment is applied, the greater the increase in internal temperature and the faster the decrease in moisture content. This research elucidates the mechanism by which RF heat treatment influences heat transfer in hot air-dried jujube slices."

      "abstract": "Although Ziziphus jujuba Mill (jujube) is used in folk medicine for hypnotic sedative, anxiolytic, and many other purposes, to date, only a few studies have revealed its sleep-promoting effects and related mechanisms. Currently, drugs used for the treatment of sleep disorders have various side effects, so it is essential to develop safe natural materials. Therefore, we evaluated the sleep-enhancing activity and mechanism of action of an aqueous extract of jujube seeds (ZW) fermented with Lactobacillus brevis L-32 in rodent models. The starch contained in ZW was removed by enzymatic degradation and fermented with L. brevis to obtain a fermented product (ZW-FM) with a high γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content. To evaluate the sleep-promoting effect of ZW-FM, pentobarbital-induced sleep tests were performed on ICR mice, and electroencephalography analysis was undertaken in Sprague Dawley rats. Additionally, the awakening relief effects of ZW-FM were confirmed in a caffeine-induced insomnia model. Finally, the mechanism of sleep enhancement by ZW-FM was analyzed using GABA receptor type A (GABAA) antagonists. The ZW-FM-treated groups (100 and 150 mg/kg) showed increased sleep time, especially the δ-wave time during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In addition, the 150 mg/kg ZW-FM treatment group showed decreased sleep latency and increased sleep time in the insomnia model. In particular, NREM sleep time was increased and REM sleep time, which was increased by caffeine treatment, was decreased by ZW-FM treatment. ZW-FM-induced sleep increase was inhibited by the GABAA receptor antagonists picrotoxin, bicuculline, and flumazenil, confirming that the increase was the result of a GABAergic mechanism. These results strongly suggest that the increased GABA in water extract from jujube seeds fermented by L. brevis acts as a sleep-promoting compound and that the sleep-promoting activity is related to GABAA receptor binding."

However, its significance in acute lung injury (ALI) has never been studied. The present study aimed to explore whether Z.J could attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in an experimental model of ALI. Male BALB/c mice received an intratracheal administration of LPS (n=32) or phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (control, n=8). Within 1, 11, and 23 h post-LPS injection, mice were randomly assigned to receive intraperitoneal treatments of saline, dexamethasone (2 mg/kg), and 100 and 200 mg/kg of Z.J extracts, respectively. 24 h after intratracheal administration of LPS, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues were harvested and assessed for inflammatory cell influx, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels, and histological assessments. Treatment with Z.J extracts (100 and 200 mg/kg) and dexamethasone effectively reduced LPS-induced neutrophil and other inflammatory cell influx into the lung tissue compared to the untreated group. additionally, both doses of Z.J extracts (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the lung wet-to-dry ratio and histopathological damage. Furthermore, compared to the untreated ALI mice, Z.J extract at the highest dose could significantly reduce the TNF-α level.   The present findings indicated that Z.J could effectively ameliorate LPS-induced ALI inflammatory responses and might be considered a promising alternative therapy for the ALI phenotype.",

Huping) stored at 0 ± 1 °C for 90 days. The results showed that the fruits treated with AEW + HVEF exhibited better storage quality than those treated with either AEW or HVEF alone. Specifically, the fruits treated with AEW + HVEF maintained higher levels of nutrients and taste compounds, including total soluble solid (TSS), total soluble sugar, reducing sugar and titratable acidity (TA), as well as lower respiration rate, weight loss, decay index and TSS/TA ratio. Additionally, the AEW + HVEF treatment could delay the increase in reddening index, a* and color change (ΔE) values, and the decrease in L* and b* values, by retarding the degradation of chlorophyll and accumulation of carotenoids and flavonoids, thereby preserving the more desirable appearance color. Furthermore, the combined treatment could enhance the glutathione reductase (GR) activity and 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothizoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) +-scavenging ability. Thus, the AEW + HVEF treatment is a potential method for Huping jujube preservation."

Tetracycline derivatives treatments have been validated to be capable of recovering jujube trees from phytoplasma infection. In this study, we reported that oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC-HCl) trunk injection treatment could recover more than 86% of mild JWB-diseased trees. In order to explore the underlying molecular mechanism, comparative transcriptomic analysis of healthy control (C group), JWB-diseased (D group) and OTC-HCl treated JWB-diseased (T group) jujube leaves was performed. In total, 755 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 488 in 'C vs. D', 345 in 'D vs. T' and 94 in 'C vs. T', were identified. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs were mainly involved in DNA and RNA metabolisms, signaling, photosynthesis, plant hormone metabolism and transduction, primary and secondary metabolisms, their transportations, etc. Notably, most of the DEGs identified in 'C vs. D' displayed adverse change patterns in 'D vs. T', suggesting that the expression of these genes was restored after OTC-HCl treatment. Our study revealed the influences of JWB phytoplasma infection and OTC-HCl treatment on gene expression profiling in jujube and would be helpful for understanding the chemotherapy effects of OTC-HCl on JWB-diseased jujube.",

Jujube vinegar lowers lipids, protects the liver, and reduces oxidant capacity, however, it is unknown whether this is due to the gut flora. To further research the role of the gut microbiome in treating hyperlipidemia with jujube vinegar, we looked into whether the action of jujube vinegar is related to the regulation of the gut microbiome. METHOD: Thirty male ICR mice were used. The control group (CON), the high-fat diet (HFD) group, and the vinegar group (VIN) each consisted of ten female ICR mice fed consistently for eight weeks. For each treatment, we kept track of body mass, liver index, blood lipid levels, and oxidative stress state. We also analyzed mouse feces using high-throughput 16srRNA sequencing to examine the relationship between jujube vinegar's hypolipidemic effect and antioxidant activity and how it affects the gut microbiome. RESULTS: Jujube vinegar reduced body weight by 19.92%, serum TC, TG, and LDL-C by 25.09%, 26.83%, and 11.66%, and increased HDL-C by 1.44 times, serum AST and ALT decreased by 26.36% and 34.87% respectively, the blood levels of SOD and GSH-Px increased 1.35-fold and 1.60-fold, respectively. While blood MDA decreased 33.21%, the liver's SOD and GSH-Px increased 1.32-fold and 1.60-fold, respectively, and the liver's MDA decreased 48.96% in HFD mice. The gut microbiome analysis revealed that jujube vinegar increased the intestinal microbial ASV count by 13.46%, and the F/B (Firmicutes/Bacteroidota) ratio by 2.08-fold in high-fat diet mice, and the proportion was significantly inversely correlated with TC, TG, and LDL-C and positively correlated with HDL-C. Biomarker bacteria in the vinegar group included Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillus, which correlated favorably with HDL-C, SOD, and GSH-Px and negatively with LDL-C, TC, and TG. Jujube vinegar increased the abundance of the Aerobic, Contains Mobile Elements, and Facultative Aerobic by 2.84 times, 1.45 times, and 2.40 times, while decreased the abundance of Potential pathogens by 44.72%, according to the BugBase study. The KEGG analysis showed that jujube vinegar was predominantly reflected in the biological process of gene function and related to signal transduction pathways, including glucagon signaling system, HIF-1 signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, amino sugar, and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and so forth. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, jujube vinegar may reduce hyperlipoidemia by controlling the gut microbiome and enhancing antioxidant capacity."

Herein, four different disease-controlling agents (chlorothalonil, CuCl2, harpin and melatonin) were separately applied to fresh jujube fruit, and all improved postharvest quality (evaluated by disease severity, antioxidant accumulation and senescence) relative to controls. Disease severity was drastically inhibited by these agents, in the order chlorothalonil > CuCl2 > harpin > melatonin. However, chlorothalonil residues were detected even after storage for 4 weeks. These agents increased the activities of defense enzymes including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, polyphenol oxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase, as well as accumulation of antioxidant compounds such as ascorbic acid, glutathione, flavonoids and phenolics, in postharvest jujube fruit. The enhanced antioxidant content and antioxidant capacity (evaluated by Fe3+ reducing power) was ordered melatonin > harpin > CuCl2 > chlorothalonil. All four agents significantly delayed senescence (evaluated by weight loss, respiration rate and firmness), with the effect ordered CuCl2 > melatonin > harpin > chlorothalonil. Moreover, treatment with CuCl2 also increased copper accumulation ~ threefold in postharvest jujube fruit. Among the four agents, postharvest treatment with CuCl2 could be considered most appropriate for improving postharvest jujube fruit quality under low temperature conditions without sterilization.",

In this study, the antifungal effects and the mechanism of action of surfactin on the fungus Botrytis cinerea were investigated. The effects of applying surfactin for the removal of gray mold on the quality of winter jujube were investigated based on the changes in fruit fatty acids. The results showed that (1) surfactin significantly inhibited the growth of B. cinerea, the EC50 at 5 d was 46.42 mg/L. (2) Surfactin significantly reduced the disease incidence and diameter of gray mold-inoculated winter jujube in a concentration-dependent manner. For that treated with surfactin at the EC50, the incidence decreased by 38.89%. (3) For B. cinerea under surfactin treatment, the mycelial morphology changed, the levels of total lipids and ergosterol decreased, the reactive oxygen species levels increased, and the cell integrity was completely damaged. (4) For winter jujube inoculated by B. cinerea, the contents of saturated fatty acids decreased and unsaturated fatty acids increased. For those under the surfactin treatments, winter jujube maintained the fatty acid composition at the level of non-inoculated groups. Mechanical injury significantly changed the fatty acid composition of winter jujube; however, surfactin not only was able to inhibit the growth of gray mold but also mitigated the adverse effects from mechanical injury. The present study demonstrated the potential applications of surfactin in the preservation of postharvest fruit quality."

      "abstract": "Whereas vaccination is established as one of the most effective and available methods against seasonal flu and holds high potential for many infectious diseases, immune response may differ among individuals and regions. In this study we examined the effects of gut microbiota on vaccination with human serum albumin (HSA) as the model vaccine in C57BL/6J mice. We observed that a two-week antibiotic cocktail (ABX) treatment hampered HSA-specific IgG1 in serum, whereas fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restored the gut microbiota impaired by the ABX treatment and consequently increased the proportions of macrophages in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), plasma cells in the peripheral blood, and HSA-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) in the serum. A week of daily application of jujube powder (800 mg/kg) to ABX-treated mice achieved a significantly higher HSA-specific IgG1 concentration in the serum compared with the ABX treatment group. Of particular note was that the administration of the jujube powder did not increase the myeloid cells, indicating a different mechanism of vaccination compared with FMT. More interestingly, daily pre-administration of jujube powder (800 mg/kg) to healthy mice one week ahead of vaccination boosted their immune response, as evidenced by the proportion of macrophages in the MLNs, B cells in the spleen, plasma cells and memory B cells in the peripheral blood, and HSA-specific IgG1 concentration in the serum. The 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota revealed that the administration of jujube powder increased the abundance of Coriobacteriaceae associated with the metabolism of amino acids. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis suggested the altered microbiota is more favorable for arginine and proline metabolism, which may promote macrophages in the MLNs. These results indicate a high potential for boosting vaccination by manipulating gut microbiota with natural products.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, broiler production is faced with great challenges due to intensive culture modes, and chickens are more susceptible to oxidative stress. Consequently, synthetic antioxidants have been used to reduce this process, but their use has shown potential health risks. Thus, the use of natural ingredients has been suggested as a strategy to prevent oxidative stress. This study investigated how dietary dried jujube fruit powder (DJFP) supplementation influences the growth performance, antioxidant stability, meat composition, and nutritional quality of Cobb broilers. A total of 360 unsexed broilers (1-day-old) were randomly assigned to treatments that varied in DJFP levels: a basal diet without DJFP (control) and diets supplemented with 50 g/kg DJFP (P1), 100 g/kg DJFP (P2), and 150 g/kg DJFP (P3), with 9 replicates per treatment (90 broilers/treatment or 10 broilers/replicate). The results demonstrated improvement in the growth performance of broilers in terms of body weight (BW), body weight gain (WG), average daily body weight gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) following dietary DJFP supplementation. In addition, the antioxidant stabilities in the DJFP-treated broilers were improved and inhibited the production of lipid oxidation products compared with the control, with those in the P2 group showing the most marked effect. Moreover, dietary DJFP supplementation significantly increased (p < 0.05) the activity of antioxidant enzymes in broilers. Furthermore, the breast meat of the broilers displayed an increased protein content with a simultaneous reduction in the fat content after DJFP treatment (p < 0.05). Essential amino acid levels were higher in the DJFP-supplemented groups (p < 0.05). The sum of saturated fatty acids was lower, and that of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and the polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid ratio (PUFA/SFA) were higher in the DJFP-supplemented groups (p < 0.05). Together, these results indicate that up to 100 g/kg of dietary DJFP supplementation can enhance the growth performance and antioxidant capacity, meat composition, and amino acid and fatty acid composition in broiler breast meat. In conclusion, dietary DJFP supplementation is a healthy alternative to the use of synthetic antioxidants in broiler production, especially in regions rich in jujube resources."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of a combination of acidic electrolyzed water (AEW) and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on the quality of jujube stored at 1 ± 0.5°C for 40 days. Jujube was treated with AEW + MAP, AEW, and MAP, respectively, to identify an appropriate preservation method based on the changes of quality indicators, activities of antioxidant enzymes and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and cell membrane permeability. Results showed that the combined treatment maintained higher storage quality of jujube than the other three treatments. The combined treatment significantly suppressed softening, weight, and color loss and maintained total soluble solid and titratable acidity. Moreover, the combined treatment improved antioxidant capacity showing high levels of nonenzymatic antioxidant systems (ascorbic acid and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity), and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase). These effects remarkably suppressed the increase of MDA level and cell membrane permeability, thereby inhibiting oxidative damage and alleviating quality deterioration. Furthermore, kinetic model indicated that AEW + MAP decreased rate constant of quality deterioration. Principal component analysis also showed that AEW + MAP treatment alleviated quality deterioration, with higher comprehensive score than other treatments. In summary, AEW + MAP was an effective preservation method to maintain storage quality and delay postharvest senescence of jujube. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, a combination of acidic electrolyzed water (AEW) with modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) has been found to have effective preservation effects on jujube. AEW + MAP treatment improved quality of jujube during cold storage mainly by enhancing antioxidant capacity. The combined treatment may provide a new preservation technology for jujube.",

To investigate the effects of glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine; GB) treatment on the quality of postharvest jujubes, fresh winter jujubes (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv.

The results showed that GB application can effectively maintain cell wall component content by restraining gene expression and enzyme activities, including PG, CX, PME and β-Glu. Meanwhile, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (APX, CAT, SOD, POD) and the contents of nonenzymatic antioxidants (MDA, H2O2, ASA, GSH) were enhanced in treated jujubes, thereby reducing the content of ROS. In addition, energy metabolism enzyme activities (H+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, SDH and CCO) and gene expression were also significantly increased, thus maintaining higher energy levels (ATP, ADP, AMP and EC). In summary, GB enhances ATP biosynthesis by increasing energy metabolism. It offers essential energy for the antioxidant metabolism, thus retarding the softening of postharvest jujubes.",

The dried red jujube fruit extract has the potential to protect the liver from toxic substances through its antioxidant properties. Aims To determine and analyze the hepatoprotective effect of dried red jujube fruit extract on aminotransferase levels against acetaminophen-induced acute hepatotoxicity. Methods Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups. The negative control group (G1) received carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) 1%. The positive control group (G2) received acetaminophen. The treatment group G3 received dried red jujube fruit extract 70 mg/kg BW + acetaminophen, G4 received dried red jujube fruit extract 140 mg/kg BW + acetaminophen, and G5 received dried red jujube fruit extract 280 mg/kg BW + acetaminophen. Dried red jujube fruit extract was given for 10 consecutive days. Acetaminophen (3 g/kg BW) was given on the ninth day. Blood samples were collected, and aminotransferase levels were measured on the 11th day. Results Kruskal-Wallis comparison test showed significant differences (p < 0.01) between all groups on alanine aminotransferase (ALT; p = 0.003) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; p = 0.001) levels. Mann-Whitney post hoc test showed significant differences (p < 0.01) between G2:G3, G2:G4, and G2:G5 groups on ALT and AST levels. Pearson correlation test showed a significant negative correlation (p < 0.01; r = -1) between all given doses of dried red jujube fruit extract on ALT (p = 0.000; r = -0.778) and AST (p = 0.000; r = -0.774) levels. Conclusion The dried red jujube fruit extract has a hepatoprotective effect on aminotransferase levels against acetaminophen-induced acute hepatotoxicity at 70 mg/kg BW, 140 mg/kg BW, and 280 mg/kg BW (the most effective dose), and there was a negative correlation between all doses and the aminotransferase levels."

The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the yeast Meyerozyma caribbica in controlling A. alternata in postharvest jujube fruits, and to explore the biofilm formation mechanism. The results showed that M. caribbica treatment significantly reduced the A. alternata decay in jujube fruits. M. caribbica could rapidly colonize jujube fruit wounds, adhering tightly to hyphae of A. alternata, and accompanied by the production of extracellular secretions. In in vitro experiments, we identified that M. caribbica adhered to polystyrene plates, indicating a strong biofilm-forming ability. Furthermore, we demonstrated that M. caribbica can secrete phenylethanol, a quorum sensing molecule which can affect biofilm development. Phenylalanine (a precursor substance for phenylethanol synthesis) enhanced the secretion of phenylethanol and promoted the formation of M. caribbica biofilms. Meanwhile, phenylalanine enhanced the biological control performance of M. caribbica against jujube black spot rot. Our study provided new insights that enhance the biological control performance of antagonistic yeast."

In this study, changes in epidermal wax morphology, composition, and genes regulation induced by heat shock (HT), 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) or their combination (HT + 1-MCP) were investigated in jujube fruit during cold storage. HT, 1-MCP, or HT + 1-MCP caused a smoother wax layer and fewer micro-cracks compared to the control (CK) during cold storage. It was confirmed that acids and terpenoids were the main wax components by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

The transcriptomics results indicated that HT + 1-MCP treatment up-regulated FATB, FATB, FAB2, FAD2 and CYP716A, and maintained the wax content of jujube fruit during cold storage.

In this study, 'Lingwu long' jujubes were treated with UV-C (5 kJ m-2) to investigate the impacts of cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) activities, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, and phenylpropanoid metabolism under storage at 4 ± 1 °C for 30 d. UV-C treatment reduced respiration rate and decay index. Treated fruit exhibited lower polygalacturonase (PG), pectinate lyases (PL), cellulase (Cel), and β-galactosidase (β-gal) activities which ultimately delayed the reduction of firmness. UV-C treatment increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), free radical scavenging ability, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, reduced superoxide anion (O2-) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. In addition, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) activities were activated by UV-C treatment, leading to glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid (AsA) increased. Besides, phenolic compounds of jujube fruit treated with UV-C were also increased, which might be due to the enhanced phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) activities. In conclusion, UV-C was recommended for improving overall quality and alleviating senescence in jujube fruit.",

In this study, the ultrasonic-assisted extraction conditions of sour jujube were optimized. A five-level central composite design (CCD) with four variables was used to evaluate ultrasonic treatment variables influencing the total saponin content (TSC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total phenolic content (TPC) extracted from sour jujube. The solvent concentration, extraction time, ultrasonic power, and solid-to-liquid (S/L) ratio were optimized using aqueous ethanol and methanol solutions as extraction solvents. A central composite design (CCD) was used for an in-depth study, and then the optimal value that could produce the maximum TPC, TFC, TSC, and four in vitro antioxidant activities (scavenging activity of hydroxyl free radicals, ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), phosphomolybdic acid reduction method, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity) was determined. Hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress experiment confirmed that the Jujube extract could have an antioxidant role in vivo. The relationship between the contents of three compounds and the antioxidant activity in vitro and in vivo was further studied. The results showed that optimizing methanol and ethanol extraction process parameters could improve target components' extraction efficiency. Under the optimum conditions, the TFC and TPC yields of sour jujube by ethanol are better than methanol, while the yield of TSC by methanol is better than ethanol. In vivo data showed that Jujube extract protects against the adverse effects of oxidative stress and improves the life span of female and male Drosophila. This study provides a valuable reference for the full use of Ziziphus jujube, as well as a new direction in food development."

Hg2+ can decrease the fluorescence intensity of the CDs through static quenching, while the addition of oxalic acid (OA) recovers it owing to the coordination binding between oxalic acid and Hg2+. Based on this, the as-prepared CDs were used as a new \"off-on\" fluorescent probe for highly sensitive determination of oxalic acid with a wide linear detection range of 0.1-20 mg L-1 and a low detection limit of 0.057 mg L-1. Moreover, the fluorescent probe was successfully applied to detect oxalic acid in tomato and cherry tomato samples with satisfactory results."

The mulching treatments included clean tillage (CT, control treatment), jujube branches mulching (JBM), and white clover planting (WCP). The results revealed that: (1) The average soil moisture content of JBM was greater than that of CT by 3.76% and 2.34%, respectively, during the 2013 and 2014 jujube growth periods, and its soil water deficit was minimal in each soil layer from 0 to 70 cm. WCP had the greatest soil water deficit. The average soil moisture content of the 0−70 cm soil layer in WCP was 3.88% and 5.55% lower than that in CT during the 2013 and 2014 jujube growth seasons, respectively (p < 0.05). (2) JBM had the highest annual average soil moisture content in each soil layer from 0 to 70 cm, followed by CT, while WCP had the lowest. White clover and jujube competed for water in the 20−40 cm soil layer, and JBM had the lowest variation in soil moisture. (3) Mulching with jujube branches and planting white clover could both control the temperature of the 0−25 cm soil layer and narrow the daily temperature range, with JBM being the least affected by air temperature. (4) Jujube’s leaf area index and stem diameter increase in JBM were both significantly greater than in CT and WCP. In conclusion, using pruned jujube branches as surface mulch is appropriate for rain-fed jujube orchards because it can preserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and promote jujube growth."

Hot air drying has been commercially and typically used to prolong shelf life and acquire the dried produce. Jujube slices were dried with hot air combined with radio frequency (RF) at different drying stages, namely, early (0-2 h, E-HA + RF), middle (2-4 h, M-HA + RF), later (4-6 h, L-HA + RF), and whole (0-6 h, W-HA + RF) stages. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different RF application stages on the microstructure, moisture absorption rate, color, and ascorbic acid of jujube slices. Compared with the hot air drying (HA) group, the E-HA + RF group obtained the best results among the experimental groups because it reduced the cells with a roundness of less than 0.4 by 5%. Moreover, the M-HA + RF group showed better results than those of other groups, with an 18.6% and 48.8% reduction in cells for a cross-sectional area less than 200 µm2 and a perimeter less than 25 µm, respectively. The minimum total color difference (ΔE = 9.21 ± 0.31) and maximum retention of ascorbic acid (285.06 mg/100 g) were also observed in this group. Therefore, the method of hot air drying assisted by phased RF is viable in the drying industry to improve the quality of dried agricultural products and reduce energy consumption."

In this study, swertisin was extracted by ultrasound-assisted extraction method optimized with Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology. The antioxidant effect of swertisin was determined in vitro and in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Furthermore, the potential mechanisms of its antioxidant stress were comprehensively evaluated and explored with network pharmacology and molecular docking technology. The results showed obvious scavenging ability of swertisin on free radical and swertisin (50, 250, and 500 μmol/L) significantly enhanced antioxidative enzymes activity (GST-4, SOD-3, and GSH-PX ) and reduced the reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde accumulation in C. elegans, thereby protecting them from oxidative stress (heat stress and hydrogen peroxide). A total of 139 antioxidant targets of swertisin were screened and 70 signal pathways were enriched, including cancer-related pathways, lipid metabolism, liver injury-related pathways, acute lung injury, nervous system diseases, etc. This study provides the basis for further investigation on the antioxidant stress mechanism and contributes to the development of relevant drugs from natural products. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The imbalance between the antioxidant defense system and reactive oxygen species is one of the main causes of neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and aging. Therefore, alleviating oxidative stress injury has become a common strategy, which is helpful for the multi-target treatment of related diseases. The flavonoid of sour Jujube seed possesses potential antioxidant activity with multiple food health effects. From this study results, we optimized ultrasound-assisted extraction method for extracting the swertisin from sour Jujube seed and supported the use of C. elegans as an in vivo experimental model. We can recommend that the swertisin as a natural ingredient has a positive effect on antioxidation, which provided a scientific basis for treating related diseases through relevant pharmacological mechanisms and making antiaging functional food formula.",

The results showed that the growth ability of L. plantarum in jujube juice was not affected by different sterilization treatments. After SA and PS treatment, the particle size of jujube juice increased by 440.51% and 222.29%, respectively, and the reducing sugar content decreased by 33.83% and 24.51%, respectively. Compared with SA and PS, PLS and CPS were beneficial to improve the stability of jujube juice, and tartaric acid content in jujube juice was significantly increased after CPS treatment. There was no significant difference in sensory and nutritional quality between PLS treated jujube juice and control, and the color of PLS treated jujube juice was significantly better than that of the other three sterilization treatments. The research indicated that PLS treatment could be a prospective sterilization method applied in the processing of fermented jujube juice.

Changes in the structure (surface hydrophobicity, secondary structure, and tertiary structure), functional properties (solubility, turbidity, emulsifying, and foaming characteristics), and gel properties (gel strength, springiness, and water-holding capacity) of the MPs of white feather broiler, which were fed with different concentrations of selenium yeast or/and jujube powder (selenium yeast: 0,0.3, and 0.6 mg/kg; jujube powder: 8% to replace corn) for 42 days, were determined at 0, 24, and 72 h post-mortem. The results showed that with increasing concentrations of selenium yeast and jujube powder in the diet, the α-helix content, solubility, emulsification, and foaming of post-mortem chicken MP increased significantly (P < 0.05). The gel strength, springiness, and water-holding capacity of MP also increased, but the differences between the treatment groups were not significant (P > 0.05). In addition, the β-folding content and turbidity of MP decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Both the increase in selenium yeast levels and the addition of jujube powder improved the structural integrity and functional properties of MP. The best improvement effect was found in the combination group of high-dose selenium yeast and jujube powder, and there were significant interactions between them in the indices of α-helix, β-folding, turbidity, emulsification, and foam stability of MP. In conclusion, supplementing diets with seleniumyeast and jujube powder could maintain the structural stability of MPs in post-mortem chicken breast, leading to good functional properties. The results of this study may provide new insights into the effects of pre-slaughter feeding on post-mortem muscle MP conformation control and quality improvement."

      "abstract": "The ecological environment of the hilly and gully area of the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi is fragile and the soil fertility is low. As a result, the yield and quality of Pear-jujube which constitute one of the dominant economic forests in this region, have been severely restricted. At present, the scientific application of fertilizer is important for comprehensively improving the quality of fruit trees, and for devising the optimal management of fruit trees. In particular, the application of organic fertilizers plays an important role in improving soil and improving fruit quality. In this experiment, a field study was conducted to understand the effects of different organic fertilizer applications on physiological growth, photosynthetic characteristics, reproductive growth and nutritional quality of Pear-jujube in the Loess Plateau. The results showed that organic fertilizer significantly promoted the physiological growth of Pear-jujube. The Pear-jujube bearing branch and leaf area under the soybean cake fertilizer (SC) treatment were 20.17 cm and 1246 mm2/leaf, respectively, which are increased by 34% and 44.46% compared with the no fertilizer treatment, which was a control check (CK). The total chlorophyll content of fertilization treatment was significantly higher than that of CK (P < 0.05). The maximum of chlorophyll content was 10.90 mg/dm2 under the biogas fertilizer (BM). The content of LAI was in the order BM > conventional fertilizer (CF) > sheep manure (SM) > SC > CK. The changing trend of gap fraction was opposite to that of LAI, and the density of light was consistent with that of LAI. The density of light BM was the largest, reached 38.06 mol/(m2 d), which was 15.13% higher than that of CK. Organic fertilizer significantly improved the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and water use efficiency (WUEp) of Pear-jujube. The WUEp of SC was up to 3.30%. Organic fertilizer significantly promoted the reproductive growth and improved the nutritional quality of Pear-jujube. The yield under the SC was 19,177 kg/hm2, increased by 138.5% compared with that of CK. The fruit water content (FWC), total soluble solids (TSS), solid-acid ratio (TSS/TA), Vc and total flavonoids content improved, and the maxima of FWC, TSS, TSS/TA, Vc and total flavonoids content under the SC treatment were 86.30%, 18.48%, 40.17, 46.18 mg/kg and 14.35 mg/kg, respectively, which were significantly different from those of CK (P < 0.05). Organic fertilization effectively promotes the growth, development, yield and fruit quality of Pear-jujube in the Loess Plateau and the effect of the soybean cake fertilizer is the most significant.",

Nevertheless, jujube is perishable by microbial contamination and has a short shelf life under non-controlled conditions. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) presents a great potential for food sterilization, maintain postharvest quality, and prolonged storage time. Herein, this study investigated the potential effect of CAP with different exposure times (0, 5, 10, and 20 min) on the physicochemical and biochemical changes in jujube during 15-day storage at 4°C and 90% relative humidity (RH). The results showed that CAP treatment could obviously delay ripening, but displayed no effects on the speed of weight loss and moisture content. Meanwhile, the total native aerobic bacterial count in each jujube group was restrained during whole storage. However, CAP treatment showed a time-dependent manner to improve gene expression (PAL, 4CL, DFR, ANS, LAR, and ANR) related to phenolic biosynthesis. As compared to other groups, 20-min CAP treatment can keep or increase total phenolic content (TPC), maintain antioxidant activity, and reduce oxidative damage. Furthermore, the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in jujube during middle storage were visibly reduced by 20-min CAP treatment. All in all, our findings concluded that appropriate CAP exposure time can be a promising candidate for the postharvest preservation of jujube."

Chinese jujube is a native fruit tree in China, which is also an admittedly drought-resistant plant. But the drought-related miRNAs have little been reported in jujube. OBJECTIVE: To identify possibly drought-responsive microRNAs and their target genes in Chinese Jujube. METHODS: Twelve small RNA libraries were constructed from two jujube genotypes both drought treated and control samples with three replicates to identify known and novel miRNAs in Chinese Jujube, DESeq2 was used to identify expression pattern of miRNAs between drought treatment and control samples, TargetFinder program was used to predict potential target genes of conserved and novel miRNAs, RT-qPCR were used to analysis the expression levels of drought-related miRNAs and their potential targets. The RNA ligase-mediated RLM-5' RACE experiments were performed to validate predicted target genes of drought-related miRNAs. RESULTS: 43 known miRNAs and 431 novel miRNAs were identified in Chinese jujube. Expression analysis showed that 28 miRNAs were differential expressed under drought stress in jujube variety \"Dongzao\", including 21 up-regulated miRNAs and 7 down-regulated miRNAs, 61 miRNAs were differential expressed under drought stress in Chinese jujube variety \"Zanhuangdazao\", including 23 up-regulated miRNAs and 37 down-regulated miRNAs. Depend on miRNAs target prediction, functional annotation and expression analysis, we identified 9 drought-related miRNAs, and 7 target genes of 6 miRNAs were confirmed using the modified 5'-RACE method. Also, RT-qPCR analyses revealed that relative expression of those miRNAs and their targets have negative tendency. CONCLUSION: We identified 6 drought-related miRNAs by high-throughout sequencing and target gene annotation from Chinese jujube, and targets of those miRNAs were confirmed by the modified 5'-RACE method. These findings provide molecular evidence for enhancing drought tolerance in Chinese jujube and other plants.",

Winter jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Miller cv. Dongzao) is a unique fruit resource with high edible and commercial value in China, while postharvest decay has always been a severe problem leading to short shelf life and poor quality of fruit. Ozone treatment is regarded as one of the most effective means to control decay and extend shelf life because of its cost-effective and eco-friendly properties. In the present study, three concentrations of ozone (2.5, 5 and 10 μL L-1) were found to reduce significantly postharvest decay of winter jujube on days 10 and 15, which were produced from Huanghua City, Hebei, China. High-throughput sequencing revealed significant changes in the bacterial and fungal communities in response to the application of ozone treatment, while Didymella, Rhizopus, Alternaria, Phialemoniopsis and Mycosphaerella were found to be the most abundant in fungi, and Methylobacterium, Pseudomonas, Pantoea, Sphingomonas and Gluconobacter being the most abundant in bacteria. Results of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) indicated that ozone treatments considerably reduced the abundance of Rhizopus and Gluconobacter on the surface of winter jujube fruit. Furthermore, Pearson correlation analysis showed that Rhizopus was positively correlated with Gluconobacter (r = 0.97) while negatively correlated with Didymella (r = -0.96). By predicting the metabolic function, ozone may inhibit metabolic pathways including nucleoside and nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, fatty acid and lipid degradation, respiration, and electron transfer, thereby reducing the incidence of fruit decay and maintaining the firmness of winter jujube fruit.",

In this study, the ultra-high pressure extraction (UHPE) conditions for obtaining the maximum cAMP yield from jujube were optimized. Orthogonal array design (OAD) was applied to evaluate the effects of three variables (pressure, pressure-holding time, and liquid-to-solid ratio) by UHPE on cAMP yield. The results showed that the optimal cAMP yield (1223.2 μg/g) was derived at 300 MPa, 20 min duration, and a liquid-to-solid ratio of 2.5 ml/g. In addition, as an important functional ingredient in jujube, cAMP has potential anti-allergic effect. To develop the functional characteristics of jujube, the effect of cAMP was characterized in vivo with the Balb/c mouse model of peanut allergy, which was established by subcutaneous injection of crude peanut protein extract (PN). The results showed that treatment with cAMP in PN-sensitized mice suppressed the lesions in jejunal tissues and allergic symptoms and restored spleen index. Meanwhile, cAMP treatment reduced serum levels of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), histamine, as well as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and stimulated the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), whereas the serum levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) were not affected. Our results suggested that cAMP has an anti-allergic effect in PN-sensitized mice."

      "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been identified as an important gaseous signal molecule in plants. Here, we investigated the effects of H2S on postharvest senescence and antioxidant metabolism of Lingwu Long Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba cv. Mill) fruits (LLJF). Fumigation of Jujube fruits with H2S released from 0.4 mm NaHS could significantly prolong the postharvest shelf life of jujube fruits, reduce the decay rate of fruit, the weight loss of fruit, and inhibit the fruit loss, hardness, color, soluble solids, and titratable acidity. Compared with the control group, exogenous H2S fumigation significantly decreased the loss of chlorophyll, carotenoids, soluble protein, ascorbic acid, phenols, and flavonoids in jujube fruits during post-harvest storage. At the same time, H2S could significantly delay the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2 ∙-) and promote catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD) activity, and inhibit polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity. To summarize, H2S can effectively alleviate postharvest senescence and decay of jujube fruits by regulating the ROS accumulation and antioxidant enzymes, and prolong the storage period of postharvest."

      "abstract": "Jujube cores are fiber-rich industrial waste. Dewaxing, alkali treatment, bleaching, and sulfuric acid hydrolysis were used to generate cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from the jujube cores in this study. The morphological, structural, crystallinity, and thermal properties of the fibers were investigated using FE-SEM, TEM, AFM, FT-IR, XRD, and TGA under various processes. CNCs’ zeta (ζ) potential and water contact angle (WAC) were also investigated. The findings demonstrate that non-fibrous components were effectively removed, and the fiber particles shrunk over time because of many activities. CNCs had a rod-like shape, with a length of 205.7 ± 52.4 nm and a 20.5 aspect ratio. The crystal structure of cellulose Iβ was preserved by the CNCs, and the crystallinity was 72.36%. The temperature of the fibers’ thermal degradation lowered during the operations, although CNCs still had outstanding thermal stability (>200 °C). Aside from the CNCs, the aqueous suspension of CNCs was slightly agglomerated; thus, the zeta (ζ) potential of the CNCs’ suspension was −23.72 ± 1.7 mV, and the powder had high hydrophilicity. This research will be valuable to individuals who want to explore the possibility for CNCs made of jujube cores.",

METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 48 patients, aged 30-65 years, were randomly assigned to two intervention(n = 24) and control(n = 24) groups. The subjects in the intervention group received 30 g Ziziphus jujube daily for 12 weeks. At baseline and the end of the 12th week, 10 ml of blood was taken from each patient after a 12- to 14-h overnight fasting. Plasma levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglycerides(TGs), total cholesterol(TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol(HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol(LDL-C), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein(hs-CRP), and interleukin-6(IL-6) were measured. Anthropometric indices were determined. RESULTS: Plasma FPG, TG, TC, and LDL-C decreased significantly up to -11.36%, -13.59%, -7.46%, -7.65% in the Ziziphus jujube group at the end of week 12 compared to baseline, respectively (P < 0.05), and this reduction was significant in comparison with the control group (P < 0.05). The plasma hs-CRP reduced significantly up to -24.46% in the Ziziphus jujube group at the end of week 12 compared to baseline (P < 0.05), however, this reduction was not significant in comparison with the control group (P < 0.05). Also, there were no significant differences between the two groups in mean changes of body mass index, plasma HDL-C, and IL-6. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that daily consumption of Ziziphus jujube may have beneficial effects on the lipid profiles and blood glucose levels in T2D. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: T his clinical trial was registered at the Iranian registry of clinical trials (IRCT registration number: IRCT20181210041913N1).",

Joint effects were investigated from the viewpoint of the antioxidant (scavenging DPPH˙) and antitumor activities (against SW620 cells) of jujube polysaccharides and ginger 6-gingerol (G6G) alone and in combination. Jujube polysaccharides were extracted, purified, and characterized, and then their inhibiting and apoptotic effects alone and in combination with G6G were evaluated by the cytological tests, including Cell Counting Kit-8, colony-forming, Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and cell cycle assays. Results showed that the purified polysaccharide fraction (ZJPs-II) with average molecular weight of 115 kDa consisted of arabinose, rhamnose, glucose, xylose, and galactose. ZJPs-II and G6G alone dose-dependently scavenged DPPH˙ and inhibited the proliferation of SW620 cells, while their combination showed synergistic interactions (all combination index < 1). The studies further demonstrated that ZJPs-II and G6G alone reduced the cell colony-formation, induced apoptosis and arrested the cell-cycle at G2/M phase, while their combination achieved better effects and significantly arrested the growth at the G0/G1 phase. Collectively, our findings suggest enhancing the intake of jujube polysaccharides and G6G in a combinatorial approach for maintaining health and preventing cancer."

      "abstract": "Jujube has great potential as food and traditional drugs in several countries. To study the anti-inflammatory influence of jujube peel polyphenols in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced RAW 264.7 cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways. In this study, the phenolic composition of polyphenols in jujube peel was analyzed using LC-MS/MS, and which was confirmed that the main polyphenols were p-coumaric acid, catechin and rutin. Meanwhile, jujube peel polyphenols attenuated the generation of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, NO and PGE2 by inhibiting MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Additionally, jujube peel polyphenol activate Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, regulate antioxidant enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Results obtained from this study suggest that jujube peel polyphenols may alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation by inhibiting MAPK and NF-κB and activating Nrf2 signaling pathways. Furthermore, jujube peel polyphenols have a synergistic effect in the treatment of LPS-induced inflammatory in RAW 264.7 cells. In conclusion, this study not only reveals the mechanism by which jujube peel polyphenols inhibit LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells, but also provides guidance for the development of new anti-inflammatory drugs.",

The purpose of the present study was to formulate and investigate the efficacy and safety of jujube syrup on brightening of facial skin. In this randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical study, 46 participants consumed jujube syrup or placebo (23 in each group) twice a day for 8 weeks. The number of pigments, area of pigmentation, and physician's global assessment score (PGAS) were evaluated at baseline and after 8 weeks. The results showed the amounts of total phenolics and flavonoids were 81.97 ± 0.25 and 4.98 ± 1.04 mg/ml, respectively. The amounts of organic acids (gallic acid and chlorogenic acid) were quantified at 1140 ± 17.65 and 1520 ± 25.77 μg/ml, respectively. The amounts of total phenolic and flavonoids were stable under accelerated conditions. Eight weeks after treatment, the number of pigment counts reduced to 0.545 ± 0.307 compared to the placebo group. Moreover, the pigmented area and its percentages were significantly reduced to 0.556 ± 0.285 and 0.561 ± 0.288 in jujube syrup compared with placebo, respectively.

In the light of side effects of current antibiotics therapy and growing drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria, natural products have become attractive alternatives for antibiotics agents in dental practice.

Our results demonstrated that jujube polysaccharide prepared in this study was mainly composed by galacturonic acid with an average molecular weight 242 kDa, which were further characterized for structural features by FT-IR spectra and NMR spectroscopy analysis. This jujube polysaccharide was shown to exhibit remarkable inhibitory effects against all the tested oral bacterial pathogens through various mechanisms including growth inhibition, biofilm prevention and disruption, intervention of bacterial infection (adhesion and invasion), attenuation of cytotoxicity, modulation of excessive inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated and MRSA-infected macrophages as well as positive regulation of oral microbiota. The present study paves the way to explore jujube polysaccharides for the prevention and treatment of oral infectious diseases. Graphic Abstract.",

      "abstract": "Jujube witches' broom disease (JWB), one of the most serious phytoplasma diseases, usually results in the destruction of Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.). Although most jujube cultivars are sensitive to JWB, we found a few genotypes that are highly resistant to JWB. However, the molecular mechanism of phytoplasma resistance has seldom been studied. Here, we used Chinese jujube \"T13,\" which has strong resistance to JWB, and a typical susceptible cultivar, \"Pozao\" (\"PZ\"), as materials to perform comparative transcriptome, hormone, and regulation analyses. After phytoplasma infection, the differential expression genes (DEGs) were detected at all three growth phases (S1, S2, and S3) in \"PZ,\" but DEGs were detected only at the first growth phase in \"T13.\" Meanwhile, no phytoplasma was detected, and the symptoms especially witches' broom caused by JWB were not observed at the last two growth phases (S2 and S3) in \"T13.\" Protein-protein interaction analysis also showed that the key genes were mainly involved in hormone and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. In addition, during the recovered growth phase in \"T13\" from S1 to S2, the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was significantly increased and then decreased from S2 to S3. Moreover, jasmonic acid (JA) was significantly accumulated in \"PZ\" diseased plants, especially at the S2 phase and at the S2 phase in \"T13,\" while the content of salicylic acid (SA) decreased significantly at the S2 phase of \"T13\" compared to that in \"PZ.\" The changes in H2O2 and JA or SA were consistent with the changes in their key synthesis genes in the transcriptome data. Finally, exogenous application of an SA inhibitor [1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT)] rescued witches' broom symptoms, while the contents of both JA and MeJA increased after ABT treatment compared to the control, demonstrating that exogenous application of an SA inhibitor rescued the symptoms of jujube after phytoplasma infection by decreasing the contents of SA and increasing the contents of JA and MeJA. Collectively, our study provides a new perspective on the transcriptional changes of Chinese jujube in response to JWB and novel insights that the crosstalk of JA and SA signaling communicated together to contribute to \"T13\" JWB resistance."

We studied the regulation mechanism of propyl gallate (PG) on post-harvest physiological quality of winter jujube, from the perspective of antioxidant metabolism and peel structure. In our research, winter jujube fruits were treated with 0.001 mol L-1 PG solution for 20 min. Our results showed that PG delayed the development of peel color, and improved the firmness, total soluble solids (TSS), and titratable acid (TA) of winter jujube. Meanwhile, the PG treatment had higher content of total phenols, total flavonoids, ascorbic acid (AsA), and reduced glutathione (GSH), and kept the enzyme activity including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and peroxidase (POD) at a higher level. PG treatment reduced membrane oxidative damage and maintained the integrity of pericarp structure by reducing electrolyte leakage (EL), lipoxygenase activity (LOX), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the peel. Accordingly, PG improved the postharvest quality of jujube fruits by regulating antioxidant metabolism and maintaining the structure of peel. The appropriate concentration of PG has good application potential in the storage and preservation of fresh fruits such as winter jujube."

Moreover, few disinfection strategies are available for ready-to-eat fruits that do not need to be cut. In this study, the use of chlorine and ultrasound, two low-cost disinfection methods, were evaluated to disinfect winter jujube, a delicious, nutritious, and widely sold fruit in China. Ultrasound treatment (28 kHz) alone could not decrease the cross-contamination incidence of Escherichia coli O157:H7, non-O157 E. coli, and Salmonella Typhimurium, and free chlorine treatment at 10 ppm decreased the incidence from 55.00% to 5.00% for E. coli O157:H7, 65.00% to 6.67% for non-157 E. coli, and 70.00% to 6.67% for S. Typhimurium. The cross-contamination incidence was completely reduced (pathogens were not detected in sample) when the treatments were combined. The counts of aerobic mesophiles, aerobic psychrophiles, molds, yeasts, and three pathogens in the group subjected to combination treatment (28 kHz ultrasound + 10 ppm free chlorine) were significantly lower than those in the control, chlorine-treated, and ultrasound-treated groups during storage (0-7 d at 4 °C). Analysis of weight loss, sensory quality (crispness, color, and flavor), instrument color (a*/b*), soluble matter contents (total soluble solids, reducing sugar, total soluble sugar, and titratable acid), and nutritional properties (ascorbic acid and polyphenolic contents) indicated that treatment with ultrasound, chlorine, and their combination did not lead to additional quality loss compared with properties of the control. Additionally, the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenol oxidase were not significantly increased in the treatment group, consistent with the quality analysis results. These findings provide insights into disinfection of uncut ready-to-eat fruits using a minimum dose of disinfectant for cross-contamination prevention under ultrasonication. The use of ultrasound alone to decontaminate fresh produce is accompanied by a high risk of pathogen contamination, and the use of sanitizers to decrease cross-contamination incidence is recommended.",

      "abstract": "A combination process of completely non-thermal processing methods involving high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and vacuum-freeze drying (VFD) for producing a new snack from fruit and vegetable blends was developed, and the effect of the process on flavor quality was investigated. The HHP-VFD treatment did not significantly reduce volatile compound contents compared to single HHP or VFD. Gas chromatography-olfactometry showed that HHP-VFD raised the contents of floral-like volatile compounds (e.g., β-ionone) compared to the untreated sample. Sensory evaluation analysis confirmed that the overall liking was unchanged after the HHP-VFD treatment. The HHP-VFD combined treatment is effective in maintaining the flavor and extending shelf life, and is convenient for the portability and transportation of ready-to-drink juice."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antidiarrheal effect of jujube honey on experimentally castor oil-induced diarrhea in mice by using different testing models (diarrhea, enteropooling and gastrointestinal motility). METHODS: The mice intragastric administration castor oil was post-treated after 30 min with jujube honey, diluted jujube honey and loperamide or vehicles in different experimental groups. The onset and number of wet defecation on the absorbent paper was recorded for each animal for 4 h. Plasma was examined for C-reactive protein (CRP) and nitric oxide (NO) for clinical inflammation evaluation. The oxidative stress was investigated by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase levels. RESULTS: The diluted jujube honey exhibited an important antidiarrheal activity manifested by significant delay in onset of diarrhea (P < 0.05), loss in number of wet stools (P < 0.001), total number of stools (P < 0.001) and total stool weight of fecal output (P < 0.001) in 4 h in castor oil-induced diarrheal groups. The inhibition of intestinal transit of charcoal meal (P < 0.01) is a most likely mechanism that may account for antidiarrheal effect of jujube honey. It also significantly increased SOD and catalase levels (P < 0.001) and significantly decreased CRP and NO in plasma diarrheic mice (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results of this research reveal that the jujube honey contains pharmacologically active compounds with antidiarrheal properties. However, diluted honey is more effective in the treatment of diarrhea and imbalance of intestinal motility. In conclusion, these findings illustrated the antidiarrheal activity effect of jujube honey and which has the strongest evidence supporting its use in the treatment of diarrhea in traditional medicine.",

      "abstract": "In this research, a simple, green approach was employed to synthesize silver nanoparticles with the aid of Ziziphus spina-christi (L.) methanol root extract, which can act as a reducing, capping agent to treat obesity and inflammation. Globally, Ziziphus spina-christi (Jujube) root is used in traditional therapy as a lipolysis promoter. GC-MS results confirmed the availability of kaempferol (flavonol), cannabinol and indole-3-carboxylic acid in Ziziphus spina-christi root methanol extract (ZSE). ZSE silver nanoparticles (ZS-Ag-NPs) were synthesized and their effect on mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation capacity and adipokine levels in maturing adipocytes were analyzed. Maturing adipocytes treated with 0.4 µg/dL of ZSE and ZS-Ag-NPs significantly reduced the lipid content in adipocytes by 64% and 82%, respectively. In addition, lipolysis-related genes such as LPL (1.9 fold), HSL (2.3 fold), PGC-1α (3 fold), UCP-1 (4.1 fold), PRDM16 (2 fold) and PPARα (2.7 fold) increased significantly in ZS-Ag-NPs treated maturing adipocytes. The ZS-Ag-NPs treatment significantly decreased insulin resistance and metabolic inflammation-related LTB4-R, TNF-α, IL-4 and STAT-6 mRNA levels. Mitochondrial thermogenesis stimulating capacity of ZS-Ag-NPs was further confirmed by the significantly enhanced CREB-1 and AMPK protein levels in adipocytes. Furthermore, ZS-Ag-NPs treated adipokines (condition media, CM) were treated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to determine cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory stimulus capacity. We found that ZS-Ag-NPs treated adipocyte CM effectively increased mRNA expression levels of the vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), and down-regulated oxidative stress (LPO, eNOS, and HO) and vascular cell inflammation (ICAM, VCAM, TNF-α, IL-1β, and NF-κB). In conclusion, ZS-Ag-NPs displayed an action at the molecular level in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, decreased adipokine secretion in adipocytes, and enhanced vascular endothelial cell growth. This molecular mechanical action of ZS-Ag-NPs reduced effectively obesity progressions and metabolic inflammatory pathogenesis associated with aging."

      "abstract": "As the main economic crop cultivated in the Yellow River Delta, winter jujube contains various nutrients. However, soil salinization and fungal diseases have affected the yield and quality of winter jujube. In order to use plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) to reduce these damages, the antagonistic bacteria CZ-6 isolated from the rhizosphere of wheat in saline soil was selected for experiment. Gene sequencing analysis identified CZ-6 as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. In order to understand the salt tolerant and disease-resistant effects of CZ-6 strain, determination of related indicators of salt tolerance, pathogen antagonistic tests, and anti-fungal mechanism analyses was carried out. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of CZ-6 inoculation on the rhizosphere microbial community of winter jujube. The salt tolerance test showed that CZ-6 strain can survive in a medium with a NaCl concentration of 10% and produces indole acetic acid (IAA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase. Studies on the inhibition mechanism of pathogenic fungi show that CZ-6 can secrete cellulase, protease, and xylanase. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that CZ-6 can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including 2-heptanone and 2-nonanone. In addition, the strain can colonize the rhizosphere and migrate to the roots, stems, and leaves of winter jujube, which is essential for plant growth or defense against pathogens. Illumina MiSeq sequencing data indicated that, compared to the control, the abundance of salt-tolerant bacteria Tausonia in the CZ-6 strain treatment group was significantly increased, while the richness of Chaetomium and Gibberella pathogens was significantly reduced. Our research shows that CZ-6 has the potential as a biological control agent in saline soil. Plant damage and economic losses caused by pathogenic fungi and salt stress are expected to be alleviated by the addition of salt-tolerant antagonistic bacteria.",

      "abstract": "The effects of heat shock (HT), 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), or their combination (HT + 1-MCP) on the quality of fresh jujube fruits during cold storage were studied. Among them, HT showed the best preservation effect on jujube fruits, which was more effective than others in inhibiting the increase of red index, decay incidence, and weight loss and delaying the decrease of firmness, soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), and ascorbic acid (AsA) content. Besides, it could delay the degradation rate of the cell wall to maintain the integrity of cell membrane, and keep the high activity of active oxygen scavenging enzymes. During cold storage, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and relative electrolyte leakage (REL) of the HT group were significantly lower than those of the control group, 1-MCP, and HT + 1-MCP group (p < .05), while superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) activities were significantly higher than those of other groups (p < .05). It was concluded that the postharvest HT treatment could effectively delay the senescence and decay of jujube fruits. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Jujube fruits have high nutritional value used for food and medicine. However, they are not tolerant to storage after harvest, resulting in high economic losses. Therefore, it is of great significance to find a suitable method to maintain the quality of jujube fruits. Our results revealed the effect of HT, 1-MCP, and their combination on the quality maintenance of jujube fruits, and found that HT could effectively maintain the quality of them, which could be used as an effective method for keeping jujube fruits fresh.",

It was observed that the oral administration of jujube powder enriched CD8+ T cells in mouse MC38 colon tumor microenvironment and increased the diversity of gut microbiota and the abundance of Bifidobacteriales, which is helpful to the production of butyrate in the cecum content. The application of jujube powder also stimulated the production of white blood cells, especially CD8+ T cells in peripheral and bone marrow, while inhibiting the growth of eosinophils in peripheral blood and the production of IL-7 and GM-CSF in serum. All these are conductive to the significant inhibition of the tumor growth, suggesting the high potential of nurturing gut microbiota with natural products for improving the efficiency of chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Whereas dietary intervention with natural nutrients plays an important role in activating the immune response and holds unprecedented application potential, the underpinning mechanism is poorly understood. The present work was dedicated to comprehensively examine the effects of ultrafine jujube powder (JP) on the gut microbiota and, consequentially, the effects associated with the response rate to anti-PD-L1 treatment against murine colon adenocarcinoma. A murine colon adenocarcinoma model with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy was established to evaluate how dietary interventions affect the microbiota. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the role of SCFAs in the immune response. Oral administration of JP greatly improves the response of anti-PD-L1 treatment against murine colon adenocarcinoma. Such an improvement is associated with the alteration of gut microbiota which leads to an increased abundance of Clostridiales, including Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, an elevated SCFA production, and an intensified infiltration of CD8+ T cells to the tumor microenvironment. This work demonstrates that JP is particularly effective in modulating the gut microbiota for an improved immune checkpoint blockage therapy by boosting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The experimental findings of the present study are helpful for the development of dietary intervention methods for cancer immunotherapy using natural nutrients."

The impact of ultrasound power and temperature on the adsorption/desorption features of JPFs on MRs were studied. The maximum adsorption (80.21 ± 2.11 mg/g) /desorption (76.22 ± 1.68 mg/g) capacity of total flavonoids content were obtained. The pseudo-second-order kinetic and Freundlich isotherm models better described the whole process of ultrasound-assisted adsorption. The adsorption process was spontaneous, physical, and dominated by multilinear intraparticle diffusion. Ultrasound mainly enhanced the adsorption capacity by strengthening the formation of hydrogen bonds and increasing the surface roughness of MRs. Besides, the principal individual flavonoid ((+)-Catechin, (-)-Epicatechin, Rutin, Quercetin-3-O-robinobioside) content of JPFs in ultrasound treatment was 2-3 times that of shaking treatment, and biological activities were significantly increased. Overall, as a low-cost green technology, ultrasound can improve the properties of MRs and better purify JPFs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Jujube contains a waxy cuticle that acts as a barrier against fungal pathogens, prevents nutrition damage and leakage due to mechanical damage, and maintains water content. Chemical treatment before drying is the most commonly used method for whole jujube. Although chemical pretreatment can effectively enhance drying kinetics, it can lead to the loss of soluble nutrients and cause food safety issues due to chemical residues. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effect of various pretreatments (cold plasma, cold plasma activated water, ultrasonics, thermosonication, and blanching) on the drying process and quality properties of whole jujube so as to find effective green alternatives to chemical pretreatment. RESULTS: The application of chemical, cold plasma, and thermosonication significantly altered the surface morphology of jujube by etching larger cracks and holes, which can facilitate the transfer of moisture, thereby improving the drying rate and the effective diffusivity. Chemical, cold plasma, and thermosonication pretreatment reduced drying time by 18%, 12%, and 7% respectively, thereby increasing the content of total phenolics by 13%, 12%, and 6% respectively, and enhancing antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing antioxidant power) by 13%, 11%, and 3% respectively. In addition, chemical and cold plasma pretreatment reduced the generation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural by 25% and 15% respectively. CONCLUSION: Cold plasma is a promising green alternative method to chemical pretreatment for drying processes of whole jujube. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",
