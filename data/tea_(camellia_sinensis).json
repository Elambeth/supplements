      "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anthracycline antibiotic widely used as an antineoplastic agent. L-theanine (LTN) is a unique amino acid obtained from tea (Camellia sinensis) and a highly valuable nutraceutical additive in the food industry. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LTN on ovarian endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in DOX-induced rats. The rats were divided into one of four groups: Control (saline), DOX (20 mg/kg DOX, i.p.), DOX + LTN200 (DOX + 200 mg/kg LTN) and DOX + LTN400 (DOX + 400 mg/kg LTN). DOX was administered on the first day, followed by three consecutive days of LTN via oral gavage. The levels of ERS (GRP78, IRE1, and CHOP), oxidative stress (TOS, OSI, and MDA), inflammation (TNF-α) and fertility (E2 and PGN) parameters were analyzed using ELISA or assay kits. In addition, morphological and apoptotic (DNA fragmentation) changes in ovarian tissues were examined histologically. The study found that both doses of LTN were effective in reversing DOX-induced ERS by lowering oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, and alleviating morphological changes. However, the 400 mg/kg LTN group exhibited more significant effects. LTN treatment thus has the potential to alleviate the adverse effects on ovarian tissue caused by DOX by modulating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and associated conditions."

      "abstract": "Aging is characterized by progressive multisystem deterioration driven by molecular and cellular mechanisms encapsulated in the twelve hallmarks of aging. Green tea (GT), derived from Camellia sinensis, has garnered significant scientific interest due to its rich polyphenolic composition, particularly epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and its pleiotropic health benefits. In this narrative review, we explored the multifaceted mechanisms through which GT may mitigate the aging hallmarks. Evidence from in vitro, animal, and human studies has shown that GT polyphenols can enhance DNA repair pathways, preserve telomere length, modulate epigenetic aging markers, improve proteostasis and autophagic flux, regulate nutrient-sensing networks, and rejuvenate mitochondrial function. Additionally, GT exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and may restore a physiological gut microbiota composition. Beyond molecular and cellular effects, GT consumption in humans has been associated with improved cognitive function, cardiovascular health, muscle preservation, and metabolic regulation in aging populations. Collectively, these findings highlight GT's potential as a naturally occurring geroscience intervention capable of addressing the interconnected network of aging processes more comprehensively than single-target pharmaceuticals. Future research should focus on optimizing dosing regimens, exploring synergies with other anti-aging strategies, and investigating personalized responses to GT interventions."

      "abstract": "Green tea (Camellia sinensis L.), one of the most popular beverages worldwide, contains caffeine, a natural stimulant. However, some green tea extracts have been known to possess both hypnotic and arousal effects. This study aimed to identify the components influencing these dual effects using a green tea ethanol extract (GE). Response surface methodology revealed that only some extraction conditions significantly induced arousal effects in ICR mice during the pentobarbital-induced sleep test. Among these, extraction with 95% ethanol for 195 minutes achieved the maximum arousal effect, corresponding to a caffeine content of 58.9 mg g-1, comparable to the effects observed with the reference, 25 mg kg-1 of caffeine. In addition, administration of this GE sample significantly increased wakefulness for 3 hours following treatment in C57BL/6N mice, as confirmed through sleep architecture analysis. A correlation analysis of the total phenolic content (TPC) to caffeine ratio in GE found that the intensity of the arousal-inducing effects varied with TPC (R2 = 0.9428). It was also confirmed that the ratio of EGCG to caffeine, major components of GE, was more closely associated with sleep duration (R2 = 0.9034). L-Theanine, known for its sleep-promoting effects, did not independently affect the arousal effects of GE. However, when combined with EGCG, their total content showed a slightly stronger correlation with sleep duration in relation to the caffeine ratio, compared with that of EGCG/caffeine ratio (R2 = 0.9464). Therefore, the balance between TPC and caffeine appears to modulate the stimulant properties of GE, highlighting its potential as both a stimulant and a mild hypnotic agent. Collectively, these findings provide insights into optimizing GE for tailored functional foods based on its polyphenol/caffeine ratio."

      "abstract": "Tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) are commercial perennial woody crops, which has been widely cultivated in more than 60 countries all over the world (Hajiboland 2017). Tea gray blight is a foliar disease that reduces quality and yield by 20-30% (Horikawa 1986). During March of 2022, a disease survey was conducted on a 300 ha tea plantation (Liyang Tianmu Lake tea research Institute) in the Liyang area of Jiangsu province (31°19'37.64''N, 119°23'46.37''E). The disease damaged 30% of the tea plants, and 'Baiye No. 1' was the most impacted with an average disease incidence rate of 50-60%. In early stages of infection, leaves exhibited small yellow-green lesions at the tips and margins. These lesions gradually expanded into round or irregular brown spots characterized by distinct concentric rings and black conidial disks arranged in whorls. These symptoms are consistent with tea gray blight disease associated with Neopestalotiopsis piceana reported by the previous study (Wang et al. 2022). A total of 15 lesions were collected from different plants and sent to the Plant Protection Laboratory of Nanjing Agricultural University for analysis. To identify the pathogens, leaves with necrotic lesions were cut into 5 × 5 mm pieces at the junction between diseased and healthy tissues, surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 1 min, disinfected with 2% sodium hypochlorite for 3 min, and then rinsed three times with sterile water. The tissues were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates containing 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate (Wang et al. 2022) and incubated at 25°C in the dark. A total of 15 isolates were obtained from 15 different lesions with typical symptoms as described earlier and identified as Pestalotiopsis-like fungus by spore morphological identification (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2014), the conidia length and width of which were shorter than that of Pseudopestalotiopsis theae. Pure cultures were obtained by monosporic isolation, and the representative isolates J15 and F22 randomly selected were used for morphological studies and phylogenetic analyses. The cultures of the two isolates grown on PDA were white, cottony, and flocculent and contained undulate edges with dense aerial mycelium on the surface, black, wet conidial masses emerged after 7 days. Conidia were five celled, clavate to fusiform, smooth, and 17.9 to 25.3 × 5.3 to 9.1 μm (n = 50). The three median cells were dark brown to olivaceous, the central cell was darker than the other two cells, and the basal and apical cells were hyaline. Conidia developed filiform appendages: one basal appendage (3.5 to 9.3 μm long; n = 50) and two to three apical appendages (15 to 35 μm long; n = 50). Morphological features were similar to Neopestalotiopsis chrysea (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2012). To further identify, the partial internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and ß-tubulin 2 (TUB2) regions and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-a) genes of the two isolates were amplified from genomic DNA using the primers ITS1/TS4, Bt2a /Bt2b, and EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Glass and Donaldson 1995; Carbone and Kohn 1999), respectively. The ITS, TUB2, and TEF1-a sequences of J15 and F22 were submitted to GenBank and the accession numbers were PQ489357, PQ489381, PQ505998, PQ505999, PQ539625 and PQ539626. The sequences were compared using the MEGA (ver. 11), and sequences with the same ID were concatenated using the PhyloSuite (ver.1.2.3) software package, and then, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the concatenated sequences (ITS, TUB2, and TEF1-a). The phylogenetic analyses on the basis of multilocus gene sequences revealed that two isolates J15 and F22 were located in one clade with the known N. chrysea isolates (FZXM038, host: blueberry, China) in references (Fig 2). The other hosts of N. chrysea reported in China were Ligustrum lucidum, Liquidambar formosana or Carya illinoinensis. According to the morphology and molecular characterization, J15 and F22 were identified as N. chrysea. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on 18 healthy tea plants (1-year-old rooted cuttings of 'Baiye No. 1' purchased from Nanjing Yarun tea Co., LTD) which were cultivated in a Light incubator at 23°C, 16h light /8h dark, light intensity 200 μmol m-2s-1, 65% RH. Leaves were scratched slightly with a sterile needle, and pathogen plugs (5 mm diameter) were placed on the wounds with the mycelial side facing down and covered with sterile absorbent cotton to maintain moisture. Control leaves were wounded and covered with sterile PDA plugs (three replicates per treatment, three plants per replicate). The inoculated leaves showed symptoms similar to those observed in the field, whereas the control leaves were asymptomatic after 14 days inoculation. The fungi N. chrysea were consistently reisolated only from the inoculated and symptomatic leaves by morphological and molecular identification, fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of N. chrysea infecting tea plants associated with gray blight in China. The sequences from this work have been submitted to GenBank, and this work provides crucial information for the prevention and management of gray blight on tea plants."

In this study, the synergistic effects of the Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation treatment and the tea polyphenols (TP) addition on the flavor variations, protein structure, microstructure, and dispersion properties of EWP were investigated. The flavor results suggested that fermentation and TP reduced undesirable flavor substances (e.g. nonanal, decanal, and 3-methylbutanal), while the interaction between some volatile organic compounds produced by fermentation and protein flavor-binding sites was enhanced. Fermentation unfolded protein structures, increasing binding sites for TP and improving flavor-binding efficiency. Additionally, strong electrostatic repulsion introduced by fermentation improved the dispersion and stability of the EWP system. This approach provides a promising strategy for deodorizing and solubilizing EWP, advancing its potential in food processing.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In winter, tea plants are highly susceptible to low-temperature freezing damage. The rapid recovery of tea plant vigor in spring is crucial for tea yield and quality. Some studies have reported that Bacillus mucilaginosus could improve the stress resistance of plants. However, there were no reports on the effect of B. mucilaginosus on the recovery of tea plant vigor after low-temperature stress. This study firstly used different concentrations of B. mucilaginosus to spray tea leaves and used 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology to study the impact of different treatments on tea leaf endophytic populations. Meanwhile, physiological indexes such as Soil and plant analyzer development values (SPAD), maximum photochemical quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured and analyzed in tea plant leaves of different treatments, and the correlation between them and the bacterial community was studied. RESULTS: Microbial results showed that the diversity of leaf endophytic populations treated with different concentrations of Bacillus mucilaginosus (T1, T2, T3) was higher than that in control group (CK) leaves, and T2 treatment had the highest diversity. The dominant bacterial phyla of all samples were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota in leaves treated with B. mucilaginosus was significantly higher than that in the control. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Paenibacillus, Nocardioides, and Marmoricola in leaves treated with B. mucilaginosus was significantly higher than that in the control. Different concentrations of B. mucilaginosus affected the distribution of leaf endophytic populations. At the level of bacterial function, abundant metabolic functional features were observed, including amino acid transport and metabolism, as well as energy production and conversion, indicating that bacterial metabolism in tea plant leaf samples tends to be vigorous. The treatment with B. mucilaginosus significantly increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes and osmolyte content, promoted the recovery of Fv/Fm in tea plants after low-temperature stress, and improved the resistance of tea leaves to low-temperature stress, thereby promoting recovery. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that B. mucilaginosus could significantly change the community structure of leaf endophytic populations, and increase antioxidant enzyme activity and osmolyte content in tea plants after low-temperature stress, promoting the rapid recovery of photosynthesis, and thereby benefiting the recovery of tea plant leaves. This study provided a theoretical basis for the application of B. mucilaginosus in practical production and also provided new ideas for the recovery of tea plants exposed to low-temperature stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Improper herbicide application can affect tea plant physiology and elevate risks to tea consumption. This study investigated the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of glyphosate (GLY), bentazone (BNTZ), and atrazine (ATZ) in hydroponic tea seedlings under single and mixed treatments at concentrations of 20, 50, and 100 mg L-1 over 5 and 13 days. RESULTS: Chlorophyll content decreased by 29.4-39.5% after mixed treatment at 100 mg L-1 for 13 days, whereas malondialdehyde content increased by 0.99-1.37-fold compared with single treatment. The distribution of ATZ and BNTZ after single treatment was roots > stems > mature leaves > young leaves, whereas GLY distribution was roots > stems > young leaves > mature leaves under both treatments. Deethyl atrazine (an ATZ metabolite) residues were 4.58- and 1.44-fold higher than deisopropylatrazine (another metabolite of ATZ) after single and mixed treatments respectively. The total 8-OH bentazone (a BNTZ metabolite) content was 6.23 times greater under mixed treatment than single treatment. In addition, GLY and its metabolite aminomethyl phosphonic acid residues were 0.24-17.9-fold and 0.05-478-fold higher after mixed treatment compared with single treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Herbicide mixtures typically led to greater accumulation of both precursors and metabolites compared with single herbicide applications, and longer exposure times resulted in higher residue levels and more severe phytotoxic effects. These findings provide a reference for safer herbicide use in tea plantations, ensuring the quality and safety of tea products. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "Tea plants, in particular, leafy cash crops, prefer warm and humid climates. Our previous work identified CsPAT1 as a facilitator of lignin biosynthesis in tea plants. The specific role of CsPAT1 in tea plants' abiotic stress response remains unclear. In this study, we found that the expression of CsPAT1 in tea plants was induced under drought, cold, heat, and ABA treatments. CsPAT1 transgenic Arabidopsis lines displayed enhanced drought tolerance compared with wild-type (WT) controls. The SOD and POD activities, proline content, and expression levels of drought-responsive genes were significantly increased in transgenic Arabidopsis under drought stress treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Correspondingly, total flavonoid contents were significantly higher in the CsPAT1 transgenic lines. Through UPLC-MS/MS-based flavonoid metabolome analysis, we identified and quantified 24 flavonoid metabolites. Notably, CsPAT1 transgenic lines exhibited significantly lower levels of phenylpropanoids and hydroxycinnamic acids, key precursors in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Conversely, nine flavonoid compounds were significantly elevated in the transgenic lines, including apigenin, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, kaempferide, naringenin, butin, catechin, biochanin A, daidzin, and genistein. These findings suggest that CsPAT1 may enhance drought resistance by regulating the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway. Our results provide insights for future breeding strategies to enhance drought tolerance in tea plants."

This review explores its role in managing periodontal disease, a common condition characterized by inflammation, microbial imbalances, and tissue destruction. The primary bioactive components, particularly epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), contribute to green tea's therapeutic effects by inhibiting bacterial adhesion, modulating inflammatory pathways, and reducing oxidative stress. Clinical studies suggest green tea improves periodontal health by reducing pocket depth, inflammation, and bleeding. It can serve as an adjunct to conventional therapies, including scaling and root planing, and be incorporated into oral care products such as mouthwashes and dentifrices. Furthermore, green tea presents a natural alternative to chemical agents like chlorhexidine, potentially mitigating side effects and addressing concerns about antibiotic resistance. However, its efficacy remains moderate compared to established treatments, highlighting the need for further research to optimize its formulation and therapeutic applications. Green tea represents a sustainable and biocompatible approach to periodontal therapy, supporting its integration into preventive and therapeutic oral health strategies."

In a 21-day experiment, 480 one-day-old male broiler (Ross 708) chicks were equally allotted into four dietary treatment groups. From days 1 to 10, all groups received a corn-soy basal diet, switching to a wheat-fish diet on day 11. Treatments included CON (no GTE), GTX, GTY, and GTZ (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg GTE, respectively). On day 11, each group split into ACON, AGTX, AGTY, and AGTZ, totaling eight treatments. From days 17 to 20, ACON, AGTX, AGTY, and AGTZ chicks were orally challenged twice daily with 3 mL CP26 (2.5 × 108 CFU/mL). On d 16 (pre-challenge) and d 1 post-challenge, ileo-jejunal contents were collected for CP enumeration, and jejunum tissue was analyzed via qRT-PCR to determine the expression levels of IL-1β, IFNγ, TNF-α, TGFβ, IL-10, and MUC2 genes. Challenged chicks showed poorer (p ≤ 0.05) growth and higher intestinal CP, with a potential improvement in GTE-supplemented diets. Findings suggests that dietary GTE supplementation mitigated the characteristic growth depression during SNE, reduced intestinal CP infection, and modulated inflammatory response in broiler chicks.",

      "abstract": "Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a widely used method for plant genetic modification. However, its efficiency in tea plants is notably low, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, hindering advancements in the molecular breeding and biology of tea plants. In this study, tobacco was utilized as a model to investigate the effects of various concentrations of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on Agrobacterium transformation efficiency. The results demonstrated that at an EGCG concentration of 0.4 mg/mL, Agrobacterium nearly lost its ability to transform tobacco. Additionally, malondialdehyde content in Agrobacterium was measured before and after EGCG treatment. The findings indicated that EGCG treatment led to an increase in malondialdehyde content. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in Agrobacterium flagellar synthesis and secretion systems were down-regulated under EGCG stress. Furthermore, flgE, virB4, and virB6 were identified as hub genes through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). These results elucidate the dynamic mechanisms by which EGCG affects Agrobacterium at both the physicochemical and molecular levels, providing a theoretical basis for optimizing genetic transformation in tea plants."

      "abstract": "Literature suggests that tea (Camellia sinensis) is a potent therapeutic agent and acts against many skin diseases. L-theanine, also known as γ-glutamyl ethylamide, is a non-protein amino acid, naturally obtained from tea and has structural similarity with the neurotransmitter glutamate. This study was conducted to evaluate the role of L-theanine, in the prevention of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) mediated atopic dermatitis (AD) in BALB/c mice. To achieve our goal, serological, histological, immunohistochemical and behavioural analyses, biochemical assays, immunophenotyping, skin scoring, etc. were carried out. L-theanine and DNCB docking with filaggrin protein was also checked as a part of in-silico analysis. No significant changes in serological profile were found, however, a substantial rise in leukocytes and macrophages were observed in the DNCB administered animals. L-theanine treatment altered such effects. ProTox profiling of L-theanine didn't show cytotoxicity. No significant changes were observed in any other profiling assays except in the skin histology. Further, L-theanine was found to bind more effectively at the active site of filaggrin (key protein affected in AD) than DNCB. Therefore, L-theanine represents itself as a potent ameliorative agent against DNCB induced atopic dermatitis."

      "abstract": "Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) is an important ingredient that indicates tea quality and has healthcare functions. Magnesium nutrition can improve the quality and yield of tea plants, but its regulatory role in the biosynthesis of EGCG in tea plants has not been clarified. Herein, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the metabolomics and transcriptomics of the shoots of 'Huangdan' at five magnesium concentrations: L1-L5 (0, 0.15, 0.45, 0.6, and 0.9 mmol/L mg2+, respectively). The results showed that the EGCG content of tea shoots treated with low magnesium concentrations was higher compared to those treated with high magnesium concentrations. The contents of related metabolites such as p-coumaric acid and cyanide in the EGCG synthesis pathway increased in the L4 and L5 treatment groups, while those of dihydroquercetin, dinnamic acid, and epicatechin increased significantly in the L2 and L3 treatment groups. Under the influence of magnesium treatment, the biosynthesis of EGCG was affected by a series of structural genes: CsPAL (HD.01G0005520), HD.02G0024350), Cs4CL (HD.15G0008250, HD.13G0010220), CsDFR (HD.04G0026220), CsANS(HD.12G0016700) with CsaroDE (HD.03G0002480)-positive regulation, and CsPAL (HD.13G0009900, HD.06G0008610), CsC4H (HD.06G0017130), Cs4CL (HD.02G0027390, HD.04G0003270), CsCHS (HD.10G0022640), CsCHI (HD.01G0011100), CsF3'H (HD.15G0015490), CsF3'5'H (HD.13G0004300), CsANS (HD.07G0023630), and Csaro B (HD.01G0028400) with CsSCPL (HD.01G0041070)-negative regulation. Transcription factors MYB 44 and WRKY 17 may play a key role in EGCG biosynthesis, which is significantly induced by magnesium nutrition in tea tree shoots. This study elucidates the effect of magnesium nutrition on EGCG biosynthesis in tea plants and provides key candidate transcription factors to provide a reference for further research on high-EGCG tea varieties to improve tea quality."

      "abstract": "Benzoates, particularly salicylic acid (SA) and its derivatives, play critical roles in plant immune responses and basal defense through hydroxylation and glycosylation. Anthracnose is one of the most common and devastating diseases in tea plants (Camellia sinensis). However, the role of SA and its derivatives in tea plant immunity and resistance to anthracnose remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we identified and characterized a glycosyltransferase, CsUGT74B5, which was significantly downregulated in tea seedlings upon anthracnose infection. CsUGT74B5 was preferentially expressed in mature leaves and stem, and responded rapidly to exogenous SA treatment. Phylogenetic analysis suggested CsUGT74B5 might possess the catalytic activity toward benzoates. Enzymatic assays and molecular docking demonstrated recombinant CsUGT74B5 specifically glycosylated at the ortho hydroxyl groups of SA and 2, 6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2, 6-DHBA), but did not glycosylate 2, 3-DHBA, 2, 5-DHBA, or other substrates in vitro. Overexpression of CsUGT74B5 in Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) reduced SA level while promoting the accumulation of SA 2-O-β-D-glucoside (SAG), further validating the in vivo function of CsUGT74B5. Moreover, transient overexpression of CsUGT74B5 in two tea plant cultivars increased their sensitivity to anthracnose and accelerated lesion development, which was attributed to decreased SA levels. Overall, our finding demonstrated that CsUGT74B5-mediated biosynthesis of SAG regulated tea plant immunity against anthracnose by fine-tuning free SA levels, providing new progress into the immunity response of tea plants."

Characterization experiments demonstrated that ultrasonic synergistic cold isostatic pressure extraction could effectively destroy the plant structure and promote the efflux of active ingredients. Then, the flavonoid extracts were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by LC-MS/MS, and three flavonoids were identified and found to be higher in the ultrasonic-cold isostatic pressure synergistic extraction group.

      "abstract": "The influenza virus, especially influenza A (IAV), has remained a constant global health threat due to its high morbidity rate and ability to undergo antigenic shifts and drifts, causing pandemics and epidemics. Due to the rapid evolution of IAV, novel therapeutics are urgently required to combat these viruses effectively, as they develop resistance against current therapeutics. Natural products have been the subject of debate for alternative IAV therapy, where the abundance of bioactive compounds offers numerous potentials for novel anti-IAV drug discovery. Therefore, this review discusses the antiviral effects of natural plant extracts against IAV. Examples are Silybum marianum, Scutellaria baicalensis, Angelica dahurica, Peganum harmala, Sambucus nigra, Echinacea purpurea, Panax ginseng, and Camellia sinensis. Most studies found that Si. marianum inhibits viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis. In contrast, Sc. baicalensis, A. dahurica, Sa. nigra, C. sinensis, and E. purpurea were effective in preventing the entry or binding of IAV into host cells. On the other hand, Sc. baicalensis and Pa. ginseng exert their anti-IAV effect via immunomodulation. Peganum harmala, on the contrary, exhibits a direct virucidal effect against IAV. These studies have shown promising results from using natural products against IAV, which may aid in formulating combinatorial compounds as anti-IAV therapy.",

      "abstract": "Nitrate (NO3 -), a key form of inorganic nitrogen (N) in soils, is typically lost in tea gardens through leaching. However, NO3 - utilization efficiency (NiUE) and its characteristic mechanism in tea plants remain unclear. This study screened contrastive genotypes of NiUE using leaf chlorate sensitivity and explored the potential genes that regulate this process. Fresh branches of 10 cultivars were hydroponically cultivated and subjected to potassium nitrate (KNO3) and potassium chlorate (KClO3) treatments, with the former as the control group. The sensitive cultivar, Zhenong 117 (ZN117), showed a decrease in SPAD and Fv/Fm values following KClO3 treatment, while the tolerant cultivar, Teiguanyin (TGY), exhibited minimal significant changes. After 5 days of cultivation, the 15N concentration and proportion in new shoots of ZN117 were significantly higher than those in TGY. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of genes responsible for NO3 - transport, including the nitrate transporters NRT2.4, NPF4.6, NPF6.1, NPF1.10, and NPF1.11, significantly increased in ZN117 after NO3 - supply. Genes involved in NO3 - reduction, chlorophyll synthesis, and photosynthesis were progressively induced. Coexpression network analysis indicated that the squamosa promoter-binding protein activated the onset of NO3 - signaling, while basic helix-loop-helix transcripts were triggered to higher levels during NO3 - supply. This study proposes a rapid characterization method of NiUE in woody plants and a speculative molecular regulatory mechanism for the NO3 - transfer and remobilization of tea plants. A set of specific genes involved in NO3 - transport, reduction, and mobilization were identified and proposed as marker genes for NiUE in tea plants."

Furthermore, TB demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects in the liver, adipose tissue, and intestines, as well as enhancing intestinal integrity. Additionally, TB was found to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis and promote fatty acid oxidation. Notably, TB altered gut metabolites, particularly l-palmitoylcarnitine, which showed an elevation in serum, liver, and adipose tissue following TB intervention. l-Palmitoylcarnitine reduced gluconeogenesis in primary hepatocytes and decreased lipid deposition in both primary hepatocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro. However, these effects were abolished when the circadian gene Period 3 (Per3) was knocked down. Our findings suggest that l-palmitoylcarnitine may play a crucial role in improving TB-mediated glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism by regulating Per3.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Azadirachta indica is also referred to as margosa or neem. It is found throughout the Indian subcontinent. Aegle marmelos L. (family: Rutaceae), sometimes referred to as Bael in Hindi, is a crucial food plant in India. The fruit has traditionally been used for the treatment of inflammation, diabetes, respiratory disorders, diarrhea, and dysentery. Aegle marmelos fruits are abundant in coumarins, carotenoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids. The plant referred to as Camellia sinensis, or tea, is part of the Theaceae family and is often grown in tropical and subtropical regions. OBJECTIVE: Acne is a prolonged inflammatory condition of the skin that has a significant negative influence on patients' quality of life all over the world. Although it is most commonly seen in young people, it may impact people of any age. Herbal anti-acne facewash gels were prepared using Carbopol 934 and extracts from Azadirachta indica, Aegle marmelos L., and Camellia sinensis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-acne facewash gel formulations were prepared in five different concentrations of 1%, 0.90%, 0.80%, 0.60%, and 0.50%, labeled as F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5, respectively. RESULTS: The anti-acne properties of the formulations were evaluated. The outcomes demonstrated gels to have an excellent spreading coefficient, a great physical appearance, and be non-irritating. Standard commercial formulations were used to investigate the effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Unlike marketed formulations, the developed formulation 3 (F3) demonstrated an excellent spreading coefficient and good % extrudability. It has been shown to be a more potent and effective polyherbal anti-acne facewash gel for treating acne. In recent years, there has been a rise in the patenting of herbal formulations, and several in vitro and in vivo studies have produced scientific proof of their medicinal efficacy. This work discusses many patented herbal compositions and how they might be used therapeutically to treat different diseases."

      "abstract": "Duyun Maojian Tea mainly cultivated in Duyun City is one of the ten famous teas in China. A brown leaf spot was discovered in March 2023 in Qiannan Normal University for Nationalities' Maojian Tea experimental field (26.29°N, 107.52°E). The incidence of the disease is about 40% surveyed on about 300 m2 of tea plants. Infected leaves showed light brown, round or irregular lesions. With disease progression, they enlarged and merged, creating dark brown necrotic zones along leaf edges. To identify the responsible pathogen, three symptomatic leaves from the tea nursery base were collected. The samples were cut 3 mm x 3 mm tissues with 75% ethanol for 30 s and 5% sodium hypochlorite for 60 s, rinsing three times with sterile water. Tissues were taken to potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and incubated dark at 28 °C for 3 days. Three isolates (TF1, TF3 and TF5) with similar morphology were obtained from three samples, respectively. The colony showed white, with short, villous hyphae expanding radially. Notably, mycelium near the disc was erect and sparse 2 cm away. After 30 days, conidia were observed. Alpha conidia (5.9 to 8.6 μm × 2.0 to 2.8 μm (n = 50)) were colorless and transparent, no septum, ellipsoid to spindle-shaped. Beta conidia (11.1 to 25.3 μm × 1.0 to 1.8 μm (n = 50)) were transparent, no septum, filiform, hooklike, tapering towards the ends. The isolates were identified as Diaporthe pescicola based on the morphology (Zhang et al. 2022). Genomic DNA was extracted, the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), β-tubulin (tub2), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF) genes were amplified with primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), Bt2a/Bt2b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), and EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), respectively, and sequenced. The ITS (PQ163865, PQ685064 and PQ685065), tub2 (PQ197032, PV055438 and PV055439), and TEF (PQ197029, PV055440 and PV055441) sequences of isolates (TF1, TF3 and TF5) were deposited in GenBank, respectively. BLAST searches showed >97% nucleotide identity to sequences of D. pescicola MFLUCC 16-0105 (ITS, 98.40% to KU557555.1; tub2, 97.40% to KU557579.1; and TEF, 97.63% to KU557623.1). The phylogenetic tree of ITS, tub2, and TEF gene sequences was constructed using MEGA 6 software with the neighbour-joining method (NJ), and the bootstrap method was employed for 1,000 repeated tests. Isolates TF1, TF3, TF5, and D. pescicola DT 1-1 were grouped together in a node with a bootstrap value of 99. Isolates were identified as D. pescicola. Since large quantities of conidia are difficult to produce in cultures, pathogenicity on the wounded leaves of 5-year-old tea plants of Duyun Maojian Tea local population was conducted by inoculating 6 mm mycelium discs of TF1. The control group and the treatment group were inoculated with 3 tea plants, repeated 2 times. All tea plants were incubated at 25 ± 1 °C, 70% humidity, and natural daylight. The onset of symptoms appeared 7 days later. Lesions were brown, similar to field symptoms. In contrast, the control were healthy. A strain exhibiting the same morphology as TF1 was re-isolated from the diseased portion. ITS, tub2, and TEF gene sequences were consistent with TF1, completing Koch's postulates. D. pescicola as a pathogen has caused leaf spot on Kerria japonica (Zhang et al. 2022), dieback on Prunus persica (Dissanayake et al. 2017) and Vitis vinifera (Manawasinghe et al. 2019), and shoot canker on Pyrus plants (Guo et al. 2020). To our knowledge, this is the first report of tea leaf spot caused by D. pescicola in China and worldwide. It is imperative to develop and implement control measures to manage the disease."

      "abstract": "Soil acidification in tea (Camellia sinensis L.) gardens leads to nutrient depletion, inhibits the growth of tea plants, reduces tea quality, and activates heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) in the soil. To clarify the impact of soil pH under acidified conditions on tea plant growth physiology and the key genes involved in Cd2+ transport in tea plants, this study planted 'Longjing 43' under different pH levels (4.0, 4.5, and 5.5) and Cd concentrations (T1 = 0 mg L-1, T2 = 0.01 mg L-1, T3 = 0.05 mg L-1, and T4 = 0.2 mg L-1). The results showed that the concentration of Cd in tea plants from highest to lowest was root > stem > mature leaves > young leaves. Under T4, with decreasing pH, the total chlorophyll significantly decreased, the Fv/Fm significantly decreased, stomatal aperture reduced, and net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate significantly decreased. In the T4 treatment at pH = 4.0, the contents of free proline and malondialdehyde were both the highest, while superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase from micrococcus lysodeiktic (CAT) showed a significant negative correlation with pH. By screening the tea genome data, a total of nine CsHMAs involved in metal ion transport were identified. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression level of CsHMA2 was the highest in young leaves of tea, and CsHMA2 was localized on the cell membrane. Under T4 and pH = 4.0, transient overexpression of CsHMA2 enhanced the ability of tea to transport Cd2+, whereas transient silencing of CsHMA2 weakened this ability. These findings not only help understand how tea adapts and regulates its physiological processes in acidic environments but also provide an important theoretical basis and technical guidance for soil improvement in tea gardens, the control of heavy metal pollution, and the optimization of tea quality."

      "abstract": "The global rise in antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to public health, necessitating alternative therapeutic options. One critical challenge is treating infections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria, which are notably resistant to conventional antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA), is a major pathogen in biofilm-related infections, complicating treatment and leading to chronic cases. Plant extracts have emerged as promising alternatives, offering new avenues for effective treatment. This study evaluated the antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of commercial extracts of Vitis vinifera L. (grape), Camellia sinensis L. (green tea), Olea europaea L. (olive), Quercus robur (oak), and Coffea arabica L. (coffee) against S. aureus strains from ATCC collections and clinical isolates. Preliminary screening using the disk diffusion test assessed the zones of inhibition, which was followed by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination via broth microdilution, with Quercus robur L. showing the best overall MIC results. The results obtained demonstrate the strong antibacterial activity of the extracts, with the MIC values ranging from 0.2 to 12.4 mg/mL. Using the XTT reduction assay, the extracts inhibited biofilm growth by 80-85% after 24 h of incubation, with Coffea arabica L. achieving interesting antibiofilm activities. These findings suggest that the investigated plant extracts hold potential as antimicrobial agents and biofilm inhibitors, offering an alternative approach to tackling antimicrobial resistance. Further research is needed to explore their potential applications in developing novel adjuvant therapies."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and dyslipidaemia is one of the major risk factors. The widespread use of herbs and medicinal plants in traditional medicine has garnered increasing recognition as a valuable resource for increasing wellness and reducing the onset of disease. Several epidemiologic and clinical studies have shown that altering blood lipid profiles and maintaining gut homeostasis may protect against cardiovascular diseases. Methods: A randomised, active-controlled parallel human clinical trial (n = 52) with three herbal tea infusions (green (Camellia sinensis) tea with rhubarb root, green tea with senna, and active control green tea) daily for 21 days in a free-living healthy adult cohort was conducted to assess the potential for health benefits in terms of plasma lipids and gut health. Paired plasma samples were analysed using Afinion lipid panels (total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol) and paired stool samples were analysed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine bacterial diversity within the gut microbiome. Results: Among participants providing fasting blood samples before and after the intervention (n = 47), consumption of herbal rhubarb root tea and green tea significantly lowered total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol (p < 0.05) in plasma after 21 days of daily consumption when compared with concentrations before the intervention. No significant change was observed in the senna tea group. In participants providing stool samples (n = 48), no significant differences in overall microbial composition were observed between pre- and post-intervention, even at the genus level. While no significant changes in overall microbial composition were observed, specific bacterial genera, such as Dorea spp., showed correlations with LDL cholesterol concentrations, suggesting potential microbiota-mediated effects of tea consumption. Diet and BMI was maintained in each of the three groups before and after the trial. Conclusions: It was found that drinking a cup of rhubarb root herbal or green tea infusion for 21 days produced beneficial effects on lipid profiles and maintained gut eubiosis without observable adverse effects in a healthy human cohort. More studies are needed to fully understand the effects of rhubarb root and green tea in fatty acid metabolism and gut microbial composition."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pu-erh tea, a dark tea from China, is classified into raw and ripened types. Both have significant anti-obesity effects. Polyphenols are among their major bioactive components. This study aimed to explore the anti-obesity properties and mechanisms of raw (R-TP) and ripened (F-TP) Pu-erh tea polyphenols. RESULTS: The results showed that R-TP and F-TP significantly reduced body weight, improved insulin resistance, and enhanced glucose and lipid metabolism in high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Mild differences were observed in their impact on fat metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammation levels. Both R-TP and F-TP were able to restore the disrupted intestinal flora caused by HFD treatment, returning them to a composition and levels similar to those of normal mice. Interestingly, the gut microbiota of all the mice could be reclassified into three enterotypes (enterotype Type-1, Type-2, and Type-HFD). Lactobacillaceae predominated in Type-1. Lactobacillaceae, Muribaculaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were the most common in Type-2. Type-HFD was primarily composed of Atopobiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae. The small differences in the effects of R-TP and F-TP may be due to variations in enterotypes. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that R-TP and F-TP can alleviate obesity by regulating the enterotype of gut microbiota, suggesting that they possess the potential for application in the treatment of obesity and the development of anti-obesity agents. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Theanine is a crucial indicator of tea quality, and its significance is closely tied to the economic value of tea. There have been many reports on the regulation mechanism of theanine synthesis and accumulation, but the mechanism by which gibberellin regulates theanine synthesis in tea plants is poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that the content of theanine experiences significant changes in the growth stages of tea shoots, displaying a strong correlation with gibberellin. This study confirmed that gibberellin significantly promoted the expression of the major gene of theanine synthesis, known as CsTSI. Additionally, the study identified CsWRKY71 as a transcription factor that mediated the regulation by gibberellin of theanine synthesis in tea plants. CsWRKY71 was localized in the nucleus and had a typical WRKY domain. It was a member of subclass IIC and its expression was significantly suppressed following exogenous GA3 treatment. Further assays, such as the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, dual luciferase and asODN (antisense oligodeoxynucleotide) interference, demonstrated that CsWRKY71 significantly interacted with the promoter of CsTSI, which inhibited theanine synthesis by binding to the cis-acting element (C/T)TGAC(T/C) of the CsTSI promoter. Overall, the addition of exogenous gibberellin alleviated the inhibition of CsTSI by down-regulating the expression of CsWRKY71, ultimately facilitating the rapid biosynthesis of theanine. This study elucidated the molecular mechanism of CsWRKY71-mediated gibberellin regulation of theanine synthesis in tea plant. The findings not only enhance our understanding of the regulatory processes involved in theanine synthesis in tea plants, but also provide important references for maintaining the characteristics of high theanine in the tea plant."

The results showed that tannase from Aspergillus niger was ultimately selected as the optimal enzyme to effectively increase the content of theaflavins by promoting the hydrolysis reaction and benzoylation reaction of catechins, resulting in a greater theaflavin (TF) content of 1.41%. The optimal processing conditions were found to be a fermentation time of 3 h, a fermentation temperature of 20 °C, and 1 g of tannase for 300 g of rolled tea leaves. Processing with the exogenous tannase could provide an ideal choice for the efficient utilization of summer and autumn fresh tea leaves, and could be used to develop summer and autumn black tea and to improve the content of theaflavins. It could also be used to develop deep processing of tea products with theaflavin extracts in the future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The excessive and sole use of chemical fertilizers has been found to deteriorate tea quality components. Therefore, to explore the effects of rational application of combined organic and chemical fertilizers on tea growth and quality, a pot experiment was conducted with six treatments of rational and combined organic fertilizer (OF) and chemical fertilizer (CF) which were as follows: control (no fertilizer was applied), 0OF/CF100 (only CF was applied), 25OF/75CF (25% OF + 75% CF), 50CF/50OF (50% OF + 50% CF), 75OF/25CF (75% OF + 25% CF), and 100OF/0CF (only OF was applied). The biomass of tea plant, net photosynthetic rate, chloroplast ultrastructure, and tea quality components including tea polyphenols (TPs), flavonoids, sugars, catechins, caffeine, total amino acids (TAAs), chlorophyll pigments and TP/TAA were measured. RESULTS: Compared to control, all fertilization treatments significantly improved tea growth, biomass, and quality components including soluble sugars, TAAs, catechins, caffeine, polyphenols and flavonoids in tea leaves. Among all fertilization treatments, 75OF/25CF and 50OF/50CF treatments had higher plant shoot biomass; 75OF/25CF and 100OF/0CF treatments significantly improved chloroplast ultrastructure and increased net photosynthetic rate, and had higher TAAs, polyphenols, catechins and caffeine contents; while 75OF/25CF treatment had higher sugar content and lowest TP/TAA. The principal component analysis (PCA) further explored that 75OF/25CF and 100OF/0CF treatments improved quality components in tea leaves in comparison to the application of only chemical fertilizers. CONCLUSION: The 75OF/25CF and 100OF/0CF treatments enhanced both tea growth and quality, which indicate that rational and combination of organic and chemical fertilization or organic management had high potential to improve tea growth and the production of high-yield and better-quality tea leaves. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Phages play an important role in controlling the development of bacterial diseases in plants. Previous studies have shown that the tolerance of phage-treated tea plants to bud blight was notably greater compared with that of the control group. In the present study, we determined the effect of bacteriophage therapy on physiological and biochemical parameters of tea leaves. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to analyze the cellular structure of tea leaves, and bioinformatics was used to analyze the phage. Results revealed that bacteriophage treatment can enhance the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes (CsSOD, CsCAT, and CsPOD). The levels of osmotic adjustment compounds, including proline and soluble sugars, were also elevated, suggesting that bacteriophage enhances the osmotic adjustment capacity in tea plants. TEM analysis revealed that the integrity of the cell structure of the tea leaves treated with phage was notably better compared with that of the control group. Interestingly, we also observed that the phage lysed the animal pathogen Salmonella as well as the plant pathogen P. syringae. Using NCBI BLASTn to compare the entire genome with other nucleotide sequences, we found that the phage LDT325 exhibited cross-species characteristics that had not been previously reported. In summary, our findings demonstrate that bacteriophages can protect tea plants from damage caused by bacterial diseases by regulating antioxidant systems."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excessive lipogenesis of the skin triggers some dermatological concerns, such as enlarged pores, acne, and blackheads. Although topical drug treatments can offer temporary relief, their prolonged usage may lead to side effects of dryness, irritation, or allergic reactions. Consequently, the development of safer and efficacious ingredients in cosmetics for managing sebum overproduction represents a significant yet challenging endeavor. AIM: Saponins were extracted from tea (Camellia sinensis) seed meal and purified by macroporous resin in order to investigate the impact of tea seed saponins (TSS) on lipid production in human immortalized sebaceous cells. Moreover, we attempted to reveal the underlying mechanism of TSS on the sebosuppression effect in SZ95 sebocytes stimulated by linoleic acid (LA). METHODS: The compositions and chemical structures of TSS were determined using UV-vis absorption spectrum, Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectrum, and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. An in vitro model of cellular lipid accumulation induced by LA was established. Total lipid synthesis in intracellular SZ95 sebocytes was assessed through Nile Red staining, while triglyceride, cholesterol, and fatty acids were quantified by commercially assay kits. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were employed to analyze the protein expression levels involved in the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as well as the downstream protein and mRNA expressions of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and fatty acid synthase (FAS). The localizations of SREBP-1 within the cytoplasm or nucleus were characterized using immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Five saponins were identified in the extracted TSS, all of which were oleanic acid-type pentacyclic triterpenes. TSS treatment significantly alleviated LA-induced lipid accumulation in SZ95 sebocytes. In addition, TSS activated the AMPK/mTOR pathway and downregulated the downstream protein and mRNA expression of transcription factors and enzymes, including SREBP-1, PPARγ, and FAS. Moreover, the TSS blocked the nuclear transfer of SREBP-1 from cytoplasm to nucleus. CONCLUSION: In human sebocytes, TSS exhibited sebosuppressive effect as revealed by the inhibited production of total lipids as well as triglyceride, cholesterol, and fatty acids. Moreover, the anti-lipogenesis mechanism by TSS involved the activation of the AMPK/mTOR pathway and downregulated downstream transcription factors and enzymes of SREBP-1, PPARγ, and FAS. Additionally, TSS blocked the SREBP-1 nuclear translocation. These results may justify the potent of TSS as a new candidate for modulating lipogenesis in human SZ95 sebocytes.",

      "abstract": "Oolong tea, a popular traditional Chinese tea, possesses various bioactivities, but little is known about its roles in the protection against pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, in vivo. This study investigated the roles of the water-soluble oolong tea extracts (OTE) on S. aureus infection in Caenorhabditis elegans, a promising model to study the host-microbe interactions in vivo. Pretreatment with OTE (0.6% and 1.2%) and co-treatment with OTE and S. aureus extended the lifespan by 11.16%-30.37%, increased the body bends by 36.49%-101.39%, inhibited the lipid accumulation by 11.71%-35.21% and S. aureus colonization in the intestine by 5.02%-30.68%, and enhanced the mitochondrial transmembrane potential by 51.92%-74.83%, compared with the control groups where worms were fed with S. aureus. Moreover, pretreatment with OTE and co-treatment with OTE and S. aureus suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species, increased the production of glutathione and superoxide dismutases (SODs), and altered the transcripts of genes encoding SODs, glutathione-S-transferases, and antimicrobial proteins and peptides in different ways. Furthermore, pretreatment with OTE failed to extend the lifespan of the nematode mutants defective in age-1, akt-2, skn-1, or hsf-1, and co-treatment with OTE and S. aureus could not extend the lifespan of the nematode mutants defective in age-1, akt-2, sek-1, pmk-1, mpk-1, or skn-1. These findings indicated that OTE exhibited the preventive and protective effects on S. aureus infection by increasing the antioxidant properties and expression of antimicrobial proteins and peptides via insulin/IGF-1 and/or p38/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and transcription factor SKN-1 and/or HSF-1, which implied OTE could be used as a potential food additive to prevent S. aureus infection. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Staphylococcus aureus is harmful to animal and human health, such as leading to immune system disorders. This study demonstrated that oolong tea extracts could be a potential additive used in food and feeds to protect animal and human from S. aureus infection by increasing the antioxidant properties and the expression of antimicrobial proteins and peptides.",

      "abstract": "In acidic soil conditions, aluminium (Al) limits crop growth and yields but benefits the growth of tea plants. Flavonols are suggested to form complexes with Al, enhancing Al accumulation in tea plants. The role of flavonols in promoting lateral root formation under Al stress remains unclear. Here, we identified a 7-rhamnosylated type of flavonol glycosides (F2-type) crucial for this process in tea roots. Al treatment significantly stimulated lateral root initiation and bud germination in tea plants, enhancing flavonol glycoside accumulation, particularly the F2-type. Most genes in the flavonol biosynthetic pathway were upregulated post-Al treatment, including CsUGT89AC2/3 genes, which catalyze F2-type flavonol glycosides synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of CsUGT89AC2/3 increased lateral root occurrence, flavonol glycoside accumulation and expression of biosynthetic pathway genes in tea roots. Kaempferol treatment activated flavonol pathway genes and stimulated lateral root growth. Al treatment, kaempferol treatment and CsUGT89AC3 overexpression accelerated auxin accumulation and expression of auxin-related genes. Therefore, Al stimulates flavonol biosynthetic pathway gene expression, regulates F2-type flavonol biosynthesis, and influences auxin homoeostasis, promoting lateral root formation in tea plants. These findings lay the foundation for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying the Al-mediated promotion of lateral root initiation in tea plants.",

      "abstract": "Purple tea (Camellia sinensis var. assamica) is a distinct variety of Camellia sinensis known for its bioactive compounds, including caffeine, catechins, and a unique compound called 1,2-di-Galloyl-4,6-Hexahydroxydiphenoyl-β-D-Glucose, (GHG) found predominantly in purple tea leaves, which shows potential in obesity management. Studies have indicated that these bioactive compounds play a significant role in reducing BMI and body weight among obese patients. This review focuses on how GHG impacts body weight and BMI in obese patients. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using Science Direct, Semantic Scholar, Wiley, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases up to 2024. The search employed both single keywords (e.g., 'purple tea', 'GHG', 'obesity') and multiple keyword combinations (e.g., 'purple tea and obesity', 'GHG and weight loss') related to purple tea, GHG, obesity, BMI, and clinical studies. The database search yielded 246 articles, with 173 articles retained after removing duplicates and studies published before 1999. This systematic approach aimed to gather comprehensive data on the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and potential therapeutic applications of purple tea. The investigation revealed that GHG operates through multiple mechanisms, such as inhibiting pancreatic lipase to reduce fat absorption, suppressing adipogenesis and lipogenesis, and preventing fatty tissue formation. Clinical investigations demonstrated significant reductions in BMI, waist circumference, and body weight among individuals consuming purple tea extracts with high GHG levels. Additional metabolic benefits include increased energy expenditure, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced glucose metabolism regulation. While more comprehensive research is needed to fully elucidate the optimal dosage and long-term effects, current evidence suggests that GHG from purple tea could be a valuable natural intervention in the multifaceted approach to obesity management."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kombucha, a fermented beverage obtained from a Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast, has shown potential in modulating gut microbiota, although no clinical trials have been done. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the effects of regular black tea kombucha consumption on intestinal health in individuals with and without obesity. METHODS: A pre-post clinical intervention study was conducted lasting 8 wk. Forty-six participants were allocated into 2 groups: normal weight + black tea kombucha (n = 23); and obese + black tea kombucha (n = 23). Blood, urine, and stool samples were collected at baseline (T0) and after 8 wk of intervention (T8). RESULTS: A total of 145 phenolic compounds were identified in the kombucha, primarily flavonoids (81%) and phenolic acids (19%). Kombucha favored commensal bacteria such as Bacteroidota and Akkermanciaceae, especially in the obese group. Subdoligranulum, a butyrate producer, also increased in the obese group after kombucha consumption (P = 0.031). Obesity-associated genera Ruminococcus and Dorea were elevated in the obese group at baseline (P < 0.05) and reduced after kombucha consumption, becoming similar to the normal weight group (Ruminococcus: obese T8 × normal weight T8: P = 0.27; Dorea: obese T8 × normal weight T0: P = 0.57; obese T8 × normal weight T8: P = 0.32). Fungal diversity increased, with a greater abundance of Saccharomyces in both groups and reductions in Exophiala and Rhodotorula, particularly in the obese group. Pichia and Dekkera, key microorganisms in kombucha, were identified as biomarkers after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Regular kombucha consumption positively influenced gut microbiota in both normal and obese groups, with more pronounced effects in the obese group, suggesting that it may be especially beneficial for those individuals. This trial was registered at Brazilian Clinical Trial Registry - ReBEC as UTN code U1111-1263-9550 (https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-9832wsx)."

      "abstract": "Cold stress significantly limits the growth and yield of tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze), particularly in northern China, may lead to huge economic losses. Glycine betaine (GB), an osmotic regulator, is widely applied in crop resistance to abiotic stress. This study investigates the role of GB and its biosynthetic enzyme CsBADH in enhancing cold tolerance in tea plants. Two cultivars, 'Shuchazao' (cold-resistant) and 'Baiye 1' (cold-sensitive), were subjected to low temperature stress (0 °C). GB accumulation was measured, revealing that 'Shuchazao' exhibited 1.4-fold higher GB levels than 'Baiye 1', suggesting a link between higher GB accumulation and cold tolerance. Exogenous GB treatment improved cold resistance, especially in the cold-sensitive cultivar 'Baiye 1'. The CsBADH gene, a key enzyme in GB biosynthesis, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, confirming its activity. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, and C. sinensis plants overexpressing CsBADH showed increased GB levels (1.5- to 2.4-fold), proline content, peroxidase (POD) activities, and enhanced cold tolerance, while silencing CsBADH decreased GB accumulation and cold resistance. These findings demonstrate that CsBADH plays a critical role in cold stress response by promoting GB accumulation, offering potential strategies for improving the resilience of tea and other leaf crops to cold stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adventitious root (AR) formation is the key step for successful cutting propagation of tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.). Studies showed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) can promote the rooting ability, and auxin pathway in basal stem of cuttings was involved in this process. However, auxin and abscisic acid (another important regulator on AR formation) in the other parts of cuttings at different rooting stages responding to AMF inoculation are not well studied. Therefore, in this paper, contents, enzymes and genes related to these two plant hormones were comprehensively determined aiming to unveil how endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) involve in the AMF regulating AR development of tea cuttings. RESULTS: Inoculating with AMF significantly increased the proportion of cuttings at S2 stage (AR formation), which was more than twice as much as the control. And the total rooting rate in mycorrhizal treatment was also higher than that in the control with an increase of 8.66%. Enzyme activity assays showed that except for decreased polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity at the S3 stage and peroxidase (POD) activity in middle stem of S3 stage, AMF inoculation increased activities of POD, PPO, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to varying degrees in leaf, middle stem and basal stem of tea cuttings. After inoculation with AMF, the indoleacetic acid oxidase (IAAO) activity decreased to a certain extent in the first three stages of tea cuttings, which showed a trend of 'low-high-low' in the basal stem of all treatments. Besides, there was a significantly positive correlation between SOD activity and AR formation, especially for the proportion of cuttings at S2 and S3 stages. Higher IAA level and IAA/ABA ratio was found in basal stem of cuttings at S1 stage induced by AMF, which promoting the AR formation as revealed by correlation analysis. At the same time, AMF significantly elevated the level of IAA in leaf at S1 stage. By screening differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to IAA and ABA pathways, together with redundant analysis, it was indicated that auxin biosynthesis and transport, as well as ABA transport and signal transduction, were involved in AMF regulating the rooting of tea cuttings. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, both endogenous IAA and ABA played roles in the regulation of AR formation of tea cuttings by AMF inoculating, enriching the theoretical basis of AMF regulating rooting of cuttings and providing foundations for cutting propagation of tea plants.",

      "abstract": "Cold significantly impacts the growth and development of tea plants, thereby affecting their economic value. Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are thought to play a pivotal role in signaling the plant's response to cold and regulating cold tolerance. Among the RLK subfamilies, wall-associated receptor-like kinases (WAKs) have been investigated across various plant species and have been shown to regulate cell growth and stress responses. However, the function of WAK genes in response to cold stress in tea has yet to be studied. In a previous investigation, we identified the WAK gene family from Camellia sinensis and isolated a specific WAK gene, CsWAK12, which is induced by abiotic stresses. Here, we demonstrate that CsWAK12 is involved in the regulation of cold tolerance in tea plants. CsWAK12 was rapidly induced by cold, peaking at 3 hours after treatment at 4°C (10-fold increase). Heterologous overexpression of CsWAK12 (35S:CsWAK12) in Arabidopsis promoted plant growth by enhancing root length and seed size under normal conditions, although it reduced cold resistance compared to the wild type. Under cold stress, the transgenic plants exhibited a lower survival rate and significantly altered levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content compared to the wild type (WT). Furthermore, the expression of C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding factor (CBF) genes was diminished in CsWAK12-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants following cold treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes associated with the CBF pathway, such as transcription factor genes (ERF53, ERF54, and DREB2A) were markedly reduced in the overexpression line. These data suggest that CsWAK12 acts as a negative regulator, reducing the cold tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis by mediating the CBF pathway. Therefore, CsWAK12 may serve as a candidate gene for the molecular breeding of cold resistance in tea plants."

Subsequently, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were employed to explore the potential active ingredients and mechanisms of action in combating hypertension (HTN). This study identified eight key chemical constituents of the three teas, with significant differences in their contents. Yunnan Pu'er tea exhibited superior endurance for multiple infusions compared to the other teas. The research results clearly distinguished the three teas, with key components contributing to quality disparities identified as PCA, GC, gallic acid, and caffeine. The tea exerts anti-HTN effects through multiple pathways. The results of eight chemical components and core targets related to HTN exhibited favorable binding affinities. Our study suggested that Da Hong Pao, Zunyi black tea, and Yunnan Pu'er tea exhibit certain quality differences, and the overall quality of Yunnan Pu'er tea surpasses that of the other teas, though specific differences require further investigation. Moreover, the eight identified components from the three teas are all active components in combating HTN, and network pharmacology comprehensively elucidates the mechanism of tea's anti-hypertensive effect. These findings provide more potential key targets for the treatment of HTN by drinking tea.

TPS is an acidic heteropolysaccharide containing rhamnose, arabinose, galactose, glucose (Glc), xylose, mannose, galacturonic acid, and guluronic acid. We found that TPS supplementation partially reversed the elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in high-fat diet (HD)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mice (p < 0.05), and hepatic steatosis and impaired Glc tolerance were also ameliorated. After HD intervention, the activity of Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream genes, including Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), was significantly inhibited (p < 0.05). TPS can increase the expression of these genes. The hepatoprotective effects of TPS in AMPK-/- mice almost completely disappeared. Moreover, the expression levels of SIRT1, SREBP1c, ACC1, and ATGL did not significantly change after TPS supplementation (p > 0.05). Therefore, our findings suggest that TPS protects the liver from hepatic glucolipid metabolism disorders in HD-induced NAFLD mice by activating AMPK-mediated signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "To solve the problems that the response of nitrous oxide （N2O） emissions to warming may be different in different biological communities and the uncertainty of its response to warming may be aggravated by the high heterogeneity of tea plantation soils, an incubation experiment at five elevations of tea plantation soils [537 m（E1）, 433 m（E2）, 350 m（E3）, 308 m（E4）, and 238 m（E5）] and three temperatures （15, 25, and 30 ℃） was conducted for 35 days to explore the temperature sensitivity of N2O in different tea plantation soils and the driving factors. The results showed that elevated temperature could promote soil N2O emissions at different elevations, but the effect was inconsistent at different elevations. Specifically, elevated temperature decreased the cumulative N2O emissions in the E1 treatment, but the difference was not significant. At the same time, the cumulative N2O emissions in the E2-E5 treatments were increased, especially in the E3-E5 treatments. The Q10 values of N2O in the tea plantation soils at different elevations were significantly different, ranging from 0.90 to 4.98, with E4 &gt; E5 &gt; E3 &gt; E2 &gt; E1. The multiple regression model analysis showed that 97.4% of the variation in N2O temperature sensitivity was explained by soil physicochemistry and microorganisms, and N2O temperature sensitivity was significantly positively correlated with bacterial beta diversity PCoA1. In conclusion, increasing temperature can promote the N2O emissions in tea plantation soils at different elevations, but there is no consistent change rule between elevation and N2O temperature sensitivity, and N2O temperature sensitivity is mainly affected by the bacterial beta diversity.",

      "abstract": "Intensification of poultry industry has led to a surge in animal product output, but this has also revealed issues with environmental management in poultry houses, particularly the harmful effects of high hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels on poultry health. The study aimed to assess the therapeutic impact of tea tree oil (TTO) on H2S-induced spleen and intestinal injuries in chickens. A total of 240 one-day-old Lohmann Brown chicks were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (CON), the H2S exposure group (AVG), and the TTO treatment group (TTG), with four replicates, each consisting of 20 chicks. The experiment lasted 42 days. Results showed that TTO treatment alleviated tissue damage in the thymus, kidneys, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius, and improved the organ index (P < 0.05) compared with the AVG. Serum analysis revealed that TTO lowered levels of alanine aminotransferase(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), triglycerides(TG), CD3 positive CD4 positive T cells(CD3+CD4+), CD4 positive to CD8 positive Rratio(CD4+/CD8+), and alkaline phosphatase(AKP), while increasing albumin(ALB), globulin(GLO), immunoglobulin A(IgA), and immunoglobulin G(IgG) levels (P < 0.05). Intestinal findings indicated that TTO treatment enhanced villus height, reduced crypt depth, and upregulated the expression of Claudin 1, Occludin, and ZO-1 mRNA in the jejunum (P < 0.05). After TTO treatment, H2S-induced oxidative stress injury and apoptosis protein expression in spleen were improved (P < 0.05). TTO also reduced interferon-γ(INF-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and interleukin-1β(IL-1β) proteins (P < 0.05), while raising CD3+CD8+ T-cell subsets (P < 0.05). Compared with CON, TTO treatment alleviated serum biochemical disorders and intestinal damage caused by H2S exposure and restored them to normal (P > 0.05). In conclusion, TTO can improve spleen and intestinal function and reduce the effects of H2S on growth performance and health of chickens.",

      "abstract": "Green tea seed oil (GTSO; Camellia sinensis) is rich in bioactive compounds and has great potential for preventing intestinal inflammation. Conversely, high-fat diets have been shown to promote or aggravate gastrointestinal inflammation, and the bioactive ingredients of GTSO face difficulty passing through the gastrointestinal tract while remaining intact. This study employed whey protein isolate (WPI) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) to prepare a GTSO-loaded double-layer emulsion. The optimal parameters were as follows: WPI (2% w/w) and 35% oil phase for the primary emulsion preparation, CMC-Na (0.8% w/w) for the final emulsion, and 450 W of ultrasonic power for homogenization. No significant changes in particle size or coalescence in the emulsions were observed after 30 days of storage at 4°C. In addition, in a simulated gastrointestinal digestion system, more than 60% of the encapsulated GTSO was able to remain intact while passing through the gastric and small intestinal environment. In mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, pretreatment with the GTSO emulsion significantly prevented the further development of colitis, whereas an empty-carrier-plus-free-GTSO treatment had no such protective effects and even tended to aggravate the disease. The results of the present study suggest that encapsulated GTSO is a reliable alternative approach for colitis prevention. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The green tea seed oil-loaded double-layer emulsion demonstrates good storage stability when kept at 4°C, exhibits excellent slow-release performance, and achieves superior outcomes in the prevention of colitis. Our current study provides a reliable alternative approach for the prevention of colitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Phenolic tannins, which are ubiquitous in plants, exhibit diverse biological activities and have drawn significant attention for their potential impact on ruminant nutrition and health. Although phenolic tannins have beneficial and detrimental effects on rumen fermentation, their precise influence remains poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the effects of varying doses of green tea extract (GTE) on rumen fermentation parameters through an in vitro trial using sheep rumen liquids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 4 × 2 factorial design was used to test the effect of 4 different doses of GTE treatment (0, 140, 280, and 560 mg/kg) in 2 different in vitro runs on degradability, fermentation profiles, and gas production using the in vitro Hohenheim Gas Test method. RESULTS: Across running times, the GTE-treated diet did not affect (p > 0.05) dry matter degradability % and organic matter degradability %, pH, ammonia (NH3-N, mg/dL), 24 h total gas production (tGP 24h, mL), and acetate-to-propionate ratio (A: P), but it reduced (p < 0.05) tGP 6 h compared with GTE-0 (control diet without GTE). GTE treatment tended to reduce (p < 0.1) methane (CH4, % LEL) and total volatile Fatty Acids (tVFA, mM). Across GTE treatment, the 1st in vitro run had higher (p < 0.001) tGP 6-24 h and pH, but lower (p < 0.001) tVFA and A: P in comparison with the 2nd in vitro run. CONCLUSION: GTE treatment tends to decrease CH4 output in rumen without affecting degradability, tGP, and most fermentation profiles, except for a tendency to reduce tVFA."

      "abstract": "Although ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) has been obtained from green tea residue mesophyll cells (TRMCs), its intact release has not yet been achieved. To release RuBisCO, this study employed a combination or sequential treatments using urea, β-mercaptoethanol, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and enzymes. Factors that hindered RuBisCO release from TRMCs were investigated through SDS-PAGE analysis, protein release quantification, and electron microscopy techniques. Alkali treatment of TRMCs at 95 °C facilitated protein release, while also causing protein modification or degradation. Conversely, the combined treatment of β-mercaptoethanol with urea and/or SDS could effectively disrupt the disulfide bonds, hydrogen bonds, and/or hydrophobic interactions within the cells, leading to the release of 40% or more of the proteins. This treatment showed strong electrophoretic bands at 55 and 15 kDa, indicating that RuBisCO was completely released. No protein was released during the treatment with SDS and pepsin/papain/alkaline protease, indicating that RuBisCO was hindered by the presence of cellulose and hemicellulose. Sequential treatment with SDS and Viscozyme L dissolved TRMC lignocellulose without releasing RuBisCO, suggesting the low solubility of RuBisCO. Overall, the presence of lignocellulose in the cell wall and the low solubility of RuBisCO were identified as key factors hindering its release from the TRMCs.",

      "abstract": "Theaflavins, powerful antioxidants found in black tea ( Camellia sinensis ), have garnered increasing interest for their promising therapeutic potential. Experimental studies have contributed to enlightening about the advantages of theaflavins, including their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiosteoporosis, and antimicrobial properties. Theaflavin and its derivatives, particularly theaflavin-3,3'-digallate, have been particularly noted for their enhanced action in different areas. These compounds have found an important role as alternatives or adjuvants in the pharmaceutical sector, food industry, and in the improvement of health conditions. This review focuses on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory aspects of theaflavins, particularly their potential in addressing peri-implant osteolysis. We explore mechanisms and pathways involved in this therapeutic action. Furthermore, we cover some of the relevant studies on the antimicrobial action of theaflavins in both the health and food sectors. Specifically, we explore the use of theaflavins for the treatment of dental infections, where these compounds have shown particular efficacy against several bacterial strains and their antimicrobial application in food matrices. Given the low solubility and stability of theaflavins in physiological conditions, we emphasize the benefits of the development of biocompatible and biodegradable nanoformulations to enhance the stability, bioavailability, and efficacy of these polyphenols, to promote their broader research and application. Given the potential demonstrated so far by in vitro and in vivo studies, the application of theaflavins stands as a promising alternative to enhance the existing strategies and fight prosthetic failure and antimicrobial resistance in the health and food sectors.",

      "abstract": "Depression, anxiety and sleep disorders are prevalent psychiatric conditions worldwide, significantly impacting the physical and mental well-being of individuals. The treatment of these conditions poses various challenges, including limited efficacy and potential side effects. Tea, a globally recognized healthful beverage, contains a variety of active compounds. Studies have shown that consuming tea or ingesting its certain active ingredients have a beneficial impact on the mental health issues mentioned above. While the effects of tea on physical health are well-documented, there remains a gap in our systematic understanding of its impact on mental health. This article offers a thorough overview of animal, clinical, and epidemiological studies examining tea and its components in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, and summarizes the associated molecular mechanisms. The active ingredients in tea, including L-theanine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), arginine, catechins, theaflavins, caffeine, theacrine, and several volatile compounds, may help improve depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. The underlying molecular mechanisms involve the regulation of neurotransmitters, including monoamines, GABA, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as the suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation. Additionally, these ingredients may influence the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This review provides valuable insights into the effects and mechanisms by which tea and its components regulate depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, laying the groundwork for further research into relevant mechanisms and the development of tea-based mental health products.",

WRKY transcription factors are key in plant abiotic stress responses, yet the role of CsWRKY29 in freezing tolerance is unclear. In this study, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and transient green fluorescent protein assay revealed that CsWRKY29 localizes to the nucleus and its expression is induced by cold and abscisic acid (ABA). CsWRKY29 overexpression in Arabidopsis enhanced freezing tolerance, reduced electrolyte leakage, increased soluble sugars, and boosted superoxide dismutase activity, with upregulated COR genes. These lines also showed heightened ABA and glucose sensitivity. Cold treatment of CsWRKY29-overexpressing lines upregulated AtABI5, AtHXK1, and AtSUS4 compared to wild type, and yeast one-hybrid assays confirmed CsWRKY29 binding to the W-box in the CsABI5 promoter. Furthermore, the application of virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technology to reduce CsWRKY29 expression in tea plants revealed a significant decrease in the transcript levels of CsCBFs, CsABI5, CsHXK1, and CsSUS4 in the silenced plants. In summary, our findings indicate that CsWRKY29 may serve as a critical transcription factor that contributes to freezing tolerance, ABA responsiveness, and sugar metabolism within tea plants.",

Dual-temperature molecular dynamic simulations, alongside multi-experimental methods, were employed to tandemly explore the intervention effect and mechanism of tea saponin (TS, 0 %-40 % w/w) on these behaviors. The findings reveal that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends of TS provide numerous sites for hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance, respectively, which hinder the formation of hydrogen bonds between starch chains. This interaction mode facilitated the chain unwinding (pasting temperature: 79.8 → 76.4 °C) and movement (viscosity: 267.67 → 38.92 Pa.s), and also retarded chain short/long-term reassociation (elastic modulus: 0.41 → 0.14 Pa/min; hardening rate: 2.72 → 0.07 gf/d) and rearrangement (hardness: 15.50 → 10.00 gf). Notably, a critical TS content was observed between 10 % and 20 % w/w, beyond which textural collapse (hardness: 15.50 → 10.00 gf) occurred. This research offers a new strategy and relevant theoretical backing for the property regulation of starch products.",

The GTME's phytochemical composition was identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the extract's capacity to lower cellular proliferation and cause apoptosis in HepG2 cancerous liver cell lines was checked. RESULTS: The findings of the gas chromatography-mass chromatogram showed that GTME included bioactive antioxidants and anticancer substances. Additionally, utilizing the MTT, comet assay, and acridine assay, GTME revealed a selective cytotoxic impact with a significant IC50 value (27.3 µg/ml) on HepG2 cells without any harmful effects on WI-38 healthy cells. Also, compared to untreated cells, the extract-treated HepG2 cells had an upsurge in the proportion of cells that have undergone apoptosis and displayed a comet nucleus, which is a sign of DNA damage. In addition, HepG2 cells treated with GTME revealed a stop in the G1 phase and sub-G1 apoptotic cells (37.32%) in a flow cytometry analysis. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species were shown to be responsible for HepG2 apoptosis, and the tested extract significantly reduced their levels in the treated cells. Lastly, compared to untreated cells in treated HepG2 cells, GTME significantly changed protein expression levels linked with cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These findings provided information about the processes through which the GTME inhibited the growth of HepG2. Therefore, it has potential as an effective natural therapy for the treatment of human liver cancer. However, to validate these findings, animal models must be used for in vivo studies.",

      "abstract": "Green tea, derived from Camellia sinensis, contains polyphenolic active compounds that exhibit diverse pharmacological effects including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. Employing various concentrations of green tea polyphenols (GTPs; 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 μg∕mL), human normal lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (A549) underwent treatment. The cell viability was assessed using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, proliferation was examined through the colony formation assay, apoptosis was monitored via flow cytometry, cell migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin) were determined by Western blot. A549 cells were subjected to Cisplatin (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 μM) and X-ray irradiation (0, 2, 4, 6 Gy) for treatment to probe the influence of GTPs on A549 cells in response to chemoradiotherapy. The functioning mechanism of GTPs in the context of NSCLC was validated using lithium chloride (LiCl) [a glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) inhibitor], which activates the Wnt∕β-catenin pathway. GTPs suppressed NSCLC cell viability in a concentration-dependent pattern, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 362.5 μg∕mL, while showing little impact on BEAS-2B cells' viability (at concentrations not exceeding 500 μg∕mL). Treatment with GTPs dampened colony formation of NSCLC cells, while promoting apoptosis. LiCl treatment vigorously attenuated the inhibitory impact of GTPs on the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells. Mechanistic studies suggested that GTPs strengthened GSK-3β stability, thereby impeding the Wnt∕β-catenin pathway. Tea polyphenols (TPs) in conjunction with concurrent radiochemotherapy (CRCT) enhance the stability of GSK-3β and dampen the Wnt∕β-catenin pathway, hence exerting anticancer effects in NSCLC.",

In this study, the effects of Liubao tea extract (LTE) on obesity-related hyperlipidemia and the potential mechanism involved were explored. Anti-obesity compounds such as tricetin, isovitexin, tiliroside, etc. in LTE were identified. In high-fat diet mouse models, LTE effectively reduced tissues, organs, and body weight growth, and restored abnormal serum lipid levels. LTE could reverse adipocyte enlargement, lipid accumulation, and hepatic microstructure abnormalities. Notably, LTE reshaped gut microbiota by boosting beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides, Akkermansia, Psychrobacter) and suppressing harmful bacteria (e.g., Dubosiella, Faecalibaculum). Spearman correlation analysis unveiled significant associations between serum lipid levels, weight gain, LTE dosage, and gut microbiota, underlining the modulatory effects of LTE on metabolic disorders via the regulation of intestinal microbiota. Collectively, LTE could serve as a potential therapy for obesity-related hyperlipidemia prevention.",

      "abstract": "Strigolactones (SLs) are known to regulate plant architecture formation, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) responses, and secondary metabolism, but their effects in tea plants remain unclear. We demonstrated that the application of a bioactive SL analogue GR24 either to tea roots or leaves initially stimulated but later inhibited catechins, theanine, and caffeine biosynthesis. GR24 treatment also promoted the accumulation of flavonols and insoluble proanthocyanidins in a time- and dose-dependent manner. GR24 influenced flavonoid and theanine biosynthesis genes, such as up-regulating CsTT2c, CsMYB12, and CsbZIP1, modulating N-responsive and assimilation genes (CsNRT1,1, CsGSI/TS1, CsHRS1, CsPHR1, CsNLA1, and CsLBD37/38/39), and repressing N/P transport and signaling genes (CsPHO2, CsPHT1s, CsNRT2,2, CsHHO1, and CsWRKY38). GR24-induced changes in secondary metabolites were also observed in the leaves of tea plants. GR24-regulated CsLBD37a interacted with CsTT8a and CsTT2c, repressing catechins biosynthesis by interrupting MBW complex formation. GR24 regulated caffeine biosynthesis and regulator genes CsS40 and CsNAC7 and may thereby suppress caffeine production. GR24 altered the transcriptomic profiles of multiple hormone biosynthesis and signaling genes that potentially regulate tea characteristic metabolism and N/P signaling. This study provides new insights into SL-induced transcriptional reprogramming that leads to changes in N/P nutrition, secondary metabolism, and hormone signaling in tea plants.",

      "abstract": "Monomeric flavan-3-ols and their oligomeric forms, proanthocyanidins (PAs), are closely related to the bitterness of tea beverages. Monomeric flavan-3-ols are characteristic flavor compounds in tea. Increasing the content of PAs and anthocyanins enhances the resistance of tea plants to pathogen invasion but decreases the quality of tea beverages. MATE family transporters play a critical role in transferring monomeric flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins into vacuoles for storage or subsequent condensation into PAs. Their activities modulate the ratio of monomeric flavan-3-ols to PAs and increase anthocyanin content in tea plants. In this study, it was observed that the gene expression and protein phosphorylation level of the MATE transporter CsTT12, a vacuole-localized flavonoid transporter, were notably upregulated following exogenous sucrose treatment, promoting PA synthesis in tea plants. Further analysis revealed that overexpression of CsTT12 and CsTT12S17D significantly increased the content of anthocyanins and PAs in plants, whereas CsTT12S17A did not. In CsTT12 knockdown plants, PA's accumulation decreased significantly, while monomeric catechin content increased. Moreover, phosphorylation modification enhanced the vacuolar membrane localization of CsTT12, whereas dephosphorylation weakened its vacuolar membrane localization. This study uncovers the crucial role of phosphorylation in flavonoid biosynthesis and provides insights into balancing quality improvements and resistance enhancement.",

      "abstract": "Tea is obtained from the young leaves and shoots of the evergreen perennial plant Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, the most popular and frequently consumed product using a natural beverage worldwide. Some kinds of tea products, such as green tea, black tea, and oolong tea, have assorted flavors depending on the manufacturing techniques. Green tea has been studied for many years for its important beneficial effects, including anticancer, anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and cardiovascular effects. These effects are primarily associated with tea polyphenols, and regular consumption has been re-ported to decrease the incidence of some chronic diseases. Current studies support that green tea catechins play an important role in healing and improving the pathology of many diseases. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most a highly found polyphenol in the leaves and is of great interest for its protective role in the prevention of diseases. Therefore, this review presents the efficacy and possible mechanisms of EGCG against sexually transmitted viruses. Moreover, EGCG and its derivatives are recognized as safe bioactive phytochemicals for external and internal use in preventing and treating viral STIs and other concurrent infections. Multidisciplinary studies are essential to discover cheaper, safer, and more effective treat-ments using EGCG and its derivatives to improve the toxicity and formulations of viral STI medications."

The evaluation reveals that (a) B. subtilis can directly suppress the growth of plant pathogens (b) in the in vitro evaluation; the B. subtilis suppressed the growth of the Fusarium ambrossium, which is the nourishment for the ambrosia beetle, (c) it also revealed that the antagonistic microbes and the entomopathogens are able to control the pest population of the shot hole borer of tea. The impact of B. subtilis on mycelial growth, sporulation, and spore germination of F. ambrosium in agar medium was observed. In the field condition on the post-treatment assessments shows an average decline of 40% in both foliar and soil drenching. Hence, we recommend the antagonistic bacterium B. subtilis for including as an IPM for the management of shot hole borer in tea.",

      "abstract": "Tea leaf spot caused by Didymella segeticola is a disease that has recently been discovered in the tea plantations of Southwest China and that has a significant negative impact on the yield and quality of tea leaves. Wuyiencin is a nucleotide antimicrobial that is effective against a range of fungal diseases. However, its mode of action is still unclear. The current study found that wuyiencin inhibited the mycelial growth of D. segeticola in vitro. Meanwhile, in vivo experiments confirmed that wuyiencin had a significant curative effect on tea leaf spot. Microscopic observation indicated that it damaged the organelles and nucleus in fungal cells. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR assays revealed that mycelium treated with wuyiencin at the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) dosage for 1 h exhibited 3.23 times lower expression of threonine dehydratase (td) gene, which is responsible for producing pyruvate. The wild-type (WT) strain had a 1.77-fold higher pyruvate concentration than that in the td mutant (P < 0.05). The td mutant was more sensitive than the WT to wuyiencin treatment, with the EC50 value in the td mutant being 30.01 μg/ml compared with 82.34 μg/ml in the WT. Molecular docking demonstrated that wuyiencin bound to td, with a binding energy of -10.47 kcal/mol. Compared with the WT strain, wuyiencin significantly reduced ATP concentration of the td mutant strain at dosages of 80.0 and 160.0 µg/ml. In total, wuyiencin reduced td activity, inhibited pyruvate production, and decreased ATP content in the phytopathogenic fungus, ultimately disturbing the growth of the mycelium.",

However, the regulatory mechanism of temperature-dependent changes in photosynthetic pigment contents and the resultant leaf colors remain unclear. Here, we examined the chloroplast microstructure, shoot phenotype, photosynthetic pigment content, and the expression of pigment synthesis-related genes in three tea genotypes with different leaf colors under different temperature conditions. The electron microscopy results revealed that all varieties experienced the most severe chloroplast damage at 15 °C, particularly in albino cultivar Baiye 1 (BY), where chloroplast basal lamellae were loosely arranged, and some chloroplasts were even empty. In contrast, the chloroplast basal lamellae at 35 °C and 25 °C were neatly arranged and well-developed, outperforming those observed at 20 °C and 15 °C. Chlorophyll and carotenoid measurements revealed a significant reduction in chlorophyll content under low temperature treatment, peaking at ambient temperature followed by high temperatures. Interestingly, BY showed remarkable tolerance to high temperatures, maintaining relatively high chlorophyll content, indicating its sensitivity primarily to low temperatures. Furthermore, the trends in gene expression related to chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolism were largely consistent with the pigment content. Correlation analysis identified key genes responsible for temperature-induced changes in these pigments, suggesting that changes in their expression likely contribute to temperature-dependent leaf color variations.",

This study investigated the efficacy of green tea and black tea extracts as natural antioxidants in Cantonese sausages to inhibit lipid and protein oxidation. RESULTS: Sausages were prepared with the addition of different concentrations - 100, 300, and 600 mg kg-1 total polyphenols (TP) - of green tea or black tea extract. Oxidation of the sausages was assessed through thiobarbituric acid reactants, carbonyl content, and thiol content, whereas consumer acceptability was evaluated based on texture, color, and sensory analysis. The tea extracts inhibited malondialdehyde production and reduced the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance value from 23.72 mmol MDA g-1 to less than 1.94 mmol MDA g-1. However, the addition of tea extracts decreased the thiol content and caused the loss of myosin heavy chain and actin bonds in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Although the addition of tea extracts increased the redness and hardness of the sausage, no significant difference in consumer acceptance between the control and treatment groups was observed in the sensory analysis. CONCLUSION: The tea extract inhibited the oxidation of lipids in Cantonese sausage. There was no negative effect on the sensory characteristics of sausages. The use of tea extracts as natural antioxidants in Cantonese sausage is therefore feasible. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Passion fruit often suffers from quality degradation primarily due to peel wrinkling after harvest. Tea polyphenols (TPs) hold potential for enhancing postharvest preservation. However, the specific effects of TPs coating on preservation of passion fruit, as well as the underlying mechanisms involving cuticle regulation, have not been thoroughly investigated. This study demonstrated that treating 'Qinmi no.9' passion fruit with TPs at a concentration of 0.1 g L-1 significantly mitigates weight loss, maintains firmness, and reduces cell membrane permeability during storage at 10 °C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that TPs treatment notably enhances cuticle thickness and structural integrity. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and metabolomics analyses indicated that TPs treatment obviously promotes the accumulation of palmitic acid, stearic acid, and their derivatives-primarily 12-Octadecenoic acid and 10(E)-Octadecenoic acid-as well as increases the levels of 11-Octadecenoic acid, primary alcohols such as 1-Eicosanol, and long-chain alkanes (including C31 and C32 alkanes) in the fruit peel cuticle. These biochemical changes contribute to the quality maintenance of passion fruit during cold storage. The findings suggest that TPs treatment is a promising biological strategy for extending shelf life and mitigating quality degradation by regulating cuticle metabolism in postharvest passion fruit.",

Mn-cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family genes have been implicated in regulating Mn homeostasis and tolerance. However, the mechanism of Mn tolerance of tea plants in acidic environments is still unknown. In this study, we initially examined the phenotypic characteristics and Mn contents variability in different tissues of tea plants under various Mn concentration at pH 5 and 4. We observed that tea plants exhibited remarkably high Mn tolerance at pH 4, with Mn accumulation notably elevated in the aboveground tissues under pH 4 condition after 28-day treatment. We found the expression levels of Mn-CDF genes, had different subcellular localization, were tissue-specific and significantly induced by high Mn concentrations at pH 4 condition. Furthermore, the yeast complementation assays indicated that the heterologous expression of Mn-CDF genes restored the growth of a Mn2+ sensitive yeast strain, Δpmr1. Taken together, these results suggest that Mn-CDF family genes function as Mn transporters to participate in Mn tolerance in acidic environments. This study provides reference for further study on the mechanism of maintaining Mn homeostasis in tea plants under soil acidification.",

This study investigates the therapeutic potential of green tea extract (GTE) in mitigating these adverse effects. METHODS: A total of 24 male Wistar albino rats were used in this study and divided into the control group (n = 8), Chronic-REM Sleep Deprivation (CRSD) Group (n = 8) and Chronic-REM SD + Green Tea 200 (CRSD + GTE200) Group (n = 8). After 21 days, a comprehensive analysis of paraoxonase (PON1), arylesterase (ARE), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NOx), proinflammatory cytokines, and lipid profiles in aortic tissue, heart tissue, and serum was conducted in a sleep-deprived rat model. RESULTS: Chronic REM sleep deprivation led to a significant reduction in PON1 and ARE levels in aortic (p = 0.046, p = 0.035 respectively) and heart tissues (p = 0.020, p = 0.019 respectively), indicative of compromised antioxidant defenses. MDA levels increased, and NOx levels decreased, suggesting oxidative stress and impaired vascular function. Lipid profile alterations, including increased triglycerides and total cholesterol, were observed in serum. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) further indicated an inflammatory response (p = 0.007, p = 0.018 respectively). GTE administration demonstrated a protective role, restoring antioxidant enzyme levels, suppressing lipid peroxidation, and improving NOx levels. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of GTE in alleviating the cardiovascular impairments of chronic REM sleep deprivation, emphasizing its candidacy for further clinical exploration as a natural intervention in sleep-related disorders and associated cardiovascular risks.",

      "abstract": "The development and quality of tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze.) are greatly hampered by drought stress (DS), which affects them in a number of ways, including by interfering with their metabolism of nitrogen (N). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are known to enhance water and nutrient absorption in plants, but their specific effects on tea plant N metabolism under DS and the associated regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Claroideoglomus etunicatum inoculation on N assimilation in tea plants (C. sinensis cv. Fuding Dabaicha) under well-watered (WW) and DS conditions, and to explore potential molecular mechanisms. After 8 weeks of DS treatment, root mycorrhizal colonization was significantly inhibited, and the biomass of tea shoots and roots, as well as the contents of various amino acids (AAs) were reduced. However, AMF inoculation significantly increased the contents of tea polyphenols and catechins in leaves by 13.74%-36.90% under both WW and DS conditions. Additionally, mycorrhizal colonization notably increased N content by 12.65%-35.70%, various AAs by 11.88%-325.42%, and enzymatic activities associated with N metabolism by 3.80%-147.62% in both leaves and roots. Gene expression analysis revealed a universal upregulation of N assimilation-related genes (CsAMT1;2, CsAMT3;1, CsGS1, CsNADH-GOGAT, CsTS2, CsGGT1, and CsADC) in AMF-colonized tea roots, regardless of water status. Under DS condition, AMF inoculation significantly upregulated the expressions of CsNRT1;2, CsNRT1;5, CsNRT2;5, CsNR, CsGS1, CsGDH1, CsGDH2, CsTS2, CsGGT1, CsGGT3, and CsSAMDC in tea leaves. These findings suggest that AMF improved tea plant adaptability to DS by enhancing N absorption and assimilation, accompanied by the synthesis and accumulation of various AAs, such as Glu, Gln, Asp, Lys, Arg, GABA and Pro. This is achieved through the upregulation of N metabolism-related genes and the activation of related enzymes in tea plants under DS condition. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of AMF in regulating tea plant N metabolism and enhancing stress tolerance."

In order to evaluate the effects of PGPR strains on tea plant growth and the rhizosphere soil microenvironment, 38 PGPR strains belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria with different growth-promoting properties were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of tea plants. Among them, two PGPR strains with the best growth-promoting properties were then selected for the root irrigation. The PGPR treatment groups had a higher Chlorophyll (Chl) concentration in the eighth leaf of tea plants and significantly promoted the plant height and major soil elements. There were significant differences in microbial diversity and metabolite profiles in the rhizosphere between different experimental groups. PGPR improved the diversity of beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms and enhanced the root metabolites through the interaction between PGPR and tea plants. The results of this research are helpful for understanding the relationship between PGPR strains, tea plant growing, and rhizosphere soil microenvironment improvement. Moreover, they could be used as guidance to develop environmentally friendly biofertilizers with the selected PGPR instead of chemical fertilizers for tea plants."

      "abstract": "Acute liver injury is an increasing global health problem. It is a widespread side effect of cisplatin treatment in the clinic and can lead to liver failure if not treated promptly. Previous studies have revealed that green tea can protect some organs from treatments. However, the potential of white tea to prevent the negative effects of acute liver injury has not been addressed so far. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reduction in cisplatin-induced liver injury in rats receiving white tea. Female Sprague Dawley rats with similar weight were selected in this study. Twenty-four rats were divided into three groups of eight animals each and ad libitum nutrition was provided. The control and cisplatin groups were given tap water only, while the white tea + cisplatin group received white tea at a 0.5% weight/volume concentration for four weeks. At the end of the fourth week, the white tea + cisplatin group and the cisplatin group received a single dose of cisplatin (7 mg/kg) via the intraperitoneal route. Five days after that procedure, the rats were anesthetized. Liver tissues and blood samples were collected, which were used for biochemical and histopathological analyses. According to biochemical results, liver tissue MDA and GSH, serum ALT, and AST levels significantly increased in the cisplatin group compared to the control group. Compared with the cisplatin group, although MDA, AST, ALT, and GSH levels were lower in the white tea + cisplatin group, only GSH levels were statistically different. The examination of histopathological and immunohistochemical findings revealed apoptotic cells, vascular congestion, and sinusoidal dilatation in the cisplatin group compared to the control group. This adverse event decreased in the white tea + cisplatin group compared to the cisplatin group. In conclusion, white tea exhibits an ameliorating effect on cisplatin-induced liver injury."

The substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer has been promoted to sustain crop yield and soil quality. However, knowledge gaps regarding the effects of organic substitution on soil quality and tea yield in tea plantations still exist. RESULTS: A field experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of organic substitution treatments (i.e. 25% partial substitution: biogas slurry + green manure + formula fertilizer, BFG; sheep manure + formula fertilizer, OFF; 100% complete substitution: sheep manure + green manure, OG) on the soil quality, tea yield and quality, and nitrogen utilization efficiency in southwestern China. Results showed that all organic substitution treatments slightly increased soil pH, and significantly increased soil organic matter by 13.22-14.88% compared to conventional fertilization (CF). The BFG treatment was the most effective in enhancing the soil quality index, showing increases of 16.80%, 8.37% and 24.87% higher than the CF, OFF and OG treatments, respectively. Tea yield significantly increased under the BFG, OFF and OG treatments by 11.97%, 13.58% and 5.90% compared to CF, respectively. The BFG treatment increased the amino acid content by 7.78% and decreased the tea polyphenol/amino acid ratio by 6.87%. Additionally, the BFG, OFF and OG treatments greatly increased the nitrogen utilization efficiency of young sprouts by 70.71%, 82.54% and 34.28%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, partial organic substitution could effectively improve soil quality while maintaining tea yield. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially to cancer- related deaths. Conventional treatment methods, including hormone therapy, chemotherapy, surgical interventions, and radiation, have long been utilized. However, these traditional treatments are often associated with serious side effects and drug resistance, limiting their efficacy. AIM: This review aims to explore the potential of medicinal plants used in breast cancer management in East Africa, focusing on their bioactive compounds and anticancer properties. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to examine the effectiveness of medicinal plants in treating breast cancer across Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda. Relevant studies published between 2003 and 2023 were identified using keywords related to breast cancer and medicinal plants. The search was performed across multiple databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Science Direct. RESULTS: Numerous natural compounds found in East African medicinal plants including Cymbopogon citratus (Lemongrass,) Tabebuia avellanedae, Prunus africana (African Cherry), Euclea divinorum, Berberis holstii, Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha, Curcuma longa (Turmeric), Garcinia mangostana (Mangosteen, Vitis vinifera (Grapevine), Eugenia jambolana (Java Plum), Moringa oleifera (Drumstick Tree), Camellia sinensis (Tea), Glycine max (Soybean), Catharanthus roseus, Madagascar Periwinkle), Rhus vulgaris (Wild Currant) exhibit significant anticancer properties. These compounds have demonstrated the ability to reduce breast cancer aggressiveness, inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and modulate cancer-related pathways. Current research focuses on these natural and dietary compounds to develop more effective strategies for treating breast cancer. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that East African medicinal plants hold promise as complementary treatments for breast cancer, offering potential benefits such as affordability, cultural appropriateness, and sustainability. Further research into these plants and their bioactive compounds could revolutionize breast cancer treatment, improving survival rates and addressing the rising incidence of breast cancer-related fatalities. Other: The review underscores the importance of continued research, conservation, and the integration of ancient healing methods to fully harness the potential of East African flora in breast cancer management.",

      "abstract": "Theaflavin 3,3'-digallate (TF3), a major polyphenolic component of black tea, exhibits antibacterial effects against many foodborne pathogens. However, the antibacterial mechanisms of TF3 against Listeria monocytogenes remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of TF3 on viability, biofilm, and membrane function of L. monocytogenes by the conventional plating method, crystal violet staining, and microscopy using fluorescent dyes JC-1 and Laurdan, respectively. It was found that TF3 showed excellent antibacterial activity against L. monocytogenes with the minimum inhibitory concentration of 62.5 mg/L. The viable count determined on TSA decreased by 3 log after the treatment for 2 h with TF3 at 62.5 mg/L. The viable count determined on TSA containing 4% NaCl decreased by more than 4 log after the treatment for 30 min with TF3 at the same concentration, suggesting that TF3 gave damage on the cells, enhancing the antibacterial action of 4% NaCl, but the damage was recoverable in the absence of 4% NaCl. To explore the antibacterial mechanisms of TF3, the effects of TF3 on membrane potential and membrane fluidity were investigated. TF3 reduced both membrane potential and fluidity of L. monocytogenes at 62.5 mg/L, suggesting that TF3 damaged the structural integrity of the cell membrane. TF3 reduced biofilm mass of mature biofilm of L. monocytogenes. Moreover, THEAFLAVIN TF40, a commercially available Camellia sinensis leaf extract containing TF3, reduced viable count of L. monocytogenes by 2 log on apple skin. These results suggest the potential of theaflavins as a natural anti-Listeria disinfectant.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the performance of a novel organic tea compost developed for the first time in the world from raw tea waste from tea processing factories and enriched with worms, beneficial microorganisms, and enzymes was tested in comparison to chemical fertilizers in tea plantations in Rize and Artvin provinces, where the most intensive tea cultivation is carried out in Turkey. In the field trials, the developed organic tea vermicompost was incorporated into the root zones of the plants in the tea plantations in amounts of 1000 (OVT1), 2000 (OVT2) and 4000 (OVT4) (kg ha-1). The experimental design included a control group without OVT applications and positive controls with chemical fertilizers (N: P: K 25:5:10, (CF) 1200 kg ha-1) commonly used by local growers. The evaluation included field trials over two years. The average yields obtained in two-year field trials in five different areas were: Control (6326), OVT1 (7082), OVT2 (7408), OVT4 (7910), and CF (8028) kg ha-1. Notably, there was no significant statistical difference in yields between the organic (at 4000 kg ha-1 ) and chemical fertilizers (at 1200 kg ha-1). The highest nutrient contents were obtained when CF and OVT4 were applied. According to the average values across all regions, the application of OVT4 increased the uptake of 63% N, 18% K, 75% P, 21% Mg, 19% Na, 29% Ca, 28% Zn, 11% Cu and 24% Mn compared to the control group. The application of chemical fertilizers increased the uptake of 75% N, 21% K, 75% P, 21% Mg, 28% Na, 27% Ca, 30% Zn, 18% Cu and 31% Mn compared to the control group. The organic fertilizer treatment had the lowest levels of antioxidants compared to the control groups and the chemical fertilizers. It was also found that the organic fertilizer increased the levels of amino acids, organic acids and chlorophyll in the tea plant. Its low antioxidant activity and proline content prepared them for or protected them from stress conditions. With these properties, the biotechnologically developed organic tea compost fertilizer has proven to be very promising for tea cultivation and organic plant production.",

However, there are limited treatment options available for repairing the damage to the intestinal barrier. As a natural plant-based health beverage, tea (Camellia sinensis) has been shown to have various potentially advantageous effects on the intestinal barrier and immune function. In this study, we extracted bioactive molecules from tea leaves, named exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs), and then examined their potential protective properties for the intestinal barrier. Through in vitro experimentation, we investigated whether tea-derived ELNs (TELNs) could offer a protective effect against lipopolysaccharides-induced damage to the intestinal barrier. In an in vivo experiment, rats were exposed to water avoidance stress and subsequently administered TELNs orally. The administration of TELNs resulted in the enhancement of the epithelial barrier in the intestine, effectively preventing bacterial translocation to the submucosae. Additionally, TELNs were found to improve the function of the intestinal immune barrier through the mediation of interleukin-22 and the increased secretion of antimicrobial peptide Reg3g. Notably, miR-44 and miR-54 in TELNs exhibited similar protective effects on the intestinal barrier. These findings suggest that TELNs possess the ability to restore the integrity of the intestinal barrier in the context of psychological stress."

      "abstract": "Tea plants are a perennial crop with significant economic value. Chlorophyll, a key factor in tea leaf color and photosynthetic efficiency, is affected by the photoperiod and usually exhibits diurnal and seasonal variations. In this study, high-throughput transcriptomic analysis was used to study the chlorophyll metabolism, under different photoperiods, of tea plants. We conducted a time-series sampling under a skeleton photoperiod (6L6D) and continuous light conditions (24 L), measuring the chlorophyll and carotenoid content at a photoperiod interval of 3 h (24 h). Transcriptome sequencing was performed at six time points across two light cycles, followed by bioinformatics analysis to identify and annotate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in chlorophyll metabolism. The results revealed distinct expression patterns of key genes in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. The expression levels of CHLE (magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase gene), CHLP (geranylgeranyl reductase gene), CLH (chlorophyllase gene), and POR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase gene), encoding enzymes in chlorophyll synthesis, were increased under continuous light conditions (24 L). At 6L6D, the expression levels of CHLP1.1, POR1.1, and POR1.2 showed an oscillating trend. The expression levels of CHLP1.2 and CLH1.1 showed the same trend, they both decreased under light treatment and increased under dark treatment. Our findings provide potential insights into the molecular basis of how photoperiods regulate chlorophyll metabolism in tea plants.",

Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) flower polysacchride (TFPS) is a novel functional compound known for its diverse beneficial effects in both vivo and vitro. To further investigate the effects of TFPS on MetS and gut microbiota, and the possible association between gut microbiota and their activities, this study was carried out on mice that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and given oral TFPS at a dose of 400 and 800 mg/kg·body weight (BW)/d, respectively. TFPS treatment significantly mitigated HFD-induced MetS, evidenced by reductions in body weight, fat accumulation, plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-1β, along with an increase in plasma IL-10 levels. Furthermore, TFPS induced alterations in the diversity and composition of HFD-induced gut microbiota. Specifically, TFPS influenced the relative abundance of 11 genera, including Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, which showed strong correlations with metabolic improvements and likely contributed to the amelioration of MetS. In conclusion, TFPS exhibits promising prebiotic properties in preventing MetS and regulating gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "Pesticides employed for controlling domestic and agricultural pests are among the most dangerous environmental contaminants. Nevertheless, negligent usage and a lack of technical expertise have led to the contamination and pollution of various ecological niches. The extensive utilization of the organophosphate chlorpyrifos (CPs) for insect infestation control, coupled with its detrimental effects and persistence in the ecosystem, has led to calls for its removal from contaminated sites. The study is mainly focused on degradation of CPs; using viz. Bacillus wiedmannii A3 and Bacillus cereus P14 isolated from tea rhizosphere soil having pesticide contamination in Sonitpur district, Assam, India. These two bacterial strains were able to degrade CPs in vitro within 3 days. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis suggested about 96% reduction of CPs concentration upon bacterial treatment. Again, in case of A3, GC-MS analysis revealed that CPs was modified to 2-hydroxy-3,5,6-trichloropyridine and chlorpyrifos-oxon, thus finally metabolized into non-toxic products. While analyzing P14, silane, dimethyl (2,2,2-trichloroethoxy) propoxy, and 3-aminobenzoic acid, N-trimethylsilyl-, trimethylsilyl ester were identified. These compounds were subsequently transformed into non-toxic products. In addition to this, they demonstrated a significant boost of plant growth-promoting traits in both absence and presence of CPs; also showed growth development in nursery scale condition. Moreover, they functioned as biocontrol agents against Phellinus lamaensis and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, responsible for brown root rot and anthracnose in North East India tea plantations, respectively. Thus, the pesticide-tolerant Bacilli strains A3 and P14 could be used as bioremediation of contaminated sites and also as biostimulants, and biocontrols in tea crop production.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Feline Herpesvirus type-1 (FHV-1) is a worldwide spread pathogen responsible for viral rhinotracheitis and conjunctivitis in cats that, in the most severe cases, can lead to death. Despite the availability of a variety of antiviral medications to treat this illness, mainly characterized by virostatic drugs that alter DNA replication, their use is often debated. Phytotherapeutic treatments are a little-explored field for FHV-1 infections and reactivations. In this scenario, natural compounds could provide several advantages, such as reduced side effects, less resistance and low toxicity. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential inhibitory effects of the green tea extract (GTE), consisting of 50% of polyphenols, on FHV-1 infection and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. RESULTS: Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cells were treated with different doses of GTE (10-400 µg/mL) during the viral adsorption and throughout the following 24 h. The MTT and TCID50 assays were performed to determine the cytotoxicity and the EC50 of the extract, determining the amounts of GTE used for the subsequent investigations. The western blot assay showed a drastic reduction in the expression of viral glycoproteins (i.e., gB and gI) after GTE treatment. GTE induced not only a suppression in viral proliferation but also in the phosphorylation of Akt protein, generally involved in viral entry. Moreover, the increase in cell proliferation observed in infected cells upon GTE addition was supported by enhanced expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic proteins. Finally, GTE antioxidant activity was evaluated by dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assays. The ROS burst observed during FHV-1 infection was mitigated after GTE treatment, leading to a reduction in the oxidative imbalance. CONCLUSIONS: Although further clinical trials are necessary, this study demonstrated that the GTE could potentially serve as natural inhibitor of FHV-1 proliferation, by reducing viral entry. Moreover, it is plausible that the extract could inhibit apoptosis by modulating the intrinsic pathway, thus affecting ROS production.",

      "abstract": "Consumer demand for functional foods has increased, helping to popularize and increase the consumption of Kombucha. Other substrates have been used together with tea to improve the functional and sensory properties of the beverage. Thus, this study evaluated the comprehensive biochemical, microbiological, and sensory characteristics of kombuchas fermented with green tea (Camellia sinensis) and different concentrations of yam (0, 10, and 20 % w/v). Based on pre-tests to detect the best concentration of yam in the beverage (10, 20, 30, and 40 %) and fermentation time (5, 7, and 14 days),the concentrations of 10 and 20 % of yam and five days of fermentation were selected through pH, °Brix, and sensory analysis. During the kombucha fermentation, there was a decrease in °Brix and pH. Sucrose, glucose, fructose, citric, and succinic acids were related to the beginning of fermentation, and lactic and acetic acids were more related to the end of fermentation in the treatment containing 20 % yam. The fermentation time did not change the color of the kombucha. Fatty acids, phenols, terpenoids, and alcohols were the volatile groups with the most compounds identified. Only two yeast genera were identified (Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Pichia membranifaciens), and bacteria of the genera Acetobacter, Lactobacillus, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Azospirillum, and Enterobacter. The beverage control showed less turbidity and more clear. The fruity descriptor was more perceived in treatments with yam. However, the perception of the apple descriptor decreases as the yam concentration increases. The yam's concentration alters the kombucha's microbiota and sensory characteristics, mainly appearance and acidity. Kombucha fermentation using yam extract is viable, and the product is sensorially accepted. However, technological improvements, such as yam flour, could be made mainly for appearance and taste attributes.",

      "abstract": "Cuttage is the main propagation method of tea plant cultivars in China. However, some tea softwood cuttings just form an expanded and loose callus at the base, without adventitious root (AR) formation during the propagation period. Meanwhile, exogenous auxin could promote the AR formation of tea plant cuttings, but the regulation mechanism has not yet explained clearly. We conducted this study to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of exogenous auxin-induced adventitious root (AR) formation of such cuttings. The transcriptional expression profile of non-rooting tea calluses in response to exogenous IBA and NAA was analyzed using ONT RNA Seq technology. In total, 56,178 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, and most of genes were significantly differentially expressed after 12 h of exogenous auxin treatment. Among these DEGs, we further identified 80 DEGs involved in the auxin induction pathway and AR formation. Specifically, 14 auxin respective genes (ARFs, GH3s, and AUX/IAAs), 3 auxin transporters (AUX22), 19 auxin synthesis- and homeostasis-related genes (cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and calmodulin-like protein (CML) genes), and 44 transcription factors (LOB domain-containing protein (LBDs), SCARECROW-LIKE (SCL), zinc finger protein, WRKY, MYB, and NAC) were identified from these DEGs. Moreover, we found most of these DEGs were highly up-regulated at some stage before AR formation, suggesting that they may play a potential role in the AR formation of tea plant cuttings. In summary, this study will provide a theoretical foundation to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanism of AR formation in tea cuttings induced by auxin during propagation time.",

      "abstract": "Since the last century, it has been shown that dedifferentiated cells of Camellia sinensis can produce catechins and other secondary metabolites under in vitro conditions, with potential applications in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries. In this work, cell suspension cultures of a C. sinensis cell line (LSC-5Y) were established in a liquid medium in order to optimize the biomass productivity, catechin monomer (GC, EGC, C, EC, CG, and ECG) and alkaloid (TB and CAF) productivity. The following factors were evaluated: concentration of growth regulators (BA and IBA), inoculum size, age of the cell line, light exposure, and effect of biotic elicitors (MeJA and extracts of Ciborinia camelliae). GC, EGC, and ECG increased approximately 1.80-fold when the auxin IBA concentration was increased from 0.1 to 2.0 mg/L. In addition, better productivity of EGC, C, EC, and CAF was achieved by using inoculum densities between 50 and 100 g/L. Although lower inoculum densities (25 g/L) showed a higher growth rate (0.20 d-1), the use of inoculum densities higher than 25 g/L favors a 2-4-fold increase in total catechin (TC) productivity, with maximum productivity being reached after 21 days of culture. However, the cell line showed instability in TC productivity: in the short term (in three successive subcultures), the coefficient of variation was 32.80%, and catechin production capacity was 2.5 years with maximum productivity at 0.5 years. Finally, it was observed that ethanol, used as an elicitor solvent, has a strong elicitor effect capable of increasing the accumulation of catechins up to 5.24 times compared to the treatment without an elicitor."

      "abstract": "The β-glucosidases known to improve tea aroma are all mesothermal enzymes, limiting their use under brewing conditions. Based on the properties analysis and molecular docking, the thermostable β-glucosidase (TPG) from Thermotoga petrophlia showed potential to enhance tea aroma. Treatment by recombinant TPG at 90 °C, the floral, sweet and grassy notes of instant Oolong tea were increased, while the roasted, caramel and woody notes were decreased. The improved floral, sweet and grassy notes were related to increase releasing of benzyl alcohol (floral), geraniol (floral), (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol (grassy), benzaldehyde (sweet) and 1-hexanol (grassy) by TPG hydrolyzing of (Z)-3-hexenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, hexanyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (HGP), benzyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, prunasin and geranyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (GGP), respectively. Although the catalytic efficiency of TGP to GGP was about twice that to HGP, HPG was more competitive than GGP when they mixed. Combined with microstructure analysis, the structure-function relationship of TPG-influencing tea aroma were understood. This study provided the method of how to mining new function of characterized β-glucosidases, as well as a theoretical basis for the development of new tea products.",

      "abstract": "Pickled tea is an anaerobically fermented tea common in Thailand, Myanmar and Yunnan minority areas. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is non-protein amino acid with multiple bioactives, which can be easily produced under anaerobic conditions. During the processing of pickled tea, controlling the process parameters is effective for the production of GABA-rich products; however, the precise parameters remain to be clarified. In the present study, the fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze (C. sinensis) 'FudingDabai', C. sinensis 'MabianLv No. 1', C. sinensis 'Wuniuzao' and C. sinensis 'Fuxuan No. 9' were used as raw materials to process GABA-rich pickled tea. Single-factor and orthogonal experiments were conducted to determine the best tea cultivars and optimize the best processing parameters via comparing the content of GABA, tea polyphenols (TPs) and other biochemical components of GABA-rich pickled tea. The results of the signal-factor experiment showed that the fresh leaves of C. sinensis 'MabianLv No. 1' had the highest GABA content of 2.61 mg·g-1 after treatment with vacuum for 6 h; therefore, C. sinensis 'MabianLv No. 1' was selected as the raw material for the subsequent experiments. Orthogonal experiments showed that the highest GABA content of 2.53 mg·g-1 was found in the pickled tea with 8 h of vacuum treatment, 20 min of rolling after microwave fixing, 20 min of spreading and 20 d of anaerobic fermentation at room temperature. Further, the sensory evaluation showed that it possesses a strong sour taste with a slight sweetness and a light yellow color and better comprehensive quality. This indicates that these parameters are optimal for the processing of GABA-rich pickled tea. This study will provide scientific basis for the subsequent production of high GABA tea."

      "abstract": "Light, as a critical environmental factor, plays a pivotal role in photosynthesis, ultimately influencing the timing of bud flush in tea plants. However, the synergistic effects of different photoperiods and light qualities on the timing of bud flush in the albino tea cultivar 'HuangKui' (later germination variety) remain unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different photoperiods (12L/12D, 14L/10D, 16L/8D, and 18L/6D, where L = the number of daylight hours and D = the number of hours of darkness) and ratios of red (R) to blue (B) light (R/B 1:1, R/B 1:2, R/B 1:3, and R/B 2:1) on the germination and growth of the albino tea variety 'HuangKui'. In our study, we examined how different photoperiods and red light and blue light affected tea germination and growth by investigating the timing of bud flush, photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, and growth indicators. First, our study showed that 'HuangKui' germinated 4 days, 2 days, and 1 day earlier under the 16L/8D photoperiod at the one bud and one leaf period compared with plants cultivated under the 12L/12D, 14L/10D, and 18L/6D photoperiods under light simulating the solar spectrum. Also, the growth of 'HuangKui' was maximumly promoted under the 16L/8D photoperiod treatment. Additionally, the earliest germination of 'HuangKui' was observed for the 16L/8D photoperiod under the R/B 2:1 (red/blue) treatment compared with the other treatments. Moreover, the greatest plant height, length of the new shoots, and new leaf areas were detected in the albino tea variety 'HuangKui' under R/B 2:1. Moreover, the contents of auxin (indole acetic acid, IAA) and trans-zeatin (tZ) under R/B 2:1 were significantly higher than those under the R/B 1:1 and control treatments with the 16L/8D photoperiod. Additionally, the auxin-related expression levels of CsIAA13, CsGH3.1, CsAUX1, and CsARF2 under the R/B 2:1 treatment were significantly higher than those in the control. The expression of CsARR-B, a positive regulator of cytokinin-related genes, was significantly higher under the R/B 2:1 treatment than under the control treatment, while the opposite result was found for the expression of the negative regulator CsARR-A. Therefore, the R/B 2:1 treatment with the 16L/8D photoperiod was an appropriate means of timing the bud flush for the albino tea variety 'HuangKui', which may be related to IAA or tZ signal transduction. In conclusion, our research offers a novel lighting strategy that promotes the germination and growth of albino tea cultivars."

The results showed that the N150 treatment significantly increased total polyphenols (TP), total catechins (TC), and caffeine contents, with the most significant increase observed in the content of six monomers of catechins (EGCG, ECG, EGC, GCG, GC, and EC) in the summer. The N300 treatment significantly increased TP and AA contents in the autumn while decreasing TC content. Additionally, the N300 treatment significantly increased caffeine and theanine contents in the autumn. Notably, the N300 treatment significantly increased both summer and autumn tea yields. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that TPs, AAs, TCs, EGC, and caffeine were key factors affecting the quality of Jin Xuan. Furthermore, the N150 treatment upregulated the expression of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) gene, which may increase the accumulation of catechins. In conclusion, it is recommended to apply 150 kg/ha of nitrogen fertilizer in the summer and 300 kg/ha of nitrogen fertilizer in the autumn. This recommendation provides a theoretical basis for improving the quality and yield of tea leaves in summer and autumn."

      "abstract": "Magnesium (Mg2+) is a crucial nutrient for the growth and development of Camellia sinensis and is closely related to the quality of tea. However, the underlying mechanisms responding to low-Mg 2+ stress in tea plants remain largely unknown. In this study, photosynthetic parameters, metabolomics, and transcriptomics were utilized to explore the potential effects of low Mg2+ on the growth and metabolism of C. sinensis. Low-Mg2+ treatment increased the ratio of shoot dry weight to root dry weight but decreased the photosynthesis of C. sinensis. Forty and thirty metabolites were impacted by Mg2+ shortage in C. sinensis shoots and roots, respectively. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses revealed the possible reasons for the decreased contents of chlorophyll and catechins and the increased theanine content in C. sinensis roots. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis indicated that the Mg2+ transport system was essential in the regulation of Mg2+ homeostasis in C. sinensis, in which CsMGT5 was identified to be the key regulator according to CsMGT5-overexpressing and complementary assays in Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, silencing of CsMGT5 in vivo reduced the content of chlorophyll in C. sinensis shoots. In addition, CsMGT5 might collaborate with ammonium transporters to keep the amino acid content steady, suggesting its potential application for tea quality improvement. All these findings demonstrate the key roles of CsMGTs for Mg2+ homeostasis in C. sinensis, providing a theoretical basis for Mg2+ efficient utilization in plants."

After P + C, PAC, NAC, and OM rose by 31.25%, 47.70%, and 10.06 g kg-1 compared to CK. In comparison to the CK, tea's hundred-bud weight (BW), free amino acids (AA), tea polyphenols (TPC), and chlorophyll (Chl) content of P + C treatment got 29.98%, 14.41%, 22.49%, and 28.85% increase compared to that of the CK, respectively. In the second year, the three treatments of P, C and P + C still had significant moderating effects on the physicochemical properties of the soil and the quality indexes of the tea leaves. The PAC of the soil under the three treatments increased by 0.06%, 0.07% and 0.18%, respectively, as compared to the control.P + C increased BW, AA, TPC and Chl of tea for 2 years. Three conditioners had 2-year regulatory impacts on soil fertility indicators, tea output, and quality. C and P + C both increased soil OM by 18.59% and 21.78% compared to CK in the third year, outperforming P treatment. Redundancy analysis revealed that the primary physicochemical factors influencing tea output and quality were soil OM and pH, with available phosphorus, urease, acid phosphatase, and available nitrogen following closely afterwards.",

In this study, potted tea plants were treated with three types of organic fertilizers (OFs), urea, and a control. The tea leaves were sampled over seven months from the top, middle, and base of the plants and analyzed for the δ15N and nitrogen content, along with the corresponding soil samples. The top tea leaves treated with the rapeseed cake OF had the highest δ15N values (up to 6.6‱), followed by the chicken manure, the cow manure, the control, and the urea fertilizer (6.5‱, 4.1‱, 2.2‱, and 0.6‱, respectively). The soil treated with cow manure had the highest δ15N values (6.0‱), followed by the chicken manure, rapeseed cake, control, and urea fertilizer (4.8‱, 4.0‱, 2.5‱, and 1.9‱, respectively). The tea leaves fertilized with rapeseed cake showed only slight δ15N value changes in autumn but increased significantly in early spring and then decreased in late spring, consistent with the delivery of a slow-release fertilizer. Meanwhile, the δ15N values of the top, middle, and basal leaves from the tea plants treated with the rapeseed cake treatment were consistently higher in early spring and lower in autumn and late spring, respectively. The urea and control samples had lower tea leaf δ15N values than the rapeseed cake-treated tea and showed a generalized decrease in the tea leaf δ15N values over time. The results clarify the temporal nitrogen patterns and isotope compositions of tea leaves treated with different fertilizer types and ensure that the δ15N tea leaf values can be used to authenticate the organic fertilizer methods across different harvest periods and leaf locations. The present results based on a pot experiment require further exploration in open agricultural soils in terms of the various potential fertilizer effects on the different variations of nitrogen isotope ratios in tea plants."

Identification of safe and cost-effective means to reduce risk factors is needed. Herbal teas may be a vehicle to deliver antioxidants and polyphenols for prevention of complications. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate and summarize the impact of herbal tea (non-Camellia sinensis) on glucose homeostasis and serum lipids in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). DATA SOURCES: PubMed, FSTA, Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception through February 2023 using relevant keyword proxy terms for diabetes, serum lipids, and \"non-Camellia sinensis\" or \"tea.\" DATA EXTRACTION: Data from 14 randomized controlled trials, totaling 551 participants, were included in the meta-analysis of glycemic and serum lipid profile end points. RESULTS: Meta-analysis suggested a significant association between drinking herbal tea (prepared with 2-20 g d-1 plant ingredients) and reduction in fasting blood glucose (FBG) (P = .0034) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; P = .045). In subgroup analysis based on studies using water or placebo as the control, significant reductions were found in serum total cholesterol (TC; P = .024), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; P = .037), and triglyceride (TG; P = .043) levels with a medium effect size. Meta-regression analysis suggested that study characteristics, including the ratio of male participants, trial duration, and region, were significant sources of FBG and HbA1c effect size heterogeneity; type of control intervention was a significant source of TC and LDL-C effect size heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Herbal tea consumption significantly affected glycemic profiles in individuals with T2D, lowering FBG levels and HbA1c. Significance was seen in improved lipid profiles (TC, TG, and LDL-C levels) through herbal tea treatments when water or placebo was the control. This suggests water or placebo may be a more suitable control when examining antidiabetic properties of beverages. Additional research is needed to corroborate these findings, given the limited number of studies.",

In this study, we analyzed the volatile organic compounds of fresh Jin Xuan (JX) tea leaves under different nitrogen application levels (N0, N150, N300, N450) during summer and autumn. A total of 49 volatile components were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Notably, (E)-2-hexenal, linalool, and geraniol were the main contributors to the aroma of fresh JX leaves. The no-nitrogen treatment (N0) presented the greatest quantity and variety of volatiles in both seasons. A greater difference in volatile compounds was observed between nitrogen treatments in summer vs. autumn. The N0 treatment had a greater total volatile concentration in summer, while the opposite was observed in the nitrogen application treatments (N150, N300, N450). Summer treatments appeared best suited to black tea production. The concentration of herbaceous aroma-type volatiles was higher in summer, while the concentration of floral volatiles was higher in autumn. Volatile concentrations were highest in the N0 and N450 treatments in autumn and appeared suitable for making black tea and oolong tea. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into how variations in N application rates across different harvesting seasons impact the aroma characteristics of tea leaves."

      "abstract": "The tea plant (Camellia sinensis [L.] O. Kussntze) is a global economic crop. Zinc treatment of tea plants can enhance catechin biosynthesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism behind catechin formation through zinc regulation remains unclear. This study identified a zinc-responsive protein, C. sinensis heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein 3 (CsHIPP3), from zinc-treated tea seedlings. CsHIPP3 expression was positively correlated with trihydroxylated catechin (TRIC) content. CsF3'5'H1 is a crucial regulator of the TRIC synthesis pathway. The interaction between CsHIPP3 and CsF3'5'H1 was assessed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, firefly luciferase complementation imaging, and pulldown experiments. CsHIPP3 knockdown using virus-induced gene silencing technology decreased the content of each component of TRICs. Compared with the control, the relative catechin content was reduced by 40.12-55.39%. Co-overexpression of CsHIPP3 and CsF3'5'H1 significantly elevated the TRIC content in tea leaves and calli. Moreover, the TRIC content in transient co-overexpression leaves was 1.44-fold higher than that of the control group, and tea callus was 50.83% higher in transient co-overexpression than in the wild type. Thus, zinc-regulated TRIC synthesis in a zinc-rich environment was mediated by binding CsHIPP3 with CsF3'5'H1 to promote TRIC synthesis and accumulation.",

Excessive daily ingestion of MSG leads to elevated amounts of glutamic acid in the bloodstream, which can be detrimental to brain structures. Camellia sinensis, often known as green tea (GT), is a rich source of essential hexogen antioxidants that are necessary for the body. Thirty-two adult male albino rats were divided into four groups (n = 8). Group 1 served as a control -ve group. Group 2 was given GT (1.5 ml/rat/day). Group 3 was given MSG (600 mg/kg/day). Group 4 was given MSG (600 mg/kg/day) and GT (1.5 ml/rat/day). All treatments were given orally for 28 days. MSG administration resulted in significant neurotoxicity in rats that was revealed by the significant reduction of serum concentration of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and nitric oxide (NO), and the significant elevation of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) accompanied by the significant reduction of levels of serum monoamines (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) and histological changes in the hippocampus area CA1, dentate gyrus, and cerebellar cortex and positive immunohistochemical staining of glial fibrillary acidic proteins (GFAP) and calretinin. Administration of GT with MSG counteracted the MSG-mediated oxidative stress by significantly increasing serum concentrations of GPX and NO and significantly decreasing concentrations of TAC. Furthermore, GT significantly increased levels of serum monoamines (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine). Moreover, it ameliorated the histological changes, GFAP, and calretinin immunostaining in brain tissues. It is envisaged that GT will serve as a viable protective choice for the inclusion of the neurotoxicity treatment procedure.",

      "abstract": "Flavonoids (especially anthocyanins and catechins) and amino acids represent a high abundance of health-promoting metabolites. Although we observed abscisic acid accumulation in purple leaves and low levels in albino tea leaves, the specific mechanism behind its impact on flavor compounds remains unclear. In this study, we treated tea leaves with exogenous abscisic acid and abscisic acid biosynthesis inhibitors (Flu), measured physiological indicators and conducted comprehensive transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying color change. Our results demonstrate that abscisic acid treatment induces purple coloration, while Flu treatment causes discoloration in tea leaves. Metabolomic analysis revealed higher levels of four anthocyanins and six catechins in the group treated with abscisic acid in comparison with the control group. Additionally, there was a notable increase in 15 amino acids in the Flu-treated group. Notably, the levels of flavonoids and amino acids showed an inverse relationship between the two treatments. Transcriptomic comparison between the treatments and the control group revealed upregulation of differentially expressed genes encoding dihydroflavonol reductase and uridine diphosphate-glycose flavonoid glycosyltransferase in the abscisic acid-treated group, leading to the accumulation of identified anthocyanins and catechins. In contrast, differentially expressed genes encoding nitrate reductase and nitrate transporter exhibited elevated expression in the group treated with Flu, consequently facilitating the accumulation of amino acids, specifically L-theanine and L-glutamine. Furthermore, our co-expression network analysis suggests that MYB and bHLH transcription factors may play crucial roles in regulating the expression of differentially expressed genes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and amino acids. This study provides insights for targeted genetic engineering to enhance the nutritional and market value of tea, together with the potential application of purple and albino tea leaves as functional beverages. It also offers guidance for future breeding programs and production.",

Green tea extract contains polyphenol, including flavanol, flavandiol, flavonoid, phenolic acid, amino acids and minerals which play a role in the repair of stretch marks through anti-inflammatory mechanism, increase collagen production, fibroblast proliferation, and skin hydration. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of green tea extract cream on striae distensae. METHODS: This is a pre-experimental clinical trial with a pretest-posttest design on 36 subjects with striae distensae. Diagnosis establishes through history taking and clinical evaluation. Imam Nelva Alviera (INA) score was used as SD severity before and after the application of the 3% green tea extract cream carried out at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Side effects and subjects' satisfaction were also recorded. Cochran test was carried out to see the difference before and after treatment, with a p-value <0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Majority of study subjects were 18-25 years (77.8%), had history of pregnancy (75%), had a history of menarche at the age of 12 years (27.8%) and all subjects had striae alba. There was significant decrement in INA score for striae distensae (p<0.001) after eight weeks administration of 3% green tea extract cream. Clinical improvement and no side effects were also noted. All subjects were satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: The use of 3% green tea extract cream can improve the appearance of SD.",

      "abstract": "Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is a highly selenium enrichment capacity plant; high selenium concentration contributes to the occurrence of oxidative stress and protein misfolding in tea plants, whereas flavonoids can chelate heavy metals to protect plants from oxidative stress caused by metal exposure. Nevertheless, the role of catechins in flavonoid synthesis and nutrient metabolism under selenium stress remains unidentified. Combining Word2vec and HNSW utilizing UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS-MS/MS to implement rapid matching annotation of the structural information on metabolites in Fu tea, we found that selenium-mediated changes in catechins in Fu tea were mainly associated with flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. The results demonstrated that selenium treatment increased benign selenol analogues (glutathioselenol) in tea and identified the novel selenopeptide PRSeMW (m/z 636.22571, Pro-Arg-SeMet-Trp) in selenium-enriched Fu tea samples to enhance the health benefits of tea. The selenium levels were negatively correlated with N5-ethyl-l-glutamine (11.63 to 4.26 mg kg-1) and (-)-epigallocatechin (13.26 to 11.19 mg kg-1), increasing the accumulation of tea polyphenols ((-)-catechin gallate, (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate, and (+)-gallocatechin), and decreasing the level of caffeine. These discoveries provide new insights into the mechanism of tea polyphenol-mediated transformation of selenium in Fu tea and theoretical support for the quality assessment of selenium-enriched tea."

      "abstract": "Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are known to have the effect of promoting plant growth. In this paper, three PGPR strains were selected from the previous work, which had plant growth-promoting activities such as phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation, phosphorus mobilization, etc. These strains named FJS-3(Burkholderia pyromania), FJS-7(Pseudomonas rhodesiae), and FJS-16(Pseudomonas baetica), respectively, were prepared into solid biological agents. Three widely planted commercial crops (tea plant, tobacco, and chili pepper) were selected for PGPR growth promotion verification. The results showed that the new shoots of tea seedlings under PGPR treatment were much more than the control. We also used tobacco, another important crop in Guizhou, to test the growth-promoting effect of individual bacteria, and the results showed that each of them could promote the growth of tobacco plants, and FJS-3(Burkholderia pyrrocinia) had the best effect. In addition, we carried out experiments on tobacco and pepper using multi-strain PGPR, the tobacco plants' height, fresh, and root weight increased by 30.15 %, 37.36 %, and 54.5 %, respectively, and the pepper plants' increased by 30.10 %, 56.38 % and 43.18 %, respectively, which both showed significantly better effects than that of a single strain. To further test the field performance, field trials were carried out in a mature Longjing43 tea plantation in Guizhou. There were four treatments: no fertilization (T1), combined application of PGPR biological agent and compound fertilizer (T2), only application of PGPR (T3), and only application of compound fertilizer (T4). In terms of yield, grouped with or without PGPR, there was a 15.38 % (T2:T4) and 92.31 % (T3:T1) increase between them, respectively. The tea's yield and tea flavor substances such as tea polyphenols, caffeine, and theanine were detected, and the T2 showed the most significant positive effect on both sides. Especially, an important indicator of Matcha green tea is the color, chlorophyll content was then tested, and PGPR application increased it and improved the appearance. All these results demonstrated that the PGPR we screened could significantly promote plant growth and quality improvement, and had good application potential in crop planting, which could contribute to environmental protection and economic growth."

      "abstract": "Modern science often overlooks to reveal the scientific essence of traditional crafts to promote their inheritance and development. In this work, five different types of tea products were prepared using the same variety of tea leaves referring to traditional methods. The analysis of their components and activities indicated that the processing reduced total catechin contents (from 172.8 mg/g to 48.2 mg/g) and promoted the synthesis of theaflavins (from 17.9 mg/g to 43.4 mg/g), reducing antioxidant and antimicrobial abilities of the resulting tea products. On this basis, the tea products were applied to \"tea flavored beef\" to reveal long-term effects. Within 15 days of storage, tea treatment showed remarkable antimicrobial and antioxidant activities on the beef. Also, the declines of sensory scores and texture of the treated beef were significantly suppressed. Meanwhile, protein degradation in the beef was inhibited, limiting the contents of various biogenic amines within relatively low levels.",

      "abstract": "Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) offer an eco-friendly alternative to agrochemicals for better plant growth and development. Here, we evaluated the plant growth promotion abilities of actinobacteria isolated from the tea (Camellia sinensis) rhizosphere of Darjeeling, India. 16 S rRNA gene ribotyping of 28 isolates demonstrated the presence of nine different culturable actinobacterial genera. Assessment of the in vitro PGP traits revealed that Micrococcus sp. AB420 exhibited the highest level of phosphate solubilization (i.e., 445 ± 2.1 µg/ml), whereas Kocuria sp. AB429 and Brachybacterium sp. AB440 showed the highest level of siderophore (25.8 ± 0.1%) and IAA production (101.4 ± 0.5 µg/ml), respectively. Biopriming of maize seeds with the individual actinobacterial isolate revealed statistically significant growth in the treated plants compared to controls. Among them, treatment with Paenarthrobacter sp. AB416 and Brachybacterium sp. AB439 exhibited the highest shoot and root length. Biopriming has also triggered significant enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative defense reactions in maize seedlings both locally and systematically, providing a critical insight into their possible role in the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) burden. To better understand the role of actinobacterial isolates in the modulation of plant defense, three selected actinobacterial isolates, AB426 (Brevibacterium sp.), AB427 (Streptomyces sp.), and AB440 (Brachybacterium sp.) were employed to evaluate the dynamics of induced systemic resistance (ISR) in maize. The expression profile of five key genes involved in SA and JA pathways revealed that bio-priming with actinobacteria (Brevibacterium sp. AB426 and Brachybacterium sp. AB440) preferably modulates the JA pathway rather than the SA pathway. The infection studies in bio-primed maize plants resulted in a delay in disease progression by the biotrophic pathogen Ustilago maydis in infected maize plants, suggesting the positive efficacy of bio-priming in aiding plants to cope with biotic stress. Conclusively, this study unravels the intrinsic mechanisms of PGPR-mediated ISR dynamics in bio-primed plants, offering a futuristic application of these microorganisms in the agricultural fields as an eco-friendly alternative.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that application of exogenous trehalose can enhance the heat resistance of plants. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which exogenous trehalose induces heat resistance in C. sinensis, a combination of physiological and transcriptome analyses was conducted. The findings revealed a significant increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) upon treatment with 5.0 mM trehalose at different time points. Moreover, the contents of proline (PRO), endogenous trehalose, and soluble sugar exhibited a significant increase, while malondialdehyde (MDA) content decreased following treatment with 5.0 mM trehalose under 24 h high-temperature stress (38 °C/29 °C, 12 h/12 h). RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in the MAPK pathway, plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and the galactose metabolism pathway. The capability to scavenge free radicals was enhanced, and the expression of a heat shock factor gene (HSFB2B) and two heat shock protein genes (HSP18.1 and HSP26.5) were upregulated in the tea plant. Consequently, it was concluded that exogenous trehalose contributes to alleviating heat stress in C. sinensis. Furthermore, it regulates the expression of genes involved in diverse pathways crucial for C. sinensis under heat-stress conditions. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the alleviation of heat stress in C. sinensis with trehalose."

      "abstract": "Renal tubular ectopic lipid deposition (ELD) plays a significant role in the development of chronic kidney disease, posing a great threat to human health. The present work aimed to explore the intervention effect and potential molecular mechanism of a purified tea polysaccharide (TPS3A) on renal tubular ELD. The results demonstrated that TPS3A effectively improved kidney function and slowed the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in high-fat-diet (HFD)-exposed ApoE-/- mice. Additionally, TPS3A notably suppressed lipogenesis and enhanced lipolysis, as shown by the downregulation of lipogenesis markers (SREBP-1 and FAS) and the upregulation of lipolysis markers (HSL and ATGL), thereby reducing renal tubular ELD in HFD-fed ApoE-/- mice and palmitic-acid-stimulated HK-2 cells. The AMPK-SIRT1-FoxO1 axis is a core signal pathway in regulating lipid deposition. Consistently, TPS3A significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated-AMPK, SIRT1, and deacetylation of Ac-FoxO1. However, these effects of TPS3A on lipogenesis and lipolysis were abolished by AMPK siRNA, SIRT1 siRNA, and FoxO1 inhibitor, resulting in exacerbated lipid deposition. Taken together, TPS3A shows promise in ameliorating renal tubular ELD by inhibiting lipogenesis and promoting lipolysis through the AMPK-SIRT1-FoxO1 signaling pathway.",

The present study investigated the protective effects of QDTP-Zn on ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. The UC mouse model was induced using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), followed by oral administration of QDTP-Zn (0.2 and 0.4 g kg-1 day-1). RESULTS: QDTP-Zn demonstrated alleviation of UC symptoms in mice, as evidenced by a decrease in disease activity index scores. QDTP-Zn also regulated colon tissue injury by upregulating ZO-1 and occludin protein expression, at the same time as downregulating tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6β levels. Furthermore, QDTP-Zn induced significant alterations in the abundance of bacteroidetes and firmicutes and notably increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. CONCLUSION: In summary, QDTP-Zn exhibits therapeutic potential in alleviating enteritis by fortifying the colonic mucosal barrier, mitigating inflammation and modulating intestinal microbiota and SCFAs levels. Thus, QDTP-Zn holds promise as a functional food for both the prevention and treatment of UC. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Moreover, the GXF performed better in enhancing aroma and quality of Longjing tea than the single functional enzymes and their mixtures. After treatment with GXF, the grassy and floral odors of tea infusion were significantly improved. Moreover, GXF treatment could improve concentrations of flavonoid aglycones of myricetin, kaempferol and quercetin by 68.1-, 81.42- and 77.39-fold, respectively. In addition, GXF could accelerate the release of reducing sugars, ferulic acid and xylo-oligosaccharides by 9.48-, 8.25- and 4.11-fold, respectively.
