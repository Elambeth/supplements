      "abstract": "Microbial antagonists are promising agents for controlling post-harvest diseases. Here, we examined the effectiveness and disease resistance mechanisms of the combined application of Cryptococcus laurentii and Bacillus tequilensis to combat postharvest blue mould in Bingtang oranges. The combined treatment effectively controlled the mycelial growth and conidial germination of Penicillium italicum in vitro, as well as significantly reducing the incidence of blue mould. This combined approach also enhanced extracellular chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase activities, resulting in increased cell membrane damage and leakage of cellular compounds. Additionally, the combined treatment altered the bacterial and fungal community structures on the fruit surface, thereby promoting the ecological balance of postharvest storage of the fruit. Furthermore, the application of the C. laurentii and B. tequilensis combination increased the activity of disease resistance-related enzymes (peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chitinase (CHI), and β-1,3-glucanase (GLU)) and led to the accumulation of total phenolics in Bingtang oranges. Thus, the combined application of C. laurentii and B. tequilensis effectively controlled postharvest green mould in Bingtang oranges."

      "abstract": "In recent times, nZVI composites have been developed as environmentally friendly adsorbents to tackle the issue of eutrophication in freshwater bodies. Herein, we synthesized nano zero valent iron loaded orange peel powder (nZVI@OPP) in different proportions (1:1, 1:3, 1:5, and 1:10) and investigated its PO43- elimination potential from water. Among them, nZVI@OPP (1:5) composite presented excellent PO43- removal performance (93.3%) comparable to that of 1:1 (100.0%) and 1:3 (98.9%), and therefore was selected for further analysis. The physicochemical properties of nZVI@OPP (1:5) also showed porous and irregular surface with more available sorption sites and reactive functional groups than planar and crystal surface of raw OPP, as revealed by SEM-EDX, XRD, FT-IR, and elemental mapping. The optimum conditions (nZVI@OPP (1:5) dosage: 2 g/L, contact time: 60 min, pH: 7, initial PO43- concentration: 10 mg/L, and temperature: 298 K) indicated 93.3% PO43- removal from simulated water samples. Based on higher R2 values, PSO kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models showed better fitting with PO43- sorption data. Moreover, various coexisting anions posed a negative impact on PO43- removal in the given order: NO3- < SO42 < Cl- < mixed anions, while no significant impact of thermal variations on PO43- removal was observed. The spent nZVI@OPP (1:5) also showed reasonable reusability potential when removing PO43- from aqueous solution. The dominant PO43- removal mechanisms including physisorption, chemisorption, ligand exchange, and complexation reactions were identified. In general, the current study provides new insights into the importance of selecting appropriate mixing proportion of nZVI and OPP, with the potential of extracting maximum PO43- content from water considering economic and waste management perspective.",

Thus, the development of a cost-effective, quick, and efficient adsorbent is highly essential for the Cr(VI) decontamination from wastewater. Herein, a microwave-assisted carbon-based composite called Mg-Fe LDH@OPAC was prepared by assembling Mg-Fe LDH onto orange peel-activated carbon (OAPC). Prior to investigating deeply into the adsorption behavior of the composite, the Mg-Fe LDH@OPAC formation was confirmed by using instrumental techniques like FESEM, EDS, Zeta potential, XRD, FTIR, Raman, XPS, and BET analyzer. The material had a high surface area of 143.9 m2/g and showed a good monolayer Langmuir uptake capacity of 118.36 mg/g. Under ideal circumstances, the maximum amount of Cr(VI) was removed within just 120 min and showed high efficiency in the presence of other coexisting anions respectively. The adsorption was accounted by pseudo-second-order kinetics and spontaneous in nature. Ultimately, a possible adsorption mechanism was suggested, confirmed by XPS studies; which showed that oxidation-reduction, electrostatic interaction, and surface complexation reaction were responsible for Cr(VI) adsorption on Mg-Fe LDH@OPAC surface.",

      "abstract": "This study explores for the first time the impact of chitosan (CS) with varying molecular weights (MW), orange peel extract concentration, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) content on the formulation of buccal tablets for treating oral infections. Utilizing a statistical design of experiments (DoE), nine different formulations were evaluated for mechanical properties, dissolution behavior, mucoadhesion, and biological activity. A formulation with high CS MW, 60% orange peel extract, and 8% HPMC, emerged as the optimal formulation, demonstrating superior tabletability, compressibility, and compactibility. Dissolution studies indicated that hesperidin release followed the Higuchi model, with higher extract content enhancing this phenomenon. Mucoadhesion improved with increased HPMC and CS concentrations, although higher extract content reduced bioadhesion. Biological assays showed that higher extract levels boosted antioxidant activity, while CS primarily contributed to anti-inflammatory effects. The optimized formulation exhibited broad antimicrobial activity against key oral pathogens, surpassing the effectiveness of the individual components. Principal component analysis (PCA) further confirmed the significant influence of extract content on tablet properties. These findings suggest that the optimized tablet formulation holds promise for effective buccal delivery in the treatment of oral infections, warranting further investigation in clinical settings."

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune illness affecting joint articulations, leading to a disability state. Currently, there is no satisfying optimal therapy except for immunosuppressants, which have variable and bad effects after long-term use. Hence, researchers have attempted to develop other alternative, safer, and more effective natural treatment agents that are effective and without undesirable effects. The objective of this research is to assess the antiarthritic properties of navel orange peel ethanolic extract (NOPEE) and naringin (NAR) in experimentally induced RA in male Wistar rats. RA was induced via two successive subcutaneous injections of 0.1 mL complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into a footpad of the right hind leg. The arthritic rats were orally treated with 100 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)/day of NOPEE or with 25 mg/kg b.w./day of NAR for 14 days. Results showed that treatment with NOPEE or NAR obviously counteracted the increased ankle joint circumference, inflammatory cell infiltration, pannus development, cartilage degradation, and synovial hyperplasia that developed in CFA-induced arthritic rats. Additionally, the elevation of serum rheumatoid factor (RF), prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) were significantly declined in parallel to enhanced level of serum interleukin-4 (IL-4). Furthermore, NOPEE and NAR supplementation, reversed the negative oxidative effects of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), as well as improved the antioxidant glutathione level (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. Overall, the anti-arthritic effects of NOPEE and NAR may be mediated through their modulatory effects on T helper (Th)1/Th2/Th17 cytokines, oxidative stress, and the antioxidant defense system."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Heat stress (HS) can negatively impact oocytes by disrupting mitochondrial activity, increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, and decreasing antioxidant levels. This study investigated the impact of orange peel (OP) exposure on zebrafish oocytes (ZOs) diameter, survival rate, and germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) during HS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated the antioxidant effect of flavonoids (concentration = 328.58 ppm) derived from OP (Citrus sinensis) added to in vitro maturation (IVM) media of ZOs (Danio rerio) under non-heat stress (NHS) and HS conditions to mimic in vivo HS conditions due to the global warming phenomenon on females. ZO in stage 3 (n = 1080) was treated with 4 μL of OP extract (not treated/control) under HS: 32°C (Heat stress 32°C solution/Heat stress 32°C orange peel [HS32S/HS32O]) and 34°C (Heat stress 34°C solution/Heat stress 34°C orange peel [HS34S/HS34O]); and NHS: 28°C (Non-heat stress solution/Non-heat stress orange peel [NHSS/NHSO]), during maturation. After 24 h of maturation, we observed the oocyte diameter, survival rate, and GVBD rate. The data were analyzed with IBM Statistics 23 software using two-way analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The highest oocyte diameter data were in NHS treated with OP extract (NHSO) group (0.759 ± 0.01; mean ± standard error) compared with HS group using and without OP extract (HS32S [0.583 ± 0.02]; HS32O [0.689 ± 0.02]; HS34S [0.554 ± 0.02]; and HS34O [0.604 ± 0.02]). The survival rate of OP treated group, namely, NHSO (93% ± 3%), HS32O (85% ± 2%), and HS34O (80% ± 2%) was higher than that of the group without treatment (NHSS [83% ± 3%], HS32S [71% ± 6%], and HS34S [63% ± 3%]). ZO treated with OP extract (NHSO [93% ± 3%], HS32O [85% ± 2%], and HS34O [80% ± 2%]) showed a higher GVBD rate than the group without treatment (NHSS [83% ± 3%], HS32S [71% ± 6%], and HS34S [63% ± 3%]). CONCLUSION: It revealed that OP can enhance the oocyte diameter, survival rate, and GVBD rate of ZO under NHS and HS. Further investigation should be conducted to determine the effect of OP extract (C. sinensis) on in vivo conditions in females as an alternative treatment to face global warming."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the hydrolysates from orange peel waste (OPW) as the low-cost carbon source for lycopene production. Initially, the dilute acid pretreatment combined with enzymatic hydrolysis of OPW resulted in a total sugar concentration of 62.18 g/L. Meanwhile, a four-month adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiment using a d-galacturonic acid minimal medium resulted in an improvement in the growth rate of our previously engineered Escherichia coli strain for lycopene production. After evolutionary adaptation, response surface methodology (RSM) was adapted to optimize the medium composition in fermentation. The results obtained from RSM analysis revealed that the 5.53 % carbon source of orange peel hydrolysate (OPH), 6.57 g/L nitrogen source, and 30 °C temperature boosted lycopene production in the final strain. Subsequently, the optimized treatment for lycopene fermentation was then conducted in a 5 L batch fermenter under the surveillance of a kinetic model that uses the Logistic equation for strain growth (μm = 0.441 h-1), and Luedeking-Piret equations for lycopene production (Pm = 1043 mgL-1) with growth rate constant (α = 0.1491). At last, lycopene biosynthesized from OPH was extracted and analyzed for qualitative validation. Likewise, its data on phytic acid (between 1.01 % and 0.86 %) and DPPH radical scavenging (between 38.06 % and 29.08 %) highlighted the better antioxidant capacity of lycopene. In conclusion, the OPH can be used as a fermentation feedstock which opens new possibilities of exploiting fruit crop residues for food and pharmaceutical applications."

      "abstract": "Obesity is a widespread prevailing health concern with multifactorial causes. Among the various defined molecular targets associated with obesity, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin play crucial roles in fundamental processes including energy balance, adipose tissue biology, and metabolic health, making them particularly significant in the study of obesity.Capsaicin and orange peel exhibit promising anti-obesity properties through their thermogenic, metabolic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Potential pathways for therapeutic approaches in the management of obesity are provided by these targets. The lipid-lowering and anti-obesity benefits of specific plant species have been highlighted in Asian medicine. Due to the potential anti-obesity qualities, capsaicin, which is derived from chilli peppers, and orange peel extract has been focused in this review. Capsaicin causes apoptosis in preadipocytes and adipocytes and suppresses adipogenesis. Citrus fruits are a significant source of bioactive substances, primarily flavonoids. Due to their ability to reduce adipocyte development and cellular lipid content, citrus polyphenols are helpful in the control of obesity. This extensive analysis offers insights into new treatment approaches for the prevention and management of obesity and metabolic syndrome by examining the interactions of molecular variables in obesity as well as the possible anti-obesity advantages of capsaicin and orange peel extract.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease - a prevalent food intolerance - requires strict adherence to a lifelong gluten-free (GF) diet as the only effective treatment. However, GF products often lack soluble fibre and have a high glycaemic index. Consequently, there is a pressing need in the food industry to develop GF products with improved nutritional profiles. In this context, the impact of incorporating orange peel flour (OPF) into muffins undergoing sourdough fermentation was examined, focusing on their technological, antioxidant, and nutritional characteristics. The functional properties of OPF were investigated using human colon carcinoma HCT8 cells as a model system. Treatment with OPF extract demonstrated a notable reduction in malignant cell viability and intracellular ROS levels, indicating potent antioxidant capabilities. Western blot analysis revealed significant alterations in key signalling pathways, including increased phosphorylation of NF-kB at serine 536 and reduced intracellular levels of caspase-3, alongside increased phosphorylation of RIPK3 and MLKL, suggesting potential involvement in necroptosis. OPF incorporation in muffins with sourdough increased antioxidant activity, reduced glycaemic index, and affected the volatile profile. Furthermore, based on simulated colonic fermentation, muffins with OPF showed a slight prebiotic effect, supported by the significant increase in bacillus-shaped lactic acid bacteria and Clostridia population. Overall, OPF-enriched muffins demonstrated considerable antioxidant effects and impacts on cell viability, underscoring their potential as functional ingredients in GF products. These findings signify the prospect of OPF enhancing the nutritional profiles and conferring health benefits of GF muffins.",

      "abstract": "In this research, cerium oxide nanoparticles were synthesized using orange peel extract via a hydrothermal method. An equal ratio of orange peel extract to cerium nitrate salt led to the formation of cerium hydroxide carbonate, whereas a 1 : 10 ratio formed cerium oxide. The hydrothermal treatment was conducted for durations of 5 and 25 hours. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that the hydrothermal samples treated for 5 hours exhibited significant agglomeration in both extract to salt ratios after heat treatment. X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed that all samples were converted into cerium oxide after heating at 500 °C for 3 hours. Based on XRD and SEM results, three cerium oxide samples, including those synthesized through the 25 hours hydrothermal process with a 1 : 10 ratio and the 25 hours hydrothermal process with both ratios and subsequent heat treatment, were selected for further investigation. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis revealed more adsorption of the functional groups of orange peel extract on the surface of the as-synthesized sample. Moreover, the heat-treated sample with a 1 : 10 ratio, initially cerium oxide, displayed a higher amount of surface functional groups than the one with a 1 : 1 ratio which was initially cerium hydroxide carbonate. The antibacterial activities of the samples were determined using the colony count method. Activities of all samples against Gram-negative bacteria are in the range of 91.5-93.2% with a negligible difference, whereas the as-synthesized sample exhibited a superior activity of 96.6 ± 1.8% against Gram-positive bacteria compared to the other two heat-treated samples. The 87.3% antioxidant activity of the as-synthesized sample significantly surpassed that of the other two samples, as evaluated by the DPPH radical scavenging method."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a particular type of breast cancer with the highest mortality rate. Essential oils are concerned more and more as potential anti-cancer drugs. METHODS: TNBC cells were treated with different concentrations of navel orange peel essential oil (NOPEO), and then a variety of  experiments were performed to investigate the changes in the growth and progression of TNBC cells. MTT assay was performed to detect the proliferation of TNBC cells. The changes of cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by FACS. In order to explored the migration of TNBC cells, scratch wound assay was carried out. Western blotting and qPCR were used to examine the expression of proteins and mRNA of related genes. Furthermore, RNA-seq was used to analyze the altered genes and explored the possible signal pathway. RESULTS: NOPEO demonstrated dose- and time-dependent suppression of TNBC cell growth. TNBC cells showed an increased percentage of G2/M-phase cells and the protein levels of CyclinB1 and CyclinD1 were decreased after NOPEO treatment. The apoptotic cells were increased in the NOPEO treated TNBC cells. The migration mobility was significantly inhibited by NOPEO. In total, 1376 genes were found to be up-regulated and 1335 genes were down-regulated after NOPEO treatment. According to KEGG and GO pathways, the differentially expressed genes were related to MAPK, Jak/stat and FoxQ signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: This investigation explored the bio-activity and molecular mechanisms of NOPEO against TNBC cells. These results indicated that NOPEO could suppress TNBC growth and migration perhaps via the MAPK and Jak/stat signaling pathways, which may provide theoretical reference for anticancer drug development. NOPEO may be a potential natural product for the chemotherapeutic of TNBC.",

      "abstract": "This study compares the inhibitory effects of orange peel polar fraction (OPP) and orange peel nonpolar fraction (OPNP) on trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) production in response to l-carnitine treatment in vivo and in vitro. Metabolomics is used to identify bioactive compounds. The research demonstrates that the OPP effectively regulates atherosclerosis-related markers, TMA and TMAO in plasma and urine, compared to the OPNP. Our investigation reveals that these inhibitory effects are independent of changes in gut microbiota composition. The effects are attributed to the modulation of cntA/B enzyme activity and FMO3 mRNA expression in vitro. Moreover, OPP exhibits stronger inhibitory effects on TMA production than OPNP, potentially due to its higher content of feruloylputrescine, which displays the highest inhibitory activity on the cntA/B enzyme and TMA production. These findings suggest that the OPP containing feruloylputrescine has the potential to alleviate cardiovascular diseases by modulating cntA/B and FMO3 enzymes without directly influencing gut microbiota composition.",

      "abstract": "Pectin, a kind of dietary fiber, has attracted much attention owing to its beneficial effect on human health in recent years. In this study, the effects of both 'Ganzhou' navel orange peel pectin (GOP) and modified GOP (MGOP) on type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were investigated. The results indicated that GOP and MGOP intervention had positive effects on T2DM in C57BL/6 mice. After modification, pectin can be changed into low methoxy pectin (LMP) and the content of GalA can increase, which endow MGOP with significant effects on improving lipid metabolism (TC, TG, and LDL-C decreased by 30.46%, 50%, and 37.56%, respectively, and HDL-C increased by 56%) and OGTT, further reducing insulin resistance (insulin decreased by 74.35%). In addition, MGOP was superior to GOP in improving oxidative stress (GSH and GSH-Px increased by 52.05% and 29.08% respectively, and MDA decreased by 84.02%), inhibiting inflammation and promoting SCFA synthesis. 16S rRNA analysis showed that MGOP changed the composition of intestinal microbiota in diabetic mice, decreased the abundance of Alistipes, Helicobacter and Oscillibacter, and increased the relative abundance of Dubosiella, Akkermansiaceae, and Atopobiaceae. The phenotypes of the gut microbiome also changed accordingly, which showed that MGOP significantly inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria and potential pathogenic bacteria and reversed the related complications. Taken together, our findings revealed that MGOP intake regulated lipid metabolism and oxidative stress and improved the gut health of mice, with promising effects against T2DM and related complications.",

When pre-treating the substrates with HPH, the release in orange peel was enhanced significantly leading to a POS content of 44.51 g/100 g peel, whereas oligosaccharide solubilization in apple bagasse was not affected. In vitro fermentation of the hydrolysates containing COS-2 and POS showed faster fermentation rates, between 6 and 10 h, and enhanced gas production, compared to those samples not subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. Short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production was not impacted by the presence of POS and COS-2 in the induced quantities.",

The experiment was conducted on 240 one-day-old Arbor Acres broiler chicks, assigned to eight dietary treatments with 30 broilers per treatment group. Four dietary orange peel meal (OPM) concentrations were supplemented, namely, the control (without OPM), and with 80, 160, and 240 g/kg of the diet. To each of these diets was added two concentrations of multi-enzyme inclusion (0 or 0.6 g as a combination of 0.5 g of Nutrikem and 0.1 g Optiphos per kg diet) in a completely randomized design in a 4 × 2 factorial arrangement. The experiment lasted until 42 days of age. Body weight gain (BWG) was influenced during the grower period (22-42 days) and the overall period (0-42 days), and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly improved by supplementations of OPM compared with the control for 22-42 days and overall (0-42 days) periods. Moreover, BWG, FCR during the grower and overall periods, and crude fiber digestibility were improved (p < 0.01) by multi-enzyme supplementation compared to the non-supplemented groups. Broilers with diets supplemented with OPM had considerably lower abdominal fat (p < 0.01) than the control. In addition, when compared to the non-supplemented enzyme group, serum T3 and T3/T4 ratios were significantly improved in response to enzyme addition. When compared to the control group, superoxide dismutase (SOD) was significantly higher in the OPM groups, showing the largest improvement in antioxidant response. Interaction effects were observed only for serum SOD levels. Based on our findings, it is recommended that OPM be used as a feed supplement for raising broilers, and adding 0.6 m g/kg of multi-enzymes could provide additional benefits to the performance of broilers."

Further analysis revealed that alkaline pH regulation facilitated solubilization, hydrolysis, and acidification while simultaneously inhibiting methanogenesis. Furthermore, the functional anaerobes, as well as the expressions of corresponding gene involved in SCFAs biosynthesis, were generally improved under alkaline pH regulation. Alkaline treatment might played a critical role in alleviating the toxicity of OPW, resulting in improving microbial metabolic activity. This work provided an effective strategy to recover biomass waste as high-value products, and insightful understanding of microbial traits during OPW/WAS co-fermentation.",

With a greater orange peel colloidal medium, the structure of the TiO2-NPs changed from a mixture of rutile and anatase phases to exclusively the anatase phase. The optical and morphological properties of as-prepared C-TiO2 QDs were characterized by HR-TEM, XRD, FT-IR, UV-visible, PL spectra, DLS, and Zeta potential techniques. The reaction condition was optimized by changing substrate composition, pH, and reaction time. C-TiO2 QDs exhibit outstanding stability at pH 7 and remain sustained for at least 180 days without aggregation. As prepared C-TiO2 QDs have distinct emission and excitation activities with an average particle size of 2.8 nm. Cell viability was performed on normal L929 cells, where it showed excellent biocompatibility (<90 %) even at the concentration of 200 μg/mL after 24 h treatment. Additionally, the synthesized C-TiO2 QDs were used with L929 cells as a fluorescent probe for bio-imaging applications. The results revealed that neither of the cell lines' morphologies had significantly changed, proving the biocompatibility of the synthetic C-TiO2 QDs.",

      "abstract": "The thin-wall heat pipe is an efficient heat transfer component that has been widely used in the field of heat dissipation of high-power electronic equipment in recent years. In this study, the orange peel morphology defect of thin-wall heat pipes after bending deformation was analyzed both for the macro-3D profile and for the micro-formation mechanism. The morphology and crystal orientations of the grains and annealing twins were carefully characterized utilizing optical metallography and the electron backscatter diffraction technique. The results show that after high-temperature sintering treatment, the matrix grains of the heat pipe are seriously coarsened and form a strong Goss texture, while certain annealing twins with the unique copper orientation are retained. The distribution of the Schmid factor value subjected to the uniaxial stress indicates that inhomogeneity in the intergranular deformation exists among the annealing twins and matrix grains. The annealing twin exhibits a \"hard-oriented\" component during the deformation; thus, it plays a role as a barrier and hinders the slipping of dislocation. As the strain accumulates, part of the annealing twins may protrude from the surface of the heat pipe, forming a large-scale fluctuation of the surface as the so-called \"orange peel\" morphology. The 3D profile shows the bulged twins mostly perpendicular to the drawing direction, about 200-300 in width and 10-20 μm in height."

      "abstract": "Orange peels are an abundant food waste stream that can be converted into useful products, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Limonene, however, is a key barrier to building a successful biopolymer synthesis from orange peels as it inhibits microbial growth. We designed a one-pot oxidation system that releases the sugars from orange peels while eliminating limonene through superoxide (O2• -) generated from potassium superoxide (KO2). The optimum conditions were found to be treatment with 0.05 M KO2 for 1 h, where 55% of the sugars present in orange peels were released and recovered. The orange peel sugars were then used, directly, as a carbon source for polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production by engineered Escherichia coli. Cell growth was improved in the presence of the orange peel liquor with 3 w/v% exhibiting 90-100% cell viability. The bacterial production of PHB using orange peel liquor led to 1.7-3.0 g/L cell dry weight and 136-393 mg (8-13 w/w%) ultra-high molecular weight PHB content (Mw of ~1900 kDa) during a 24 to 96 h fermentation period. The comprehensive thermal characterization of the isolated PHBs revealed polymeric properties similar to PHBs resulting from pure glucose or fructose. Our one-pot oxidation process for liberating sugars and eliminating inhibitory compounds is an efficient and easy method to release sugars from orange peels and eliminate limonene, or residual limonene post limonene extraction, and shows great promise for extracting sugars from other complex biomass materials."

In this work, an adsorbent hydrogel is prepared via free radical polymerization comprising acrylic acid (PAA) as a monomer and orange peel (OP) as a natural modifier rich in OH and COOH present in its cellulose and pectin content. The resulting hydrogels were optimized in terms of the content of OP and the number of cross-linkers and characterized morphologically using Scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, BET analysis was used to follow the variation in the porosity and in terms of the surface area of the modified hydrogel. The adsorption behavior was found to follow pseudo-second-order as a kinetic model, and Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm models. The combination of OP and PAA has sharply enhanced the adsorption percent of the hydrogel to reach 84% at the first 10 min of incubation with an adsorption capacity of more than 1.93 gm/gm. Due to its low value of pHPZc, the desorption of MB was efficiently performed at pH 2 using HCl, and the desorbed OP-PAA were found to be reusable up to ten times without a decrease in their efficiency. Accordingly, OP-PAA hydrogel represents a promising efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly adsorbent for MB as a model cationic dye that can be applied for the treatment of contaminated waters."

The present study aims to characterize orange peel extract (OPE) through in vitro and in silico studies. Furthermore, it examines the protective effect of OPE against experimentally-induced Alzheimer's disease in rats. The total phenolic and flavonoid content of OPE was 255.86 ± 1.77 and 52.06 ± 1.74 (mg/100 g), respectively. Gallic acid, the common polyphenol in OPE detected by HPLC was 3388.60 μg/100 g. OPE antioxidant IC50 was 67.90 ± 1.05, 60.48 ± 0.91, and 63.70 ± 0.30 by DPPH, ABTS and Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity methods, respectively. In vitro anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) IC50 was 0.87 ± 0.025 mg/mL for OPE and 2.45 ± 0.001 mg/mL for gallic acid. Molecular docking analysis for human AChE (4EY7) with donepezil, gallic acid, and acetylcholine showed binding energy ΔG values of -9.47, -3.72, and -5.69 Kcal/mol, respectively. Aluminum chloride injection (70 mg/Kg/day for 6 weeks) induced Alzheimer's-like disease in male rats. OPE (100 and 200 mg/kg/d) and gallic acid (50 mg/kg/d) were administered orally to experimental animals for 6 weeks in addition to aluminum chloride injection (as protective). OPE was found to protect against aluminum chloride-induced neuronal damage by decreasing both gene expression and activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and a decrease in amyloid beta (Aβ42) protein level, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), and nitric oxide (NO), and increased reduced glutathione (GSH) level and activity of the antioxidant enzymes in the brain tissues. Additionally, gene expressions for amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta secretase enzyme (BACE1) were downregulated, whereas those for presinilin-2 (PSEN2) and beta cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) were upregulated. Furthermore, the reverse of mitochondrial alternation and restored brain ultrastructure might underlie neuronal dysfunction in AD. In conclusion, our exploration of the neuroprotective effect of OPE in vivo reveals that OPE may be helpful in ameliorating brain oxidative stress, hence protecting from Alzheimer's disease progression."

      "abstract": "Heat stress in rabbits negatively affects their reproductive ability and milk yield. Aqueous orange peel extract (AOPE) is high in potential natural antioxidants that help avoid free radical damage and is a good source of phytochemicals. Based on these benefits, it was hypothesized that oral administration of AOPE could overcome the negative impacts of severe heat stress on reproductive and lactation performance, physiological parameters, and antioxidant status. To determine the protective effect of AOPE, 36 female rabbits (six-months-old, average body weight of 2.67 ± 0.03 kg) were given 1.50 mL water (control), and 2.50 or 5.00 mL AOPE every two days for four months. Oral AOPE administration significantly reduced the respiration rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) during pregnancy and lactation. The reproductive performance (litter size) and productive performance (litter weight and litter weight gain) were significantly increased by AOPE treatment, compared with the control. The highest milk yield was recorded in 5.00 mL AOPE treatment (5.00 mL). AOPE treatments significantly increased serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and AOPE treatment (5.00 mL) lowered serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) of heat-stressed rabbits. Serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was not affected by AOPE treatment. The addition of AOPE improved reproductive performance, physiological parameters, and antioxidant status, but did not have a beneficial effect on conception rate of female rabbits under severe heat stress.",

      "abstract": "Cancer-targeted drug delivery systems (DDS) based on carbon nanostructures have shown great promise in cancer therapy due to their ability to selectively recognize specific receptors overexpressed in cancer cells. In this paper, we have explored a green route to synthesize nanobiochar (NBC) endowed with graphene structure from the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of orange peels and evaluated the suitability of this nanomaterial as a nanoplatform for cancer therapy. In order to compare the cancer-targeting ability of different widely used targeting ligands (TL), we have conjugated NBC with biotin, riboflavin, folic acid and hyaluronic acid and have tested, in vitro, their biocompatibility and uptake ability towards a human alveolar cancer cell line (A549 cells). The nanosystems which showed the best biological performances-namely, the biotin- and riboflavin- conjugated systems-have been loaded with the poorly water-soluble drug DHF (5,5-dimethyl-6a-phenyl-3-(trimethylsilyl)-6,6a-dihydrofuro[3,2-b]furan-2(5H)-one) and tested for their anticancer activity. The in vitro biological tests demonstrated the ability of both systems to internalize the drug in A549 cells. In particular, the biotin-functionalized NBC caused cell death percentages to more than double with respect to the drug alone. The reported results also highlight the positive effect of the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups, present on the NBC surface, to improve the water dispersion stability of the DDS and thus make the approach of using this nanomaterial as nanocarrier for poorly water-soluble drugs effective."

      "abstract": "Orange peel waste (OPW) is known to contain an abundant amount of polyphenols compounds such as flavonoids, well-reported for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. While OPW is generally regarded as a food waste, the opportunity to extract bioactive compounds from these \"wastes\" arises due to their abundance, allowing the investigation of their potential effects on endothelial cells. Hence, this study aims to use a green extraction method and pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) to extract bioactive compounds from OPW. Liquid chromatography with UV detection (LC/UV) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) were subsequently used to identify the bioactive compounds present. Through the optimization of the extraction temperature for PHWE, our results demonstrated that extraction temperatures of 60 °C and 80 °C yield distinct bioactive compounds and resulted in better antioxidant capacity compared to other extraction temperatures or organic solvent extraction. Despite having similar antioxidant capacity, their effects on endothelial cells were distinct. Specifically, treatment of endothelial cells with 60 °C OPW extracts inhibited TNFα-induced vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in vitro, suggesting that OPW possess vasoprotective effects likely mediated by anti-inflammatory effects."

      "abstract": "Pollution by dyes and heavy metals is one of the main concerns at the environmental level due to their toxicity and inefficient elimination by traditional water treatment. Orange peel (OP) without any treatment was applied to effectively eliminate methylene blue (MB) and cadmium ions (Cd2+) in mono- and multicomponent systems. Although the single adsorption processes for MB and Cd2+ have been investigated, the effects and mechanisms of interactions among multicomponent systems are still unclear. Batch experiments showed that in monocomponent systems, the maximum adsorption capacities were 0.7824 mmol g-1 for MB and 0.2884 mmol g-1 for Cd2+, while in multicomponent systems (Cd2+ and MB), both contaminants competed for the adsorption sites on OP. Particularly, a synergic effect was observed since the adsorption capacity of Cd2+ increased compared to the monocomponent system. Results of desorption and adsorbent reuse confirmed that the adsorbent presents good regeneration performance. The low cost of this material and its capacity for the individual or simultaneous removal of Cd2+ and MB in aqueous solutions makes it a potential adsorbent for polluted water treatment processes.",

Compared with other drying methods, MD-treated peel contained the lowest total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC). The peel subjected to OD70 treatment was superior in TPC relative to other treatments and the highest TFC was found in the peels treated with FD. HPLC analysis identified thirteen flavonoids involving three flavanone glycosides (FGs) and ten polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) in navel orange peel and revealed that PMFs in peel were stable under all these drying methods, whereas the three major FGs (narirutin, hesperidin, and didymin) in peel significantly degraded in response to MD treatment. The peels subjected to OD50/OD70 treatments had the most potent antioxidant capacity when compared to other drying methods. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis was performed. The results revealed here allow us to recommend the use of OD50 or OD70 for the drying of orange peel, both of which help the maintenance of bioactive compounds in the peel and improve its antioxidant capacity."

Also, the OPW feeds reshaped the microbial community and enriched fermentative bacteria, especially those saccharolytic ones (i.e. Prevotella-7). The key genes involved in membrane transport (i.e. ptsG), glycolysis (i.e. pgk), pyruvate metabolism (i.e. ace), and fatty acid biosynthesis (i.e. accA), which are associated with VFAs biosynthesis, were up-regulated in OPW/SS reactors.

Herein, potassium oxalate (K2C2O4), an activating agent with less corrosive properties, was used for the synthesis of activated carbons from inexhaustibly available \"orange peel biowaste.\" For the first time, a comprehensive report is presented on the effect of hydrothermal treatment, hydrochar/K2C2O4 ratio, activation temperature, and melamine modification in tailoring the porosity and surface functionalization of activated carbons. The optimized sample, OPMK-900, exhibited large specific surface area ~2130 m2/g; micropore volume ~1.1166 cm3/g, and a high pyrrolic nitrogen content (~ 46.1 %). Notably, melamine played the dual role as a promoter to K2C2O4 porosity generation and a nitrogen dopant, which synergistically led to an efficient CO2 uptake of ~6.67 mmol/g at 273 K/ 1 bar via micropore-filling mechanism and Lewis acid-base interactions. Moreover, remarkably high IAST CO2/N2 selectivity (105 at 273 K and 96 at 298 K) surpasses most of the biomass-derived carbons. Furthermore, the moderately high isosteric heat of adsorption (∆Hads ~ 38.9 kJ/mol) revealed the physisorption mechanism of adsorption with a limited energy requirement for the regeneration of the spent adsorbents.",

Compared with the untreated orange peel, the SDF obtained with PEF exhibited stronger antioxidant activities, which was due to its smaller molecular weight (189 vs. 512 kDa). In addition, scanning electron micrograph images demonstrated that the surface of PEF-SDF was rough and collapsed. Overall, it was suggested that PEF treatment could improve the physicochemical properties of SDF from the orange peel and would be the potential extraction technology with high efficiency."

Anti-inflammatory drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are traditionally used to treat inflammation; however, these drugs often cause negative side effects. For this reason, developing and establishing effective alternative medicines for treating many chronic diseases with underlying inflammation is critically dependent on the identification of new organic molecules and bioactive substances. Aromatic and volatile compounds found in essential oils isolated from Pimenta dioica (allspice), Cuminum cyminum (cumin), and Citrus sinensis (sweet orange) are a source of bioactive compounds. Allspice essential oil reduces ear inflammation more than 65% and the anti-inflammatory activity of allspice essential oil is enhanced when combined with sweet orange peel and cumin essential oils, resulting in the reduction of edema inflammation by more than 85%, similar to indomethacin. As an alternative to anti-inflammatory treatment, essential oil mix is pharmacologically safe as it is neither toxic nor mutagenic."

Therefore, in the present work, with the aim of treating and reducing the pollution caused by heavy metal ions (Pb, Cd, Zn and Cu), activated carbons (ACs) were synthesized from sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and orange peel (OP) by means of physical - chemical activation method in an acid medium (H3PO4, 85 wt%) followed by an activation at high temperature (500 and 700 °C). Thereafter, these materials were used to produce carbon foams (CF) by the replica method and to evaluate their adsorbent capacity for the removal of heavy metals from synthetic water. XRD, FTIR, DLS, BET, Zeta Potential (ζ), SEM-EDS and AAS were used to investigate their structures, surface area, pore size, morphology, and adsorption capacity. The results show that as-prepared CF have a second level mesoporous structure and AC present a micro-mesoporous structure with a pore diameter between 3 and 4 nm. The experimental adsorption capacities of heavy metals showed that the CF from OP present a better elimination of heavy metals compared to the AC; exhibiting a removal capacity of 95.2 ± 3.96% (Pb) and 94.7 ± 4.88% (Cu) at pH = 5. The adsorption values showed that the optimal parameters to reach a high metal removal are pH values above 5. In the best of cases, the minimum remaining concentration of lead and copper were 2.4 and 2.6 mg L-1, respectively. The experimental data for carbon adsorbents are in accordance with the Langmuir and BET isotherms, with R2 = 0.99 and the maximum homogenous biosorption capacity for lead and copper was Qmax = 968.72 and 754.14 mg g-1, respectively. This study showed that agro-industrial wastes can be effectively retrieved to produce adsorbents materials for wastewater treatment applications.",

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the laxative effects of orange peel pectin extract (OPPE) against constipation induced by loperamide (LOP) in rats. Rats were equally divided into six groups and treated daily 1 week as follows: Control, LOP (3 mg/kg, body weight [b.w.], Per Os [p.o.]), LOP+yohimbine (2 mg/kg, b.w., i.p.), and LOP+OPPE (6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg/kg, b.w., p.o.). At the end of the experiment, the effects of OPPE were assessed by fecal parameters (numbers, weight, and water content), gastrointestinal transit, gastric emptying, serum metabolic parameter changes, intestinal and colon mucosa oxidative stress, and the histological examination. The defecation test showed that administration of LOP (3 mg/kg, b.w., p.o.) leads to the production of remarkable constipation. Indeed, the number and water content of stools decreased (25.50 [n/24 h] and 29.86%) significantly (P < .05). Acute pretreatment with OPPE significantly and dose dependently accelerated the stool moistening and allowed an increase of stool weight (2.85, 3.61, 3.93 [g/24 h/rat]) as well as the frequency of defecation (47.36, 54.54, and 56.26 [n/24 h]). OPPE also significantly (P < .05) and dose dependently increased the intestinal motility (70.78%, 73.33%, and 75.01%) and gastric emptying. LOP-induced reduction (P < .05) of intestinal secretion was accompanied by a colonic and small bowel oxidative stress status and histological changes, which was attenuated by OPPE treatment. The findings of this study indicate that OPPE possesses an important role in the gastrointestinal motility regulation, and thus lend pharmacological credence to the suggested use of the natural pectin for the treatment, management, and/or control of constipation.",

      "abstract": "The treatment of heavy metal (HM) wastewater is a critical and considerable challenge. Fruit peel-based HM adsorption is a promising way for the water pollution control and the reuse of agricultural waste. In this study, a novel adsorbent based on orange peel was synthesized for the first time by introducing abundant -COO groups with ethylenediaminetetraacetic dianhydride (EDTAD) to eliminate Cd(II) and Co(II) of sewage solution. The synthesized adsorbent displayed excellent adsorption capacity of 51.020 and 40.486 mg/g for Cd(II) and Co(II), respectively, and the adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 5 min, following the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order model. Surface characterization of adsorbents by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that ion exchange, complexation, and physical adsorption could occur during the adsorption process. The rapid and highly efficient adsorption performance suggests EDTAD-modified synthesized orange peel possesses great potential for HM removal from sewage systems.",

      "abstract": "In recent times, visible light enhancement has become much more considered due to the enlightening properties of nanocomposite systems. This has potential applications for wastewater treatment due to the blemish of toxic organic chemicals from industrial sectors. Therefore, this work is focused on novel 3D ZnO/SnO2 nanocomposites synthesized by the green method (orange peel extracts supported combined chemical processes) utilized for the removal of chlorophenol effluent. The orange peel extract has been incorporated as one of the major components to synthesize an effective nanocomposite. Also, the pure materials were synthesized along with these nanocomposites and tested under various instrumental techniques. The characterized results showed that the composites prepared with orange peel extract exhibited hexagonal 3D ZnO nanospheres with 3D tetragonal structured SnO2 nanocubes. Elemental analysis showed that the partial amount of SnO2 has transformed to SnO due to the reducing ability of orange peel extract. Also, the existing different (Zn2+, Sn4+, and Sn2+) states helped in delaying the transfer of electron-hole recombination to obtain photocatalytic chlorophenol degradation. Further, the prevailing line dislocation can compromise more vacancy and interact with more electrons. The high surface area, least crystallite size, and lower bandgap inspired to enhance the visible light activity. Simultaneously, the pure form of nanomaterial has poor light absorption under visible light. This study achieves the photocatalytic degradation of 77.5% against chlorophenol using a green 3D composite system.",

The purpose of the present intervention study was to investigate the effect of a spread cheese enriched with mountain tea (Sideritis sp.) and orange peel (Citrus sinensis) extract on postprandial metabolic biomarkers in healthy volunteers. In a cross-over design, 14 healthy subjects 20-30 years old were consumed either a meal rich in fat and carbohydrates (80 g white bread, 40 g butter and 30 g full fat spread cheese) or a meal with the spread cheese enriched with 6% mountain tea-orange peel extract. Differences in postprandial total plasma antioxidant capacity, resistance of plasma to oxidation, serum lipids, glucose and uric acid levels were evaluated at 0, 1.5 and 3 h after consumption. Plasma total antioxidant capacity was significantly increased 3 h after the consumption of the meal in the presence of the extract-enriched cheese, compared to the conventional cheese (p = 0.05). Plasma resistance to oxidation was increased at 30 min in the Functional meal compared with the Control meal. A tendency to decrease the postprandial rise in glucose and triglyceride levels, 1.5 h and 3 h, respectively, after the intake of the meal with the extract-enriched cheese was observed (p = 0.062). No significant changes in the concentrations of the remaining biomarkers studied were observed (p > 0.05). Further studies with a larger sample are needed in both healthy adults and patients with cardiovascular disease to draw safer conclusions about the postprandial effect of the extracts on metabolic biomarkers that predict cardiovascular risk.",

The MO degradation ratio up to 98.0% was obtained within 20 min in optimized conditions. The catalyst showed excellent catalytic stability exhibiting nearly 90% degradation ratio in the 10th cycle within 20 min, whereas pure Fe3O4-NPs showed only 62.5% in this stage. Due to the stabilization of complexing orange peel hydroxyl to iron oxide in the composite and its magnetic separation property, MOP composite exhibits excellent Fenton-like catalytic performance, which offers great prospects for low-cost and high-efficiency organic dye wastewater treatment.",

To alleviate disease-caused tree decline, maintain fruit productivity, and reduce disease transmission, enhanced foliar spray programs combining vector control and nutritional supplementation have been applied to healthy and diseased trees. The aim of this research was to discover if the various foliar sprays affect fruit peel oil chemical components. In this study, \"Valencia\" orange trees, with or without HLB (HLB±), were treated with the grower standard program (control, C) or one of four proprietary enhanced foliar spray programs (N1, N2, N3, and N4) over 16 months. Compared with HLB-, HLB+ samples had lower concentrations of typical peel oil components, including valencene, octanal, and decanal, and were abundant in oxidative/dehydrogenated terpenes, such as carvone and limonene oxide. However, limonene, the dominant component, was not affected by any treatment. Control and three out of four enhanced foliar spray programs, N2, N3, and N4, had very little influence on the chemical profiles of both HLB- and HLB+ samples, while N1 treatment greatly altered the chemical profile of HLB+ samples, resulting in peel oil similar to that of HLB- samples."

In this context, our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light at 254 nm on reducing bacterial spores of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Bacillus coagulans and Bacillus cereus at two stages of orange juice production. To simulate fruit disinfection before processing, the orange peel was artificially inoculated with each of the bacterial spores and submitted to UV-C light (97.8-100.1 W/m2) with treatment times between 3 s and 10 min. The obtained product, the orange juice, was also tested by exposing the artificially inoculated juice to UV-C light (100.9-107.9 W/m2) between 5 and 60 min. A three-minute treatment (18.0 kJ/m2) reduced spore numbers on orange peel around 2 log units, while more than 45 min (278.8 kJ/m2) were needed to achieve the same reduction in orange juice for all evaluated bacterial spores. As raw fruits are the main source of bacterial spores in fruit juices, reducing bacterial spores on fruit peels could help fruit juice processors to enhance the microbiological quality and safety of fruit juices."

      "abstract": "There is a growing interest in finding safe and natural anti-microbial compounds as a valid alternative to conventional chemical treatments for managing post-harvest fruit diseases. This study investigated the anti-fungal capacity of orange peel polyphenolic extract (OPE) against three relevant post-harvest fungal pathogens, Monilinia fructicola, Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria alternata. OPE extract at 1.5 g/L inhibited (100%) the mycelial growth and conidial germination of the three target fungi. At lower concentration, the effect varied, depending on the dose applied and target fungi. When the anti-fungal activity of the main phenolic compounds in sweet orange peel, namely, the flavonoids (naringin, hesperidin and neohesperidin) and phenolic acids (ferulic and p-coumaric), were evaluated, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid displayed significantly higher inhibitory capacity in synthetic medium, while the activity of flavonoids was limited. Synergism between compounds was not detected, and the inhibitory activity of OPE may be attributed to an additive effect of phenolic acids. Interestingly, in peach-based medium, ferulic acid remained active against M. fructicola and A. alternata and was more efficient than p-coumaric to control B. cinerea. These results highlight peel orange waste as an excellent source of anti-fungal compounds, suggesting the possibility of using ferulic acid or ferulic acid-rich extracts, either alone or in combination with other post-harvest treatment, as a natural alternative to reduce post-harvest losses and, also, enhance the shelf-life of fruit.",

      "abstract": "The aqueous extraction of orange peel waste (OPW), the byproduct of the juice extraction process generated annually in massive amounts (21 Mton), yields a carbohydrate-rich liquid fraction, termed orange peel extract (OPE). Several studies highlight that the combination of glycerol, a biodiesel byproduct, with carbohydrate mixtures might boost microbial lipid production. This study performed first a shaken flask screening of 15 oleaginous yeast strains based on their growth and lipid-producing abilities on OPE- and glycerol-based media. This screening enabled the selection of R. toruloides NRRL 1091 for the assessment of the process transfer in a stirred tank reactor (STR). This assessment relied, in particular, on either single- and double-stage feeding fed-batch (SSF-FB and DSF-FB, respectively) processes where OPE served as the primary medium and nitrogen-containing glycerol-OPE mixtures as the feeding one. The continuous supply mode at low dilution rates (0.02 and 0.01 h-1 for SSF-FB and DSF-FB, respectively) starting from the end of the exponential growth of the initial batch phase enabled the temporal extension of biomass and lipid production. The SSF-FB and DSF-FB processes attained high biomass and lipid volumetric productions (LVP) and ensured significant lipid accumulation on a dry cell basis (YL/X). The SSF-FB process led to LVP of 20.6 g L-1 after 104 h with volumetric productivity (r L) of 0.20 g L-1 h-1 and YL/X of 0.80; the DSF-FB process yielded LVP, r L and YL/X values equal to 15.92 g L-1, 0.11 g L-1 h-1 and 0.65, respectively. The fatty acid profiles of lipids from both fed-batch processes were not significantly different and resembled that of Jatropha oil, a vastly used feedstock for biodiesel production. These results suggest that OPE constitutes an excellent basis for the fed-batch production of R. toruloides lipids, and this process might afford a further option in OPW-based biorefinery."

AIM: We aimed to investigate the protective effects of Orange Peel Extract (OPE) and/or Selenium (Se) on chronic non-bacterial prostatitis in a rat model. METHODS: Fifty-six adult male Wistar albino rats were castrated; after 5 days, they were divided randomly into eight groups (n= 7). The control group received saline treatment; while 17β-estradiol (E2) (0.25mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously in rats from Groups V, VI, VII, and VIII to induce chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. They were then treated with OPE (400mg/kg body weight; Groups II, IV, VI, and VIII) and/or sodium selenite (0.5mg/kg body weight; Groups III, IV, VII, and VIII) for 30 days. Interleukin-2 (IL2) and Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 (PCA3) mRNA expressions were determined using qPCR; Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) protein expression was determined immunohistochemically. Prostate tissue histology was examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the levels of oxidative stress markers and antioxidant enzymes were measured. RESULTS: E2 administration significantly increased IL2 and PCA3 mRNA expressions, and PSA protein expression. It also increased the prostate wet weight and body weight, and lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, TNF-α, and IL-1β levels, decreased the glutathione and antioxidant enzyme levels and caused distinct histological alterations in the prostate gland. OPE and/or Se markedly improved all the studied parameters due to their antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory effects. CONCLUSION: OPE and Se showed protective effects against 17β-estradiol-induced chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. These results suggest that protection of chronic non-bacterial prostatitis by OPE+Se combination involves anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation. Moreover, their synergistic mechanism was mostly achieved via the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation processes.",

A two-step process was carry out to obtain activated carbons; the first step consisted of a simple physical activation at high temperature 400 °C to reach raw material decomposition; followed by acid activation at temperature of 500 °C. The effect of concentration of acid media (45, 65 and 85 wt.%) was analyzed in terms of the thermal stability, sorption, textural and structural properties. Surface area increases with the concentration of activation media, which is ranging from 114.08-355.52 m² g-1, 49.54-228.90 m² g-1 for sugarcane bagasse and orange peel, respectively. Fourier transform-infrared spectra showed the presence of functional C-O-P group, which confirmed with the thermal stability of the samples. The produced carbon foams showed a two-level cell structure with bubble and bar-like structures that increase the pore quantity in the carbon foams."

      "abstract": "Dyes are colored compounds which are visible even at trace concentrations. Due to their recalcitrance and esthetic persistence, certain methods are unable to effectively eliminate them. So far, adsorptive treatment using activated carbons (ACs) is one of the most successful methods. In this study, we have employed orange peel (OP) as a cost-effective alternative to the expensive coal- and coir-based precursors to synthesize ACs for cationic methylene blue (MB) and anionic methyl orange (MO) dye adsorption. The pre-carbonized OP was activated via H2SO4, NaOH, KOH, ZnCl2, and H3PO4 to study the effects of activation reagents on dye removal efficiencies and mechanisms. Among several isotherm models employed to fit the adsorption data, the Langmuir and Sips models sufficiently estimated the maximum equilibrium uptakes close to the experimental values of 1012.10 ± 29.13, 339.82 ± 6.98, and 382.15 ± 8.62 mg/g, for ZnCl2-AC (MO), ZnCl2-AC (MB), and KOH-AC (MB), respectively. The adsorption mechanisms were suggested to involve electrostatic binding, pi-pi interactions, hydrogen bonding, and electron donor-acceptor reactions. Consequently, more than 99% removal efficiency was achieved from a laboratory organic wastewater sample bearing ~ 35 mg/L of MB. The results thus suggest that the synthesized ACs from agricultural waste have the tendencies to be applied to real dye wastewater treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: chemotherapy drugs are the common therapy for cancer cells with side effects. Recent studies reported that natural products may contribute to decreasing the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of orange peel extract (OPE) and its main compound; naringin (NR) to protect the side effects of doxorubicin (Dox) in esophageal cancer stem cells (CSCs) derived tumors in vivo. METHODS: for this purpose, Esophageal cancer cell (YM1) derived spheres were treated in vitro with OPE, NR, Dox, Dox in combination with OPE or NR. The cell viability was assessed by XTT and the apoptosis was measured using Annexin/7-AAD and the cell cycle was also quantified by using PI staining method. The pluripotency related genes expression was carried out using qRT-PCR The protective effects of OPE and NR were evaluated by body weight evaluation and oxidative stress factors: malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) measurement in xenograft mice tumor model injected with Dox. RESULTS: ESCC CSCs overexpress SOX2 and OCT4 pluripotency genes. OPE or NR can protect the cellular toxicity of Dox in vitro mainly by decreasing cellular apoptosis of ESCC CSCs however S-phase cell cycle arrest has not been affected significantly. In vivo experiments revealed that the use of Dox simultaneously with OPE or NR not only can reduce the tumor size but also the body weight of the treated nude mice were maintained in comparison to Dox alone. In contrast to Dox alone, Dox in combination with OPE or NR showed less systemic toxicity and decreased oxidative stress fraction circulation, however, OPE seemed as more protective. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that these natural compounds can be used as adjuvant therapy to lower systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents like DOX in ESCC cancer stem cells treatment.",

The safe and stable expression of cellulase gene sestc was achieved by applying the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 approach to the integration of sestc expression cassette containing Agaricus biporus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase gene (gpd) promoter in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome. The target insertion site was found to be located in the S. cerevisiae hexokinase 2 by designing a gRNA expression vector. The recombinant SESTC protein exhibited a size of approximately 44 kDa in the engineered S. cerevisiae. By using orange peel as the fermentation substrate, the filter paper, endo-1,4-β-glucanase, exo-1,4-β-glucanase activities of the transformants were 1.06, 337.42, and 1.36 U/mL, which were 35.3-fold, 23.03-fold, and 17-fold higher than those from wild-type S. cerevisiae, respectively. After 6 h treatment, approximately 20 g/L glucose was obtained. Under anaerobic conditions the highest ethanol concentration reached 7.53 g/L after 48 h fermentation and was 37.7-fold higher than that of wild-type S. cerevisiae (0.2 g/L). The engineered strains may provide a valuable material for the development of lignocellulosic ethanol."

Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were used as the control variables of feedstocks composition in this work. After hydrothermal process, lignin added feedstock produced more hydrochar, which contained rougher surface with nearly doubled BET areas and more benzene rings. Hemicellulose-aided hydrochar possessed higher density of carbonaceous microspheres and richer hydroxyl. This char was simultaneously covered by more esters or lactones with more aromatic oxygen-containing groups inside. Similar to hemicellulose, cellulose improved the formation of diverse oxygenous groups but reduced the size of microspheres on hydrochar.",

Effects of pH, adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dosage, and temperature for the removal of Cu (II) were studied. Slightly acidic environment (pH = 6) was found to be optimum for removal of copper. The equilibrium data were well fitted with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The surface morphology of the adsorbent was studied using scanning electron microscope. Crystalline nonhomogenous surface was observed after copper adsorption.

      "abstract": "Increasing exposure to arsenic (As) contaminated ground water has become a global health hazard to humanity. Suitable adsorbent for As removal from water, especially for As(III) than As(V), is an urgent but still a challenging task. In this study, waste orange peel (OP) was modified with magnetic nanoparticles followed by calcination as a novel adsorbent and investigated for instantaneous oxidation and adsorption of As(III) from aqueous solutions. The batch adsorption experimental results showed that calcined magnetic orange peel composites (CMOPC) exhibited superior As(III) adsorption capacity (10.3mg/g) as compared to similar cost effective adsorbents due to its high surface area, large pore size and greater numbers of active sites on its surface. The adsorption equilibrium data obeyed Langmuir model, and kinetic data was well described by the pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption mechanisms for As(III) might be involved ligand exchange of the hydroxyl in CMOPC to form Fe-O-As(III), and partial As(III) oxidation to As(V) followed by instantaneous adsorption on surface of CMOPC. The developed adsorbent has also demonstrated good anti-interference ability to co-existing ions, admirable regeneration ability and pronounced capacity in treating simulated real As(III) contaminated water. This study revealed that waste orange peel, after simple treatment could be used as a potential adsorbent for As(III) from aqueous solutions.",

      "abstract": "The therapy of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) stays a challenging issue. During the last decade, there has been an interest in the expansion of anti-diabetic drugs especially those of natural sources. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the anti-hyperglycemic and the anti-hyperlipidemic effects as well as the anti-oxidant activities of navel orange hydroethanolic extract and its constituting flavonoids naringin and naringenin on nicotineamide (NA)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic rats. To induce T2DM, 16h-fasted rats were intraperitoneally injected with STZ at dose of 50mg/kg body weight (b. w.), 15min after the intraperitoneal administration of NA (120mg/kg b. w.). The NA/STZ-induced type 2 diabetic rats were orally treated with navel orange peel hydroethanolic extract, naringin and narengenin at dose level of 100mg/kg b. w./day for 4 weeks. The treatments with navel orange peel hydroethanolic extract, naringin and narengenin potentially alleviated the lowered serum insulin and C-peptide levels, the depleted liver glycogen content, the elevated liver glucose-6-phosphatase and glycogen phosphorylase activities, the deteriorated serum lipid profile, and the suppressed liver antioxidant defense system of NA/STZ-induced type 2 diabetic rats. The treatments also enhanced the mRNA expression of insulin receptor β-subunit, GLUT4 and adiponectin in adipose tissue of STZ/NA-induced type 2 diabetic rats. In conclusion, the navel orange peel hydroethanolic extract, naringin and naringenin have potent anti-diabetic effects in NA/STZ-induced type 2 diabetic rats via their insulinotropic effects and insulin improving action which in turn may be mediated through enhancing insulin receptor, GLUT4 and adiponectin expression in adipose tissue.",

      "abstract": "Dry citrus peels, also known as \"chenpi\", have been traditionally used to treat and relieve intestinal inflammation. Recently we have reported that orange peel extracts (OPE) which contain relatively greater polymethoxylated flavone (PMF) content exhibit superior antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro. Moreover, these bioactivities were notably greater than an equivalent flavonoid mixture (FM). The present study compares the effects of different OPE sources with distinct PMF composition on tight junction (TJ) dysfunction induced by ethanol. The OPE obtained from Xinhui, China, contained a 20-fold higher PMF content than extracts derived from the orange peels sourced from Guangxi. Xinhui-OPE treatment of ethanol treated Caco-2 cells corresponded to lower (P < 0.05) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and higher (P < 0.05) glutathione reductase activity. Both OPE and the FM prevented ethanol-induced increases in Caco-2 cell paracellular permeability and the dislocation of TJ proteins, including claudin 4, occludin, and zonulin occludin-1 (ZO-1), respectively. Xinhui-OPE increased the expression of claudin 4 and occludin protein, but not mRNA, whereas, Guangxi-OPE and Xinhui-FM had no effect on TJ protein expression. In conclusion, OPE derived from sources that contain higher concentrations of PMF are more effective at preventing intestinal barrier dysfunction of TJ proteins induced by ethanol.",

Treatment followed by extraction into organic solvents resulted in 8-9 fold increase in extraction of carotenoidic pigments compared to use of free enzymes. Optimum pH and temperature for the process were determined to be 5.0 and 50 °C, respectively. The nanobiocatalysts could be reused across three cycles with only 15 % drop in yield per cycle.

In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanism of action of 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone (5-OH-HxMF), one of major HPMFs in orange peel. Treatment of 5-OH-HxMF effectively inhibited lipid accumulation by 55-60% in a dose-dependent manner. The 5-OH-HxMF attenuated adipogenesis through downregulating adipogenesis-related transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), as well as downstream target fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). 5-OH-HxMF activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling and silent mating type information regulation 1 (SIRTUIN 1 or SIRT1) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes to decrease lipid accumulation. In addition, the inhibition rate of lipid accumulation was compared between 5-OH-HxMF and 3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone (HpMF). 5-OH-HxMF inhibited lipid accumulation 15-20% more than HpMF did, indicating that hydroxyl group at position 5 can be a key factor in the suppression of adipogenesis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gynecomastia is a common aesthetic problem faced by men with reported incidence as high as 65% with serious psychosocial impact. Although various techniques of liposculpture combined with glandular excision is the standard of treatment, many of the glandular excision techniques have inherent limitations and complications such as leaving a long scar, long operative time, contour abnormalities, and increased risk of hematoma. Here, we describe an innovative \"the orange peel excision of gland (OPEG) technique\" which overcomes these limitations with excellent cosmetic results. METHODS: A total of 38 breasts were operated in 20 patients (18 bilateral and 2 unilateral). All the patients underwent suction-assisted liposuction and glandular excision under general anesthesia by our OPEG technique. RESULTS: The average operative time per breast was 60 minutes. One patient had a small hematoma which did not require evacuation. The patient satisfaction rate was 95%. CONCLUSION: The technique has reduced operative time and avoids residual gland and hematoma with excellent aesthetic outcome.",

      "abstract": "Microorganisms have the potential to become a game-changer in sustainable energy production in the coming generations. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) as an alternative renewable technology can capture bioenergy (electricity) from carbon-based sources by utilizing microorganisms as biocatalysts. This study demonstrated that MFC technology can be explored for bioelectricity production from orange peel waste (OPW), an agricultural byproduct and an organic substrate, without any chemical pretreatment or the addition of extra mediators. A maximum voltage generation of 0.59 ± 0.02 V (at 500 Ω) was achieved in a dual chamber MFC during stable voltage generation stages. The maximum power density and current density obtained were 358.8 ± 15.6 mW/m(2) and 847 ± 18.4 mA/m(2), respectively. Key components of OPW, namely pectin and cellulose, were also tested in their pure form, with pectin giving a stable current, while no significant current generation was achieved using cellulose alone as the substrate, thus demonstrating the absence of cellulose-degrading bacteria. Maximum pectinase and polygalacturonase enzyme activities of 18.55 U/g and 9.04 U/g (per gram of substrate), respectively were achieved during orange peel degradation in MFCs. Bacterial identification using 16S rRNA analysis of the initial inoculum fed to the MFC, the biofilm attached to the anode, and the anode suspension, showed significant diversity in community composition. A well-known exoelectrogen, Pseudomonas, was present among the predominant genera in the anode biofilm.",

Peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), radical scavenging activity (RSA) and free fatty acids (FFA) of ghee samples were analyzed during the study. PV, TBA and FFA of ghee samples increased significantly while radical scavenging activity (RSA) of ghee samples decreased significantly at accelerated temperature (T3) as compared to the temperatures at T1 and T2. Effect of storage temperature on development of peroxides and TBA of ghee samples was significantly higher than the effect of treatment and storage period while treatment had more significant effect on the change in FFA and RSA as compared to storage temperature and storage period. Ghee incorporated with orange peel extract (OPE) showed stronger activity in quenching DPPH radicals and least development of PV, TBA and FFA than ghee incorporated with BHA and control. The study revealed that orange peel could be a good natural source of antioxidants which can be used in fat rich food products like ghee to retard oxidative deterioration."

The results showed that when OPP was pretreated only by microwave (630 W, 9 min, and liquid/solid ratio 5), the activities of exo-pectinase, carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase), xylanase, and filter paper cellulase (FPase) were increased by 11.8, 20.6, 16.2, and 24.0 %, respectively, and when OPP was pretreated by microwave at the same conditions cited above plus PEG 4000 at the concentration of 3 g/L, the activities of the above four enzymes were enhanced by 40.2, 30.3, 40.4, and 40.0 % after 84-h cultivation, respectively. It is suggested a synergistic effect between microwave and surfactant treatment in enhancing the multiextracellular enzymes production by OPP fermentation of A. japonicus PJ01. Chemical composition and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis displayed that the microwave pretreatment of OPP led to the decrease of hemicellulose and essential oil contents. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that OPP surface after microwave pretreatment became porous and more susceptible to be invaded by A. japonicus. The results demonstrated that pretreatment of OPP by surfactant PEG 4000 and microwave irradiation as environment-friendly way was cost-effective in enhancing the multienzyme production from agricultural waste orange peel.",

The prebiotic potential of the concentrate was assessed by in vitro fermentation using human fecal inocula. For comparative purposes, similar experiments were performed using orange pectin and commercial fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) as substrates for fermentation. The dynamics of selected microbial populations was assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Gas generation, pH, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production were also measured. Under the tested conditions, all of the considered substrates were utilized by the microbiota, and fermentation resulted in increased numbers of all the bacterial groups, but the final profile of the microbial population depended on the considered carbon source. POS boosted particularly the numbers of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, so that the ratio between the joint counts of both genera and the total cell number increased from 17% in the inocula to 27% upon fermentation. SCFA generation from POS fermentation was similar to that observed with FOS, but pectin fermentation resulted in reduced butyrate generation.",

Three treatments (boiling, alkaline, and pectinase) were investigated with and without subsequent grinding treatment. It was possible to prepare the cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) using these methods, except for the boiling treatment with grinding. Interestingly, only pectinase and a mild-physical blender treatment without grinding produced nanofibers. The width of the nanofibers from OP was approximately 10 to 50 nm. The microfibril bundles of OP were considered to be thinner than those of commercial CNFs. Our data indicated that the removal of pectic polysaccharides and hemicelluloses covering the cellulose microfibrils was important for the preparation of nanofibers from OP. These nanofibers from OP using pectinase are proposed to be applicable as food materials, pharmaceuticals, and filters for the tractive characteristics of the sheet. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study demonstrates: (1) it was possible to prepare the nanofibers from orange peel using pectinase and (2) the width of the nanofibers from orange peel was approximately 10 to 50 nm. (3) Removal of polysaccharides such as pectin and hemicelluloses covering cellulose microfibrils was very important for preparation of nanofibers from OP. Considering the tractive characteristics of the sheets from nanofibers and the origin of orange peel, they are suitable for application of food materials, pharmaceuticals, and filters.",

Characterization by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller indicates that the adsorbents are mesoporous, with pHzpc values of 5.0 for HP and 4.0 for OP. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy identified carbonyl and sulphonic groups. The initial pH of the best-adsorbing solution of the three colours was 2.0. Increasing the concentration of the adsorbent promoted an increase in the percentage of removal until saturation of the adsorbent. In a factorial design, the largest value of q was obtained with 0.25 g of the adsorbent, with a particle size of < 0.4 mm and a stirring speed of 300 rpm. Such conditions were used in kinetic studies and studies of adsorption equilibrium. The evolution kinetics were rapid in the first few minutes, and after 180 min the system reached equilibrium. The kinetic model that best fit the experimental data to a 95% confidence level for the F test was the pseudo-second-order model for RYG/HP, RG/OP and RT/OP. There was no significant difference between the kinetic models as evaluated by the F test for RYG/OP, RG/HP and RT/HP. The experimental results indicated favourable dye adsorption characteristics for the adsorbents studied. The results of the F test showed that for RYG and RG, there was no significant difference between the two evaluated models. This study suggests that HP and OP are viable alternatives for the treatment of effluents containing RYG, RG and RT dyes.",

Hesperetin, rutin and hesperidin from orange peel, and catechin from green tea leaves, were isolated and their chemical structures were analyzed. All four compounds were evaluated for their trypsin inhibitory potential. RESULTS: Among all the isolated compounds, rutin exhibited the highest protease inhibition activity (75.4 ± 0.9%) with IC50 = 16 ± 2 µmol L(-1), followed by catechin (65.3 ± 1.4%; IC50 = 83 ± 9 µmol L(-1)), hesperetin (62.1 ± 1.3%; IC50 = 104 ± 12 µmol L(-1)) and hesperidin (59.7 ± 1.1%; IC50 = 127 ± 14 µmol L(-1)). Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots and their secondary replots indicated that all four compounds possessed non-competitive inhibition. The Ki values of hesperetin, rutin, hesperidin and catechin were calculated as 90.2 ± 1.1, 17.5 ± 0.6, 84.2 ± 1.5 and 65.1 ± 1.5 µmol L(-1) respectively.

Fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 was measured daily for 5 days after inoculation, after which all animals were humanely euthanized. At 96 h postinoculation, E. coli O157:H7 shedding was reduced (P < 0.05) in sheep fed 10% OP. Populations of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 were reduced by OP treatment throughout the gastrointestinal tract; however, this reduction reached significant levels in the rumen (P < 0.05) of sheep fed 10% OP diets. Cecal and rectal populations of E. coli O157:H7 were reduced (P < 0.05) by inclusion of both 5 and 10% OP diets. Our results demonstrate that orange peel products can be used as a preharvest intervention strategy as part of an integrated pathogen reduction scheme.",

      "abstract": "Salmonella can live undetected in the gut of food animals and be transmitted to humans. Animal diets can impact intestinal populations of foodborne pathogens, including Salmonella spp. Orange juice production results in a waste product, orange peel and orange pulp, which has a high nutritive value and is often included in cattle diets as a least-cost ration ingredient. Here we show that the inclusion of orange peel products reduced Salmonella Typhimurium populations in the gut of experimentally inoculated sheep. Sheep (n=24) were fed a cracked corn grain-based high grain diet that was supplemented with a 50%/50% (dry matter [DM], w/w) mixture of dried orange pellet and fresh orange peel to achieve a final concentration (DM, basis) of 0%, 10%, or 20% orange product (OP) for 10 days before inoculation with Salmonella Typhimurium. Sheep were experimentally inoculated with 10(10) colony forming units Salmonella Typhimurium, and fecal samples were collected every 24 h after inoculation. Sheep were humanely euthanized at 96 h after oral Salmonella inoculation. Populations of inoculated Salmonella Typhimurium were numerically reduced by OP treatment throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and this reduction only reached significant levels in the cecum (p<0.05) of sheep fed 10% OP diets. Apparent palatability issues decreased the consumption of OP in sheep fed 20% OP to intake levels below that of 10% OP (approximately 7% dry matter intake [DMI]/d feed refusal), thereby reducing the potential effects of OP feeding at this higher level. Our results demonstrate that orange peel and pellets are environmentally friendly and low-cost products that can be used as a pre-harvest intervention as part of an integrated pathogen reduction scheme.",

METHOD: AA model was induced in male Wistar (correction of SD) rats by immunization with Freund's complete adjuvant Pad thickness was assayed by caliper. Pathological impairment of ankle joint was analysised by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-1beta and prostaglandin (PG) E2 in serum was detected by radioimmunoassay method. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in synovium tissues was measured by Western blot assay. RESULT: The 75 mg x kg(-1) and 150 mg x kg(-1) TFO treatment obviously decreased the pad thickness and improve the pathological impairment of ankle joint of AA rats. In addition, abnormal elevation of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and PGE2 in serum and COX-2 expression in synovium tissues of AA rats were markedly repressed by TFO treatment. CONCLUSION: TFO can inhibit the development of AA in rats, and the mechanism were likely due to depressing inflammatory mediators production.",

Following a pre-treatment to extract D-limonene, the anaerobic digestion of orange peel waste was evaluated at laboratory and pilot scale under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. D-limonene removals of 70% were reached with pre-treatment. The results showed the convenience of thermophilic conditions for treating this waste as the methane production rate and biodegradability were higher than at mesophilic temperature. At pilot scale, a thermophilic continuously stirred-tank reactor working in semi-continuous mode was employed. The OLR was found to be in the range of 1.20-3.67 kg COD/m(3) d; the most appropriate range for working under stable conditions at SRT of 25 d. The methane yield coefficient was found to be 0.27-0.29 L(STP)CH(4)/g added COD and the biodegradability 84-90% under these conditions. However, acidification occurred at the highest OLR.",

Adsorption isotherms of Cu2+ and Cd2+ on orange peel and mercapto-acetic acid modified orange peel were obtained and analyzed with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The rates of adsorption of Cu2+ and Cd2+ on both adsorbents were found to follow a pseudo-second order equation, indicating their chemical adsorption. Maximum adsorption capacities of Cu2+ and Cd2+ on the mercapto-acetic acid modified orange peel were found to be 70.67 and 136.05 mg/g, respectively. Adsorption-desorption studies showed that the mercapto-acetic acid modified orange peel could be used more than five cycles.

Citrus flavonoids exert a broad spectrum of biological activity, including antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in cancer cells. We have recently shown that individual PMFs from orange peel induce Ca(2+)-mediated apoptosis in human breast cancer cells and that hydroxylation of PMFs is critical for enhancing their proapoptotic activity. Here, we report that the fraction of orange peel extract containing a mixture of non-hydroxylated PMFs (75.1%) and hydroxylated PMFs (5.44%) and the fraction containing only hydroxylated PMFs (97.2%) induce apoptosis in those cells as well. Treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with these fractions inhibited growth and induced apoptosis associated with an increase in the basal level of intracellular Ca(2+). Effective concentrations of the hydroxylated PMFs fraction in inhibiting growth, inducing apoptosis, and increasing intracellular Ca(2+) were lower than those of the non-hydroxylated PMFs fraction. Our results strongly imply that bioactive PMFs from orange peel exert proapoptotic activity in human breast cancer cells, which depends on their ability to induce an increase in intracellular Ca(2+ )and thus, activate Ca(2+)-dependent apoptotic proteases.",

      "abstract": "A study of the anaerobic digestion of wastewater from the pressing of orange peel generated in orange juice production was carried out in a laboratory-scale completely stirred tank reactor at mesophilic temperature (37 degrees C). Prior to anaerobic treatment the raw wastewater was subjected to physicochemical treatment using aluminum sulfate as a flocculant and to pH reduction using a solution of sulfuric acid. The reactor was batch fed at COD loads of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 g of COD. The process was very stable for all of the loads studied, with mean pH and alkalinity values of 7.5 and 3220 mg of CaCO3/L, respectively. The anaerobic digestion of this substrate was found to follow a first-order kinetic model, from which the specific rate constants for methane production, K(G), were determined. The K(G) values decreased considerably from 0.0672 to 0.0078 L/(g h) when the COD load increased from 1.5 to 5.0 g of COD, indicating an inhibition phenomenon in the system studied. The proposed model predicted the behavior of the reactor very accurately, showing deviations of <5% between the experimental and theoretical values of methane production. The methane yield coefficient was found to be 295 mL of CH4 STP/g of COD removed, whereas the mean biodegradability of the substrate (TOC) was 88.2%. A first-order kinetic model for substrate (TOC) consumption allowed determination of the specific rate constants for substrate uptake, K(C), which also decreased with increasing loading, confirming the above-mentioned inhibition process. Finally, the evolution of the individual volatile fatty acid concentrations (acetic, C2; propionic, C3; butyric, C4; isobutyric, iC4; valeric, C5; isovaleric, iC5; and caproic, C6) with digestion time for all loads used was also studied. The main acids generated were acetic and propionic for all loads studied, facilitating the conversion into methane.",
