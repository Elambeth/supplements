      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is crucial in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care; yet, challenges exist in its implementation. This study addresses a knowledge gap by examining the most effective ways to introduce SSC in the NICU, emphasizing the need to seamlessly integrate this practice for optimal infant and parent care. One way, among many, to implement SSC is to increase staff's knowledge and awareness about SSC. OBJECTIVE: To describe the effect of an educational intervention on SSC time, the number of SSC sessions per day, and the number of infants cared for with SSC within their first day of life. METHODS: A pre- and postinterventional study design was used to determine the effect of an educational intervention on SSC time, the number of SSC sessions per day, and the number of infants cared for with SSC within their first day of life. RESULTS: The prevalence of infants receiving SSC during their first 24 hours of life, the number of SSC sessions per day, and the duration of each SSC session increased after the intervention, and these effects persisted over 2 years. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our study highlights the impact of staff education and reflective discussions on SSC in the NICU. Integrating these with practical training, parental education, and NICU environment modifications is pivotal for enhancing and sustaining optimal SSC practices, benefiting both infants and parents."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between inpatient skin-to-skin care rates and neurodevelopmental scores measured at 12 months in very preterm (VPT) infants. STUDY DESIGN: From a retrospective review of medical records of 181 VPT infants (<32 weeks gestational age [GA] at birth), we derived skin-to-skin care rate, ie, total minutes of skin-to-skin care each infant received over the number of days of hospital stay. We used scores on the Capute Scales from routine follow-up assessments at 12 months to measure neurodevelopmental outcomes. RESULTS: Families averaged approximately 17 minutes/day of skin-to-skin care (2 days/week, 70 minutes/session), although there was substantial variability. Variation in skin-to-skin rate was positively associated with outcomes at 12 months corrected age (r = 0.25, P < .001). Skin-to-skin rate significantly predicted 6.2% unique variance in 12-month neurodevelopmental outcomes, after adjusting for GA, socioeconomic status (SES), health acuity, and visitation frequency. A 20-minute increase in skin-to-skin care per day was associated with a 10-point increase (0.67 SDs) in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 months. GA and infant health acuity did not moderate these relations. CONCLUSION: VPT infants who experienced more skin-to-skin care during hospitalization demonstrated higher scores on 12-month neurodevelopmental assessments. Results provide evidence that skin-to-skin care confers extended benefits to VPT infants through the first year of life. Skin-to-skin care offers promise as a family-centered intervention designed to promote positive developmental outcomes in at-risk infants.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To improve rates of exclusive breastfeeding during the postpartum hospital stay by implementing a new role of dedicated neonatal assessment nurse (NAN), whose primary function was neonatal care beginning immediately after birth. DESIGN: Quality improvement project with plan-do-study-act using evidence-based guidelines for implementing the NAN role. SETTING/LOCAL PROBLEM: Labor and delivery department of a tertiary care teaching hospital in the southeastern United States; breastfeeding exclusivity rates at this hospital were in the range of 50%. PARTICIPANTS: Registered nurses employed in the labor-delivery-recovery unit, mother-baby unit, and NICU. INTERVENTION/MEASUREMENTS: The NAN role was implemented to promote immediate skin-to-skin care (SSC) for stable newborns after vaginal and cesarean birth. Each NAN's competency was evaluated at the beginning and end of the education session through a pretest/posttest, and a skills validation was used to affirm their readiness for the new role. The outcome measure was breastfeeding exclusivity at the time of discharge from the hospital. SSC initiation and duration immediately after birth were the process measures. RESULTS: Twenty-five bedside registered nurses participated in this quality improvement project. There was a statistically significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores (p < .001), indicating a knowledge increase. All nurses met the skills validation criteria. The rate of SSC immediately after vaginal birth increased from 49% to 82% and after cesarean birth from 33% to 63%. Breastfeeding exclusivity rate at the time of discharge from the hospital increased from 50% to 86%. CONCLUSION: The NAN role provided transitional care at the bedside without the separation of mothers and newborns. This was an innovative role, without the need to hire new staff, that provided evidence-based care, resulting in improved SSC and exclusivity of breastfeeding before discharge.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of immediate skin-to-skin care (SSC) versus swaddling in pain response to intramuscular injection of vitamin K at 30 min of birth in neonates. METHODS: Healthy full-term newborns were enrolled immediately after normal vaginal delivery and randomized in two groups, SSC and swaddling. Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was measured before, immediately after and at 2 min after the injection. RESULTS: Total 100 newborns were enrolled in the study (50 in each group). The mean (SD) birth weight of newborns in the SSC and swaddling group was 2668 (256) and 2730 (348) g, respectively. NIPS was comparable between the SSC and swaddling at before [1.78 (0.58) vs. 1.96 (0.83), p = 0.21], and immediately after the injection [4.82 (0.72) vs. 5.08 (0.75), p = 0.08]. NIPS at 2 min after the injection was significantly low in the SSC group compared to the swaddling group [1.38 (0.70) vs. 2.88 (1.00), p < 0.001]. At 2 min after injection, the NIPS score was significantly lower than baseline in the SSC group (p = 0.002), while it was significantly higher in the swaddling group (p < 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of newborns had a NIPS score of more than three at 2 min after injection in the swaddling group as compared to the SSC group (22% vs. 2%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Immediate SSC was more efficacious as compared to swaddling as a pain control intervention while giving vitamin K injection.

Kangaroo Care (KC) is practiced in NICUs across the world and is stress-relieving. Whether mindfulness practiced during KC in the NICU reduces parental distress has not yet been studied. The objective was to explore the feasibility and acceptability of teaching and practicing mindfulness during KC for mothers of premature babies. The objective was also to document preliminary outcomes of Mindful Kangaroo Care (MKC) on maternal stress, anxiety, depression, and mindful awareness. METHODS: In this pilot randomized controlled study, mothers of premature babies who were expected to stay in the NICU for at least four weeks were taught two mindfulness exercises to practice during KC and compared to mothers who received standard care with no mindfulness teaching. Mothers filled out stress, anxiety, depression and mindful awareness scales at recruitment and after four weeks. Acceptability and feasibility questionnaires were also completed. RESULTS: Fifteen mothers per group completed the study. The MKC group demonstrated a significant within-group reduction in anxiety (p = 0.003), depression (p = 0.02) and stress (p = 0.002), and a significant increase in both the curiosity (p = 0.008) and decentering (p = 0.01) scores of the Toronto Mindfulness Scale, all of which had medium to large effect sizes. Only the increases in curiosity and decentering were significant between groups. Fourteen mothers found the intervention acceptable, one neutral. CONCLUSION: MKC was acceptable, feasible and led to a reduction in stress, anxiety and depression in mothers who practiced mindfulness exercises during KC.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether early polyethylene bag use with skin-to-skin care compared with skin-to skin care alone reduce hypothermia among infants born at term in resource-limited settings. STUDY DESIGN: Infants born at term in the tertiary referral center in Lusaka, Zambia, were randomized using sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes in 2 phases: after birth (phase 1) and at 1 hour after birth (phase 2) to either skin-to-skin care with polyethylene bags or skin-to-skin care alone. Infant and maternal temperatures were recorded at birth, 1 hour, and every 4 hours until discharge or 24 hours. RESULTS: We enrolled 423 infants from May 2017 to August 2017. The rate of moderate-severe hypothermia (temperature <36.0°C) at 1 hour was 72 of 208 (34.6%) in the skin-to-skin care with a polyethylene bag group compared with 101 of 213 (47.4%) in the skin-to-skin care alone group (relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; P < .01; number needed to treat = 8). phase 1 treatment assignment significantly modified the effect of phase 2 treatment (P = .02 for interaction effect). Among infants randomized to skin-to-skin care with a polyethylene bag in phase 1, the risk of moderate-severe hypothermia was decreased in infants randomized to continue this intervention until discharge compared with infants randomized to skin-to-skin care alone. The rates of severe hypothermia, hyperthermia, and other adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Low-cost polyethylene bags started after birth in combination with skin-to-skin care reduced moderate or severe hypothermia at 1 hour and at discharge among infants born at term in a resource-limited setting compared with skin-to-skin care alone.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 decades, the prevalence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has increased almost 5-fold. Skin-to-skin care (SSC), a method of parent-infant holding, is a recommended nonpharmacologic intervention for managing NAS symptoms. SSC has the potential to reduce withdrawal symptoms while positively influencing parent-infant attachment. Yet, little is known about the SSC experiences of mothers of infants with NAS. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the SSC experiences of mothers of infants with NAS, including perceived barriers to SSC in the hospital and following discharge home. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design was used to obtain new knowledge regarding the experience of SSC of mothers of infants with NAS. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants eligible for the study. We conducted semistructured individual interviews with postpartum mothers of infants with NAS. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Thirteen mothers participated in the study. Four themes emerged from the data analysis: \"a little nerve racking\"; \"she needed me, and I needed her\"; dealing with the \"hard times\"; and \"a piece of my puzzle is missing.\" SSC was described as a conduit for healing and bonding; in addition, several barriers to SSC were reported. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: These findings highlight the inherent benefits of SSC for infants with NAS and demonstrate the unique challenges of these mother-infant dyads. Critical changes in hospital practices are needed to create an environment supportive of SSC for this patient population. In addition, research regarding implementation of interventions to increase SSC usage in this population is warranted.",

METHODS: This was a prospective single-center observational cohort study conducted in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit. The study consisted of four phases: (1) baseline measurements in an incubator for 30 min; (2) quiet SSC for 30 min (SSC-Pre); (3) SSC with live maternal singing accompanied by live guitar music for 20 min (SSC-Music); (4) final quiet SSC for another 30 min (SSC-Post). RESULTS: The primary outcome measure of mean rSO2 for the 31 preterm infants analyzed showed a significant increase from baseline during SSC-Music (76.87% vs 77.74%, p = 0.04) and SSC-Post (76.87% vs 78.0%, p = 0.03) phases. There were no significant changes observed in heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE). The coefficient of variation (CV) of rSO2 and SpO2 decreased during each intervention phase. CONCLUSION: Combining music therapy with SSC appears to be safe in preterm neonates. The impact of the small increase in rSO2 and reduced variability of SpO2 and rSO2 warrants further investigation. IMPACT: Music therapy combined with skin-to-skin care (SSC) is safe in clinically stable premature infants and could be encouraged as part of developmental care. This is the first report where near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to detect the simultaneous effect of music therapy and SSC on cerebral rSO2 in preterm infants. Music therapy with SSC caused a modest increase in rSO2 and decreased the coefficient of variation of rSO2 and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), which suggest short-term benefits for preterm infants.",

PARTICIPANTS: Thirty women whose infants were hospitalized for neonatal cardiac surgery. METHODS: Participants acted as their own controls before, during, and after SSC at two time points: once before and once after surgery. We measured the stress response of mothers, as indicated by self-reported scores of anxiety and maternal salivary cortisol, and maternal-infant attachment, as indicated by self-reported scores and maternal salivary oxytocin. RESULTS: Significant reductions in self-reported scores of anxiety and salivary cortisol were found as a result of SSC at each time point, as well as increased self-reported attachment. No significant differences were found in oxytocin. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide initial evidence of the benefits of SSC as a nurse-led intervention to support maternal attachment and reduce physiologic and psychological stress responses in mothers of infants with critical congenital heart disease before and after neonatal cardiac surgery.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of skin-to-skin care on stress, pain, behavioral organization, and physiologic stability of infants with critical congenital heart disease before and after neonatal cardiac surgery. DESIGN: A baseline response-paired design was used, with infants acting as their own controls before, during, and after skin-to-skin care at two distinct time points: once in the preoperative period (T1) and once in the postoperative period (T2). SETTING: Cardiac ICU and step-down unit in a large metropolitan freestanding children's hospital. SUBJECTS: Convenience sample of 30 infants admitted preoperatively for critical congenital heart disease. INTERVENTIONS: Eligible infants were placed into skin-to-skin care for 1 hour with their biological mothers once each at T1 and T2. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Measurements of stress (salivary cortisol), pain and behavior state (COMFORT scale), and physiologic stability (vital signs) were assessed immediately before skin-to-skin care, 30 minutes into skin-to-skin care, and 30 minutes after skin-to-skin care ended.At both T1 and T2, infant pain scores were significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) and infants moved into a calmer behavior state (p < 0.0001) during skin-to-skin care as compared to baseline. At T1, infants also had significantly reduced heart rate (p = 0.002) and respiratory rate (p < 0.0001) and increased systolic blood pressure (p = 0.033) during skin-to-skin care. At both T1 and T2, infant cortisol remained stable and unchanged from pre-skin-to-skin care to during skin-to-skin care (p = 0.096 and p = 0.356, respectively), and significantly increased from during skin-to-skin care to post-skin-to-skin care (p = 0.001 and p = 0.023, respectively). Exploratory analysis revealed differences in cortisol reactivity for infants with higher baseline cortisol (> 0.3 μg/dL) versus lower (≤ 0.3 μg/dL) prior to skin-to-skin care. Infants with higher baseline cortisol at T2 experienced significantly reduced cortisol during skin-to-skin care (p = 0.025). No significant differences in demographics or baseline variables were found between infants in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Skin-to-skin care is a low-cost, low-risk intervention that promotes comfort and supports physiologic stability in infants before and after neonatal cardiac surgery.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin-to-skin care (SSC) has been integrated as an essential component of developmental care for preterm infants. Despite documented benefits, SSC is not routinely practiced in the cardiac and surgical neonatal intensive care unit, with a predominantly term population, due to staff apprehension, patient factors and acuity, and environmental constraints. PURPOSE: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to increase SSC, parental holds, and parent touch events for infants in our cardiac and surgical neonatal intensive care unit. When traditional SSC was not possible, alternative holds and alternative parent touch (APT) methods were encouraged. METHODS: Quality improvement and qualitative descriptive methodology were utilized to assess baseline, develop education and practice changes, and evaluate the use of SSC, holds, and APT methods at 12 and 18 months postintervention. Implementation included educational tools and resource development, simulations, peer champions, in-class teaching, and team huddles. Decisions around the type of hold and parent touch were fluid and reflected complex infant, family, staff, and physical space needs. FINDINGS: Given its initial scarcity, there was an increased frequency of SSC and variety of holds or APT events. Staff survey results indicated support for the practice and outlined persistent barriers. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Skin-to-skin care, holds, and APT practices are feasible and safe for term and preterm infants receiving highly instrumented and complex cardiac and surgical care. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Future research regarding the intervention's impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants and on parent resilience in the surgical and cardiac neonatal intensive care unit is warranted.",

Interview questions were developed and aimed to understand the common meaning of this experience by learning about women's prior concerns and expectations of skin-to-skin care during cesarean birth, and how these experiences were realized during the intervention. A purposive sample (N = 13) was recruited through social media. Participants had skin-to-skin care, post-cesarean birth, in the last 10 years and were interviewed via Facebook Messenger video chat. The themes that emerged revealed the importance these women placed on their skin-to-skin care experience. The results of this study reinforce the importance of advocating for and implementing skin-to-skin care during cesarean birth whenever possible."

We described maternal/newborn measures of physiologic stability and stress; maternal measures of comfort; maternal satisfaction with surgery and SSC; and exclusive breast milk feeding at discharge. Materials and Methods: We used a quasiexperimental, time-interrupted design and randomly assigned women to receive SSC that began during surgery (Group 1, intervention; n = 20) or after surgery, before transfer to recovery (Group 2, standard care; n = 20). We analyzed differences across time and for five observations: before transfer to the operating room (OR); in the OR, about 20 minutes after birth; in the recovery room, about 1 hour after admission; in the New Family Center (NFC), about 1 hour after admission; and in the NFC, about 2 hours after admission. Results: Group 1 began SSC an average of 0.89 minutes after birth and continued an average of 300 minutes and Group 2 began an average of 46 minutes after birth and continued an average of 126 minutes. Women who began SSC during surgery were more satisfied with the experience (p = 0.015) and had lower levels of salivary cortisol across time (p = 0.003). We found no negative effects on maternal or newborn measures of physiologic stability and no difference in exclusive breast milk feeding rates at discharge. Conclusion: Immediate and uninterrupted SSC during medically uncomplicated cesarean surgery is a feasible, low-cost intervention that can safely begin during surgery and continue, uninterrupted, for extended durations.",

METHODS: A pilot randomized controlled trial [RCT] of an intervention aiming at reducing light and noise levels during SSC was conducted. Twenty-one neonatal nurses from a level III NICU completed questionnaires assessing their acceptability of NICU light and noise levels reduction during SSC, whether it interfered with their care delivery, in addition to acceptability of specific interventions reducing these levels. FINDINGS: The majority of nurses considered that the reduction of NICU light and noise levels during SSC was acceptable in general, did not interfere with their care delivery, and that the nine selected interventions were also acceptable. CONCLUSION AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: Nurses found it acceptable to reduce NICU light and noise levels during SSC. These findings support the conduct of a full-scale RCT to evaluate the effect of such an intervention on preterm infants and mothers' well-being.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mothers of preterm or low birthweight (LBW) infants are at two to three times greater risk of postpartum depression (PPD) than mothers of healthy infants, which may be partially due to mother-infant separation during hospitalization. Skin-to-skin care could protect against PPD among these vulnerable mothers. We examined the effect of skin-to-skin care on PPD among mothers of preterm or LBW infants through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched six peer-reviewed databases for prospective studies of skin-to-skin interventions that took place in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), used a validated PPD tool, and were published in English between 1979 and 2017. Data were standardized and pooled using Hedges method in a quality-weighted meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eight studies detailing seven interventions met inclusion criteria. Intervention characteristics varied with duration ranging from one week to over two months, skin-to-skin sessions ranging from 15 min to 1 h, and frequency ranging from thrice daily to thrice weekly. Five PPD tools were used predominantly as continuous measures. Meta-analysis demonstrated that skin-to-skin interventions were associated with a 1.04% reduction in standardized depression scores versus standard care (p < 0.001), though high heterogeneity was evident (I2 = 82.4%, p < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: Studies differed markedly with respect to design and intervention features, and were methodologically limited by using continuous depressive scores (not dichotomous PPD diagnoses) as the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Skin-to-skin care has a small protective effect on maternal depressive scores, however the clinical relevance of this finding is arguably minimal. Additional well-designed studies are warranted to conclusively assess the effects of skin-to-skin on PPD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are exposed to many stressors. There is growing evidence that chronic stress early in life has long-term neurodevelopmental implications. Skin-to-skin care (SSC) is an intervention used to reduce stress in the NICU. CLINICAL QUESTION: In premature infants in the NICU, what is the available evidence that SSC improves short-term physiologic stress outcomes compared with incubator care? SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed and CINAHL were searched for terms related to SSC, stress, physiology, and premature infants. Of 1280 unique articles, 19 were identified that reported on research studies comparing SSC with incubator care in the NICU and reported stress-related physiologic outcome measures. RESULTS: Although there have been some mixed findings, the research supports that SSC improves short-term cardiorespiratory stress outcomes compared with incubator care. The evidence is clearer for studies reporting stress hormone outcomes, with strong evidence that SSC reduces cortisol and increases oxytocin levels in preterm infants. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: SSC is safe and has stress-reducing benefits. SSC should be considered an essential component to providing optimal care in the NICU. More research is needed to determine the timing of initiation, duration, and frequency of SSC to optimize the stress-reducing benefits. Future research should include the most fragile infants, who are most likely to benefit from SSC, utilize power analyses to ensure adequate sample sizes, and use sophisticated data collection and analysis techniques to more accurately evaluate the effect of SSC on infants in the NICU.",

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective pre- and postintervention study. We compared late preterm and term infants at-risk for NH born in a 1-year period before the SSC intervention, May 1, 2013, to April 30, 2014 (pre-SSC) to at-risk infants born in the year following the implementation of SSC intervention, May 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015 (post-SSC). RESULTS: The number of hypoglycemia admissions to neonatal intensive care unit among at-risk infants for NH decreased significantly from 8.1% pre-SSC period to 3.5% post-SSC period (P = 0.018). The number of infants receiving intravenous dextrose bolus in the newborn nursery also decreased significantly from 5.9% to 2.1% (P = 0.02). Number of infants discharged exclusively breastfeeding increased from 36.4% to 45.7%, although not statistically significant (P = 0.074). CONCLUSION: This SSC intervention, as implemented in our hospital, was associated with a significant decrease in newborn hypoglycemia admissions to neonatal intensive care unit. The SSC intervention was safe and feasible with no adverse events."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin-to-skin care (SSC), often referred to as 'kangaroo care' (KC) due to its similarity with marsupial behaviour of ventral maternal-infant contact, is one non-pharmacological intervention for pain control in infants. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives were to determine the effect of SSC alone on pain from medical or nursing procedures in neonates compared to no intervention, sucrose or other analgesics, or additions to simple SSC such as rocking; and to determine the effects of the amount of SSC (duration in minutes), method of administration (e.g. who provided the SSC) of SSC in reducing pain from medical or nursing procedures in neonatesThe secondary objectives were to determine the safety of SSC care for relieving procedural pain in infants; and to compare the SSC effect in different postmenstrual age subgroups of infants. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 1); MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 25 February 2016); Embase (1980 to 25 February 2016); and CINAHL (1982 to 25 February 2016). We also searched clinical trials' databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies with randomisation or quasi-randomisation, double- or single-blinded, involving term infants (≥ 37 completed weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) to a maximum of 44 weeks' PMA and preterm infants (< 37 completed weeks PMA) receiving SSC for painful procedures conducted by healthcare professionals. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The main outcome measures were physiological or behavioural pain indicators and composite pain scores. A mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model was reported for continuous outcome measures. We included variations on type of tissue-damaging procedure, provider of care, and duration of SSC. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-five studies (n = 2001 infants) were included. Nineteen studies (n = 1065) used heel lance as the painful procedure, one study combined venepuncture and heel stick (n = 50), three used intramuscular injection (n = 776), one used 'vaccination' (n = 60), and one used tape removal (n = 50). The studies were generally strong and had low or uncertain risk of bias. Blinding of the intervention was not possible, making them subject to high risk, depending on the method of scoring outcomes.Seventeen studies (n = 810) compared SSC to a no-treatment control. Although 15 studies measured heart rate during painful procedures, data from only five studies (n = 161) could be combined for a mean difference (MD) of -10.78 beats per minute (95% CI -13.63 to -7.93) favouring SSC. Meta-analysis of four studies (n = 120) showed no difference in heart rate following the painful procedure (MD 0.08, 95% CI -4.39 to 4.55). Two studies (n = 38) reported heart rate variability with no significant differences. Two studies (n = 101) in a meta-analysis on oxygen saturation at 30 and 60 seconds following the painful procedure did not show a difference. Duration of crying meta-analysis was performed on four studies (n = 133): two (n = 33) investigated response to heel lance (MD = -34.16, 95% CI -42.86 to -25.45), and two (n = 100) following IM injection (MD = -8.83, 95% CI -14.63 to -3.02), favouring SSC. Five studies, one consisting of two substudies (n = 267), used the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) as a primary outcome, which favoured SCC at 30 seconds (MD -3.21, 95% CI -3.94 to -2.47), at 60 seconds (3 studies; n = 156) (MD -1.64, 95% CI -2.86 to -0.43), and at 90 seconds (n = 156) (MD -1.28, 95% CI -2.53 to -0.04); but at 120 seconds there was no difference (n = 156) (MD 0.07, 95% CI -1.11 to 1.25). No studies on return of heart rate to baseline level, cortisol levels, and facial actions could be combined for meta-analysis findings.Eight studies compared SSC to another intervention with or without a no-treatment control. Two cross-over studies (n = 80) compared mother versus other provider (father, another female) on PIPP scores at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds with no significant difference. When SSC was compared to other interventions, there were not enough similar studies to pool results in an analysis. One study compared SSC (n = 640) with and without dextrose and found that the combination was most effective and that SSC alone was more effective than dextrose alone. Similarly, in another study SSC was more effective than oral glucose for heart rate (n = 95). SSC either in combination with breastfeeding or alone was favoured over a no-treatment control, but not different to breastfeeding. One study compared SSC alone and in combination with both sucrose and breastfeeding on heart rate (HR), NIPS scores, and crying time (n = 127). The combinations were more effective than SSC alone for NIPS and crying. Expressed breast milk was compared to SSC in one study (n = 50) and found both equally effective on PIPP scores. There were not enough participants with similar outcomes and painful procedures to compare age groups or duration of SSC. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: SSC appears to be effective as measured by composite pain indicators with both physiological and behavioural indicators and, independently, using heart rate and crying time; and safe for a single painful procedure. Purely behavioural indicators tended to favour SSC but with facial actions there is greater possibility of observers not being blinded. Physiological indicators were mixed although the common measure of heart rate favoured SSC. Two studies compared mother-providers to others, with non-significant results. There was more heterogeneity in the studies with behavioural or composite outcomes. There is a need for replication studies that use similar, clearly defined outcomes. Studies examining optimal duration of SSC, gestational age groups, repeated use, and long-term effects of SSC are needed. Of interest would be to study synergistic effects of SSC with other interventions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A number of significant recent research studies have used techniques of economic modelling to demonstrate the potential benefits of increasing breastfeeding rates in the UK overall, and specifically in neonatal care. This paper complements this growing body of evidence by presenting an economic analysis of data from an actual intervention, the 'Getting It Right From the Start' programme, which took place in the north of the UK during 2011-12, with the aim of increasing breastfeeding and kangaroo skin-to-skin care rates in neonatal units. METHODS: 'Getting It Right from the Start' was a pragmatic, multifaceted programme of change delivered under the auspices of the regional Health Innovation and Education Cluster, of which 17 were established in the UK in 2010. It engaged with 18 neonatal units in two Neonatal Networks with the aim of increasing kangaroo skin-to-skin care and breastfeeding rates. As part of the evaluation of the programme, we conducted an economic study comparing the overall costs and benefits of the intervention. RESULTS: Overall, the economic analysis demonstrated that for every £1 invested in the intervention to increase kangaroo skin-to-skin care and breastfeeding rates, between £4.00 and £13.82 of benefit was generated. This was spread across different healthcare settings and the timescale for the realisation of benefits will vary. The increases in kangaroo skin-to-skin care generated the greatest cost savings, with potential cost savings ranging between £668,000 (minimum cost assumptions) to more than £2 m (maximum cost assumptions). Increases in breastfeeding associated with the project generated between £68,486 and £582,432. The majority of the cost savings generated were associated with reductions in cases of gastroenteritis and necrotising enterocolitis. CONCLUSION: This was one of the first economic evaluations of an actual intervention to increase breastfeeding and kangaroo skin-to-skin care in neonatal units. It complements the existing economic models by demonstrating that a real intervention in clinical practice was both cost effective as well as clinically beneficial. Future interventions with similar methodology should be supported and considered likely to generate significant cost savings compared to outlay. Economic evaluation should be more frequently included in studies of practical interventions in clinical settings to increase breastfeeding."

      "abstract": "AIM: To synthesize and interpret qualitative research findings focusing on parental experiences of skin-to-skin care (SSC) for newborn infants. BACKGROUND: SSC induces many benefits for newborn infants and their parents. Three meta-analyses have been conducted on physiological outcomes, but no previous qualitative meta-synthesis on parental experiences of SSC has been identified. DESIGN: The present meta-synthesis was guided by the methodology described by Paterson and co-workers. DATA SOURCES: Four databases were searched, without year or language limitations, up until December 2013. Manual searches were also performed. The searches and subsequent quality appraisal resulted in the inclusion of 29 original qualitative papers from 9 countries, reporting experiences from 401 mothers and 94 fathers. REVIEW METHODS: The meta-synthesis entails a meta-data analysis, analysis of meta-method, and meta-theory in the included primary studies. Based on the three analyses, the meta-synthesis represents a new interpretation of a phenomenon. The results of the meta-data analysis have been presented as a qualitative systematic review in a separate paper. RESULTS: When synthesizing and interpreting the findings from the included analyses, a theoretical model of Becoming a parent under unfamiliar circumstances emerged. Providing SSC seems to be a restorative as well as an energy-draining experience. A supportive environment has been described as facilitating the restorative experience, whereas obstacles in the environment seem to make the provision of SSC energy-draining for parents. When the process is experienced as positive, it facilitates the growth of parental self-esteem and makes the parents ready to assume full responsibility for their child. CONCLUSION: The results show that SSC can be interpreted not only as a family-including and important health care intervention but also in terms of actually becoming a parent. The process of becoming a parent in this specific situation is influenced by external factors in three different levels; family and friends, community, and society at large. The descriptions of providing SSC are similar to what has previously been described as the natural process of becoming a mother or a father.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin-to-skin care (SSC), otherwise known as Kangaroo Care (KC) due to its similarity with marsupial behaviour of ventral maternal-infant contact, is one non-pharmacological intervention for pain control in infants. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives were to determine the effect of SSC alone on pain from medical or nursing procedures in neonates undergoing painful procedures compared to no intervention, sucrose or other analgesics, or additions to simple SSC such as rocking; and the effects of the amount of SSC (duration in minutes) and the method of administration (who provided the SSC, positioning of caregiver and neonate pair).The secondary objectives were to determine the incidence of untoward effects of SSC and to compare the SSC effect in different postmenstrual age subgroups of infants. SEARCH METHODS: The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Collaborative Review Group were used. Databases searched in August 2011: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library); Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews; MEDLINE (1950 onwards); PubMed (1975 onwards); EMBASE (1974 onwards); CINAHL (1982 onwards); Web of Science (1980 onwards); LILACS database (1982 onwards); SCIELO database (1982 onwards); PsycInfo (1980 onwards); AMED (1985 onwards); Dissertation-Abstracts International (1980 onwards). Searches were conducted throughout September 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies with randomisation or quasi-randomisation, double or single-blinded, involving term infants (> 37 completed weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) to a maximum of 44 weeks PMA and preterm infants (< 37 completed weeks PMA) receiving SSC for painful procedures conducted by doctors, nurses, or other healthcare professionals. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The main outcome measures were physiological or behavioural pain indicators and composite pain scores. A weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model was reported for continuous outcome measures. We included variations on type of tissue-damaging procedure, provider of care, and duration of SSC. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen studies (n = 1594 infants) were included. Fifteen studies (n = 744) used heel lance as the painful procedure, one study combined venepuncture and heel stick (n = 50), two used intramuscular injection, and one used 'vaccination' (n = 80). The studies that were included were generally strong and free from bias.Eleven studies (n = 1363) compared SSC alone to a no-treatment control. Although 11 studies measured heart rate during painful procedures, data from only four studies (n = 121) could be combined to give a mean difference (MD) of 0.35 beats per minute (95% CI -6.01 to 6.71). Three other studies that were not included in meta-analyses also reported no difference in heart rate after the painful procedure. Two studies reported heart rate variability outcomes and found no significant differences. Five studies used the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) as a primary outcome, which favoured SCC at 30 seconds (n = 268) (MD -3.21, 95% CI -3.94 to -2.48), 60 seconds (n = 164) (MD -1.85, 95% CI -3.03 to -0.68), and 90 seconds (n = 163) (MD -1.34, 95% CI -2.56 to -0.13), but at 120 seconds (n = 157) there was no difference. No studies provided findings on return of heart rate to baseline level, oxygen saturation, cortisol levels, duration of crying, and facial actions that could be combined for analysis.Eight studies compared SSC to another intervention with or without a no-treatment control. Two cross-over studies (n = 80) compared mother versus other provider on PIPP scores at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds with no significant difference. When SSC was compared to other interventions, there were not enough similar studies to pool results in an analysis. One study compared SSC with and without dextrose and found that the combination was most effective and that SSC alone was more effective than dextrose alone.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: SSC appears to be effective, as measured by composite pain indicators and including both physiological and behavioural indicators, and safe for a single painful procedure such as a heel lance. Purely behavioural indicators tended to favour SSC but there remains questionable bias regarding behavioural indicators. Physiological indicators were typically not different between conditions. Only two studies compared mother providers to others, with non-significant results. There was more heterogeneity in the studies with behavioural or composite outcomes. There is a need for replication studies that use similar, clearly defined outcomes. New studies examining optimal duration of SSC, gestational age groups, repeated use, and long-term effects of SSC are needed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the Newhints home visits intervention increased the adoption of skin-to-skin care (SSC), in particular, among low birthweight (LBW) (<2.5 kg) babies. METHODS: A cluster-randomised trial, with 49 Newhints zones and 49 control zones, was conducted in seven districts in the Brong Ahafo Region, Ghana. It included all live births between November 2008 and December 2009. In Newhints zones, existing community-based surveillance volunteers were trained to conduct home visits during which they weighed babies and counselled mothers of LBW babies on SSC. Performance of any SSC and SSC for more than 2 h was evaluated. RESULTS: Of 15,615 live births, 68.5% had recorded birthweights; 10.1% were LBW. Any SSC was 19.4% higher among babies in Newhints vs. control zones (risk ratio, RR: 1.81; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.40-2.35). Performance of SSC for more than 2 h was, however, low, at only 7.5%, although more than double compared with control zones (RR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.80-4.10). LBW babies visited and weighed by a volunteer were more likely to receive SSC (PA ny  = 0.005; P >  2 h  = 0.021), greater for LBW babies, particularly for more than 2 h of SSC (Pinteraction  = 0.050). CONCLUSION: Newhints successfully promoted the uptake of SSC in rural Ghana. Although findings are encouraging, promotion in rural community settings in sub-Saharan Africa is challenging. Lessons learned can help shape SSC promotion in efforts to increase adoption and save newborn lives.",

Community STSC has been implemented in large-scale trials in Asia and is recommended by WHO and UNICEF. In countries where the practice is entirely new, such as Ghana, STSC may need special educational approaches. OBJECTIVE: The dual aims of this study were to understand the acceptance and barriers to STSC in an African community setting and to use in-depth formative research to contribute to the success of a behavior-based health intervention. DESIGN: A rapid qualitative study with an intentionally small sample. SETTING: Kintampo, Ghana, a predominately rural, agrarian area in the center of the country with diverse ethnic groups in a forest-savannah transition zone. METHOD: Key informants were consulted through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to develop the pilot. Five mothers participated in pilot instruction (four refused), which included counseling and used a trials-of-improved-practices methodology; data from group discussion with traditional birth attendants were also included. RESULTS: It was difficult to overcome barriers to the practice (post partum pain, fear of harming the umbilicus), and less intractable barriers (traditional carrying practices, fear of causing harm, lack of back support, time constraints, breast feeding issues) were reported. CONCLUSION: Some study participants tried STSC but none did it continuously. As promotion of STSC could be vital for improving newborn survival in low resource settings, tackling perceived barriers may be an important way to increase acceptability of this practice.",

STUDY DESIGN: Measurements were performed in 26 extremely preterm infants (gestational age 22-26 weeks; postnatal age, 2-9 days) during pretest (in incubator), test (during SSC), and posttest (in incubator) periods. Infants' skin temperature and body temperature, ambient temperature, and relative humidity were measured. Evaporimetry was used to determine transepidermal water loss, and insensible water loss through the skin was calculated. RESULTS: The infants maintained a normal body temperature during SSC. Transfer to and from SSC was associated with a drop in skin temperature, which increased during SSC. Ambient humidity and temperature were lower during SSC than during incubator care. Insensible water loss through the skin was higher during SSC. CONCLUSION: SSC can be safely used in extremely preterm infants. SSC can be initiated during the first week of life and is feasible in infants requiring neonatal intensive care, including ventilator treatment. During SSC, the conduction of heat from parent to infant is sufficiently high to compensate for the increase in evaporative and convective heat loss. The increased water loss through the skin during SSC is small and should not affect the infant's fluid balance.",

The purposes of this project were to improve skin-to-skin care and exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge. METHODS: For Part 1, we used a descriptive observational design, with video-ethnography and interaction analysis (PRECESS-Practice, Reflection, Education and training, Combined with Ethnography for Sustainable Success), during a 5-day quality improvement pilot study in a U.S. hospital (August 13-17, 2010). For Part 2, we used electronic health record review to test for differences in monthly rates of skin-to-skin care and exclusive breastmilk feeding (baseline, July 2010; post-intervention, August-December 2010). RESULTS: In Part 1, 11 mothers and babies participated: 10 (91%) received immediate skin-to-skin care, eight (73%) received uninterrupted skin-to-skin care, nine (82%) planned to breastfeed, six (67%) of these babies were exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge, and five (83%) of the six babies who completed all nine instinctive stages during skin-to-skin care were exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge. In our subsequent review (Part 2), we found a significant improvement (25% above baseline) in the overall rate of skin-to-skin care across post-intervention months (Pearson χ(2)=23.798, df=5, p<0.000), predominantly from improvements in the cesarean section population. The rates of exclusive breastfeeding showed no significant change. CONCLUSIONS: The PRECESS immersion method may help to rapidly improve skin-to-skin care. Babies who undergo all nine stages during skin-to-skin care may be more likely to exclusively breastfeed. Mothers need support during skin-to-skin care to recognize their baby's readiness to breastfeed. Skin-to-skin care during cesarean surgery may reduce maternal stress and improve satisfaction with the surgical experience.",

As this is rarely researched the aim of this study was to explore experiences of skin-to-skin care in healthy mothers of healthy, full-term infants in the first days after birth. STUDY DESIGN: Using a lifeworld phenomenological approach, 20 women who had childbirth in hospital and were practising skin-to-skin care were interviewed 1-2 weeks after birth. Analysis of all interview texts was directed towards discovering qualitative meanings through a process of identifying meaning units. These were then clustered and analysed with the aim of describing themes of meaning and the essence of the phenomenon. FINDINGS: The mothers wanted to give their newborn child the best possible care and the skin-to-skin care started a positive spiral. A mutual interaction developed which acted as a generator releasing energy to the mother who wanted to continue the practice which in terms increased mother-infant affinity. Happiness, peace and satisfaction were expressed by the newborns; also a child who was crying or troublesome exhibited a positive response to skin-to-skin care. CONCLUSION: The study provides insight and knowledge which should guide attitudes and promote practices of this simple healthcare intervention; skin-to-skin contact care to healthy infants born at term. Healthcare professionals should support affinity between a mother and her newborn through facilitation and the provision of information about its benefits.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Two-thirds of women globally give birth at home, yet little data are available on use of skin-to-skin care (STSC) in the community. We describe the acceptability of STSC in rural Uttar Pradesh, India, and measured maternal, newborn, and ambient temperature in the home in order to inform strategies for introduction of STSC in the community. STUDY DESIGN: Community-based workers in intervention clusters implemented a community mobilization and behavior change communication program that promoted birth preparedness and essential newborn care, including adoption of STSC, with pregnant mothers, their families, and key influential community members. Acceptance of STSC was assessed through in-depth interviews and focus groups, and temperature was measured during home visits on day of life 0 or 1. RESULTS: Incidence of hypothermia (<36.5 degrees C) was high in both low birth weight (LBW) and normal birth weight (NBW) infants (49.2%, (361/733) and 43% (418/971), respectively). Mean body temperature of newborns was lower (P<0.01) in ambient temperatures <20 degrees C (35.9+/-1.4 degrees C, n=225) compared to > or =20 degrees C (36.5+/-0.9 degrees C, n=1450). Among hypothermic newborns, 42% (331/787) of their mothers had a lower temperature (range -6.7 to 0.1 degrees C, mean difference 0.4+/-1.2 degrees C). Acceptance of STSC was nearly universal. No adverse events from STSC were reported. STSC was perceived to prevent newborn hypothermia, enhance mother's capability to protect her baby from evil spirits, and make the baby more content. CONCLUSION: STSC was highly acceptable in rural India when introduced through appropriate cultural paradigms. STSC may be of benefit for all newborns and for many mothers as well. New approaches are needed for introduction of STSC in the community compared to the hospital.",

DESIGN: a randomised controlled trial comparing skin-to-skin with routine care. SETTING: Warrington Hospital, Cheshire, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 204 mother and baby pairs; 102 randomised to each group. OUTCOME MEASURES: success of first breast feed, maternal satisfaction with skin-to-skin care and preference for future post-delivery care, baby-body temperature 1 hr after birth, partial or exclusive breast feeding at 4 months. FINDINGS: in the skin-to-skin group, 89 out of 98 (91%) babies had a successful first feed compared with 82 out of 89 (83%) in the routine care group. The difference in the success rate was 8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-1.6%, 17.6%); chi(2)=2.7; df=1; P=0.10. Forty-two out of 97 (43%) babies given skin-to-skin were partially or exclusively breast feeding at 4 months compared with 40 out of 100 (40%) of babies in the routine care group. The difference in breast-feeding rate at 4 months was 3.3%, 95% CI (-10.3%, 16.7% ); chi(2)=0.22; df=1; P=0.64. The mean temperature 1 hr after birth was higher with skin-to-skin than routine care. The difference in means was 0.15 degrees C; 95% CI (0.03, 0.28); P=0.02. A larger proportion of mothers (87/97 [90%]) were very satisfied with skin-to-skin care, compared with 60 out of 102 (59%) in the control group; 83 out of 97 (86%) of the mothers in the intervention group said that they would prefer to receive the same care in the future compared with 31 out of 102 (30%) mothers in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: the difference between the groups in the success rate for the first breast feed and rates at 4 months was not statistically significant. However, mothers who had skin-to-skin contact enjoyed the experience, and most reported that they would choose to have skin-to skin care in the future. In this, the largest trial to date, previous concerns about baby-body temperature after skin-to-skin care were dispelled.",

      "abstract": "Infant colic affects about 20% of all infants and the cause remains elusive. Healthcare providers typically view infant colic as a minor inconvenience that is harmless to the thriving infant and will go away with time; however, parents view caring for a colicky infant as a crisis situation. The purpose of this feasibility study conducted via the internet was to examine the feasibility of implementing kangaroo care at the beginning of colicky episodes. Mothers of colicky infants began the study by completing the on-line Infant Colic Scale and recording in a baseline state-of-arousal diary for 3 days. Next, they implemented kangaroo care at the beginning of as many episodes of colic as possible for 2 weeks while recording in a second state-of-arousal diary. Then, they stopped kangaroo care for 2 days while continuing to record in the second state-of-arousal diary, and lastly they were asked how kangaroo care worked for them.Seventy-five parents of colicky infants consented to participate in this study; however, only five of them actually did. Three of these completed only the baseline state-of-arousal diary, and two completed all parts of the study. This dropout rate showed that conducting such an intervention via the internet is not a feasible approach. Because kangaroo care for infants with colic is a promising intervention and because there are no other effective treatments for most of these infants, another feasibility study is warranted using different methods. Then if results are promising, a larger clinical trial should be conducted.",

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with assignment by computerized minimization to kangaroo care (n = 48) or control (n = 43). SETTING: Postpartum units and neonatal intensive-care units (NICU). PARTICIPANTS: Preterm infants 32 to less than 37 weeks gestation and their mothers. INTERVENTION: Kangaroo (skin-to-skin, SS) care (KC). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type and percent time of mother-infant contact (SS versus holding wrapped in blankets). RESULTS: Analyses were based on four groups: assignment for infants in each group to postpartum or NICU. For KC dyads, SS postpartum was 22.0%; SS NICU was 7.5%. KC wrapped holding postpartum was 11.6%; NICU was 1.8%. For control dyads, wrapped holding postpartum was 13.9%; NICU was 6.1%. CONCLUSION: Amount of SS was much less than expected. Reasons include unavailability of infants or mothers and hospital staff interrupting contact. However, KC postpartum dyads were held wrapped almost as often as control postpartum dyads. Total contact time for KC dyads (SS plus wrapped) was more than double that of controls. These data suggest that hospital and social supports for families are needed to facilitate early initiation of SS, prolonged periods of mother-infant SS contact, and reduction of maternal stress.",

DESIGN: Naturalistic inquiry, using open-ended, transcribed and audiotaped face-to-face and telephone interviews. SETTING: Tertiary neonatal care setting and homes of parents. PARTICIPANTS: Eight mothers and one father who participated in skin-to-skin care. INTERVENTIONS: Two 60-minute skin-to-skin care sessions. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (a) ambivalence of parents toward skin-to-skin care, including subthemes of yearning to hold the infant and apprehension to do so; (b) need of a supportive environment; and (c) special quality of the parent-infant interaction, including subthemes of intense connectedness and active parenting. Perceptions of apprehension, need for a supportive environment, and active parenting differed between parents who continued skin-to-skin care during their infants' hospitalization and parents who did not. Three of the four parents who discontinued skin-to-skin care in the hospital resumed when their infants were home. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in narratives of parents highlighted the importance of individualizing the skin-to-skin experience to the needs of parent and infant. Parents who resumed skin-to-skin care at home valued the experience while their infant was hospitalized but needed intervention to alleviate their apprehension, enhance their feeling of autonomy, and modify the environment.",
