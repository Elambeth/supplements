      "abstract": "A bullous phototoxic reaction occurred in a 27-year-old man working with the plant Dictamnus albus. The skin changes disappeared, leaving behind areas of hyperpigmentation, after treatment with corticoid-containing ointments. Possible causes are 5- and 8-methoxypsoralen, perhaps also photodynamically active alkaloids of the plant, as well as sun-ray exposure and sweating. Dictamnus albus may be the biblical \"burning bush\". Since the plant becoming ever more popular in German gardens, a phytophototoxic reaction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the described symptoms.",
