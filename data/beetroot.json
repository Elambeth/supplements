      "abstract": "The global increase in prevalence of (pre-)diabetes demands immediate intervention strategies. In our earlier work, we demonstrated in vitro antidiabetic potential of a fermented beetroot product (PN39). Here, we examined the impact of PN39 on glucose tolerance and gut microbiota in C57BL/6J male mice and on prediabetic (PD) subjects' stool microbiota. In mice, high-fat diet (HFD) consumption for 9 weeks resulted in hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance (GT) while concomitant consumption of PN39 and HFD (PN39+HFD) prevented GT impairment. Meanwhile, feeding the mice with HFD for 5 weeks to induce PD and later administering them with PN39 for 4 weeks (PD + PN39) neither improved fasting blood glucose nor GT. Relative to control groups, the gut microbiota of both PD mice and humans were characterized by decreased Clostridia UCG-014 and Lactobacilli as well as significantly altered gut microbial carbohydrate metabolism. Feeding PN39 together with HFD preserved Clostridia UCG-014 and Lactobacilli, increased short chain fatty acid production relative to mice fed with HFD only. Treating gut microbiota of PD subjects with PN39 however increased Clostridia UCG-014 and Lactobacilli populations and increased short chain fatty acids concentrations in the stools. In both mice and humans, PN39 treatment rectified the altered microbial carbohydrate metabolism observed in their PD counterparts. This suggests that the gut microbial modulatory effects of PN39 coupled with its capacity to regulate gut microbial glucose metabolism, likely played a role in preventing PD in mice receiving PN39+HFD. Taken together, our results indicate that PN39 could act as a potent antidiabetic functional food for preventing diabetes and its associated dysbiosis."

      "abstract": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a circulatory disorder caused by atherosclerosis, leading to the narrowing or blockage of peripheral arteries, often affecting the arteries in the lower limbs. This condition can result in intermittent claudication and severe limb ischemia, significantly reducing patients' quality of life. In recent years, increasing evidence suggests that dietary interventions play a crucial role in the prevention and management of PAD, offering a safe and non-invasive treatment option. Beetroot, a natural root vegetable, demonstrates significant health benefits through its various bioactive compounds. It is rich in nitrate and betaine, which are metabolized in the body via the nitrate-nitrite- nitric oxide (NO) pathway, increasing the bioavailability of NO. NO is an important vasodilator that can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure. Additionally, the active compounds in beetroot may further enhance its health effects by altering the activity of the oral microbiome. This review explores the potential therapeutic effects of beetroot juice (BRJ) in the management of PAD. The findings indicate that BRJ can improve exercise performance, lower blood pressure, improve endothelial function, enhance skeletal muscle microvascular function and central autonomic nervous system function. Based on these findings, beetroot and its rich bioactive compounds hold promise as a novel supportive therapy for improving PAD.",

      "abstract": "Poor vascular function and reduced nitric oxide (NO)-bioavailability have been recognized to be involved in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A non-pharmacological treatment that is gaining clinical interest in the context of vascular function is dietary inorganic nitrate (NO3-) supplementation which increases NO-bioavailability through the NO3- -nitrite (NO2-) - NO pathway. This treatment has been demonstrated to improve vascular function in several clinical populations, but no study has investigated the effects in individuals with AD. Therefore, changes in plasma NO3- and NO2- and vascular responsiveness (hyperemic response to single-passive leg movement (ΔPLM)) were measured in individuals with AD (n = 10, 76 ± 9 years), healthy elderly (OLD, n = 10, 75 ± 6 years), and young individuals (YN, n = 10, 25 ± 4 years) before (T0) and hourly for 4 h (T1, T2, T3, and T4) after ingestion of either NO3--rich beetroot juice (BR) or a placebo (PLA). No changes in NO3- and NO2-, nor ΔPLM were detected in any group following PLA intake. Plasma NO3- and NO2- increased significantly in all three groups at T1 (p < 0.001) and remained elevated for the rest of the trial. The same trend was found in ΔPLM, which significantly increased in all three groups over the time (p < 0.001). However, AD exhibited significantly lower ΔPLM values at any time point compared to YN (p < 0.001) and OLD (p < 0.001). These data suggest that AD-individuals included in this study were able to reduce NO3- to NO2- and to increase NO-mediated vascular responsiveness as non-AD-individuals. Other mechanisms, beyond NO-bioavailability, may be involved in vascular dysfunction in patients with AD. This research suggests that an acute administration of inorganic nitrate is not enough to revert chronically adapted vascular properties and completely restore vascular responsiveness in AD.",

      "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that subgingival levels of nitrate-reducing bacteria, as well as the in vitro salivary nitrate reduction capacity (NRC), were diminished in periodontitis patients, increasing after periodontal treatment. However, it remains unclear if an impaired NRC in periodontitis can affect systemic health. To determine this, the effect of nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BRJ) on blood pressure was determined in 15 periodontitis patients before and 70 days after periodontal treatment (i.e., professional mechanical plaque removal, oral hygiene instruction, and subgingival instrumentation), as well as in a healthy control group of 15 individuals. Additionally, subgingival and tongue samples were taken to analyse the bacterial composition with Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. In healthy individuals, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DPB) decreased significantly (both P < 0.01) 90 min after BRJ intake, but not in periodontitis patients. However, after periodontal treatment, this blood pressure-lowering effect was recovered (P < 0.05 for SBP; P < 0.01 for DBP). Lower levels of salivary nitrate after identical doses of BRJ intake indicated a potentially higher NRC in healthy individuals (P < 0.05). Periodontitis-associated bacteria decreased in tongue and subgingival samples after periodontal treatment (P < 0.01). In contrast, nitrate-reducing bacteria were associated with health in both habitats, but increased only in subgingival plaque after periodontal treatment (P < 0.001). This is the first study showing that periodontitis could limit the blood-pressure lowering effects of nitrate reduction by the oral microbiota. We propose that an impaired NRC represents a potential link between periodontitis and systemic conditions, which should be confirmed in future randomized controlled trials. Future work should also aim to determine if nitrate prebiotic supplementation and/or tongue cleaning could improve the treatment of periodontitis and its associated comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Tungsten oxide (WO3) nanoparticles (WO3NPs) were prepared using beetroot (Beta vulgaris) extract. The synthesis was optimized by evaluating the effect of pH during the reduction of the WO3 precursor and sintering temperature. Physicochemical characterization of the formed nanoparticles was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-visible diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectroscopy. Furthermore, the prepared WO3NPs were employed as photocatalyst for rhodamine B removal over the photocatalytic oxidation mechanism. Synthesis optimization revealed that a single phase of WO3NPs obtained by reduction at pH 4 and a sintering temperature of 550 °C. XRD and XPS measurements revealed that the single-phase WO3NPs was obtained with a crystallite size of 26.4 nm. SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated polymorphic forms, predominantly as nanorods, with a mean particle size of 24 nm. The WO3NPs have a band gap energy of 2.9 eV, supporting their performance as a photocatalyst. Evaluation of the photocatalytic activities of WO3NPs represents high activity and reusability of the material. A removal efficiency of 99.67% was achieved during 30 min of treatment under UV light illumination. A study on the effect of scavengers revealed the important role of hydroxy radicals in the photocatalysis mechanism. WO3NPs can be recycled and reused for photocatalysis, maintaining photoactivity for five cycles.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Long-term effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (long COVID) develop in a substantial number of people following an acute COVID-19 episode. Red beetroot juice may have positive effects on multiple pathways involved in long COVID. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the impact of beetroot juice supplementation on physical function, gut microbiota, and systemic inflammation in adults with long COVID. METHODS: A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to test the effects of 14 days of beetroot juice supplementation, rich in nitrates and betalains, on functional and biological outcomes in adults aged between 20 and 60 years with long COVID. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either daily oral supplementation with 200 mL beetroot juice (∼600 mg nitrate) or placebo (∼60 mg nitrate) for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to day 14 in a fatigue resistance test. Secondary outcomes included the distance walked on the 6-min walk test, handgrip strength, and flow-mediated dilation. Secondary endpoints also included changes from baseline in circulating inflammatory mediators and metagenomic and fecal water metabolomic profiles. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were built to evaluate the differences in biological variables associated with the interventions. RESULTS: Thirty-one participants were randomized in the study. Twenty-five of them (median (interquartile range) age 40 (10), 14 [56 %] women), received either beetroot juice (15) or placebo (10) and completed the study. At 14 days, fatigue resistance significantly improved from baseline (mean difference [standard error]: +21.8 [3.7] s; p < 0.001) with no significant differences between intervention groups. A significant increase from baseline in the distance walked on the 6-min walk test was observed (mean difference [standard error]: +30.0 [9.4] m; p = 0.03), which was not different between groups. Flow-mediated dilation did not differ between participants who received beetroot juice and those on placebo. PLS-DA models allowed correct classification of participants with 92.2 ± 4.4 % accuracy. Those who ingested red beetroot juice had a greater abundance of bacteria with well-known beneficial effects, including Akkermansia, Oscillospira, Prevotella, Roseburia, Ruminococcaceae, and Turicibacter, compared with placebo. Participants allocated to beetroot juice supplementation were also characterized by significantly higher levels of fecal nicotinate, trimethylamine, and markers of beetroot juice intake (e.g., 5,6-dihydroxyindole). Finally, higher levels of interferon gamma and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β were found in participants who consumed beetroot juice. CONCLUSION: Beetroot juice supplementation for two weeks did not to induce significant improvements in functional outcomes in adults with long COVID compared with placebo. Beneficial effects were observed in both gut microbiota composition (i.e., increase in probiotic species) and inflammatory mediators.

Individuals may benefit from dietary NO3- supplementation by monitoring blood [NO3-] and [NO2-], although a simple and practical method for assessing blood [NO3-] and [NO2-] has not been established. We examined whether fingertip serum samples could substitute for venous plasma samples in assessing [NO3-] and [NO2-]. Ten young adults consumed 140 mL of nitrate-rich beetroot juice. Fingertip serum and venous plasma samples were collected at baseline and every hour for up to 4 h after ingestion. [NO3-] and [NO2-] were similar between samples at baseline, whereas they were higher in fingertip serum throughout the post-ingestion periods. Significant correlations existed between fingertip serum vs. venous plasma for both [NO3-] and [NO2-] throughout post-drink periods, except [NO3-] assessed at 2 and 4 h after ingestion of beetroot juice. We show that although fingertip serum [NO3-] and [NO2-] overestimate those measured by venous plasma after dietary NO3- intake (125-141% and 156-183% of venous values), [NO3-] and [NO2-] in fingertip serum samples may be utilized for assessing blood [NO3-] and [NO2-] levels, although [NO3-] assessment may lack precision compared to [NO2-].",

      "abstract": "Beta vulgaris L. is a root vegetable that is consumed mainly as a food additive. This study aimed to describe the protective effect of B. vulgaris on Fe2+-mediated oxidative liver damage through in vitro, ex vivo, and in silico studies to establish a strong rationale for its protective effect. To induce oxidative damage, we incubated the livers of healthy male rats with 0.1 mM FeSO4 to induce oxidative injury and coincubated them with an aqueous extract of B. vulgaris root (BVFE) (15-240 µg/mL). Induction of liver damage significantly (p < .05) decreased the levels of GSH, SOD, CAT, and ENTPDase activities, with a corresponding increase in MDA and NO levels and Na+/K+ ATPase, G6 Pase, and F-1,6-BPase enzyme activities. BVFE treatment (p < .05) reduced these levels and activities to almost normal levels, with the most prominent effects observed at 240 µg/mL BVFE. An HPLC investigation revealed sixteen compounds in BVFE, with quercetin being the most abundant. Chlorogenic acid and iso-orientation showed the highest binding affinities for G6 Pase and Na+/K + ATPase, respectively. These findings suggest that B. vulgaris can protect against Fe2+-mediated liver damage by suppressing oxidative stress and cholinergic and purinergic activities while regulating gluconeogenesis. Overall, the hepatoprotective activity of this extract might be driven by the synergistic effect of the identified compounds and their probable interactions with target proteins.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic constipation is a gastrointestinal functional disorder which affects patient quality of life. Therefore, many studies were oriented to search herbal laxative agents. In this study, we investigated the phytochemical composition of beetroot juice (BJ) and its laxative potential in an experimental model of constipation and colonic dysmotility induced by loperamide (LOP) in Wistar rats. METHODS: Animals were concurrently pretreated with LOP (3 mg/kg, b.w., i.p.) and BJ (5 and 10 mL/kg, b.w., p.o.), or yohimbine (2 mg/kg, b.w., i.p.), during 1 week. The laxative activity was determined based on the weight, frequency, and water content of the feces matter. The gastric-emptying test and intestinal transit were determined. Colon histology was examined, and oxidative status was evaluated using biochemical-colorimetric methods. KEY RESULTS: The in vivo study revealed that LOP induced a significant inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, negative consequences on defecation parameters, oxidative stress, and colonic mucosa lesions. Conversely, administration of BJ reestablished these parameters and restored colonic oxidative balance. Importantly, BJ treatment protected against LOP-induced inflammatory markers (pro-inflammatory cytokines and WBC) and the increase in intracellular mediators such as hydrogen peroxide, free iron, and calcium levels. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This study demonstrated that the bioactive compounds in BJ provided an anti-constipation effect by modulating intestinal motility and regulating oxidative stress and inflammation induced by LOP intoxication.",

      "abstract": "Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is not only associated with iron deficiency but has shown strong association with the over production of free radicles and deficiency of antioxidant enzymes. The result of this imbalance is oxidative stress (OS) which is now considered as an important associated factor with various diseases. Treating IDA in most of cases with oral iron supplements results in more OS as iron is a transition metal. A more suitable alternate for iron supplementation is Beta vulgaris supplement, which being herbal in origin is far less associated with side effects. We studied effects of beta vulgaris supplements on enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in IDA patients. A significant increase in all study parameters were observed after treatment (p <0.05). When pre-supplemental values of super oxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH-PX) of IDA were compared with post-supplemental values, they were significantly low (p <0.05). A positive correlation was noted between the two antioxidants and hemoglobin (Hb) values suggesting a direct relationship between antioxidant status and Hb levels. Non enzymatic antioxidants included vitamin A,C and E. We also found a significant improvement (p <0.05) of these vitamins when compared with their initial values and the control group. Our study shows improvement of antioxidant status of anemic patients with 12 week supplementation of Beta vulgaris.",

Five treatments were developed: the positive control group (COP) with the addition of nitrite and sodium erythorbate, negative control treatment (CON) with the addition of sodium erythorbate; ham added with beet powder (AP), ham added with beet powder and starter culture (APC), ham added with beet powder, starter culture, and sodium erythorbate (APCE). The ham's curing properties and oxidative stability were analyzed for 30 days under refrigeration. The APCE treatment showed better conversion of nitrate to nitrite at time 0 (46.6 mg/kg). The COP sample showed higher residual nitrite content at time 0 (73.1 mg/kg) and nitrosohemochrome pigment (35.67 ppm). Combining beet powder with the commercial starter culture and sodium erythorbate in the formulation of restructured cooked hams positively affected the control of lipid and protein oxidation, making it an alternative to commercial sodium nitrite. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Beetroot and arugula powders are added to the restructured cooked ham to prepare a clean-label meat product without sodium nitrite. The effects of starter culture and sodium erythorbate are also evaluated. .",

This study investigates beetroot juice (BRJ), betanin, and their liposomal formulations (Lip-BRJ, Lip-Bet) as photosensitizers in cancer PDT. BRJ was prepared, and its betanin content was quantified via HPLC. The p-nitrosodimethylaniline (RNO)/imidazole technique monitored the singlet oxygen formation. BRJ and betanin decreased the RNO absorbance at 440 nm by 12% and 9% after 45 min of irradiation, respectively. Furthermore, betanin interaction with Bcl-2 proteins was examined using binding free energy analysis and molecular dynamic simulation. The results revealed favorable interactions with ΔG values of -40.94 kcal/mol. Then, BRJ, betanin, Lip-BRJ, and Lip-Bet were tested as photosensitizers on normal (HEK 293) and human lung cancer (A549) cell lines. Irradiation significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of Lip-Bet on HEK 293 cells (20% cell viability at 2000 µg/mL) and A549 cells (13% cell viability at 1000 µg/mL). For Lip-BRJ, irradiation significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity on HEK 293 cells at lower concentrations and on A549 cells at all tested concentrations. These results proved the positive effect of light and liposomal encapsulation on the anticancer activity of betanin and BRJ, suggesting the efficiency of liposomal beetroot pigments as green photosensitizers."

      "abstract": "Physical inactivity and poor dietary choices contribute to the rise in cardiometabolic diseases in the United States. It remains critical to identify strategies that may mitigate the negative impact of these behaviors. Several studies have shown that the consumption of dietary inorganic nitrate may improve vascular health and glucose regulation in animal models and some human studies. However, the improvements in glucose regulation have yet to be corroborated in humans with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the acute effects of beetroot juice (BRJ) on glycemic and hemodynamic responses in individuals with T2D while controlling for medication. Seven participants with a clinical diagnosis of T2D were recruited into this study and were temporarily removed from blood pressure- and glucose-lowering medications. Hemodynamic measurements (pulsewave velocity) and an oral glucose tolerance test (glycemic response) were measured following consumption of either BRJ or a denitrolized placebo. Saliva and blood samples were collected at baseline and two and four hours post supplementation to measure changes in nitrate and nitrite concentrations. We detected significant improvements in total plasma glucose exposure (p = 0.022) and the SVR change score (p = 0.009) in the BRJ condition. This study demonstrated that BRJ consumption can improve oral glucose tolerance in individuals with T2D while controlling for medication; however, future larger-cohort randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm if BRJ is a viable treatment for glucose control in individuals with T2D.",

The search for bioactive components effective in the treatment of COPD has become a focal point of research. Beetroot juice, readily accessible and cost-effective, is noted for its ability to enhance athletic performance and for its preventive and therapeutic impact on hypertension. Beetroot juice is a rich source of dietary nitrates and modulates physiological processes via the nitrate-nitrite- nitric oxide pathway, exerting multiple beneficial effects such as antihypertensive, bronchodilatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, and lipid-lowering actions. This paper provides a review of the existing research on the effects of beetroot juice on COPD, summarizing its potential in enhancing exercise capacity, lowering blood pressure, improving vascular function, and ameliorating sleep quality among patients with COPD. The review serves as a reference for the prospective use of beetroot juice in the symptomatic improvement of COPD, as well as in the prevention of exacerbations and associated comorbidities.",

We aimed to investigate the effect of BRJ on BP in adults with hypertension according to the European Society of Hypertension Guidelines (clinical BP ≥ 140/≥ 90 mmHg) and whether BRJ can be considered as an adjunct to hypertension drug treatment, by conducting a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: PubMed, SCOPUS, Medline Ovid, Cinahl, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched from inception until April 13, 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials of BRJ versus placebo, water, or no intake. Risk of bias was assessed using a standardized appraisal instrument from the Swedish Agency for Health Technology and Assessment of Social Services, which is based on the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. The pooled BP effect size was calculated using random effects models and meta-regression. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Eleven trials (349 patients) were included. BRJ yielded a significant reduction in clinical systolic BP compared with placebo mean difference (MD) -5.31 mmHg (95% CI -7.46, -3.16; I2 = 64%, GRADE ⊕⊕OO). There was no significant effect on clinical diastolic BP or 24-h BP outcomes, and the heterogeneity was moderate to high. CONCLUSIONS: Daily ingestion of 200-800 mg of nitrate from BRJ may reduce clinical systolic BP in hypertensive individuals with no sign of development of tolerance. Certainty of evidence is low, and results should be interpreted with caution.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vascular oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation are important in the pathology of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. Cell culture and animal studies suggest that inorganic dietary nitrate may attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation through nitric oxide (NO), and there is a need to investigate whether this translates to humans. AIM: In this randomised, placebo-controlled crossover study, by measuring a combination of multiple blood biomarkers, we evaluated whether previously reported benefits of dietary nitrate translate to a reduced oxidative stress and an improved inflammation status in 15 men and women (age range: 56-71 years) with treated hypertension. METHODS: We investigated the effects of a single ∼400 mg-dose of nitrate at 3 h post-ingestion (3H POST) and the daily consumption of 2 × ∼400 mg of nitrate over 4 weeks (4WK POST), through nitrate-rich versus nitrate-depleted (placebo) beetroot juice. Measurements included plasma nitrate and nitrite (NOx), oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), F2-isoprostanes, protein carbonyls, oxidised (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (GSH); and serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion molecules. Flow cytometry was used to assess the relative proportion of blood monocyte subsets. RESULTS: At 4WK POST nitrate intervention, the oxLDL/NOx ratio decreased (mainly due to increases in plasma nitrate and nitrite) and the GSH/GSSG ratio (a sensitive biomarker for alterations in the redox status) increased, compared with placebo (for both ratios P < 0.01). The relative proportion of classical (CD14+CD16-) monocytes decreased at 4WK POST for placebo compared to nitrate intervention (P < 0.05). Other oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were not altered by increased nitrate intake relative to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study point toward a subtle alteration in the redox balance toward a less pro-oxidative profile by a regular intake of inorganic nitrate from plant foods.

Flavonoid-rich extracts of B. vulgaris fruit were evaluated for their antidiabetic and anti-alzheimic activities. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation were performed to identify potential bioactive flavonoids with dual therapeutic effects on T2D and AD. Flavonoid-rich extracts of B. vulgaris fruit (IC50 = 73.062 ± 0.480 μg mL-1) had moderate activity against α-amylase compared to the standard acarbose (IC50 = 27.104 ± 0.270 μg mL-1). Compared with acarbose, flavonoid-rich extracts of B. vulgaris fruit had appreciable activity against α-glucosidase (IC50 = 17.389 ± 0.436 μg mL-1) (IC50 = 37.564 ± 0.620 μg mL-1). For AChE inhibition, flavonoid-rich extracts of B. vulgaris fruit exhibited (p < 0.0001) inhibitory activity (IC50 = 723.260 ± 5.466 μg mL-1), albeit weaker than that of the standard control, galantamine (IC50 = 27.950 ± 0.122 μg mL-1). Similarly, flavonoid-rich extracts of B. vulgaris fruit showed considerable (p < 0.0001) inhibitory effects on BChE (IC50 = 649.112 ± 0.683 μg mL-1). In contrast, galantamine (IC50 = 23.126 ± 0.683 μg mL-1) is more potent than the extracts of B. vulgaris fruit. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity increased in FeSO4-induced brain damage. In contrast, flavonoid-rich extracts of B. vulgaris fruit protected against Fe2+-mediated brain damage by suppressing MAO activity in a concentration-dependent manner. HPLC-DAD profiling of the extracts identified quercetrin, apigenin, rutin, myricetin, iso-quercetrin, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and gallic acid. Molecular docking studies revealed quercetrin, apigenin, rutin, iso-queretrin, and myricetin were the top docked bioactive flavonoids against the five top target proteins (α-amylase, α-glucosidase AchE, BchE, and MAO). Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the complexes formed remained stable over the course of the simulation. Collectively, the findings support the prospect of flavonoid-rich extracts of B. vulgaris root functioning as a dual therapy for T2D and AD."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Low-glycemic diets are crucial, particularly for individuals with diet-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Therefore, observing the impact of multiple forms of red beetroot-based products on the glycemic profiles of humans under various health conditions has arguably become significant due to beetroot's high fiber content, antioxidants, inorganic nitrates, etc., which this review aims to summarize. RECENT FINDINGS: The relevant articles published between 2000 and 2022 were obtained from PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect by following the PRISMA-P 2020 statement. This systematic review included 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one non-randomized clinical trial (non-RCT), and one quasi-experimental (QE) study, and they covered different health conditions, e.g., type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, hypertension, etc. The studies produced conflicting results, likely due to differences in the study design, dosage, duration, and population. The risk of bias in most of the RCTs and QE studies included in the review was assessed as low or moderate, and only one non-RCT was assessed as having a high risk of bias. Red beetroot may help maintain the blood sugar levels of humans under different health conditions. However, the existing results on beetroot's potential for glycemic management are unclear due to varied outcomes across studies. Further intervention studies with standardized protocols and diverse participant groups are necessary to assess the role of beetroot products in regulating blood sugar levels before making a definitive judgment.",

      "abstract": "Betalain is a water-soluble pigment contained in Caryophyllales plants. It not only holds potential as a natural food colorant but also offers various health benefits, acting as an antioxidant. This study focused on analyzing the pH-dependent stability of encapsulated betalain pigments extracted from red beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) using methods such as absorption spectroscopy, HPLC, and LC-MS. The major pigments identified were vulgaxanthin I, betanin, isobetanin, and neobetanin, alongside minor components, including three betaxanthin species and a degradation product known as betalamic acid. Spectrophotometric analyses revealed that above pH 8, the betalain peak at 435 nm decreased and red-shifted to a peak at 549 nm, a shift that could be reversed through neutral pH treatment. At pH 11, a new broad peak appeared at 410 nm and was identified as betalamic acid. To assess the pH-dependency of each betalain, the targeted betalains were separated and quantified through HPLC after incubation across a wide pH range of 2-11 and during storage. After 3 days of storage in highly alkaline conditions (pH 10-11), major betalains, with the exception of neobetanin, underwent significant degradation. Conversely, these pigments displayed relative stability in acidic conditions. In contrast, neobetanin showed vulnerability to acidic conditions but exhibited tolerance to alkaline pH levels of 10-11. The degradation product, betalamic acid, demonstrated a similar susceptibility to alkaline pH as betanins. In conclusion, the significant stability decrease under highly alkaline conditions results not only from the hydrolytic reaction of betalains but also from the degradation of betalamic acid itself. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Encapsulation methods are used to enhance the stability of betalains against temperature variations; however, the effects of pH, especially when considering individual betalain species, are not well understood. Despite betalains exhibiting similar features and being suitable for a wide pH range from acid to alkaline conditions, they are significantly affected by alkaline pH levels exceeding 10, as well as by storage duration. This study demonstrated the application of encapsulation to pH-dependent stability, and the findings offer valuable insights and a fresh perspective on betalains as red biocolorants, extending their potential application to a wide range of pH-controlled food products.",

      "abstract": "The decline in vascular function and increase in blood pressure with aging contribute to an increased cardiovascular disease risk. In this randomized placebo-controlled crossover study, we evaluated whether previously reported cardiovascular benefits of plant-derived inorganic nitrate via nitric oxide (NO) translate into improved vascular function and blood pressure-lowering in 15 men and women (age range: 56-71 years) with treated hypertension. We investigated the effects of a single ∼400 mg-dose at 3 hours post-ingestion (3H POST) and the daily consumption of 2 × ∼400 mg of nitrate through nitrate-rich compared with nitrate-depleted (placebo) beetroot juice over 4 weeks (4WK POST). Measurements included nitrate and nitrite in plasma and saliva; endothelial-dependent and -independent forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to acetylcholine (FBFACh) and glyceryltrinitrate (FBFGTN); and clinic-, home- and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. Compared to placebo, plasma and salivary nitrate and nitrite increased at 3H and 4WK POST following nitrate treatment (P < 0.01), suggesting a functioning nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway in the participants of this study. There were no differences between treatments in FBFACh and FBFGTN-area under the curve (AUC) ratios [AUC ratios after (3H POST, 4WK POST) compared with before (PRE) the intervention], or 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure or home blood pressure measures (P > 0.05). These findings do not support the hypothesis that an increased intake of dietary nitrate exerts sustained beneficial effects on FBF or blood pressure in hypertensive older adults, providing important information on the efficacy of nitrate-based interventions for healthy vascular aging. This study was registered under ClinicialTrials.gov (NCT04584372).",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease associated with several complications, including that of kidney disease. Plant-based dietary products have shown promise in mitigating these effects to improve kidney function and prevent tissue damage. This study assessed the possible favorable effects of beetroot extract (BE) in improving kidney function and preventing tissue damage in diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was induced using a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ). Both control and rats with pre-established T2DM were divided into six groups (each consisting of eight rats). All treatments were given by gavage and continued for 12 weeks. Fasting blood glucose levels, serum fasting insulin levels, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), serum triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, serum and urinary albumin, and creatinine and urea levels were measured. Apart from this, glutathione, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukine-6 in the kidney homogenates of all groups of rats were measured, and the histopathological evaluation of the kidney was also performed. Results: It was observed that treatment with BE increased body weight significantly (p ≤ 0.05) to be similar to that of control groups. Fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR levels, and lipid profile in the plasma of the pre-established T2DM rats groups decreased to p ≤ 0.05 in the BE-treated rats as the BE concentration increased. Treatment with BE also improved the renal levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, urinary albumin, and serum creatinine and urea levels. Unlike all other groups, only the kidney tissues of the T2DM + BE (500 mg/kg) rats group showed normal kidney tissue structure, which appears to be similar to those found in the kidney tissues of the control rats groups. Conclusion: we found that streptozotocin administration disturbed markers of kidney dysfunction. However, Beta vulgaris L. root extract reversed these changes through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic mechanisms.",

The novel BR@CS NC was applied to human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), human epithelial ductal breast carcinoma (T-47D), and human epithelial lung carcinoma (A549) cells. SEM characterization of CS NP revealed a variety of particle shapes ranging from 20 to 58 nm in diameter. UV-VIS analysis confirmed the formation of the BR@CS NC, while FTIR analysis demonstrated strong hydrogen bonds between CS NP and BR. These bonds reduced the positive surface charge of CS NP, as indicated by zeta potential analysis. When applied to cancer cell lines at a concentration of 250 μg/mL, the BR@CS NC successfully eradicated 89 % of A549, 88 % of T-47D, and 83 % of Caco-2 cell lines. The cell death mode exhibited extensive, apoptotic, and massive necrotic changes in all cell lines treated with BR@CS NC. Caspase 3 (CasP3) and P53 levels were elevated in BR@CS NC-treated cells. This study merges BR's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties with the antiangiogenic mechanism and inhibition of tumors by CS NP, resulting in a unique and innovative strategy for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "A low carbohydrate, high fat (LCHF) diet in athletes increases fat oxidation but impairs sports performance, potentially due to impaired exercise economy. Dietary nitrate supplementation can improve exercise economy via an increase in nitric oxide production, which is initiated by the reduction of nitrate to nitrite within the oral cavity. This reaction is dependent on the presence of nitrate-reducing oral bacteria, which can potentially be altered by dietary changes, including a LCHF diet. This study explored the effect of a LCHF diet on the oral microbiome and subsequent changes to plasma nitrite concentration following nitrate supplementation. Following five days of LCHF or high carbohydrate (HCHO) control dietary intervention, highly trained male race walkers consumed 140 mL beetroot juice containing 8.4 mmol nitrate; they then provided (a) blood samples for plasma nitrate and nitrite analysis and (b) saliva samples for 16S rRNA sequencing of the oral microbiome. The LCHF diet (n = 13) reduced oral bacterial diversity and changed the relative abundance of the genera Neisseria (+10%), Fusobacteria (+3%), Prevotella (-9%), and Veillonella (-4%), with no significant changes observed following the HCHO diet (n = 11). Following beetroot juice ingestion, plasma nitrite concentrations were higher for the LCHF diet compared to the HCHO diet (p = 0.04). However, the absence of an interaction with the trial (pre-post) (p = 0.71) suggests that this difference was not due to the dietary intervention. In summary, we found an increase in plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations in response to nitrate supplementation independent of diet. This suggests the oral microbiome is adaptive to dietary changes and can maintain a nitrate reduction capacity despite a decrease in bacterial diversity following the LCHF diet.",

      "abstract": "Fat browning, which converts white adipose tissue to brown, has attracted attention as a promising strategy for the treatment of obesity. Betanin (BT) has been reported to have potential anti-obesity activity. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated for 7 days during BT treatment. The BT concentration range for the study was determined using an MTT assay, and lipid accumulation was evaluated by Oil-Red-O staining. The expression of protein level was analyzed by Western blot. Immunofluorescence images were performed with confocal microscopy to visually show the amount and location of thermogenesis factor uncoupling protein1 (UCP1) and mitochondria. qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate mRNA expression. BT inhibited lipid accumulation and increased the expression of UCP1, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and PPARγ coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α). In addition, the increases in beige adipocyte-specific markers were observed, supporting BT-mediated browning of the fat tissue. The UCP1 was localized in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and its expression was associated with mitochondrial activation. Consistent with this, the mRNA expression of mitochondrial biogenesis markers increased in 3T3-L1 cells after BT treatment. Immunofluorescence staining also indicated an increased number of mitochondria and UCP1, respectively. Moreover, BT inhibited lipogenesis and enhanced lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. This mechanism has been suggested to be mediated by an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. BT induces fat browning and regulates lipid metabolism via the AMPK-mediated pathway in 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that BT can be a promising candidate for controlling obesity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The increase in blood pressure (BP) levels in the postmenopausal period can be partly explained by the decrease in nitric oxide synthases (NOS). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acute and one-week effects of beetroot juice nitrate-rich (BRJ-NO3-rich) ingestion on cardiovascular and autonomic performance in response to submaximal aerobic exercise in postmenopausal women with systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) who are physically inactive. METHODS: Fourteen postmenopausal women with SAH [mean (SD) age: 59(4) y; BMI (kg/m2): 29.2(3.1)] completed submaximal aerobic exercise bouts after an acute and a one-week intervention with BRJ in a placebo-controlled, randomized, triple-blind, crossover design. Participants ingested either BRJ (800 mg of NO3-) or placebo acutely and drank either BRJ (400 mg of NO3-) or placebo every day for the next six days. After two and ½ hours, they performed a session of aerobic submaximal aerobic exercise, and their systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), flow-mediated dilation (FMD), heart rate (HR) recovery, and HR variability were measured. RESULTS: In the post-exercise recovery period, SBP dropped significantly in the BRJ-NO3-rich group (-9.28 mmHg [95%CI: -1.68 to -16.88] ES: -0.65, p = 0.019) compared to placebo after acute ingestion. The FMD values increased after acute BRJ-NO3-rich on post-exercise (3.18 % [0.36 to 5.99] ES: 0.87, p = 0.031). After the one-week intervention, FMD values were higher in the BRJ-NO3-rich group before (4.5 % [1.62 to 7.37] ES: 1.21, p = 0.005) and post-exercise measurements (4.2 % [1.52 to 6.87] ES: 1.22, p = 0.004) vs. placebo. HRV indices with remarkable parasympathetic modulation to heart recovered faster on the BRJ-NO3-rich group than placebo group. No between-group differences were identified in values of HR post-exercise recovery in the 30s, 60s, 120s, 180s, and 300s. CONCLUSIONS: Acute and short-term BRJ-NO3-rich ingestion may enhance cardiovascular and autonomic behavior in response to aerobic exercise in postmenopausal women diagnosed with SAH.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of athletes using ergogenic aids. In this context, scientific evidence must play a prominent role in either endorsing or warning against the use of these products, ensuring the preservation of health while promoting the theoretically established positive benefits. In this vein, beetroot juice (BJ) stands out as a key supplement as an ergogenic aid to improve sports performance, given its demonstrated influence on both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. However, despite widespread global demand, there remains a lack of understanding regarding the potential synergistic effects of combining BJ with other supplements. Consequently, our study aims to determine whether the combination of BJ with another nutritional supplement can enhance its beneficial effects and, therefore, optimize physical performance in humans. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in two major databases-Web of Science and PubMed-from 1 January 2018 to 29 January 2023, using specific keywords. After the exclusion criteria, six articles were selected for analysis. Therefore, our study shows that the effectiveness of combining BJ with another supplement mainly depends on the duration of the chronic intervention, which is where the greatest benefits have been observed.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity and possible mechanisms of beetroot (Beta vulgaris) extract against S. Typhimurium, as well as the application potential in cooked pork. The results suggested beetroot extract could inhibit S. Typhimurium with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 20 mg/mL. After treatment with beetroot extract (1 or 2 MIC), S. Typhimurium exhibited the characteristics of apoptotic-like death (ALD), such as membrane depolarization, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, caspase-like protein activation, and DNA fragmentation. Further research has shown that the ALD induced by beetroot extract in S. Typhimurium was caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) consumption, which was different from most natural products. The treatment of cooked pork with beetroot extract could reduce the number of S. Typhimurium, lower pH, defer lipid oxidation, and improve the colour. These results indicate that beetroot extract can inhibit S. Typhimurium through the ALD mechanism and has potential as an antibacterial agent against S. Typhimurium in ready-to-eat meat products.",

This study aimed to determine the profile and content of PFASs in the volunteers' blood plasma and urine after the consumption of fermented red beetroot juice and then correlated it with the blood parameters. Over 42 days, 24 healthy volunteers ingested 200 mL/60 kg of body weight of fermented red beetroot juice. PFASs were analyzed using the micro-HPLC-MS/MS method. Five perfluoroalkyl substances were found in the volunteers' body fluids. After consuming the juice, it was discovered that regarding the perfluorocarboxylic acids, a downward trend was observed, while regarding the perfluoroalkane sulfonates, and their plasma content showed a statistically significant upward trend. Analysis of the hematology parameters indicated that the intake of fermented red beetroot juice showed a significant decrease in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets concentration, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR) at the significance level p < 0.01, and hematocrit (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the dietary intervention also indicated a significant (p < 0.01) increase in corpuscular/cellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). In the case of blood biochemistry, no significant change was observed in the blood samples after the intake of the fermented beetroot juice. However, a decreasing tendency of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentration (LDL-C) was observed.

Blood pressure (BP) was measured at home daily. Cardiac output ( CO ) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were assessed via bio-impedance. RESULTS: Twenty-nine out of 32 (91%) participants completed the study. Adherence to daily BP and weight measurements were 81% and 78%, respectively ( n  = 29). Eight out of 15 (53%) of participants did not drink all the provided beetroot juice because of forgetfulness and taste. After 12 weeks, exercise was associated with a reduction in standing TPR (-278 ± 0.272 dynes s cm -5 , P  < 0.05), and an increase in standing CO (+0.88 ± 0.71 l/min, P  < 0.05). Exercise and beetroot juice together was associated with a reduction in standing DBP ( 7 ± 6 mmHg, P  < 0.05), and an increase in standing CO (+0.49 ± 0.66 l/min, P  < 0.05). The control group showed a reduction in standing TPR ( 313 ± 387 dynes s cm -5 ) and standing DBP ( 8 ± 5mmHg). All groups gained weight. CONCLUSION: Exercise and beetroot juice in combination showed a signal towards improving cardiovascular parameters. The control group showed improvements, indicating that home measurement devices and regular recording of parameters are interventions in themselves. Nevertheless, interventions before pregnancy to improve cardiovascular parameters may alter the occurrence of hypertensive conditions during pregnancy and require further investigation in adequately powered studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In both developed and developing countries, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has lately risen to the top of the list of chronic liver illnesses. Although there is no permanent cure, early management, diagnosis, and treatment might lessen its effects. The purpose of conducting the current study is to compare the effects of beetroot juice and the Mediterranean diet on the lipid profile, level of liver enzymes, and liver sonography in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 180 people with a mean age of (45.19 ± 14.94) years participated. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 73. The mean weight before intervention was (82.46 ± 5.97) kg, while the mean weight after intervention was roughly (77.88 ± 6.26) kg. The trial lasted for 12 weeks. The participants were split into four groups: control, a Mediterranean diet with beet juice (BJ + MeD), Mediterranean diet alone (MeD), and beetroot juice (BJ). The Mediterranean diet included fruits, vegetables, fish, poultry, and other lean meats (without skin), sources of omega-3 fatty acids, nuts, and legumes. Beetroot juice had 250 mg of beetroot. Data analysis was done using SPSS software (version 26.0). p < 0.05 is the statistical significance level. RESULTS: Following the intervention, Serum Bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), serum cholesterol (CHOL), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were significantly decreased in the BJ + MeD, BJ, and MeD groups (p = 0.001). Also, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) significantly increased in the BJ + MeD, BJ, and MeD groups (p = 0.001), while decreasing in the Control group (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The research findings indicate a significant reduction in hepatic steatosis among the groups receiving beetroot juice (BJ) and beetroot juice combined with the Mediterranean diet (BJ + MeD). This suggests that beetroot juice holds potential as an effective treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adults. Furthermore, the combination of beetroot juice with the Mediterranean diet showed enhanced efficacy in addressing NAFLD.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT05909631."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) impaired nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, in part, contributes to early-onset hypertension. Beetroot juice (BRJ) reduces blood pressure (BP) by increasing NO-mediated vasodilation. The aim of this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study is to test the hypothesis that BRJ reduces systolic and diastolic clinic BP in hypertensive adults with ADPKD. METHODS: Participants with ADPKD and treated hypertension (n = 60) will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive a daily dose of either nitrate-replete (400 mg nitrate/day) or nitrate-deplete BRJ for 4 weeks. The co-primary outcomes are change in mean systolic and diastolic clinic BP before and after 4 weeks of treatment with daily BRJ. Secondary outcomes are changes in daily home BP, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, serum and salivary nitrate/nitrite levels and serum asymmetric dimethylarginine levels before and after 4 weeks of BRJ. DISCUSSION: The effect of BRJ in ADPKD has not been previously tested. BRJ is an accessible, natural dietary supplement that, if effective, will provide a novel adjunctive approach for treating hypertension in ADPKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05401409.

However, athletes often receive rigorous exercise without being supported by proper nutrition which can lead to oxidative stress. It is necessary to maintain performance by supplementing beetroot juice which contains betalains and inorganic nitrates so that oxidative stress can be controlled. This research is aimed to determine the effect of beetroot juice on the ṼO2max of soccer athletes. By using true experimental with randomized pre-test post-test control group design, 16 healthy males aged 16-19 years old were divided into two groups, treatment, and control. Data were analyzed by independent sample t-test and paired t-test. There is a significant difference in weight and body mass index (p<0.05). There is no significant difference in age, height, pre-body fat, post-body fat, Δbody fat, nutrition intake, school hours, sleep hours, and physical exercise as well as ṼO2max before and after intervention (p>0.05). There is a significant difference in ṼO2max change in both groups (p<0.05). Thus, both beetroot juice and placebo significantly affected the increase of ṼO2max levels in soccer athletes."

      "abstract": "Population explosions, environmental deprivation, and industrial expansion led to an imbalanced agricultural system. Non-judicial uses of agrochemicals have decreased agrodiversity, degraded agroecosystems, and increased the cost of farming. In this scenario, a sustainable agriculture system could play a crucial role; however, it needs rigorous study to understand the biological interfaces within agroecosystems. Among the various biological components with respect to agriculture, mycorrhizae could be a potential candidate. Most agricultural crops are symbiotic with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). In this study, beetroot has been chose to study the effect of different AMFs on various parameters such as morphological traits, biochemical attributes, and gene expression analysis (ALDH7B4 and ALDH3I1). The AMF Gm-Funneliformis mosseae (Glomus mosseae), Acaulospora laevis, and GG-Gigaspora gigantean were taken as treatments to study the effect on the above-mentioned parameters in beetroot. We observed that among all the possible combinations of mycorrhizae, Gm+Al+GG performed best, and the Al-alone treatment was found to be a poor performer with respect to all the studied parameters. This study concluded that the more the combinations of mycorrhizae, the better the results will be. However, the phenomenon depends on the receptivity, infectivity, and past nutrient profile of the soil."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To prove the hypothesis that beetroot, watermelon and ginger juice supplementation improves the endometrial receptivity and clinical outcomes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. METHODS: This prospective randomized study enrolled 436 female patients undergoing ICSI cycles from January/2018 to June/2021, in a private university-affiliated IVF center. Female patients were randomized in a 1:3 ratio to either Control (n=109) or Supplementation Group (n=327). All patients received nutritional orientation before the beginning of the treatment. Participants in the Supplementation Group were instructed to intake a daily dose of homemade juice, prepared with fresh beetroot, watermelon and ginger, from the day of embryo transfer until the day of pregnancy test, while patients in Control Group did not follow the juice protocol. Generalized Linear Models, adjusted for potential confounders (female age, body mass index - BMI, endometrial thickness upon embryo transfer, and number of transferred embryos), followed by Bonferroni post hoc test for the comparison of means between groups, were used to investigate the impact of juice supplementation on the clinical outcomes of ICSI. RESULTS: Patients and cycles characteristics were equally distributed among Supplementation and Control groups. Implantation rate (25.2% vs. 20.5%, p<0.001) and clinical pregnancy rate (41.0% vs. 22.0%, p=0.039) were significantly higher in the Supplementation compared to the Control group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of beetroot, watermelon and ginger juice may be considered a promising strategy for improving clinical outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART), without any side effects.",

      "abstract": "Betanin is a red pigment of red beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.), providing the beneficial effects to maintain human health. Betanin is involved in the characteristic red color of red beetroot, and used as an edible dye. Betanin is known to be a highly unstable pigment, and water solutions of betanin are nearly fully degraded after heating at 99°C for 60 min in the experimental conditions of this study. The present study investigated the effects of red beetroot juice (RBJ) and betanin on immune cells, and found that stimulation with RBJ and betanin induces interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, and IL-10 mRNA in a human monocyte derived cell line, THP-1 cells. This mRNA induction after stimulation with RBJ and betanin was not significantly changed after heat treatment when attempting to induce degradation of the betanin. Following these results, the effects of heat degradation of betanin on the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW264 cells and the antioxidant capacity were investigated. The results showed that the inhibition activity of RBJ and betanin with the LPS induced NO production is not altered after heat degradation of betanin. In addition, the results of FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) and DPPH (1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assays indicate that a not inconsiderable degree of the antioxidant capacity of RBJ and betanin remained after heat degradation of betanin. These results suggest that it is important to consider the effects of degradation products of betanin in the evaluation of the beneficial effects of red beetroot on health.",

One potential contributor to Black adult's higher BP may be reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Therefore, we sought to determine whether augmenting NO bioavailability with acute beetroot juice (BRJ) supplementation would reduce resting BP and cardiovascular reactivity in Black and White adults, but to a greater extent in Black adults. A total of 18 Black and 20 White (∼equal split by biological sex) young adults completed this randomized, placebo-controlled (nitrate (NO3-)-depleted BRJ), crossover design study. We measured heart rate, brachial and central BP, and arterial stiffness (via pulse wave velocity) at rest, during handgrip exercise, and during post-exercise circulatory occlusion. Compared with White adults, Black adults exhibited higher pre-supplementation resting brachial and central BP (Ps ≤0.035; e.g., brachial systolic BP: 116(11) vs. 121(7) mmHg, P = 0.023). Compared with placebo, BRJ (∼12.8 mmol NO3-) reduced resting brachial systolic BP similarly in Black (Δ-4±10 mmHg) and White (Δ-4±7 mmHg) adults (P = 0.029). However, BRJ supplementation reduced BP in males (Ps ≤ 0.020) but not females (Ps ≥ 0.299). Irrespective of race or sex, increases in plasma NO3- were associated with reduced brachial systolic BP (ρ = -0.237, P = 0.042). No other treatment effects were observed for BP or arterial stiffness at rest or during physical stress (i.e., reactivity); Ps ≥ 0.075. Despite young Black adults having higher resting BP, acute BRJ supplementation reduced systolic BP in young Black and White adults by a similar magnitude, an effect that was driven by males.",

Our results showed that the MIC of beetroot extract against C. sakazakii was 25 mg/mL and C. sakazakii (approximately 8 log cfu/mL) was completely inhibited after treatment with 2 MIC of beetroot extract for 3 h. Beetroot extract reduced intracellular ATP levels and facilitated characteristics of ALD in C. sakazakii, such as membrane depolarization, increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-like protein activation, and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, and different from most bacterial ALD caused by the accumulation of ROS, beetroot extract reduced the intracellular ROS levels in C. sakazakii. Our experimental data provide a rationale for further research of bacterial ALD and demonstrate that beetroot extract can inhibit C. sakazakii in food processing environments.",

This pilot study investigates the combined effects of CR and nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BRJ) on metabolic, vascular, and cognitive functions in overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults. This was a two-arm, parallel randomized clinical trial including 29 participants allocated to CR + BRJ (n = 15) or CR alone (n = 14) for 14 days. Body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), and hand-grip strength were measured. Resting blood pressure (BP) and microvascular endothelial function were measured, and Trail-Making Test A and B were used to assess cognitive function. Salivary nitrate and nitrite, and urinary nitrate and 8-isoprostane concentrations were measured. Changes in body composition, REE, and systolic and diastolic BP were similar between the two interventions (p > 0.05). The CR + BRJ intervention produced greater changes in average microvascular flux (p = 0.03), NO-dependent endothelial activity (p = 0.02), and TMT-B cognitive scores (p = 0.012) compared to CR alone. Changes in urinary 8-isoprostane were greater in the CR + BRJ group (p = 0.02), and they were inversely associated with changes in average microvascular flux (r = -0.53, p = 0.003). These preliminary findings suggest that greater effects on vascular and cognitive functions could be achieved by combining CR with dietary nitrate supplementation.",

In the current study, we analysed the effects of beetroot on parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism in two models of metabolic syndrome: (i) transgenic spontaneously hypertensive rats expressing human C-reactive protein (SHR-CRP rats), and (ii) hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (HHTg) rats. Treatment with beetroot juice for 4 weeks was, in both models, associated with amelioration of oxidative stress, reduced circulating lipids, smaller visceral fat depots, and lower ectopic fat accumulation in the liver compared to the respective untreated controls. On the other hand, beetroot treatment had no significant effects on the sensitivity of the muscle and adipose tissue to insulin action in either model. Analyses of hepatic proteome revealed significantly deregulated proteins involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, mTOR signalling, inflammation, and cytoskeleton rearrangement."

      "abstract": "With very little research exploring intestinal effects of red beetroot consumption, the present pilot study investigated gut microbial changes following red beetroot consumption, via a 14-day intervention trial in healthy adults. Compared to baseline, the study demonstrates transient changes in abundance of some taxa e.g., Romboutsia and Christensenella, after different days of intervention (p < 0.05). Enrichment of Akkermansia muciniphila and decrease of Bacteroides fragilis (p < 0.05) were observed after 3 days of juice consumption, followed by restoration in abundance after 14 days. With native betacyanins and catabolites detected in stool after juice consumption, betacyanins were found to correlate positively with Bifidobacterium and Coprococcus, and inversely with Ruminococcus (p < 0.1), potentiating a significant rise in (iso)butyric acid content (172.7 ± 30.9 µmol/g stool). Study findings indicate the potential of red beetroot to influence gut microbial populations and catabolites associated with these changes, emphasizing the potential benefit of red beetroot on intestinal as well as systemic health.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to study the feasibility of using electro-activation as a nonthermal treatment to produce stable beetroot juice. Specifically, red beetroot juice was electro-activated under two different reactor configurations by using three electric current intensities (100, 200, and 300 mA) during 120 min. Different parameters of the juice were measured such as the pH, redox potential, juice titratable acidity, Brix degree and total dry matter, color, betalain and polyphenolic contents, and antioxidant capacity of the electro-activated juice. By using the reactor Configuration A in which the targeted juice was electro-activated in the anodic compartment of the used reactor, acidic juice with pH 4 and 5 as well as a redox potential close to +300 mV was obtained. The Brix degree, color, dry matter, and phenolic content were not significantly influenced by this electro-activation. However, the treatment permitted increasing the antioxidant capacity of the juice as measured by the DPPH and ABTS assays. By using the reactor Configuration B in which the targeted beet juice was electro-activated in the cathodic compartment of the used compartment, a juice with an alkaline pH of approximately pH 9 and a reducing redox potential of -697 mV was obtained. With this reactor configuration, the Brix degree and total dry matter were not affected, but the color and total polyphenolic content changed. The betalains and polyphenolic compounds were degraded under the alkaline conditions of this electro-activation treatment, which had a negative consequence on the juice quality by decreasing its antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that anodic electro-activation of a beet juice can be technologically feasible since this treatment permitted producing stable juice as well as maintaining the main physico-chemical properties of the juice, enhancing its antioxidant capacity, and keeping the juice color at high level."

The impact of increased nitrate intake on soluble inflammatory mediators in individuals with hypertension is unclear. We assessed whether the daily consumption of dietary nitrate via beetroot juice for 1-week lowered levels of circulating inflammatory markers in men and women with treated hypertension. Twenty-seven male and female participants were recruited to a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial. The effects of 1-week intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice versus 1-week intake of nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (placebo) were investigated. Plasma concentrations of circulating soluble adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CD62E, CD62P), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, TNF-α) and chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1) were measured by multiplex flow cytometric bead array in samples collected on day 7 of each intervention period. Other outcomes included alterations in nitrate metabolism assessed by measuring nitrate and nitrite concentrations in plasma, saliva, and urine. One week of beetroot juice did not alter levels of the soluble adhesion markers or cytokines assessed. A 7-fold increase in salivary nitrite, an 8-fold increase in salivary nitrate, a 3-fold increase in plasma nitrate and nitrite, and a 4-fold increase in urinary nitrate and nitrite compared to the placebo was observed (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Increasing dietary nitrate consumption over 7 days is not effective in reducing soluble inflammatory mediators in individuals with treated hypertension. This trial was registered at anzctr.org.au as ACTRN 12613000116729.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are both major underlying factors for the initiation and progression of diabetes, as well as for the development of long-term diabetes-related consequences in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study was designed to evaluate the effects of beetroot juice (BJ) consumption on oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in patients with T2DM. In this trial, 52 patients with T2DM were randomly assigned to either the concentrated BJ or the control group. The BJ group received 12 ml concentrated BJ twice daily, whereas the control group received no intervention. At the baseline and the end of week 12, plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were measured. Compared with the control group, BJ reduced IL-6 (-0.1 vs. 0.83, P = 0.001), TNF-α (-1.28 vs. 5.51, P = 0.001), and NF-κB (-0.03 vs. 0.36, P = 0.005) after 12-week intervention; plasma concentration of MDA and hs-CRP did not change between groups after intervention. Intra-group comparison disclosed that daily BJ consumption could not change oxidative stress and inflammatory markers except for TNF-α (-1.28 ± 2.31, P = 0.026) compared with the baseline. However, the concentrations of IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-κB increased significantly in the control group at the end of week 12 compared to baseline (19.5%, P = 0.001; 120%, P = 0.001; and 69%, P = 0.021, respectively). In conclusion, our study indicates that daily consumption of BJ reduces the concentrations of some inflammatory markers, including IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-κB, which are involved in the pathogenesis of complications of T2DM. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Beetroot juice concentrate contains nutrients such as antioxidants that can improve the health status of people with type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is growing worldwide, dietary intake plays a remarkable role in the management of disease complications. Evidence suggests that beetroot has health-promoting potentials, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antidiabetic properties. Therefore, the present clinical trial aimed to investigate the effects of concentrated beetroot juice (BJ) supplementation on anthropometric measures, glycemic control, blood pressure (BP), and lipid profile in T2D patients. METHODS: In the simply randomized, parallel-group, controlled, and open-label trial, forty-six patients with T2D were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (BJ group), who consumed 24 ml concentrated BJ daily for 12 weeks, or the control group without any intervention. Anthropometric measurements, physical activity, dietary intakes, glycemic measures, lipid profile, and blood pressure were assessed at the baseline and the end of the study. RESULTS: Plasma nitric oxide (NO) in the intervention group had a higher nonsignificant increase after 12 weeks compared with the control group (8.57 ± 23.93 vs. 2.31 ± 15.98, P = 0.128). Compared with the baseline, significant reductions in plasma insulin (14.55 ± 7.85 vs. 10.62 ± 6.96, P = 0.014) and homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B) (3.96 ± 0.83 vs. 3.63 ± 0.75, P = 0.038), as well as a marginally significant reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (70.81 ± 11.24 vs. 65.44 ± 6.46, P = 0.058) were observed in the control group after 12 weeks. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was significantly reduced in the BJ group compared with the baseline (74.73 ± 16.78 vs. 72.36 ± 16.09, P = 0.046). After adjusting for baseline values, no significant effect on the levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c), HOMA-β, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), HDL, triglycerides (TG), and blood pressure (BP) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that daily consumption of 24 ml concentrated BJ did not affect the levels of glycemic measures, blood pressure, and lipid profile. More studies are necessary to confirm these findings.

      "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) contributes to maintaining normal cardiovascular and renal function. This bioactive signalling molecule is generally formed enzymatically by NO synthase in the vascular endothelium. NO bioactivity can also be attributed to dietary intake of inorganic nitrate, which is abundant in our diet, especially in green leafy vegetables and beets. Ingested nitrate is reduced to nitrite by oral commensal bacteria and further to NO systemically. Previous studies have shown that dialysis, by means of removing nitrate and nitrite from the body, can reduce NO bioactivity. Hence, dietary intervention approaches aimed to boost the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway may be of benefit in dialysis patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the kinetics of plasma nitrate and nitrite after a single intake of nitrate-rich concentrated beetroot juice (BJ) in adult hemodialysis (HD) patients and in age-matched healthy volunteers (HV). Eight HD patients and seven HV participated in this single center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Each participant received a sequential single administration of active BJ (70 mL, 400 mg nitrate) and placebo BJ (70 mL, 0 mg nitrate) in a random order separated by a washout period of seven days. For the kinetic analysis, blood samples were collected at different time-points before and up to 44 h after BJ intake. Compared with placebo, active BJ significantly increased plasma nitrate and nitrite levels both in HD patients and HV. The area under the curve and the maximal concentration of plasma nitrate, but not of nitrite, were significantly higher in HD patients as compared with HV. In both groups, active BJ ingestion did not affect blood pressure or plasma potassium levels. Both BJs were well tolerated in all participants with no adverse events reported. Our data provide useful information in planning dietary nitrate supplementation efficacy studies in patients with reduced NO bioactivity.",

Cytotoxicity was studied by the MTT ([3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, for 24 h and 48 h. Simultaneous treatment and pre-treatment strategies were tested with 1:512-1:2 and 1:0 dilutions of BRE, with a concentration range from 0.4 to 100 μM of FB1 and from 0.19 to 50 μM of OTA. IC50 values of 5.8 μM and 9.1 μM at 24 h and 48 h, respectively were obtained for OTA while no cytotoxic effect was detected at the concentrations tested for FB1. Cytoprotection with increased viability was obtained when the simultaneous BRE + OTA strategy was performed. Finally, better protection was observed in the pretreatment strategy in which cells were exposed 24 h previously to BRE, compared to that shown in the simultaneous assay.",

Since various food components influence this pathway, the aim of this trial was to study the effect of beetroot juice alone and in conjunction with vitamin C or protein on the acute response to plasma nitrate and nitrite levels in healthy middle- to older-aged adults. In this cross-over trial, each participant received, in a randomized order, a single dose of Beet It Sport® alone; Beet It Sport®, plus a 200 mg vitamin C supplement; and Beet It Sport® plus 15 g of whey protein. Plasma levels of nitrate and nitrite were determined prior to and at 1 and 3 h after intervention. Log plasma nitrate and nitrite was calculated to obtain data that were normally distributed, and these data were analyzed using two-way within-factors ANOVA, with time and treatment as the independent factors. There were no statistically significant differences for log plasma nitrate (p = 0.308) or log plasma nitrite (p = 0.391) values across treatments. Log plasma nitrate increased significantly from pre-consumption levels after 1 h (p < 0.001) and 3 h (p < 0.001), but plasma nitrate was lower at 3 h than 1 h (p < 0.001). Log plasma nitrite increased from pre to 1 h (p < 0.001) and 3 h (p < 0.001) with log values at 3 h higher than at 1 h (p = 0.003). In this cohort, we observed no differences in log plasma nitrate and nitrite at 1 h and 3 h after co-ingesting beetroot juice with vitamin C or a whey protein supplement compared to beetroot juice alone. Further research needs to be undertaken to expand the blood-sampling time-frame and to examine factors that may influence the kinetics of the plasma nitrate to nitrite efficacy, such as differences in fluid volume and osmolarity between treatments employed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The impact of high-nitrate beetroot juice (BRJ) supplementation has seen a recent explosion of interest in sports science. This study examined the potential influence of 7-day BRJ supplementation on the endurance performance of winter triathletes. METHODS: Eighty young active winter triathletes (44 males, age = 21.50 ± 1.15 yrs; 36 females, age = 20.66 ± 1.45 yrs) participated in this study and were provided with either BRJ (6.5 mmol NO3-/70 mL) or a placebo (PL, 0.065 mmol NO3-/70 mL) for 7 days (a dose of ×3 per day) in a randomized, double-blind design. The athletes then completed a submaximal treadmill run, intraday cycling exhaustion testing, and a 10-km cross country (XC) skiing competition on the second day. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the oxygen uptake, respiratory exchange ratio, and blood lactic acid level (p < 0.05) between the BRJ and PL treatment groups during V3 speed running (males: 13.3 km·h-1, females: 11.6 km·h-1). BRJ treatment also remarkably increased the time to exhaustion (TTE) during cycling exhaustion testing (males: p = 0.02, females: p = 0.04). No significant differences were observed in medium- or low-speed submaximal treadmill runs and 10-km XC skiing performance. CONCLUSIONS: One week of daily nitrate-rich BRJ supplementation improved running economy at high speed during the submaximal treadmill running test and extended the TTE of athletes during cycling exhaustion testing. However, BRJ supplementation did not improve the performance in 10-km on-snow time trials in XC skiing. Regarding nutritional strategies to improve endurance performance in exercise training and competition, these results should be carefully considered owing to the different motor skill levels and competitive abilities of participants.",

This study aims to investigate the effect of red beetroot juice (RBJ) on carbohydrate metabolism in adult insulin-resistant rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen male Wistar rats (32 weeks old) were divided into two equal groups: control and RBJ. Treatment with drinking water (control) and 100% RBJ (RBJ) was lasted for 5 weeks. At the end of the 4th week the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed and at the end of the study period animals were sacrificed and blood and tissue (aorta, heart, and liver) samples were collected. Furthermore, pancreatic islets were isolated and their insulin secretion activity was investigated in different glycemic conditions. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, RBJ-treated rats showed lower blood glucose and insulin levels in the glucose tolerance test. Serum and tissue levels of nitric oxide in the RBJ group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The liver peroxidation and serum aspartate transaminase levels were significantly increased in the RBJ-treated animals compared to the control group. The islets of RBJ group exhibited lower insulin secretion, especially in 16.7 mM glucose concentration (supraphysiologic condition) than control group. CONCLUSIONS: RBJ consumption improves glucose metabolism in rats via increasing nitric oxide metabolites in an insulin-independent manner. However, future studies are needed to minimize the potential hepatic adverse consequences."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although there are a considerable number of clinical studies on nitrate (NO3) rich beetroot juice (BRJ) and hypertension, it is difficult to indicate the real effects of NO3 from BRJ on the BP of hypertensive patients because there are still no estimates of the effects of NO3 derived from BRJ on the BP of hypertension patients. OBJECTIVE: To clarify these effects, we developed a systematic literature review with a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). DESIGN: The searches were accomplished through EMBASE, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS databases. The study included single or double-blinded RCTs and participants older than 18 years with hypertension [systolic BP (SBP) > 130 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) > 80 mmHg]. NO3 BRJ was required to be consumed in a format that possibly blinded participants/researchers. These studies should also report the SBP and DBP values (mmHg) measured before and after the treatment. Risk of Bias tools and GRADE were enforced. RESULTS: Seven studies were included (218 participants). BRJ intervention time ranged from 3 to 60 days with daily dosages of 70-250 mL of BRJ. After the intervention with NO3 from BRJ, SBP underwent significant changes (p < 0.001) of -4.95 (95% CI: -8.88; -1.01) (GRADE: ⊕⊕⊕○ Moderate), but not for DBP (p = 0.06) -0.90 mmHg (95% CI: -3.16; 1.36) (GRADE: ⊕⊕⊕○ Moderate), compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The NO3 derived from BRJ reduces SBP, but not DBP in patients with arterial hypertension.

This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of BJ and CAF co-ingestion on team-sport-specific performance, compared with placebo (PL), BJ, and CAF alone. METHOD: Sixteen semi-professional male soccer players (age: 19.8 ± 2.2 years, body mass: 69.2 ± 6.1 kg, height: 177.3 ± 6.0 cm) completed four experimental trials using a randomized, double-blind study design: BJ + CAF, CAF + PL, BJ + PL, and PL + PL. Countermovement jump with arm swing (CMJAS) performance and cognitive function by Stroop Word-Color test were evaluated before and after the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1 (YYIR1). Also, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate, and gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort were measured during each session. RESULTS: No significant differences were shown between test conditions for total distance covered in YYIR1 (BJ + CAF: 1858 ± 455 m, CAF + PL: 1798 ± 422 m, BJ + PL: 1845 ± 408 m, PL + PL 1740 ± 362 m; p = 0.55). Moreover, CMJAS performance, cognitive function, and RPE during the YYIR1 were not significantly different among conditions (p > 0.05). However, the average heart rate during the YYIR1 was higher in CAF + PL compared to PL + PL (by 6 ± 9 beats/min; p < 0.05), and GI distress was greater in BJ + CAF compared to PL + PL (by 2.4 ± 3.6 a.u.; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest, neither acute co-ingestion of BJ + CAF nor BJ or CAF supplementation alone significantly affected team-sport-specific performance compared to the PL treatment."

The aim of the present report was to evaluate the effect of supplementation with nitric oxide precursors (l-arginine and beetroot extract) in muscular function during a training period of 6 weeks in elderly men and women. The study (double-blind, placebo-controlled) involved 66 subjects randomly divided into three groups: placebo, arginine-supplemented and beetroot extract-supplemented. At the end of this period, no changes in anthropometric parameters were observed. Regarding other circulating parameters, urea levels were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in women of the beetroot-supplemented group (31.6 ± 5.9 mg/dL) compared to placebo (41.3 ± 8.5 mg/dL) after 6 weeks of training. In addition, the circulating creatine kinase activity, as an index of muscle functionality, was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in women of the arginine- (214.1 ± 162.2 mIU/L) compared to the beetroot-supplemented group (84.4 ± 36.8 mIU/L) at the end of intervention. No significant effects were noticed with l-arginine or beetroot extract supplementation regarding strength, endurance and SPPB index. Only beetroot extract supplementation improved physical fitness significantly (p < 0.05) in the sprint exercise in men after 6 weeks (2.33 ± 0.59 s) compared to the baseline (2.72 ± 0.41 s). In conclusion, beetroot seems to be more efficient during short-term training while supplementing, preserving muscle functionality in women (decreased levels of circulating creatine kinase) and with modest effects in men."

      "abstract": "Dietary nitrate supplementation has shown promising ergogenic effects on endurance exercise. However, at present there is no systematic analysis evaluating the effects of acute or chronic nitrate supplementation on performance measures during high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and sprint interval training (SIT). The main aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the evidence for supplementation of dietary beetroot-a common source of nitrate-to improve peak and mean power output during HIIT and SIT. A systematic literature search was carried out following PRISMA guidelines and the PICOS framework within the following databases: PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and SPORTDiscus. Search terms used were: ((nitrate OR nitrite OR beetroot) AND (HIIT or high intensity or sprint interval or SIT) AND (performance)). A total of 17 studies were included and reviewed independently. Seven studies applied an acute supplementation strategy and ten studies applied chronic supplementation. The standardised mean difference for mean power output showed an overall trivial, non-significant effect in favour of placebo (Hedges' g = -0.05, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.21, Z = 0.39, p = 0.69). The standardised mean difference for peak power output showed a trivial, non-significant effect in favour of the beetroot juice intervention (Hedges' g = 0.08, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.30, Z = 0.72, p = 0.47). The present meta-analysis showed trivial statistical heterogeneity in power output, but the variation in the exercise protocols, nitrate dosage, type of beetroot products, supplementation strategy, and duration among studies restricted a firm conclusion of the effect of beetroot supplementation on HIIT performance. Our findings suggest that beetroot supplementation offers no significant improvement to peak or mean power output during HIIT or SIT. Future research could further examine the ergogenic potential by optimising the beetroot supplementation strategy in terms of dosage, timing, and type of beetroot product. The potential combined effect of other ingredients in the beetroot products should not be undermined. Finally, a chronic supplementation protocol with a higher beetroot dosage (>12.9 mmol/day for 6 days) is recommended for future HIIT and SIT study.",

This study aimed to assess the effect of lyophilized beet root powder at different doses on lipid profile and hyperlipidemia model. Albino rabbits weighing 1500-2000gms were taken for both studies. Beetroot powder was administered to animals at 500mg/kg and 1000mg/kg doses and after two month dosing the blood samples were withdrawn and lipid profile was assessed. Next a model of hyperlipidemia was created comprising of albino rabbits that were divided into five groups each containing n=6. Group I was considered as control, Group II was marked as Negative control, Group III was taken as standard, whereas Group IV and V were considered as treated and given different doses of beetroot. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, 45th day and at day 60th of study. Highly significant decrease in lipid profile (Cholesterol, LDL and TGS) and significant increase in HDL was observed by both doses after one month. HDL was increased more at 1000mg/kg dose. The presence of flavonoids and saponins in beetroot is responsible for hypolipidemic effect. From our research we came to the conclusion that beetroot powder reduced the lipid profile and could be beneficial in treatment of cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis and obesity.",

      "abstract": "The antioxidant capacity of polyphenols and flavonoids present in dietary agents aids in arresting the development of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting endothelial smooth muscle cells from oxidative stress/induced necrosis. Beetroot (Beta vulgaris&nbsp;var. rubra L.; BVr) is a commonly consumed vegetable representing a rich source of antioxidants. Beetroot peel's bioactive compounds and their role in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are still under-researched. In the present study, beetroot peel methanol extract (BPME) was prepared, and its effect on the bio-efficacy, nuclear integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential and vascular cell growth, and immunoregulation-related gene expression levels in HUVECs with induced oxidative stress were analysed. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) results confirmed that BPME contains 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (32.6%), methyl pyruvate (15.13%), furfural (9.98%), and 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-Pyran-4-one (12.4%). BPME extract effectively enhanced cell proliferation and was confirmed by MTT assay; the nuclear integrity was confirmed by propidium iodide (PI) staining assay; the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was confirmed by JC-1 staining assay. Annexin V assay confirmed that BPME-treated HUVECs showed 99% viable cells, but only 39.8% viability was shown in HUVECs treated with H2O2 alone. In addition, BPME treatment of HUVECs for 48 h reduced mRNA expression of lipid peroxide (LPO) and increased NOS-3, Nrf-2, GSK-3β, GPX, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular cell growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression levels. We found that BPME treatment decreased proinflammatory (nuclear factor-κβ (F-κβ), tissue necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) and vascular inflammation (intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), EDN1, IL-1β)-related mRNA expressions. In conclusion, beetroot peel treatment effectively increased vascular smooth cell growth factors and microtubule development, whereas it decreased vascular inflammatory regulators. BPME may be beneficial for vascular smooth cell regeneration, tissue repair and anti-ageing potential.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Beetroots have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may help attenuate inflammation and oxidative stress, enhancing recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of beetroot supplementation on oxidative stress, inflammation, and recovery after EIMD. DATA SOURCES: SPORTDiscus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched, and hand-searching was performed by looking to relevant studies that were cited in other studies. STUDY SELECTION: For a study to be included in this review, the following inclusion criteria had to be met: (1) research conducted with human participants, (2) original articles in peer-reviewed publications, (3) original studies that had investigated beetroot supplementation intervention on muscle damage and recovery, (4) research conducted with 1 control/placebo group, and (5) articles published from inception to October 2020. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3. DATA EXTRACTION: Two of the 4 authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the articles with the PEDro scale. All discrepancies were resolved through a consensus meeting. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies were included in this review. The methodological quality of the included studies ranged from moderate to high. Most of the studies found a better recovery of functional variables and muscle soreness, but improvements in markers of muscle damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress were not reported. CONCLUSION: The existing evidence suggests that a short-term beetroot supplementation has the potential to accelerate recovery of functional measures and muscle soreness, but further research is needed to clarify if a longer supplementation period (with some days before exercise and some days after) could also promote recovery of markers of muscle damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress.",

METHODS: In a quasi-experimental study, 44 type 2 diabetes patients (57 ± 4.5 years) consumed raw red beetroot (100 g, daily), for 8 weeks. Metabolic markers including body weight, glucose and lipid profile parameters, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, paraoxonase-1 activity, hepatic enzymes, blood pressure and cognitive function were measured at the beginning and end of 8 weeks. RESULTS: Raw red beetroot consumption resulted in a significant decrease in fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels (-13.53 mg/dL), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)(-0.34%), apolipoproteinB100 (ApoB100) (-8.25 mg/dl), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (-1.75 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (-3.7 U/L), homocysteine (-7.88 μmol/l), systolic (-0.73 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (-0.34 mmHg), anda significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (105 μmol/L) and cognitive function tests (all P values <0.05). Other variables did not change significantly after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Raw red beetroot consumption for 8 weeks in T2DM patients has beneficial impacts on cognitive function, glucose metabolism and other metabolic markers."

Due to a large amount of water, they are an unstable material. The aim of our research was to assess how the pretreatment method (thermal or nonthermal) affects the properties of powders obtained from beet juice and pomace after the freeze-drying process. The raw material was steamed or sonicated for 10 or 15 min, and then squeezed into juice and pomace. Both squeezed products were freeze-dried. The content of dry substance; L*, a*, and b* color parameters; and the content of betalain pigments were analyzed. Pretreatments increased the proportion of red and yellow in the juices. Steam and ultrasound caused a significant reduction in parameter b* in the dried pomace. A significant increase in betanin in lyophilizates was observed after pretreatment with ultrasound and steam for 15 min. As a result of all experiments, dried juices and pomaces can also be used as a colorant source. However, there is higher potential with pomaces due to their additional internal substances as well as better storage properties. After a few hours, juice was sticky and not ready to use.",

Medline and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from inception to June 2020. Inclusion criteria were studies in adult humans consuming inorganic nitrate before and after exercise and that measured markers implicated in the etiology of EIMD (muscle function, muscle soreness, inflammation, myocellular protein efflux, oxidative stress, range of motion) <168 h post. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias two tool was used to critically appraise the studies; forest plots were generated with random-effects models and standardized mean differences (SMD). Nine studies were included in the systematic review and six in the meta-analysis. All studies were rated to have some concerns for risk of bias. All trials in the meta-analysis provided nitrate as beetroot juice, which accelerated isometric strength recovery 72 h post-exercise (SMD: 0.54, p = 0.01) and countermovement jump performance 24-72 h post-exercise (SMD range: 0.75-1.32, p < 0.03). Pressure pain threshold was greater with beetroot juice 48 (SMD: 0.58, p = 0.03) and 72 h post-exercise (SMD: 0.61, p = 0.02). Beetroot juice had no effect on markers of oxidative stress and creatine kinase (p > 0.05), but c-reactive protein was higher vs. placebo at 48 h post-exercise (SMD: 0.55, p = 0.03). These findings suggest that nitrate-rich beetroot juice may attenuate some markers of EIMD, but more large-scale controlled trials in elite athletes are needed.",

Both cells presented the proliferation decreased for beetroot and beet leaves extracts. The apigenin treatment also reduced the proliferation of both cell lines. Regarding cell migration, beet leaves extract was able to decrease the scratch area in both cell lines, whereas apigenin affected only PC-3 cells' migration. In colony formation assay, both extracts were effective in reducing the number of colonies formed. Besides, the beet leaves extracts and apigenin presented strong inhibition of growth-related signaling pathways in both cell lines, and the beetroot extract and betanin presented effects only in DU-145 cells.

Beetroot is a promising vegetable because of its outstanding antioxidant activity, vivid colour, and content of bioactive compounds. In the present study, the quality of pure beetroot and apple juices as well as that of their mixture was evaluated by measuring changes of colour, betalain content, and antioxidant activity during processing and storage. No perceivable colour changes of the beetroot juice were observed after adding apple juice up to 85% of the total amount. However, the antioxidant activity was proportionally reduced with the addition of apple juice. Pasteurization negatively affected the content of betalains but did not influence the antioxidant activity. Storage led to colour modifications and reduction of betalains and antioxidant activity. Through preliminary shelf-life studies, a durability of 65 days at room temperature for apple and beetroot juice blends was calculated. The novelty of this study lies in an extended description of physico-chemical characteristics of a fresh apple and beetroot blended juice obtained from local products, in the study of the effects of processing and storage on its quality, and in the estimation of its shelf-life after storage at different temperatures."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain (NeP) medications have several side effects that affect NeP patients' quality of life. Betanin, the most common betacyanin pigment, has been shown to have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo; thus, it has potential as a healthcare treatment. In this study, we focused on betanin (red beetroot extract) as a potential therapy for NeP. METHODS: Mice model of NeP were made by chronic constriction injury (CCI), and the development of mechanical hypersensitivity was confirmed using the von Frey test. Motor coordination and locomotor activity were assessed using open field tests and rotarod tests, respectively. The expression level of glial markers in the spinal cords was analyzed by immunostaining. The direct effects of betanin on microglial cells were investigated using primary cultured microglial cells. RESULTS: In CCI model mice, repeated betanin treatment, both intraperitoneally and orally, attenuated developing mechanical hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner without impairing motor coordination. Betanin treatment also attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity that had developed and prevented the onset of mechanical hypersensitivity in CCI mice. Microglial activation in the spinal cord is known to play a key role in the development of NeP; betanin treatment reduced CCI-induced microglial activation in the spinal cord of model mice. Moreover, in primary microglia cultured cells, the activation of microglia by lipopolysaccharide application was suppressed by betanin treatment. CONCLUSION: Betanin treatment appears to ameliorate mechanical hypersensitivity related to CCI-induced NeP in mice by inhibiting microglial activation. SIGNIFICANCE: This article supports findings of the effect of betanin on NeP and provides a potential therapeutic candidate for NeP. Furthermore, elucidating the underlying mechanism of the effect of betanin on microglial activation could assist the development of new treatments for chronic pain.",

The present study aimed to investigate the inhibitory potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and beetroot extract (BRE) in albino rats after testicular toxicity induced by cisplatin. Thirty adult male albino rats were grouped into: the control group, Cis group receiving a single dose of 7 mg/kg i.p. (intraperitoneal) to induce testicular toxicity, Cis plus BM-MSCs injected Cis followed by 2 × 106 of BM-MSCs; Cis plus BRE group receiving Cis followed by 300 mg/kg body weight/day of BRE, and Cis plus BM-MSCs and BRE group. In the current study, Cis reduced sperm count, serum testosterone level, and testicular activity of alkaline phosphatase (AKP), besides a marked inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. In addition, it significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and along with a marked decrease in testis reduced glutathione content and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). At the same time, Cis administration resulted in a marked elevation in interleukine-6 and the iNOS and caspase-3 genes; however, it decreased the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Combined treatment with BM-MSCs and BRE resulted in great improvement of all previous parameters. These results were also confirmed by histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. In conclusion, both MSCs and BRE were found to have potent potentials to inhibit testicular damage induced by cisplatin."

A brief narrative and critical review on dietary nitrate intake effects are addressed herein by considering vegetable sources, dosage, intervention regimen and cardioprotective effects achieved in both healthy and cardiovascular-susceptible individuals. Compared to other nitrate-rich vegetables, beets were proven to be the best choice for non-drug therapy because of their sensorial characteristics and easy formulations that facilitate patient adherence for long periods, allied to bioaccessibility and consequent effectiveness. Beets were shown to be effective in raising nitrate and nitrite in biological fluids at levels capable of promoting sustained improvement in primary and advanced hemodynamic parameters."

      "abstract": "Patients with cancer are prone to several debilitating side effects including fatigue, insomnia, depression and cognitive disturbances. Beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) as a health promoting functional food may be potentially beneficial in cancer. As a source of polyphenols, flavonoids, dietary nitrates and other useful nutrients, beetroot supplementation may provide a holistic means to prevent cancer and manage undesired effects associated with chemotherapy. The main aim of this narrative review is to discuss beetroot's nutrient composition, current studies on its potential utility in chemoprevention and cancer-related fatigue or treatment-related side effects such as cardiotoxicity. This review aims to provide the current status of knowledge and to identify the related research gaps in this area. The flavonoids and polyphenolic components present in abundance in beetroot support its significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities. Most in vitro and in vivo studies have shown promising results; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying chemopreventive and chemoprotective effects of beetroot have not been completely elucidated. Although recent clinical trials have shown that beetroot supplementation improves human performance, translational studies on beetroot and its functional benefits in managing fatigue or other symptoms in patients with cancer are still lacking."

      "abstract": "Beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) has a high level of nitrate; therefore, its dietary intake could increase nitric oxide (NO) level in the body, possibly preventing the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH). In this study, we examined the effects of beetroot juice (BJ) supplementation on PH and the contribution of nitrate to such effects using a rat model of monocrotaline (MCT, 60 mg/kg s.c.)-induced PH. Rats were injected subcutaneously with saline or 60 mg/kg MCT and were sacrificed 28 days after the injection. In some rats injected with MCT, BJ was supplemented from the day of MCT injection to the day of sacrifice. First, MCT-induced right ventricular systolic pressure elevation, pulmonary arterial medial thickening and muscularization, and right ventricular hypertrophy were suppressed by supplementation with low-dose BJ (nitrate: 1.3 mmol/L) but not high-dose BJ (nitrate: 4.3 mmol/L). Of the plasma nitrite, nitrate, and their sum (NOx) levels, only the nitrate levels were found to be increased by the high-dose BJ supplementation. Second, in order to clarify the possible involvement of nitrate in the preventive effects of BJ on PH symptoms, the effects of nitrate-rich BJ (nitrate: 0.9 mmol/L) supplementation were compared with those of the nitrate-depleted BJ. While the former exerted preventive effects on PH symptoms, such effects were not observed in rats supplemented with nitrate-depleted BJ. Neither supplementation with nitrate-rich nor nitrate-depleted BJ affected plasma nitrite, nitrate, and NOx levels. These findings suggest that a suitable amount of BJ ingestion, which does not affect systemic NO levels, can prevent the development of PH in a nitrate-dependent manner. Therefore, BJ could be highly useful as a therapy in patients with PH.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women exhibit higher rates of disability and cardiovascular disease (CVD) with aging compared to men. Whereas habitual exercise training is a known strategy to enhance physiologic function in men and premenopausal women, exercise-related adaptations are often modest in postmenopausal women. We propose dietary nitrate (beetroot juice) administered prior to exercise training may be a feasible approach to improve mobility and cardio-metabolic health outcomes in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Our randomized, placebo-controlled study aims to determine preliminary effects sizes for changes in functional mobility and endothelium-dependent vasodilation across three study arms: exercise only (EX), exercise + placebo (EX + PL), and exercise + beetroot (EX + BR). Thirty-six postmenopausal women are recruited in small cohorts wherein group exercise is implemented to facilitate social support and adherence to an 8-week training progression. Participants are randomized to one of three study arms (n = 12 per group) following baseline assessments. Post-intervention assessments are used to determine pre-post changes in outcome measures including distance covered during a 6 min walk test, walking economy, muscle speed and power, and endothelial-dependent vasodilation as determined by flow-mediated dilation. Measures of feasibility include recruitment, retention, adherence to exercise prescription, perceived exercise session difficulty, and adverse event rates. DISCUSSION: Evidence-based, translational strategies are needed to optimize exercise training-related adaptations in postmenopausal women. Findings will inform larger randomized clinical trials to determine if pre-exercise consumption of beetroot juice is an efficacious strategy to promote mobility and attenuate CVD disease risk."

The aim of the study was to obtain and characterize three types of marmalade based on red beetroot, sour cherry and both in 1:1 combination, obtained by heating at 95 °C for 30 min. Changes in total phenolic content, total flavonoids, betalains, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity were evaluated before and after the thermal treatment. Several other analyses such as color, rheological and textural analyses and confocal laser microscopy were performed to provide further information about the quality of the added-value food products. A significant decrease of 34% in betalains content was registered in the red beetroot marmalade due to the chemical changes in bioactives induced by the temperature. A satisfactory ABTS radical scavenging activity of 8.12 ± 0.38 mMol Trolox/g dry weight (dw) was obtained for the red beetroot and sour cherry based marmalade. The gelled structure was validated by the rheological and textural characteristics. The results highlighted the potential use of red beetroot and sour cherry as food raw materials, due to their particular profile of bioactive compounds.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise training improves health outcomes in individuals with obesity (IO); however, it remains challenging for IO to adhere to exercise. Thus, it is critical to identify novel strategies that improve exercise tolerance (ET) and adherence in IO. Beetroot juice (BRJ), high in inorganic dietary nitrate, consistently improves exercise performance in athletes, individuals with cardiopulmonary diseases, and nonobese lean individuals. These improvements may be explained by reduced oxygen uptake (VO2 ) during exercise, enhanced blood flow, and greater mitochondrial efficiency. To date, we are aware of no studies that have compared the effects of BRJ, sodium nitrate (NaNO3), and nitrate-depleted BRJ (PLA) for improving ET and cardiometabolic health in IO. PURPOSE: Determine if BRJ improves ET, exercise efficiency (EE), and cardiometabolic health in IO and identify possible mechanisms of action. METHODS: Vascular hemodynamic, submaximal- and maximal-exercise VO2 , and time to exhaustion (TTE) were assessed in 16 participants 2.5 hr following consumption of: 1) BRJ, 2) NaNO3 , 3) PLA, or 4) CON. RESULTS: A significant treatment effect was observed for submaximal exercise VO2 (p = .003), and TTE (p < .001). Post hoc analyses revealed lower VO2 during submaximal exercise in BRJ compared to PLA (p = .009) NaNO3 (p = .042) and CON (0.009), equating to an average improvement of ~ 7% with BRJ. TTE was greater for BRJ compared to other treatment arms, PLA (p = .008), NaNO3 (p = .038), and CON (p=<0.001), equating to ~ 15% improvement with BRJ. No significant changes were observed for other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of BRJ improved EE during submaximal exercise by 7%, and TTE by 15% compared to other conditions. These results suggest that BRJ may improve EE and exercise tolerance in IO.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Beta vulgaris, commonly known as beetroot, is a vegetable that contains red pigment and rich in betalains, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. This study was designed to assess the effect of beetroot supplemented diet (BRSD) on cognitive function and altered neurochemicals associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the brain of rats treated with scopolamine (SCOP). METHODS: Rats were fed with BRSD (2 and 4%) for 14 days and administered with 2 mg/kg of SCOP intraperitoneally on the last day. Morris water Maze and Y-maze tests were performed to assess cognitive function. Purinergic enzymes [ectonucleotidase (NTPdase) and adenosine deaminase (ADA)], monoamine oxidase (MAO), and angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) activities were determined in rat brain tissues. Furthermore, catalase activity, total thiol (T-SH) and non-protein thiol (NP-SH) levels were also assessed. Beetroot was characterized using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the structure-activity relationship between the constituents and target enzymes was assessed. RESULTS: BRSD improved cognitive function by increasing memory index in SCOP treated rats. An increase in NTPdase, ADA, MAO, and ACE activities were observed in the brain of rats treated with SCOP. However, the activities of these enzymes were significantly lower after treatment with BRSD. Treatment with BRSD triggered a significant increase in catalase activity, T-SH and NP-SH levels in SCOP-treated rats. Catechin, 6,7-benzocoumarin, gentisin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavone, and vulgaxanthin I was identified in beetroots. DISCUSSION: The result suggests that beetroot could prevent cognitive dysfunction in SCOP-treated rats, and enhance memory function, via modulation of purinergic enzymes, MAO and ACE activities, and neuronal antioxidant status.",

      "abstract": "The cardioprotective effects of dietary nitrate from beetroot in healthy and hypertensive individuals are undeniable and irrefutable. Nitrate and nitrate-derived nitrite are precursors for nitric oxide synthesis exhibiting an effect on cardiomyocytes and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, improving endothelial function, reducing arterial stiffness and stimulating smooth muscle relaxation, decreasing systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Beetroot phytochemicals like betanin, saponins, polyphenols, and organic acids can resist simulated gastrointestinal digestion, raising the hypothesis that the cardioprotective effects of beetroots result from the combination of nitrate/nitrite and bioactive compounds that limit the generation of reactive oxygen species and modulate gene expression. Nitrate and phytochemical concentrations can be adjusted in beet formulations to fulfill requirements for acute or long-term supplementations, enhancing patient adherence to beet intervention. Based on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials, beet nitrate and its bioactive phytochemicals are promising as a novel supportive therapy to ameliorate cardiovascular diseases."

According to selected processing methods, the bioaccessibility of these compounds could be either enhanced or decreased. This study evaluated the effect of four different drying conditions: (1) Traditional Drying (TD), (2) Swell Drying (SD), (3) DIC Blanching + Traditional Drying (BTD), and (4) DIC Blanching + Swell Drying (BSD) on the antioxidant content and the antioxidant activity of red beetroots. Obtained results showed that in all the cases, by comparing to Traditional Drying (TD), the coupling of a DIC Blanching pre-treatment to a Swell Drying treatment (BSD) maintained or enhanced the preservation of the Total Phenolic Compounds (TPC), the Total Flavonoids Compounds (TFC), the Betanin Concentration (BC), the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), and the Free Radical Scavenging Activity by DPPH (IC50) of red beetroots. Various studies have shown that thanks to the expanded and porous structure triggered by the Swell Drying process, it has been possible to achieve better antioxidants extraction and better whole quality. Hence, by coupling DIC as a blanching-steaming pre-treatment, it was possible to preserve better the antioxidant content and the antioxidant activity of red dried beetroots.",

Dietary interventions such as inorganic nitrate or folic acid supplementation could represent promising strategies for reducing blood pressure (BP) in this setting. OBJECTIVES: This feasibility study explores the effects of dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation, alone or in combination with folic acid, on BP in Tanzanian adults with elevated BP in Tanzania. METHODS: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized controlled feasibility trial was conducted. Forty-seven middle-aged and older participants (age: 50-70 y, BMI: 26.3-29.1 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to 3 conditions for a period of 60 d: 1) high-nitrate beetroot juice (∼400 mg nitrate) and folic acid (∼5 mg folic acid) (N + F), 2) high-nitrate beetroot juice and placebo (N + P), or 3) nitrate-depleted beetroot juice and placebo (P + P). Clinic and 24-h ambulatory BP and measurements of compliance in plasma (nitrate and folate concentrations) and saliva (nitrate and nitrite) were obtained at baseline, 30 d, and 60 d. RESULTS: Baseline resting systolic and diastolic BP (mean ± SD) was 151.0 ± 19.4 mm Hg and 91.8 ± 11.7 mm Hg, respectively. Compliance to the interventions was high (>90%) in all groups which was confirmed by the significant increase in nitrate and folic acid concentrations in plasma and saliva samples in the treatment arms. After 60 d, 24-h systolic BP dropped by -10.8 ± 9.8 mm Hg (P < 0.001), -6.1 ± 13.2 mm Hg (P = 0.03), and -0.3 ± 9.7 mm Hg (P = 0.83) in the N + P, N + F, and P + P groups, respectively. There was a significant decrease in 24-h diastolic BP in the N + P group (-5.4 ± 5.0 mm Hg, P = 0.004), whereas changes were not significant in the N + F (-1.8 ± 8.1 mm Hg, P = 0.32) and P + P (1.6 ± 8.3 mm Hg, P = 0.43) groups. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary inorganic nitrate represents a potential nutritional strategy to lessen the hypertension epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. These findings support the rationale for future long-term investigations exploring the efficacy of dietary nitrate for lowering BP and attenuating cardiovascular disease risk in this setting.This trial was registered at isrctn.com as ISRCTN67978523.",

Color measurements might therefore serve as quick indicators of the potential health-promoting properties of such foods. Nevertheless, the relationship between color and pigment content depends on the type of matrix and pigment, as well as the factors affecting their interaction, which calls for further investigation. Hence, the aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between color parameters and betalain content in three commonly consumed beetroot products (beetroot juice, beetroot puree and whole beetroot), subjected to thermal treatment. Our results showed a negative correlation between the total betalain content and the color parameters L*, a*, b*, chroma, and hue angle in beetroot juice, beetroot puree and whole beetroot. Two chromatic parameters, a* and chroma, are proposed as the best descriptors for the betalain concentrations of these products. Likewise, the tristimulus L/ab combination for the juice is also suggested as a good descriptor. Our findings highlighted that the relationship between color and total betalain content depended on the beetroot product under assessment, with the strongest correlations found for the juice. Squeezed beetroot was therefore suggested as an alternative to improve this relationship in more complex matrices such as whole cooked beetroots. Useful information from color determination sheds light on the relationship between color and betalain pigments in beetroot, suggesting that color determination could be used as an indicator of betalain content."

AgNPs intoxication increased kidney function marker levels and lipid peroxidation and decreased the glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in kidney tissue. Additionally, Bcl-2 expression was downregulated following AgNPs intoxication. Moreover, AgNPs induced a significant increase in renal DNA damage displayed as an elevation in tail length, tail DNA percentage and tail moment. Interestingly, RBR post-treatment restored the biochemical and histological alterations induced by AgNPs exposure, reflecting its nephroprotective effect. Collectively, the present data suggest that RBR could be used as a potential therapeutic intervention to prevent AgNPs-induced nephrotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nanoparticles are at the forefront of rapidly developing nanotechnology and have gained much attention for their application as an effective drug delivery system and as a mediated therapeutic agent for cancer. However, the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles is still relatively unknown and, therefore, additional study is required in order to elucidate the potential toxicity of these nanoparticles on cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thus, the following work aimed to investigate the capability of Beta vulgaris (beetroot) water extract (BWE; 200 mg/kg) to protect hepatic tissue following silver nanoparticles (AgNPs; 80 mg/kg; >100 nm) intoxication in male rats. RESULTS: AgNPs-intoxication elevated the liver function markers - including serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase activities - and decreased serum levels of albumin and total proteins, in addition to disturbing the oxidation homeostasis. This is evidenced by the increased lipid peroxidation, the depleted glutathione, and the suppressed activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase. In addition, an apoptotic reaction was observed following AgNPs treatment, as indicated by the up-regulation of p53 and down-regulating Bcl-2 expressions, examined by the immunohistochemistry method. Furthermore, AgNPs exhibited a marked elevation in liver DNA damage that was indicated by an increase in tail length, tail DNA% and tail movement. However, BWE eliminated the biochemical and histological alterations, reflecting its hepatoprotection effect in response to AgNPs. DISCUSSION: Collectively, the present data suggest that BWE could be used following AgNPs as a potential therapeutic intervention to minimize AgNPs-induced liver toxicity.",

This study examined the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) testing the effects of prolonged consumption of incremental doses of dietary nitrate (NO3 -) in overweight and obese older participants. Secondary aims tested dose-dependent changes in cognitive, vascular and pulmonary functions and cerebral blood flow (CBF). METHODS: This was a single blind, four-arm parallel RCT conducted in 60 overweight and obese older participants. Eligible participants were randomized to:1) high NO3 - (140 ml of beetroot juice (BJ) per day, ~800 mg of NO3 -/day), 2) moderate NO3 - (70 ml of BJ per day, ~400 mg of NO3 -/day), 3) low NO3 - (70 ml on alternate days, ~400 mg of NO3 -) or 4) NO3 - depleted (70 ml on alternate days, ~0.001 mg of NO3). Measurements of cognitive, vascular and pulmonary functions and CBF were conducted at baseline and 13-weeks NO3 - intake was assessed by six 24-h recalls, and by measuring NO3 - intake biomarkers. Feasibility was assessed by obtaining qualitative feedback and evaluating trial recruitment, retention, compliance with study visits and measurement protocols. RESULTS: Participant recruitment started in July 2018 and ended in April 2019. Of all the recruitment strategies that were used, advertisement of the study via Facebook generated the highest response rate. Sixty-two participants consented and were enrolled. Overall, characteristics of included participants matched our recruitment criteria. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study provide evidence of the acceptability and feasibility of an intervention investigating the effects of incremental doses of high-nitrate BJ over a prolonged period. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The intervention study was registered with clinical trial ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN14746723) on 27 December 2018."

      "abstract": "KEY POINTS: Maternal hypertension is associated with increased rates of pregnancy pathologies, including fetal growth restriction, due at least in part to reductions in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and associated vascular dysfunction. Dietary nitrate supplementation, from beetroot juice (BRJ), has been shown to increase NO bioavailability and improve cardiovascular function in both preclinical and clinical studies. This study is the first to investigate effects of dietary nitrate supplementation in a pregnant animal model. Importantly, the effects of nitrate-containing BRJ were compared with both 'placebo' (nitrate-depleted) BRJ as well as water to control for potential nitrate-independent effects. Our data show novel, nitrate-independent effects of BRJ to lower blood pressure and improve vascular function in endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout (eNOS-/- ) mice. These findings suggest potential beneficial effects of BRJ supplementation in pregnancy, and emphasize the importance of accounting for nitrate-independent effects of BRJ in study design and interpretation. ABSTRACT: Maternal hypertension is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including fetal growth restriction (FGR), due in part to reductions in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. We hypothesized that maternal dietary nitrate administration would increase NO bioavailability to reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP), improve vascular function and increase fetal growth in pregnant endothelial NO synthase knockout (eNOS-/- ) mice, which exhibit hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and FGR. Pregnant wildtype (WT) and eNOS-/- mice were supplemented with nitrate-containing beetroot juice (BRJ+) from gestational day (GD) 12.5. Control mice received an equivalent dose of nitrate-depleted BRJ (BRJ-) or normal drinking water. At GD17.5, maternal SBP was measured; at GD18.5, maternal nitrate/nitrite concentrations, uterine artery (UtA) blood flow and endothelial function were assessed, and pregnancy outcomes were determined. Plasma nitrate concentrations were increased in both WT and eNOS-/- mice supplemented with BRJ+ (P < 0.001), whereas nitrite concentrations were increased only in eNOS-/- mice (P < 0.001). BRJ- did not alter nitrate/nitrite concentrations. SBP was lowered and UtA endothelial function was enhanced in eNOS-/- mice supplemented with either BRJ+ or BRJ-, indicating nitrate-independent effects of BRJ. Improvements in endothelial function in eNOS-/- mice were abrogated in the presence of 25 mm KCl, implicating enhanced EDH signalling in BRJ- treated animals. At GD18.5, eNOS-/- fetuses were significantly smaller than WT animals (P < 0.001), but BRJ supplementation did not affect fetal weight. BRJ may be a beneficial intervention in pregnancies associated with hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and reduced NO bioavailability. Our data showing biological effects of non-nitrate components of BRJ have implications for both interpretation of previous findings and in the design of future clinical trials.",

However, acute oral nutritional supplementation may alter urinary hydration assessments and potentially increase the likelihood of inappropriate clinical decisions or diagnosis. This investigation sought to examine the influence of three common over-the-counter nutritional supplements (beetroot, riboflavin, and Vitamin C) on urinary hydration assessments in physically active young men after a 2% exercise-induced dehydration. DESIGN: Eight males (Mean ± SD; age: 22 ± 3 yr; body mass index: 27 ± 5.0) consumed either a standard meal with supplementation (intervention) or a standard meal without supplementation (control). Participants performed a variety of aerobic or resistance exercises until reaching ≥2% body mass loss in a counter-balanced, double-blinded design. Following exercise participation, urine samples were collected for an 8 h observational period during which food consumption was replicated. Urine samples were analyzed for urine color, specific gravity, volume, and osmolality. Maintenance of ~2% body mass loss (2.6 ± 0.5%; range: 1.7-4.0%) was confirmed following the 8 h observational period. RESULTS: Statistically significant (p < 0.05) changes were noted in urine color following Vitamin C supplementation compared to control; however, the difference was not clinically meaningful. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that urine color, specific gravity, and osmolality maintain clinical utility to detect moderate levels of dehydration in physically active men consuming commercially available doses of beetroot, riboflavin, or Vitamin C.",

      "abstract": "Beetroot juice (BRJ) has become increasingly popular amongst athletes aiming to improve sport performances. BRJ contains high concentrations of nitrate, which can be converted into nitric oxide (NO) after consumption. NO has various functions in the human body, including a vasodilatory effect, which reduces blood pressure and increases oxygen- and nutrient delivery to various organs. These effects indicate that BRJ may have relevant applications in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, the consumption of BRJ also has an impact on oxygen delivery to skeletal muscles, muscle efficiency, tolerance and endurance and may thus have a positive impact on sports performances. Aside from the beneficial aspects of BRJ consumption, there may also be potential health risks. Drinking BRJ may easily increase nitrate intake above the acceptable daily intake, which is known to stimulate the endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOC's), a class of compounds that is known to be carcinogenic and that may also induce several other adverse effects. Compared to studies on the beneficial effects, the amount of data and literature on the negative effects of BRJ is rather limited, and should be increased in order to perform a balanced risk assessment.",

Several investigations were performed, such as phenolic content, antioxidant activity, betalains content and color. The samples pretreated by microwave have registered higher polyphenols content and antioxidant capacity than those ohmically heated. The ohmic heating pretreated samples registered highest values for ΔL = 7.33-7.65 and ΔH = 8.18-10.02.

Red beetroot juice (RBJ) may modulate endothelial function and other measures of cardiometabolic health. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the impact of acute and chronic RBJ consumption, including nitrate-dependent and -independent effects, on postprandial endothelial function and other cardiometabolic responses to a HFM. METHODS: Fifteen men and postmenopausal women with overweight/obesity were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-period, crossover clinical trial. Following an overnight fast, participants underwent baseline assessment of endothelial function (reactive hyperemia index; RHI) and hemodynamics, and biological sample collection. In random order, participants consumed 70 mL (acute visit) of: 1) RBJ, 2) nitrate-free RBJ (NF-RBJ), 3) placebo + nitrate (PBO + NIT), or 4) placebo (PBO), followed by a HFM. RHI was remeasured 4 h post-HFM, and hemodynamic assessment and biological sample collection were performed 1, 2, and 4 h post-HFM consumption. Participants consumed treatments daily for 4 wk (chronic visit), and assessments were repeated before/after the HFM (without consuming treatments). RESULTS: HFM consumption did not induce significant impairment of postprandial RHI. No significant differences in RHI were detected across treatment groups following acute or chronic exposure, despite increases in circulating nitrate/nitrite (NOx) concentrations in the RBJ and PBO + NIT groups compared with PBO and NF-RBJ (P < 0.0001 for all time points at the acute visit; P < 0.05 for all time points at the chronic visit). Although the HFM led to significant alterations in several secondary outcomes, there were no consistent treatment effects on postprandial cardiometabolic responses. CONCLUSIONS: HFM consumption did not impair postprandial endothelial function in this population, and RBJ exposure did not alter postprandial endothelial function or other outcomes despite increasing NOx concentrations. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02949115."

We randomized 22 previously functional acute respiratory failure patients to either BRJ or placebo daily until day 14 or discharge. We measured blood nitrate and nitrite levels and quantified strength and physical function at intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital discharge. Participants were predominantly male (54%), aged 68.5 years with an APACHE III score of 62. BRJ increased plasma nitrate (mean 219.2 μM increase, p = 0.002) and nitrite levels (mean 0.144 μM increase, p = 0.02). We identified no adverse events. The unadjusted and adjusted effect sizes of the intervention on the short physical performance battery were small (d = 0.12 and d = 0.17, respectively). In this pilot trial, administration of BRJ was feasible and safe, increased blood nitrate and nitrate levels, but had a small effect on physical function. Future studies could evaluate the clinical efficacy of BRJ as a therapy to improve physical function in survivors of critical illness.",

      "abstract": "In modern agriculture, besides providing high and stable yields, it is imperative to produce products with a high nutritive quality. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of different fertilization regimes on the macro- and micronutrients in beetroot. A 3-year field trial was set up according to a Latin square method with four types of fertilization (unfertilized control, 50 t stable manure ha-1, and 500 and 1,000 kg NPK 5-20-30 ha-1). The mineral content was determined as follows (mg 100 g-1 in fresh weight of beetroot): 14-29 P, 189-354 K, 18-34 Ca, 17-44 Mg, 0.67-1.83 Fe, 0.41-0.65 Mn and 0.28-0.44 Zn. The highest beetroot P content was determined for the treatment with stable manure, especially in a year with dry climatic conditions. The highest beetroot K content was determined for the treatment with 1,000 kg NPK 5-20-30 ha-1, but at the same time for the same treatment, a general decreasing trend of micronutrient content was determined, due to the possible antagonistic effect of added potassium. For better mineral status of beetroot, application of combined mineral and organic fertilizers supplemented with additional foliar application of micronutrients can be suggested.",

      "abstract": "The ergogenic effects of citrulline malate (CitMal) and beetroot juice (BEET) have been widely studied, but their effects on physiological outcomes related to resistance exercise are not fully understood. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, crossover study was to investigate the effects of CitMal (8 g) and BEET (400 mg nitrate) on blood pressure (BP), blood flow, and energy efficiency during submaximal leg extension. Recreationally active males (n = 27; age: 22 ± 4 yrs) completed familiarization, followed by three testing visits. Supine and standing BP were measured upon arrival, followed by supplement ingestion, a 2-h rest period, postsupplement BP measurement, and a bout of repeated submaximal isotonic leg extensions at 25% of maximal voluntary contraction torque. Diameter (aDIAM) and blood flow (aBF) of the superficial femoral artery, and cross-sectional area (CSA) and echo intensity (EI) of the vastus lateralis, were measured before and after exercise via ultrasonography. Muscle blood flow (mBF) and oxygen consumption (mVO2), along with whole-body energy expenditure (EE) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER), were measured before and during exercise via indirect calorimetry and near-infrared spectroscopy. Baseline RER values differed among treatments (p = 0.01); BEET was higher than CitMal (p = 0.01) but not PLA (p = 0.58); CitMal and PLA were not significantly different (p = 0.12). No other measurements were significantly affected by treatment (all p > 0.05). Results suggest that neither CitMal nor BEET significantly influence resting BP, blood flow, or metabolic efficiency during submaximal leg extension in recreationally active males.",

      "abstract": "Betalains are vacuolar pigments present in tubers, flowers or fruits. Their use in the food industry is significant because they are considered bioactive completely safe to consume. However, betalains are susceptible to temperature which affects their stability. The most of the available methods that determine stability involve high costs, are destructive and generate waste. In this work was evaluated the thermal degradation of betalain at 75 °C for several intervals of time, by using different techniques. Colorimetry showed a change in the tone angle (h°) from 359.76° to 20.54° after the heat-treatment, suggesting thermal degradation by changing the color from violet to red-orange. High-pressure liquid chromatography, shows the decrease of the concentration of betanin in addition to the formation of neobetanin, the main degradation product in betalains. UV-visible spectrophotometry suggest also thermal degradation of betanin, by the decrease of the absorption at 538 nm caused by the heat treatment. Finally, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed a decrease in the intensity of two absorption bands at 1243 and 879 cm-1, corresponding to the C-O and C-C vibrations of the carboxylic acid respectively after heat treatment. These results suggest that the main route of degradation corresponds to decarboxylation. We propose the use of FTIR spectroscopy as a practical alternative for the analysis of the degradation of natural dyes during storage, making evident the possible use of this methodology for industrial applications."

Effects of citrulline malate and beetroot juice supplementation on blood flow, energy metabolism, and performance during maximum effort leg extension exercise. J Strength Cond Res 33(9): 2321-2329, 2019-Citrulline malate (CitMal) and beetroot juice (BEET) are increasingly popular ergogenic aids, but few studies have rigorously investigated their effects on resistance exercise performance and underlying mechanisms. The current randomized, double-blind, crossover study evaluated the effects of CitMal and BEET supplementation on blood flow, metabolic efficiency, and performance during maximal isokinetic leg extension exercise. After familiarization, 27 recreationally active men (age: 22 ± 4 years) completed 3 visits in which subjects ingested a treatment beverage (CitMal [8 g], BEET [400-mg nitrate], or placebo [PLA]), followed by a 2-hour rest period, warm-up, and 5 sets of 30 concentric leg extensions. Before and after exercise, ultrasound was used to measure diameter (aDIAM) and blood flow (aBF) of the superficial femoral artery, along with cross-sectional area and echo intensity of the vastus lateralis. Plasma analytes (lactate, nitrate/nitrite [NOx], and urea nitrogen [BUN]) were also assessed at these times, and indirect calorimetry was used to measure energy expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio before and during exercise. Resting NOx values were higher in BEET (233.2 ± 1.1 μmol·L) compared with CitMal (15.3 ± 1.1, p < 0.0001) and PLA (13.4 ± 1.1, p < 0.0001). Postexercise NOx values, adjusted for resting differences, were higher in BEET (86.3 ± 1.2 μmol·L) than CitMal (21.3 ± 1.1, p < 0.0001) and PLA (18.1 ± 1.1, p < 0.0001). No other variables were affected by treatment (all p > 0.05). While BEET increased NOx, neither treatment was found to enhance performance, blood flow, metabolic efficiency, nor the hormonal response to leg extension exercise.",

      "abstract": "Beetroot is a root vegetable rich in different bioactive components, such as vitamins, minerals, phenolics, carotenoids, nitrate, ascorbic acids, and betalains, that can have a positive effect on human health. The aim of this work was to study the influence of the pulsed electric field (PEF) at different electric field strengths (4.38 and 6.25 kV/cm), pulse number 10-30, and energy input 0-12.5 kJ/kg as a pretreatment method on the extraction of betalains from beetroot. The obtained results showed that the application of PEF pre-treatment significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the efficiency of extraction of bioactive compounds from beetroot. The highest increase in the content of betalain compounds in the red beet's extract (betanin by 329%, vulgaxanthin by 244%, compared to the control sample), was noted for 20 pulses of electric field at 4.38 kV/cm of strength. Treatment of the plant material with a PEF also resulted in an increase in the electrical conductivity compared to the non-treated sample due to the increase in cell membrane permeability, which was associated with leakage of substances able to conduct electricity, including mineral salts, into the intercellular space."

      "abstract": "Consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BRJ) by athletes induces a number of beneficial physiological health effects, which are linked to the formation of nitric oxide (NO) from nitrate. However, following a secondary pathway, NO may also lead to the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), which are known to be carcinogenic in 39 animal species. The extent of the formation of NOCs is modulated by various other dietary factors, such as vitamin C. The present study investigates the endogenous formation of NOCs after BRJ intake and the impact of vitamin C on urinary NOC excretion. In a randomized, controlled trial, 29 healthy recreationally active volunteers ingested BRJ with or without additional vitamin C supplements for one week. A significant increase of urinary apparent total N-nitroso Compounds (ATNC) was found after one dose (5 to 47 nmol/mmol: p < 0.0001) and a further increase was found after seven consecutive doses of BRJ (104 nmol/mmol: p < 0.0001). Vitamin C supplementation inhibited ATNC increase after one dose (16 compared to 72 nmol/mmol, p < 0.01), but not after seven daily doses. This is the first study that shows that BRJ supplementation leads to an increase in formation of potentially carcinogenic NOCs. In order to protect athlete's health, it is therefore important to be cautious with chronic use of BRJ to enhance sports performances.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Betanins have become excellent replacers for artificial red-purple food colourants. Red beet (Beta vulgaris L. spp. vulgaris) known as beetroot, is a rich source of betalains, which major forms are betanin (red to purple) and vulgaxanthin (yellow). Betalains and phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites, accumulation of which is often triggered by elicitors during plant stress responses. In the present study, pre-harvest applications of ethephon (an ethylene-releasing compound) and postharvest UV-B radiation were tested as elicitors of betalains and phenolic compounds in two beetroot cultivars. Their effects on quality parameters were investigated, and the expression of biosynthetic betalain genes in response to ethephon was determined. RESULTS: Ethephon was applied as foliar spray during the growth of beetroot, resulting in increased betanin (22.5%) and decreased soluble solids contents (9.4%), without detrimental effects on beetroot yield. The most rapid accumulation rate for betanin and soluble solids was observed between 3 and 6 weeks after sowing in both untreated and ethephon-treated beetroots. Overall, the expression of the betalain biosynthetic genes (CYP76AD1, CYP76AD5, CYP76AD6 and DODA1), determining the formation of both betanin and vulgaxanthin, increased in response to ethephon treatment, as did the expression of the betalain pathway activator BvMYB1. In the postharvest environment, the use of short-term UV-B radiation (1.23 kJ m- 2) followed by storages for 3 and 7 days at 15 °C resulted in increased betanin to vulgaxanthin ratio (51%) and phenolic content (15%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide novel strategies to improve key profitability traits in betalain production. High betanin concentration and high betanin to vulgaxanthin ratio increase the commercial value of the colourant product. In addition, lowering soluble solids levels facilitates higher concentration of beetroot colour during processing. Moreover, we show that enhanced betanin content in ethephon-treated beetroots is linked to increased expression of betalain biosynthetic genes.",

      "abstract": "According to current therapeutic approaches, a nitrate-dietary supplementation with beetroot juice (BRJ) is postulated as a nutritional strategy that might help to control arterial blood pressure in healthy subjects, pre-hypertensive population, and even patients diagnosed and treated with drugs. In this sense, a systematic review of random clinical trials (RCTs) published from 2008 to 2018 from PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, and manual searches was conducted to identify studies examining the relationship between BRJ and blood pressure. The specific inclusion criteria were: (1) RCTs; (2) trials that assessed only the BRJ intake with control group; and (3) trials that reported the effects of this intervention on blood pressure. The search identified 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. This review was able to demonstrate that BRJ supplementation is a cost-effective strategy that might reduce blood pressure in different populations, probably through the nitrate/nitrite/nitric oxide (NO₃-/NO₂-/NO) pathway and secondary metabolites found in Beta vulgaris. This easily found and cheap dietary intervention could significantly decrease the risk of suffering cardiovascular events and, in doing so, would help to diminish the mortality rate associated to this pathology. Hence, BRJ supplementation should be promoted as a key component of a healthy lifestyle to control blood pressure in healthy and hypertensive individuals. However, several factors related to BRJ intake (e.g., gender, secondary metabolites present in B. vulgaris, etc.) should be studied more deeply.",
