      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Convolvulus pluricaulis is a native plant that is commonly mentioned in Ayurveda as a Rasayana and is primarily recommended for use in mental stimulation and rejuvenation therapy. Convolvulus pluricaulis is used as a brain tonic. The plant is reported to be a prominent memory-improving drug. It is used as a psychostimulant and tranquilizer. It is reported to reduce mental tension. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to explore the protective effect of hydroalcoholic extract from the leaves of Convolvulus pluricaulis along with CNS depressant and anti-anxiety activities, in models of mice. METHODS: The extract from leaves of Convolvulus pluricaulis were sequentially isolated with a mixture of water and alcohol solution in the soxhlet apparatus. An acute toxicity study was conducted as per OECD guidelines no. 423, in which 18 Albino male mice were treated with different doses (1, 10, 100, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg) of hydroalcoholic extract of Convolvulus pluricaulis and assessed for toxicity parameters for 14 days. Various psychomotor activities of hydroalcoholic extract from leaves of Convolvulus pluricaulis for 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg doses were performed in mice by using various tests like actophotometer, open field, rota-rod, grip strength tests, elevated plus maze, hole board test, inclined plane, chimney test. RESULTS: The hydroalcoholic extract from leaves of Convolvulus pluricaulis was found to fall under category 4 in the acute toxicity study. Therefore, 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg doses of hydroalcoholic extract of leaves of Convolvulus pluricaulis were selected for the further pharmacological study. The results of psychomotor tests (actophotometer, open field, rota-rod, grip strength, hole board test, inclined plane, chimney test, elevated plus maze, light-dark model) for test doses 100, 200, and 300 in mice showed CNS depressant and anti-anxiety effects. CONCLUSION: Hydroalcoholic extract from leaves of Convolvulus pluricaulis at the 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg doses has shown CNS depressant and anti-anxiety effects in mice models.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The methanolic extract of Convolvulus pluricaulis had earlier shown lipid lowering activity in Triton induced reversible hyperlipidemia model, but, the hypolipidemic activity in irreversible models and hypoglycaemic activity are not investigated so far. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to validate the lipid and glucose-lowering actions of C. pluricaulis methanolic extract (CPME) by using ingredients from the Indian diet for induction of hyperlipidemia and diabetes on experimental rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental animals were divided into four groups having six animals in each group (n = 6). Animals of Group I II, III and IV received - no treatment, 0.9% NaCl, Glipizide (GPZ) 5 mg/kg and CPME 400 mg/kg once daily for two weeks respectively. Animals of all groups except group I were fed a high fat-based Indian diet for 21 days followed by a single STZ (35 mg/kg) i.p. administration in model induction phase. Afterwards, animals were sacrificed, and the pancreas was dissected for histological changes, and blood was collected for measuring lipid parameters, FBS, insulin levels, and HOMA scores. RESULTS: CPME significantly ameliorate the lipid abnormalities in HFD-STZ-treated experimental model (p < 0.001) but fails to reverse the hyperglycaemia developed in diabetic rats with no protective effect on islet architecture (p > 0.05) as compared to experimental group while, GPZ showed protective effect on both lipid abnormalities and hyperglycemia by modulating the levels of lipid parameters and insulin respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the study confirm that CPME possesses significant hypolipidemic activity but fails to reverse the hyperglycaemia developed in diabetic rats."

      "abstract": "The memory-boosting property of Indian traditional herb, Convolvulus pluricaulis, has been documented in literature; however, its effect on synaptic plasticity has not yet been reported. Two important forms of synaptic plasticity known to be involved in the processes of memory formation are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). In the present study, the effect of C. pluricaulis plant extract on LTP and LTD were evaluated. The adult male Wistar rats were fed orally with 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg of this extract for 4 weeks and the effect was determined on LTP and LTD in the Schaffer collaterals of the hippocampal cornu ammonis region CA1. We found that the 500 mg/kg dose of the extract could significantly enhance LTP compared to the vehicle treated ones. Moreover, the same dose could also reduce LTD while used in a separate set of animals. Also, a fresh group of animals treated with the effective dose (500 mg/kg) of plant extract were examined for memory retention in two behavioral platforms namely, contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and novel object recognition test (NORT). Increased fear response to the conditioned stimulus and enhanced recognition of objects were observed in CFC and NORT, respectively, both indicating strengthening of memory. Following up, ex-vivo electrophysiology experiments were performed with the active single molecule scopoletin, present in C. pluricaulis extract and similar patterns in synaptic plasticity changes were obtained. These findings suggest that prolonged treatment of C. pluricaulis extract, at a specific dose in healthy animals, can augment memory functions by modulating hippocampal plasticity.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a heterogeneous disorder and has been regarded as an inflammatory disease. The aerial parts of the Convolvulus pluricaulis are used in Indian traditional medicines for the management of nervous disorders. However, the influence of methanolic extract of aerial parts of Convolvulus pluricaulis (CPE) on a chronic animal model of depression has not been investigated yet, and associated biochemical changes are still unclear. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of CPE on a chronic rat model of depression and explores its underlying mechanism of action on neuroinflammation and brain monoamines. The antidepressant-like effect of CPE (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) was depicted using the sucrose preference test and the forced swimming test (FST) while CUMS-induced alteration in the locomotor index was measured using the open field test (OFT) and actophotometer. A consecutive one-week treatment of CPE (50, and 100 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) treatment significantly increased sucrose preference index, reduced immobility time in the FST, and increased the number of squares crossed, the number of rearing in the OFT and locomotion in the actophotometer in the CUMS-exposed rats. Moreover, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and liver biomarkers ALT, AST were also significantly reversed by CPE (50, and 100 mg/kg) or fluoxetine administration in the CUMS-exposed rats. Furthermore, a one-week treatment of CPE (50 and 100 mg/kg) or fluoxetine also remarkably restored the serotonin and noradrenaline levels in the hippocampus as well as in the prefrontal cortex of the CUMS-exposed rats. However, CPE (25 mg/kg) exerted insignificant protection against CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior and associated neuroinflammation. Therefore, this study demonstrates that CPE exerted antidepressant-like effect which could be mediated by anti-inflammatory potential, restoring liver biomarkers or monoaminergic responses in the stressed rats.",

METHODS: The study comprised of six groups namely normal control, experimental control and treatment groups (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of C. pluricaulis, and 65 mg/kg of Fenofibrate). Hyperlipidaemia was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of Triton WR-1339 400 mg/kg in rats. Parameters such as lipid profile, oxidative stress, histological analysis and atherogenic index were evaluated. The plant extract was further studied by HPLC and LCMS, for analyses of active phytochemicals. KEY FINDINGS: The result of the study showed that C. pluricaulis significantly decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-c, MDA levels and atherogenic index while the levels of HDL-c and GSH were found to be raised. Plant extract at the dose of 400 mg had a consistent effect on all lipid profile parameters. Lower doses (100 and 200 mg) did not produce a statistically significant reduction in LDL-c. In addition, the protective effect of C. pluricaulis was confirmed by histological analysis. Further, the findings of the study were found to be comparable with fenofibrate. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the present study suggests that C. pluricaulis has the potential for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To isolate the neuroprotective component from Convolvulus pluricaulis Chois. (Convolvulaceae) which can be used as a lead molecule in the treatment of Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: The methanolic extract of whole plant was fractionated into four fractions; chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and aqueous fraction. The chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions were pooled on the basis of antioxidant activity and TLC profile and charged into silica gel column. Four subfractions were collected from column (FrA, FrB, FrC, and FrD) and further assessed for antioxidant potential by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl in vitro assay. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) was administered to Wister rats for induction of HD. Different fractions were administered for 14 days. Different behavioral alterations were assessed in between study period. Animals were euthanized immediately following the last behavioral session, and biochemical parameters were measured. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: Systemic administration of 3-NP showed marked motor deficits and oxidative damage in rats. Only FrB showed significant antioxidant activity and on further purification gave pure compound (scopoletin). Our study showed that FrB (20 mg/kg) pre-treatment significantly attenuated the loss in body weight, improved the locomotor activity, grip strength, and gait abnormalities. It also has attenuated the increased malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, and restored superoxide dismutase and reduced GSH enzyme activity in the striatum and cortex in 3-NP-treated groups. These results suggest that C. pluricaulis Chois. exhibits a neuroprotective effect by accelerating brain antioxidant defense mechanisms in 3-NP-treated rats.",

      "abstract": "Convolvulus pluricaulis Choisy (C. pluricaulis) is a perennial herb that seems like morning glory. All parts of the herb are known to possess therapeutic benefits. The plant is used locally in Indian and Chinese medicine to cure various diseases. It is used in Ayurvedic formulation for chronic cough, sleeplessness, epilepsy, hallucinations, anxiety etc. Based on the comprehensive review of plant profile, pharmacognosy, phytochemistry, pharmacological and toxicological data on the C. pluricaulis, there will be more opportunities for the future research and development on the herb C. pluricaulis. Information on the C. pluricaulis was collected via electronic search (using Pub Med, SciFinder, Google Scholar and Web of Science) and library search for articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Furthermore, information also was obtained from some local books on ethnopharmacology. This paper covers the literature, primarily pharmacological, from 1985 to the end of 2012. The C. pluricaulis is an important indigenous medicine, which has a long medicinal application for liver disease, epileptic disease, microbial disease, cytotoxic and viral diseases, central nervous system (CNS) disease in Ayurvedic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and other indigenous medical systems. The isolated metabolites and crude extract have exhibited a wide of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effect, including CNS depression, anxiolytic, tranquillizing, antidepressant, antistress, neurodegenerative, antiamnesic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, immunomodulatory, analgesic, antifungal, antibacterial, antidiabetic, antiulcer, anticatatonic, and cardiovascular activity. A chemical study of this plant was then initiated, which led to the isolation of carbohydrats, proteins, alkaloids, fatty acids, steroids, coumarins, flavanoids, and glycosides as active chemicals that bring about its biological effects. A series of pharmacognostical studies of this plant show that it is a herb, its stem and leaves are hairy, more over it has two types of stomata, anisocytic and paracytic. A herb, C. pluricaulis has emerged as a good source of the traditional medicine for the treatment of liver disease, epileptic disease, microbial disease, cytotoxic and viral diseases, and CNS disease. Pharmacological results have validated the use of this species in traditional medicine. All the parts of the herb are known to possess therapeutic benefits. Expansion of research materials would provide more opportunities for the discovery of new bioactive principles from C. pluricaulis."

A. racemosus and C. pluricaulis at the dose of 200 mg/kg, po showed significantly higher percent retentions, than piracetam. Multiple treatment with A. racemosus and C. pluricaulis for three days also demonstrated significant dose dependent increase in percent retentions as compared to control group. The effect was more prominent with C. pluricaulis as compared with piracetam and A. racemosus. A significantly lower percent retention in aged mice was observed as compared to young mice. Aged mice (18-20 months) showed higher transfer latency (TL) values on first and second day (after 24 h) as compared to young mice, indicating impairment in learning and memory. Pretreatment with A. racemosus and C. pluricaulis for 7 days enhanced memory in aged mice, as significant increase in percent retention was observed. Significantly higher retention was observed with C. pluricaulis (200 mg/kg; po) as compared with piracetam (10 mg/kg/; po). Post-trial administration of C. pluricaulis and A. racemosus extract demonstrated significant decrease in latency time during retention trials. Hippocampal regions associated with the learning and memory functions showed dose dependent increase in AChE activity in CA 1 with A. reacemosus and CA3 area with C. pluracaulis treatment. The underlying mechanism of these actions of A. racemosus and C. pluricaulis may be attributed to their antioxidant, neuroprotective and cholinergic properties.",

      "abstract": "Convolvulus pluricaulis is an indigenous plant commonly mentioned in Ayurveda, an ancient system of Indian medicine, as a rasayana which is mainly advocated for use in rejuvenation therapy. The present study was conducted to evaluate the potential anti-ulcerogenic effect of juice of fresh whole plants of C. pluricaulis (CPJ) against various experimental gastric ulcer models induced by ethanol, aspirin, 2 hr cold restraint stress and 4 hr pyloric ligation in rats. The drug was given orally twice daily for five days in the doses of 375 and 750 mg/kg body weight. CPJ showed anti-ulcerogenic effect at both doses in all the experimental gastric ulcer models and was comparable to the reference drug sucralfate (250 mg/kg). Gastric juice secretion and mucosal studies were undertaken to find out the possible mechanism of action of antiulcer effect by studying its effects both on offensive and defensive mucosal factors. The antiulcerogenic effect of CPJ was found to be due to augmentation of mucosal defensive factors like mucin secretion, lifespan of mucosal cells and glycoprotiens rather than on the offensive factors like acid-pepsin.",

      "abstract": "An investigation was made to evaluate the role of Convolvulus pluricaulis root extract in the regulation of hyperthyroidism in female mice. Its possible site of action was also studied. L-Thyroxine treatment for 30 days increased serum concentrations of thyroxine (T4) and triodothyronine (T3). The activity of hepatic 5'-monodeiodinase (5'-DI) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) was also enhanced. On the other hand, administration of the plant extract either alone or with L-T4, decreased serum T3 concentration and the activity of hepatic 5'-DI and G-6-phase, without marked alteration in hepatic lipid peroxidation, indicating the possible regulation of hyperthyroidism by the plant extract. It appears that the action of the plant extract on thyroid function is primarily mediated through the inhibition of 5'-DI enzyme activity.",
