      "abstract": "The roselle flower (Hibiscus sabdariffa) has shown potential as an alternative therapy for bone regeneration. This flower extract can induce osteoblast maturation, which is crucial for forming new bone. The study aim was to evaluate the viability of the 7F2 preosteoblast cell line following the application of a roselle flower nanoemulsion extract (RNE).This study utilized the 7F2 preosteoblast cell line to assess cell viability (%). The RNE was oven-dried at 35 to 40°C for 6 hours, resulting in a solid extract. The extract was then diluted into different concentrations. The preparation of 1% RNE was stirred at 1,400 rpm at 50°C for 90 minutes. Primary cultures of preosteoblast cell lines (7F2 cells) were distributed across 10 wells. Well 1 served as the positive control, representing 100% cell viability. Well 2 acted as the media control, containing only culture media without cells, representing 0% cell viability. Wells 3 to 10 were exposed to 1% RNE at serial concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56, and 0.78%. The viability of the 7F2 preosteoblast cell line was assessed using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide or microtetrazolium assay. The treatment was conducted on days 1, 3, and 7 for observation.The findings indicated that the highest cell viability was observed on day 7, averaging 89.27% at a 0.78% concentration, while the lowest viability was 2.60% at a 100% concentration.These results suggest that RNE is nontoxic to the 7F2 preosteoblast cell line."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The orthodontic mini-implant (OMI) failure often occurs due to the accumulation of peri-implantitis bacteria surrounding it, which results in a stable, resistant form of absolute skeletal anchorage during orthodontic treatment. Administering doxycycline may be the solution, but long-term side effects result in antibiotic resistance. Roselle flowers (Hibiscus sabdariffa) possess beneficial active phytochemical substances, which may have potential as an OMI peri-implantitis alternative therapy. This study investigates the antibacterial activity of 1 % Roselle flower (H. sabdarifa) nanoemulsion (NE) extract (1 % RNE) toward peri-implantitis bacteria in OMIs. METHODS: A phytochemical analysis of 1 % RNE was carried out to examine the active substances possessed in it, such as flavonoids, quinone, saponin, alkaloids, tannins, terpenoids, and steroids. Nanoemulsion characterization was carried out using a particle size analyzer (PSA). The antibacterial activity of 1 % RNE toward Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) was carried out to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, and inhibitory zone compared with doxycycline as a positive control. RESULTS: Roselle flower NE extract (1 %) possessed flavonoids, quinone, saponin, alkaloids, tannins, terpenoids, and steroids positively. The PSA showed that the 1 % RNE had a size of 98.13 d nm. The antibacterial activity of 1 % RNE against Aa, Pg, Pi, and Fn bacteria at 3.125 % showed significant differences (p < 0.05). The antibacterial activity of 1 % RNE toward peri-implantitis bacteria is lower than that of doxycycline. CONCLUSION: Roselle flower NE extract (1 %) has antibacterial activity against peri-implantitis bacteria at a concentration of 3.125 %."

      "abstract": "Adding plant extracts to sausage and other meat products is very important to improve their quality, safety, and durability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological properties of beef sausage enriched with roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) sepal extract. The total content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in hydroalcoholic extract of Roselle sepals was measured by Folin-Ciocalteu test and aluminum chloride colorimetric method, and antioxidant activity was measured by DPPH method. Pectin was used to encapsulate the extract. The characteristics of capsules, including particle size, zeta potential, and capsule efficiency were measured. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of extracts were performed by tube dilution method. Microbial tests were performed on sausage treatment samples. Analysis of the obtained data was done using SPSS and Excel software. The study revealed that the total phenolic and flavonoid compounds in the extract were 174.6 mg of gallic acid per gram and 16.8368 mg of quercetin, respectively. The extract displayed the highest antioxidant activity at elevated concentrations. Particle size ranged from 16.833 to 640.534 μm. The zeta potential and capsule efficiency were found to be satisfactory. Compared to the encapsulated extract, the free roselle extract better inhibited Staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), and Escherichia coli (E.coli). During storage until day 20, these bacteria did not grow in the free or encapsulated extract groups. However, S. aureus appeared in the free extract group from day 25 and the encapsulated extract group from day 20. Roselle extract has antimicrobial properties that can improve the quality and safety of beef sausage during storage."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. extract (HS) as an adjunct to valsartan in the treatment of high blood pressure in patients with mild chronic kidney disease (CKD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This trial was conducted in Gorgan, Iran. Seventy-two participants with CKD and high blood pressure were randomly assigned to either the HS group, receiving a 350 mg pill every 12 hr for 90 days along with 40 mg of valsartan every 12 hr, or the control group (40 mg valsartan + 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide). The primary objective was to assess the improvement of hypertension, while secondary objectives included the evaluation of proteinuria, albuminuria, kidney function, lipid profile, and electrolyte levels. Molecular docking analysis was performed to examine the mechanisms of action of the isolated components of HS. RESULTS: Out of 80 initial participants, 72 were included in the analysis. Both groups showed a significant reduction in blood pressure (p<0.001). The HS group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in lipid profile (p<0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding the reduction of renal markers. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the compounds present in HS, particularly its anthocyanins and flavonoids, exhibited greater angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory potential than hydrochlorothiazide in both domains. Moreover, the compounds met the criteria for drug likeness and Lipinski rules. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive therapy with HS showed promising results in reducing hypertension and improving lipid profile in patients with CKD."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) can occur as a result of micronutrient deficiencies. Hibiscus sabdarifa, a plant used in traditional medicine, contains ingredients that can help prevent this process. This study looked at the potency of Hibiscus sabdariffa Ethanol Extract (HSE) to prevent homocysteine-induced liver damage in animals that were deficient in vitamin B12. Materials and Methods: A comparative study of the effects of roselle extract is presented in an experimental design. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups using randomization. To demonstrate the absence of liver damage in the experimental animals under normal conditions, a control group was fed a normal diet without HSE. For the induction of liver damage in the experimental animals, the vitamin B12-restricted group was administered a vitamin B12-restricted diet. To test the effect of HSE on liver damage, the treatment group was given HSE along with a vitamin B12-restricted diet. Each group was given two treatment periods of eight and sixteen weeks. These results were compared with the results of the parameter examination between the vitamin B12 restriction group, with and without HSE, using an ANOVA statistic. The data were analyzed with licensed SPSS 20.0 software. Results: HSE significantly increased the blood levels of vitamin B12 while lowering homocysteine levels. The administration of HSE reduced liver damage based on the activity of liver function enzymes in the plasma due to a limitation of vitamin B12. HSE decreased Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1c (SREBP1c) and Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFkB) protein expressions in the liver tissue, but did not decrease Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) protein expression. Significantly, the levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a) and IL-6 in the liver tissue were lower, while the levels of IL-10 and Nuclear factor-erythroid-2 Related Factor 2 (NRF2) were higher with HSE administration. HSE produced a better histopathological profile of the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-Masson tricrome for inflammation, fat and fibrosis in the liver. Conclusions: In this study, HSE was found to slow the development of liver damage in experimental animals that were given a vitamin B12-deficient diet.",

      "abstract": "Seed decay is a major problem caused by pathogens that adversely affect seed yield and quality in agricultural production. Herein, the effect of 28 KHz ultrasound treatment for 20, 40 and 60 min and 1.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 20 min was assessed for the decontamination of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) seeds. In addition, seed germination indices, seedling growth traits, total phenolic content and the activity of defense-related enzymes, viz. peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and malondialdehyde were measured in the treated seeds. An isolate of Fusarium solani was obtained from roselle seeds and identified as the causal agent of roselle seed rot based on morphological and molecular characteristics. After six days of seed storage, the microbial infection caused the highest seed rot in the control seeds on the average of 56.67%, whereas ultrasound treatment for 60 min could remarkably reduce the seed decay by 3.33%. At the end of seed storage, the fungal load showed the highest (7.72 Log CFU ml-1) and lowest (6.99 Log CFU ml-1) rates in the control and ultrasound treatment for 60 min, respectively. Total phenolic content was significantly increased in ultrasound treatment for 60 min compared to control and sodium hypochlorite treatments. Moreover, the activity of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase was noticeably improved in ultrasound treatment for 60 min. Furthermore, ultrasound treatment did not show any adverse effects on seed germination indices and seedling growth traits of the roselle plants. Overall, ultrasound treatment for 60 min could effectively decrease roselle seed decay and the fungal load without changing seed and seedling quality.",

      "abstract": "Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) belongs to the genus Hibiscus with proven anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. Scientific evidence associated roselle content with bioactive compounds, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and anthocyanin. Most studies focused on their petals, while research on leaf extract on wound healing has never been done. This study aimed to assess the effect of roselle leaf extract on wound healing in rats. This was an experimental laboratory study with a posttest-only control group design. There were 30 rats divided into 5 groups: negative control, 5%, 10%, and 15% roselle leaf extract, and positive control (bioplacenton). The parameters assessed in this research were wound size and histological assessment. The data were analyzed using ANOVA. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Wound healing percentage and epithelial thickness in the 15% group were the largest (84.17%; 64.69 µm). The lowest value was recorded in placebo (64%; 36.33 µm). Meanwhile, wound healing percentage and epithelial thickness of rats in the 5% and 10% groups were 68.53%, 43,57 µm, and 78.11%, 56.49 µm, respectively. Finally, positive control had a 77.44% wound healing percentage and 49.7 µm epithelial thickness. There were no significant differences in wound healing and epithelial thickness among the groups. Roselle leaf extract at 15% concentration showed greater wound healing properties based on clinical and histological assessment. Although there were no statistically significant differences, roselle leaf showed an opportunity to be further investigated as a potential wound healing therapy.",

Therefore, we aimed to study the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-lowering effects of jelly drink containing polyphenol-rich roselle calyces extract and passion fruit juice with pulp concentrate (RP jelly drink) in comparison to a placebo jelly drink for 8 weeks. Forty-three adults with dyslipidemia were randomly assigned into two groups: the RP jelly drink group and the placebo group. Glucose, total cholesterol (TC) triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), oxidative stress biomarkers, inflammatory parameters, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured with fasting blood samples at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks of intervention. Results showed a significant decrease in LDL-C and TG, respectively, after 8 weeks of RP jelly drink consumption (LDL-C: 107.63 ± 22.98 mg/dL; TG: 109.79 ± 38.83 mg/dL) compared to baseline measurements (LDL-C: 128.43 ± 32.74 mg/dL; TG: 132.33 ± 75.11 mg/dL). These may be possible due to reduced inflammation and improvements in oxidative stress, as demonstrated by the reduction of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α and malondialdehyde (MDA), and the enhancement of glutathione (GSH) after consuming the RP jelly drink for 8 weeks. However, no significant differences of treatment on glucose, total cholesterol, MCP-1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 were observed. In conclusion, daily consumption of RP jelly drink for 8 weeks resulted in significant improvement in lipid profiles in subjects with dyslipidemia. However, more research is needed to assess its nutritional and functional potential.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical effects of roselle drink on antioxidant activity, blood pressure, and skin condition. Roselle drink used in this study contained rich phenolics (1.96 g of gallic acid equivalent/100 ml) and anthocyanins (1.65 g of cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalent/100 ml). In a randomized, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, 39 healthy adults received drank 200 ml of roselle drink or placebo-control drink for 6 months. A significant reduction in the blood pressure was observed in the roselle drink treated group when compared with preintervention values. After 6 months of treatment with roselle drink, serum phenolics contents, the levels of Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione reductase (GSH-Rd) were significantly increased in healthy subjects. However, a significant increment in skin redness and skin moisture was observed in the facial skin of roselle drink-treated participants. Oral administration of roselle drink for 6 months significantly lowered the blood pressure, improved antioxidation level, and positively regulated skin redness as well as moisture. Phenolics and anthocyanins in roselle could be the major potential contributors to such health effects. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Roselle is a typical plant. Continuous administration of roselle drink clearly improved antioxidation levels, reduced blood pressure and positively regulated skin redness and moisture. Phenloics and anthocyanins in roselle could be the major potentila contributors of such health benefits.",

In addition, from calculating competitive indices, it was clear that, the highest land equivalent ratio (abbreviated as LER), area time equivalent ratio (abbreviated as ATER), land utilization efficiency percentage (abbreviated as LUE%) and relative crowding coefficient (abbreviated as RCC) values 1.24 and 1.12, 1.16 and 1.03, 120.57% and 108.06% as well as 0.82 and 0.41 were achieved by the treatment of intercropping pattern of 1 row of roselle alternating with 3 rows of cluster bean during the 1st and 2nd seasons, respectively. The highest values in this concern were achieved with 1: 3 planting pattern combined with 0.0 lithovit rate in the first seasonas well as 1: 2 planting pattern combined with 6.0 g/l lithovit rate in the second one. Also, the highest values of competitive ratio for roselle (Crr) were achieved by combination between 4.0 g/l lithovit rate under 1: 3 pattern, in contrary, the highest values of competitive ratio for cluster bean (Crc) were recorded by combination between 1: 2 pattern with 2.0 g/l lithovit rate in first season. Regardless of the planting patterns combined with different lithovit rates, aggressivity, based on the results, therewas a positive sign for roselle and a negative sign for the intercropped cluster bean, indicating that roselle was dominant, while, cluster bean was dominated."

However, sprout seeds are a major source of sprout contamination and have been linked to most sprout-associated foodborne outbreaks. This study investigated Salmonella reduction in sunflower and roselle seeds using various sanitizing agents including water, water at 55 °C, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), diluted vinegar, acidic electrolyzed water (ACEW), and alkaline electrolyzed water (ALEW). Diluted vinegar containing 1.25% (v/v) acetic acid was the most effective treatment to inactivate Salmonella in sunflower seeds, resulting in a 3.82 log reduction after 15-min treatment. High concentrations of NaOCl (available chlorine concentration (ACC) 1692 mg/L) and ACEW (pH 2.76, oxidation-reduction potential 1093 mV, ACC 48 mg/L) had significantly lower antimicrobial activity with 3.20 and 2.39 log reduction, respectively, after 15-min treatment. Disinfecting roselle seeds for 15 min with water at 55 °C and diluted vinegar had comparable efficacy to reduce Salmonella by 2.54 and 2.48 log, respectively. There were no significant changes in Salmonella reduction among the high and low concentrations of NaOCl containing ACC 79 and 1692 mg/L, respectively, and ACEW in roselle seeds during 5-15 min of exposure time. All tested treatment solutions had no negative impact on the percentage of seed germination with over 96% and 92.56-95.89% for sunflower and roselle seeds, respectively. Conversely, the fresh weight and length of sunflower and roselle sprouts were influenced significantly by the types of sanitizing agents used for decontaminating the seeds. Collectively, our findings may contribute to the development of effective seed sanitization measure for sunflower and roselle seeds to reduce the risk of Salmonella-associated outbreaks linked to sprout consumption.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension is considered to be a serious health problem worldwide. Controlling and lowering blood pressure are of significant benefit to people with hypertension because hypertension is a risk factor for stroke, heart disease, and cardiovascular disease. Roselle, the tropical plant Hibiscus sabdariffa, also commonly called sour tea or red tea, has been used as both a thirst-quenching drink and for medicinal purposes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of Roselle on blood pressure in people with primary hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases and trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCTs): the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (to 6 August 2021), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 5 August 2021), Embase Ovid (1974 to 5 August 2021), ProQuest Dissertations & Theses (to 6 August 2021), Web of Science Clarivate (to 7 August 2021), Food Science and Technology Abstracts Clarivate (to 7 August 2021), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 6 August 2021), and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (to 6 August 2021). We searched Google Scholar and OpenSIGLE. We also handsearched local and regional Chinese databases: CBM, CMCC, TCMLARS, CNKI, CMAC, and the Index to Chinese Periodical Literature (to 14 September 2020), as well as Thai databases (ThaiJO, CUIR, TDC, CMU e-Theses, TCTR) (to 3 October 2020). There were no language or publication date restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought RCTs evaluating the use of any forms of Roselle with placebo or no treatment in adults with hypertension. Our primary outcome was change in trough and/or peak systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP). Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to adverse effects, change in pulse pressure, and change in heart rate. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All search results were managed using Covidence and re-checked for the number of records, inclusion and exclusion of studies with Mendeley reference management software. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors worked independently in parallel for screening (titles and abstracts, and full reports), data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and assessment of the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consultation with the third review author if necessary. We presented mean difference (MD) of change in SBP and DBP with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). MAIN RESULTS: For this update, only one RCT with a parallel-group design involving 60 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This study investigated the effect of Roselle extract capsules (total dose of 5600 mg) compared with placebo (lactose) at eight weeks. The study was at low risk of selection bias, performance bias, and detection bias. Conversely, it was at high risk of attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias (baseline imbalance). We have very little confidence in the effect estimate of Roselle on change-from-baseline in both SBP and DBP between the two groups. The MD of change in SBP was 1.65, 95% CI -7.89 to 11.19 mmHg, 52 participants, very low-certainty evidence. The MD of change in DBP was 4.60, 95% CI -1.38 to 10.58 mmHg, 52 participants, very low-certainty evidence. Our secondary outcomes of withdrawals due to adverse effects, change in pulse pressure, and change in heart rate were not reported. Due to the limited available data, no secondary analyses were performed (subgroup and sensitivity analysis). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is currently insufficient to determine the effectiveness of Roselle compared to placebo for controlling or lowering blood pressure in people with hypertension. The certainty of evidence was very low due to methodological limitations, imprecision, and indirectness. There is a need for rigorous RCTs that address the review question.",

      "abstract": "The calyx of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) has been the focus of attention of several studies, and although earlier studies on this plant showed it to possess antilipidemic and antidiabetic activities, none of these studies have assessed the effects of this plant on the physiological parameters of healthy subjects. The present study determined the effects of roselle calyx beverages on blood pressure, abdominal circumference, body mass index (BMI), hematological and urinary parameters, and the lipid profile of healthy subjects. Healthy subjects (n=30) were treated with a 200 ml roselle calyx beverage each morning and evening for 30 consecutive days. Every week the subjects were asked to perform some physical activity by following the Young Men's Christian Association step test. This study used a pre-post quasi-experimental design. Blood samples were taken before (day-0) and after the intervention (day-30). There was an increase in the levels of high-density lipoproteins (from 47.0 to 49.5 mg/dl; P=0.015), and a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic (P=0.036 and P=0.030, respectively), and the abdominal circumference of the subjects (P=0.005). However, total cholesterol levels (191.2 to 191.9 mg/dl; P=0.821) and low-density lipoprotein levels (129.8 to 133.5 mg/dl; P=0.249) were slightly increased, although not significantly. A lower level of triglycerides (114.3 to 107.4 mg/dl; P=0.269) and very-low-density lipoprotein levels (22.8 to 21.4 mg/dl; P=0.681) was observed. No significant differences were detected in the BMI or the urinalysis parameters were identified. Based on these results, roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) may be used as a supplement to prospectively improve the health status of subjects. No serious adverse effects were observed during this trial."

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Using a microwave-assisted synthesis method, silver​ nanoparticles (SNPs) were prepared from a silver nitrate solution and roselle extract as a reducing and capping agent. Then, SNP-Ro chips were fabricated by mixing a solution of SNP-Ro with alginate gel. The antimicrobial effect of the synthesized SNP-Ro chips was performed by the disc diffusion technique and time kill assay. The cytotoxic effect was also determined by the MTS assay. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe's method were used to analyze the data for this experiment. RESULTS:  All three ratios of the SNP-Ro chip produced inhibition zones ranging between 18.75 ± 2.08 and 19.03 ± 2.25 mm. In studying the killing time, the three groups of the SNP-Ro chips completely eradicated A. actinomycetemcomitans within 180 minutes. The percentage of the viable SNP-Ro chip-treated human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were significantly increased when compared with the alginate chip-treated cells (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION:  This study developed a new method for the deposition of SNPs in alginate gel to make a thin small chip for the sustained release of the SNPs in a periodontal lesion. Therefore, the SNP-Ro chip has the potential to be developed as an adjunctive locally delivered antimicrobial agent in periodontal therapy."

We review the literature and suggest a rational explanation for divergent findings. When used without oxidation and mordanting, roselle is an indiscriminate oversight stain. With appropriate oxidation and mordanting, roselle can be an effective nuclear stain. We propose here use of a stain that is formulated rationally and followed by treatment in a differentiating solution that also acts as a counterstain. We also offer suggestions for improving roselle for the general scientific community.",

Methods This study was conducted in two phases. For the first phase, five DSS-induced colitis mice were sacrificed (group 1) and compared with six healthy mice (group 2) after five-cycle induction (70 days). For the second phase, roselle-treated DSS-induced colitis mice were sacrificed on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 after induction and compared with mesalazine-treated DSS-induced colitis mice. Expressions of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 were determined by immunohistochemistry and HCIS were assessed by two experienced pathologists. Results The expressions of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10, and HCIS in DSS-induced colitis mice were increased compared with control. The expressions of IL-6, TNF-α were significantly higher in roselle-treated group on day 7 and 14, but not on day 21 and 28, whereas, the expression of IL-10 was significantly lower only on day 7 compared with mesalazine-treated group. The inflammation was higher in roselle-treated group assessed by using HCIS. Compared to day 0, the reduction of HCIS was significant in roselle-treated and mesalazine-treated groups. Conclusion Roselle flower petal can attenuate the inflammation in DSS-induced colitis in mice. The extract of roselle can be given as an adjuvant therapy to the first-line therapy to enhance anti-inflammatory effect by increasing expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

However, it remains unclear whether roselle can be used for management of cardiac hypertrophy seen after myocardial infarction (MI). This study therefore investigated the effects of aqueous roselle extract on cardiac hypertrophy arising from myocardial infarction both in vivo and in vitro. For in vivo study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control or MI groups (receiving 85 mg/kg isoproterenol s.c. for 2 days) and were given roselle extract (100 mg/kg, p.o daily) for 28 days. Cardiac structure and functional changes were evaluated at study end-point using histology, Langendorff analysis and gene expression analysis. In vitro effects of roselle were also assessed on ANG II-induced cardiomyocytes hypertrophy using H9c2 cells, simulating cardiac hypertrophy evident after MI. Roselle significantly ameliorated MI-induced cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction, as seen across improvement in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and its derivative (LVdP/dtmax) and isovolumic relaxation (Tau). Oxidative stress evident across elevated pro-oxidant markers (NOX2 subunit of NADPH oxidase and 8-isoprostane) as well as reduced antioxidant markers (superoxide dismutase and glutathione) were also significantly attenuated by roselle. Furthermore, roselle treatment markedly reduced markers of cardiac remodeling (cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis) compared to the untreated MI rats. On in vitro analysis, roselle significantly attenuated ANG II-induced cardiomyoycte hypertrophy in dose-dependent manner. This study demonstrated that roselle attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction seen after MI both in vivo and in vitro, and these effects are likely mediated by phenolic compounds found in roselle extract."

      "abstract": "Heart failure-associated morbidity and mortality is largely attributable to extensive and unregulated cardiac remodelling. Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) calyces are enriched with natural polyphenols known for antioxidant and anti-hypertensive effects, yet its effects on early cardiac remodelling in post myocardial infarction (MI) setting are still unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the actions of roselle extract on cardiac remodelling in rat model of MI. Male Wistar rats (200-300 g) were randomly allotted into three groups: Control, MI, and MI + Roselle. MI was induced with isoprenaline (ISO) (85 mg/kg, s.c) for two consecutive days followed by roselle treatment (100 mg/kg, orally) for 7 days. Isoprenaline administration showed changes in heart weight to body weight (HW/BW) ratio. MI was especially evident by the elevated cardiac injury marker, troponin-T, and histological observation. Upregulation of plasma levels and cardiac gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 was seen in MI rats. A relatively high percentage of fibrosis was observed in rat heart tissues with over-expression of collagen (Col)-1 and Col-3 genes following isoprenaline-induced MI. On top of that, cardiomyocyte areas were larger in heart tissues of MI rats with upregulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene expression, indicating cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, roselle supplementation attenuated elevation of plasma troponin-T, IL-6, IL10, and gene expression level of IL-10. Furthermore, reduction of cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy were observed. In conclusion, roselle treatment was able to limit early cardiac remodelling in MI rat model by alleviating inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy; hence, the potential application of roselle in early adjunctive treatment to prevent heart failure.",

      "abstract": "Roselle is rich in anthocyanins and is traditionally used to prepare a bright red beverage by decoction. However, heat treatment and different pH environments are often encountered during food processing, and these factors are often detrimental to anthocyanins. Therefore, it is very important to understand the influence of pH and heat treatment on anthocyanins for the application of roselle. This study determined the antioxidant properties of roselle extract, explored changes in the color and anthocyanin content in different pH environments, and evaluated the thermal stability of roselle anthocyanins using kinetic equations. The results showed that the roselle extract is rich in anthocyanins and has good antioxidant capacity (DPPH IC50 = 4.06 mg/mL, ABTS IC50 = 3.7 mg/mL). The anthocyanins themselves exhibited a certain degree of heat resistance and good color stability in an acidic environment. In contrast, they degraded very quickly and exhibited significant changes in color in a low-acid environment. The activation energy (Ea) ranges of the anthocyanins in the acidic and low-acid environments were quite different at 55.8⁻95.7 and 31.4⁻74.9 kJ/mol, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that roselle anthocyanins are susceptible to heat treatment in a low-acid environment, affecting their quality and appearance; however, they can serve as a good source of functional ingredients and color in an acidic environment.",

Rats received L-NAME (50 mg/kg/day, orally) for 4 weeks. Concurrent treatment with Roselle-Olive (500, 250, and 125 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, reversed the L-NAME-induced suppression in serum nitric oxide (NO), and improved liver and kidney markers, lipid profile, and oxidative status. Furthermore, Roselle-Olive significantly lowered the elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (ACE) and showed a marked genoprotective effect against oxidative DNA damage in hypertensive rats. Roselle-Olive ameliorated kidney and heart lesions and reduced aortic media thickness. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry showed an enhanced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene and protein expression in both heart and kidney of Roselle-Olive-treated rats. To conclude, our data revealed that Roselle-Olive is an effective combination in which H. sabdariffa and O. europaea synergistically act to control hypertension. These effects are likely to be mediated by antioxidant and genoprotective actions, ACE inhibition, and eNOS upregulation by Roselle-Olive constituents. These findings provide evidences that Roselle-Olive combination affords efficient antihypertensive effect with a broad end-organ protective influence.",

The physicochemical and morphological characteristics, elemental composition, size distribution, crystallinity and thermal properties of the obtained MCC were analyzed in this work. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis provided clear evidence that the characteristic peak of lignin was absent in the spectrum of the MCC prepared from roselle fiber. Rough surface and slight aggregation of MCC were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that pure MCC with small quantities of residues and impurities was obtained, with a similar elemental composition to that of commercial MCC. A mean diameter of approximately 44.28μm was measured for MCC by using a particle size analyzer (PSA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed the crystallinity increased from 63% in roselle pulp to 78% in roselle MCC, the latter having a slightly higher crystallinity than that of commercial MCC (74%). TGA and DSC results indicated that the roselle MCC had better thermal stability than the roselle pulp, whereas it had poorer thermal stability in comparison with commercial MCC. Thus, the isolated MCC from roselle fibers will be going to use as reinforcing element in green composites and may be a precursor for future roselle derived nanocellulose, and thus a promising subject in nanocomposite research.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The complex series of deleterious events among diabetes patients leads to multiple organ failure. Therefore, a holistic approach of treatment is urgently required to prevent worsening of complications. The present investigation was carried out to study the possible protective effects of Roselle or Hibiscus sabdariffa Linn (HSL) calyxes aqueous extract, as an antidiabetic and antioxidant agent against oxidative liver injury in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single dose of streptozotocin (45mg/kg body weight, iv) was used to induced diabetes in male Sprague Dawley rats which were then divided into two groups: Diabetic control (DC) and HSL-treated diabetic (DR) group. Normal rats were divided into normal control (NC), HSL-treated control (NR). Aqueous calyxes extract of HSL (100mg/kg/day, orally) was given for 28 consecutive days in the treated group. Weight, biochemical and histopathological (light and electron microscopic) parameters were compared in all groups. RESULTS: Supplementation of HSL significantly lowered the level of fasting blood glucose and increased plasma insulin level in DR group compared to DC group (p<0.05). Alanine aminotransaminases and aspartate aminotransferase enzymes level were found to be significantly reduced in DR compared to DC. Microscopic examination demonstrated destruction of the liver architecture, cytoplasmic vacuolation of the hepatocytes and signs of necrosis in diabetic rats. Moreover, dilatation and congestion of blood vessels with leucocytes adherence were detected. Ultrastructural study using electron microscope showed homogeneous substance accumulation in nuclear chromatin, a decrease of organelles and mitochondrial degeneration in the diabetic rats. CONCLUSION: Administration of HSL in diabetic rats causes significant decrease in hepatocyte destruction and prevented the changes associated with the diabetic condition. Thus, our findings provide a scientific rationale for the use of HSL as promising agent in preventing liver injury in diabetes.",

However, these peppers have been associated with Salmonella infection outbreaks in the United States, and Salmonella and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli pathotypes have been isolated from jalapeño and serrano peppers in Mexico. To decrease microbial contamination of fruits and vegetables, chemical agents are commonly used; however, chemical agents used to eliminate pathogenic bacteria on vegetables have a limited antimicrobial effect. Roselle ( Hibiscus sabdariffa ) calyces have been reported to have an antimicrobial effect on pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, the antibacterial effect of four roselle calyx extracts (water, methanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate), sodium hypochlorite, colloidal silver, and acetic acid against foodborne bacteria was evaluated on contaminated jalapeño and serrano peppers. The 13 types of foodborne bacteria evaluated were Listeria monocytogenes , Shigella flexneri , Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Montevideo, Staphylococcus aureus , E. coli O157:H7, five E. coli pathotypes (Shiga toxin producing, enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, enteroinvasive, and enteroaggregative), and Vibrio cholerae O1. All 13 types attached to both pepper types, with no significant differences in attachment between jalapeño and serrano peppers. Roselle calyx extract treatment resulted in a greater reduction in levels of all foodborne bacteria than did treatment with sodium hypochlorite, colloidal silver, and acetic acid on both pepper types. Roselle calyx extracts may be a useful for disinfection of chili peppers in the field, processing plants, restaurants, and homes.",

In the present study, we investigated the effect of Hibiscus anthocyanins (HAs) on cell cycle arrest in human leukemia cell line HL-60 and the analyzed the underlying molecular mechanisms. HAs extracted from roselle calyces (purity 90%) markedly induced G2/M arrest evaluated with flow cytometry analysis. Western blot analyses revealed that HAs (0.1-0.7 mg mL-1 ) induced G2/M arrest via increasing Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdc2, and inducing Cdk inhibitors p27 and p21. HAs also induced phosphorylation of upstream signals related to G2/M arrest such as phosphorylation of Cdc25C tyrosine phosphatase at Ser216, increasing the binding of pCdc25C with 14-3-3 protein. HAs-induced phosphorylation of Cdc25C could be activated by ATM checkpoint kinases, Chk1, and Chk2. We first time confirmed that ATM-Chk1/2-Cdc25C pathway as a critical mechanism for G2/M arrest in HAs-induced leukemia cell cycle arrest, indicating that this compound could be a promising anticancer candidate or chemopreventive agents for further investigation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Aqueous extract of Roselle was added at varying concentrations (0-1000 ng/mL) for 24 hours to the freshly isolated murine bone marrow cells (BMCs) cultures. Effects of Roselle on cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, glutathione (GSH) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and DNA damage were investigated. Roselle enhanced the survival (P < 0.05) of BMCs at 500 and 1000 ng/mL, increased survival of Sca-1(+) cells (HSCs) at 500 ng/mL, and maintained HSCs phenotype as shown from nonremarkable changes of surface marker antigen (Sca-1) expression in all experimental groups. Roselle increased (P < 0.05) the GSH level and SOD activity but the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was unaffected. Moreover, Roselle showed significant cellular genoprotective potency against H2O2-induced DNA damage. Conclusively, Roselle shows novel property as potential supplement and genoprotectant against oxidative damage to cultured HSCs.",

METHODS: This non-randomized quasi-experimental study was conducted in Kafr El-Shaikh, Egypt, for 8 weeks, from September 2012 to November 2012. The effects of a 4-week period of regular Roselle ingestion followed by a 4-week recovery period on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), and heart rates (HR) was studied in 2 equal, gender- and age-matched groups (n=50 each; average age - 50+/-5 years) of normotensive subjects, and patients with moderate essential hypertension. Electrocardiographic assessments of LVH were also made prior to, and at the end of both treatment and recovery periods. RESULTS: Pulse pressure (PP) significantly fell from baseline values by 10.9% (normotensive group [NG]), 21.2% (hypertensive group [HG]); SBP by 10% (NG), 19.6% (HG); DBP by 9.5% (NG), 18.7% (HG), and HR by 14.6% (NG), 17.1% (HG) by the end of week 4 of treatment. Following treatment cessation, SBP, DBP, PP, and HR returned to pretreatment levels over 4 weeks. Before intervention, none of the normotensive subjects, but 14 hypertensive patients showed LVH. However, Roselle treatment was associated with regression of LVH in 10 patients with only 4 patients showing LVH after 4 weeks of treatment. This became 10 patients 4 weeks after ceasing treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings empirically suggest favorable cardiovascular effects of Roselle in patients with established moderate essential hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. Its calyxes are rich in vitamin C and anthocyanins and are used to make roselle drink and hibiscus tea. Roselles are grown in counties of Taitung, Pingtung, and Chiayi in Taiwan. In addition to a few local cultivars, the major cultivar currently grown in Taiwan is Roselle cv. Victor. In April of 2012, a wilt disease appeared on seedlings of a cultivar, Chiada 1, at the Chungpu Township of Chiayi County. Mature plants were free from this disease. Leaves appeared weak and drooping when they were still green, followed by collapse of the whole plant a few days later. Browning of vascular and pith tissues was evident, especially at the base of the stem. A whitish mass of bacteria oozed from the cut end of diseased stems, suggesting that bacteria might be the cause of this disease. A total of 15 bacterial strains were collected. Colonies on tetrazolium chloride medium (3) were round to oval and fluidal, each with a pink or red center after incubation at 30°C for 48 h. When tobacco leaves were infiltrated with these strains, a hypersensitive reaction (HR) typical of phytopathogenic bacteria was induced. All strains produced the expected amplicon (282 bp) after PCR with the Ralstonia solanacearum-specific primer pair, AU759f and AU760r (4). Three hexose alcohols (mannitol, sorbitol, and dulcitol), rather than three disaccharides (lactose, maltose, and cellobiose), were utilized, which suggests R. solanacearum biovar 4 (2). R. solanacearum phylotype I was determined by phylotype-specific multiplex PCR (1). Pathogenicity of the strains was tested on roselle, tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Young plants of the various species were inoculated at the four- to six-leaf stage by soil drenching with 30 ml of bacterial suspension (about 108 CFU/ml). Control plants were inoculated with sterile water. Each treatment comprised eight plants with a single plant in each pot. Plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 25 to 31°C and 56 to 93% humidity. Wilting was observed 4 to 6 days after inoculation, while the control did not wilt. To find the correlation between plant growth stage and resistance to the pathogen, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-week-old roselle plants cv. Chiada 1 were transplanted into artificially infested soil. Eight plants in each treatment were planted with a single plant in each pot. The disease incidences for plants of different ages were 75%, 62.5%, 50%, and 12.5%, respectively. This study showed that resistance increases with plant age. Hence, if older seedlings are transplanted, the risk of bacterial wilt of roselle can be reduced. To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. solanacearum on roselle in Taiwan. References: (1) M. Fegan and P. Prior.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Our recent study revealed the antihyperglycemic activity of an ethanolic extract of roselle calyxes (Hibiscus sabdariffa) in diabetic rats. The present study had, therefore, an objective to investigate the mechanism underlying this activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were induced to be diabetes by intraperitoneal injection of 45 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). Normal rats as well as diabetic rats were administered with the ethanolic extract of H. sabdariffa calyxes (HS-EE) at 0.1 and 1.0 g/kg/day, respectively, for 6 weeks. Then, blood glucose and insulin levels, at basal and glucose-stimulated secretions, were measured. The pancreas was dissected to examine histologically. RESULTS: HS-EE 1.0 g/kg/day significantly decreased the blood glucose level by 38 ± 12% in diabetic rats but not in normal rats. In normal rats, treatment with 1.0 g/kg HS-EE increased the basal insulin level significantly as compared with control normal rats (1.28 ± 0.25 and 0.55 ± 0.05 ng/ml, respectively). Interestingly, diabetic rats treated with 1.0 g/kg HS-EE also showed a significant increase in basal insulin level as compared with the control diabetic rats (0.30 ± 0.05 and 0.15 ± 0.01 ng/ml, respectively). Concerning microscopic histological examination, HS-EE 1.0 g/kg significantly increased the number of islets of Langerhans in both normal rats (1.2 ± 0.1 and 2.0 ± 0.1 islet number/10 low-power fields (LPF) for control and HS-EE treated group, respectively) and diabetic rats (1.0 ± 0.3 and 3.9 ± 0.6 islet number/10 LPF for control and HS-EE treated group, respectively). CONCLUSION: The antidiabetic activity of HS-EE may be partially mediated via the stimulating effect on insulin secretion."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension is considered a serious health problem worldwide. Controlling and lowering blood pressure have a significant benefit to the hypertensive patients because hypertension is a risk factor for stroke, heart disease and cardiovascular disease. A tropical plant called Roselle, or Red Sorrel in English-speaking countries, has been used both as a thirst-quenching drink and for medical purposes. OBJECTIVES: To explore the effect of Roselle on blood pressure in hypertensive adult patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched (Date of most recent search was September 2009): - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2nd Quarter 2009) - DARE (2nd Quarter 2009) - Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to Present with Daily Update) - EMBASE (1980 to 2009 Week 22) - AMED (1985 to May 2009) - EBSCO CINAHL - BIOSIS (1969 to 2008) - AGRICOLA (1970 to May 2009) - Food Science and Technology Abstract (1969 to 2009 June Week 1) - International Pharmaceutical Abstracts - International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements - Clinical Trials.gov and Current Controlled Trials - OpenSIGLE - Hand searching of journals - ISI Web of Knowledge SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought randomised control trials (RCTs) evaluating use of any forms of Roselle with placebo or no treatment in hypertensive patients. Change in trough and/or peak systolic and diastolic blood pressure were primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to adverse effects, change of pulse pressure and change of heart rate. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (C Ngamjarus, CN and P Pattanittum, PP) independently scanned titles and abstracts, as well as independently screened the full reports of the potentially relevant studies. At each stage, the results were compared and disagreements were solved by discussion. MAIN RESULTS: No studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. However, one abstract of an ongoing study is likely to meet the inclusion criteria, when completed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support the benefit of Roselle for either controlling or lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Based on the information of this review, there is a clear need to develop well-designed studies to assess the efficacy of Roselle on hypertensive patients.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the protective effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa (Roselle) and Zingiber officinale (Ginger) against cisplatin-induced reproductive toxicity in rats and to study the mechanisms underlying these effects. METHODS: Ethanol extracts of H.sabdariffa or Z.officinale (1g/kg x day) were given p.o. to male albino rats for 26 days, which began 21 days before a single cisplatin i.p. injection (10 mg/kg body weight). RESULTS: Extracts of H.sabdariffa and Z.officinale reduced the extent of cisplatin-induced sperm abnormality and enhanced sperm motility. Both extracts restored the control level of malondialdehyde (MDA) (lipid peroxidation marker) in the cisplatin-treated testis. The cisplatin injection induced decline in the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) were significantly reversed to control levels in groups where cisplatin was preceded by the administration of either H.sabdariffa or Z.officinale. CONCLUSION: Both H.sabdariffa and Z.officinale treatment increased the activities of testicular antioxidant enzymes and restored sperm motility of cisplatin-treated rats. The protective effects of tested plants are, therefore, suggested to be mediated by their potent antioxidant activities.",

The data from inhibition zone and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values showed that both roselle calyx extract and protocatechuic acid inhibited effectively the growth of all test bacterial pathogens, the antibacterial activity of protocatechuic acid being significantly greater than roselle calyx (p < 0.05). Furthermore, heat treatment did not affect the antibacterial activity of roselle calyx and protocatechuic acid against all test pathogens. The time-kill data from protocatechuic acid showed this agent provided concentration dependent antibacterial activities in broth and human plasma (p < 0.05); however, protocatechuic acid showed less inhibitory activity in human plasma than in broth (p < 0.05). These agents based on their lower MIC values, heat tolerance and concentration dependent antibacterial activity may be useful in clinical infection prevention or therapy.",

      "abstract": "The 80% ethanol extract of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa Linn.), a medicinal plant in Thailand, was examined for antimutagenic and chemopreventive activity in a colon carcinogenesis model. It reduced about 60-90% of the mutagenicity induced by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and other heterocyclic amines 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline(MelQ),2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline(MelQx),3-amino-1,4-dimet hyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2),2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1),2-aminodipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-2), at a concentration of 12.5 mg/plate in the Salmonella mutation assay. The extract showed no mutagenicity and no antibacterial activity below this dose. Mutagenicity of methylazoxymethanol (MAM) acetate, which, like PhIP, is a colon carcinogen,was also efficiently inhibited by the roselle extract. To investigate chemoprevention by roselle in a colon carcinogenesis model, we examined the inhibitory effects of the roselle extract in F344 rats in which aberrant crypt focus (ACF) formation was induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and PhIP. In the initiation stage, the number of AOM-induced ACF in the colon was significantly decreased by roselle (17-25%) compared with that in rats treated with AOM alone. The amount of O6-methylguanine in the colonic mucosa tended to be decreased in the roselle-treated rats. The number of PhIP-induced ACF was also significantly decreased by roselle treatment (22%) at a concentration of 1.0 g/kg body weight in the initiation stage. However, in the post-initiation stage of AOM-induced ACF formation, roselle increased the number of ACF, especially the number of foci which had more than three crypts/focus. These results indicate that roselle has antimutagenic activity against MAM acetate and heterocyclic amines and that it decreases the number of AOM- and PhIP-induced ACF in the initiation stage, although it rather increased the number of ACF in the post-initiation stage.",

Thirty-six healthy men participated in the study, in which urinalysis, urine electrolytes and indices for measurements of concentration of urine were determined before, during and after roselle juice consumption. The urine after consumption of roselle juice showed a decrease of creatinine, uric acid, citrate, tartrate, calcium, sodium, potassium and phosphate but not oxalate in urinary excretion. The CPR values of the majority of each individual increased and means PI values decreased in phase 1. Contrarily, the CPR values of the majority of volunteers decreased and means PI values increased in phase 2. In conclusion a low dose of roselle juice (16 g/day) caused more significant decrease in salt output in the urine than a high dose (24 g/day). The urinary changes were similar to the observations on villagers with and without stones in northeastern Thailand.",
