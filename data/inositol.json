      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The combination of lifestyle changes and nutraceuticals, such as inositols, can reduce excess weight, leading to a reduction in insulin resistance and a normalization of the metabolic profile. As such, this study investigated the metabolic and hormonal changes observed in women who were overweight/obese with insulin resistance undergoing a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet combined with high-dose D-chiro-inositol (DCI) treatment. METHODS: In total, 48 insulin-resistant women between 25 and 40 years old, with a body mass index (BMI) between 26 and 32 were divided into two groups: both groups followed a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet for 4 months, and patients in the treated group also underwent treatment with 2400 mg/day of DCI for the same period. We evaluated the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, body weight, BMI, blood glucose, fasting insulin, lipid profile [cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides] and hormonal profile [total testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and menstrual length] at baseline and at the end of treatment. RESULTS: After 4 months, both groups displayed a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity, as reflected by a reduction in the HOMA index, blood glucose level, fasting insulin level, and lipid profile. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in body weight and BMI in both groups. However, the evaluation of the hormonal profiles revealed unexpected findings, with the DCI-supplemented group exhibiting hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity, as demonstrated by the significant increase of total testosterone, androstenedione, LH, and menstrual length. CONCLUSION: The study strengthens the evidence regarding the metabolic benefits of the hypocaloric Mediterranean diet, independent from the association with DCI, on women with insulin resistance and excess weight, while also acknowledging the complex hormonal impact of high-dose DCI supplementation for medium-to-long periods.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endometriosis, a common condition affecting 5-10% of women of reproductive age, is the growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, leading to pain and infertility. Current treatments, such as surgery and hormonal therapy, offer limited long-term benefits. This study investigated the potential of D-chiro inositol (DCI), a natural compound that influences ovarian steroidogenesis, to treat endometriosis and compared its efficacy with a progestin drug such as Dienogest (DG). METHODS: We established a non-surgical mouse model of endometriosis in CD1 mice. Uterine horns were removed from donor mice, cut into fragments and inoculated in recipient mice by intraperitoneal injection. Endometriosis progression was assessed at 15, 21 and 28 days after transplantation, with the 28-day window being the most effective. The mice were then randomly assigned to four experimental groups, which received for 28 days: water (EMS); DCI 0.4 mg/die (DCI); DCI 0.2 mg/die and Dienogest 0.33 ng/die (DCI + DG); DG 0.67 ng/die (DG). At the end of the treatments, endometriotic lesions, ovaries and circulating estradiol levels were analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that treatment with DCI, both alone and in combination with DG, significantly reduced the number, size and vascularization of endometriotic lesions compared to the EMS control group. Histological analysis confirmed a decrease in endometriotic foci across all treatment groups, with the most pronounced effects in the DCI group. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we found that DCI led to a significant reduction in the expression of Sirt1 and an increase in E-Cadherin, indicating a reduction in EMT transition relevant for lesion development. In addition, DCI decreased cell proliferation and,blood vessel formation, as evaluated by PCNA and CD34, respectively. Futhermore, in the ovary, DCI treatment downregulated the expression of aromatase (Cyp19a1), the enzyme critical for estrogen biosynthesis, and increased the number of primordial to antral follicles, suggesting a beneficial effect on ovarian folliculogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: By modulating proliferation, EMT transition and aromatase activity, DCI emerges as a promising compound for endometriosis treatment.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Inositol phosphates are involved in a myriad of biological roles and activities such as Ca2+ signaling, phosphate homeostasis, energy metabolism, and disease pathogenicity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, synthesis of inositol phosphates occurs through the phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PLC)-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol and further IP3 phosphorylation by additional kinases that leads to the formation of highly phosphorylated inositol derivatives, known as inositol pyrophosphates. Inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase (ITPK1) is an enzyme that mediates a PLC-independent inositol polyphosphate synthesis through phosphorylation of inositol monophosphates and other intermediates in the cytosol. In this work, we identified and characterized a Trypanosoma cruzi ITPK1 (TcITPK1) homolog. The ability of TcITPK1 to act as the mediator for this alternative pathway was established through plc1Δ and plc1Δ isc1Δ yeast complementation assays and SAX-HPLC analyses of radioactively labeled inositol. TcITPK1 localizes to the cytosol, and knockout attempts of TcITPK1 revealed that only one allele was replaced by the DNA donor cassette at the specific locus, suggesting that null alleles may have lethal effects in epimastigotes. Ablation of T. cruzi phosphoinositide phospholipase C 1 (TcPI-PLC1) affected the synthesis of IP3 from glucose 6-phosphate but did not affect the synthesis of inositol polyphosphates, while ablation of inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase (TcISC1) affected the synthesis of inositol polyphosphates, thus revealing that the PLC-independent pathway using either glucose 6-phosphate or inositol phosphoceramide is involved in the synthesis of inositol polyphosphates, while the PLC-dependent pathway is involved in IP3 formation needed for Ca2+ signaling. IMPORTANCE: Millions of people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, and the current treatment is not satisfactory. Inositol pyrophosphates have been established as important signaling molecules. Our work demonstrates the presence of a phospholipase C-independent pathway for the synthesis of inositol pyrophosphates in T. cruzi. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this pathway starts with the synthesis of inositol monophosphates from glucose 6-phosphate or from inositol phosphoceramide, linking it to carbohydrate and sphingolipid metabolism. The essentiality of the pathway for the survival of T. cruzi infective stages makes it an ideal drug target for treating American trypanosomiasis."

In the present study, the function of IP3R2 from Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis (PyIP3R2) in regulating the Ca2+-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptosis after high temperature (25 °C) treatment was investigated. Three MIR domains, one RYDR_ITPR domain, one RIH_assoc domain and one Ion_trans domain were identified in PyIP3R2. Both D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3, an activator of IP3R) and high temperature significantly upregulated the mRNA expression level of PyIP3R2 and genes related to apoptosis and the UPR, and also increased intracellular Ca2+ content (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the IP3R antagonist 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB) had the opposite effect, decreasing intracellular Ca2+ content and the mRNA expression level of PyIP3R2, glucose regulated protein 78 (PyGRP78) and PyCaspase-3 (p < 0.05). However, the apoptosis rate and Caspase-3 activity remained comparable to those in the injection control group. These findings indicate that PyIP3R2 mediates UPR and apoptosis in scallop haemocytes by regulating Ca2+content and distribution, and providing insight into the cellular responses of scallops to high temperature."

      "abstract": "Inositol phosphates are critical signaling messengers involved in a wide range of biological pathways, and inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) functions as a rate-limiting enzyme for inositol polyphosphate metabolism. IPMK has been implicated in cellular metabolism, but its function at the systemic level is still poorly understood. Since skeletal muscle is a major contributor to energy homeostasis, we have developed a mouse model in which skeletal muscle IPMK is specifically deleted and examined how a loss of IPMK affects whole-body metabolism. Here, we report that skeletal-muscle-specific IPMK knockout mice exhibited a ~12% increase in body weight compared to WT controls (p < 0.05). These mice also showed a significantly impaired glucose tolerance, as indicated by their ~50% higher blood glucose levels during GTT. Additionally, exercise capacity was reduced by ~45% in IPMK-MKO mice, demonstrating a decline in endurance. Moreover, these metabolic alterations were accompanied by a 2.5-fold increase in skeletal muscle triglyceride accumulation, suggesting impaired lipid metabolism. Further analysis revealed that IPMK-deficient myocytes exhibited 30% lower β-oxidation rates. Thus, our results suggest that IPMK mediates whole-body metabolism by regulating muscle metabolism and may be potentially targeted for the treatment of metabolic syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Neural tube defects (NTDs) are severe congenital anomalies affecting 1-2 infants per 1000 births, and are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, with DNA hypomethylation and methylation cycle suppression being key causes. In our earlier investigation, decitabine (DCT) caused multiple NTDs in embryonic zebrafish, supporting this hypothesis. Recent research has emphasized the importance of myo-inositol (MI) in embryonic development and its efficacy in reducing the risk of neural tube defects, even in cases resistant to folate. We aimed to examine the effect of MI on DCT-induced NTDs in an embryonic zebrafish model. The embryos were exposed to 1 mM DCT alone, 50 µM MI with 1 mM DCT, 100 µM MI with 1 mM DCT, and a control group for comparison. The development, hatching, mortality rates, neural tube malformations, and neural tube patterning of developing embryos were monitored and recorded. Exposure to MI significantly reduced the incidence of NTDs in developing embryos. At concentrations of 50 µM and 100 µM, MI provided 35% and 30% protection against DCT-induced neural tube malformation, respectively. Multiple NTDs were significantly reduced in the MI groups, with 1 mM DCT causing 95% defects, 50 µM MI with 1 mM DCT causing 50%, and 100 µM MI with 1 mM DCT causing 55% defects. The DCT-induced hatching delay was also reversed by MI treatment. Alizarin red staining and histopathological observations supported these observations. In the context of neural tube development, the protective effects of MI against DCT-induced NTDs could be attributed to its potential role in epigenetic regulation, which may influence genetic expression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fertility care represents a financial burden on patients and healthcare services alike and can represent a barrier to entry for many couples. Controlled ovarian stimulation (COH) is routinely used as part of in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures, as such the use of gonadotropins is a major contributing factor to the cost of the procedure. Recent studies have shown that myo-Inositol (myo-ins) may reduce the amount of gonadotrophins required in assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. This retrospective study measured the effect of myo-ins on the number of recombinant follicular stimulating hormone (rFSH) units used in IVF and ICSI and the relative cost to verify if this may be a cost saving strategy. We also investigated the oocyte and embryo quality, implantation rate, abortion rate, clinical pregnancy, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. METHODS: A total of 300 women undergoing either IVF or ICSI were distributed between two distinct and equal patient groups of 150 women. In control group (group A), folic acid (FA) alone was prescribed, meanwhile the treated group (group B) were prescribed FA, myo-Inositol (myo-ins) and alpha-lactalbumin (α-LA), both groups started this oral treatment in the middle of the luteal phase. RESULTS: Myo-Ins supplementation in the treatment group significantly reduced the number of units of rFSH used in COH vs. the control group (2526 vs. 1647, p < 0.05); however, no changes were seen in other measured outcomes, likely due to the short treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The use of myo-Ins presents a safe method for reducing the amount and subsequent costs of rFSH usage in ART protocols. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was retrospectively registered with the Institutional Review Board of ALMA RES IVF Center, trial number n°2/2024."

      "abstract": "Respiratory diseases are major health concerns worldwide. Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are the third leading cause of death worldwide and some of the most common are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, occupational lung diseases, and pulmonary hypertension. Despite having different etiology and characteristics, these diseases share several features, such as a persistent inflammatory state, chronic oxidative stress, impaired mucociliary clearance, and increased alveolar surface tension. CRDs are not curable; however, various forms of treatment, that help restore airway patency and reduce shortness of breath, can improve daily life for people living with these conditions. In this regard myo-inositol may represent a valid therapeutic adjuvant approach due to its properties. Being a redox balancer, an inflammation modulator, and, most importantly, a component of pulmonary surfactant, it may improve lung function and counteract symptoms associated with respiratory diseases, as recently evidenced in patients with COPD, COVID-19, asthma, and bronchiectasis. The aim of this review is to evaluate the potential therapeutic role of myo-inositol supplementation in the management of patients with respiratory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at high risk of developing a hypercoagulable state and thrombosis. The von Willebrand factor (vWF) produced by endothelial cells (ECs) is a critical thrombosis regulator. We previously found that cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4) is a novel receptor for the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 and is involved in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. However, the underlying mechanism involved remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the signaling pathways involved in spike protein-CKAP4-induced vWF secretion and thrombosis. Treatment of ECs with the spike protein significantly induced vWF secretion, coagulation factor VIII (FVIII)-vWF binding, and platelet adhesion to ECs, which were blocked by the selective intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM. Furthermore, using several calcium channel-blocking drugs and small-molecule inhibitors, we found that calcium released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in this process. IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) receptors (IP3Rs) inhibition ameliorated spike protein-induced vWF secretion, FVIII-vWF binding affinity, and platelet adhesion to ECs. Specifically, the knockdown of IP3R1, a crucial type of IP3Rs, reversed spike protein-induced endothelial vWF secretion, and the procoagulant state. Moreover, KT-362, an investigational and clinically relevant antihypertensive drug targeting IP3Rs-mediated calcium release, repressed spike protein-induced endothelial vWF secretion. Conversely, the IP3Rs agonist promoted endothelial vWF secretion, which was not affected by CKAP4 knockdown. In vivo treatment of endothelial-specific human CKAP4 overexpression mice with KT-362 retarded spike protein-induced vWF secretion and thrombosis. Thus, IP3Rs mediated calcium release from the ER and contributed to spike protein-induced vWF secretion and thrombosis, making them potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19-associated coagulopathy."

      "abstract": "Background: Acne is a pathology of the pilosebaceous unit. It is characterized by a highly complex etiopathology which includes inflammation, hyperkeratinization, increased sebum production, colonization of Cutibacterium acne, hyperandrogenemia, and hyperinsulinemia. This condition, together with hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, and acanthosis nigricans, are highly prevalent cutaneous manifestations of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). While conventional therapies represent effective treatment options, they are not free from side effects which may reduce compliance. In this context, considerable attention has been directed toward nutraceutical supplements, which include different molecules with great potential to reduce inflammation, hyperkeratinization, hyperseborrhea, and hyperinsulinemia. Myo-inositol has been shown to be effective in improving some of the signs and symptoms of patients with microcystic ovaries: reducing body mass index (BMI), testosterone free levels, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels, and improving ovarian function and insulin sensitivity. Methods: The authors conducted a retrospective study that included 200 patients suffering from PCOS. Over 6 months, they analyzed the effects of the supplementation of LEVIGON™ (Sanitpharma; Milan, Italy)-a specific nutraceutical formulation containing myo-inositol, microlipodispersed magnesium, and folic acid-on the clinical picture of acne and hirsutism. Results: The supplementation of LEVIGON™ showed a significant reduction of BMI, testosterone, testosterone free, and DHEAS levels, thus improving the clinical picture of acne and hirsutism. Moreover, the impact of acne on the quality of life, assessed using the Cardiff Acne Disability Index (CADI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scale, improved significantly after 3 and 6 months. Women with hirsutism benefited also from a significant improvement of the Ferriman-Gallwey score after both 3 and 6 months (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001 respectively compared to the baseline). Conclusions: Myo-inositol supplementation, associated with microlipodispersed magnesium in a bioaccessible form, proved to be extremely useful in reducing acne and hirsutism in patients suffering from microcystic ovaries. In addition, there were no side effects, thus confirming excellent compliance. Further long-term randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm this preliminary evidence."

While emerging research has highlighted the significant roles of inositol phosphates in immunity, cancer, and metabolic diseases, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on their roles in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This review aims to fill that gap by analyzing the existing literature on the importance of inositol phosphates in severe psychiatric and neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, schizophrenia, and Huntington's disease, underscoring the potential to pave the way for new treatment regimens for these debilitating disorders targeting inositol pathways.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation, often induced by elevated circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, is a common consequence of intestinal epithelial barrier damage and microbial translocation. This condition is particularly prevalent in menopausal women, who are at increased risk for chronic inflammation and metabolic syndrome due to physiological changes during menopause. Myo-inositol has been shown to improve metabolic profiles in menopausal women with metabolic syndrome. In this study, we investigated whether small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from human palatine tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) can restore circulating myo-inositol levels and promote myo-inositol synthesis in skeletal muscle under repeated LPS exposure, mimicking the intestinal leakage seen in menopausal women. METHODS: Over 2 weeks period, LPS was repeatedly administered to mice, along with a group that also received T-MSC-derived sEVs. After 15 days, the expression of proteins involved in inositol synthesis in skeletal muscle, and serum inositol levels were measured. Additionally, intracellular inositol expression was compared in LPS-treated skeletal muscle cells with and without T-MSC sEVs treatment in vitro. Lastly, the protein and microRNA composition of T-MSC sEVs was analyzed. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that T-MSC-derived sEVs significantly increased serum myo-inositol levels and enhanced the expression of myo-inositol synthesis proteins in mice exposed to LPS. Similarly, LPS-treated myotubes supplemented with T-MSC sEVs exhibited restored myo-inositol expression. Moreover, T-MSC sEVs were found to contain high levels of muscle-related proteins. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that T-MSC sEVs may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating the effects of intestinal leakage and chronic inflammation in menopausal women. By improving skeletal muscle mass and maintaining myo-inositol levels, T-MSC sEVs offer potential for addressing metabolic disturbances associated with menopause.",

The condition develops as a potentially fatal illness during the newborn period, but its acute clinical manifestations can be alleviated through a galactose restricted diet. Nonetheless, such dietary intervention is inadequate in preventing significant long-term consequences, including neurological impairments, growth restriction, cognitive delays, and, for most females, primary ovarian insufficiency. At present, no effective therapy exists to stop the progression of these complications, highlighting the urgent need for new treatment approaches to be developed. Supplements have been used in the treatment of other inborn errors of metabolism; however, they are not typically included in the clinical therapeutic regimen for CG. Recently, our research team has demonstrated that two generally recognized as safe supplements (purple weet potato color, PSPC and myo-inositol, MI) have been effective in partially restoring functions in the ovaries of our GalT-KO mouse model. However, the toxicological profile of both PSPC and MI has not been determined. In this study, we investigated the acute (30 days) and chronic (180 days) oral toxicities of PSPC and MI both in WT control and GalT-KO mice. Furthermore, our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of oral feeding of PSPC and MI in correcting motor-related and behavioral phenotypes in GalT-KO mice. The long-term treatment of MI at a lower dose demonstrated promising improvements in motor deficit and anxiety driven hyperactivity in the mutant mice.",

METHODS: This was a retrospective study analyzing information of a group of PCOS (n = 25) overweight/obesity patients, not requiring hormonal treatment, selected from the database of the ambulatory clinic of the Gynecological Endocrinology Center at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy. The hormonal profile, routine exams and insulin and C-peptide response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of a daily oral complementary treatment with L-carnitine (500 mg), acetyl-L-carnitine (250 mg), L-arginine (500 mg), L-cysteine (100 mg) and myo-inositol (1 gr). The hepatic insulin extraction index was also calculated. RESULTS: The mix of complementary substances significantly improved metabolic parameters, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index values and gonadotropin plasma levels. Glucose, C-peptide and insulin response to OGTT was significantly reduced as well as the hepatic insulin extraction index. CONCLUSION: The administration of a combination of carnitines, L-arginine, L-cysteine and myoinositol improved gonadotropin plasma levels and insulin sensitivity in overweight/obese PCOS patients and restored hepatic clearance of insulin as demonstrated by the decreased hepatic insulin extraction index.",

      "abstract": "Background: Myo-inositol plays a vital role in human health, functioning as a second messenger of FSH and facilitating the transport of glucose into the cell. Consequently, myo-inositol is regularly utilized in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), wherein it acts upon metabolic factors, improving insulin sensitivity and reducing total androgen levels. Patients with PCOS frequently suffer from infertility; thus, the use of myo-inositol has been explored in improving assistive reproductive technique (ART) procedures. This is by no means limited to patients with PCOS, as inositol has found applications in non-PCOS patient groups in addition to in male factor infertility. This joint statement from the Experts Group on Inositol in Basic and Clinical Research and on PCOS (EGOI-PCOS), the Polish Society of Andrology, and the International Scientific Association for the Support and Development of Medical Technologies discusses the latest evidence on this topic, with the aim of interrogating whether myo-inositol could be implemented in everyday ART patient care. Methods: The authors conducted a narrative review performed via an independent literature search between July and August 2024, using the search platforms PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Results: In both non-PCOS and PCOS populations seeking IVF care, MI supplementation prior to ovarian stimulation may positively affect gonadotropin use and duration, oocyte and embryo quality, fertilization, and clinical pregnancy rates. Conclusions: This position statement recommends that myo-inositol be considered as a potential pretreatment strategy prior to ovarian hyperstimulation with gonadotropins."

Women with PCOS were identified using the Androgen Excess Society's criteria, and 60 participants were enrolled and divided equally into two groups. One group received a 40:1 ratio of MI plus DCI, while the other received metformin for a 12-week period. Endocrine and metabolic parameters, insulin-resistance, stress levels, and quality of life were assessed pre- and post-treatment. Both MI plus DCI and metformin significantly improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, p < 0.001), SHBG levels (p = 0.021), ovarian volume (p < 0.001), and menstrual regularity (p = 0.002), along with BMI, quality of life, and PSS scores (p < 0.001). Metformin showed slightly better outcomes in certain parameters, such as insulin sensitivity and endocrine markers, probably due to a higher representation of Phenotype A. In contrast, we hypothesize that MI plus DCI may be more effective for Phenotypes C and D. Our findings support both MI plus DCI and metformin as effective treatments for PCOS, with each treatment offering specific benefits. These results highlight the potential for a phenotype-specific tailored therapeutic approach to better manage the complex metabolic, endocrine, and stress-related challenges of PCOS.

Hypoxia first activates pro-angiogenic signals for alleviation. Pathologic, tumour angiogenesis maintains hypoxia, impairing treatment outcomes. Vessel normalisation requires physioxia. Oxygen delivery by red blood cell (RBC) carrying haemoglobin (Hb) is enhanced by myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP), an effector of oxygen transport by RBCs. Altering glycolytic activity, it lowers intracellular pH and increases oxygen release from Hb. 31P NMR tracking of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), allosteric effector of Hb and non-penetrating anion in RBCs, reports on erythrocytes internal environment. 31P resonances of 2,3-DPG are pH-sensitive, their positions indicate the oxygenation state of RBCs and interactions with effectors such as ITPP. Here we show in vitro and in vivo, that modifying Hb activity through band-3 anion transporter, ITPP enhances oxygen release and controls RBC internal pH. Its blood availability validates applicability of ITPP-based strategies.",

This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin and myo-inositol combination therapy compared to metformin monotherapy in patients with PCOS. Materials and methods This was a phase III, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 196 patients with PCOS were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a fixed-dose combination of metformin hydrochloride 500 mg and myo-inositol 600 mg (Met-Myo) or metformin 500 mg alone (Met) twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary study endpoints were improvement in insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, HOMA-IR) at week 24 and improvement in menstrual cycle disturbances at 12 and 24 weeks. Results The Met-Myo combination demonstrated a significantly superior response with 63 (75%) patients showing improvement in HOMA-IR compared to 54 (60.67%) in the Met group (p = 0.049) at week 24. The improvement in the number of patients with heavy menstrual blood flow (>80 mL) was significantly greater in the Met-Myo group (four patients, 4.76%) compared to the Met group (six patients, 6.74%) at week 24 (p = 0.029). Improvement in the percentage of patients with normal menstrual frequency and infrequent menstruation from baseline to week 24 was significantly greater in the Met-Myo group compared to the Met group (p = 0.049). Safety assessments revealed a low and comparable incidence of mild adverse events. Conclusion Metformin-myo-inositol combination therapy is superior to metformin monotherapy in addressing menstrual irregularities and improving insulin resistance in PCOS patients, thereby providing a promising avenue for optimizing the management of PCOS."

      "abstract": "Despite a high sucrose accumulation in its taproot vacuoles, sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) is sensitive to freezing. Earlier, a taproot-specific accumulation of raffinose was shown to have beneficial effects on the freezing tolerance of the plant. However, synthesis of raffinose and other oligosaccharides of the raffinose family depends on the availability of myo-inositol. Since inositol and inositol-metabolising enzymes reside in different organelles, functional inositol metabolism and raffinose synthesis depend on inositol transporters. We identified five homologues of putative inositol transporters in the sugar beet genome, two of which, BvINT1;1 and BvINT1;2, are localised at the tonoplast. Among these, only the transcript of BvINT1;1 is highly upregulated in sugar beet taproots under cold. BvINT1;1 exhibits a high transport specificity for inositol and sugar beet mutants lacking functional BvINT1;1 contain increased inositol levels, likely accumulating in the vacuole, and decreased raffinose contents under cold treatment. Due to the quenching capacity of raffinose for Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which accumulate under cold stress, bvint1;1 sugar beet plants show increased expression of both, ROS marker genes and detoxifying enzymes. Based on these findings, we conclude that the vacuolar inositol transporter BvINT1;1 is contributing to ROS-homoeostasis in the cold metabolism of sugar beet.",

However, information elucidating the role of Myo-Ins in porcine embryonic development after parthenogenetic activation (PA) is still lacking. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Myo-Ins on porcine embryos and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: In this study, various concentrations of Myo-Ins (0, 5, 10, and 20 mM) were added to the porcine zygotic medium (PZM3) during the in vitro culture (IVC) of porcine embryos. Several characteristics were evaluated, including cleavage rate, blastocyst formation rate, intracellular glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in 4-5 cell stage embryos, total cell number, apoptotic rate in blastocysts, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial quantity, mitochondrial stress in the blastocysts, and gene expression for antioxidant and mitochondrial function markers. Additionally, the immunofluorescence of HO-1 was assessed. RESULTS: The results showed that Myo-Ins at concentrations of 10 and 20 mM significantly increased the blastocyst formation rate compared to the control group. Embryos supplemented with 20 mM Myo-Ins exhibited higher GSH levels and lower ROS levels than those in the control group. Myo-Ins supplementation also decreased the rate of apoptosis and the apoptotic index in the treatment groups. Additionally, embryos supplemented with 20 mM Myo-Ins showed increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), greater mitochondrial quantity, and reduced oxidative stress in the mitochondria. Interestingly, the expression levels of genes related to mitochondrial function and the nuclear erythroid factor 2-related factor (NRF2) pathway were elevated in the Myo-Ins treated groups. Furthermore, immunofluorescence results indicated that 20 mM Myo-Ins significantly increased HO-1 expression in blastocysts compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, 20 mM Myo-Ins supplementation enhanced blastocyst development and improved mitochondrial function by regulating apoptosis, reducing oxidative stress, and activating the NRF2 pathway."

METHODS: The DU-145 cells have been treated to different doses of Myo-inositol in order to ascertain the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) using the trypan blue exclusion assay. The impact of Myo-inositol on proteomic profiles was evaluated using 2D gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). RESULTS: Myo-inositol significantly reduced DU-145 cell viability with an IC50 of 0.06 mg/ml (p<0.05). Proteomic analysis highlighted marked differences in protein expression between treated and untreated cells, particularly in proteins related to cytoskeletal regulation, apoptosis, and stress response. LC-MS further identified significant alterations in protein profiles, with suppression of proteins like Annexin A2 and Cofilin-1-A in controls, and upregulation of proteins such as Rho GTPase-activating protein, Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1), and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) in treated samples (p<0.001), indicating modulation of key signaling pathways involved in tumor suppression and oncogenesis. CONCLUSION: Myo-inositol exhibits anticancer properties in prostate cancer cells by impacting cell viability and altering protein expression. While promising as an adjunctive treatment, further studies are needed to understand its mechanisms and potential in combination therapies for managing CRPC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia, lacks effective long-term treatments. Current therapies offer temporary relief or fail to halt its progression and are often inaccessible due to cost. AD involves multiple pathological processes, including amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, insulin resistance, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and systemic inflammation accelerated by gut microbiota dysbiosis originating from a leaky gut. Given this context, exploring alternative therapeutic interventions capable of addressing the multifaceted components of AD etiology is essential. METHODS: This study suggests D-Pinitol (DPIN) as a potential treatment modifier for AD. DPIN, derived from carob pods, demonstrates insulin-sensitizing, tau hyperphosphorylation inhibition, and antioxidant properties. To test this hypothesis, we studied whether chronic oral administration of DPIN (200 mg/kg/day) could reverse the AD-like disease progression in the 5×FAD mice. RESULTS: Results showed that treatment of 5×FAD mice with DPIN improved cognition, reduced hippocampal Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau levels, increased insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression, enhanced pro-cognitive hormone circulation (such as ghrelin and leptin), and normalized the PI3K/Akt insulin pathway. This enhancement may be mediated through the modulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). DPIN also protected the gut barrier and microbiota, reducing the pro-inflammatory impact of the leaky gut observed in 5×FAD mice. DPIN reduced bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-associated inflammation, as well as restored intestinal proteins such as Claudin-3. This effect was associated with a modulation of gut microbiota towards a more balanced bacterial composition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore DPIN's promise in mitigating cognitive decline in the early AD stages, positioning it as a potential disease modifier.",

The study aims to determine which treatment option is more effective in restoring euthyroid state, as indicated by changes in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), T3, T4, thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). METHODS: Google Scholar and PubMed databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported outcomes of combined treatment (MI + Se) in restoring a euthyroid state, specifically comparing it with selenium-only (Se-only) treatment. Changes in TSH, T3, T4, TPOAb, and TgAb levels from baseline were defined as indicators to compare the effect of combined versus selenium-only treatment in restoring euthyroid levels. The Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale were used to assess the quality of the randomized control trials included in the study. Review Manager (version 5.4, Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used for statistical analysis. RESULT: We pooled three studies, enrolling 151 participants in the MI + Se group and 137 participants in the Se group. Supplementation of Se with MI demonstrated a significant reduction in TSH levels compared to Se alone (SMD = -1.15, 95% CI: -1.60 to -0.69, P < .00001). MI + Se treatment also significantly reduced TgAb levels compared to Se (SMD = -0.51, 95% CI: -0.78 to -0.24, P = .0002). In contrast, TPOAB, T3 and T4 levels were non-significantly reduced from baseline in patients treated with MI + Se when compared to Se alone (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI: -0.44 to 0.09, P = .20), (SMD = 0.16, 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.42, P = .22), and (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI: -0.23 to 0.83, P = .26) respectively. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of Se with MI showed a significant reduction in TSH and TgAb levels compared to selenium-only treatment, with a non-significant reduction in TPOAB, T3, and T4 levels. This entails the need for powered clinical trials and observational studies with longer follow-ups to critically assess the role of combined therapy in restoring euthyroid state in patients with AIT."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Inositols play significant roles in biological systems. Myo-inositol (MI), the most prevalent isomer, functions as an osmolyte and mediates cell signal transduction. Other notable isomers include Scyllo-inositol (SCI) and D-Chiro-inositol (DCHI). Our previous investigations have highlighted MI's potential antiepileptogenic effects, although its exact mechanisms of action during epileptogenesis remain unclear. A critical, unexplored area is how inositols interact with proteins. Additionally, the antiepileptogenic capabilities of SCI and DCHI have yet to be determined. This study seeks to address these gaps. METHODS: Inositol interacting proteins were identified by cellular thermal shift assay. Status epilepticus (SE) in rats was induced using kainic acid (KA), followed by a 28-day treatment with either MI, SCI, DCHI, or saline. The duration and frequencies of behavioral spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were scored for 8 weeks by 24 h video monitoring system. The effects of inositol treatment on spatial learning and memory deficits associated with epileptogenesis were evaluated by Morris water maze test. The changes in protein amounts were studied by Western immunoblotting. RESULTS: We identified several proteins that interact with inositols, noting both commonalities and isomer-specific associations. For the first time, we demonstrated that the treatment with SCI and DCHI, alongside MI, significantly reduces the frequency and duration of behavioral SRS in a KA-induced post-status epilepsy model in rats. This reduction persisted for 4 weeks post-treatment. Moreover, all three inositol isomers mitigated spatial learning and memory deficits associated with epileptogenesis. Alterations in the inositol interacting proteins: alpha synuclein and 14-3-3 theta were further examined 8 weeks post-SE in the hippocampus and neocortex of rats. SIGNIFICANCE: Myo-inositol, SCI and DCHI interact with a number of proteins involved in different biological pathways. All studied inositol isomers express long-term beneficial effects on KA-induced SRS and the associated comorbidities. Inositols can be successfully used in the future for translational research. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures and a range of associated comorbidities. The process that leads to the development of epilepsy is called epileptogenesis, and currently, no medication can effectively prevent it. Our study investigated the effects of a group of compounds-myo-inositol, scyllo-inositol, and D-chiro-inositol-that have potential antiepileptogenic properties on epilepsy induced by kainic acid. We found that: (i) the three inositol isomers share some common target proteins and also have unique ones and (ii) all of them counteract epileptogenesis and the related cognitive impairments.",

This study aimed to assess the impact of Myo-inositol supplements on semen quality and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. The objective was to identify relevant human studies that investigated the effects of Myo-inositol treatment on various sperm factors, such as sperm motility, sperm concentration, sperm morphology, viable spermatozoa, spermatozoa with DNA fragmentation, and pregnancy rate. Additionally, the testosterone levels of patients with Oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT) after Myo-inositol application were considered. The findings of 16 selected studies from 2240 citations indicated significant improvements in several parameters of sperm after Myo-inositol administration. Myo-inositol treatment was associated with a notable increase in total sperm motility (SMD 0.90; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.46; I 2 = 0%, p = .001) and progressive sperm motility (SMD 1.48; 95% CI: 0.37 to 2.59; I 2  = 0%, p = .008). Additionally, there was a significant improvement in testosterone levels (SMD 0.54; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.73; I 2  = 0%, p < .0001). Furthermore, Myo-inositol therapy demonstrated a significant decrease in spermatozoa with DNA fragmentation (SMD -1.37; 95% CI: -2.43 to -0.32; I 2  = 85%, p = .01). This study suggests that Myo-inositol therapy has a positive impact on specific sperm parameters, such as total and progressive sperm motility, along with testosterone levels. These findings provide support for the potential benefits of Myo-inositol in improving male fertility parameters related to sperm factors."

      "abstract": "Myo-inositol (MYO) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI) are the two most significant isomeric forms of inositol, playing a critical role in intracellular signaling. MYO is the most abundant form of inositol in nature; DCI is produced from MYO through epimerization by an insulin-dependent enzyme. Recently, it has been demonstrated that inositol may influence oocyte maturation and improve intracellular Ca2+ oscillation in the oocytes, and it has been proposed as a potential intervention for restoring spontaneous ovulation. The MYO concentration in human follicular fluid is considered a bioindicator of oocyte quality. In the ovary, DCI modulates the activity of aromatase, thus regulating androgen synthesis. Under physiological conditions, the MYO/DCI ratio is maintained at 40:1 in plasma. In women with PCOS, the MYO/DCI ratio is lowered to 0:2:1, contributing to elevated androgen production. By regulating FSH signaling, MYO administration increases the number of high-quality embryos available for transfer in poor responder patients. Finally, by acting downstream to insulin signaling, inositol administration during pregnancy may represent a novel strategy for counteracting gestational diabetes. These findings show that diet supplementation with inositol may be a promising strategy to address female infertility and sustain a healthy pregnancy."

      "abstract": "Acquisition of prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) manifested during androgen ablation therapy (ABT) contributes to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, little is known about the specific metabolites critically orchestrating this process. Here, we show that IMPA1-derived inositol enriched in PCSCs is a key metabolite crucially maintaining PCSCs for CRPC progression and ABT resistance. Notably, conditional Impa1 knockout in the prostate abrogates the pool and properties of PCSCs to orchestrate CRPC progression and prolong the survival of TRAMP mice. IMPA1-derived inositol serves as a cofactor that directly binds to and activates IMPDH2, which synthesizes guanylate nucleotides for maintaining PCSCs with ARlow/- features leading to CRPC progression and ABT resistance. IMPA1/inositol/IMPDH2 axis is upregulated in human prostate cancer, and its overexpression predicts poor survival outcomes. Genetically and pharmacologically targeting the IMPA1/inositol/IMPDH2 axis abrogates CRPC and overcomes ABT resistance in various CRPC xenografts, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor models, and TRAMP mouse models. Our study identifies IMPDH2 as an inositol sensor whose activation by inositol represents a key mechanism for maintaining PCSCs for CRPC and ABT resistance.",

For this purpose, we analyzed the mRNA expression of steroidogenic genes and the secretion of progesterone (P4) and 17β-estradiol (E2) in an unstimulated and/or dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-stimulated environment under MI and DCI influence. Thus, we used the HGrC1 and KGN cell lines as in vitro models of healthy and cancerous granulosa cells. We found that DHT, the most potent androgen, increased E2 secretion and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage gene (CYP11A1) mRNA expression without affecting 450 aromatase (CYP19A1) in AGCTs. However, after the MI and DCI treatment of KGN cells, both compounds strongly reduced StAR and CYP11A1 expression. Interestingly, in DHT-stimulated KGN cells, only DCI alone and its cotreatment with MI reduced both CYP11A1 mRNA and E2 secretion. These findings suggest that CYP11A1 is responsible for the antiestrogenic effect of DCI in the androgen-rich environment of AGCTs. Therefore, MI and DCI could be used as effective agents in the adjuvant treatment of AGCT, but further detailed studies are needed.",

Here, we provide evidence that host (SlMIPS1) and pathogen (Rs_MIPS) myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (MIPS) genes are required for successful infection of Rhizoctonia solani, a devastating necrotrophic fungal pathogen, in tomato. Silencing of either SlMIPS1 or Rs_MIPS prevented disease, whereas an exogenous spray of myo-inositol enhanced disease severity. SlMIPS1 was upregulated upon R. solani infection, and potentially promoted source-to-sink transition, induced SWEET gene expression, and facilitated sugar availability in the infected tissues. In addition, salicylic acid (SA)-jasmonic acid homeostasis was altered and SA-mediated defence was suppressed; therefore, disease was promoted. On the other hand, silencing of SlMIPS1 limited sugar availability and induced SA-mediated defence to prevent R. solani infection. Virus-induced gene silencing of NPR1, a key gene in SA signalling, rendered SlMIPS1-silenced tomato lines susceptible to infection. These analyses suggest that induction of SA-mediated defence imparts disease tolerance in SlMIPS1-silenced tomato lines. In addition, we present evidence that SlMIPS1 and SA negatively regulate each other to modulate the defence response. SA treatment reduced SlMIPS1 expression and myo-inositol content in tomato, whereas myo-inositol treatment prevented SA-mediated defence. We emphasize that downregulation of host/pathogen MIPS can be an important strategy for controlling diseases caused by R. solani in agriculturally important crops.",

Despite their significant physiological and clinical importance, the mechanisms of HDAC activation remain poorly understood. This study reveals that inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is essential for activating HDAC1 and HDAC3 in cell lines and mice. IPMK deletion or inactivation of its kinase activity selectively impairs HDAC1/3's deacetylase activity, significantly influencing gene expression. Disruption of the IPMK-HDAC1/3 epigenetic axis results in transcriptional upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes, exacerbating cell and intestinal permeability. Remarkably, treatment of IPMK KO cells with cell-permeable inositol hexaphosphate (InsP6) rescues these defects. This study elucidates the role of IPMK's kinase activity in HDAC1/3 activation and its implications for intestinal barrier function."

      "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), one of the most serious long-term consequences of diabetes, is closely associated with myocardial fatty acid metabolism. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1β (CPT-1β) is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. Intermedin (IMD) is a pivotal bioactive small molecule peptide, participating in the protection of various cardiovascular diseases. However, the role and underlying mechanisms of IMD in DCM are still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether IMD alleviates DCM via regulating CPT-1β. A rat DCM model was established by having rats to drink fructose water for 12 weeks. A mouse DCM model was induced by feeding mice a high-fat diet for 16 weeks. We showed that IMD and its receptor complexes levels were significantly down-regulated in the cardiac tissues of DCM rats and mice. Reduced expression of IMD was also observed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with palmitic acid (PA, 300 μM) in vitro. Exogenous and endogenous IMD mitigated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, dysfunction, and lipid accumulation in DCM rats and IMD-transgenic DCM mice, whereas knockout of IMD worsened these pathological processes in IMD-knockout DCM mice. In vitro, IMD alleviated PA-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibroblast activation. We found that CPT-1β enzyme activity, mRNA and protein levels, and acetyl-CoA content were increased in T2DM patients, rats and mice. IMD up-regulated the CPT-1β levels and acetyl-CoA content in T2DM rats and mice. Knockdown of CPT-1β blocked the effects of IMD on increasing acetyl-CoA content and on inhibiting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibroblast activation. IMD receptor antagonist IMD17-47 and the phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor LY294002 reversed the effects of IMD on up-regulating CPT-1β and acetyl-CoA expression and on inhibiting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibroblast activation. We revealed that IMD alleviates DCM by up-regulating CPT-1β via calcitonin receptor-like receptor/receptor activity-modifying protein (CRLR/RAMP) receptor complexes and PI3K/Akt signaling. IMD may serve as a potent therapeutic target for the treatment of DCM."

      "abstract": "Dietary phytic acid/phytate/myo-inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), a phosphate reservoir in plants, was viewed as antinutrient, caused by an influence on the bioavailability of minerals through its chelating activity. However, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that IP6 has beneficial (e.g., antiinflammatory, antibacterial, and anticancer) effects on multiple biological processes. Also, IP6 and its metabolites are known to exist in mammalian cells, including human cells, and the role of IP6 as a functional molecule is attracting attention. IP6 can bind to the growth sites of hydroxy-apatite (HA) and calcium oxalate crystals to prevent their growth and hence inhibit pathological calcification. SNF472, hexasodium IP6, is currently being evaluated in clinical studies as a treatment for vascular calcification and calciphylaxis. However, since HA crystal growth within bone matrix is an essential process in bone formation, it is possible that IP6 intake may inhibit physiological mineralization and bone formation, although currently more published studies suggest that IP6 may contribute to bone health rather than inhibit bone formation. Given that IP6 and its metabolites are thought to have diverse activities and many health benefits, it remains important to consider the range of effects of IP6 on bone.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Metformin was the first medication targeting insulin resistance in PCOS, and it has been extensively studied as a metabolic treatment option. In recent years, inositols have emerged as potential treatment options for PCOS, but confidence in the available evidence supporting their use is limited. METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for RCTs comparing the use of combined metformin and inositol versus metformin alone in women with PCOS. A random-effects model was used to calculate the risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A p-value of <0.05 was deemed as statistically significant. RESULTS: Six RCTs and 388 patients were included in the analysis, with follow-up ranging from 3 to 6 months. Combination therapy was significantly associated with improved menstrual cycle regularity (RR 1.56; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.41; p = 0.04), and lower values of modified Ferriman-Gallwey score (MD -0.97; 95% CI -1.53 to -0.40; p < 0.01) and LH/FSH ratios (MD -0.13; 95% CI -0.24 to -0.03; p = 0.01). Differences in acne (p = 0.58), body mass index (p = 0.13), fasting blood glucose (p = 0.07) and HOMA-IR (p = 0.25) were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In this meta-analysis of RCTs, combination therapy was associated with cycle regularization and reduction in hirsutism and LH/FSH ratio compared to metformin monotherapy. Further studies are needed to clarify the true benefits of the use of inositol in PCOS treatment.",

Myo-inositol (MI) plays a crucial role in a wide range of physiological and pathological functions within human cells. To date, studies have investigated the function of MI in thyroid physiology as well as its potential therapeutic benefits for hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis. However, research in the field of TC is very restricted. Metabolomics studies have highlighted the promising diagnostic capabilities of MI, recognizing it as a metabolic biomarker for identifying thyroid tumors. Furthermore, MI can influence therapeutic characteristics by modulating key cellular pathways involved in TC. This review evaluates the potential application of MI as a naturally occurring compound in the management of thyroid diseases, including hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis, and especially TC. The limited number of studies conducted in the field of TC emphasizes the critical need for future research to comprehend the multifaceted role of MI in TC. A significant amount of research and clinical trials is necessary to understand the role of MI in the pathology of TC, its diagnostic and therapeutic potential, and to pave the way for personalized medicine strategies in managing this intricate disease.",

IPMK has been implicated in cellular metabolism, but its function at the systemic level is still poorly understood. Since skeletal muscle is a major contributor to energy homeostasis, we have developed a mouse model in which skeletal muscle IPMK is specifically deleted and examined how a loss of IPMK affects whole-body metabolism. Here, we report that mice in which IPMK knockout is deleted, specifically in the skeletal muscle, displayed an increased body weight, disrupted glucose tolerance, and reduced exercise tolerance under the normal diet. Moreover, these changes were associated with an increased accumulation of triglyceride in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, we have confirmed that a loss of IPMK led to reduced beta-oxidation, increased triglyceride accumulation, and impaired insulin response in IPMK-deficient muscle cells. Thus, our results suggest that IPMK mediates the whole-body metabolism via regulating muscle metabolism and may be potentially targeted for the treatment of metabolic syndromes."

METHODS: Several databases including PubMed, EMbase, Web of science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases were systemically searched from inception to October 2021, and we included the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of myo-inositol supplementation on the outcomes of women with gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed if at least one threshold of glucose concentration was exceeded and the three thresholds included 92, 180, and 153 mg/dl for 0, 1 and 2 h, respectively, after a 75-g, 2-h glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: Four RCTs and 317 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with routine treatment in pregnant women with gestational diabetes, myo-inositol supplementation could lead to remarkably decreased treatment requirement with insulin (odd ratio [OR] = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11-0.52; p = .0003) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, standard mean difference [SMD]= -1.18; 95% CI= -1.50 to -0.87; p < .00001), but demonstrated no obvious impact on birth weight (SMD= -0.11; 95% CI= -0.83 to 0.61 g; p = .76), cesarean section (OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.46-1.47; p = .51) or the need of NICU (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.03-26.57; p = .94).

METHODS: The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist (registration number: CRD42023433328). Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, and ClinicalTrials databases. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included for qualitative analysis reporting on 820 participants. Four meta-analyses were performed. Numbers of retrieved oocytes in comparison of intervention and control group were higher in inositol group (mean difference [MD] = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.05-0.77, p = 0.02). Meta-analysis of two studies comparing numbers of oocytes among poor ovarian responder patients showed no significant difference between intervention and control group (MD = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.57-1.58, p = 0.36). Miscarriage rate has no statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups (risk ratios [RRs] = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.20-3.32, p = 0.77). Inositol played no role in improving clinical pregnancy rates; there was no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group (RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 0.88-2.25, p = 0.15).

However, the presence of FSH receptor (FSHR) and aromatase (CYP19A1) activity responses to physiological endocrine stimuli play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Preliminary data suggest that myo-Inositol (myo-Ins) and D-Chiro-Inositol (D-Chiro-Ins) may reactivate CYP19A1 activity. We investigated the steroidogenic pathway of Theca (TCs) and Granulosa cells (GCs) in an experimental model of murine PCOS induced in CD1 mice exposed for 10 weeks to a continuous light regimen. The effect of treatment with different combinations of myo-Ins and D-Chiro-Ins on the expression of Fshr, androgenic, and estrogenic enzymes was analyzed by real-time PCR in isolated TCs and GCs and in ovaries isolated from healthy and PCOS mice. Myo-Ins and D-Chiro-Ins, at a ratio of 40:1 at pharmacological and physiological concentrations, positively modulate the steroidogenic activity of TCs and the expression of Cyp19a1 and Fshr in GCs. Moreover, in vivo, inositols (40:1 ratio) significantly increase Cyp19a1 and Fshr. These changes in gene expression are mirrored by modifications in hormone levels in the serum of treated animals. Myo-Ins and D-Chiro-Ins in the 40:1 formula efficiently rescued PCOS features by up-regulating aromatase and FSHR levels while down-regulating androgen excesses produced by TCs.",

This study aimed to identify the intervention components that may contribute to this effect. Associations of plasma concentrations of myo-inositol and vitamins B2, B6, B12, and D at preconception (before and after supplementation), early (~7-weeks), and late pregnancy (~28-weeks) with PBL were assessed by multiple linear regression, adjusting for site, ethnicity, preconception BMI, parity, and previous cesarean section. Amongst 583 women, a higher concentration of myo-inositol in early pregnancy was associated with a PBL reduction [βadj -1.26 (95%CI -2.23, -0.29) mL per µmol/L myo-inositol increase, p = 0.011]. Applying this co-efficient to the increase in mean 7-week-myo-inositol concentration of 23.4 µmol/L with the intervention equated to a PBL reduction of 29.5 mL (~8.4% of mean PBL of 350 mL among controls), accounting for 84.3% of the previously reported intervention effect of 35 mL. None of the examined vitamins were associated with PBL. Therefore, myo-inositol may be a key intervention component mediating the PBL reduction. Further work is required to determine the mechanisms involved.",

To date MI supplementation is reported to be effective in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, it is also suggested to alleviate the symptoms of diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders, but to date no statistically significant effects of inositol on depressive and anxiety symptoms were proven. In the study of anxiolytic effects in zebrafish, we often use the thigmotaxis index measuring the ratio of the amount of time the animal spends near the walls compared to the entire arena. AIM: The objective of this paper was to examine the effect of MI on zebrafish embryos' locomotor activity, as well as its potential anxiolytic activity in zebrafish larvae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the first part of the experiment, the embryos were incubated with 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL MI. 1-day post fertilization, embryo mobility was evaluated and burst activity was calculated. In the next part of the study, the behavior of 5-day-old larvae was tested. RESULTS: Tests on embryo movement showed an increase in burst activity in the MI group at concentrations of 40 mg/mL (p < 0.0001) and a slight decrease in the group at concentrations of 10 mg/mL (p < 0.05). MI in the light/dark challenge had no impact on the thigmotaxis index. CONCLUSIONS: MI was shown to not affect stress reduction in zebrafish larvae. Further research on the potential of MI and other stereoisomers is needed.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: PCOS, beyond being characterized by reproductive disturbances, is a complicated rapid expanding metabolic and endocrinologic disorder of the recent times. Nearly 70% PCOS women show resistance to insulin. AIM: The aim of the study is to determine and compare the effectiveness of acarbose plus metformin and acarbose plus myo-inositol combination therapy in alleviating the metabolic and endocrinologic complications of PCOS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An open labelled RCT was conducted on 168 PCOS women attending the gynaecology clinic at SRM MCH & RC, Chengalpattu and the trial was registered in CTRI (No. CTRI/2022/04/041877). Group A (n = 56) received metformin 500 mg/TID alone; group B (n = 54) received (acarbose 25 mg/TID for 4 weeks then 50 mg/TID for other 20 weeks) along with metformin 500 mg/TID and group C (n = 54) received (acarbose 25 mg/TID for 4 weeks then 50 mg/TID for other 20 weeks) along with myoinositol 1000 mg/BD. All parameters were measured at baseline and at the end of 6 months. RESULTS: Significant reduction of LH, LH: FSH, TT, HOMA-IR was observed in all the groups. FSH increased only in metformin group. Increase in serum progesterone and reduction in FI, TGL, LDL were significant only in acarbose plus myo-inositol group. SHBG and HDL increased significantly only in acarbose plus metformin group. No changes in BMI, TC and VLDL were observed in any group. CONCLUSION: Therefore, decrease in FI, HOMA-IR, TGL, LDL seen in acarbose plus myo-inositol group indirectly contributes to cardio-metabolic safety in PCOS. Similarly, a significant increase in SHBG levels with acarbose plus metformin group shows correction of the excess androgen and restoration of ovulation.",

      "abstract": "Low temperatures pose a common challenge in the production of cucumbers and tomatoes, hindering plant growth and, in severe cases, leading to plant death. In our investigation, we observed a substantial improvement in the growth of cucumber and tomato seedlings through the application of corn steep liquor (CSL), myo-inositol (MI), and their combinations. When subjected to low-temperature stress, these treatments resulted in heightened levels of photosynthetic pigments, thereby fostering enhanced photosynthesis in both tomato and cucumber plants. Furthermore, it contributed to a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and electrolyte leakage (REP). The effectiveness of the treatment was further validated through the analysis of key gene expressions (CBF1, COR, MIOX4, and MIPS1) in cucumber. Particularly, noteworthy positive outcomes were noted in the treatment involving 0.6 mL L-1 CSL combined with 72 mg L-1 MI. This study provides valuable technical insights into leveraging the synergistic effects of inositol and maize leachate to promote early crop growth and bolster resistance to low temperatures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) results from pulmonary vasculopathy, initially leading to a compensatory right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, and eventually to RV failure. Hypoxia can trigger both pulmonary vasculopathy and RV failure. Therefore, we tested if myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP), which facilitates oxygen dissociation from haemoglobin, can relieve pulmonary vasculopathy and RV hypoxia, and eventually prevent RV failure and mortality in the rat model of monocrotaline-induced PH. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats were injected with monocrotaline (PH) or saline (control) and received ITPP or placebo for 5 weeks. Serial echocardiograms were obtained to monitor the disease, pressure-volume loops were recorded and evaluated, myocardial pO2 was measured using a fluorescent probe, and histological and molecular analyses were conducted at the conclusion of the experiment. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: ITPP reduced PH-related mortality. It had no effect on progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, yet significantly relieved intramyocardial RV hypoxia, which was associated with improvement of RV function and reduction of RV wall stress. ITPP also tended to prevent increased hypoxia inducible factor-1α expression in RV cardiac myocytes but did not affect RV capillary density. IMPLICATIONS: Our study suggests that strategies aimed at increasing oxygen delivery to hypoxic RV in PH could potentially be used as adjuncts to other therapies that target pulmonary vessels, thus increasing the ability of the RV to withstand increased afterload and reducing mortality. ITPP may be one such potential therapy.",

      "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays L.) is an important food crop with a wide range of uses in both industry and agriculture. Drought stress during its growth cycle can greatly reduce maize crop yield and quality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying maize responses to drought stress remain unclear. In this work, a WRKY transcription factor-encoding gene, ZmWRKY30, from drought-treated maize leaves was screened out and characterized. ZmWRKY30 gene expression was induced by dehydration treatments. The ZmWRKY30 protein localized to the nucleus and displayed transactivation activity in yeast. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, Arabidopsis lines overexpressing ZmWRKY30 exhibited a significantly enhanced drought stress tolerance, as evidenced by the improved survival rate, increased antioxidant enzyme activity by superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), elevated proline content, and reduced lipid peroxidation recorded after drought stress treatment. In contrast, the mutator (Mu)-interrupted ZmWRKY30 homozygous mutant (zmwrky30) was more sensitive to drought stress than its null segregant (NS), characterized by the decreased survival rate, reduced antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD, POD, and CAT) and proline content, as well as increased malondialdehyde accumulation. RNA-Seq analysis further revealed that, under drought conditions, the knockout of the ZmWRKY30 gene in maize affected the expression of genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS), proline, and myo-inositol metabolism. Meanwhile, the zmwrky30 mutant exhibited significant downregulation of myo-inositol content in leaves under drought stress. Combined, our results suggest that ZmWRKY30 positively regulates maize responses to water scarcity. This work provides potential target genes for the breeding of drought-tolerant maize.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have shown that gene alternative splicing (AS) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications. Currently, myo-inositol (MI) is considered as effective for the treatment of insulin resistance and lipid metabolism disorders in diabetes patients. We hope to better explore the potential roles of gene AS and lncRNAs in liver glucose and lipid metabolism in diabetes, as well as the effects of myo-inositol treatment, through transcriptome analysis. METHODS: This study analysed glucose and lipid metabolism-related biochemical indicators and liver HE staining in four groups of mice: the control group (Ctrl group), the diabetes group (DM group), the myo-inositol treatment group (MI group), and the metformin treatment group (Met group). The changes in relevant gene-regulated alternative splicing events (RASEs) and lncRNAs were analysed by RNA sequencing of liver tissue, and coexpression analysis and functional enrichment analysis were used to predict the possible lncRNAs and RASEs involved in liver glucose and lipid metabolism. RESULT: Metformin and myo-inositol alleviated insulin resistance, lipid metabolism disorders, and hepatic steatosis in diabetic mice. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed differential splicing events of genes related to lipid metabolism and differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs). Six different lncRNAs and their potentially interacting splicing events were predicted. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed novel changes in RASEs and lncRNAs in the livers of diabetic mice following treatment with myo-inositol, which may shed light on the potential mechanisms by which myo-inositol delays and treats the progression of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in diabetes."

In this study, we explored the protective effects of MI against hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in db/db mice, a typical animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MI supplement effectively suppressed the high plasma glucose and insulin levels and markedly relieved the insulin resistance (IR) in the db/db mice, comparable to metformin's effects. In MIN6 pancreatic β cells, MI also restrained the upsurge of insulin secretion stimulated by high-concentration glucose but had no impact on the promoted cell proliferation. Moreover, MI abated the enhanced plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in the db/db mice. Notably, the lipid droplet formation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from db/db mice was significantly diminished after the treatment of MI, indicating that MI could effectively inhibit the differentiation of db/db mouse MSCs into adipocytes. However, MI regretfully failed to control obesity in db/db mice. This work proved that MI significantly helped db/db mice's metabolic disorders, indicating that MI has potential as an effective adjunctive treatment for hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in T2DM patients.",

Supplemental myo-inositol (MI) can prevent NTDs in some mouse models and shows potential for prevention of human NTDs. We investigated effects of maternal MI intake on embryonic MI status and metabolism in curly tail mice, which are genetically predisposed to NTDs that are inositol-responsive but folic acid resistant. Dietary MI deficiency caused diminished MI in maternal plasma and embryos, showing that de novo synthesis is insufficient to maintain MI levels in either adult or embryonic mice. Under normal maternal dietary conditions, curly tail embryos that developed cranial NTDs had significantly lower MI content than unaffected embryos, revealing an association between diminished MI status and failure of cranial neurulation. Expression of inositol-3-phosphate synthase 1, required for inositol biosynthesis, was less abundant in the cranial neural tube than at other axial levels. Supplemental MI or d-chiro-inositol (DCI) have previously been found to prevent NTDs in curly tail embryos. Here, we investigated the metabolic effects of MI and DCI treatments by mass spectrometry-based metabolome analysis. Among inositol-responsive metabolites, we noted a disproportionate effect on nucleotides, especially purines. We also found altered proportions of 5-methyltetrahydrolate and tetrahydrofolate in MI-treated embryos suggesting altered folate metabolism. Treatment with nucleotides or the one-carbon donor formate has also been found to prevent NTDs in curly tail embryos. Together, these findings suggest that the protective effect of inositol may be mediated through the enhanced supply of nucleotides during neural tube closure.",

Herein, we describe the coordination of Pi uptake and efflux pathways to maintain mammalian cell Pi homeostasis. We discover that XPR1, the presumed Pi efflux transporter, separately supervises rates of Pi uptake. This direct, regulatory interplay arises from XPR1 being a binding partner for the Pi uptake transporter PiT1, involving a predicted transmembrane helix/extramembrane loop in XPR1, and its hitherto unknown localization in a subset of intracellular LAMP1-positive puncta (named \"XLPVs\"). A pharmacological mimic of Pi homeostatic challenge is sensed by the inositol pyrophosphate IP8, which functionalizes XPR1 to respond in a temporally hierarchal manner, initially adjusting the rate of Pi efflux, followed subsequently by independent modulation of PiT1 turnover to reset the rate of Pi uptake. These observations generate a unifying model of mammalian cellular Pi homeostasis, expanding opportunities for therapeutic intervention.",

      "abstract": "The src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatases SHIP1 and SHIP2 are two proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways and have been linked to the pathogenesis of several diseases. Both protein paralogs are well known for their involvement in the formation of various kinds of cancer. SHIP1, which is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells, has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in leukemogenesis especially in myeloid leukemia, whereas SHIP2, which is expressed ubiquitously, has been implicated as an oncogene in a wider variety of cancer types and is suggested to be involved in the process of metastasis of carcinoma cells. However, there are numerous other diseases, such as inflammatory diseases as well as allergic responses, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke, in which SHIP1 can play a role. Moreover, SHIP2 overexpression was shown to correlate with opsismodysplasia and Alzheimer's disease, as well as metabolic diseases. The SHIP1-inhibitor 3-α-aminocholestane (3AC), and SHIP1-activators, such as AQX-435 and AQX-1125, and SHIP2-inhibitors, such as K161 and AS1949490, have been developed and partly tested in clinical trials, which indicates the importance of the SHIP-paralogs as possible targets in the therapy of those diseases. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the current knowledge about the involvement of SHIP proteins in the pathogenesis of cancer and other human diseases and to create awareness that SHIP1 and SHIP2 are more than just tumor suppressors and oncogenes.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a complex, degenerative process associated with various metabolic abnormalities. Ginsenosides (GS) is the main active components of Panax ginseng, which has anti-aging effects and improves metabolism. However, the anti-aging effect and the mechanism of GS in middle-aged mice has not been elucidated. In this study, GS after 3-month treatment significantly improved the grip strength, fatigue resistance, cognitive indices, and cardiac function of 15-month-old mice. Meanwhile, GS treatment reduced the fat content and obviously inhibited histone H2AX phosphorylation at Ser 139 (γ-H2AX), a marker of DNA damage in major organs, especially in the heart and liver. Further, the correlation analysis of serum metabolomics combined with aging phenotype suggested that myo-inositol (MI) upregulated by GS was positively correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), the main indicators of cardiac function. More importantly, liver tissue metabolomic analysis showed that GS increased MI content by promoting the synthesis pathway from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to MI for the inhibition of liver aging. Finally, we proved that MI reduced the percentage of senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining, γ-H2AX immunofluorescence staining, p21 expression, and the production of reactive oxygen species in H2O2-induced cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that GS can enhance multiple organ functions, especially cardiac function for promoting the healthspan of aging mice, which is mediated by the conversion of PC to MI in the liver and the increase of MI level in the serum. Our study might provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of ginsenosides for prolonging the healthspan of natural aging mice.",

This study investigated the efficacy of a novel IP3R inhibitor, desmethylxestospongin B (dmXeB), in preventing HSC activation. Freshly isolated rat HSCs were activated in vitro in the presence of varying dmXeB concentrations. The dmXeB effectively inhibited HSC proliferation, migration, and expression of fibrosis markers without toxicity to the primary rat hepatocytes or human liver organoids. Furthermore, dmXeB preserved the quiescent phenotype of HSCs marked by retained vitamin A storage. Mechanistically, dmXeB suppressed mitochondrial respiration in activated HSCs while enhancing glycolytic activity. Notably, methyl pyruvate, dimethyl α-ketoglutarate, and nucleoside supplementation all individually restored HSC proliferation despite dmXeB treatment. Overall, dmXeB demonstrates promising anti-fibrotic effects by inhibiting HSC activation via IP3R antagonism without adverse effects on other liver cells. These findings highlight dmXeB as a potential therapeutic agent for liver fibrosis treatment, offering a targeted approach to mitigate liver fibrosis progression and its associated complications.",

      "abstract": "The primary inflammatory process in atherosclerosis, a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, begins with monocyte adhering to vascular endothelial cells. Actinidia arguta (kiwiberry) is an edible fruit that contains various bioactive components. While A. arguta extract (AAE) has been recognized for its anti-inflammatory characteristics, its specific inhibitory effect on early atherogenic events has not been clarified. We used tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for an in vitro model. AAE effectively hindered the attachment of THP-1 monocytes and reduced the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in HUVECs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that AAE treatment upregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), subsequently inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in HUVECs. AAE further hindered phosphorylation of AKT downstream of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, leading to suppression of target gene expression. Oral administration of AAE suppressed TNF-α-stimulated VCAM-1 expression, monocyte-derived macrophage infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine expression in C57BL/6 mouse aortas. Myo-inositol, identified as the major compound in AAE, played a key role in suppressing THP-1 monocyte adhesion in HUVECs. These findings suggest that AAE could serve as a nutraceutical for preventing atherosclerosis by inhibiting its initial pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "In this study, a new micro delivery system based on an anionic methacrylate copolymer, able to improve the biological response of myo-inositol by daily oral administration, was manufactured by spray-drying. It has an ideal dose form for oral administration, with an experimental drug loading (DL)% of 14% and a regulated particle size of less than 15 µm. The new formulation features an improvement on traditional formulations used as a chronic therapy for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome. The microparticles' release profile was studied and ex vivo porcine intestinal mucosa permeation experiments were performed to predict potential improvements in oral absorption. Batch n. 3, with the higher Eudragit/MI weight ratio (ratio = 6), showed the best-modified release profiles of the active ingredient, ensuring the lowest myo-inositol loss in an acidic environment. The in vivo evaluation of the myo-inositol micro delivery system was carried out in a rat animal model to demonstrate that the bioavailability of myo-inositol was increased when compared to the administration of the same dosage of the pure active ingredient. The AUC and Cmax of the loaded active molecule in the micro delivery system was improved by a minimum of 1.5 times when compared with the pure substance, administered with same dosage and route. Finally, the increase of myo-inositol levels in the ovary follicles was assessed to confirm that a daily administration of the new formulation improves myo-inositol concentration at the site of action, resulting in an improvement of about 1.25 times for the single administration and 1.66 times after 7 days of repeated administration when compared to pure MI.",

      "abstract": "Current treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are limited to toxic drug combinations of low efficacy. We recently identified an aryl-substituted fatty acid analogue, termed CTU, that effectively killed TNBC cells in vitro and in mouse xenograft models in vivo without producing toxicity. However, there was a residual cell population that survived treatment. The present study evaluated the mechanisms that underlie survival and renewal in CTU-treated MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. RNA-seq profiling identified several pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that were activated in treated cells. Increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and the cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, ELISA and Western blot analysis. Increased self-renewal was confirmed using the non-adherent, in vitro colony-forming mammosphere assay. Neutralizing antibodies to IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF, as well as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition suppressed the self-renewal of MDA-MB-231 cells post-CTU treatment. IPA network analysis identified major NF-κB and XBP1 gene networks that were activated by CTU; chemical inhibitors of these pathways and esiRNA knock-down decreased the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. NF-κB and XBP1 signaling was in turn activated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), which mediates the unfolded protein response. Co-treatment with an inhibitor of IRE1 kinase and RNase activities, decreased phospho-NF-κB and XBP1s expression and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Further, IRE1 inhibition also enhanced apoptotic cell death and prevented the activation of self-renewal by CTU. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the IRE1 ER-stress pathway is activated by the anti-cancer lipid analogue CTU, which then activates secondary self-renewal in TNBC cells.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder among reproductive-age women. As a leading cause of anovulatory infertility, it complicates fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization. The widely accepted 2003 Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for PCOS include sub-phenotypes based on variations in androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology. In this systematic review, we examined the impacts of inositol and vitamin D on fertility in PCOS. Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines, we used relevant keywords to comprehensively search databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, and MDPI. From an initial pool of 345 articles, 10 met the inclusion criteria. The articles suggest that vitamin D and inositol, particularly myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, may represent therapeutic options for PCOS. Vitamin D influences ovarian follicular development, glucose regulation, and insulin sensitivity. When combined with metformin therapy, it is associated with improved menstrual regularity and ovulation. Inositol is crucial for cellular signaling, energy metabolism, glucose regulation, and fertility. This systematic review underscores the importance of investigating inositol and vitamin D within a PCOS management strategy, given the disorder's prevalence and impacts on fertility and metabolic health. Although these agents show promise, additional research could clarify their mechanisms of action and therapeutic benefits. This review emphasizes the need for exploration of effective treatments to improve the quality of life among individuals with PCOS. Inositol and vitamin D represent potential options, but more studies are required to elucidate their roles in the management of this condition."

In order to effectively synthesize DCI in Corynebacterium glutamicum, the genes related to inositol catabolism in clusters iol1 and iol2 were knocked out in C. glutamicum SN01 to generate the chassis strain DCI-1. DCI-1 did not grow in and catabolize myo-inositol (MI). Subsequently, different exogenous and endogenous inosose isomerases were expressed in DCI-1 and their conversion ability of DCI from MI were compared. After fermentation, the strain DCI-7 co-expressing inosose isomerase IolI2 and inositol dehydrogenase IolG was identified as the optimal strain. Its DCI titer reached 3.21 g/L in the presence of 20 g/L MI. On this basis, the pH, temperature and MI concentration during whole-cell conversion of DCI by strain DCI-7 were optimized. Finally, the optimal condition that achieved the highest DCI titer of 6.96 g/L were obtained at pH 8.0, 37 °C and addition of 40 g/L MI. To our knowledge, it is the highest DCI titer ever reported.",

      "abstract": "Background Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a multifaceted complex endocrine disorder showing an alarming rise in women worldwide. Insulin resistance is the chief driving force in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Myo-inositol is an upcoming insulin-sensitizing agent, which is a second messenger responsible for insulin-mediated intracellular glucose transport. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of myo-inositol and its clinical, hormonal, and metabolic profile in treating women with PCOS. Methodology A prospective clinical study was conducted over 18 months in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Sree Balaji Medical College and Hospital, Chennai, after obtaining permission from the Institutional Ethical Committee. A total of 90 women diagnosed with PCOS, according to Rotterdam's criteria, were included in the study. They received tablet myo-inositol 1 g BD for six months. Before the start of the therapy, detailed history and baseline investigations were recorded and subsequently re-assessed at the end of six months. Results Around 68% of patients restored menstrual cycle regularity. There was a statistically significant decrease in luteinizing hormone (LH) (10.31 ± 7.92 to 7.42 ± 6.25; p = 0.002), LH/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio (2.34 ± 0.34 to 1.91 ± 0.32; p = 0.000), fasting serum insulin levels (16.71 ± 13.92 to 13.18 ± 9.41; p = 0.041), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (4.52 ± 1.34 to 2.74 ± 1.28; p = 0.041). Conclusions According to our study, it was observed that myo-inositol led to a statistically significant improvement in the hormonal and metabolic profile of PCOS patients. Moreover, it is safe and has good compliance. Hence, we can justify the addition of myo-inositol to the armamentarium for PCOS management."

Change in mental health functioning was assessed as difference between preconception baseline and 6-month post-delivery 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12v2) mental component scores. Adjusting for site, ethnicity and baseline scores, there were no robust differences in EPDS and STAI-state scores between intervention and control groups across pregnancy (n = 630) and post-delivery (n = 532).

The objective of our study was to determine the influence of myo-inositol (MI) on insulin resistance (IR), menstrual cycle regularity, and hyperandrogenism in women suffering from PCOS with normal BMI and diagnosed IR. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) that included 60 participants with PCOS who had IR and a normal BMI. Two groups were formed. A group of thirty patients received MI, and thirty patients in the control group received metformin (MET). RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in the area under the curve (AUC) of insulin values during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was recorded in both examined groups after the applied therapy with MI and MET. The regularity of the menstrual cycle in both groups was improved in >90% of patients. A statistically significant decrease in androgenic hormones (testosterone, SHBG, free androgen index-FAI, androstenedione) was recorded in both groups and did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both MI and MET can be considered very effective in the regulation of IR, menstrual cycle irregularities, and hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its consequences remain great challenges for neurology. Consequences of TBI are associated with various alterations in the brain but little is known about long-term changes of epigenetic DNA methylation patterns. Moreover, nothing is known about potential treatments that can alter these epigenetic changes in beneficial ways. Therefore, we have examined myo-inositol (MI), which has positive effects on several pathological conditions. METHODS: TBI was induced in mice by controlled cortical impact (CCI). One group of CCI animals received saline injections for two months (TBI+SAL), another CCI group received MI treatment (TBI+MI) for the same period and one group served as a sham-operated control. Mice were sacrificed 4 months after CCI and changes in DNA methylome and transcriptomes were examined. RESULTS: For the first time we: (i) provide comprehensive map of long-term DNA methylation changes after CCI in the hippocampus; (ii) identify differences by methylation sites between the groups; (iii) characterize transcriptome changes; (iv) provide association between DNA methylation sites and gene expression. MI treatment is linked with upregulation of genes covering 33 biological processes, involved in immune response and inflammation. In support of these findings, we have shown that expression of BATF2, a transcription factor involved in immune-regulatory networks, is upregulated in the hippocampus of the TBI+MI group where the BATF2 gene is demethylated. CONCLUSION: TBI is followed by long-term epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in hippocampus. MI treatment has a significant effect on these processes by modulation of immune response and biological pathways of inflammation."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of MI supplementation on oxidative stress biomarkers in obese patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, 51 newly diagnosed obese patients with NAFLD were randomly assigned to receive either MI (4 g/day) or placebo supplements accompanied by dietary recommendations for 8 weeks. Oxidative stress biomarkers, nutritional status, as well as liver enzymes and obesity indices were assessed pre- and post-intervention. A total of 48 patients completed the trial. Although anthropometric measures and obesity indices decreased significantly in both groups, the between-group differences adjusted for confounders were non-significant for these parameters, except for weight (p = .049); greater decrease was observed in the MI group. Iron and zinc intakes decreased significantly in both groups; however, between-group differences were non-significant at the end of the study. No significant between-group differences were revealed for other antioxidant micronutrients at the study endpoint. Sense of hunger, feeling to eat, desire to eat sweet and fatty foods reduced significantly in both groups (p < .05), while the feeling of satiety increased significantly in the placebo group (p = .002). No significant between-group differences were observed for these parameters, except for desire to eat fatty foods; a greater decrease was observed in the MI group (p = .034). Serum levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) significantly increased in both study groups (p < .05); however, the between-group differences were non-significant at the end of the study. Furthermore, the between-group differences were non-significant for other oxidative stress biomarkers, except for serum nitric oxide (NO) level; a greater decrease was observed in the MI group. MI supplementation could significantly improve weight, desire to eat fatty foods, serum levels of NO, as well as the aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT ratio."

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the frequency of metabolic abnormalities in PCOS patients and the effects of myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI), in a 40:1 ratio on hormonal and metabolic parameters. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four women with PCOS phenotype A (endocrine-metabolic syndrome [EMS-type 1]) between the ages of 20-40. DESIGN: Open prospective study with phenotype A (EMS-type I, n = 34) supplemented with 2,255 mg/day of inositol (MI and DCI in a 40:1 ratio) for 3 months. METHODS: The following were measured before and after treatment: serum levels of follicular stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, total and free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), free androgen index (FAI), anti-Müllerian hormone, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: 55.9% of the enrolled patients were overweight or obese, 50% affected by IR, 17.6% with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, and 61.8% had familial diabetes mellitus. At the conclusion of the study, BMI (p = 0.0029), HOMA-IR (p &lt; 0.001) significantly decreased, along with decreased numbers of patients with elevated insulin levels. The supplementation resulted in decreased total testosterone (p &lt; 0.001), free testosterone (p &lt; 0.001), FAI (p &lt; 0.001), and LH (p &lt; 0.001); increased SHBG (p &lt; 0.001) and estradiol (p &lt; 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The present analysis was limited to a 12-week follow-up, which precluded a long-term evaluation of the effects of MI and DCI combination. Also, this period was insufficient to achieve and analyze clinical changes such as restoration of the menstrual cycle, restoration of reproductive function, and clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation improved metabolic and hormonal profile in PCOS phenotype A (EMS-type I) patients. This builds upon previous work that demonstrated that combined inositol treatment may be effective in PCOS. The study presented herein, used a reduced concentration than in prior literature; however, a significant change in hormonal and metabolic parameters was still observed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nutritional intervention preconception and throughout pregnancy has been proposed as an approach to promoting healthy postnatal weight gain in the offspring but few randomised trials have examined this. METHODS: Measurements of weight and length were obtained at multiple time points from birth to 2 years among 576 offspring of women randomised to receive preconception and antenatally either a supplement containing myo-inositol, probiotics, and additional micronutrients (intervention) or a standard micronutrient supplement (control). We examined the influence on age- and sex-standardised BMI at 2 years (WHO standards, adjusting for study site, sex, maternal parity, smoking and pre-pregnancy BMI, and gestational age), together with the change in weight, length, BMI from birth, and weight gain trajectories using latent class growth analysis. RESULTS: At 2 years, there was a trend towards lower mean BMI among intervention offspring (adjusted mean difference [aMD] - 0.14 SD [95% CI 0.30, 0.02], p = 0.09), and fewer had a BMI > 95th percentile (i.e. > 1.65 SD, 9.2% vs 18.0%, adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 0.51 [95% CI 0.31, 0.82], p = 0.006). Longitudinal data revealed that intervention offspring had a 24% reduced risk of experiencing rapid weight gain > 0.67 SD in the first year of life (21.9% vs 31.1%, aRR 0.76 [95% CI 0.58, 1.00], p = 0.047). The risk was likewise decreased for sustained weight gain > 1.34 SD in the first 2 years of life (7.7% vs 17.1%, aRR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34, 0.88], p = 0.014). From five weight gain trajectories identified, there were more intervention offspring in the \"normal\" weight gain trajectory characterised by stable weight SDS around 0 SD from birth to 2 years (38.8% vs 30.1%, RR 1.29 [95% CI 1.03, 1.62], p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with myo-inositol, probiotics, and additional micronutrients preconception and in pregnancy reduced the incidence of rapid weight gain and obesity at 2 years among offspring. Previous reports suggest these effects will likely translate to health benefits, but longer-term follow-up is needed to evaluate this.

Due to the futile degradation of endogenous adiponectin and the challenges of exogenous administration, regulatory mechanisms of adiponectin biosynthesis are of significant pharmacological interest. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report that 5-diphosphoinositol 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate (5-InsP7) generated by inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) governed circulating adiponectin levels via thiol-mediated protein quality control in the secretory pathway. IP6K1 bound to adiponectin and DsbA-L and generated 5-InsP7 to stabilize adiponectin/ERp44 and DsbA-L/Ero1-Lα interactions, driving adiponectin intracellular degradation. Depleting 5-InsP7 by either IP6K1 deletion or pharmacological inhibition blocked intracellular adiponectin degradation. Whole-body and adipocyte-specific deletion of IP6K1 boosted plasma adiponectin levels, especially its high molecular weight forms, and activated AMPK-mediated protection against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Pharmacological inhibition of 5-InsP7 biosynthesis in wild-type but not adiponectin knockout mice attenuated myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that 5-InsP7 is a physiological regulator of adiponectin biosynthesis that is amenable to pharmacological intervention for cardioprotection.",

METHODS: Non-pregnant or lactating women aged between 30 and 40 years were scheduled for laparoscopic myomectomy to treat symptoms or looking to conceive. After enrollment, patients were assigned to either (1) intervention group, assuming a total of 300 mg EGCG, 50 μg vitamin D, and 50 mg DCI divided in 2 pills per day for 3 months, or (2) control group, including untreated women scheduled to undergo laparoscopic myomectomy after 3 months. RESULTS: 91 patients completed the study. The comparison of the surgical outcomes between the intervention (n = 44) and the control (n = 47) groups revealed that the treatment significantly reduces the duration of surgery (41.93 ± 7.56 min vs 56.32 ± 10.63 min, p < 0.001). Moreover, the treatment also reduced blood loss during surgery (149.09 ± 25.40 mL vs 168.41 ± 21.34 mL, p < 0.001), resulting in treated patients having higher Hb levels at discharge 11.27 ± 0.82 mL vs 10.56 ± 0.82 mL, p < 0.01). The surgery induced an increase in AST and in total bilirubin regardless of the assigned group, and the treatment induced no change in liver function. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that EGCG plus vitamin D, and DCI could represent a safe option for women with UF scheduled for laparoscopic myomectomy, improving surgical outcomes without affecting liver functionality.",

Inositol may have insulin sensitizing effects; however, its efficacy in the management of PCOS remains indeterminate. OBJECTIVE: To inform the 2023 international evidence-based guidelines in PCOS, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of inositol, alone or in combination with other therapies, in the management of PCOS. DATA SOURCES: Medline, PsycInfo, EMBASE, All EBM, and CINAHL from inception until August 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty trials (n = 2230; 1093 intervention, 1137 control), with 19 pooled in meta-analyses were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted for hormonal, metabolic, lipids, psychological, anthropometric, reproductive outcomes, and adverse effects by 1 reviewer, independently verified by a second. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirteen comparisons were assessed, with 3 in meta-analyses. Evidence suggests benefits for myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol (DCI) for some metabolic measures and potential benefits from DCI for ovulation, but inositol may have no effect on other outcomes. Metformin may improve waist-hip ratio and hirsutism compared to inositol, but there is likely no difference for reproductive outcomes, and the evidence is very uncertain for body mass indexI. Myo-inositol likely causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events compared with metformin; however, these are typically mild and self-limited. CONCLUSION: The evidence supporting the use of inositol in the management of PCOS is limited and inconclusive. Clinicians and their patients should consider the uncertainty of the evidence together with individual values and preferences when engaging in shared decision-making regarding the use of inositol for PCOS.",

Biostimulants derived from agricultural waste offer a sustainable solution to alleviate salt-induced damage to plants and contribute to a circular and sustainable economy. In this study, we applied a combination of myo-inositol and corn steep liquor from waste sources to seedling cabbage (Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis) and investigated their effects on plant growth under NaCl-simulated salt stress. Different concentrations of myo-inositol and corn steep liquor were applied to the roots, revealing that 150 mM NaCl significantly inhibited the growth and physiological metabolism of cabbage seedlings. Substrate application of myo-inositol, corn steep liquor, and their combination materials increased biomass, photosynthetic pigments, soluble sugars, soluble proteins, and the contents of K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in cabbage under salt stress conditions, while reducing malondialdehyde, electrolyte leakage, Na+ content, and the ratios of Na+/K+, Na+/Ca2+, and Na+/Mg2+. Therefore, root application of myo-inositol, corn steep liquor, and myo-inositol-corn steep liquor combination materials enhanced photosynthesis and enhanced cabbage salt stress resistance by maintaining cell osmotic and ion balance. The most pronounced positive effects were observed in the treatment with 0.1 mL L-1 corn steep liquor +288 mg L-1 myo-inositol. This study provides a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the combined utilization of myo-inositol and corn steep liquor to boost early growth and salt resistance in crops."

Several of these carry broad side-effect profiles and are not always accepted by young girls. There is growing interest in non-hormonal therapies for PCOS. We aimed to collate the evidence on the use of myoinositol or D-chiro-inositol in the improvement of PCOS symptoms in symptomatic adolescents. CONTENT: A systematic literature review identifying key articles from inception to March 2023. Participants: Female adolescents (aged 12-19 years) with PCOS or PCOS-like features. Intervention: Myoinositol or D-chiro-inositol with or without additional interventions. Comparison: Any other treatment, including lifestyle interventions, hormonal therapy, metformin or no treatment. The main outcome measure were improvement in symptoms, quality of life and adverse effects. SUMMARY: Eight studies were included: two randomised open-label trials, one quasi-randomised and three non-randomised interventional studies, one case-control study and one cohort study. All studies showed improvements in some biochemical markers, metabolic parameters or clinical symptoms, but these were not reproducible across all studies. OUTLOOK: The benefit of myoinositol in adolescents with PCOS remains unclear, with limited high-quality evidence. This review highlights the need for robustly conducted research to inform clinical practice.",

Therefore, an exploration of the mechanism of oxaliplatin resistance formation in-depth is urgently needed. We generated oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer models by four representative compounds, and RNA-seq revealed that oxaliplatin resistance was mainly the result of cells' response to stimulus. Moreover, we proved persistent stimulus-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERs) and associated cellular senescence were the core causes of oxaliplatin resistance. In addition, we screened diverse phytochemicals for ER inhibitors in silico, identifying inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), whose strong binding was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance. Finally, we confirmed the ability of IP6 to reverse colorectal cancer chemoresistance and investigated the mechanism of IP6 in the inhibition of diphthamide modification of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and PERK activation. Our study demonstrated that oxaliplatin resistance contributed to cell senescence induced by persistently activated PERK and diphthamide modification of eEF2 levels, which were specifically reversed by combination therapy with IP6.",

      "abstract": "The intricate relationship between calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis and mitochondrial function is crucial for cellular metabolic adaptation in tumor cells. Ca2+-initiated signaling maintains mitochondrial respiratory capacity and ATP synthesis, influencing critical cellular processes in cancer development. Previous studies by our group have shown that the homocysteine-inducible ER Protein with Ubiquitin-Like Domain 1 (HERPUD1) regulates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (ITPR3) levels and intracellular Ca2+ signals in tumor cells. This study explores the role of HERPUD1 in regulating mitochondrial function and tumor cell migration by controlling ITPR3-dependent Ca2+ signals. We found HERPUD1 levels correlated with mitochondrial function in tumor cells, with HERPUD1 deficiency leading to enhanced mitochondrial activity. HERPUD1 knockdown increased intracellular Ca2+ release and mitochondrial Ca2+ influx, which was prevented using the ITPR3 antagonist xestospongin C or the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. Furthermore, HERPUD1 expression reduced tumor cell migration by controlling ITPR3-mediated Ca2+ signals. HERPUD1-deficient cells exhibited increased migratory capacity, which was attenuated by treatment with xestospongin C or BAPTA-AM. Additionally, HERPUD1 deficiency led to reactive oxygen species-dependent activation of paxillin and FAK proteins, which are associated with enhanced cell migration. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of HERPUD1 in regulating mitochondrial function and cell migration by controlling intracellular Ca2+ signals mediated by ITPR3. Understanding the interplay between HERPUD1 and mitochondrial Ca2+ regulation provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment and other pathologies involving altered energy metabolism.",

Many studies have revealed that INPP4B is upregulated or downregulated in tumors of the digestive system, and the abnormal expression of INPP4B may be attributed to the occurrence, development, and prognosis of tumors of the digestive system. This paper reviews studies on the correlations between INPP4B and digestive system tumors and the roles of INPP4B in the development of different tumors to provide a theoretical basis for further research on its molecular mechanism and clinical application. \"INPP4B\" and \"tumor\" were searched as key words in PubMed and in the CNKI series full text database retrieval system from January 2000 to August 2023. A total of 153 English-language studies and 30 Chinese-language studies were retrieved. The following enrollment criteria were applied: (1) Studies contained information on the biological structure and functions of INPP4B; (2) studies covered the influence of abnormal expression of INPP4B in digestive system tumors; and (3) studies covered the role of INPP4B in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of digestive system tumors. After excluding the literature irrelevant to this study, 61 papers were finally included in the analysis. INPP4B expression is low in gastric cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and liver cancer but it has high expression in esophageal cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gallbladder cancer. INPP4B is involved in the occurrence and development of digestive system tumors through the regulation of gene expression and signal transduction. The abnormal expression of INPP4B plays an important role in the development of digestive system tumors. Studies on INPP4B provide new molecular insights for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis evaluation of digestive system tumors."

      "abstract": "During the perinatal period, dairy cows undergo negative energy balance, resulting in elevated circulating levels of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA). Although increased blood NEFA concentrations are a physiological adaptation of early lactation, excessive NEFA in dairy cows is a major cause of fatty liver. Aberrant lipid metabolism leads to hepatic lipid accumulation and subsequently the development of fatty liver. Both inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) have been validated for their association with hepatic lipid accumulation, including their regulatory functions in calf hepatocyte insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Meanwhile, both IRE1α and JNK are involved in lipid metabolism in nonruminants. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate how IRE1α and JNK regulate lipid metabolism in bovine hepatocytes. An experiment was conducted on randomly selected 10 healthy cows (hepatic triglyceride [TG] content <1%) and 10 cows with fatty liver (hepatic TG content >5%). Liver tissue and blood samples were collected from experimental cows. Serum concentrations of NEFA and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were greater, whereas serum concentrations of glucose and milk production were lower in cows with fatty liver. The western blot results revealed that dairy cows with fatty liver had higher phosphorylation levels of JNK, c-Jun, and IRE1α in the liver tissue. Three in vitro experiments were conducted using primary calf hepatocytes isolated from 5 healthy calves (body weight: 30-40 kg; 1 d old). First, hepatocytes were treated with NEFA (1.2 mM) for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 12 h, which showed that the phosphorylated levels of JNK, c-Jun, and IRE1α increased in both linear and quadratic effects. In the second experiment, hepatocytes were treated with high concentrations of NEFA (1.2 mM) for 12 h with or without SP600125, a canonical inhibitor of JNK. Western blot results showed that SP600125 treatment could decrease the expression of lipogenesis-associated proteins (PPARγ and SREBP-1c) and increase the expression of fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-associated proteins (CPT1A and PPARα) in NEFA-treated hepatocytes. The perturbed expression of lipogenesis-associated genes (FASN, ACACA, and CD36) and FAO-associated gene ACOX1 were also recovered by JNK inhibition, indicating that JNK reduced excessive NEFA-induced lipogenesis and FAO dysregulation in calf hepatocytes. Third, short hairpin RNA targeting IRE1α (sh-IRE1α) was transfected into calf hepatocytes to silence IRE1α, and KIRA6 was used to inhibit the kinase activity of IRE1α. The blockage of IRE1α could at least partially suppressed NEFA-induced JNK activation. Moreover, the blockage of IRE1α downregulated the expression of lipogenesis genes and upregulated the expression of FAO genes in NEFA-treated hepatocytes. In conclusion, these findings indicate that targeting the IRE1α-JNK axis can reduce NEFA-induced lipid accumulation in bovine hepatocytes by modulating lipogenesis and FAO. This may offer a prospective therapeutic target for fatty liver in dairy cows.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The neurobiology of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is poorly understood, and meta-analytic consensus regarding magnetic resonance spectroscopic profiles of glutamate, choline-containing compounds, myo-inositol, and other metabolites in the condition is lacking. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we examined published findings for N-acetylaspartate, choline-containing compounds (phosphocholine+glycerophosphocholine), myo-inositol, creatine+phosphocreatine, glutamate, and glutamate+glutamine in the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsal striatum in people with TRS versus non-TRS as well as TRS versus healthy control participants (HCs) and TRS versus ultra TRS (i.e., TRS with clozapine resistance). A MEDLINE search revealed 9 articles including 239 people with pooled TRS and ultra TRS, 59 with ultra TRS, 175 with non-TRS, and 153 (HCs) that met meta-analytic criteria. RESULTS: Significant effects included higher anterior cingulate cortex phosphocholine+glycerophosphocholine and myo-inositol in the pooled TRS and ultra TRS group than in both the non-TRS group and HCs as well as higher dorsal striatal phosphocholine+glycerophosphocholine in ultra TRS versus HCs, but no differences in other regional metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: The observed metabolite profile in TRS (higher phosphocholine+glycerophosphocholine and myo-inositol signal) is consistent with the hypothesis that TRS has a neuroinflammatory component, although this meta-analysis is not a critical test of that hypothesis. A similar profile is seen in healthy aging, which is known to involve increased neuroinflammation and glial activation. Because the overall number of datasets was low, however, results should be considered preliminary and highlight the need for additional studies of brain metabolites in TRS and their possible association with inflammatory processes.",

      "abstract": "Burkitt lymphoma cells (BL) exploit antigen-independent tonic signals transduced by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) for their survival, but the molecular details of the rewired BL-specific BCR signal network remain unclear. A loss of function screen revealed the SH2 domain-containing 5`-inositol phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) as a potential modulator of BL fitness. We characterized the role of SHIP2 in BL survival in several BL cell models and show that perturbing SHIP2 function renders cells more susceptible to apoptosis, while attenuating proliferation in a BCR-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, SHIP2 deficiency did neither affect PI3K survival signals nor MAPK activity, but attenuated ATP production. We found that an efficient energy metabolism in BL cells requires phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), which is the enzymatic product of SHIP proteins. Consistently, interference with the function of SHIP1 and SHIP2 augments BL cell susceptibility to PI3K inhibition. Notably, we provide here a molecular basis of how tonic BCR signals are connected to energy supply, which is particularly important for such an aggressively growing neoplasia. These findings may help to improve therapies for the treatment of BL by limiting energy metabolism through the inhibition of SHIP proteins, which renders BL cells more susceptible to the targeting of survival signals.",

Our previous study revealed that decreased MI concentrations and increased excretion are often observed in animal models of renal injury and in patients with nephropathy. However, the role of MI supplementation in renal injury remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of MI in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). We established a model of acute kidney injury caused by cisplatin (CDDP). Male Kunming mice were randomly divided into six groups: Sham (normal saline), CDDP (15 mg/kg), + MI (150 mg/kg), + MI (300 mg/kg), + MI (600 mg/kg) and MI (600 mg/kg). Human renal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2 cells were likewise separated into six groups at random: Control (normal saline), CDDP (20 µM), + MI (200 µM), + MI (400 µM), + MI (800 µM) and MI (800 µM). After the model was established, renal function indexes were subsequently detected, and experiments such as pathological staining analysis and protein expression analysis were performed. Our results showed that cisplatin administration led to AKI and apoptosis in mice and HK-2 cells, accompanied by markedly increased levels of MIOX, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), whereas exogenous MI significantly attenuated kidney injury and HK-2 cell damage induced by cisplatin both in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting excessive apoptosis. Overall, our findings demonstrate that exogenous MI can reduce excessive apoptosis, thus playing a protective role in cisplatin-induced AKI, indicating that exogenous MI may be used as an adjunctive treatment modality in cisplatin-induced AKI.",

An excess influx of fatty acids to the liver is thought to be a pathogenic cause of insulin resistance and the development of NAFLD. Although elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFA) in plasma contribute to inducing insulin resistance and NAFLD, the molecular mechanism is not completely understood. This study aimed to determine whether inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), a regulator of insulin signaling, plays any role in FFA-induced insulin resistance in primary hepatocytes. Here, we show that excess FFA decreased IPMK expression, and blockade of IPMK decrease attenuated the FFA-induced suppression of protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH). Moreover, overexpression of IPMK prevented the FFA-induced suppression of Akt phosphorylation by insulin, while knockout of IPMK exacerbated insulin resistance in PMH. In addition, treatment with MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, inhibits FFA-induced decrease in IPMK expression and Akt phosphorylation in PMH. Furthermore, treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated the FFA-induced reduction of IPMK and restored FFA-induced insulin resistance in PMH. In conclusion, our findings suggest that excess FFA reduces IPMK expression and contributes to the FFA-induced decrease in Akt phosphorylation in PMH, leading to insulin resistance. Our study highlights IPMK as a potential therapeutic target for preventing insulin resistance and NAFLD.",

Results showed that myo-inositol at 0.5 mg/mL improved motility, acrosome integrity, and fertilization ability. It also reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and increased SMCP expression. Lower concentrations also demonstrated improved viability and reduced apoptosis and ROS levels.

      "abstract": "Inositol depletion is a hypothesized mechanism of action of mood stabilization drugs used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It was previously reported that the mood stabilizer valproate (VPA) increased phosphorylation of myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthases (MIPS), the rate limiting enzyme of inositol synthesis. Phosphosites were identified and examination of site-directed mutants suggested that phosphorylation leads to decreased enzymatic activity. In this study, we examined the extent of MIPS phosphorylation in response to VPA and used two interaction screens to identify protein kinases that interact with MIPS. Using an epitope tagged MIPS construct, we determined the fraction of phosphorylated MIPS to be very low (less than 2% of total), and we could not detect phosphorylation of untagged MIPS in response to VPA. In vitro analyses of phosphorylation revealed that putative protein kinases, PKC and CKII, have low specificity toward MIPS. These findings suggest that VPA likely depletes inositol via a mechanism other than MIPS phosphorylation. Consistent with this, mRNA levels of the MIPS-encoding gene INO1 and MIPS protein levels were significantly reduced during the mid-log growth phase in response to VPA treatment. These findings suggest that the mechanism whereby VPA causes inositol depletion is by reducing expression of the rate-limiting enzyme MIPS.",

      "abstract": "Water-soluble myo-inositol phosphates have long been characterized as second messengers. The signaling properties of these compounds are determined by the number and arrangement of phosphate groups on the myo-inositol backbone. Recently, higher inositol phosphates with pyrophosphate groups were recognized as signaling molecules. 5-Diphosphoinositol 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate (5PP-InsP5) is the most abundant isoform, constituting more than 90% of intracellular inositol pyrophosphates. 5PP-InsP5 can be further phosphorylated to 1,5-bisdiphosphoinositol 2,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate (InsP8). These two molecules, 5PP-InsP5 and InsP8, are present in various subcellular compartments, where they participate in regulating diverse cellular processes such as cell death, energy homeostasis, and cytoskeletal dynamics. The synthesis and metabolism of inositol pyrophosphates are subjected to tight regulation, allowing for their highly specific functions. Blocking the 5PP-InsP5/InsP8 signaling pathway by inhibiting the biosynthesis of 5PP-InsP5 demonstrates therapeutic benefits in preclinical studies, and thus holds promise as a therapeutic approach for certain diseases treatment, such as metabolic disorders.",

METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into normal, sham operation, model, moxibustion （Moxi） and medication groups （n=12）. The VD model was established by permanent ligation of bilateral common carotid arteries. For rats of the Moxi group, mild moxibustion was given to \"Baihui\" （GV20）, \"Dazhui\" （GV14） and \"Fengfu\" （GV16） for 20 min each point, once a day for consecutive 6 days per week, for a total of 4 weeks. For rats of the medication group, intragastric perfusion of nimodipine was given 3 times each day with total dose of 2 mg•kg-1•d-1 for 4 weeks. Morris water maze test was used to detect the learning and memory ability of rats before and after modeling as well as after intervention. The apoptosis rate of nerve cells in hippocampal CA1 region was detected by TUNEL staining. The proteins and mRNA expression levels of IRE1, XBP1, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 （Bcl-2）, Bcl-2 associated X protein （Bax） in hippocampal CA1 region were detected by Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the sham operation group, the average escape latency was significantly prolonged （P<0.01）, the number of times crossing the original platform was significantly reduced （P<0.01）, the apoptosis rate of nerve cells in hippocampal CA1 region was significantly increased （P<0.01）, the proteins and mRNA expression levels of IRE1, XBP1 and Bax were significantly increased （P<0.01）, and the expression levels of Bcl-2 protein and mRNA were significantly decreased （P<0.01） in rats of the model group. After treatment, compared with the model group, the average escape latency was significantly shortened （P<0.01）, the number of times crossing the original platform was increased （P<0.05）, the apoptosis rate of nerve cells in hippocampal CA1 region was significantly decreased （P<0.01）, the protein and mRNA expression levels of IRE1, XBP1 and Bax were decreased （P<0.05, P<0.01）, and the expression levels of Bcl-2 protein and mRNA were increased （P<0.05, P<0.01） in rats of the Moxi group and medication group. There was no significant difference in the above indexes between the Moxi group and the medication group. CONCLUSION: Moxibustion at the acupoints of Governor Vessel can improve the cognitive function of VD rats, and its mechanism may be related to regulating IRE1/XBP1 pathway, inhibiting the release of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and thus inhibiting the apoptosis of hippocampal nerve cells.",

      "abstract": "Well-regulated placental palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA) metabolism is vital for optimal placental function and fetal development, but dysregulation occurs with gestational diabetes (GDM). We hypothesized that such dysregulation might arise from increased maternofetal glucose, leptin or insulin concentrations present in GDM, and that dysregulated PA and OA lipid metabolism could be moderated by myo-inositol, a natural polyol and potential GDM intervention. Placental explants from 21 women were incubated with stable isotope-labelled 13 C-PA or 13 C-OA for 48 h. Explants were treated with glucose (5, 10 mm) or leptin (13 nm) or insulin (150 nm) in combination with myo-inositol (0.3, 30, 60 μm). Forty-seven 13 C-PA lipids and 37 13 C-OA lipids were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). Compared with controls (5 mm glucose), glucose (10 mm) increased 19 13 C-OA lipids and nine 13 C-PA lipids, but decreased 13 C-OA phosphatidylethanolamine 38:5 and 13 C-PA phosphatidylethanolamine 36:4. The effects of leptin and insulin were less prominent than glucose, with leptin increasing 13 C-OA acylcarnitine 18:1, and insulin increasing four 13 C-PA triacylglycerides. Most glucose, leptin and insulin-induced alterations in lipids were attenuated by co-incubation with myo-inositol (30 or 60 μm), with attenuation also occurring in all subgroups stratified by GDM status and fetal sex. However, glucose-induced increases in acylcarnitine were not attenuated by myo-inositol and were even exaggerated in some instances. Myo-inositol therefore appears to generally act as a moderator, suppressing the perturbation of lipid metabolic processes by glucose, leptin and insulin in placenta in vitro. Whether myo-inositol protects the fetus and pregnancy from unfavourable outcomes requires further research. KEY POINTS: Incubation of placental explants with additional glucose, or to a lesser extent insulin or leptin, alters the placental production of 13 C-lipids from 13 C-palmitic acid (PA) and 13 C-oleic acid (OA) in vitro compared with untreated controls from the same placenta. Co-incubation with myo-inositol attenuated most alterations induced by glucose, insulin or leptin in 13 C-lipids, but did not affect alterations in 13 C-acylcarnitines. Alterations induced by glucose and leptin in 13 C-PA triacylglycerides and 13 C-PA phospholipids were influenced by fetal sex and gestational diabetes status, but were all still attenuated by myo-inositol co-incubation. Insulin differently affected 13 C-PA triacylglycerides and 13 C-PA phospholipids depending on fetal sex, with alterations also attenuated by myo-inositol co-incubation.",

      "abstract": "Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are energetic signaling molecules with important functions in mammals. As their biosynthesis depends on ATP concentration, PP-InsPs are tightly connected to cellular energy homeostasis. Consequently, an increasing number of studies involve PP-InsPs in metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, aspects of tumorigenesis, and hyperphosphatemia. Research conducted in yeast suggests that the PP-InsP pathway is activated in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the precise modulation of PP-InsPs during cellular ROS signaling is unknown. Here, we report how mammalian PP-InsP levels are changing during exposure to exogenous (H2O2) and endogenous ROS. Using capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS), we found that PP-InsP levels decrease upon exposure to oxidative stressors in HCT116 cells. Application of quinone drugs, particularly β-lapachone (β-lap), under normoxic and hypoxic conditions enabled us to produce ROS in cellulo and to show that β-lap treatment caused PP-InsP changes that are oxygen-dependent. Experiments in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells deficient of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) demonstrated that β-lap requires NQO1 bioactivation to regulate the cellular metabolism of PP-InsPs. Critically, significant reductions in cellular ATP concentrations were not directly mirrored in reduced PP-InsP levels as shown in NQO1-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells treated with β-lap. The data presented here unveil unique aspects of β-lap pharmacology and its impact on PP-InsP levels. The identification of different quinone drugs as modulators of PP-InsP synthesis will allow the overall impact on cellular function of such drugs to be better appreciated.",

      "abstract": "Effects of micronutrients on brain connectivity are incompletely understood. Analyzing human milk samples across global populations, we identified the carbocyclic sugar myo-inositol as a component that promotes brain development. We determined that it is most abundant in human milk during early lactation when neuronal connections rapidly form in the infant brain. Myo-inositol promoted synapse abundance in human excitatory neurons as well as cultured rat neurons and acted in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, myo-inositol enhanced the ability of neurons to respond to transsynaptic interactions that induce synapses. Effects of myo-inositol in the developing brain were tested in mice, and its dietary supplementation enlarged excitatory postsynaptic sites in the maturing cortex. Utilizing an organotypic slice culture system, we additionally determined that myo-inositol is bioactive in mature brain tissue, and treatment of organotypic slices with this carbocyclic sugar increased the number and size of postsynaptic specializations and excitatory synapse density. This study advances our understanding of the impact of human milk on the infant brain and identifies myo-inositol as a breast milk component that promotes the formation of neuronal connections.",

However, research on the effects of pinitol on osteoporosis in vivo is still limited. The present study investigated the protective effects of pinitol on ovariectomized mice and attempted to elucidate this mechanism in vivo. Four-week-old female ovariectomized ICR mice were employed as a postmenopausal osteoporosis model and treated with pinitol or estradiol (E2) for 7 wk. Thereafter, serum calcium content, phosphorus content, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAcP) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase activity (BALP) were measured. Bilateral femurs were isolated, and bone marrow protein was collected through centrifuge. Dry femurs were weighed, while femur length, cellular bones, and bone mineral content were measured. D-chiro-Inositol (DCI) and myo-inositol (MI) content in serum and bone marrow was measured by GC-MS. At the end of experiment, the serum BALP and TRAcP activities of the OVX mice were suppressed significantly by treatment with either pinitol or E2. Femur weight, cellular bone rate, Ca and P content were improved by pinitol or E2. The DCI content of the serum of OVX decreased significantly, although it recovered to some extent after pinitol treatment. Pinitol significantly increased the ratio of DCI to MI in serum or bone marrow protein in the observed OVX mice. Besides, pinitol had no significant effects on osteoblast viability and differentiation. The present results showed that continuous pinitol intake exerts potent anti-osteoporosis activity via elevating DCI content in serum and bone marrow in OVX mice.",

We enrolled women with simple endometrial hyperplasia without atypia and related symptoms, including abnormal uterine bleeding. We treated the patients with one tablet per day, containing 600 mg of D-chiro-inositol for six months. Patients underwent ultrasound to assess the thickness of the endometrium at baseline, after three months, and at the end of this study. Endometrial thickness went from 10.82 ± 1.15 mm to 8.00 ± 0.81 mm after three months (p < 0.001) and to 6.9 ± 1.06 mm after six months (p < 0.001 versus baseline; p < 0.001 versus three months). D-chiro-inositol treatment also improved heavy menstrual bleeding and the length of menstruation.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to evaluate whether patients presenting different PCOS phenotypes, treated for 6 months with myo-Ins, might exhibit a differential response to the treatment. On this premise, we clustered women with PCOS phenotypes A, B, and C in the first study group (hyperandrogenic PCOS or H-PCOS), and women presenting PCOS phenotype D in a separate study group (non-hyperandrogenic PCOS or NH-PCOS) to evaluate if the presence of hyperandrogenism, shared by H-PCOS, might imply a metabolic/endocrine condition rather than a gynecological issue. RESULTS: The administration of myo-Ins induced a significant improvement in metabolic and endocrine parameters in H-PCOS, while the effects on NH-PCOS were negligible. Additionally, myo-Ins treatment improved the endometrial thickness of H-PCOS. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects selected for the study exhibited a differential response to myo-Ins therapy according to their PCOS phenotypes. The data suggest that the same treatment might not equally improve the parameters of the PCOS condition in each sub-group of patients. It is crucial to distinguish the various phenotypes to properly select the therapeutical approach."

The combination with the milk protein α-lactalbumin can be a useful therapeutic approach to overcome inositol resistance and achieve ovulation in these women. This open-label prospective study aimed to compare the effects of supplementing myo-inositol plus α-lactalbumin vs myo-inositol alone on reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in PCOS. A total of 50 anovulatory women with a PCOS diagnosis were randomly assigned to receive myo-inositol alone or a combination of myo-inositol and α-lactalbumin for three months. Anthropometric measures, hormonal levels, and menstrual cycle duration were collected at baseline and after treatment. The therapy with myo-inositol plus α-lactalbumin improved both ovulation rate and menstrual cycle duration more than myo-inositol alone. The body weight was significantly reduced in women receiving myo-inositol plus α-lactalbumin, while patients in the myo-inositol group experienced no change. In addition, the improvement of hyperandrogenism was more prominent in patients treated with myo-inositol plus α-lactalbumin. The benefits of associating myo-inositol and α-lactalbumin clearly make this combination a true edge in the management of PCOS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inositol is a potential new therapeutic agent for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but its effectiveness is still controversial. The aim of the report was to evaluate the effectiveness of inositol to preventing or reducing the severity of GDM. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EmBase, Web of science, Cochrane library databases, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of inositol supplementation to prevent and treat GDM. This meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 7 RCTs (1319 pregnant women at high risk of GDM) were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found that inositol supplementation resulted in a significantly lower incidence of GDM in the inositol versus the control group (odds ratio [OR] 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.67; P = 0.0005). The inositol group had improved fasting glucose oral glucose tolerance test (FG OGTT; mean difference [MD] = - 3.20; 95% CI - 4.45 to - 1.95; P < 0.00001), 1-h OGTT (MD = - 7.24; 95% CI - 12.23 to - 2.25; P = 0.004), and 2-h OGTT (MD = - 7.15; 95% CI - 12.86 to - 1.44; P = 0.01) results. Inositol also reduced the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18-0.75; P = 0.006) and preterm birth (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18-0.69; P = 0.003). A meta-analysis of 4 RCTs including 320 GDM patients showed that the patients' insulin resistance (P < 0.05) and neonatal hypoglycemia risk (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.88; P = 0.04) were lower in the inositol than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Inositol supplementation during pregnancy has the potential to prevent GDM, improve glycemic control, and reduce preterm birth rates.",

      "abstract": "Phosphate ester analogs in which the bridging oxygen is replaced with a methylene or fluoromethylene group are well known non-hydrolyzable mimics of use as inhibitors and substrate analogs for reactions involving phosphate esters. Properties of the replaced oxygen are often best mimicked by a mono-fluoromethylene group, but such groups are challenging to synthesize and can exist as two stereoisomers. Here, we describe the protocol for our method of synthesizing the α-fluoromethylene analogs of d-glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), as well as the methylene and difluoromethylene analogs, and their application in the study of 1l-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (mIPS). mIPS catalyzes the synthesis of 1l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate (mI1P) from G6P, in an NAD-dependent aldol cyclization. Its key role in myo-inositol metabolism makes it a putative target for the treatment of several health disorders. The design of these inhibitors allowed for the possibility of substrate-like behavior, reversible inhibition, or mechanism-based inactivation. In this chapter, the synthesis of these compounds, expression and purification of recombinant hexahistidine-tagged mIPS, the mIPS kinetic assay and methods for determining the behavior of the phosphate analogs in the presence of mIPS, and a docking approach to rationalizing the observed behavior are described.",

      "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by airway hypersensitivity and remodeling. The current treatments provide only short-term benefits and may have undesirable side effects; thus, alternative or supplementary therapy is needed. Because intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling plays an essential role in regulating the contractility and remodeling of airway smooth muscle cells, the targeting of Ca2+ signaling is a potential therapeutic strategy for asthma. Houttuynia cordata is a traditional Chinese herb that is used to treat asthma due to its anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that H. cordata might modulate intracellular Ca2+ signaling and could help relieve asthmatic airway remodeling. We found that the mRNA and protein levels of inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) were elevated in interleukin-stimulated primary human bronchial smooth muscle cells and a house dust mite-sensitized model of asthma. The upregulation of IP3R expression enhanced intracellular Ca2+ release upon stimulation and contributed to airway remodeling in asthma. Intriguingly, pretreatment with H. cordata essential oil rectified the disruption of Ca2+ signaling, mitigated asthma development, and prevented airway narrowing. Furthermore, our analysis suggested that houttuynin/2-undecanone could be the bioactive component in H. cordata essential oil because we found similar IP3R suppression in response to the commercially available derivative sodium houttuyfonate. An in silico analysis showed that houttuynin, which downregulates IP3R expression, binds to the IP3 binding domain of IP3R and may mediate a direct inhibitory effect. In summary, our findings suggest that H. cordata is a potential alternative treatment choice that may reduce asthma severity by targeting the dysregulation of Ca2+ signaling.",

METHODS: Sixty children with ISS were randomly divided into observation and control groups (N = 30). Each group was given lysine-inositol VB12 oral solution (10 mL bid). Simultaneously, the observation group exercised following the \"ISS exercise instruction sheet\". The height (H), growth velocity (GV), height standard deviation score (HtSDS) and other indicators were compared after 6 and 12 months of intervention, respectively. After 12 months of intervention, the biochemical indicators of the two groups, together with the correlation between the average days of exercise per week and average minutes of exercise per day, GV and serum growth hormone were analyzed. RESULTS: After 6 and 12 months of treatment, the GV, serum GHRH, GHBP, GH, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 levels in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group, and HtSDS was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.01). After 12 months of treatment, the height of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the biochemical indicators between two groups (P>0.05). Average days of exercise per week and average minutes of exercise per day were positively correlated with GV and GHBP levels. Serum GHRH, GH, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 levels were negatively correlated. Average minutes of exercise per day were negatively correlated with GV and GHBP levels. Serum GHRH, GH, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 levels were positively correlated. CONCLUSION: Regular and moderate stretching exercises combined with lysine-inositol VB12 can effectively promote height growth of children with ISS, which is clinically safe. The mechanism promotes serum GHRH, GHBP, GH, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 levels.",

      "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is a growth-limiting nutrient for plants, which is taken up by root tissue from the environment as inorganic phosphate (Pi). To maintain an appropriate status of cellular Pi, plants have developed sophisticated strategies to sense the Pi level and modulate their root system architecture (RSA) under the ever-changing growth conditions. However, the molecular basis underlying the mechanism remains elusive. Inositol polyphosphate kinase (IPK2) is a key enzyme in the inositol phosphate metabolism pathway, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of IP3 into IP5 by consuming ATP. In this study, the functions of a rice inositol polyphosphate kinase gene (OsIPK2) in plant Pi homeostasis and thus physiological response to Pi signal were characterized. As a biosynthetic gene for phytic acid in rice, overexpression of OsIPK2 led to distinct changes in inositol polyphosphate profiles and an excessive accumulation of Pi levels in transgenic rice under Pi-sufficient conditions. The inhibitory effects of OsIPK2 on root growth were alleviated by Pi-deficient treatment compared with wild-type plants, suggesting the involvement of OsIPK2 in the Pi-regulated reconstruction of RSA. In OsIPK2-overexpressing plants, the altered acid phosphatase (APase) activities and misregulation of Pi-starvation-induced (PSI) genes were observed in roots under different Pi supply conditions. Notably, the expression of OsIPK2 also altered the Pi homeostasis and RSA in transgenic Arabidopsis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that OsIPK2 plays an important role in Pi homeostasis and RSA adjustment in response to different environmental Pi levels in plants.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myo-inositol (or inositol) and its derivatives not only function as important metabolites for multiple cellular processes but also act as co-factors and second messengers in signaling pathways. Although inositol supplementation has been widely studied in various clinical trials, little is known about its effect on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Recent studies have demonstrated that IPF lung fibroblasts display arginine dependency due to loss of argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1). However, the metabolic mechanisms underlying ASS1 deficiency and its functional consequence in fibrogenic processes are yet to be elucidated. METHODS: Metabolites extracted from primary lung fibroblasts with different ASS1 status were subjected to untargeted metabolomics analysis. An association of ASS1 deficiency with inositol and its signaling in lung fibroblasts was assessed using molecular biology assays. The therapeutic potential of inositol supplementation in fibroblast phenotypes and lung fibrosis was evaluated in cell-based studies and a bleomycin animal model, respectively. RESULTS: Our metabolomics studies showed that ASS1-deficient lung fibroblasts derived from IPF patients had significantly altered inositol phosphate metabolism. We observed that decreased inositol-4-monophosphate abundance and increased inositol abundance were associated with ASS1 expression in fibroblasts. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of ASS1 expression in primary normal lung fibroblasts led to the activation of inositol-mediated signalosomes, including EGFR and PKC signaling. Treatment with inositol significantly downregulated ASS1 deficiency-mediated signaling pathways and reduced cell invasiveness in IPF lung fibroblasts. Notably, inositol supplementation also mitigated bleomycin-induced fibrotic lesions and collagen deposition in mice. CONCLUSION: These findings taken together demonstrate a novel function of inositol in fibrometabolism and pulmonary fibrosis. Our study provides new evidence for the antifibrotic activity of this metabolite and suggests that inositol supplementation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for IPF.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that myo-inositol (MI) has a critical role in reducing renal inflammatory processes and improving podocyte function and preventing diabetes-related renal damage. We aimed to explore the function and underlying workings of MI in renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF). Based on a mouse model, we explored the effect of MI in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-treated HK-2 cells. Pathological changes of the kidney tissues were examined following staining of the tissues with hematoxylin, eosin, and Masson's trichrome. The mRNA quantities of fibrosis markers, fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen I, were analyzed by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction, whereas those of protein levels were assessed with Western blotting. We also determined the expression of collagen I by immunofluorescence, and the levels of phosphorylated phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) by Western blot. In vivo, histopathological examination in the UUO mice revealed renal tubular epithelial cell necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and RIF. UUO mice showed higher expression levels of collagen I, fibronectin, α-SMA, pPI3K, and pAKT compared with sham-operated mice. However, MI treatment diminished the pathological alterations of RIF in UUO mice and downregulated the expression of fibrosis markers and phosphorylated PI3K/AKT. In vitro, TGF-β1 positively influenced the propagation and differentiation of HK-2 cells and upregulated the levels of α-SMA, fibronectin, collagen I, pPI3K, and pAKT, but these became significantly reversed by MI treatment. In conclusion, MI ameliorates RIF, possibly by negatively regulating TGF-β1-induced epithelial transdifferentiation and PI3K/AKT activation.",
