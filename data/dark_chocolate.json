      "abstract": "Background: Hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle can significantly impair physical performance, neuromuscular function, and cognitive processing in female athletes, particularly during the premenstrual phase. Emerging evidence suggests that dark chocolate (DC), rich in flavonoids, polyphenols, magnesium, and theobromine, may exert anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and neuroprotective effects. This study investigated the acute effects of 85% DC supplementation on cognitive and physical performance, as well as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), in female CrossFit® athletes across four distinct hormonal phases. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, fifteen trained eumenorrheic female CrossFit® athletes completed three intervention conditions: dark chocolate (DC), placebo (PLA), and control (CON). Participants were evaluated during four distinct menstrual phases-menstrual, follicular, luteal, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS)-over three consecutive menstrual cycles. In each phase, participants consumed 30 g/day of either DC or PLA for three days, followed by performance testing on day four. Functional and cognitive performance were assessed via the CINDY WOD, handgrip strength (HGS), and Stroop tests (reaction time and correct answer percentage, CAP). DOMS was measured using a 100 mm visual analog scale at baseline and at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-exercise. Results: DC supplementation significantly improved functional performance (CINDY WOD) across all menstrual phases, with the greatest enhancement during PMS (p < 0.01). Reaction time significantly improved during PMS (p = 0.010 vs. control; p = 0.002 vs. placebo). Additionally, DOMS was notably reduced in the luteal phase at 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h post-exercise in the DC condition compared to the control and placebo (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in HGS across conditions or phases (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Short-term DC supplementation may selectively enhance high-intensity functional performance and cognitive accuracy in trained female athletes, particularly during hormonally sensitive phases such as PMS. Its anti-inflammatory and neuromodulatory properties make DC a promising, non-pharmacological strategy to support female-centric recovery and performance in CrossFit® and similar sports. Future research should explore chronic intake, mechanistic biomarkers, and individual variability across menstrual cycles.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dark chocolate, rich in flavanols, may support vascular health by reducing arterial stiffness and blood pressure across menstrual phases. This study examined the effects of 85% dark chocolate on nitric oxide (NO) levels and vascular function during high-intensity resistance exercise in healthy women across the early follicular and mid-luteal phases. METHODS: Thirty-one healthy women (aged 20-30 years) with regular menstrual cycles completed a randomized, crossover study (conducted at National Chung Cheng University, Sep-Dec 2023). Participants consumed either 85% dark chocolate or milk chocolate (1 g/kg body weight) before high-intensity resistance exercise during the early follicular (days 2-5) and mid-luteal (days 18-24) phases of two menstrual cycles. Finger-toe pulse wave velocity (ftPWV), arterial stiffness, blood pressure, and plasma NO levels were measured at rest, 2 h after chocolate consumption (baseline), immediately post-exercise (T0), and at 60 (T60) and 120 (T120) minutes post-exercise. RESULTS: Dark chocolate supplementation significantly increased NO levels and reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP), ftPWV, and arterial pressure volume index (API) (p < 0.05) compared to milk chocolate across both menstrual phases. During the early follicular phase, dark chocolate also attenuated exercise-induced increases in arterial stiffness and blood pressure (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: 85% dark chocolate supplementation may reduce the negative vascular effects of high-intensity resistance exercise, particularly by lowering blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and API, especially in the early follicular phase. These findings suggest that dark chocolate could be a practical, non-pharmacological intervention for improving cardiovascular health in women. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06908941.

      "abstract": "Cocoa that is abundant in dark chocolate is known for its anti-inflammatory effects that are mainly due to biologically active ingredients like polyphenols and methylxanthines. We here provide a comprehensive literature survey of both, in vitro and in vivo studies including clinical trials summarizing recent evidence on the immune-modulatory effects exerted by application of cocoa-rich dark chocolate or distinct cocoa-derived molecules. The survey revealed that dark chocolate and its derivatives could effectively dampen pro-inflammatory including oxidative stress responses in vascular diseases including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and decompression sickness, metabolic morbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, chronic kidney diseases, and polycystic ovary syndrome, enhance gut epithelial barrier function, and modulate pain sensations. On the other hand, dark chocolate consumption intake was found to worsen acne symptoms. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with dark chocolate with high contents of biologically active polyphenols and methylxanthines might be promising adjunct immune-modulatory treatment options of distinct acute as well as chronic inflammatory morbidities that need to be evaluated in more detail in future in vivo including clinical studies."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Magnesium (Mg2+) deficiency can be observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with increased inflammation, disease progression, and mortality. Dark chocolate is an excellent source of Mg2+. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 70% cocoa chocolate intake on Mg2+ serum levels in patients with CKD on hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: These are secondary analyses from a previous controlled pilot study. The study included 59 patients undergoing HD. Patients were allocated into 2 groups: dark chocolate and the control group. The dark chocolate group received 40 g of 70% cocoa chocolate for 2 months during HD sessions (3 times a week). The control group did not receive any intervention. Mg2+ was evaluated by a colorimetric test using a commercial kit (Bioclin®). NCT04600258 on March 1, 2020, retrospectively registered. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients in the dark chocolate group (17 women, 53.4 ± 12.9 years) and 11 in the control group (4 women, 46.7 ± 10.9 years) completed the study. The median (interquartile range) overall Mg2+ serum levels were 2.4 (0.4) mg/dL, with no significant differences between the groups. After 2 months of supplementation, serum levels of Mg2+ increased significantly in the dark chocolate group from 2.5 (2.4-2.6) to 2.7 (2.6-2.8) mg/dL (P < .01). No change was observed in potassium and phosphorus plasma levels. CONCLUSIONS: Dark chocolate might be a promising nutritional strategy to improve Mg2+ levels in patients with CKD on HD. The offered dose was safe, not altering plasma phosphorus and potassium levels."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress and inflammation play critical roles in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases. Dark chocolate (DC)/cocoa, as a rich source of polyphenols like flavonoids, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may confer health benefits, but findings in this context are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the controlled trials (CTs) that have examined the effects of DC/cocoa on oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers in adults. SEARCH METHODS: Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, were searched for relevant studies through April 2024. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies assessed C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), P-selectin, E-selectin and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in adults were included. DATA ANALYSIS: Based on the random-effects model, we calculated WMDs, SMDs and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity, sub-group, meta-regression and dose-response analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: Thirty-three eligible CTs with 1379 participants were included. All studies reported the intervention types (cocoa powder, beverages and chocolate bars) and dosage. However, sixteen studies didn't do/report testing for purity and potency by independent groups. Also, none of the studies mentioned the risk of contamination with heavy metals. Another limitation was the lack of blinding assessment in studies. DC/cocoa significantly reduced MDA (SMD: -0.69, 95 %CI: -1.17, -0.2, p = 0.005) and increased NO levels (SMD: 2.43, 95 %CI: 1.11,3.75, p < 0.001); However, it has no significant effects on the other outcomes. Greater anti-inflammatory effects occurred at higher flavonoid doses (>450 mg/day) and for shorter durations (≤4 weeks) in the non-healthy participants. Non-linear dose-response relationships between cocoa dosage and CRP level and also between flavonoid dosage and IL-6 level were observed. Based on the GRADE evaluation, just CRP and MDA results were considered as high certainty evidence and the other outcomes results were categorized as very low to moderate certainty. CONCLUSIONS: DC/cocoa may improve systemic oxidative status and inflammation in adults. However, further studies should be performed to determine its benefits.",

      "abstract": "Previous intervention studies have shown some benefits of dark chocolate for the cardiovascular system, but it has not been established whether dark chocolate intake is associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). To investigate the causality between dark chocolate intake and the risk of CVDs, a Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted. We obtained summary-level data on dark chocolate intake and CVDs from publicly available genome-wide association studies. In this MR study, the main approach was to use a fixed-effect model with inverse variance weighted (IVW) and evaluate the robustness of the results via sensitivity analysis. We found that dark chocolate intake was significantly associated with the reduction of the risk of essential hypertension (EH) (OR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.88; p = 1.06 × 10-3), as well as with the suggestive association to the reduced risk of venous thromboembolism (OR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.96; p = 2.81 × 10-2). However, no association was found between dark chocolate intake and the other ten CVDs. Our study provides evidence for a causality between dark chocolate intake and a reduced risk of EH, which has important implications for the prevention of EH in the population.",

Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available for pain relief, but information on their effectiveness, particularly regarding green coconut water, dark chocolate, and Ibuprofen, remains limited. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of green coconut water, dark chocolate bars, and Ibuprofen in reducing the intensity of primary dysmenorrhea. In this research, a randomized controlled trial with a quantitative design was conducted, involving 45 participants randomly assigned to receive 330 mL of green coconut water, 35 g of 70% dark chocolate, or 400 mg Ibuprofen. The interventions were administered on the first day of menstruation when dysmenorrhea symptoms typically occur in subjects. This study used a single-dose approach to evaluate the immediate impact of each treatment. The subjects were instructed to consume the given interventional product within 15 min. The pain intensity was measured using a Numeric Rating Scale before the intervention and 2 h after the subjects finished consuming the interventional product. The multivariate Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant difference in effectiveness among the three interventions (p < 0.05). The study found that Ibuprofen was the most effective intervention compared to the other interventions. These findings contribute to understanding the treatment options for primary dysmenorrhea and emphasize the efficacy of Ibuprofen (trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05971186).",

Food rich in polyphenols such as dark chocolate may be an effective strategy to mitigate inflammation and delay CKD complications, outwith sensorial pleasure promotion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dark chocolate on inflammation and oxidative stress markers in patients with CKD on hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: A clinical trial was carried out with 59 patients who were allocated into the chocolate group [40g of dark chocolate (70% cocoa) offered during HD sessions, 3×/week] or the control group with any intervention for two months. Plasma levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were evaluated by the ELISA method. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and LDLox levels were evaluated as lipid peroxidation markers. Routine biochemical parameters were analysed using commercial BioClin® kits. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients completed the chocolate group (18 men, 53.0 (16) years and 31.0 (39) months on HD) and 11 in the control group (7 men, 48.0 (17.5) years and 44.0 (56.5) months on HD). Regarding the differences between the groups, the patients who received dark chocolate had reduced plasma levels of TNF-α compared to the control (p = 0.008). No significant changes were observed in the oxidative stress parameters evaluated in both groups. Routine biochemical (including phosphorus and potassium levels) and anthropometric parameters and food intake were not changed after the study period. CONCLUSION: The intervention with dark chocolate (70% cocoa) for two months reduced the plasma levels of TNF-α in patients with CKD on HD. In addition, it is essential to emphasise that chocolate intake did not increase the plasma levels of phosphorus and potassium in these patients.

METHODS: In this experimental study, 32 female Wistar rats, weighing (200 ± 20) g, were randomly categorized into 4 groups including control, letrozole (1 mg·kg·d), metformin (500 mg·kg·d) along with letrozole, and DC (500 mg·kg·d) along with letrozole for 28 d by oral gavage. Twenty-four hours after the last supplementation, direct blood sampling was taken from the heart to obtain blood serum for evaluation of sex hormones and gonadotropins, oxidative parameters, inflammatory cytokines, and ovarian tissue was examined for histology. RESULTS: The DC treatment significantly improved PCOS signs, as demonstrated by the significant restoration of ovarian morphology and physiological functions as compared with the letrozole group. DC treatment also decreased ovarian interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α levels and improved total oxidative/antioxidative status as compared with the letrozole group. CONCLUSIONS: Treating the animals with DC could alleviate the PCOS symptoms and reduced the toxic effects of letrozole in the ovary. This effect may mediate through antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties.",

There was no significant inter-period difference between the mean changes of body weight, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, no significant change was confirmed in participants' blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), serum homocysteine, high-sensitive c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). It seems that the dose of FGE used in this study was not sufficient to cause any significant changes in the outcomes. Therefore, further studies with dose-response designs and longer durations are recommended.",

      "abstract": "Research has shown that both dark chocolate and exercise training may have favorable effects on antioxidant function in obese cohorts. However, their combined effect has not been established. We assessed the influences of six weeks of dark chocolate consumption combined with jump rope exercise on antioxidant markers in adolescent boys with obesity. Fifty adolescent boys with obesity (age = 15 ± 1 years) were randomly assigned into one of four groups; jump rope exercise + white chocolate consumption (JW; n = 13), jump rope exercise + dark chocolate consumption (JD; n = 13), dark chocolate consumption (DC; n = 12), or control (C; n = 12). Two participants dropped out of the study. Participants in JW and JD groups performed jump rope exercise three times per week for six weeks. Participants in the DC and JD groups consumed 30 g of dark chocolate containing 83% of cocoa during the same period. Serum concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were evaluated prior to and after the interventions. All 3 intervention groups noted significant (p < 0.01) increases in serum concentrations of TAC, SOD, and GPx from baseline to post-test. In contrast, all intervention groups showed significantly reduced serum concentrations of TBARS from pre- to post-test (p ≤ 0.01). Bonferroni post hoc analysis revealed that post-test serum concentrations of TAC in the JD group were significantly greater than C (p < 0.001), DC (p = 0.010), and JW (p < 0.001) groups. In addition, post-test serum concentrations of SOD in the JD group were significantly greater than C group (p = 0.001). Post-test serum concentrations of GPx in the JD group were significantly greater than C (p < 0.001), DC (p = 0.021), and JW (p = 0.032) groups. The post-test serum concentrations of TBARS in the JD group was significantly lower than C (p < 0.001). No other significant between-group differences were observed. The current study provides evidence that dark chocolate consumption in combination with jump rope exercise is more efficient in improving antioxidant capacity than dark chocolate consumption or jump rope exercise alone among obese adolescent boys."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is postulated that cocoa solids possess cardioprotective capacity by various mechanisms. In the different cocoa studies evaluating cardiovascular disease, there are no conclusive data on the role it plays in controlling the lipid profile and anthropometric variables, perhaps because the concentration of cocoa, the geographical origin of the population, and the different concentrations supplied lead to a high heterogeneity of results. This study aims to estimate the effect of consuming cocoa-rich chocolate compared to placebo on the lipid profile and anthropometric variables based on data from three clinical trials conducted in Colombia. METHODS: Meta-analysis of individual data from three randomized clinical trials conducted in Colombia. The entire population of the primary studies was included, which was reassigned into intervention groups if they consumed 50 grams of 70% concentrated cocoa or placebo, which was considered to be cocoa-free or with a concentration less than 50 grams. The variables at the beginning of the study were analyzed with medians, interquartile ranges, means, and deviations according to whether they met the normality assumption. Multiple imputations were used to manage missing data and were analyzed using the two approaches proposed for this type of study, that of one and two stages. In the two-stage approach, the data were weighted on a conventional Forrest plot, while in the one-stage approach, linear regressions with mixed models were applied. This study is governed by the regulations described in the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki and by article 11 of Resolution 8430 of 1993, which classifies it as a risk-free study. RESULTS: A total of 275 participants were included, who consumed cocoa or placebo for 81 days on average; 52.7% were female and few smoked at the time of the intervention (31/275). Physical activity performed in number of hours per week was comparable between the intervention groups. When evaluating total cholesterol, low-density cholesterol (LDL), high-density cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides, abdominal circumference, and final body mass index with both the one-stage and two-stage approaches, there were no significant differences between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results obtained in the meta-analysis, the consumption of cocoa in the Colombian population does not seem to significantly modify variables such as lipid profile, abdominal circumference, and body mass index. This conclusion according to the quality of the evidence has a weak recommendation and a low-to-moderate certainty. However, the analysis through the two proposed approaches yielded similar results."

      "abstract": "Obesity remains a major public health problem due to its increasing prevalence. Natural products have become common as adjunct therapeutic agents for treating obesity and preventing metabolic diseases. Cocoa and its products are commonly consumed worldwide. Dark chocolate, a rich source of polyphenols, has received attention lately for its beneficial role in the management of obesity; however, conflicting results are still being reported. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing literature on the relationship and effects of cocoa and dark chocolate intake among obese adults. We searched multiple databases for research investigating the consumption of cocoa and/or dark chocolate in managing obesity among adults. This review includes epidemiological and human studies that were published in English over the last 10 years. Our review of the current literature indicates that epidemiological and human trials with obese adults have shown inconsistent results, which may be due to the different populations of subjects, and different types of cocoa products and doses used for intervention. Studies among obese adults are mainly focusing on obese individuals with comorbidities, as such more studies are needed to elucidate the role of cocoa polyphenols in weight control and preventing the risk of chronic diseases among obese individuals without comorbidities as well as healthy individuals. Careful adjustment of confounding factors would be required. The effects of cocoa and dark chocolate intake on obese adults were discussed, and further research is warranted to identify the gaps.",

      "abstract": "We examined the effects of six weeks of dark chocolate supplementation combined with interval jump rope exercise (JRE) on inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, and body composition in obese adolescent boys. Forty-eight obese adolescent boys (age  = 15.4  ±  1.1 years and body mass index  =  32.2  ±  2.4 kg/m2) were randomly assigned into one of four groups: JRE + white chocolate (JW; n = 13), JRE + dark chocolate supplementation (JD; n = 13), dark chocolate supplementation (DS; n = 12), or control (C; n = 12). Participants in JW and JD groups performed JRE for three times per week for six weeks. Participants in the DS and JD groups consumed 30 g of dark chocolate containing 83% of cocoa. Body composition, pro-inflammatory cytokines ((hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6), adipokines (leptin, resistin, RBP-4, chemerin, MCP-1), and anti-inflammatory adipokines (irisin, adiponectin)) were evaluated prior to and after the intervention trials. All three intervention trials significantly (p < 0.05) decreased body mass, waist-hip ratio, fat mass, hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, leptin, resistin, RBP-4, and MCP-1, and increased irisin and adiponectin concentrations. The improvements in these parameters were greater in the JD group, and additionally, chemerin concentrations decreased only in the JD group. JD enhanced adiponectin concentrations and decreased IL-6 concentrations compared to C. Moreover, JD significantly reduced chemerin concentrations, an effect not observed in any of the other interventions. We demonstrated that dark chocolate supplementation potentiated JRE-induced decreases in body mass, WHR, FM, hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, leptin, resistin, RBP-4, and MCP-1, chemerin as well as increases irisin and adiponectin concentrations in obese adolescent boys. Therefore, JRE combined with dark chocolate supplementation could be a beneficial in reducing obesity-induced inflammation in adolescent boys.",

METHODS: Cognitively healthy older adults aged 65-75 years were recruited for an eight-week randomized, double-blind controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of cocoa flavanols on cognitive functions. At baseline, nutrient and polyphenol intakes from diet were assessed with three-day food diaries. The intervention group received 50 g dark chocolate containing 410 mg of flavanols per day, and the control group 50 g dark chocolate containing 86 mg of flavanols per day, for eight weeks. Cognition was assessed with Verbal Fluency (VF) and the Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B as the main outcome measures. Changes in blood lipids and glucose were also measured. RESULTS: The older adults participating numbered 100 (63% women), mean 69 y (range 65 to 74). They were highly educated with a mean 14.9 years of education (SD 3.6). No differences in changes in cognition were seen between groups. The mean change (± SEs) in the time to complete the TMT A and B in the intervention group was -4.6 s (-7.1 to -2.1) and -16.1 s (-29.1 to -3.1), and in the controls -4.4 s (-7.0 to -1.9) and -12.5 s (-22.8 to -2.1)(TMT A p = 0.93; TMT B p = 0.66). No difference was apparent in the changes in blood lipids, glucose levels, or body weight between the groups.

METHODS: In order to find relevant papers, PubMed and Scopus were searched up to November 2018. Mean differences of eligible trials were pooled using random-effects models (the Der Simonian-Laird estimator). Subgroup analysis was conducted to assess the potential source of heterogeneity. Fractional polynomial modeling was used to explore dose-response relationships. RESULTS: Seventeen studies involving 615 participants assessed the effect of dark chocolate and six included studies involving 179 participants investigated the effect of flavonoids on FMD. Chronic consumption of dark chocolate and flavan-3-ols both increased FMD (0.69, 95% CI 0.22-1.16, p < 0.001, 1.16, 95% CI 0.52-1.80 p = 0.001, respectively). Pooling chronic consumption of dark chocolate and flavonoids improved FMD (p < 0.001) with significant heterogeneity among studies (p < 0.001; I2 = 64.2%). Type of intervention (flavonoid or cocoa, p = 0.230-dark chocolate, p < 0.001) was a source of heterogeneity. Also, we found that acute consumption of dark chocolate (p < 0.001) and both dark chocolate and flavonoids (p < 0.001) had beneficial effects on FMD. Consumption of flavonoids more than 40 g/day increases FMD with the highest mean of FMD in doses around 40-60 g/day. A non-linear dose-response has been also found after the chronic consumption of dark chocolate on FMD with a greater reduction in doses lower than 20 g/day. CONCLUSION: Current evidence indicated the beneficial effect of acute and chronic consumption of dark chocolate and flavonoids on FMD. Non-linear associations should be considered when investigating the effects of dietary intakes on FMD.",

To date, much of the evidence is based on measures of executive function with extracts and cocoa-based interventions with a high flavonoid content. The aim of the present study was to explore whether benefits to episodic verbal memory and mood are observed two hours post consumption of a commercially available dark chocolate (DC) bar relative to a 35 g white chocolate bar (WC). Ninety-eight healthy young adults (n = 57 females) aged 18-24 years consumed either a 35 g DC bar or a calorie-matched low flavonoid WC bar. Verbal episodic memory and mood were assessed pre consumption and 2 h post consumption. An ANOVA analysis showed that the DC was associated with better verbal memory performance for several outcome measures of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test relative to the WC, however, there were no effects on mood. These findings lend support to the notion that everyday available portions of dark chocolate can confer benefits to the brain in healthy consumers.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: A recently reported randomized clinical trial suggested beneficial effects of vasodilating flavanols in dark chocolate on visual function without objective quantification of retinal perfusion. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of dark chocolate flavanols on subjective visual function and retinal perfusion objectively quantified on optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, masked double-blind crossover clinical trial analyzed 22 healthy participants at the Department of Ophthalmology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany, in July 2018. Analysis was intention to treat. Analysis began in July 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to consume 20 g of dark chocolate containing 400 mg of flavanols or 7.5 g of milk chocolate. Two hours later, visual function and retinal perfusion on OCT angiography were evaluated. Systemic blood pressure was measured to rule out artifacts on OCT angiography. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was macular retinal perfusion quantified as vessel density on OCT angiography. The secondary end point was subjective visual function (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity, Pelli-Robson chart, and Mars chart contrast sensitivity). RESULTS: All 22 participants (13 women [59.1%]; mean [SD] age, 27.3 [11.1] years) completed the trial. No relevant differences in baseline parameters between groups were identified. No change in the primary outcome measure, retinal perfusion, could be detected after consumption of dark vs milk chocolate (superficial plexus 48.0% vs 47.5%, treatment effect: -0.59 [95% CI, -2.68 to 1.50], P = .56; deep plexus 54.1% vs 54.0%, treatment effect: -1.14 [95% CI, -4.01 to 1.73], P = .42). No differences in changes in the secondary outcome parameters Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity, Pelli-Robson chart, or Mars chart contrast sensitivity could be detected. Potentially confounding effects of changes in blood pressure were excluded. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In contrast to a previous similarly sized randomized clinical trial reporting beneficial effects on visual function, no short-term effects of flavanol-rich dark chocolate on automatically assessed retinal blood flow on OCT angiography or subjective visual function were observed in this study. As this small trial does not rule out the possibility of benefits, further trials with larger sample sizes would be needed to rule in or out possible long-term benefits confidently.

Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important physiological role for their reparative potential of vascular integrity, but are numerically reduced and functionally impaired in patients with cardiovascular risks. This study assesses the effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) and apple-enriched dark chocolate intake on the blood levels of EPCs. Methods: Thirty volunteers with cardiovascular risk factors, enrolled in a randomised, crossover, four-weeks trial, received a solid dark chocolate bar (40 g/day) containing 10% EVOO or 2.5% dry apples. Urine samples were analyzed for endogenous metabolites. Circulating EPCs levels, clinical data and anthropometric examinations were collected. RESULTS: 26 volunteers (M/F:14/12, 51 ± 9 years of age) completed the study. Comparison of pre-post intervention revealed a significant increase in EPCs levels associated with EVOO-dark chocolate consumption. Most biochemical parameters were not significantly modified by both chocolates. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a daily consumption of a non fattening dose of dark chocolate enriched with EVOO improves blood levels of EPCs, a well known surrogate biologic marker for endothelial function."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An appropriate snack for patients with diabetes mellitus should be considered to help them in their treatment due to their hard administrative diet. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dark chocolate on inflammatory markers, serum adiponectin, and certain biochemical factors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: This study was a randomized parallel clinical trial. Thirty grams of 84% dark chocolate, along with therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLCs) guidelines, were administrated to patients with T2D. Control group received only TLC guidelines. The intervention period was 8 weeks. Twenty-one subjects in dark chocolate and 23 subjects in control group completed the study. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after the intervention period and inflammatory markers, biochemical factors, and adiponectin levels were assessed. RESULTS: Fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1C, low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels declined significantly in the dark chocolate group and this decrease was significant between the intervention and control groups. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and high sensitive C-reactive protein were significantly decreased in the dark chocolate group. Adiponectin levels were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study subjects who received dark chocolate along with TLC guidelines had lower levels of inflammatory markers such as hs-CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6, compared with the subjects who were devoid of dark chocolate and followed only the TLC guidelines. Other studies should be conducted to evaluate the most effective and administrative dosage of dark chocolate as a snack along with the common treatment of diabetes."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if ingestion of lycosome-formulated dark chocolate (DC) containing astaxanthin (ASTX) improves bioavailability of ASTX and affects markers of hypoxia and oxidative stress in aging individuals. DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, four-arm, prospective study. SETTINGS: Lycotec Ltd, Cambridge, United Kingdom and Institute of Cardiology, Saratov, Russian Federation. PARTICIPANTS: 32 healthy individuals aged 60-70 years with confirmed signs of oxidative stress (increased serum levels of oxidized LDL and malonic dialdehyde) randomized into four study groups (8 volunteers each). INTERVENTION: Volunteers of first group were given orally 10 gr of dark chocolate (DC). Individuals from the second group received 7 mg of astaxanthin (ASTX). Third group of volunteers was supplemented with 10 gr of DC and 7 mg of ASTX ingested simultaneously as two separate formulations. Last group of the individuals was given 10 gr of a lycosomal formulation of DC containing 7 mg of co-crystalized ASTX (L-DC-ASTX), a newly developed highly bioavailable nutraceutical composition of DC containing 2 groups of antioxidants (cocoa flavanols and ASTX). All formulations were given orally, once daily for a month. MEASUREMENTS: Serum ASTX was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Nitric oxide, malonic dialdehyde and oxidized LDL were quantified spectrophotometrically. Oxygenation parameters were evaluated by near-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: One month ingestion of singular formulation of ASTX lead to a 20 fold buildup in serum ASTX level whereas the 4 week ingestion of L-DC-ASTX formulation was accompanied by more prominent accumulation of ASTX in serum (a 40 fold increase over the basal values) at the same daily dose of ASTX. Both antioxidants taken separately decreased serum levels of oxidized LDL and malonic dialdehyde. However effect of L-DC-ASTX formulation was more prominent. ASTX ingested alone caused a borderline increase (p=0.054) in serum nitric oxide (NO) levels, whereas DC ingestion lead to small but statistically significant increase in serum NO concentration. Higher values of NO level were seen after co-ingestion of DC and ASTX, especially in case of L-DC-ASTX formulation suggesting additive/synergistic effects of DC and ASTX on nitric oxide production. These changes were in agreement with the increase in plasma oxygen transport and tissue oxygen saturation seen in the volunteers supplemented with L-DC-ASTX formulation. CONCLUSION: The nutraceutical formulation of DC and ASTX with an enhanced bioavailability of ASTX can be efficiently used for the correction of oxidative status in aging individuals.",

However, a thorough evaluation of chocolate phenolic profile is still lacking. This study aimed at a comprehensive characterization of dark chocolate phenolic profile, using non-targeted mass spectrometry identification. This approach allowed a tentative identification of 158 individual phenolic compounds: 67 were newly detected in dark chocolate, among these 38 were observed for the first time in chocolate as well as in cocoa beans or products. Ellagitannins, which have never been reported in cocoa or chocolate, represented about the 10% of the phenolic profile of dark chocolate. The enrichment of dark chocolate with Sakura green tea leaves or turmeric powder influenced and modified the phenolic profile, resulting in a phenolic concentration increase. In this way, this functional chocolate might maximize the beneficial effect of chocolate consumption, combining the positive health effects of chocolate, turmeric and green tea and, at the same time, reducing the amount of sugars and calories introduced with chocolate.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consumption of almonds or dark chocolate and cocoa has favorable effects on markers of coronary heart disease; however, the combined effects have not been evaluated in a well-controlled feeding study. The aim of this study was to examine the individual and combined effects of consumption of dark chocolate and cocoa and almonds on markers of coronary heart disease risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized controlled, 4-period, crossover, feeding trial was conducted in overweight and obese individuals aged 30 to 70 years. Forty-eight participants were randomized, and 31 participants completed the entire study. Each diet period was 4 weeks long, followed by a 2-week compliance break. Participants consumed each of 4 isocaloric, weight maintenance diets: (1) no treatment foods (average American diet), (2) 42.5 g/d of almonds (almond diet [ALD]), (3) 18 g/d of cocoa powder and 43 g/d of dark chocolate (chocolate diet [CHOC]), or (4) all 3 foods (CHOC+ALD). Compared with the average American diet, total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after the ALD were lower by 4%, 5%, and 7%, respectively (P<0.05). The CHOC+ALD decreased apolipoprotein B by 5% compared with the average American diet. For low-density lipoprotein subclasses, compared with the average American diet, the ALD showed a greater reduction in large buoyant low-density lipoprotein particles (-5.7±2.3 versus -0.3±2.3 mg/dL; P=0.04), whereas the CHOC+ALD had a greater decrease in small dense low-density lipoprotein particles (-12.0±2.8 versus -5.3±2.8 mg/dL; P=0.04). There were no significant differences between diets for measures of vascular health and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that consumption of almonds alone or combined with dark chocolate under controlled-feeding conditions improves lipid profiles. Incorporating almonds, dark chocolate, and cocoa into a typical American diet without exceeding energy needs may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.

We performed a randomized controlled crossover intervention trial to assess the acute effects of consumption of flavan-3-ol-enriched dark chocolate, compared with standard dark chocolate and white chocolate, on the human metabolome. We assessed the metabolome in urine and blood plasma samples collected before and at 2 and 6 h after consumption of chocolates in 42 healthy volunteers using a nontargeted metabolomics approach. Plasma samples were assessed and showed differentiation between time points with no further separation among the three chocolate treatments. Multivariate statistics applied to urine samples could readily separate the postprandial time points and distinguish between the treatments. Most of the markers responsible for the multivariate discrimination between the chocolates were of dietary origin. Interestingly, small but significant level changes were also observed for a subset of endogenous metabolites. 1H NMR revealed that flavan-3-ol-enriched dark chocolate and standard dark chocolate reduced urinary levels of creatinine, lactate, some amino acids, and related degradation products and increased the levels of pyruvate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, a phenolic compound of bacterial origin. This study demonstrates that an acute chocolate intervention can significantly affect human metabolism.",

      "abstract": "An increase in the frequency of cardiovascular diseases has been observed in the HIV/AIDS population. Studies involving healthy subjects or subjects with other diseases have shown benefits of chocolate supplementation on endothelial function and vasodilation. We evaluate the impact of chocolate consumption on arterial elasticity in people living with human immunodeficiency virus - PLHIV. A double-blind, crossover trial including 110 PLHIV (19 to 59 years) on antiretroviral therapy - ART for at least 6 months and with a viral load of <500 copies per mL was conducted. All subjects were randomly assigned to 15-d dietary supplements containing dark chocolate or placebo with a 15-d washout period. Each participant received one of the two sequences: A (dark chocolate, placebo chocolate); B (placebo chocolate, dark chocolate). Arterial elasticity was measured using the HDI/PulseWave™ CR-2000 CardioVascular Profiling System®. Body composition, lipid profile, C-reactive protein, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were also assessed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures using the Stata 11.0® program was used for cross-over analysis. Most subjects were men (59.0%) and Caucasian (46.1%) and the mean age was 44.6 ± 7.1 years. The mean time since diagnosis of HIV infection was 13.7 ± 5.3 years and the mean duration of ART was 12.9 ± 4.2 years. Chocolate consumption resulted in significant alterations in the large artery elasticity index - LAEI (p = 0.049) and the mean concentration of HDL-c was higher after supplementation with dark chocolate (p = 0.045). This is the first study to evaluate the effect of chocolate on arterial elasticity in PLHIV. The results showed that dark chocolate consumption for 15 days improved the elastic properties of the LAEI in PLHIV. These findings, added to the noninvasive method used, may expand the knowledge of CVDs in this population.",

However, nothing is known about its effects on exercise capacity and underlying mechanisms in normal, sedentary subjects. Twenty normal, sedentary subjects (∼50 years old) were randomized to placebo or dark chocolate (DC) groups and consumed 20 g of the products for 3 months. Subjects underwent before and after treatment, bicycle ergometry to assess VO2 max and work, SkM biopsy to assess changes in mitochondrial density, function and oxidative stress and blood sampling to assess metabolic endpoints. Seventeen subjects completed the trial. In the DC group (n = 9), VO2 max increased (17% increase, p = 0.056) as well as maximum work (watts) achieved (p = 0.026) with no changes with placebo (n = 8). The DC group evidenced increases in HDL levels (p = 0.005) and decreased triglycerides (p = 0.07). With DC, SkM evidenced significant increases in protein levels for LKB1, AMPK and PGC1α and in their active forms (phosphorylated AMPK and LKB1) as well as in citrate synthase activity while no changes were observed in mitochondrial density. With DC, significant increases in SkM reduced glutathione levels and decreases in protein carbonylation were observed. Improvements in maximum work achieved and VO2 max may be due to DC activation of upstream control systems and enhancement of SkM mitochondria efficiency. Larger clinical studies are warranted to confirm these observations.",

      "abstract": "The use of cacao for health benefits dates back at least 3000 years. Our understanding of cacao has evolved with modern science. It is now felt based on extensive research the main health benefits of cacao stem from epicatechin, a flavanol found in cacao. The process of manufacturing dark chocolate retains epicatechin, whereas milk chocolate does not contain significant amounts of epicatechin. Thus, most of the current research studies are focused on dark chocolate. Both epidemiological and clinical studies suggest a beneficial effect of dark chocolate on blood pressure, lipids, and inflammation. Proposed mechanisms underlying these benefits include enhanced nitric oxide bioavailability and improved mitochondrial structure/function. Ultimately, further studies of this promising compound are needed to elucidate its potential for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases as well as other diseases that have underlying mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and nitric oxide deficiency."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that cocoa and cocoa-containing foods have the potential to lower blood pressure and improve endothelial function. Most of the studies reporting the beneficial effects of dark chocolate on blood pressure have been short (≤ 4 weeks). The aim of the present 8-wks (weeks) study was to assess the effects of regular consumption of dark chocolate during a reduced snack consumption intervention on blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in mildly hypertensive individuals. DESIGN: This was a randomized, controlled, cross-over trial involving 22 adults (8 women, 14 men), aged 33-64 y, BMI 27.7 ± 3.7 kg/m(2) with mild hypertension. During the intervention period (8-wks) the participants reduced the intake of habitual snacks and replaced them with dark chocolate (49 g/day). In the control period, they only reduced the snacks without any added chocolate. Data (blood lipid profile, glucose, insulin, 24 h blood pressure) was collected in the beginning and end of both periods (intervention and control), and some variables also in the run-in and run-out periods (weight, body fat percentage, blood pressure, arterial stiffness index, diet and physical activity). RESULTS: Daily consumption of dark chocolate had no effects on 24 h blood pressure, resting blood pressure (mean ± SD, pre 142 ± 11.5/89 ± 8.4 mmHg vs. post 142 ± 14.2/88 ± 9.4 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively) or arterial stiffness (mean ± SD, pre 7.68 ± 0.88 vs. post 7.76 ± 0.89). Weight was reduced by 1.0 ± 2.2 kg during the control (reduced snack only) period, but was unchanged while eating chocolate (p < 0.027 between the treatments). CONCLUSION: The data collected in this study indicates that inclusion of dark chocolate daily in the diet had no significant effects on blood pressure or other cardiovascular risk factors during a reduced snack period.

      "abstract": "Dark chocolate contains many biologically active components, such as catechins, procyanidins and theobromine from cocoa, together with added sucrose and lipids. All of these can directly or indirectly affect the cardiovascular system by multiple mechanisms. Intervention studies on healthy and metabolically-dysfunctional volunteers have suggested that cocoa improves blood pressure, platelet aggregation and endothelial function. The effect of chocolate is more convoluted since the sucrose and lipid may transiently and negatively impact on endothelial function, partly through insulin signalling and nitric oxide bioavailability. However, few studies have attempted to dissect out the role of the individual components and have not explored their possible interactions. For intervention studies, the situation is complex since suitable placebos are often not available, and some benefits may only be observed in individuals showing mild metabolic dysfunction. For chocolate, the effects of some of the components, such as sugar and epicatechin on FMD, may oppose each other, or alternatively in some cases may act together, such as theobromine and epicatechin. Although clearly cocoa provides some cardiovascular benefits according to many human intervention studies, the exact components, their interactions and molecular mechanisms are still under debate.",

      "abstract": "Twenty-nine healthy volunteers aged 47-69 years old were randomly assigned to a 28-day oral intake of different dark chocolate (DC) formulations. The main group received daily 30 g of proprietary lycopene-containing (L-tug) lycosome formulation of DC with enhanced bioavailability of cocoa flavanols. Two control groups daily consumed either 30 g of regular DC alone or along with 7 mg of lycopene, which corresponds to the amount of lycopene ingested with L-tug formulation. It was found that L-tug was more efficient in reducing diastolic blood pressure (mean value of -6.22 mmHg, 95% CI: 5.00, 8.00) when compared with the regular DC group (-3.00 mmHg, P < 0.05) or the group which ingested the DC and lycopene as two separate formulations (mean reduction of -4 mmHg, 95% CI: 2.47, 6.00, P = 0.0262). Only marginal superiority for L-tug formulation in the reduction in systolic blood pressure was seen. However, the L-tug formulation was the only formulation of DC which affected serum lipids. There was a reduction in total cholesterol (from median 228.00 mg/dL [95% CI: 206.2, 242.5] to 187.00 mg/dL [95% CI: 166.2, 202.2, P < 0.05]) with corresponding decline of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (from a median of 166.00 mg/dL [95% CI: 130.8, 177.0] to 151.00 mg/dL [95% CI: 122.8, 167.4; P < 0.05]) at the end of the intervention period. Similar decline was seen in serum triglycerides (P < 0.05). Serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, glucose levels, and C-reactive protein (CRP) values remained statistically unchanged in all study groups throughout the intervention period. A superior biological activity of the L-tug lycosome formulation of DC extending beyond its antihypertensive effect to lipid-lowering ability opens up new possibilities for the use of DC for health purposes helping to reduce daily caloric intake without compromising on the health benefits of DC consumption."

A randomized and controlled trial was carried out involving 60 healthy volunteers, randomized into two groups: control group (CG; n = 30) and intervention group (IG; n = 30). The IG ingested a daily dosage of 10 g of dark chocolate (>75% cocoa) for a month. Blood pressure (BP), flow-mediated dilation (FMD), arterial stiffness index (ASI), aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), and pulse wave analysis (PWA) were assessed at baseline and one week after the one-month intervention period. Results. Arterial function improved after intervention in the IG, with PWV decreasing from 6.13 ± 0.41 m/s to 5.83 ± 0.53 m/s (P = 0.02), with no significant differences observed in the CG. A significant decrease in ASI (0.16 ± 0.01 to 0.13 ± 0.01; P < 0.001) and AiX (-15.88 ± 10.75 to -22.57 ± 11.16; P = 0.07) was also depicted for the IG. Endothelial function improved in the IG, with the FMD increasing 9.31% after the 1-month intervention (P < 0.001), with no significant variation in the CG. Conclusion. The daily ingestion of 10 g dark chocolate (>75% cocoa) during a month significantly improves vascular function in young and healthy individuals."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A prebiotic such as inulin is a well-known functional plant food ingredient. It is capable of stimulating growth of beneficial bifidobacteria in the intestine thus protecting against intestinal infections, preventing constipation, increasing mineral absorption, reducing the incidence of colon cancer, and producing B vitamins. Inulin added to food therefore has to be stable during food processing especially against heat treatment, low pH and Maillard reaction. METHODS: Newly developed dark chocolate, DC-1, containing inulin (replacing sugar component) as an added value, was stored at 18 degrees C, 60% relative humidity and 25 degrees C, 80% relative humidity (RH) to determine shelf life stability compared to control dark chocolate, DC-0 (with high content of sugar). Sensory evaluation (quantitative descriptive analysis), water activity (a(w)), microbiological content and presence of inulin after storage of the prebiotic chocolate under both conditions were evaluated to determine shelf life. RESULTS: The DC-1 chocolate had at least 12 months of shelf life at 18 degrees C, 60% RH with better acceptance than DC-0; moreover, it did not experience microbiological and inulin content changes. At 25 degrees C, 80% RH, the growth of Aspergillus sp. was observed on the surface of both DC-0 and DC-1 with a(w) > 0.50 after a 2-month storage. CONCLUSION: Shelf life stability of DC-1 is almost similar to DC-0.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of cocoa and dark chocolate is associated with a lower risk of CVD, and improvements in endothelial function may mediate this relationship. Less is known about the effects of cocoa/chocolate on the augmentation index (AI), a measure of vascular stiffness and vascular tone in the peripheral arterioles. We enrolled thirty middle-aged, overweight adults in a randomised, placebo-controlled, 4-week, cross-over study. During the active treatment (cocoa) period, the participants consumed 37 g/d of dark chocolate and a sugar-free cocoa beverage (total cocoa = 22 g/d, total flavanols (TF) = 814 mg/d). Colour-matched controls included a low-flavanol chocolate bar and a cocoa-free beverage with no added sugar (TF = 3 mg/d). Treatments were matched for total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates and protein. The cocoa treatment significantly increased the basal diameter and peak diameter of the brachial artery by 6% (+2 mm) and basal blood flow volume by 22%. Substantial decreases in the AI, a measure of arterial stiffness, were observed in only women. Flow-mediated dilation and the reactive hyperaemia index remained unchanged. The consumption of cocoa had no effect on fasting blood measures, while the control treatment increased fasting insulin concentration and insulin resistance (P= 0·01). Fasting blood pressure (BP) remained unchanged, although the acute consumption of cocoa increased resting BP by 4 mmHg. In summary, the high-flavanol cocoa and dark chocolate treatment was associated with enhanced vasodilation in both conduit and resistance arteries and was accompanied by significant reductions in arterial stiffness in women.",

Recent evidence suggests that high-polyphenol dark chocolate improves endothelial function and lowers blood pressure. This study aimed to evaluate the association of chocolate 70% cocoa intake with metabolic profile, oxidative stress, inflammation, blood pressure, and endothelial function in stage 1 hypertensives with excess body weight. Methods. Intervention clinical trial includes 22 stage 1 hypertensives without previous antihypertensive treatment, aged 18 to 60 years and presents a body mass index between 25.0 and 34.9 kg/m(2). All participants were instructed to consume 50 g of chocolate 70% cocoa/day (2135 mg polyphenols) for 4 weeks. Endothelial function was evaluated by peripheral artery tonometry using Endo-PAT 2000 (Itamar Medical). Results. Twenty participants (10 men) completed the study. Comparison of pre-post intervention revealed that (1) there were no significant changes in anthropometric parameters, percentage body fat, glucose metabolism, lipid profile, biomarkers of inflammation, adhesion molecules, oxidized LDL, and blood pressure; (2) the assessment of endothelial function through the reactive hyperemia index showed a significant increase: 1.94 ± 0.18 to 2.22 ± 0.08, P = 0.01.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 42 healthy subjects received an acute dose of flavan-3-ol-enriched dark, standard dark or white chocolate, in random order. Blood and urine samples were obtained just before and 2 and 6 h after consumption for measurements of platelet function, and bioavailability and excretion of flavan-3-ols. Flavan-3-ol-enriched dark chocolate significantly decreased adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and P-selectin expression in men (all p ≤ 0.020), decreased thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation and increased thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced fibrinogen binding in women (both p ≤ 0.041), and increased collagen/epinephrine-induced ex vivo bleeding time in men and women (p ≤ 0.042). White chocolate significantly decreased adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet P-selectin expression (p = 0.002) and increased collagen/epinephrine-induced ex vivo bleeding time (p = 0.042) in men only. Differences in efficacy by which flavan-3-ols affect platelet function were only partially explained by concentrations of flavan-3-ols and their metabolites in plasma or urine. CONCLUSION: Flavan-3-ols in dark chocolate, but also compounds in white chocolate, can improve platelet function, dependent on gender, and may thus beneficially affect atherogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Nitric oxide plays a pivotal role in regulating vascular tone. Different studies show endothelial function is impaired during hyperglycemia. Dark chocolate increases flow-mediated dilation in healthy and hypertensive subjects with and without glucose intolerance; however, the effect of pretreatment with dark chocolate on endothelial function and other vascular responses to hyperglycemia has not been examined. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of flavanol-rich dark chocolate administration on (1) flow-mediated dilation and wave reflections; (2) blood pressure, endothelin-1 and oxidative stress, before and after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Twelve healthy volunteers (5 males, 28.2±2.7 years) randomly received either 100 g/d dark chocolate or flavanol-free white chocolate for 3 days. After 7 days washout period, volunteers were switched to the other treatment. Flow-mediated dilation, stiffness index, reflection index, peak-to-peak time, blood pressure, endothelin-1 and 8-iso-PGF(2α) were evaluated after each treatment phase and OGTT. Compared with white chocolate, dark chocolate ingestion improved flow-mediated dilation (P=0.03), wave reflections, endothelin-1 and 8-iso-PGF(2α) (P<0.05). After white chocolate ingestion, flow-mediated dilation was reduced after OGTT from 7.88±0.68 to 6.07±0.76 (P=0.027), 6.74±0.51 (P=0.046) at 1 and 2 h after the glucose load, respectively. Similarly, after white chocolate but not after dark chocolate, wave reflections, blood pressure, and endothelin-1 and 8-iso-PGF(2α) increased after OGTT. OGTT causes acute, transient impairment of endothelial function and oxidative stress, which is attenuated by flavanol-rich dark chocolate. These results suggest cocoa flavanols may contribute to vascular health by reducing the postprandial impairment of arterial function associated with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed at testing the hypothesis that dark chocolate, which holds potent antioxidant properties, might attenuate the postprandial increase in HVPG in patients with cirrhosis. DESIGN: In this phase 2, double-blind, controlled study, 22 cirrhotic patients referred for HVPG measurement were included and randomly assigned to receive a liquid meal containing either dark chocolate (active treatment; 85% cocoa, 0.55 g/kg body wt; n = 11) or isocaloric amounts of white chocolate (devoid of cocoa flavonoids; control subjects; n = 11). HVPG, arterial pressure, portal blood flow, serum flavonoids (catechin and epicatechin), and nitric oxide were measured at baseline and 30 min after meal administration. The main outcome measure was the change in HVPG 30 min after the test meal. RESULTS: Postprandial hyperemia was accompanied by a marked increase in HVPG in the white-chocolate group (16.0 ± 4.7-19.7 ± 4.1 mm Hg or +26.4 ± 12.7%; P < 0.0001), whereas the postprandial increase in HVPG was markedly attenuated in the dark-chocolate group (16.9 ± 2.9-18.7 ± 3.5 mm Hg or +11.5 ± 15.9%; P = 0.02 compared with white chocolate). Portal blood flow increased similarly after meals containing dark or white chocolate (median increase: 32% compared with 39%). Plasma flavonoids increased 15-50-fold after dark chocolate consumption. Dark but not white chocolate induced a mild increase in arterial pressure (+8.8 ± 8.8% compared with -0.3 ± 4.9%; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: In patients with cirrhosis, dark chocolate blunted the postprandial increase in HVPG by improving flow-mediated hepatic vasorelaxation and ameliorated systemic hypotension.

DESIGN: Best case scenario analysis using a Markov model. SETTING: Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study. PARTICIPANTS: 2013 people with hypertension who met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, with no history of cardiovascular disease and not receiving antihypertensive therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment effects associated with dark chocolate consumption derived from published meta-analyses were used to determine the absolute number of cardiovascular events with and without treatment. Costs associated with cardiovascular events and treatments were applied to determine the potential amount of funding required for dark chocolate therapy to be considered cost effective. RESULTS: Daily consumption of dark chocolate (polyphenol content equivalent to 100 g of dark chocolate) can reduce cardiovascular events by 85 (95% confidence interval 60 to 105) per 10,000 population treated over 10 years. $A40 (£25; €31; $42) could be cost effectively spent per person per year on prevention strategies using dark chocolate. These results assume 100% compliance and represent a best case scenario. CONCLUSIONS: The blood pressure and cholesterol lowering effects of dark chocolate consumption are beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular events in a population with metabolic syndrome. Daily dark chocolate consumption could be an effective cardiovascular preventive strategy in this population.",

METHODS: the study was a parallel randomized clinical trial. A total of thirty-two subjects was divided into two groups using block randomization. Sixteen subjects received 30 g/day dark chocolate and dietary counseling (treatment group) and the other 16 subjects received white chocolate 25 g/day and dietary counseling (control group) for fifteen days. Data collected in this study consisted of age, physical activity, body massa index, intake of energy, intake of sodium, and intake of polyphenol, NO serum levels and blood pressure. The measurement of NO serum levels was done in pre- and after- treatment, while blood pressure was assessed in pre- , during- and after- treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-test for normal distribution data and Mann-Whitney test for not normal distribution data, with the level of significancy of 5%. RESULTS: after 15 days treatment, NO serum level between treatment and control groups were significantly different 7.70 ± 3.84 vs 1.92(-0.79 ± 17.78) (p=0.001). Both groups had decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure was different significantly between groups after treatment 120.64 ± 8.47 vs 131.19 ± 7.45 (p=0.001), while diastolic blood pressure was not significant 74.14 ± 6.30 vs 77.44 ± 10.29 (p=0.308). CONCLUSION: in prehypertension subjects, dark chocolate 30 g/day increased NOx serum levels and decreased systolic blood pressure after 15 days of treatment.",

      "abstract": "Cocoa products, which are rich sources of flavonoids, have been shown to reduce blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Dark chocolate contains saturated fat and is a source of dietary calories; consequently, it is important to determine whether consumption of dark chocolate adversely affects the blood lipid profile. The objective was to examine the effects of dark chocolate/cocoa product consumption on the lipid profile using published trials. A detailed literature search was conducted via MEDLINE (from 1966 to May 2010), CENTRAL and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled clinical trials assessing the effects of flavanol-rich cocoa products or dark chocolate on lipid profile. The primary effect measure was the difference in means of the final measurements between the intervention and control groups. In all, 10 clinical trials consisting of 320 participants were included in the analysis. Treatment duration ranged from 2 to 12 weeks. Intervention with dark chocolate/cocoa products significantly reduced serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol (TC) levels (differences in means (95% CI) were -5.90 mg/dl (-10.47, -1.32 mg/dl) and -6.23 mg/dl (-11.60, -0.85 mg/dl), respectively). No statistically significant effects were observed for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (difference in means (95% CI): -0.76 mg/dl (-3.02 to 1.51 mg/dl)) and triglyceride (TG) (-5.06 mg/dl (-13.45 to 3.32 mg/dl)). These data are consistent with beneficial effects of dark chocolate/cocoa products on total and LDL cholesterol and no major effects on HDL and TG in short-term intervention trials.",

Twenty active men cycled at 60% maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) for 1.5 hr, with the intensity increased to 90% VO2max for a 30-s period every 10 min, followed by a ride to exhaustion at 90% VO2max. In the 2 wk before exercise participants consumed 40 g of DC or an isocarbohydrate-fat control cocoa liquor-free chocolate (CON) twice daily and once 2 hr before exercise in a randomized, counterbalanced, crossover design. Venous blood samples were taken immediately before exercise, postexercise (fixed duration), postexhaustion, and after 1 hr of recovery. F2-isoprostanes were significantly lower (post hoc tests: p < .001) at exhaustion and after 1 hr of recovery with DC. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins were significantly lower with DC (p < .001) both before and after exercise and at exhaustion. DC was also associated with ~21% greater rises in free fatty acids during exercise (main effect: p < .05). Changes in circulating glucose, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra were unaffected by treatment. Time to exhaustion at 90% VO2max was not significantly different between trials (398 ± 204 and 374 ± 194 s for DC and CON, respectively). These results suggest that regular DC intake is associated with reduced oxidative-stress markers and increased mobilization of free fatty acids after exercise but has no observed effect on exercise performance.",

Mexico City (MC) residents are chronically exposed to high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and PM-associated lipopolysaccharides (PM-LPS). To test the hypothesis that chronic exposure to urban pollution produces myocardial inflammation, female Balb-c mice age 4 weeks were exposed for 16 months to two distinctly different polluted areas within MC: southwest (SW) and northwest (NW). SW mice were given either no treatment or chocolate 2g/9.5 mg polyphenols/3 times per week. Results were compared to mice kept in clean air. Key inflammatory mediator genes: cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and the LPS receptor CD14 (cluster of differentiation antigen 14) were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Also explored were target NFκB (nuclear factor κB), oxidative stress and antioxidant defense genes. TNF-α, IL-6, and COX-2 were significantly increased in both NW and SWMC mice (p=0.0001). CD14 was up-regulated in SW mice in keeping with the high exposures to particulate matter associated endotoxin. Chocolate administration resulted in a significant down-regulation of TNF-α (p<0.0001), IL-6 (p=0.01), and IL-1β (p=0.02). The up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes and the down-regulation of potent oxidases, toll-like receptors, and pro-apoptotic signaling genes completed the protective profile. Exposure to air pollution produces up-regulation of inflammatory myocardial genes and endotoxin plays a key role in the inflammatory response. Regular consumption of dark chocolate may reduce myocardial inflammation and have cardioprotective properties in the setting of air pollution exposures.",

In addition, because of secrecy surrounding the production of chocolate and the unique sociocultural context of this popular food, research on efficacy and effectiveness is complex.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Flavanol-rich chocolate and lycopene-rich tomato extract have attracted interest as potential alternative treatment options for hypertension, a known risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Treatment of prehypertension (SBP 120-139/DBP 80-89 mmHg) may forestall progression to hypertension. However, there has been only limited research into non-pharmacological treatment options for prehypertension. We investigated the effect of dark chocolate or tomato extract on blood pressure, and their acceptability as an ongoing treatment option in a prehypertensive population. METHODS: Our trial consisted of two phases: a randomised controlled three-group-parallel trial over 12 weeks (phase 1) followed by a crossover of the two active treatment arms over an additional 12-week period (phase 2). Group 1 received a 50 g daily dose of dark chocolate with 70% cocoa containing 750 mg polyphenols, group 2 were allocated one tomato extract capsule containing 15 mg lycopene per day, and group 3 received one placebo capsule daily over 8 weeks followed by a 4-week washout period. In phase 2 the active treatment groups were crossed over to receive the alternative treatment. Median blood pressure, weight, and abdominal circumference were measured 4-weekly, and other characteristics including physical activity, general health, energy, mood, and acceptability of treatment were assessed by questionnaire at 0, 8 and 20 weeks. We analysed changes over time using a linear mixed model, and one time point differences using Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher's-Exact, or t-tests. RESULTS: Thirty-six prehypertensive healthy adult volunteers completed the 6-month trial. Blood pressure changes over time within groups and between groups were not significant and independent of treatment. Weight and other characteristics did not change significantly during the trial. However, a marked difference in acceptability between the two treatment forms (chocolate or capsule) was revealed (p < 0.0001). Half of the participants allocated to the chocolate treatment found it hard to eat 50 g of dark chocolate every day and 20% considered it an unacceptable long-term treatment option, whereas all participants found it easy and acceptable to take a capsule each day for blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Our study did not find a blood pressure lowering effect of dark chocolate or tomato extract in a prehypertensive population. Practicability of chocolate as a long-term treatment option may be limited. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12609000047291.",

Accumulating evidence from the past 10 years demonstrates that moderate consumption of chocolate, especially dark chocolate, may exert protective effects against the development of cardiovascular disease. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this positive influence, including metabolic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic effects, as well as effects on insulin sensitivity and vascular endothelial function. Should these results be confirmed in randomised, controlled, cross-over, multi-dose trials, then the pleasure associated with chocolate consumption might also be justified from health and psychological perspectives. However, since dark chocolate has substantially higher levels of flavonoids than milk chocolate, and milk proteins may inhibit absorption of flavonoids, it might be preferable to consume dark chocolate than the white (milk) variety.",

      "abstract": "Flavanols from chocolate appear to increase nitric oxide bioavailability, protect vascular endothelium, and decrease cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. We sought to test the effect of flavanol-rich dark chocolate (FRDC) on endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). After a run-in phase, 19 hypertensives with IGT (11 males, 8 females; 44.8 +/- 8.0 y) were randomized to receive isocalorically either FRDC or flavanol-free white chocolate (FFWC) at 100 g/d for 15 d. After a wash-out period, patients were switched to the other treatment. Clinical and 24-h ambulatory BP was determined by sphygmometry and oscillometry, respectively, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), oral glucose tolerance test, serum cholesterol and C-reactive protein, and plasma homocysteine were evaluated after each treatment phase. FRDC but not FFWC ingestion decreased insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; P < 0.0001) and increased insulin sensitivity (quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, insulin sensitivity index (ISI), ISI(0); P < 0.05) and beta-cell function (corrected insulin response CIR(120); P = 0.035). Systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP decreased (P < 0.0001) after FRDC (SBP, -3.82 +/- 2.40 mm Hg; DBP, -3.92 +/- 1.98 mm Hg; 24-h SBP, -4.52 +/- 3.94 mm Hg; 24-h DBP, -4.17 +/- 3.29 mm Hg) but not after FFWC. Further, FRDC increased FMD (P < 0.0001) and decreased total cholesterol (-6.5%; P < 0.0001), and LDL cholesterol (-7.5%; P < 0.0001). Changes in insulin sensitivity (Delta ISI - Delta FMD: r = 0.510, P = 0.001; Delta QUICKI - Delta FMD: r = 0.502, P = 0.001) and beta-cell function (Delta CIR(120) - Delta FMD: r = 0.400, P = 0.012) were directly correlated with increases in FMD and inversely correlated with decreases in BP (Delta ISI - Delta 24-h SBP: r = -0.368, P = 0.022; Delta ISI - Delta 24-h DBP r = -0.384, P = 0.017). Thus, FRDC ameliorated insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function, decreased BP, and increased FMD in IGT hypertensive patients. These findings suggest flavanol-rich, low-energy cocoa food products may have a positive impact on CVD risk factors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been increased interest in the potential health-related benefits of antioxidant- and phytochemical-rich dark chocolate and cocoa. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the short-term (6 wk) effects of dark chocolate and cocoa on variables associated with neuropsychological functioning and cardiovascular health in healthy older adults. DESIGN: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel-group clinical trial was used. Participants (n = 101) were randomly assigned to receive a 37-g dark chocolate bar and 8 ounces (237 mL) of an artificially sweetened cocoa beverage or similar placebo products each day for 6 wk. RESULTS: No significant group (dark chocolate and cocoa or placebo)-by-trial (baseline, midpoint, and end-of-treatment assessments) interactions were found for the neuropsychological, hematological, or blood pressure variables examined. In contrast, the midpoint and end-of-treatment mean pulse rate assessments in the dark chocolate and cocoa group were significantly higher than those at baseline and significantly higher than the midpoint and end-of-treatment rates in the control group. Results of a follow-up questionnaire item on the treatment products that participants believed they had consumed during the trial showed that more than half of the participants in both groups correctly identified the products that they had ingested during the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation failed to support the predicted beneficial effects of short-term dark chocolate and cocoa consumption on any of the neuropsychological or cardiovascular health-related variables included in this research. Consumption of dark chocolate and cocoa was, however, associated with significantly higher pulse rates at 3- and 6-wk treatment assessments.",
