      "abstract": "Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder syndrome caused by a disorder of purine metabolism in the body, followed by urate crystal deposition leading to gouty arthritis, urate nephropathy, and kidney stones, collectively known as gout. Promoting uric acid stone dissolution by continuously reducing blood uric acid levels and reducing acute gout attacks in patients by controlling inflammatory pain reactions are identified as a potential therapy for gout. Starting from the natural product piperine, three analogs of novel piperine derivates were designed and synthesized to improve the anti-inflammation pain efficacy. Among this, compound 39 exhibited remarkable analgesic and urate-lowering effect in formalin-induced inflammatory pain model and hyperuricemic model, respectively. Besides, compound 39 exhibited a relatively potent TRPV1 antagonistic effect with an IC50 = 33.06 ± 3.15 nM, and moderate to weak URAT1 (IC50 = 22.51 ± 5.62 μM) and GLUT9 inhibitory activities (60.25 % at 50 μM). Further experiment showed that 39 exhibited high stability in vitro and in vivo, and its oral bioavailability was 34 %, with a more than 8 h T1/2. Notably, compound 39 showed high selectivity over other ion channel including hERG which indicated a high safety index. Furthermore, no significant acute damage was observed at the liver microsome, cellular and animal levels. In the long-term administration experiment of hyperuricemia model mice, it was confirmed that 39 could reverse the tissue damage and inflammation caused by high uric acid. Overall, these findings identified a promising candidate to target the pathogenesis of gout by simultaneously suppressing pian and the reabsorption of uric acid."

Therefore, new agents are still needed for breast cancer treatment. This research aimed to investigate anticancer activity and mechanisms of a piperine derivative, named (2E,4E)-5-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)penta-2,4-dienamide (1f), against MCF-7 breast cancer cell. The results show that 1f ranging from 7.5 to 60 μg/mL inhibited MCF-7 cells in dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 17.02 ± 1.74 μg/mL. It inhibited cell migration in dose and time dependent manners. In addition, it induced morphological characteristics of apoptosis and increased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure staining and DNA fragmentation confirmed the induction of apoptosis. 1f induced the gene expression of TP53, PTEN, and CASP9, while ESR1, BRCA1, BRCA2, PIK3CA, AKT1 CHEK2, BRIP1 and KRAS expression were decreased. STRING protein-protein interaction network and KEGG pathway analysis predicted the induction of apoptosis linked with DNA repair, estrogen receptor-α (ER-α), and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results shows that 1f reduced the lipid utilization rate and inhibited protein synthesis, resulting in the induction of apoptosis. Overall, 1f is an interesting candidate for development as an anticancer agent for breast cancer."

      "abstract": "Piperine, an active compound found in black pepper, exhibits promising anti-cancer properties by targeting critical signaling pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This review explores the diverse mechanisms through which piperine exerts its effects, including inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways, activation of p38 and JNK pathways, and suppression of NF-kB/AP-1 signaling. Piperine disrupts Wnt/β-catenin signaling by inhibiting β-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF binding, thereby impairing cancer cell growth and metastasis. Additionally, piperine demonstrates anti-inflammatory actions by reducing CXCL8 expression and modulating the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways. To overcome the issues of low solubility and bioavailability, several nanoformulations of piperinewere developed, such as polymer nanoparticles, nanoemulsion, liposomes, micelles, metal-organic frameworks and inorganic carriers, establishing promising cytotoxicity, prolonged-release, enhanced cellular influx, and directed drug delivery. The mechanisms involve G₀ and G₂/M arrest of the cell cycle, mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (involving Bax/Bcl-2 modulation and caspase activation), and cancer celldeath. In vivo studies underscore the efficacy of piperine, while synergistic effects with other natural products and chemotherapy highlight its potential as a versatile therapeutic agent as an anticancer agent. These findings underscore piperine's potential as a multifaceted therapeutic agent for cancer treatment, emphasizing its diverse mechanisms of action and promising role in oncology."

This study investigates the role of cocrystal technology in overcoming these limitations through the formation of curcumin-piperine (CUR-PIP) cocrystals (CoCry). The CUR-PIP CoCry was evaluated for its ability to suppress IGF2 over expression in UBC. Molecular interactions were predicted via Auto Dock simulations, and the co crystals were characterized using FTIR, DSC, PXRD, SEM, and ssNMR. Saturation solubility, dissolution, permeability, and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. The therapeutic efficacy of CUR-PIP CoCry was tested in a bladder cancer rat model induced by N-Methyl Nitrosourea; with IGF2 expression quantified using qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. The CUR-PIP CoCry demonstrated enhanced drug release and permeability compared to CUR alone. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a 5.7-fold increase in Cmax and a 7.9-fold increase in AUC0-12 hr compared to CUR alone. In vivo studies using an MNU-induced bladder cancer rat model demonstrated that CUR-PIP CoCry significantly suppressed IGF2 expression (p < 0.001) and enhanced anticancer efficacy. This study underscores the potential of cocrystallization as a novel approach to enhance bioavailability and therapeutic effectiveness in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer; however, its function is often compromised due to MDM2 overexpression or mutations in the p53 gene, which occurs in approximately 30-35 % of breast cancer cases. Piperine, a natural bioactive compound, has shown potential in inhibiting breast cancer cell growth by upregulating p53 expression. However, its clinical application is hindered by poor bioavailability, potential toxicity, and the risk of undesirable drug interactions. In the present study, a novel derivative of Piperine, YL-1-9, was synthesized and evaluated for its anticancer activity against breast cancer. YL-1-9, a bicyclic amide derivative of Piperine, was evaluated for antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo using MTT assays and the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Further investigations into its effects on breast cancer cell clonogenicity, adhesion, invasion, and migration were conducted through colony formation assays, EdU assays, cell adhesion and invasion studies, and wound healing experiments. Western blot analysis was performed to elucidate the effects of YL-1-9 on the cell cycle and apoptosis, which were further validated using YO-PRO-1 and propidium iodide dual staining. YL-1-9 significantly inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion, and migration, while inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. Mechanistically, YL-1-9 downregulated critical proteins in the CDK4/6-cyclin D-Rb-E2F pathway and the Caspase 3/Bax/Bcl-2 apoptosis signaling pathway. These findings position YL-1-9 as a promising candidate for breast cancer therapy; however, further clinical studies are necessary to fully assess its therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Piperine has been investigated for a diverse array of biological effects, including a potential role in modulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. This study conducted a comprehensive co-crystallographic analysis of the complex of piperine with the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (PPARγ-LBD), with the objective of elucidating the precise binding interactions of piperine. The co-crystal structure revealed that piperine binds within the ligand-binding pocket of PPARγ-LBD via hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with residues of the ligand-binding site. Notably, in contrast to conventional full agonists, piperine does not directly stabilize helix H12. This could contribute to the comparatively weaker agonistic activity of piperine. The results of this study also suggest that piperine binding facilitates a role as a partial agonist or even an antagonist under certain physiological conditions. Collectively, these findings contribute to a greater understanding of the manner in which piperine modulates PPARγ function and its potential as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Given its natural origin and relatively minimal side-effect profile, piperine and its derivatives could be promising alternatives to synthetic PPARγ modulators such as thiazolidinediones, which have significant side effects.",

      "abstract": "Piperine, a natural alkaloid found in black pepper (Piper nigrum), has the chemical formula C₁₇H₁₉NO₃ and a molecular weight of 285.34 g/mol. This research investigated its effect on the mTOR protein, which plays a crucial role in cancer development, using molecular docking, dynamic simulations, MTT, and scratch wound assays on the HCT-116 colon cancer cell line. Molecular docking revealed that piperine exhibited a binding affinity of - 8.3 kcal/mol to the mTOR protein, which is significantly comparable to rapamycin's binding affinity of - 8.8 kcal/mol, a well-known mTOR inhibitor. This comparison highlights that piperine demonstrates a substantial ability to interact with the mTOR binding site, making it a potential candidate for further evaluation. Molecular dynamics simulation studies over 100 ns confirmed that piperine remains stable and firmly bound to the mTOR active site, binding in an ATP-competitive mode. MTT assay results revealed that piperine significantly reduced cancer cell viability, with IC50 values of 84.5 ± 0.5 µM at 24 h, 46.3 ± 0.26 µM at 48 h, and 19.73 ± 0.25 µM at 72 h, while the scratch wound assay confirmed its inhibition of cancer cell migration, suggesting potential to suppress metastasis. These findings indicate that piperine is a promising mTOR inhibitor with potential applications in cancer therapy, though further research is needed."

Clarithromycin represents the cornerstone of regimens for fast-growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria, due to its antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. Coadministration with an adjuvant compound could decrease the minimum inhibitory concentration of antimicrobials in cases of resistant bacilli. Our focus was to combine clarithromycin with piperine, a natural compound with several biological activities already described. We determined the in vitro extra- and intracellular activity of clarithromycin, piperine and the combination against clinical isolates of fast-growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Piperine was shown to modulate the activity of the antimicrobial in vitro by up to 16 times at the extracellular level, including against clinical isolates phenotypically resistant to clarithromycin. The bacteriostatic activity of clarithromycin was prolonged when combined with piperine for 96 h in the time-kill curve assay. Furthermore, in an intramacrophage environment, there was a modest improvement in the activity of the combination which could be explained by the fact that the action of piperine facilitates the entry of the antimicrobial into macrophages. This leads us to believe that the use of piperine as a possible candidate for adjuvant therapy with clarithromycin for the treatment of mycobacteriosis caused by fast-growing species could prevent the appearance of resistant isolates and thus increase the chances of curing these patients.",

Simultaneously deactivating both proteins can initiate lipid peroxidation, leading to ferroptosis and subsequent cell death. In this study, we developed a transferrin-modified liposomes (TDPL) doped with unsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as a lipid peroxidation inducer and encapsulated piperine (PIP) to realize effective anticancer therapy. Specifically, transferrin serves a dual role in this system, acting as both a ligand targeting transferrin receptors and a Fe3+ ionophore. Triggered by the low pH in the lysosome, Fe3+ ions bound to transferrin are released and reduce to Fe2+, which can subsequently catalyze the peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acid. Meanwhile, DHA incorporated into the lipid bilayer of the liposome, can fuse with the cell membrane and deactivate GPX4 and thus inducing lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, PIP functions as a potent DHODH inhibitor. Such combination prevents the detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides by GPX4 and the suppression of lipid peroxyl radical production by DHODH. Collectively, this straightforward system promotes antitumor efficacy of unsaturated fatty acid DHA and drug molecule PIP by inhibiting ferroptosis protection mechanisms to induce lipid peroxidation."

Characterized by irreversible pulmonary fibrosis, the disease's complex pathogenesis remains poorly elucidated, presenting significant challenges for therapeutic intervention. This study integrates bioinformatics, network pharmacology, and experimental validation to explore the potential mechanisms and therapeutic drugs for silicosis. Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in silicosis were subjected to GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Subsequently, the DEGs were imported into the cMap database for drug prediction, leading to the identification of piperine (PIP) as a candidate drug for the treatment of silicosis. Network pharmacology analysis then determined the pharmacological targets of PIP and demonstrated its ability to modulate the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Finally, we validated the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of PIP in silicosis. In vivo, PIP significantly ameliorated inflammation and fibrosis induced by crystalline silica (CS) in a murine model of silicosis, including inflammatory cell infiltration, formation of inflammasomes, deposition of collagen fibers and extracellular matrix, and expression of inflammatory and fibrotic factors. In vitro, PIP inhibited CS-induced cytokine expression, ROS generation, macrophage apoptosis, and activation of the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathways. Collectively, our research identifies and validates PIP as a promising candidate for the improvement of silicosis.",

      "abstract": "Vitiligo is a common skin disorder involving depigmentation. A 308-nm excimer laser and piperine were shown to be useful for the treatment of vitiligo. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 308-nm excimer laser combined with piperine in the treatment of vitiligo and the molecular mechanism by which this treatment promotes melanin synthesis through regulation of the paracrine activity of keratinocytes (KCs). In this study, cells and animals were treated with a 308-nm excimer laser and piperine. ELISA, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and RT‒qPCR were used to measure the levels of proteins and genes, and EdU, Transwell, and flow cytometric assays were used to assess cell proliferation and apoptosis. Treatment with the 308-nm excimer laser combined with piperine promoted KCs secretion of cytokines related to melanin production, restrained the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, elevated the level of PTEN, decreased the level of PDK1, inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, and facilitated the phosphorylation of GSK3b. After coculture of melanocytes (MCs) with KCs supernatant, the proliferation and migration of MCs increased, the apoptosis of MCs decreased, and the expression of melanin synthesis-related genes increased. Moreover, compared with the 308-nm excimer laser or piperine alone, the combined treatment had a more significant effect. Moreover, inhibiting PTEN weakened the effect of the combined treatment. Animal experiments revealed that a 308-nm excimer laser combined with piperine had a therapeutic effect on vitiligo. After combined treatment, the number of CD8 + T cells decreased, and the PTEN/PDK1/GSK3b pathway was activated, which increased melanin synthesis and alleviated the progression of vitiligo. In conclusion, a 308-nm excimer laser combined with piperine regulates KCs paracrine activity through the PTEN/PDK1/GSK3b molecular axis, promotes MCs proliferation and melanin synthesis, and alleviates the progression of vitiligo, which provides new targets for the clinical treatment of vitiligo.",

The RA rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10): The RA rats were treated with phosphate-buffered saline, RA rats treated with piperine (100 mg kg-1 orally), RA rats treated with prednisolone (10.00 mg kg-1 orally), and RA rats treated with a combination of piperine and prednisolone (half doses of each orally). Treatment started on day five post-induction when all rats had a clinical score of ≥ 1. Disease symptoms were monitored every other day until day 23 post-induction. Combining the two medications at half doses led to a more significant reduction in disease severity, weight improvement, and histopathological changes compared to using each drug alone at the full doses. The combined treatment group exhibited the most favorable response in C-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase, and nitric oxide biochemical tests compared to the other treatment groups. The combined treatment group showed decreased expression of T-bet and RORɣt genes. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the expression of Foxp3 and GATA3 genes compared to the group receiving prednisolone alone. Overall, combining piperine with prednisolone may prove to be a beneficial approach for managing RA."

      "abstract": "Tamoxifen (TMF) is an anticancer agent used for managing estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It has limited therapeutic efficacy against breast cancer, which could be enhanced by the coadministration of herbal drugs like piperine (PIP). However, the hydrophobic nature of TMF and PIP restricts their therapeutic application. Therefore, the present study focuses on the impact of the anticancer activity of TMF in combination with PIP and after entrapping them into liposomes (TMF-PIP-LPs and TMF-PIP-PEG-LPs). The liposomes were prepared using the thin film hydration method. In addition, the morphology of the prepared liposomes was found spherical after SEM and TEM analyses. Further, the in vitro cytotoxicity (IC50) study of pure PIP and TMF was found to be 90.3 ± 10.2 μg/mL and 40.9 ± 5.9 μg/mL, respectively. Interestingly, an improved cytotoxicity (IC50) was observed when the TMF and PIP were loaded into liposomes (TMF-PIP-LPs: 21 ± 1.6 μg/mL and TMF-PIP-PEG-LPs: 10 ± 0.5 μg/mL). Also, the PEGylated liposomes showed improvement in cellular uptake as compared to liposomes without PEGylation in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells. Thus, the enhanced cellular uptake and improved cytotoxicity of PEGylated liposomes can be a suitable strategy for delivering TMF with PIP for breast cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-resistant pathogens and industrial dye wastes have emerged as critical global public health concerns, posing significant risks to human and animal health, as well as to environmental sustainability. Green synthesized nano absorbents were found to be a viable strategy for treating drug-resistant pathogens and in wastewater. Hence, this study endeavored the synthesis of piperine-driven nano-zinc oxide (ZnONPs) and evaluated them for antibacterial, antibiofilm, and photocatalytic disinfection potential against multi-drug resistant (MDR) foodborne strains of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS). Besides, the dye degradation potential of ZnONPs when exposed to UV, sunlight, and LED lights and their antioxidant capacity were assessed. RESULTS: Initially, in silico analysis of piperine revealed drug-likeliness with minimal toxicity and strong interaction between piperine and OmpC motifs of Salmonella spp. UV spectroscopy of ZnONPs revealed a prominent absorption peak at 340 nm, while PXRD analysis confirmed the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnONPs by exhibiting peaks at 30°, 35.6°, 41.3°, 43.6°, 44.3°, 48°, 53°, 58°, and 59.2°, which corresponded to the lattice planes (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (004), (104), (210), and (211). Additionally, the TEM images demonstrated predominantly spherical ZnONPs with hexagonal wurtzite crystalline SAED pattern. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values (µg/mL) of the ZnONPs were found to be 62.50 and 125, respectively. The ZnONPs were observed to be safe with minimal hemolysis (less than 2%) in chicken RBCs, and no cytopathic effects were observed in the MTT assay using HEK cell lines. The NPs were found to be variably stable (high-end temperatures, proteases, cationic salts, and diverse pH), and were tested safe towards commensal gut lactobacilli. Additionally, in vitro time-kill kinetic assay indicated that the MDR-NTS strains were eliminated after co-incubating with ZnONPs for 6 h. The photocatalytic studies exhibited complete bacterial elimination under visible light at 4 h. Interestingly, the ZnONPs significantly inhibited the biofilm formation in the crystal violet staining assay by MDR-NTS strains (P < 0.001) at 24 and 48 h. Besides, a dose-dependent reducing power assay and 2,2'- azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS•+) assay were exhibited. Moreover, ZnONPs significantly degraded methylene blue, crystal violet, and rhodamine-B under different light sources (sunlight, UV light, and LED). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a sustainable one-pot method of synthesizing ZnONPs from piperine, which might be used as a viable antibacterial candidate with antioxidant, antibiofilm, and photocatalytic properties with eco-friendly implications and wastewater treatment.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To confirm the antifungal ability of piperine (PIP) and to assess its therapeutic potential in the treatment of Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) keratitis. METHODS: The toxicity of PIP was measured to determine the optimal therapeutic concentration both in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs), RAW264.7 cells and mice fungal keratitis models. The antifungal efficacy of PIP was confirmed through the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test, biofilm formation inhibition test, Calcofluor white and PI staining, and anti-adhesion of A. fumigatus conidia test. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, corneal fungal load assay, RT-qPCR, western blot, and Elisa were used to assess the therapeutic effect and anti-inflammatory ability of PIP in fungal keratitis. The significance of the mTOR/HIF-1α signal pathway after PIP treatment of A. fumigatus keratitis was evaluated. RESULTS: PIP had no obvious toxicity to HCECs, RAW 264.7 cells, or mouse cornea at the concentration of 30 µg/mL. PIP effectively inhibited A. fumigatus from growing and showed synergistic effects when combined with NATA. PIP not only reduced fungal load and the aggregation of inflammatory cells, but also dramatically reduced the expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD, GSDMD-N, IL-18, and IL-1β, which were linked to pyroptosis. Additionally, PIP decreased mTOR phosphorylation and HIF-1α expression. The pretreatment with mTOR agonists reversed the inhibition of NLRP3, caspase-1, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD, GSDMD-N, IL-18, and IL-1β protein levels caused by PIP. CONCLUSION: PIP exhibited antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties, and alleviated pyroptosis in A. fumigatus keratitis via inhibiting the mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluates the effects of oral supplementation of curcumin alone and curcumin plus piperine on body composition, phase angle, and functional capacity in patients with mild to moderate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with a diagnosis of IBD, aged 18 years or older with intact kidney and liver function, were into three groups: placebo, curcumin (1000 mg/day), and curcumin plus piperine (1000 mg/day + 10 mg/day). Anthropometric markers, body composition, phase angle (via tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis), and hand-grip strength were assessed before and after the 12-week supplementation period. Statistical analyses included Chi-square test (χ²) and generalized estimating equation (GEE) adjusted for age. Of the 58 patients who started the study, 51 completed it. Initially, obesity was prevalent according to BMI (43.1%) and body fat percentage (62.7%), while 86.3% exhibited muscle depletion based on fat-free mass (FFM). Post-intervention, the curcumin plus piperine group showed a significant reduction in muscle depletion, with improvements in FFM (χ², p = 0.019; GEE, p = 0.049) and phase angle (χ², p = 0.028) compared to the placebo group. In conclusion, our findings indicate that curcumin plus piperine significantly improves body composition by increasing muscle mass in patients with mild to moderate IBD, suggesting its potential as an adjuvant therapy.

      "abstract": "Melanin is a bio-pigment molecule synthesized by melanocytes. Its role is to shield the skin from ultraviolet radiation. Nonetheless, aberrant melanin production, whether excessive or deficient, can lead to conditions such as vitiligo, freckles, melanocytic nevi, and even melanoma. The biosynthetic pathway of melanin is known as melanogenesis, which is regulated by various transcription factors and enzymatic processes. Piperine (PPN), an alkaloid compound extracted from Piper retrofractum Vahl., was investigated for its potential anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory effects. Our hypothesis centered on the inhibition of melanin biosynthesis in response to PPN treatment. Subsequently, it was observed that PPN treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in melanin production, accompanied by a decrease in tyrosinase activity. Furthermore, PPN was found to downregulate the protein levels of key melanogenesis-related genes. Additionally, PPN was observed to elevate the phosphorylation levels of ERK. To assess the role of ERK signaling in PPN-induced melanogenesis regulation, PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, was used. When Melan-A cells were treated with PD98059, the reduced expression level of MITF and melanin content induced by piperine were restored. Additionally, phosphorylation of ERK increased the phosphorylation of MITF at Ser73. This phosphorylated MITF leads to ubiquitination, and ultimately, the protein level of MITF decreases through proteasomal degradation. Likewise, when Melan-A cells were treated with MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, the reduced expression level of MITF and melanin content induced by piperine were restored. Consequently, PPN can be a potential candidate for application as a skin whitening agent or in formulations to mitigate hyperpigmentation."

Piperine, a natural alkaloid extracted from black pepper, has demonstrated significant anticancer potential in recent years. Therefore, developing piperine derivatives to enhance its anticancer effects holds critical clinical significance. In this study, a novel piperine derivative, MHJ-LN, was designed and synthesized. Its anticancer effects against TNBC were systematically evaluated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The MTT assay, EdU incorporation assay, and colony formation assay were employed to assess the impact of MHJ-LN on TNBC cell proliferation. Tumor cell adhesion, scratch wound healing, and Transwell invasion assays were performed to analyze the antitumor activity of MHJ-LN. Additionally, apoptosis was detected using YO-PRO-1/PI staining, and immunofluorescence combined with Western blotting was used to assess the expression of p53 pathway-related proteins. MHJ-LN exhibited significant antitumor activity in the TNBC xenograft model. Its mechanism of antitumor action was found to depend on the activation of the MDM2-p53 pathway, effectively blocking G1/S cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. This research suggests that the piperine derivative MHJ-LN shows significant potential as an effective therapy targeting breast cancer."

Particularly glyceryl monooleate, in association with phosphatidylcholine and ethanol, were employed. Different ratios between excipients were tested, with the aim to obtain a liquid form suitable for subcutaneous injection, gaining a semisolid consistency in contact with biological fluids. A formulative study was conducted to assess the composition impact on the structural properties of the formulations, particularly focusing on injectability and phase transition. Curcumin and piperine were loaded, singularly or jointly, in selected in situ forming gels. Structural characterization, performed by X-ray scattering, revealed disordered reverse micellar phases, undergoing transition to hexagonal and cubic Pn3m phase upon hydration. In vitro dialysis release study demonstrated a sustained release of both drugs over 96 h, with a faster release in the case of jointly loaded drugs. Mechanistic analysis and water uptake studies indicated a drug release governed by both diffusion and swelling/erosion of the lipid supramolecular structure. Furthermore, an ex vivo release analysis performed using human skin explants suggested the formulation suitability for subcutaneous injection, indicating that the presence of piperine in the in situ formed gel allowed to double the curcumin release with respect to the simple curcumin loaded gel.",

The results showed that NPs-CP had an average size of 446.67 ± 40.27 nm and 367.6 ± 26.31 nm. On the formula NPs-CP-DMN the addition of PVA and PVP polymers (F2) resulted in DMNs with good mechanical strength and penetration ability, capable of penetrating five layers of Parafilm®. This formulation completely dissolved in 10 min without leaving any residue, with a curcumin flux value of 25.7 ± 0,51 µg/mL and piperine flux of 28.5 ± 0,51 µg/mL. The formulation showed no toxicity, with a hemolysis percentage of < 5 %, Tmax of 7 h, and Cmax values of 11.07 ± 0.31 µg/cm3 for curcumin and 17.40 ± 3.3 µg/cm3 for piperine. Moreover, this formulation effectively inhibited the P.falciparum FCR3 strain parasite, with an IC50 value of 35.9 μg/mL. Therefore, this study holds promise as a new strategy for malaria treatment.",

Variable proportions of carnauba wax, beeswax, and tween 80 were employed for preparing SLMs by using the solvent evaporation technique. The developed formulations were subjected to particle size measurements, entrapment efficiency (EE), and zeta potential (ZP) determination. Microparticles were also investigated for piperine-lipid compatibility, thermal analysis, surface morphology, piperine (PIP) release trend, and anti-rheumatic activity in rats. The network's grafting was confirmed by FTIR and XRD results. The thermal stability of the constructed network was confirmed by the DSC and TGA results. SEM findings confirm porous surface morphology. The dissolution experiments on SLMs confirmed the sustained release profile, delivering 87.82% to 94.92% of piperine at 7.4 pH for 24 h. All developed formulations followed a zero-order kinetic model and the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. Furthermore, the anti-rheumatic potentials of piperine from SLMs were also investigated and compared with diclofenac sodium (the standard treatment) in a rat model. The analysis revealed that PIP significantly reduced the severity of arthritis, as confirmed by the findings of multiple arthritic assessment parameters.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in the women. Chemotherapy is a crucial part of breast cancer treatment especially for advanced and metastatic forms of the disease. However, chemotherapy has limitations due to tumor heterogeneity, chemoresistance, and side effects. There is potential in combining chemotherapeutic drugs with natural items to enhance their effectiveness against cancer. In this study, we examined the synergistic effects of combining curcumin: piperine with sorafenib on the progression of breast cancer cells by altering many pathways associated with cancer and regulating the expression of numerous microRNAs. We tested the cytotoxic impact of curcumin: piperine on MCF-7 breast cancer cells using SRB assay. We analyzed the expression levels of selected microRNAs, genes, and proteins related to cancer stem cells, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, apoptosis and cell cycle progression using qPCR, ELISA and flow cytometry techniques. The findings of this study demonstrated that sorafenib and curcumin: piperine together enhances the suppression of MCF-7 cell survival. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that this combination provoked downregulation in oncomirs [miR-21 and miR-155], vimentin, Snail1, Notch, TGF-β1, Smad4, β-catenin1 and Wnt10b genes. Meanwhile, there were upregulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs [miR-28, miR-139 and miR-149] and E-cadherin gene expression level. Also, this combination resulted in a decrease of vimentin, IL-6, STAT3 and MMP-9; an increase of E-cadherin protein levels. Moreover, this combination induced apoptotic cell death and arrested cell cycles at specific phases. This study suggests that the combination of sorafenib and curcumin: piperine can combat breast cancer by modulating several microRNAs and signaling pathways involved in the development and progression of breast cancer.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Piperine, a secondary metabolite, affects the antihyperlipidemic effect of Ezetimibe (EZ). Hyperlipidemia is one of the independent risk factors for cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis. Antihyperlipidemic drugs are essential for reducing cardiovascular events and patient mortality. Our study aimed to improve the solubility of EZ, a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to BCS II and has low solubility. Piperine, a bioenhancer, can increase the bioavailability of other pharmaceuticals without modifying their fundamental characteristics or enhancing their efficacy. The objective of this study was to increase the bioavailability of EZ while also improving its potency and reducing its toxicity by using piperine as a bioenhancer. Therefore, rats were given piperine combined with EZ, and their antihyperlipidemic activity was assessed while fed a high-fat diet. METHOD: The in vivo antihyperlipidemic effect of EZ with piperine was assessed at doses of 10 and 5-20 mg/kg b.w. The evaluation was conducted using propylthiouracil-induced and triton X-100-induced hyperlipidemia in rats. Give 400 mg/kg body weight of propylthiouracil along with piperine. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) (p < 0.01), triglycerides (TG) (p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (p < 0.01), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) (p < 0.01) all went up significantly. Additionally, it led to the induction of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p < 0.01). Administration of Triton X-100 via intraperitoneal injection at a single dose resulted in an elevation of lipid levels. RESULTS: Lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) were significantly reduced by EZ at 10 mg/kg b.w. and piperine at 20 mg/kg b.w., respectively (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). Liver histology studies provided further evidence supporting the present findings. Areas of concentrated periportal lymphocytes and hepatocytes formed a cord pattern in rats with hyperlipidaemia. It seemed like the hepatocytes, periportal area, and centrilobular part of the liver were all normal in the group who had the treatment. An analysis of the EZ plasma drug concentration with time was carried out in a research. The medication's most effective concentration (Cmax) was determined to be within 4 h after delivery, and The quantified concentration of the active medication was detectable in the bloodstream for 24 h. CONCLUSION: In combination with piperine, EZ has demonstrated significant antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic effects. This indicates that EZ could be further utilised for treating hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis due to its potential to boost the bioavailability and oral absorption of the drug.",

Atorvastatin acts by reducing the production of cholesterol through the inhibition of the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG Co-A reductase) enzyme, whereas fenofibrate is a PPAR-α agonist. Piperine is an alkaloid mostly found in black pepper fruits. The present study was planned to evaluate the activities of atorvastatin, fenofibrate, and piperine on the male reproductive system. A total of 35 male Wistar rats were obtained for the experiment. Rats were randomly divided into 7 groups, each group with 5 rats. The experiment was run for 28 days. Group I rat got normal meals for 28 days; Group II received atorvastatin (08 mg/kg/day); Group III received piperine (10 mg/kg/day); and Group IV received fenofibrate (20 mg/kg/day). Group V received atorvastatin (8 mg/kg/day) and piperine (10 mg/kg/day); Group VI received piperine (10 mg/kg/day) and fenofibrate (20 mg/kg/day). VII received fenofibrate (20 mg/kg bw/day) and atorvastatin (8 mg/kg/day). After sacrifice, serum and testicular cholesterol and testosterone levels assessed by ELISA, ROS generation analysed by using flow cytometry, MDA, SOD, and catalase were measured. Histological, sperm-parameter analysis, and spermatogenic evaluations were also done. Activities of atorvastatin and piperine revealed reproductive toxicity upon treatment. Fenofibrate treatment, along with atorvastatin and piperine, showed protective effects. In conclusion, atorvastatin and piperine affected reproductive potential, whereas fenofibrate might have protective efficacy against atorvastatin and piperine-induced reproductive toxicity."

This study evaluates in vitro protoscolicidal activity of piperine-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PIP-MSNs) against protoscoleces of Echinococcus granulosus. MSNs were prepared by adding tetraethyl orthosilicate to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and NaOH, and then loaded with PIP. The mean particle size and hydrodynamic diameter of MSNs were determined at 68 ± 4.5 and 101.4 ± 50.4 nm using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering, respectively. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared analysis, and UV-spectrophotometry confirmed drug loading. Drug loading efficiency and drug loading capacity were calculated at 60% and 18%, respectively. The drug release profile confirmed a 75% PIP release plateau after about 24 h. The cytotoxicity assay showed cell viability > 90% in all concentrations used (≤ 512 µg/mL). E. granulosus protoscoleces were exposed to PIP-MSNs and their viability was assessed using the eosin exclusion test. In a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001), exposure to 375 and 500 µg/mL of PIP-MSNs for 180 min killed 89.67 and 94.67% of protoscoleces, respectively. This study introduces PIP-MSNs as a potential protoscolicidal agent in the treatment of CE. Further studies are necessary to uncover safety aspects, biodistribution patterns, and potential combination therapies.",

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of curcumin-piperine on laboratory factors and macular vascular in DR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm clinical trial that was conducted on 60 patients with DR aged 30-65 years. Patients were randomized into two groups to receive (i) 1010 mg/day of curcumin-piperine (two tablets per day, each tablet containing 500 mg curcuminoids and 5 mg piperine) (n = 30) or (ii) the matched placebo (n = 30) for 12 weeks. The investigated factors included optical coherence tomography (OCT), optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), oxidative stress factors, C-reactive protein (CRP), fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglycerides (TGs), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine. RESULTS: The trial was completed by 27 patients in the intervention group and 29 patients in the placebo group. Curcumin-piperine significantly increased total antioxidant capacity (0.86 ± 0.66 vs. 0.45 ± 0.89; P = 0.022) and superoxide dismutases (0.77 ± 2.11 vs. -0.45 ± 3.08; P = 0.031), while it decreased and malondialdehyde (MDA) (-1.06 ± 5.80 vs. 1.89 ± 6.12; P = 0.043) and creatinine (-0.04 ± 0.16 vs. 0.03 ± 0.05; P = 0.042) compared with placebo. However, this supplement had no significant effect on CRP, FBG, TG, BUN, OCT, and OCTA. There were no adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: Curcumin-piperine is effective in improving oxidative stress and reducing creatinine in DR. Further trials are necessary to confirm these promising findings."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 and Hep3B) and non-cancerous hepatocyte (AML12) cell lines were used. The cell viability was determined by using MTT assay. Cellular stresses, apoptosis, and JNK signaling markers were measured by Western blotting. Cells were pre-treated with SP600125 as a JNK inhibitor. The inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) values and interaction of piperine with sorafenib were calculated by using CompuSyn software. IC50 values of piperine were 97 µM for HepG2, 58 µM for Hep3B, and 184 µM for AML12 with incubation for 48 h. Piperine caused a significant concentration-dependent increase in cellular stresses, apoptosis, and activated JNK signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Pre-treatment with a JNK inhibitor significantly reduced piperine-induced cellular stresses, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity. Piperine had concentration-dependent additive or synergistic effects when combined with sorafenib in both HepG2 and Hep3B cells. We found that piperine induces cellular stresses, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity via JNK signaling and has concentration-dependently additive or synergistic effects with sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma."

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that microglia contribute to the occurrence and development of cancer-associated pain. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which piperine influences cancer-associated pain induced by microglia activation. METHODS: The tumor cell implantation (TCI) model was adopted as the cancer-associated pain model in mice. Behavioral tests were done to confirm that model mice were sensitive to acute mechanical and thermal pain. Western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) were conducted to quantify expression level of microglia marker protein Iba1 in mice spinal cord tissues. The expression of miR-150-5p and CXCL12 in the mice spinal cord was evaluated by Quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Primary microglia from mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to investigate neuroinflammation. RESULTS: The modeled mice showed high susceptibility to acute mechanical hyperalgesia and thermal hyperalgesia. The expression of microglia marker protein Iba1 in the model group was increased in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with piperine effectively relieved the cancer-associated pain in mice. The results of FISH and qRT-PCR showed that piperine significantly increased the expression of miR-150-5p and reduced the expression of CXCL12 in the spinal cord of mice. Furthermore, it inhibited the microglia-induced cancer-associated pain. CONCLUSIONS: Piperine upregulates miR-150-50p levels, inhibits CXCL12 expression, and reduces microglia levels at the lesion site. Therefore, piperine may be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of cancer-associated pain.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objective: Hepatic drug intoxication is becoming increasingly common with the increasing use of chronic medications. Piperine has emerged as a promising alternative for protecting the liver against drug-induced injury. We evaluated the prophylactic effects of piperine in C57BL/6 mice with an acute liver injury induced by a paracetamol (APAP) overdose. Methods: Piperine was administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg (P20) or 40 mg/kg (P40) for eight consecutive days before the animals were exposed to a hepatotoxic dose of paracetamol (500 mg/kg). The animals were euthanized 3 h after the paracetamol overdose. Results: The prophylactic treatment with piperine (P20 and P40) maintained the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the biomarkers of oxidative damage (TBARS and carbonylated proteins), which were statistically similar to those for the control group. The extent of hepatocyte necrosis and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) levels were lower than those in the group exposed to liver injury (APAP group). Piperine modulated the gene expression of CYP2E1 (cytochrome P4502E1) and the inflammasome pathway (NLRP3, CASP-1, IL-1β, and IL-18), which play a crucial role in the inflammatory response. In the P40 group, the degree of hepatic hyperemia was similar to that in the control group, as was the increase in metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) activity. Conclusion: Piperine has demonstrated beneficial and promising effects for the prevention of liver injury resulting from paracetamol-induced drug intoxication."

Physiochemical characterization studies showed that the particle size of blank and drug-loaded surfactant stabilized zein nanoparticles were <200 nm and particles were spherical in shape. FTIR studies confirmed the successful incorporation of piperine within the zein nanoparticle without any alteration in primary structure of zein. The circular dichroism spectroscopy suggested that α-helix content of zein was reduced following the incorporation of drug within nanoparticles. The solubility of piperine was enhanced significantly in the gastrointestinal tract, and higher sustained release was observed for tween 80-stablized zein nanoparticles. The formulations were stable towards thermal treatment up to 90 °C, showed superior resistance towards aggregation even at ionic strength >50 mM NaCl, and did not show any aggregation even at the isoelectric pH. Tween 80-stablized zein nanoparticles showed good redispersibility index with the cryoprotectant mannose (5 % w/v) after lyophilization. The current research would contribute to the advancement of zein nanoparticles for the delivery of nutraceutical agents, which may be utilized in the food supplements or therapeutic agents to improve the human health.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Paraquat (PQ), a widely used non-selective herbicide, induces severe lung toxicity by promoting cell death and tissue necrosis through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals. This study aimed to develop and evaluate novel niosomal nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating curcumin and piperine to mitigate PQ-induced acute pulmonary toxicity in Balb/c mice. METHODS: The NPs were prepared using non-ionic surfactants and cholesterol via the thin film hydration method. RESULTS: Characterization revealed high encapsulation efficiency (>85%), proper particle sizes (264-286 nm), narrow polydispersity index (PDI) (0.19 ± 0.04 to 0.23 ± 0.02), and good stability over 90 days. Thermal analysis confirmed successful encapsulation of curcumin and piperine within the niosomal NPs. In vivo studies showed that PQ exposure significantly elevated ROS, lipid peroxidation (LPO), and protein carbonylation (PC) levels, while reducing glutathione (GSH) levels and impairing mitochondrial function (P < 0.001). However, co-treatment with curcumin- and piperine-loaded niosomal NPs effectively reversed these effects (P < 0.001), improving mitochondrial function. CONCLUSION: The combined formulation of curcumin and piperine in niosomal NPs offers a promising therapeutic strategy for treating PQ-induced pulmonary toxicity, likely due to enhanced bioavailability and potent antioxidant activity."

Orlistat is one of the most widely used drugs in the management of obesity due to its accessibility and low cost. However, cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported due to the consumption of this drug. On the other hand, piperine is an alkaloid found in black pepper that has demonstrated antiobesity, antihyperlipidemic, antioxidant, prebiotic, and hepatoprotective effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of piperine on the toxicity of orlistat in liver tissue. Obese male rats were administered piperine (30 mg/kg), orlistat (60 mg/kg), and the orlistat-piperine combination (30 mg/kg + 60 mg/kg) daily for 6 weeks. It was observed that the orlistat-piperine treatment resulted in greater weight loss, decreased biochemical markers (lipid profile, liver enzymes, pancreatic lipase activity), and histopathological analysis showed decreased hepatic steatosis and reduction of duodenal inflammation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the administration of piperine with orlistat increased the expression of genes related to the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, carbohydrate metabolism, detoxification of xenobiotics, and response to oxidative stress. Therefore, the results suggest that the administration of orlistat-piperine activates signaling pathways that confer a hepatoprotective effect, reducing the toxic impact of this drug.",

      "abstract": "Anticancer drug discovery needs serious attention to overcome the high mortality rate caused by cancer. There are still many obstacles to treating this disease, such as the high cost of chemotherapeutic drugs, the resulting side effects from the drug, and the occurrence of multidrug resistance. Herbaceous plants are a reservoir of natural compounds that can be anticancer drugs with novel mechanisms of action. Piperine, a bioactive compound derived from Piper species, is gaining attention due to its unique dual role in directly inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing the bioavailability of chemotherapeutic drugs. Unlike conventional treatments, Piperine exhibits a novel mechanism of action by modulating multiple signaling pathways, including apoptosis and autophagy, with low toxicity. Additionally, Piperine acts as a bioenhancer by improving the absorption and effectiveness of other anticancer agents, reducing the required dosage, and minimizing side effects. Therefore, this review aims to visualize a summary of Piperine sources, phytochemistry, chemical structure-anticancer activity relationship, anticancer activities of semi-synthetic derivatives, pharmacokinetic and bioavailability, in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, mechanism of antitumor action, human clinical trials, toxicity, side effects, and safety of Piperine. References were collected from the Pubmed/MedLine database (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with the following keywords: \"Piperine anticancer,\" \"Piperine derivatives,\" \"Piperine antitumor mechanism\" and \"Piperine pharmacokinetic and bioavailability,\" after filter process by inclusion and exclusion criteria, 101 were selected from 444 articles. From 2013 to 2023, there were numerous studies regarding preclinical studies of Piperine of various cell lines, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, cervical cancer, gastric cancer, osteosarcoma, colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer, and hypopharyngeal carcinoma. In vivo, the anticancer study has also been conducted on some animal models, such as Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing mice, Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells-bearing Balbc mice, hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing Wistar rat, A375SM cells-bearing mice, A375P cells-bearing mice, SNU-16 cells-bearing BalbC mice, and HGC-27-bearing baby mice. Treatment with this compound leads to cell proliferation inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Piperine has been used for clinical trials of diseases, but no cancer patient report exists. Various semi-synthetic derivatives of Piperine show efficacy as an anticancer drug across multiple cell lines. Piperine shows promise for use in cancer clinical trials, either as a standalone treatment or as a bioenhancer. Its bioenhancer properties may enhance the efficacy of existing chemotherapeutic agents, providing a valuable foundation for developing new anticancer therapies.",

The PBPK model for piperine was successfully developed and validated. Using this model, FDIs with ten CYP3A4 substrate drugs were simulated. The predicted area under the curve (AUC) ratios (with and without piperine, following a 7-day intake of 20 mg/day) for six drugs were found to exceed 1.25, with significant increases in AUC observed for ritonavir (31%), nifedipine (34%), cyclosporine (35%), triazolam (36%), alfentanil (39%), and simvastatin (59%) in humans. These findings suggest that caution should be exercised when consuming amounts of black pepper equivalent to a daily intake of 20 mg piperine during treatment with CYP3A4 substrate drugs, as it may significantly alter their pharmacokinetics.",

      "abstract": "Radiotherapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of solid tumors, with extensive Phase III trials confirming its effectiveness. As advancements in treatment technologies and our understanding of tumor resistance mechanisms continue, the role of radiation oncology is set to become even more pivotal. Addressing the global challenge of lethal cancers demands innovative strategies, particularly in minimizing the side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy and ionizing radiation (IR). Recently, there has been growing interest in natural compounds for radioprotection, aiming to prevent tumor development and metastasis. Piperine, a compound found in black and long pepper, has emerged as a promising chemopreventive agent that works effectively without harming normal cells. Mechanistically, piperine modulates key signaling pathways, inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion, and enhances sensitivity to IR. Combining piperine with radiotherapy offers a compelling approach, boosting treatment efficacy while protecting healthy tissues from radiation damage. Piperine's versatile role goes beyond radiosensitization to include radioprotection by inhibiting NF-κB activation, reducing autophagy, and promoting apoptosis in cancer cells. This dual action makes it a promising candidate for personalized cancer care. As research advances, the therapeutic potential of piperine may drive new frontiers in cancer treatment strategies.",

The in silico analysis predicted the drug-likeness, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profile of PPN, along with evaluating its binding affinity and ligand-receptor interactions. Results indicate that PPN significantly (p < 0.05) reduced licking frequency and paw edoema in a dose-dependent manner. However, in combination therapy, PPN diminished the effects of both CXB and KPN. PPN showed high affinity (-8.6 kcal/mol) towards the COX-2 enzyme. Therefore, PPN exerts anti-inflammatory effects in chicks through COX-2 inhibition pathways and antagonises CXB and KPN activities."

Piperine (PIP), an alkaloid found in black pepper, has anti-inflammatory properties and its use in drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles might be a treatment for RA. This study aims to evaluate the possible anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects of PIP and its use in albumin nanoparticles as a possible approach for the treatment of Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats. METHODS: PIP-loaded Bovine Serum Albumin nanoparticles (PIP-BSA NPs) were prepared using a desolvation method. AIA rats were given intraperitoneal injections of either 40 mg PIP or 131 mg PIP-BSA NPs every two days until day 28 when animals were sacrificed. Clinical score, histopathology, X-ray radiography, and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-17, and TNF-α were evaluated. RESULTS: PIP and PIP-BSA NPs significantly reduced clinical scores, and alleviated inflammation within the joints. PIP was superior to PIP-BSA NPs for the alleviation of fibrin deposition and periosteal reactions while bone inflammation and erosion were less severe in the case of PIP-BSA NPs. Besides, both of the treatments suppressed serum levels of IL-17 in AIA rats (p = 0.003 and p = 0.02; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PIP and PIP-BSA NPs effectively alleviate the severity of AIA and suppress inflammation. Due to the superiority of PIP in improving fibrin deposition and periosteal reactions and the efficacy of PIP-BSA NPs in suppressing bone inflammation and erosion, their simultaneous use might be investigated.",

Natural products have proven to be highly valuable as complementary, or adjunctive in the treatment of cancer. Piperine, a natural compound derived from Piper nigrum, demonstrates anti-proliferative and anti-neoplastic effects across various types of cancer. This study focused on assessing the cytotoxic effect of piperine in conjunction with cisplatin within the OSCC cell line. METHODS: In this in-vitro study, cultured OSCC cells were divided into four groups: a control group (untreated), a group exposed solely to piperine, a group exposed solely to cisplatin, and a group receiving both piperine and cisplatin. Cell viability was determined by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay technique. Additionally, flow cytometric analysis was employed to examine cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Assessment of reactive oxygen species activity, morphological changes, and nuclear area factor measurements were carried out. Expression of the apoptotic regulator Bax was assessed through western blotting analysis. RESULTS: Piperine has cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. Piperine in combination with cisplatin exhibited a synergistic effect, resulting in more pronounced inhibition of cell viability in OSCC cells compared to using piperine and cisplatin alone. Piperine and cisplatin for 24 h induced apoptosis strongly by increasing Bax protein and ROS activity. CONCLUSION: Combining piperine with cisplatin demonstrated a greater effectiveness in triggering apoptosis in OSCC cells compared to using cisplatin alone, allowing for a reduction.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Obesity is a complex multifaceted disease, characterized by excessive body fat accumulation. It is a major public health concern globally, affecting individuals of all ages, genders, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Lipase, a key enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of dietary fats. Pancreatic lipase performs hydrolysis of nearly 50%-70% of total dietary fats. Thus, inhibition of pancreatic lipase is recognized as one of the strategies for managing obesity. Aim To predict the effect of phytocompounds from pepper as pancreatic lipase inhibitors using computational approaches. Methodology The drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties of compounds were evaluated using Lipinski rule of five and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) analysis, respectively. The drug score value was computed using Molinspiration, while the lipase inhibitor potential of ligands was evaluated using prediction of activity spectra for substances. Molecular docking was carried out to evaluate the stability and ligand binding affinity. Results Computational approaches identified both piperine and capsaicin as potential candidates, exhibiting favorable affinities with binding energy values of -9.9 and -7.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Both piperine and capsaicin interacted with Ser-152 and His-263, demonstrating their binding at the substrate binding site. Conclusions Findings provide insights into the underlying anti-obesity potential of these bioactive compounds from pepper and support further experimental investigations for obesity treatment."

      "abstract": "Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a multifaceted metabolic and hormonal condition that impacts women in their procreative ages, identified by ovarian dysfunction, hyperandrogenaemia overweight and insulin insensitivity. The piperine, an important alkaloid compound of black pepper has shown promise in modulating various physiological processes. In this work, employed computational docking studies to explore the potential of piperine as a treatment for PCOS. Utilizing computational methods, we analyzed the binding interactions between piperine and key molecular targets implicated in PCOS pathogenesis, including hyperandrogenism, and \"oligomenorrhea. The network pharmacology analysis report found 988 PCOS-related genes, 108 hyperandrogenism-related genes, and 377 oligomenorrhea-related genes, and we finally shortlisted 5 common genes in PCOS, hyperandrogenism, and \"oligomenorrhea\": NR3C1, PPARG, FOS, CYP17A1, and H6PD. Our results reveal favorable binding affinities with PPARG (-8.34 Kcal/mol) and H6PD (-8.70 Kcal/mol) and interaction patterns, suggesting the potential of piperine to modulate these targets. Moreover, the reliability of the piperine-target interactions was revealed by molecular simulations studies. These findings support further experimental investigations to validate the therapeutic efficacy of piperine in PCOS management. The integration of computational approaches with experimental studies has the potential to lay the groundwork for the creation of new therapies specifically targeting PCOS and related endocrine disorders.",

      "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a coccidian protozoan of zoonotic importance that causes toxoplasmosis. Although the current treatments for toxoplasmosis may be associated with adverse effects and limited efficacy for different biological forms of the parasite, evidence suggests that alkaloid molecules such as harmaline and piperine exhibit antiparasitic effects against protozoa parasites. This investigation aimed to evaluate the in vitro effect of harmaline and piperine against T. gondii tachyzoites in infected Vero cell cultures. After 24 hours of host cell infection, the cultures were treated with harmaline or piperine (0.49 to 15.63 µg/mL). Negative and positive controls were RPMI/DMSO (0.1%) and sulfadiazine (200 µg/mL). Harmaline significantly reduced parasite multiplication by 20% compared to the negative control, while piperine decreased between 55.56% and 88.89% in a dose-dependent manner. According to an intracellular parasite proportion scale, it was observed that the Vero cells with low or moderate parasitic proliferation were more prevalent after the alkaloid treatment. The study demonstrated that the alkaloids had antiparasitic effects on T. gondii, with piperine being the most effective. Additional studies must be carried out to clarify other aspects of the action of the alkaloids on parasites.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of many genetic neurodegenerative diseases, but therapeutic options to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction are limited. While recent studies support the possibility of improving mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics and motility to correct mitochondrial dysfunction and resulting neurodegeneration in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and other neuropathies, the clinical utility of reported compounds and relevance of preclinical models are uncertain. Here, we describe motor and sensory neuron dysfunction characteristic of clinical CMT type 2 A in a CRISPR/Casp-engineered Mfn2 Thr105Met (T105M) mutant knock-in mouse. We further demonstrate that daily oral treatment with a novel mitofusin activator derived from the natural product piperine can reverse these neurologic phenotypes. Piperine derivative 8015 promoted mitochondrial fusion and motility in Mfn2-deficient cells in a mitofusin-dependent manner and reversed mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured fibroblasts and reprogrammed motor neurons from a human CMT2A patient carrying the MFN2 T105M mutation. Like previous mitofusin activators, 8015 exhibited stereospecific functionality, but the more active stereoisomer, 8015-P2, is unique in that it has subnanomolar potency and undergoes entero-hepatic recirculation which extends its in vivo half-life. Daily administration of 8015-P2 to Mfn2 T105M knock-in mice for 6 weeks normalized neuromuscular and sensory dysfunction and corrected histological/ultrastructural neurodegeneration and neurogenic myoatrophy. These studies describe a more clinically relevant mouse model of CMT2A and an improved mitofusin activator derived from piperine. We posit that 8015-P2 and other piperine derivatives may benefit CMT2A or other neurodegenerative conditions wherein mitochondrial dysdynamism plays a contributory role. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Mitochondrial dysfunction is widespread and broadly contributory in neurodegeneration, but difficult to target therapeutically. Here, we describe 8015-P2, a new small molecule mitofusin activator with ∼10-fold greater potency and improved in vivo pharmacokinetics versus comparators, and demonstrate its rapid reversal of sensory and motor neuron dysfunction in an Mfn2 T105M knock-in mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 A. These findings further support the therapeutic approach of targeting mitochondrial dysdynamism in neurodegeneration.",

      "abstract": "Curcumin and piperine are plant compounds known for their health-promoting properties, but their use in the prevention or treatment of various diseases is limited by their poor solubility. To overcome this drawback, the curcumin-piperine amorphous polymer-phospholipid dispersions were prepared by hot melt extrusion technology. X-ray powder diffraction indicated the formation of amorphous systems. Differential scanning calorimetry confirmed amorphization and provided information on the good miscibility of the active compound-polymer-phospholipid dispersions. Owing to Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, the intermolecular interactions in systems were investigated. In the biopharmaceutical properties assessment, the improvement in solubility as well as the maintenance of the supersaturation state were confirmed. Moreover, PAMPA models simulating the gastrointestinal tract and blood-brain barrier showed enhanced permeability of active compounds presented in dispersions compared to the crystalline form of individual compounds. The presented paper suggests that polymer-phospholipid dispersions advantageously impact the bioaccessibility of poorly soluble active compounds."

EAU was induced by immunization with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant. Starting from day 8 post-induction, Lewis rats were given piperine (0, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg-P.O.) or prednisolone (10 mg/kg-P.O.) for 18 consecutive days. The 80 mg/kg dose of piperine demonstrated superior regression of clinical symptoms, increased nitric oxide levels, and enhanced IDO activity in eye homogenates compared to other doses. The 40 and 80 mg/kg doses of piperine were more effective in promoting weight gain in EAU rats than the 20 mg/kg dose. EAU rats treated with 80 mg/kg piperine showed more favorable mRNA expression of IL-10 and TGF-β in their eyes than other treatment groups. The interventions led to a significant decrease in mRNA ratios of T-bet/GATA-3, RORγt/T-bet, RORγt/Foxp3, and RORγt/GATA-3 in the eyes of EAU rats compared to untreated EAU rats. Specifically, EAU rats treated with 80 mg/kg piperine exhibited a greater reduction in the mRNA ratio of RORγt/Foxp3 expression compared to other treatment groups. Overall, oral administration of piperine may offer potential for clinical application in uveitis."

Owing to the putative metabolic benefits of curcumin-piperine combination, we explored the efficacy of this combination in improving cardiometabolic indices of patients with T2DM and hypertriglyceridemia. In this double-blind clinical trial, 72 patients with T2DM and hypertriglyceridemia were randomized to receive either a tablet containing 500 mg of curcuminoids plus 5 mg of piperine, or a matched placebo for 12 weeks. Anthropometric indices, blood pressure, glycemic indices, lipid profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), quality of life, and mood were evaluated at baseline and end of the study. After 12 weeks of intervention, the levels of triglycerides (p-value = 0.001) and fasting blood glucose (p-value = 0.004) were significantly reduced in the curcumin-piperine compared with the placebo group. CRP levels were marginally reduced in the curcumin-piperine compared with the placebo group (p-value = 0.081). In addition, energy/fatigue significantly increased in the curcumin-piperine group compared to the control group (p-value = 0.024). However, between-group comparisons showed no significant change in other parameters, including anthropometric indices (waist circumference and body mass index (BMI)), biochemical parameters (low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c), and insulin), HOMA-IR, blood pressure, quality of life, and DASS-21 items between the studied groups (p-value >0.05).

      "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in chemotherapy, effective treatments for advanced cancer stages remain largely elusive due to chemoresistance. Resistance to anticancer agents in cancer cells can arise through various mechanisms, including multi-drug resistance, inhibition of apoptosis, modification of drug targets, and enhancement of DNA repair capabilities. Consequently, there is a critical need for agents that can suppress the molecular signatures responsible for drug resistance. Piperine, an active alkaloid extracted from Piper nigrum L. (black pepper), is one such agent that has been extensively studied for its potential in addressing chronic diseases, including cancer. Piperine's antineoplastic properties are mediated through the regulation of numerous key cellular signaling pathways and the modulation of various biological processes. Its capability to enhance drug bioavailability and counteract mechanisms of drug resistance, such as the inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP-1), emphasizes its potential as an adjunct in cancer therapy. Research across various cancer types has demonstrated piperine's role in chemosensitization by targeting P-gp and MRP-1 and altering drug-metabolizing enzymes. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of piperine's pharmacological characteristics and its capacity to modulate several cellular signaling pathways involved in drug resistance. Furthermore, the review emphasizes how piperine, when used in conjunction with other chemotherapeutic agents or natural compounds, can enhance therapeutic effects, leading to improved outcomes in cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that lacks an actionable target with limited treatment options beyond conventional chemotherapy. Therapeutic failure is often encountered due to inherent or acquired resistance to chemotherapy. Previous studies implicated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in cancer stem cells (CSCs) enrichment and hence chemoresistance. The present study aimed at investigating the potential effect of piperine (PIP), an amide alkaloid isolated from Piper nigrum, on enhancing the sensitivity of TNBC cells to doxorubicin (DOX) in vitro on MDA-MB-231 cell line and in vivo in an animal model of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma solid tumor. Results showed a synergistic interaction between DOX and PIP on MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, the combination elicited enhanced suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling that paralleled an upregulation in this pathway's negative regulator, PTEN, along with a curtailment in the levels of the CSCs surrogate marker, aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH-1). Meanwhile, in vivo investigations demonstrated the potential of the combination regimen to enhance necrosis while downregulating PTEN and curbing PI3K levels as well as p-Akt, mTOR, and ALDH-1 immunoreactivities. Notably, the combination failed to change cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase levels suggesting a pro-necrotic rather than pro-apoptotic mechanism. Overall, these findings suggest a potential role of PIP in decreasing the resistance to DOX in vitro and in vivo, likely by interfering with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and CSCs.",

Antioxidant therapy is a promising therapeutic option to enhance the clinical results of these individuals in this particular scenario. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of curcumin, with or without piperine, on cytokines, fecal calprotectin (CalF), and oxidative stress enzymatic and non-enzymatic indicators in patients with IBD. METHODS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) who were at least 18 years old and had intact liver and kidney function participated in this randomized, double-blind trial (trial registration: ensaiosclinicos.gov.br as RBR-89q4ydz). For 12 weeks, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: placebo, curcumin (1000 mg/day), or curcumin plus piperine (1000 mg + 10 mg/day). In order to examine oxidative stress indicators, CalF, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, blood and fecal samples were obtained, both prior to and following the intervention time. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, and type of IBD, the curcumin plus piperine group had substantially higher serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) than the placebo group (4346.9 ± 879.0 vs. 3614.5 ± 731.5; p = 0.041). There were no discernible variations between the groups in CalF, inflammatory markers, or other indicators of oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), our study indicates that a 12-week curcumin plus piperine treatment effectively increases enzymatic antioxidant defense, especially SOD. These results demonstrate the potential therapeutic benefits of managing redox imbalance in individuals with IBD."

Forty-eight male Wistar rats (230 g, six-eight weeks old) were randomly divided into six groups (n = 8): sham, paraquat (5 mg/kg three times a week; intraperitoneally), paraquat + piperine (10 mg/kg/day; orally), paraquat + aerobic exercise training, paraquat + piperine + aerobic exercise training; and paraquat + vitamin E (20 mg/kg/day; orally) as a positive control. Rats were sacrificed on day 50, and both lung tissues were isolated to measure oxidative (MDA), anti-oxidative (GSH), inflammatory (TNF-α), anti-inflammatory (IL-10) markers, and histological evaluations (hematoxylin-eosin staining). The results of the present study revealed that paraquat significantly decreased body weight, GSH, GSH/MDA ratio, IL-10, and IL-10/TNF-α ratio while increasing MDA, TNF-α, and histopathological damage in lung tissue (P < 0.01 to 0.001). In contrast, treatment with all four interventions meaningfully diminished oxidative, inflammatory markers, and histopathological damage while propagating body weight, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory markers following the paraquat-induced lung damage (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). Interestingly, piperine and piperine + exercise training possessed stronger protective effects against paraquat-induced lung damage than exercise training alone (P < 0.01 to 0.001). Treatment with piperine, exercise training, piperine + exercise training, and vitamin E significantly ameliorated paraquat-induced lung damage. Interestingly, the piperine and piperine + exercise training had more protective effects than other groups. Therefore, piperine and the combination of piperine and exercise training may be valuable candidates for preventing lung injuries."

      "abstract": "Candidemia leaves a trail of approximately 750,000 cases yearly, with a morbidity rate of up to 30%. While Candida albicans still ranks as the most predominantly isolated Candida species, C. glabrata comes in second, with a death rate of 40-50%. Although infections by Candida spp are commonly treated with azoles, the side effects and rise in resistance against it has significantly limited its clinical usage. The current study aims to address the insolubility of piperine and provide an alternative treatment to Candida infection by formulating a stable piperine-loaded O/W nanoemulsion, comprised of Cremophor RH40, Transcutol HP and Capryol 90 as surfactant, co-surfactant, and oil, respectively. Characterization with zetasizer showed the droplet size, polydispersity (PDI) and zetapotential value of the nanoemulsion to be 24.37 nm, 0.453 and -21.10 mV, respectively, with no observable physical changes such as phase separation from thermostability tests. FTIR peaks confirms presence of piperine within the nanoemulsion and TEM imaging visualized the droplet shape and further confirms the droplet size range of 20-24 nm. The MIC90 value of the piperine-loaded nanoemulsion determined with in vitro broth microdilution assay was approximately 20-50% lower than that of the pure piperine in DMSO, at a range of 0.8-2.0 mg/mL across all Candida spp. tested. Overall, the study showed that piperine can be formulated into a stable nanoemulsion, which significantly enhances its antifungal activity compared to piperine in DMSO.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is a significant and ever-growing concern, causing high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Conventional therapy is often very precarious and requires long-term usage. Several phytochemicals, including Resveratrol (RSV) and Piperine (PIP), possess significant cardioprotection and may be restrained in clinical settings due to inadequate pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, this study strives to develop an optimized RSV phytosomes (RSVP) and RSV phytosomes co-loaded with PIP (RPP) via solvent evaporation method using Box-Behnken design to enhance the pharmacokinetic properties in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction (MI). The optimized particle size (20.976 ± 0.39 and 176.53 ± 0.88 nm), zeta potential (-33.33 ± 1.5 and -48.7 ± 1.6 mV), drug content (84.57 ± 0.9 and 87.16 ± 0.6%), and %EE (70.56 ± 0.7 and 67.60 ± 0.57%) of the prepared RSVP and RPP, respectively demonstrated enhanced solubility and control release in diffusion media. The oral administration of optimized RSVP and RPP in myocardial infarction-induced rats exhibited significant (p < 0.001) improvement in heart rate, ECG, biomarker, anti-oxidant levels, and no inflammation than pure RSV. The pharmacokinetic assessment on healthy Wistar rats exhibited prolonged circulation (>24 h) of RSVP and RPP compared to free drug/s. The enhanced ability of RSVP and RPP to penetrate bio-membranes and enter the systemic circulation renders them a more promising strategy for mitigating MI.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a significant cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, necessitating the identification of novel therapeutic targets and treatments. This research aimed to investigate the role of ARL3 in COAD progression and to explore the effects of Piperine on ARL3 expression, cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Bioinformatics analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-COAD, GSE39582, and GSE44861 datasets assessed ARL3 expression levels. Immunohistochemical data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database confirmed ARL3 overexpression in COAD. The association of ARL3 with COAD clinical parameters and prognosis was also examined. COAD cells were treated with Piperine, and in vitro assays evaluated cell proliferation, apoptosis, EMT marker expression, and ER stress (ERS) responses. ARL3 overexpression in COAD correlated with poor prognosis and varied across pathological stages. Piperine treatment inhibited COAD cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, as indicated by reduced Ki-67 levels and decreased colony-forming ability. Piperine induced S-phase cell cycle arrest and facilitated apoptosis in COAD cells, evidenced by changes in Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) levels. Moreover, Piperine downregulated ARL3 expression in COAD cells, thereby suppressing transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-induced EMT. Additionally, Piperine attenuated the ARL3-mediated ER stress response, significantly reducing binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (p-IRE1α), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) levels. Piperine exerts anti-cancer effects in COAD by modulating ARL3 expression, disrupting cell cycle progression, inhibiting the EMT pathway, and regulating ERS. These findings suggest that Piperine holds promise as a therapeutic agent for COAD through its targeting of ARL3.",

Piperine, an alkaloid molecule extracted from Piper nigrum and Piper longum, has emerged as a promising anticancer agent. However, the molecular mechanisms of piperine' antitumor effects in CRC need to be further elucidated. METHODS: Human colorectal cancer cells were treated with piperine in vitro. CCK-8 and clone formation assays were adopted to detect cell viability. The accumulation of autophagosomes was assessed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed by flow. In vivo, a xenograft tumor mouse model was constructed using CT26 cells. RESULTS: Piperine inhibited CRC cell viability and suppressed tumor weight and volume in a mouse model. Additionally, piperine treatment induced the accumulation of autophagosomes in CRC cells. This effect was attributed to the inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway and the accumulation of ROS. activation of AKT or clearance of ROS attenuated piperine-mediated tumor suppression. CONCLUSION: This study shows that piperine induces autophagy-dependent cell death in CRC cells by increasing ROS production and inhibiting Akt/mTOR signaling.",

      "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide (CP) is an antineoplastic drug widely used in chemotherapy. Curcumin (CUR) and piperine (PP) show a protective effect on neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. This research was designed to measure several biochemical parameters in the brain tissue of CP-applied rats to investigate the impact of combined CUR-PP administration. The study evaluated six groups of eight rats: Group 1 was the control; Groups 2 and 3 were administered 200 or 300 mg/kg CUR-PP via oral gavage; Group 4 received only 200 mg/kg CP on day 1; Groups 5 and 6 received CP + CUR-PP for 7 days. Data from all parameters indicated that CP caused brain damage. Phosphorylated TAU (pTAU), amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Aβ1-42), glutamate (GLU), and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) parameters were the same in Groups 4, 5, and 6. On the other hand, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kβ), malondialdehyde (MDA), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels in the CP + CUR-PP groups were lower than those in the CP group (p < 0.05). However, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduced glutathione (GSH) parameters were higher in the CP + CUR-PP groups compared to the CP group (p < 0.05). It is thought that the similarity of Groups 5 and 6 with Group 4 in Aβ1-42, pTAU, GLU, and GABA parameters hinder the determination of treatment protection however, they might have a therapeutic effect if the applied dose or study duration were changed. This study attempted to evaluate the effects of a CUR-PP combination on CP-induced brain damage in rats by measuring biochemical parameters and performing histopathological examinations. Based on the findings, this CUR-PP combination could be considered an alternative medicine option in cases with conditions similar to those evaluated in this study.",

Innovative therapeutic approaches are needed due to antibiotic resistance concerns and treatment limitations. METHODS: We synthesized and analyzed piperine-coated zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-PIP NPs) using UV spectroscopy, SEM, XRD, FTIR, and EDAX. Antioxidant and antimicrobial effectiveness were evaluated through DPPH, ABTS, and MIC assays, while the anticancer properties were assessed on KB oral squamous carcinoma cells. RESULTS: ZnO-PIP NPs exhibited significant antioxidant activity and a MIC of 50 µg/mL against dental pathogens, indicating strong antimicrobial properties. Interaction analysis revealed high binding affinity with dental pathogens. ZnO-PIP NPs showed dose-dependent anticancer activity on KB cells, upregulating apoptotic genes BCL2, BAX, and P53. CONCLUSIONS: This approach offers a multifaceted solution to combatting both oral infections and cancer, showcasing their potential for significant advancement in oral healthcare. It is essential to acknowledge potential limitations and challenges associated with the use of ZnO NPs in clinical applications. These may include concerns regarding nanoparticle toxicity, biocompatibility, and long-term safety. Further research and rigorous testing are warranted to address these issues and ensure the safe and effective translation of ZnO-PIP NPs into clinical practice.",

This study aimed to assess the effects of administrating curcumin-piperine on patients who underwent CABG surgery. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, in which 80 eligible adults who underwent CABG surgery, were randomized into 4 groups. Patients received 3 tablets daily for 5 days after the surgery, which contained curcumin-piperine (each tablet contained 500 mg curcumin +5 mg piperine) or a placebo (each tablet contained 505 mg maltodextrin). Group A received 3 placebo tablets, group B received 2 placebos and one curcumin-piperine tablet, group C received 1 placebo and 2 curcumin-piperine tablets, and group D received 3 curcumin-piperine tablets. Before and after the intervention, C-reactive protein (CRP), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), cardiometabolic factors, clinical outcomes, and 28-day mortality were evaluated. RESULTS: Between-group analysis showed that CRP significantly decreased (P = 0.028), and TAC significantly increased (P = 0.033) after the intervention (Post hoc analysis showed that for CRP, the difference was between group B and D, and for TAC was between group C and D). Between-group analysis also showed that creatine kinase mono-phosphate (CK-MB) marginally reduced (P = 0.077); however, changes for troponin I (P = 0.692), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = 0.668), ejection fraction (P = 0.340), and arterial fibrillation (P = 0.99) were not significant. Blood urea nitrogen (P = 0.820) and serum creatinine (P = 0.244) did not show notable changes between groups. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with curcumin-piperine had a promising effect on serum CRP and TAC. It also had a favorable impact on CK-MB among patients who underwent CABG surgery.

      "abstract": "Docetaxel (DTX) resistance poses a significant challenge in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa), often leading to chemotherapy failure. This study investigates the ability of piperine, a compound derived from black pepper, to enhance the sensitivity of PCa cells to DTX and elucidates its underlying mechanism. We established a DTX-resistant PCa cell line, DU145/DTX, to conduct our experiments. Through a series of assays, including MTT for cell viability, flow cytometry for apoptosis, Transwell for cell migration and invasion, and western blot for protein expression analysis, we assessed the effects of piperine on these cellular functions and on the Notch signaling pathway components. Our results demonstrated that we successfully established the DTX-resistant PCa cell line DU145/DTX. Piperine effectively decreased the viability of both DU145 and its DTX-resistant counterpart, DU145/DTX, in a concentration and time-dependent manner when used alone and in combination with DTX. Notably, piperine also induced apoptosis and reduced the migration and invasion capabilities of these cells. At the molecular level, piperine down-regulated the Notch pathway by inhibiting Notch1 and Jagged1 signaling, as well as reducing the expression of downstream effectors Hey1 and hes family bHLH transcription factor 1. The study concludes that piperine's ability to modulate the Notch signaling pathway and induce apoptosis highlights its potential as a complementary treatment for DTX-resistant PCa, paving the way for the use of traditional Chinese medicinal compounds in modern oncology treatment strategies.",

This review was done to identify potential herbal remedies that may help improve glycemic parameters, leading to better health outcomes in combination with current antidiabetic treatment. METHODOLOGY: This systematic review was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). It was conducted in 2023 with sources and databases from MEDLINE, EBSCO-Host, ScienceDirect and ProQuest. This paper included randomized-controlled trials exploring the effects of the combination of curcumin and piperine on patients with prediabetes and T2DM. Systematic reviews, observational studies, case reports, case series, conference abstracts, book sections, commentaries/editorials, non-human studies and articles with unavailable full-text and written in non-English language, were excluded. The key terms for the literature search were \"curcumin,\" \"piperine,\" \"prediabetes\" and \"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.\" We use Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2 for quality assessment of the included studies and Review Manager (RevMan) 5.4 to do the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of three studies were included in this systematic review. Two studies from Neta et al., and Cicero et al., showed no significant difference in HOMA-IR, BMI and FPG levels between the curcumin, piperine and placebo groups. One study from Panahi et al. demonstrated a significant difference in BMI levels between the curcumin and piperine and placebo groups (p <0.01). The meta-analysis showed that FPG levels, HOMA-IR and BMI improved among patients with diabetes given in curcumin and piperine with reported mean differences (MD) of = -7.61, 95% CI [-15.26, 0.03], p = 0.05, MD = -0.36, 95% CI [-0.77 to 0.05], p = 0.09, and MD = -0.41, 95% CI [-0.85 to 0.03], p = 0.07, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The supplementation of curcumin and piperine showed a numerical reduction in FPG, HOMA-IR and BMI, but were not statistically significant. Further research is needed as there is a paucity of studies included in the review.",

This triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to investigate the effects of a curcuminoids on oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in girls with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and dysmenorrhea. Eighty young girls with both PMS and dysmenorrhea were randomly given either curcuminoids (500 mg+5 mg piperine) or a placebo daily, for a period from 7 days pre- until 3 days post- initiation of menstrual bleeding for 3 successive menstrual cycles. The total antioxidant capacity and free radical scavenging activity of serum and urine were quantified via ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods, respectively. There were no significant differences between the placebo and curcumin groups, with respect to the age, dietary intake and biochemical/anthropometric indices (p>0.05). The curcumin treatment significantly increased the free-radical scavenging activity of serum compared to the treatment with placebo (p=0.031). Although, no significant changes were found in serum and urinary levels of FRAP, DPPH and MDA between the groups (p>0.05). Curcumin treatment did increase free-radical scavenging activity and antioxidant potential in girls with PMS and dysmenorrhea. Investigations with higher doses and duration of curcumin are required to verify our findings."

Piperine, a substance naturally contained in pepper, has been known for its effect on increasing curcumin bioavailability. To investigate the analgesic potential of curcumin and piperine addition to curcumin patch used as adjuvant therapy in the management of acute postoperative orofacial pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This pragmatic trial recruited 75 patients that underwent oromaxillofacial surgery at Unpad Dental Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia. Research participants were randomly assigned to three different groups: the first group that did not receive any intervention other than the post-operative standard treatment (POST), the second group that received POST and non-piperine curcumin patch, and the third group that received POST and piperine-combined curcumin patch. Participants' pain intensity was evaluated by using the face, leg, activity, cry, and consolability (FLACC) pain scale and salivary prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) level for two-time points, which were eight hours apart. All data were gathered and analyzed to compare the within and between-group differences. RESULTS: Within groups comparison of the FLACC scores for two evaluation points showed significant differences for all groups (p < 0.01). For salivary PGE2 analysis, a comparison of the non-piperine group to the piperine group also showed significant results. Yet, when all three groups were compared, regardless of the differences, the results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Despite of the proven efficacy of curcumin patch, the addition of piperine to the curcumin patch in the current study did not provide any significant effects. Further investigation is of importance."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of the majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients occurs at intermediate to advanced stages, with a few curative therapeutic options being available. It is therefore strongly urgent to discover additional adjuvant therapy for this lethal malignancy. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of curcumin (C), piperine (P) and taurine (T) combination as adjuvant agents on serum levels of IFN-γ, immunophenotypic and molecular characterization of mononuclear leukocytes (MNLs) in HCC patients treated with Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum and MNLs were collected from 20 TACE-treated HCC patients before (baseline-control samples) and after treatment with 5 g curcumin capsules , 10 mg piperine and 0.5 mg taurine taken daily for three consecutive months. Immunophenotypic and molecular characterization of MNLs were determined by flow cytometry and quantitative real time PCR, respectively. In addition, serum IFN-γ level was quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: After receiving treatment with CPT combination, there was a highly significant increase in IFN- γ levels in the sera of patients when compared to basal line control samples. Additionally, the group receiving combined therapy demonstrated a downregulation in the expression levels of PD-1, in MNLs as compared to controls. MNLs' immunophenotyping revealed a significant decline in CD4+CD25+cells (regulatory T lymphocytes). Furthermore, clinicopathological characteristics revealed a highly significant impact of CPT combination on aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alpha feto protein (AFP) levels. CONCLUSION: This study introduces a promising adjuvant CPT combined treatment as natural agents to enhance the management of HCC patients who are candidates to TACE treatment.",

      "abstract": "Piperine has been shown to bind to myosin and shift the distribution of conformational states of myosin molecules from the super-relaxed state to the disordered relaxed state. However, little is known about the implications for muscle force production and potential underlying mechanisms. Muscle contractility experiments were performed using isolated muscles and single fibres from rats and mice. The dose-response effect of piperine on muscle force was assessed at several stimulation frequencies. The potentiation of muscle force was also tested in muscles fatigued by eccentric contractions. Potential mechanisms of force potentiation were assessed by measuring Ca2+ levels during stimulation in enzymatically dissociated muscle fibres, while myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity was assessed in chemically skinned muscle fibres. Piperine caused a dose-dependent increase in low-frequency force with no effect on high-frequency force in both slow- and fast-twitch muscle, with similar relative increases in twitch force, rate of force development and relaxation rate. The potentiating effect of piperine on low-frequency force was reversible, and piperine partially recovered low-frequency force in fatigued muscle. Piperine had no effect on myoplasmic free [Ca2+] levels in mouse muscle fibres, whereas piperine substantially augmented the force response to submaximal levels of [Ca2+] in rat MyHCII fibres and MyHCI fibres along with a minor increase in maximum Ca2+-activated force. Piperine enhances low-frequency force production in both fast- and slow-twitch muscle. The effects are reversible and can counteract muscle fatigue. The primary underlying mechanism appears to be an increase in Ca2+ sensitivity. KEY POINTS: Piperine is a plant alkaloid derived from black pepper. It is known to bind to skeletal muscle myosin and enhance resting ATP turnover but its effects on contractility are not well known. We showed for the first time a piperine-induced force potentiation that was pronounced during low-frequency electrical stimulation of isolated muscles. The effect of piperine was observed in both slow and fast muscle types, was reversible, and could counteract the force decrements observed after fatiguing muscle contractions. Piperine treatment caused an increase in myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity in chemically skinned muscle fibres, while we observed no effect on intracellular Ca2+ concentrations during electrical stimulation in enzymatically dissociated muscle fibres.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Artemisinin combination therapies, the first-line antimalarials in Nigeria, have reportedly suffered multiple failures in malaria treatment, hence the search for novel combination of other compounds. Methyl gallate and palmatine have been reported to exhibit antiplasmodial activities but the antimalarial activity of their combination has not been evaluated. Therefore, the evaluation of the combination of methyl gallate and palmatine for antimalarial activity in vitro and in vivo in the presence of piperine was carried out. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibitory potential of methyl gallate and palmatine combination on β-hematin (hemozoin) formation was studied in vitro. Also, the antimalarial activity of methyl gallate and palmatine combination with/without a bioenhancer (piperine) was evaluated in Plasmodium berghei NK65-infected mice. RESULTS: Methyl gallate and palmatine in the ratio 3:2 acted synergistically in vitro and had the highest inhibitory effect (IC50 = 0.73 µg/mL) on β-hematin (hemozoin) formation. The 3:2 combination of methyl gallate and palmatine exhibited no antimalarial activity in vivo in the absence of piperine but caused reduction in parasitemia that exceeded 40% in the presence of piperine at the dose of 25 mg/kg body weight on days 6 and 8 post-inoculation in mice. CONCLUSION: The 3:2 combination of methyl gallate and palmatine in the presence of piperine exhibited antimalarial activity in vivo, possibly by synergistic inhibition of hemozoin formation which may cause accumulation of haem within the food vacuole of Plasmodium spp. and its death.",

Currently, most commercial bioavailable turmeric extracts use synthetic excipients or the addition of piperine to enhance bioavailability, and are needed in multiple daily doses to achieve clinical efficacy. This study was conducted to compare the bioavailability of a natural, water-dispersible turmeric extract containing 60% natural curcuminoids, the test product, WDTE60N (1 × 250 mg per day), with the reference product, turmeric extract capsules (500 mg curcuminoids and 5 mg piperine, CPC; 3 × 500 mg per day). METHODS: Sixteen healthy adult male subjects fasted overnight for 10 hours and then were dosed with either one capsule of the test product WDTE60N or three capsules of reference product CPC orally (One capsule administered at every 6 hours interval i.e. at 0.00 hrs, 6.00 hrs and at 12.00 hrs) in each study period. Blood sampling before and after dosing was carried out at defined time points at -12.00, -02.00, 00.00 (within 10 minutes prior to dosing) hours in morning before dosing and post-dose (First dose) at 00.50, 01.00, 02.00, 03.00, 04.00, 05.00, 06.50, 07.00, 08.00, 09.00, 10.00, 11.00, 12.50, 13.00, 14.00, 16.00, 18.00, 20.00 and 24.00 hours in each period. Plasma concentration of curcuminoids was determined using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical method. RESULTS: The Cmax (GLSM) for the test product WDTE60N was observed to be 74.56 ng/mL; and same for the reference CPC was 22.75 ng/mL. AUC0-t (GLSM) for test WDTE60N was 419.00 h∙ng/mL; and for reference CPC it was 359.86 h∙ng/mL for total curcuminoids. CONCLUSION: The test formulation WDTE60N showed improved relative absorption and equivalent exposure at a 10-fold-lower dose of actives than the reference formulation CPC.",

This study mainly explored the molecular mechanism of a 308-nm excimer combined with piperine in regulating melanocyte proliferation. METHODS: Epidermal melanocytes were cultured in piperine solution, and the cells were irradiated by an XTRAC excimer laser treatment system at 308-nm output monochromatic light. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were for detecting the expression levels of genes or proteins. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Transwell method was for assessing cell viability and migration capacity. The content of melanin was also detected. RESULTS: The combination of the 308-nm excimer laser and piperine enhanced the cell proliferation, migration, and melanin production of melanocytes and upregulated the level of miR-328, and restraint of miR-328 reversed the influence of the 308-nm excimer laser and piperine. Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) is a direct target gene of miR-328, and miR-328 can inhibit the expression of SFRP1 and elevate the protein level of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The 308-nm excimer laser combined with piperine may be more efficient than piperine alone in the remedy of vitiligo, and the miR-328/SFRP1 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways are participated in the proliferation, migration, and melanin synthesis of melanocytes.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibits high mortality rates in the advanced stage (>90 %). Sorafenib (SORA) is a targeted therapy approved for the treatment of advanced HCC; however, the reported response rate to such a therapeutic is suboptimal (<3%). Piperine (PIP) is an alkaloid demonstrated to exert a direct tumoricidal activity in HCC and improve the pharmacokinetic profiles of anticancer drugs including SORA. In this study, we developed a strategy to improve efficacy outcomes in HCC using PIP as an add-on treatment to support the first-line therapy SORA using biodegradable Poly (D, L-Lactide-co-glycolide, PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs). SORA and PIP (both exhibit low aqueous solubility) were co-loaded into PLGA NPs (PNPs) and stabilized with various concentrations of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The SORA and PIP-loaded PNPs (SP-PNPs) were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Release of these drugs from SP-PNPs was investigated in vitro at both physiological and acidic pH, and kinetic models were employed to assess the mechanism of drug release. The in vitro efficacy of SP-PNPs against HCC cells (HepG2) was also evaluated. FTIR and XRD analyses revealed that the drugs encapsulated in PNPs were in an amorphous state, with no observed chemical interactions among the drugs or excipients. Assessment of drug release in vitro at pH 5 and 7.4 showed that SORA and PIP loaded in PNPs with 0.5 % PVA were released in a sustained manner, unlike pure drugs, which exhibited relatively fast release. SP-PNPs with 0.5 % PVA were spherical, had an average size of 224 nm, and had a high encapsulation efficiency (SORA ∼ 82 %, PIP ∼ 79 %), as well as superior cytotoxicity compared to SORA monotherapy in vitro. These results suggest that combining PIP with SORA using PNPs may be an effective strategy for the treatment of HCC and may set the stage for a comprehensive in vivo study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this novel formulation using a murine HCC model."

The costs and the side effects of current treatments render imperative the development of new therapies that are affordable and easy to administer. Topical treatment would be the ideal option for the treatment of CL. This underscores the urgent need for affordable and effective treatments, with natural compounds being explored as potential solutions. The alkaloid piperine (PIP), the polyphenol curcumin (CUR), and the flavonoid quercetin (QUE), known for their diverse biological properties, are promising candidates to address these parasitic diseases. Initially, the in vitro cytotoxicity activity of the compounds was evaluated using U-937 cells, followed by the assessment of the leishmanicidal activity of these compounds against amastigotes of L. braziliensis. Subsequently, a golden hamster model with stationary-phase L. braziliensis promastigote infections was employed. Once the ulcer appeared, hamsters were treated with QUE, PIP, or CUR formulations and compared to the control group treated with meglumine antimoniate administered intralesionally. We observed that the three organic compounds showed high in vitro leishmanicidal activity with effective concentrations of less than 50 mM, with PIP having the highest activity at a concentration of 8 mM. None of the compounds showed cytotoxic activity for U937 macrophages with values between 500 and 700 mM. In vivo, topical treatment with QUE daily for 15 days produced cured in 100% of hamsters while the effectiveness of CUR and PIP was 83% and 67%, respectively. No failures were observed with QUE. Collectively, our data suggest that topical formulations mainly for QUE but also for CUR and PIP could be a promising topical treatment for CL. Not only the ease of obtaining or synthesizing the organic compounds evaluated in this work but also their commercial availability eliminates one of the most important barriers or bottlenecks in drug development, thus facilitating the roadmap for the development of a topical drug for the management of CL caused by L. braziliensis.",

Piperine was successfully loaded on CLNPs prepared using chitosan, stearic acid, Tween 80 and Tripolyphosphate (TPP) at different concentrations. The developed CLNPs exhibited high entrapment efficiency that ranged from 85.12 to 97.41%, a particle size in the range of 59.56-414 nm and a negatively charged zeta potential values (- 20.1 to - 43.9 mV). In vitro release study revealed enhanced PP release from CLNPs compared to that from free PP suspensions for up to 24 h. In vivo studies revealed that treatment with the optimized PP-CLNPs formulation (F2) exerted a cognitive enhancing effect and ameliorated the oxidative stress associated with diabetes. PP-CLNPs acted as an effective bio-enhancer which increased the potency of metformin in protecting brain tissue from diabetes-induced neuroinflammation and memory deterioration. These results suggested that CLNPs could be a promising drug delivery system for encapsulating PP and thus can be used as an adjuvant therapy in the management of high-risk diabetic cognitive impairment conditions.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which has a high risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Piperine (Pip) is an extract of plants with powerful anti-inflammatory effects, however, the function of Pip in NASH remains elusive. Here, we aim to explore the role of Pip in NASH and to find the possible mechanisms. METHODS: Methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diets were used to induce steatohepatitis, methionine- and choline-sufficient (MCS) diets were used as the control. After Pip treatment, H&E staining, Oil Red O staining, hepatic triglyceride (TG) content and F4/80 expression were performed to analysis liver steatosis and inflammation; Masson's staining, COL1A1 and α-SMA were detected liver fibrosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -treated AML12 cells were used to as the cell model to induce pyroptosis. Then, pyroptosis-related proteins, IL-1β and LDH release were detected in vivo and in vitro. Finally, NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082, was used to further demonstrate the mechanism of Pip in NASH. RESULTS: The study found that Pip alleviated liver steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte injury, and fibrosis in mice fed with MCD diets. Moreover, the pyroptosis markers (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 p20, and GSDMD), IL-1β and LDH release were decreased by Pip treatment. NF-κB activation was suppressed by Pip treatment and pyroptosis-related proteins were down regulated by BAY11-7082. CONCLUSION: Pip ameliorates NASH progression, and the therapeutical effect was associated with inhibition of hepatocyte pyroptosis induced by NF-κB.",

      "abstract": "AkT1, significantly impacts many tumours cell functions, like transcription, apoptosis, glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell migration. For tumours to develop and spread, aberrant activation of AKT1 is essential. Therefore, a major focus of molecularly targeted PCa treatment is AKT1. The present study investigates the effect of piperine compared to SDF using in-vitro studies, viz colony formation assay, comet assay and AKT1 gene expression studies using human PCa cell line PC3. A cluster of approximately at least 50 cells constitutes a colony. The clonogenic assay showed that the number and size of colonies significantly decreased when treated with compounds (SDF and piperine) in comparison to the untreated cells which effectively proliferated to form more colonies. Piperine treatment showed significant inhibition of colony formation than SDF. Effective genotoxicity was observed in piperine-treated PC3 cells with an increased Tail length of 120 µm and it was moderately observed in SDF with a Tail length of 30 µm treated on PC3 cells. The control group did not show any considerable genotoxicity with a Tail length of 6 µm. Our data, both in vitro and in silico, suggested that piperine would be a good starting point for developing novel drugs for the treatment of PCa. The downstream functions of Akt1 may be inhibited by these effects, which could impede the proliferation of PCa cells. High stability of the piperine-AKT1 complex was found by the MD simulation. Higher hydrophilic residues like Lys268 and Ser205 at the active pocket may be the cause of the binding stability. Overall, the observed results confirmed the anti-PCa effect of piperine by causing effective DNA damage and proved to be genotoxic in nature against the human PCa. These effects may impede the downstream activities of Akt1 and result in PCa cell growth regression."

Piperine (PIP) is an alkaloid that has antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. This study was investigated the protective effects of PIP on CP-induced testicular toxicity in the mice. In this experimental study, 48 adult male BALB/c mice (30-35 g) were divided into six groups (n = 8), receiving normal saline (C), 5 mg/kg of PIP (PIP5), 10 mg/kg of PIP (PIP10), 200 mg/kg of CP, 200 mg/kg of CP + PIP5, and 200 mg/kg of CP + PIP10. On the eighth day of the study, blood and testis samples were prepared for serum testosterone hormone quantification, sperm analysis, histological, and immunohistochemical assays. The results of this study showed that CP induced testicular toxicity with the decrease of sperm count, motility, and viability. Also, CP treatment caused histological structure alterations in the testis, including exfoliation, degeneration, vacuolation of spermatogenic cells, and reducing the thickness of the epithelium and the diameter of the seminiferous tubule. In addition, CP decreased glutathione (GSH) levels, increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, Caspase-3, and NF-κB. At the same time, PIP treatment reduced testicular histopathological abnormalities, oxidative stress, and apoptosis that were induced by CP. These results showed that PIP improved CP-induced testicular toxicity in mice, which can be related to its antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities.",

We observed that treatment with piperine for 3 weeks significantly reduced serum uric acid levels and reversed kidney function impairment in mice with HN. Piperine (5 μM) alleviated uric acid-induced damage in mRTECs. Moreover, piperine inhibited transporter expression and dose-dependently inhibited the activity of both transporters. The results revealed that piperine regulated the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway both in vivo and in vitro.

However, the role of piperine in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the mice were administered piperine (30 mg/kg) intragastric administration before surgery. After 24 h of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion, liver histopathological evaluation, serum transaminase measurements, and TUNEL analysis were performed. The infiltration of inflammatory cells and production of inflammatory mediators in the liver tissue were determined by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. The protein levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and related proteins such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), p65, and p38 were detected by western blotting. The results showed that plasma aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hepatocyte apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cell infiltration significantly increased in HIRI mice. Piperine pretreatment notably repaired liver function, improved the histopathology and apoptosis of liver cells, alleviated oxidative stress injury, and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. Further analysis showed that piperine attenuated tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) production and reduced TLR4 activation and phosphorylation of IRAK1, p38, and NF-κB in HIRI. Piperine has a protective effect against HIRI through the TLR4/IRAK1/NF-κB signaling pathway and may be a safer option for future clinical treatment and prevention of ischemia-related diseases.",

It plays a crucial role in human health leading to understanding the dynamic crosstalk of host-microbe interaction in the gut and has become necessary for the detection, prevention, or therapy of diseases. Gut microbiota deviations are linked with many diseases, suggesting that various pathways involved in immunity, energy, lipid, and glucose metabolism are affected. Further, it is also altered by external insults such as metal toxicity, antibiotics and pesticides. Heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, cadmium and chromium are some of the well-studied classes of environmental pollutants. Mouse models have become the model of choice for most studies in this emerging field, as they allow perturbations in the gut microbiota to be studied in a controlled experimental setup. Here, we investigate the composition and diversity of intestinal microbes utilizing cecal samples from different intervention groups: arsenic exposure (As(III)), arsenic and piperine co-administration (As +Pp), piperine per se and control group. We obtained DNA samples from these groups and performed PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S V3-V4 region. The findings showed shift in microbial composition and abundance among different intervention groups, revealing taxa that may contribute to the microbial diversity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Piperine, a naturally occurring compound in black pepper (Piper nigrum), is known for its potential health benefits, including its reported enhancement of insulin sensitivity. However, the precise impact of piperine on hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1α) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), transcription factors for insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in hepatocytes, remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effect of piperine, compared to metformin, on blood glucose and insulin levels by modifying the expression of hepatic HNF-1α and SREBP-1c in high-fat-diet (HFD) and sucrose-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats and in human Chang liver cells. METHODS: Adult male albino rats were categorized into four groups: group 1 as the control, group 2 as T2DM, group 3 as T2DM rats treated with piperine (40 mg), and group 4 as T2DM rats treated with metformin (50 mg). Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and serum insulin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was conducted to assess the mRNA expression of HNF-1α and SREBP-1c. Further, piperine was treated with normal and high glucose-induced Chang liver cells, and gene expression was analysed. Data analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with a significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: Treatment with piperine led to a notable decrease in blood glucose levels and circulating insulin when compared with T2DM rats (group 2). Additionally, piperine administration resulted in the upregulation of HNF-1α mRNA expression and downregulation of SREBP-1c mRNA levels whose effects were found to be near that of the control and standard drug metformin's effects. In vitro study also confirmed that piperine improved the HNF-1α expression and reduced the expression of SREBP-1c in Chang liver cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that piperine treatment effectively regulates hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic insulin resistance in the liver by modulating the expression of HNF-1α and SREBP-1c. Consequently, piperine emerges as a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention in managing T2DM."

OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the clinical and RCM features of re-pigmentation with combined narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) and piperine-based topical treatment in localized vitiligo. METHODS: Eight patients enrolled at a single center received combined treatment: topical treatment was applied twice daily + NB-UVB twice weekly for 2 × 2-month periods. Clinical changes were analyzed by the Vitiligo Noticeability Scale (VNS) and percentage of re-pigmentation. The evaluator agreement was assessed. Predefined RCM features had the presence/absence of (i) blood vessels, (ii) dendritic cells, and the quantity of (i) an irregular honeycombed pattern and (ii) non-pigmented papillae. Clinical and RCM monitoring was performed at the baseline, 2, 3, 5, and 7 months. RESULTS: Macules were \"slightly less noticeable\" with 25-50% re-pigmentation. Irregular honeycomb patterns and non-pigmented papillae were significantly less frequently observed, and in less extended areas (T1 vs. T2, p = 0.039; T0 vs. T1, p = 0.005 and T2 vs. T4, p = 0.033). Dendritic cells and blood vessels improved, with significant changes in blood vessels (T1 vs. T2, p = 0.005 and T3 vs. T4, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: RCM confirms the morphological changes induced by combined treatment for localized vitiligo."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Candidiasis is the common name for diseases caused by yeast of the genus Candida. Candida albicans is one of the most implicated species in superficial and invasive candidiasis. Antifungals, polyenes, and azoles have been used to treat candidiasis. However, due to the development of antifungal resistance, research of natural substances with potential antifungal effects at low concentrations or combined is also a possibility. METHODS: The broth microdilution method was used to evaluate the antifungal activity. The biofilm formation was assessed using the microtiter plate method. The antibiofilm activities were assessed using micro plaque tetrazolium salt assay (MTT). The combination effect of antifungal with natural substances was made using the checkerboard method. RESULTS: Among our isolates, clotrimazole was the most resistant, but amphotericin B was the most effective antifungal. The biofilm was formed by all isolates of C. albicans. Curcumin and piperine displayed antibiofilm activity with minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) and minimum eradicating concentration (MBEC) ranging from 64 to 1024 μg/mL and 256 to 2048 μg/mL. In combination, piperine presented double synergistic effects compared to curcumin with all antifungals tested. Curcumin shows more synergistic effect when combined with polyenes than with azoles. However, piperine shows a more synergistic effect when combined with azoles compared to polyenes. CONCLUSION: C. albicans was susceptible to curcumin and piperine both on planktonic cells and biofilm. The combination of curcumin and piperine with antifungals has shown synergistic effects against multiresistant clinical isolates of Candida albicans representing an alternative drug research for the treatment of clinical candidiasis."

Piperine contains various bioactive effects, such as antibacterial activity, in addition to several physiological benefits that could help overall human health, such as immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, antimetastatic, anticancer, and many more properties that have been established. Clinical trials revealed that this phytochemical has exceptional antioxidant, anticancer, and drug availability-enhancing properties, as well as immunomodulatory potential. The different components of evidence indicate the therapeutic potential of piperine and underscore the importance of incorporating it into both broad health-promoting interventions and supplementary treatment pharmaceutical formulations. This inclusion can enhance the bioavailability of other therapeutic medications, including those used in chemotherapy."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract and is characterized by immune dysregulation. Oral administration of nanoformulations containing immunomodulators is a desirable approach to treating UC. However, low drug-loading (<10%, typically), premature drug release, and systemic absorption of these nanoformulations continue to be significant challenges restricting clinical applications. Herein, we developed colon-targeted piperine-glycyrrhizic acid nanocrystals (ES100-PIP/GA NCs) to treat UC through the regulation of macrophages. The ES100-PIP/GA NCs exhibited ultra-high drug loading and colon-specific drug release. In vitro studies demonstrated that the ES100-PIP/GA NCs could effectively be internalized by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 and Caco-2 cells. More importantly, the ES100-PIP/GA NCs could downregulate pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-17A), upregulate anti-inflammatory factors (TGF-β1), and repair the intestinal mucosal barrier. In a murine model of acute colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), ES100-PIP/GA NCs could protect PIP and GA from gastric acid destruction, reach the colon, and significantly inhibit colitis. Surprisingly, ES100-PIP/GA NCs enhance M2 macrophages by increasing the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and inhibit M1 macrophages by reducing hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Overall, this study shows that ES100-PIP/GA NCs have synergistic immunotherapy capabilities with macrophage regulation, which offers a promising blueprint for the oral delivery of multicomponent drugs in UC therapy.",

Studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of natural compounds in cancer treatment and prevention, either in isolation or in conjunction with chemotherapy. In order to improve Tamoxifen's therapeutic efficacy in in-vivo studies, our research sought to determine the effects of hesperidin, piperine, and bee venom as natural compounds, as well as their combination effect with or without Tamoxifen. First, 132 female albino rats were equally divided into six groups and five subgroups, and breast cancer was induced in the selected groups by xenografting of MCF7 cells. Second, the effect of single and best ratio combinations treatment from previous in vitro studies were selected. Next, tumorous mammary glands were collected for apoptotic and antiapoptotic biomarkers and cell cycle analysis. Single or combined natural products with or without Tamoxifen revealed a significant up-regulation in apoptotic genes Bax and Casp3 and a downregulation of antiapoptotic and angiogenesis genes Bcl-2 and VEGF genes. We found that cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase was exclusively caused by Tamoxifen and/ or hesperidin. However, the cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase is a result of the combination of piperine and bee venom, with or without Tamoxifen by using the flow cytometric technique. Our research concludes that bee venom, hesperidin, and piperine can synergistically enhance to increase Tamoxifen's efficiency in the management of breast cancer.",

Piperine, the bio-active ingredient of black pepper, can exert a significant function in treatment of individuals with NAFLDand early cirrhosis. We investigated the impact of piperine consumption with a duration of 12 weeks on patients with NAFLD and early cirrhosis compared toplacebo consumption. In a double-blind study, patients with NAFLD and early stage of cirrhosis were haphazardly distributed into case and control groups. They were prescribed a placebo and 5 mg of piperine for 12 weeks, respectively. The demographic and laboratory parameters of individuals were assessed as the baseline and after the duration of piperine intake. Piperine with a daily dosage of 5 mg could significantly decrease hepatic enzymes and glucose, and alleviate dyslipidemia in the case arm rather than the control arm. Moreover, HOMA levels and insulin resistance were reduced in case participants compared to the control counterparts. In the absence of approved medicinal intervention for patients with NAFLD, and regarding the favorable impact of piperine on NAFLD more studies on this subject are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress caused by light and high temperature arises during in vitro maturation (IVM), resulting in low-quality embryos compared with those obtained in vivo. To overcome this problem, we investigated the influence of piperine (PIP) treatment during maturation of porcine oocytes on subsequent embryo development in vitro. Porcine oocytes were cultured in IVM medium supplemented with 0, 50, 100, 200, or 400 μM PIP. After parthenogenetic activation, the blastocyst (BL) formation was significantly higher and the apoptosis rate was significantly lower using 200 μM PIP-treated oocytes (200 PIP). In the 200 PIP group, the level of reactive oxygen species at the metaphase II stage was decreased, accompanied by an increased level of glutathione and increased expression of antioxidant processes (Nrf2, CAT, HO-1, SOD1, and SOD2). Consistently, chromosome misalignment and aberrant spindle organization were alleviated and phosphorylated p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was increased in the 200 PIP group. Expression of development-related (CDX2, NANOG, POU5F1, and SOX2), anti-apoptotic (BCL2L1 and BIRC5), and pro-apoptotic (BAK, FAS, and CASP3) processes was altered in the 200 PIP group. Ultimately, embryo development was improved in the 200 PIP group following somatic cell nuclear transfer. These findings suggest that PIP improves the quality of porcine oocytes by reducing oxidative stress, which inevitably arises via IVM. In-depth mechanistic studies of porcine oocytes will improve the efficiencies of assisted reproductive technologies.",

      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive disease with rapid progression and poor prognosis due to multidrug resistance (MDR). Piperine (PIP) shows promise as a P-gp inhibitor, capable of sensitizing chemotherapeutic drugs and exhibiting antitumor properties. This study explores the inhibitory mechanism of PIP on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and its capacity to enhance the sensitivity of paclitaxel (PTX). We subsequently evaluated the efficacy and safety of albumin nanoparticles that co-encapsulate PTX and PIP (PP@AN). The results demonstrated that PIP enhanced the accumulation of PTX intracellularly, as determined with HPLC/MS/MS analysis. PIP was also found to increase cell sensitivity to PTX. Furthermore, we explored the inhibitory mechanism of PIP on P-gp, utilizing molecular docking simulations, RT-qPCR, and Western blot analysis. PIP appears to compete with the active paclitaxel binding site on P-gp, affecting ATPase activity and downregulating the MDR1 gene and P-gp expression. In summary, PIP could inhibit P-gp and act as a sensitizer in the treatment of TNBC with PTX. Moreover, stable and uniform PP@AN was successfully formulated, resulting in a significant increase in drug accumulation within cells as well as the downregulation of P-gp in tumors at the optimal ratio (PTX:PIP = 1:2). This led to an improvement in the antitumor effect in vivo while also reducing hepatotoxicity and hemototoxicity following chemotherapy. This study comprehensively investigated PIP's inhibitory effect and mechanism on P-gp. We present a new approach for co-delivering PIP and PTX using albumin nanoparticles, which reduced toxicity and improved therapeutic efficacy both in vivo and in vitro."

Furthermore, the mechanisms of action of piperine and its impact on virulence factors in Candida albicans, which have not been comprehensively understood, were also assessed. Initially, piperine suppressed the hyphal transition in both liquid and solid media, hindered biofilm formation, and resulted in observable cell distortions in scanning electron microscope (SEM) samples, for both fluconazole-sensitive and fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains. Additionally, the morphogenetic switches triggered by piperine were found to rely on the activity of mutant C. albicans strains. Secondly, piperine treatment increased cell membrane permeability and disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, as evidenced by propidium iodine and Rhodamine 123 staining, respectively. Moreover, it induced the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species in C. albicans. Synergy was obtained between the piperine and the fluconazole against the fluconazole-sensitive strain. Interestingly, there were no hemolytic effects of piperine, and it resulted in reduced cytotoxicity on fibroblast cells at low concentrations. The results suggest that piperine could have a dual mode of action inhibiting virulence factors and modulating cellular processes, leading to cell death in C. albicans.",

However, no specific or effective therapy has been identified for this complication. Piperine is an alkaloid known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties, which are important characteristics for treatment of SAE. The objective of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of piperine on SAE in C57BL/6 mice that underwent cecum ligation and perforation surgery (CLP). MAIN METHODS: C57BL/6 male mice were randomly assigned to groups that underwent SHAM surgery or CLP. Mice in the CLP group were treated with piperine at doses of 20 or 40 mg/kg for short- (5 days) or long-term (10 days) periods after CLP. KEY FINDINGS: Our results revealed that untreated septic animals exhibited increased concentrations of IL-6, TNF, VEGF, MMP-9, TBARS, and NLRP3, and decreased levels of BDNF, sulfhydryl groups, and catalase in the short term. Additionally, the levels of carbonylated proteins and degenerated neuronal cells were increased at both time points. Furthermore, short-term and visuospatial memories were impaired. Piperine treatment reduced MMP-9 activity in the short term and decreased the levels of carbonylated proteins and degenerated neuronal cells in the long term. It also lowered IL-6 and TBARS levels at both time points evaluated. Moreover, piperine increased short-term catalase and long-term BDNF factor levels and improved memory at both time points. SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, our data demonstrate that piperine exerts a neuroprotective effect on SAE in animals that have undergone CLP.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of supplementation with curcumin-piperine combination in patients with ischemic stroke in the rehabilitation stage. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 66 patients with stroke were randomized into two groups receiving curcumin-piperine tablets (500 mg curcumin + 5 mg piperine) and matched placebo tablets for 12 weeks. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), thrombosis, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), lipid profile, anthropometric indices, blood pressure, and quality of life were assessed before and after the intervention. Statistical data analysis was done using SPSS22 software. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients with a mean age of 59.80 ± 4.25 years completed the trial. Based on ANCOVA test, adjusted for baseline values, curcumin-piperine supplementation for 12 weeks resulted in significant reductions in serum levels of hs-CRP (p = 0.026), total cholesterol (TC) (p = 0.009), triglycerides (TG) (p = 0.001), CIMT (p = 0.002), weight (P = 0.001), waist circumference (p = 0.024), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), and a significant increase in TAC (p < 0.001) in comparison to the placebo. Pain score significantly increased in both groups; however, its increase was significantly higher in the placebo group compared with the intervention group (p = 0.007). No significant changes were observed between the two groups in terms of serum fibrinogen, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and quality of life indices. CONCLUSION: Curcumin-piperine supplementation had beneficial effects on CIMT, serum hs-CRP, TC, TG, TAC, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with ischemic stroke in the rehabilitation stage.",

This study investigated the therapeutic effects of resveratrol, gallic acid, and piperine as natural anticancer agents on the HL-60 cell line and their roles in apoptosis. In this experimental study, quantitative analysis of miRs, including miR-17, miR-92b, miR-181a, and miR-222, were performed in 150 newly diagnosed patients with AML by real-time PCR assay. HL-60 cell viability as well as the expression of miRs, BAX, BCL-2, MCL-1, WT1, c-Kit, and CEBPA, were also assessed after transfection with the LNA-miRs and treatment with resveratrol, gallic acid, and piperine. The expression of miR-17 and miR-181a decreased significantly in LNA-anti-miRs. Although HL-60 cell viability decreased in LNA-anti-miR-222, miR-17, and miR-92b, blockade of miR-181a increased the cell viability. Besides, the cell viability increased merely in the piperine-treated group. Compared to untreated cells, miR-17 and miR-92b expression significantly increased in gallic acid- and resveratrol-treated cells. In HL-60 cells treated with resveratrol, gallic acid, and piperine, the expression of miR-181a was also increased significantly. The expression of BAX was also increased in resveratrol and piperine-treated groups. Compared to untreated cells, the expression of c-Kit increased significantly in the piperine-treated group; however, it decreased in the resveratrol-treated group. LNA-anti-miRs may be a promising agent for the treatment of AML. All three compounds used in this study showed anticancer effects, which can exert the desired outcome in patients with AML.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is an important hallmark of Glioblastoma (GBM) marked by elevated vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and its receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). As previously reported nimbolide (NBL), trans-chalcone (TC) and piperine (PPR) possess promising antiangiogenic activity in several cancers however, their comparative efficacy and mechanism of antiangiogenic activity in GBM against VEGFR-2 has not been elucidated. METHODS: 2D and 3D spheroids cultures of U87 (Uppsala 87 Malignant Glioma) were used for evaluation of non-cytotxoic dose for anti-angiogenic activity. The antiangiogenic effect was investigated by the GBM U87 cell line bearing chick CAM model. Excised U87 xenografts were histologically examined for blood vascular density by histochemistry. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the presence of avian and human VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 mRNA transcripts. RESULTS: Using 2D and 3D spheroid models, the non-cytotoxic dose of NBL, TC and PPR was ≤ 11 µM. We found NBL, TC and PPR inhibit U87-induced neoangiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in the CAM stand-alone model as well as in CAM U87 xenograft model. The results also indicate that these natural compounds inhibit the expression of notable angiogenic factors, VEGF-A and VEGFR-2. A positive correlation was found between blood vascular density and VEGF-A as well as VEGFR-2 transcripts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, NBL, TC and PPR can suppress U87-induced neoangiogenesis via a reduction in VEGF-A and its receptor VEGFR-2 transcript expression at noncytotoxic concentrations. These phytochemicals showed their utility as adjuvants to GBM therapy, with Piperine demonstrating superior effectiveness among them all.",

      "abstract": "Piperine (PPN) is a natural alkaloid derived from black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) and has garnered substantial attention for its potential in breast cancer therapy due to its diverse pharmacological properties. However, its highly lipophilic characteristics and poor dissolution in biological fluids limit its clinical application. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, we formulate and evaluate PPN-encapsulated polycaprolactone (PCL) nanoparticles (PPN-PCL-NPs). The nanoparticles were prepared by a single-step nanoprecipitation method and further optimized by a formulation design approach. The influence of selected independent variables PCL (X1), poloxamer 188 (P-188; X2), and stirring speed (SS; X3) were investigated on the particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI), and % encapsulation efficiency (EE). The selected optimized nanoparticles were further assessed for stability, in vitro release, and in vitro antibreast cancer activity in the MCF-7 cancer cell line. The PS, PDI, zeta potential, and % EE of the optimized PPN-PCL-NPs were observed to be 107.61 ± 5.28 nm, 0.136 ± 0.011, -20.42 ± 1.82 mV, and 79.53 ± 5.22%, respectively. The developed PPN-PCL-NPs were stable under different temperature conditions with insignificant changes in their pharmaceutical attributes. The optimized PPN-PCL-NPs showed a burst release for the first 6 h and later showed sustained release for 48 h. The PPN-PCL-NPs exhibit exceptional cytotoxic effects in MCF-7 breast tumor cells in comparison with the native PPN. Thus, the formulation of PPN-loaded PCL-NPs can be a promising approach for better therapeutic efficacy against breast cancer."

      "abstract": "Cancer, characterized by the unregulated growth and dissemination of malignantly transformed cells, presents a significant global health challenge. The multistage process of cancer development involves intricate biochemical and genetic alterations within target cells. Cancer chemoprevention has emerged as a vital strategy to address this complex issue to mitigate cancer's impact on healthcare systems. This approach leverages pharmacologically active agents to block, suppress, prevent, or reverse invasive cancer development. Among these agents, piperine, an active alkaloid with a wide range of therapeutic properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects, has garnered attention for its potential in cancer prevention and treatment. This comprehensive review explores piperine's multifaceted role in inhibiting the molecular events and signaling pathways associated with various stages of cancer development, shedding light on its promising prospects as a versatile tool in cancer chemoprevention. Furthermore, the review will also delve into how piperine enhances the effectiveness of conventional treatments such as UV-phototherapy and TRAIL-based therapy, potentially synergizing with existing therapeutic modalities to provide more robust cancer management strategies. Finally, a crucial perspective of the long-term safety and potential side effects of piperine-based therapies and the need for clinical trials is also discussed."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-homologous end joining, an important DNA-double-stranded break repair pathway, plays a prominent role in conferring resistance to radiotherapeutic agents, resulting in cancer progression and relapse. PURPOSE: The molecular players involved in the radio-sensitizing effects of piperine and many other phytocompounds remain evasive to a great extent. The study is designed to assess if piperine, a plant alkaloid can alter the radioresistance by modulating the expression of non-homologous end-joining machinery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Estrogen receptor-positive/negative, breast cancer cells were cultured to understand the synergetic effects of piperine with radiotherapy. Cisplatin and Bazedoxifene were used as positive controls. Cells were exposed to γ- radiation using Low Dose gamma Irradiator-2000. The piperine effect on Estrogen receptor modulation, DNA-Damage, DNA-Damage-Response, and apoptosis was done by western blotting, immunofluorescence, yeast-based-estrogen-receptor-LacZ-reporter assay, and nuclear translocation analysis. Micronuclei assay was done for DNA damage and genotoxicity, and DSBs were quantified by γH2AX-foci-staining using confocal microscopy. Flow cytometry analysis was done to determine the cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and Reactive oxygen species generation. Pharmacophore analysis and protein-ligand interaction studies were done using Schrodinger software. Synergy was computed by compusyn-statistical analysis. Standard errors/deviation/significance were computed with GraphPad prism. RESULTS: Using piperine, we propose a new strategy for overcoming acquired radioresistance through estrogen receptor-mediated modulation of the NHEJ pathway. This is the first comprehensive study elucidating the mechanism of radio sensitizing potential of piperine. Piperine enhanced the radiation-induced cell death and enhanced the expression and activation of Estrogen receptor β, while Estrogen receptor α expression and activation were reduced. In addition, piperine shares common pharmacophore features with most of the known estrogen agonists and antagonists. It altered the estrogen receptor α/β ratio and the expression of estrogen-responsive proteins of DDR and NHEJ pathway. Enhanced expression of DDR proteins, ATM, p53, and P-p53 with low DNA-PK repair complex (comprising of DNA-PKcs/Ku70/Ku80), resulted in the accumulation of radiation-induced DNA double-stranded breaks (as evidenced by MNi and γH2AX-foci) culminating in cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial-pathway of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study for the first time reported that piperine sensitizes breast cancer cells to radiation by accumulating DNA breaks, through altering the expression of DNA-PK Complex, and DDR proteins, via selective estrogen receptor modulation, offering a novel strategy for combating radioresistance.",

Six aspects of PPN activity were identified, including antibacterial spectrum, association with antibiotics, efflux pump inhibition, biofilm effects, protein target binding, and modulation of immune functions/virulence factors. Most studies focused on Mycobacterium spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Cell lineages and in vivo models were employed to study PPN antibacterial effects. Conclusion: We highlight PPN as a potential adjuvant in the treatment of bacterial infections.

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers around the world, with a high mortality rate. Despite substantial advancements in diagnoses and therapies, the outlook and survival of patients with lung cancer remains dismal due to drug tolerance and malignant reactions. New interventional treatments urgently need to be explored if natural compounds are to be used to reduce toxicity and adverse effects to meet the needs of lung cancer clinical treatment. An internalizing arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (iRGD) modified by a tumour-piercing peptide liposome (iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP) was developed via co-delivery of curcumin (CUR) and piperine (PIP). Its antitumour efficacy was evaluated and validated via in vivo and in vitro experiments. iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP enhanced tumour targeting and cellular internalisation effectively. In vitro, iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP exhibited enhanced cellular uptake, suppression of tumour cell multiplication and invasion and energy-independent cellular uptake. In vivo, iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP showed high antitumour efficacy, mainly in terms of significant tumour volume reduction and increased weight and spleen index. Data showed that iRGD peptide has active tumour targeting and it significantly improves the penetration and cellular internalisation of tumours in the liposomal system. The use of CUR in combination with PIP can exert synergistic antitumour activity. This study provides a targeted therapeutic system based on natural components to improve antitumour efficacy in lung cancer.",

This study aimed to investigate piperine-induced apoptosis and autophagy in HSC-3 human oral cancer cells and their effects on tumor growth in vivo. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay demonstrated that piperine reduced the viability of HSC-3 cells and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, annexin-V/propidium iodide staining, and analysis of apoptosis-related protein expression confirmed that piperine induces apoptosis in HSC-3 cells. Additionally, piperine-induced autophagy was confirmed by the observation of increased acidic vesicular organelles and autophagy marker proteins, demonstrating that autophagy in HSC-3 cells induces apoptosis. Mechanistically, piperine induced apoptosis and autophagy by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in HSC-3 cells. We also confirmed that piperine inhibits oral cancer tumor growth in vivo via antitumor effects related to apoptosis and PI3K signaling pathway inhibition. Therefore, we suggest that piperine can be considered a natural anticancer agent for human oral cancer."

This study aimed to use Pn for possible biochemical targets and to assess mechanisms of anti-leishmanial action and immunomodulatory roles. METHODS: The ability of Pn to bind to interleukin-12P40 (IL-12P40) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was investigated using molecular docking. The leishmanicidal effect of Pn, meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime®; MA), and Pn plus MA was assessed on Leishmania major promastigotes and amastigotes. A real-time PCR was applied to quantify cytokines gene expression in drug-treated murine macrophages. RESULTS: The molecular docking findings indicated that Pn could bind to IL-12P40/IFN-γ. In silico analyses showed an affinity of Pn to IL-12P40/IFN-γ, with the MolDock score of -236.91 and -64.87 kcal/mol, respectively. Pn plus MA reduced the proliferation rate of promastigote and amastigote forms of L. major compared to each drug alone (IC50 = 43.22 and 19.41 μg/mL, respectively). Moreover, the combination drug demonstrated no cytotoxicity as the selectivity index (SI) was 14.81. Also, Th1-related cytokines were upregulated, while Th2-related cytokines were downregulated in Pn combination-treated murine macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: The superior effectiveness of combination therapy on L. major warrants further investigations on the clinical potential of this combination in the treatment of leishmaniasis."

In the current study, we performed in vitro experiments and transcriptome analysis to determine the response of NaB, Cur, piperine (Pip) and their combination in two different HCC cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3B. NaB and Cur induced cytotoxicity in a dose and time dependent manner in HepG2 and Hep3B, whereas Pip showed no significant toxic effect. Synergistic effect of combined treatment with NaB, Cur and Pip on HCC cells was observed on cytotoxicity, apoptosis and cell cycle assay. Following in vitro studies, we performed RNA-seq transcriptome analysis on NaB, Cur and Pip and their combination on HepG2 and Hep3B cells.

On day 14, the animals were euthanized, and the blood was collected; biochemical analysis was performed for the measurement of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. Within the same period, nanopiperine improved hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus of mice subjected to LPS-induced stress. In addition, the neurotransmitter estimation by the HPLC method showed that nanopiperine increased the levels of neurotransmitters. In summary, the nanopiperine showed potent neuroprotective and antidepressant activity, and stability relating to the elevated level of hippocampal BDNF level and as compared to pure piperine, the nanopiperine showed better oral bioavailability and stability.",
