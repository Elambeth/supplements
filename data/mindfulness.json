      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on psychological outcomes in surgeons. METHODS: A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis (random effects modeling) was performed searching for comparative studies. Primary outcomes were stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-10) and mindfulness (Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised, CAMS-R). Secondary outcomes were burnout and anxiety (abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory [aMBI], Patient Health Questionnaire-2 [PHQ-2], and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]). RESULTS: Surgical residents numbering 179 (MBIs 98 vs. control 81) from five studies (4 RCTs and 1 cohort study) were included. At baseline, both cohorts were comparable in terms of stress (PSS-10, p = 0.420), mindfulness (CAMS-R, p = 0.620), burnout (aMBI, p = 0.980), depersonalization (p = 740), emotional exhaustion (p = 480), depression (PHQ-2, p = 0.280), and anxiety (STAI, p = 0.060). MBIs reduced stress (PSS-10; MD: -3.24, 95% CI -6.10 to -0.39, and p = 0.030), improved mindfulness (CAMS-R; MD: 3.97, 95% CI 2.57-5.37, and p < 0.00001), and reduced burnout (aMBI; MD: -1.98, 95% CI -3.57 to -0.38, and p = 0.020), depersonalization (MD: -2.80, 95% CI -5.22 to -0.38, and p = 0.020), and emotional exhaustion (MD: -3.20, 95% CI -5.48 to -0.92, and p = 0.0006). MBIs did not influence depression (PHQ-2; MD: -0.46, 95% CI -1.32 to -0.40, and p = 0.290) or anxiety (STAI; MD: -0.16, 95% CI -2.62 to -2.30, and p = 0.900). CONCLUSIONS: MBIs may improve psychological outcomes as shown by better mindfulness (high certainly), less stress (moderate certainty), and burnout (moderate certainty). Whether MBIs translate into better long-term surgical performance and patient outcomes should be the focus of future research. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024595967."

      "abstract": "This manuscript comments on the article published in a recent issue of World Journal of Psychology. We emphasize the potential of combining Epirubicin (EPI) chemotherapy with mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) to optimize cancer care for urinary system tumors. The long-term use EPI is associated with depression and in short-term has shown side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and occasional abdominal pain, which can impact patient adherence. MBIs address the psychological burdens, such as depression and anxiety, that accompany cancer treatment, enhancing emotional well-being, immune function, and treatment adherence. Integration of MBIs alongside EPI offers improved clinical outcomes by lowering stress and reducing side effects, ultimately supporting both psychological and physical recovery. This comprehensive care model can potentially promote long-term health and quality of life for cancer patients."

AIM: To determine the efficacy of Qi-based mindfulness therapy (QMT) in treating anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances in individuals with mild-to-moderate depression. METHODS: A self-controlled before-after trial was conducted. The study invited online participants for recruitment between May and July 2023. Participants (n = 18) aged 18-65 years with mild-to-moderate depression, who were receiving QMT training for 4 weeks, were included. The primary efficacy indicators were the 17 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores. The secondary outcome indicators included the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, the self-rating Anxiety Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted. The patients' symptoms related to depression, anxiety, and insomnia were reassessed 4 weeks after the post-intervention evaluation. RESULTS: Patients who underwent the QMT intervention for 4 weeks exhibited a statistically significant reduction in scores on the 17 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index relative to their pre-intervention scores (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: QMT training for 4 weeks is an effective nonpharmacological treatment for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among patients with mild-to-moderate depression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychotic disorders are characterized by both positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) and negative symptoms (emotional blunting, anhedonia) that impair daily functioning. While antipsychotic drugs and psychological interventions are effective when addressing positive symptoms, treatment of negative symptoms remains an ongoing challenge. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been shown to reduce negative psychotic symptoms. However, as negative psychotic symptoms are assessed as a sole entity rather than a sum of manifestations, the effect of MBIs remains unclear. AIM: To examine the effects of MBI in addition to integrated rehabilitation treatment (IRT) for people experiencing psychosis on each of the negative psychotic symptoms. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial with preintervention and postintervention measures was designed. The main outcome variable was negative psychotic symptoms assessed through the seven subscales of the Spanish version of the positive and negative syndrome scale. Data were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance and reliable change index calculation. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between groups at the preintervention assessment. Statistically significant differences were found after MBI for the time in emotional withdrawal (F = 37.75, P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.437) and social withdrawal (F = 37.75, P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.437). CONCLUSION: MBI added to IRT reduced the lack of interest and involvement with affective commitment to daily life activities, and interest and engagement in social activities increased. These negative psychotic symptoms were not improved by IRT alone."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nursing students encounter significant academic and psychological challenges that can impede their transition from theoretical knowledge to practical application, affecting their well-being and professional development. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Reflective Mindfulness and Emotional Regulation Training (RMERT) in improving nursing students' self-awareness, understanding, and emotional regulation. DESIGN AND METHODS: This study employed a convergent parallel mixed-method randomized controlled trial design. Forty fourth-year undergraduate nursing students were randomly assigned using simple randomization (computer-generated random numbers) into either an intervention group (n = 20) or a control group (n = 20). The intervention group participated in a six-week RMERT program designed to enhance self-awareness, understanding, and emotional regulation. The control group continued with standard course activities. Quantitative data were collected pre- and post-intervention using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), and analyzed using SPSS. Qualitative data, gathered exclusively from the intervention group through recorded reflective group sessions, were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The intervention group exhibited significantly improved self-awareness, understanding, and emotional regulation compared to the control group. Additionally, students displayed an increased capacity for mindfulness, a decreased tendency to suppress emotions, and greater comfort in reflecting on positive and negative emotions. CONCLUSION: Integrating RMERT into nursing curricula may enhance nursing students' well-being and professional growth, mainly when counseling resources are limited. The program can improve self-awareness, understanding, and regulation skills necessary for effective nursing practice. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Integrating RMERT into nursing curricula enhances self-awareness, emotional regulation, and reflective practice. This approach equips students with essential skills for managing clinical stress and building therapeutic relationships. As future nurses, they develop resilience, clinical reasoning, and empathetic patient care, ultimately elevating care quality and professional growth in diverse healthcare settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The study was registered retrospectively on https://register. CLINICALTRIALS: gov/ on 23 of December 2024 under the reference number: NCT06760962."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: It remains unknown whether difficulties in positive emotion regulation (ER) drive opioid use disorder (OUD) and whether these difficulties may be remediated. OBJECTIVE: To test whether OUD is associated with attenuated positive ER and whether such positive emotion dysregulation may be treated by mindfulness-based intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this mechanistic substudy of a randomized clinical trial, patients with chronic pain who did and did not meet criteria for OUD (OUD+ and OUD-, respectively) were recruited from primary care and pain clinics in Utah from January 2016 to and January 2020 and completed a positive ER task and questionnaires. A subsample of participants at risk for opioid misuse were randomized 1:1 to 8 weeks of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) or supportive group (SG) therapy and then completed the ER task at posttreatment and questionnaires through 3-month follow-up. Data were analyzed from December 2022 to June 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary mechanistic outcome was parietal late positive potential (LPP) and P300 amplitude during positive ER. Secondary outcomes included self-reported anhedonia, positive affect, attention to positive information, and opioid craving. RESULTS: The 160 participants used opioids for a mean (SD) duration of 9.7 (8.4) years, and 98 participants (61.3%) were classified as OUD+. Mean (SD) participant age was 53.7 (11.9) years, and 102 participants (63.8%) were female. A significant group × task strategy (View, Regulate) interaction was observed during positive ER, characterized by the OUD+ group exhibiting lower LPP responses during Regulate compared to View trials relative to the OUD- group (B = 1.91; 95% CI, 0.85-2.96; P < .001). A significant group × strategy interaction was also observed for the P300 (B = 1.40; 95% CI, 0.14-2.67; P = .03). LPP blunting during positive ER mediated the association between OUD status and elevated opioid craving. In the treatment subsample (n = 62), patients treated with MORE showed greater increases in the LPP during Regulate compared with View trials than patients treated with SG (B = 1.53; 95% CI, 0.33-2.73; P = .01). Additionally, MORE improved attention to positive information (B = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.14-5.57; P = .004), positive affect (B = 4.73; 95% CI, 1.22-8.24; P = .01), and anhedonia (B = 2.94; 95% CI, 0.58-5.31; P = .02) while reducing craving (B = -10.88; 95% CI, -21.29 to -0.48; P = .04) to a greater extent than SG. Higher positive ER efficacy predicted lower craving at follow-up (B = -2.38; 95% CI, -4.55 to -0.21; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: OUD among patients with chronic pain is characterized by difficulties in positive ER, evident in neurophysiological markers of salience detection and emotional elaboration. In this study, training in mindfulness and savoring via MORE enhanced positive ER, which in turn reduced craving, indicating that interventions that normalize reward system function may remediate OUD.

Enhancing HRV may help mitigate symptoms of panic disorder. This study investigated the effects of Rajyoga mindfulness meditation training on HRV in patients with panic disorder. METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial included 110 patients with panic disorder recruited from a psychiatry department in India. Participants were randomized to either an 8-week Rajyoga meditation intervention (n = 55) or a waitlist control group (n = 55) receiving standard treatment alone. HRV was measured at baseline and after 8 weeks using time domain (SDRR, RMSSD, pNN50) and frequency domain (total power, HF, LF, LF/HF ratio) parameters. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant differences in demographics or HRV parameters between groups. After 8 weeks, the Rajyoga group showed significant increases in SDRR, RMSSD, pNN50, and total power compared to controls (P < 0.05), indicating improved parasympathetic activity. The LF/HF ratio decreased in the Rajyoga group versus controls, suggesting a shift toward parasympathetic predominance. CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks of Rajyoga mindfulness meditation training improved HRV and parasympathetic activity in patients with panic disorder compared to standard treatment alone. Rajyoga meditation may be a beneficial adjunctive intervention for enhancing autonomic regulation in panic disorder."

Apart from basic psychosocial support, there are no evidence-based aftercare services for individuals in recovery. Recently, mindfulness-based interventions have shown promising results in preventing relapse. We discuss the context, challenges and opportunities of organising a 2-day intensive face-to-face mindfulness-based training for Nepalese mental health professionals to facilitate 8-week mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP). Altogether, 24 participants completed the feedback questionnaire. Most were rehabilitation staff, along with a few psychologists and psychiatrists. Feedback suggested a high degree of satisfaction and provided comments to improve the programme. It has prompted us to design online MBRP training and set up a feasibility study for an MBRP programme in Nepal. If successful, this may help a huge number of individuals in recovery."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Stroke often leads to persistent cognitive and emotional impairments, which rehabilitation may mitigate. However, the biological mechanisms underlying such improvements remain unclear. This study investigated whether supplementing computerized cognitive training (CCT) with mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) or physical exercise (PE) modulated biomarkers of neuroplasticity, inflammation, and stress in patients with chronic stroke compared to CCT alone. We also explored whether biomarker changes mediated or correlated with behavioral improvements. Methods: In a three-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial (NCT04759950), 141 patients with chronic stroke were randomized (1:1:1) to MBSR+CCT, PE+CCT, or CCT-only for 12 weeks. Plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and cortisol were measured at baseline and post-intervention. Cognitive, mental health, mindfulness, and fitness outcomes were also assessed. Between- and within-group changes were analyzed using ANCOVA and paired t-tests. Per-protocol and complete-case analyses were conducted. Results: Among the 109 participants with ≥80% adherence, the only significant between-group difference was for VEGF: it remained stable in the MBSR+CCT group but declined in PE+CCT and CCT-only. Within-group analyses showed significant decreases in cortisol in MBSR+CCT and PE+CCT, while IGF-1 levels declined across all groups. In contrast, BDNF, IL-6, and CRP did not show significant changes, and biomarker changes were not significantly associated with behavioral improvements. Complete-case analysis (n = 126) yielded similar findings. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that combining MBSR or PE with CCT may modulate certain biological processes relevant to stroke recovery. MBSR may help maintain VEGF levels, which could support vascular health, while MBSR and PE may contribute to lowering cortisol levels. However, since no clear association with behavioral improvements was found, further research is needed to determine the clinical relevance of these biomarker changes in stroke recovery."

      "abstract": "The need for psychological treatment in the community, specifically in times of crisis and for those in isolation, calls for finding suitable interventions, especially for older adults. The present study examined the effect of a short mindfulness-based intervention emphasizing a 'decentering' component and an equivalent guided-imagery intervention on cognitive and emotional measures in seniors living in the community. Thirty community seniors (Mage = 74.7) performed either 'decentering' or matched guided-imagery intervention, or care as usual as a control. The 8-week interventions included weekly 20 min sessions and daily 10 min home practice. Participants underwent a cognitive and emotional assessment before and after the interventions, which included filling out questionnaires and performing the cognitive Simon task. The results showed improvements only for intervention groups: cognitively, reduced response time and improved accuracy rate were found in the Simon task. Emotionally, reported depression levels were decreased and an increase in reported positive relationships was found. Our study, hence, introduces two intervention protocols, with promising positive effects on psychological and cognitive status. This contributes evidence-based treatments, easy to deliver in nursing homes or retirement communities, for improving the life quality of older adults."

Study 1 measured mindfulness and EF in Chinese students in grades 4-5. Differences in the level of mindfulness among children in grade 4 (n = 159) and grade 5 (n = 187) in rural China were analyzed by multi-factor analysis of variance. Correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to explore the relationship between mindfulness and EF in grade 4 (n = 103) and grade 5 (n = 124). Study 2 included 45 4th graders with a general mindfulness level, with 21 children in the experimental group receiving 12 mindfulness training lessons. The mindfulness and EF scores of individuals in the mindfulness and control groups were tested before and after the intervention. Study 1 showed that 4th graders had significantly lower mindfulness scores than 5th graders. EFs in grades 4-5 were significantly correlated with mindfulness. Study 2 revealed that mindfulness training significantly improved the experimental group's mindfulness and working memory. A non-significant improvement in inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility was observed. There was a significant difference in mindfulness in grades 4 and 5 of Chinese rural upper-grade elementary school. Children who perform well in mindfulness also perform well in EFs. Mindfulness training improved the mindfulness and working memory of 4th graders in rural China with a general mindfulness level."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Adolescence is a critical period for mental health, with depression increasing rapidly and often leading to lifelong consequences. In recent decades, the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents has steadily risen, making it a significant public health concern. While research supports the benefits of mindfulness-based practices in reducing adolescent depressive symptoms, the role of trait mindfulness remains underexplored. Although some studies suggest a link between trait mindfulness and lower depressive symptomatology, a longitudinal perspective could provide deeper insights into this relationship. Given adolescents' heightened vulnerability to mental health issues, understanding the potential causal link between trait mindfulness and depression is crucial for both prevention and intervention efforts. Methods: This study examines the relationship between mindfulness and depression in a three-wave longitudinal study of 1618 secondary school students (Males: N = 671, M = 16.4 years, SD = 0.60; Females: N = 947, M = 16.3 years, SD = 0.65) using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model. Results: Findings indicate that mindfulness and depression share a substantial proportion of variance (r = 0.48) at the stable trait level, suggesting that sustained attentional focus, a hallmark of mindfulness, is consistently associated with fewer depressive symptoms. At the within-person level, momentary deviations from stable mindfulness levels in the first and second waves were linked to lower depressive symptoms in subsequent waves (β = -0.21, p = 0.016; β = -0.44, p = 0.03, respectively). These findings suggest that even temporary increases in mindfulness may provide additional protection against depression. Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that trait mindfulness is associated with a reduced risk of developing depressive symptoms at both the between-person and within-person levels. Specifically, adolescents with higher stable levels of mindfulness tend to report fewer depressive symptoms over time, and even momentary increases in mindfulness beyond an individual's typical level are linked to reductions in subsequent depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the potential of mindfulness-based interventions in mitigating adolescent depression and underscore the importance of cultivating mindfulness as a protective factor during this critical stage of development."

      "abstract": "Modern societies and their obesogenic environments expose individuals to persistent food stimulation. This frequent exposure can cause sensory systems to habituate or desensitize to food-related sensory stimulation. This can, in turn, lead to the reduction of pleasure associated with eating, which can elicit overeating behavior to attain the desired pleasurable effect. However, frequently engaging in overeating behavior can lead to excessive weight gain, which is associated with the development of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. Mindfulness training could serve as a tool to reduce the habituation response elicited by frequent food exposure while promoting mindful eating, emotion regulation, and reducing overeating behavior. To investigate this, the present study was registered as a clinical trial on the ISRCTN registry: trial ID ISRCTN12901054. In the study, meditation-naïve individuals with a tendency to stress-eat (N = 56) participated in either a 31-day, web-based, food-related mindfulness training or health training condition. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral data were acquired before and after the intervention. During the fMRI sessions, hungry and stressed participants were exposed to visual and olfactory high-calorie food stimuli. The results indicate that hunger and stress ratings increased in both groups during the fMRI sessions but that mindfulness training, in comparison to health training, may significantly reduce the habituation response to food stimuli. Our results demonstrate that the habituation response could be implicated through the increase of neural activity in brain regions involved in visual and olfactory processing as well as emotion regulation. This study, therefore, demonstrates that mindfulness training could improve the ability to attend to food stimuli, which may enhance the pleasurable experience of eating, thereby diminishing an individual's tendency to engage in overeating behavior.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral counseling in pregnant women with body image dissatisfaction: A randomized controlled trial. METHODS: In this study, 50 pregnant women who were over 26 weeks pregnant were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. In the intervention group, Mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy was taught to pregnant women over 8 consecutive sessions, while the control group received no intervention. Body image concerns questionnaire was completed by both groups before and after the intervention, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The results showed that before the intervention, the mean and standard deviation of body image concern scores in the intervention group was 58.36 ± 3.13 and in the control group, was 58.08 ± 3.31, but after the end of the intervention, in the intervention group it decreased to 41.40 ± 2.85 (p < 0.001), while in the control group, it decreased (57.64 ± 3.42) slightly (P = 0.951). The total scores for body image concern in the intervention group were significantly lower compared to the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy can help reduce body image concerns in pregnant women. Therefore, it is recommended that mental health professionals utilize this approach to improve the psychological and physical well-being of pregnant women and assist them in modifying their attitudes towards body image."

This has exacerbated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) programme in the Chinese population, which is feasible among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 pandemic period in reducing the parental stress of parents compared with the usual care group. METHODS: This study was designed as a pilot randomized controlled trial with single-blind repeated measures. Parents of children aged 3-12 years with a diagnosis of ADHD were recruited from the parent resource center (PRC) of a local nongovernmental organization between June and August 2022. The participants were randomly assigned to the MBSR intervention group (n = 18) or usual care group (n = 18). RESULTS: With respect to the feasibility of the study, all 36 participants who were randomized fully completed the MBSR programme and assessments, resulting in a 100% attendance rate. 66% of the participants in the intervention group reported satisfaction with the intervention, which was helpful in reducing stress. They were willing to stay on this mindfulness-based programme in the future. The results of the repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant difference in self-perceived stress reduction between the groups (p < 0.001, ES = 0.192). The of within-group results revealed that the mean score of the intervention group decreased from 29.44 before the intervention to 25.50 (p < 0.001) immediately after intervention, and further decreased to 24.72 (p < 0.05) at one month after the intervention. By using the parental stress scale, the interaction effects also revealed significant differences between groups (p < 0.001, ES = 0.599). The stress level of the intervention group decreased from 74.50 before intervention, to 68.94 (p < 0.001) immediately after intervention, and further decreased to 67.50 (p < 0.05) at one month after intervention. These reports revealed statistically significant improvements in stress reduction and parental stress reduction in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: The pilot study revealed that MBSR is feasible and acceptable for parents of children with ADHD in Chinese culture. The findings also suggested that the MBSR programme was effective in reducing parental stress and enhancing mental well-being. This study was registered in the National Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information Clinical Trials Registry as Version 1, and the trial registration data are available as NCT06210113, 28/2/2024.",

This systematic review examines the effectiveness of MBSR in treating anxiety disorders in individuals aged 13-26. The review addresses three key themes: \"The Prevalence and Impact of Anxiety Disorders in Everyday Life,\" \"The Efficacy and Effectiveness of MBSR in the Management of Anxiety Disorders,\" and \"The Techniques and Interventions of MBSR in Anxiety Treatment.\" A total of nine studies were included in the meta-analysis, focusing on individuals aged 13-26 participating in MBSR interventions. The findings consistently indicate significant reductions in level of anxiety, along with improvements in emotional regulation and coping skills. These results suggest that MBSR is an effective therapeutic tool for managing anxiety disorders in this demographic, demonstrating notable efficacy across diverse settings. Meta-analytic evidence, following PRISMA guidelines, indicates MBSR as a powerful intervention for reducing anxiety and enhancing overall mental health within this age group. The review emphasizes the necessity for practitioners to incorporate MBSR into clinical practice as it offers benefits for long-term anxiety management."

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has previously alleviated IBS symptoms. Bioenergy economy (BEE) is a novel mind-body intervention that has shown moderating effects on many psychological and physical symptoms, particularly in chronic diseases. This research aimed to compare the effectiveness of MBCT and BEE on IBS symptom severity, somatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted using a quasi-experimental method with a pre-test, post-test, and follow-up design with a control group in Isfahan, Iran. Forty-five patients with IBS were divided into two experimental and one control group (15 subjects in each group). The patients were assessed using the ROME III Diagnostic Criteria for IBS, IBS Severity Index (IBS-SI), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15) before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance, and SPSS-22 software was used. RESULTS: The findings showed that MBCT and BEE both had significant effects on the IBS symptom severity, somatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between the mean scores of the two experimental groups in any of the post-test or the follow-up stages (P > 0.05). This concludes that there was no difference between the effectiveness of MBCT and BEE programs (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although both interventions had significant results in improving patients' symptoms, the BEE program had a stronger and wider range of effectiveness."

METHODS: In this randomized interventional study we examined the change in the score of specific neuropsychiatric scales/questionnaires before and after the 12-week WHM-based training program. We compared the change with a control group with no intervention. RESULTS: We obtained complete data from 12 patients in the WHM group and 13 patients in the control group. After 12 weeks, the WHM group had significantly higher improvement in cognition - SDMT (p = 0.045), TMT-A (p = 0.041), TMT-B (p < 0.001); fatigue - FSMCC (p = 0.039); anxiety - GAD (p = 0.015), and depression - PHQ-9 (p = 0.033).

Both music and mindfulness have been shown to increase HRV, and clinical approaches incorporating these interventions show promise as effective treatments for symptoms of anxiety and depression. Music mindfulness, which combines music listening with mindfulness activities, may provide unique and synergistic therapeutic benefits for stress management. However, to date, no studies have evaluated the physiological mechanisms underlying a community-based music mindfulness paradigm. METHODS: We used wearable technology to record electrocardiography and electroencephalography signals from participants with moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression during a community-based music mindfulness paradigm. We also assessed the impact of our music mindfulness session on participant's psychological state. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We found that music mindfulness sessions acutely enhanced multiple measures of HRV and altered EEG power spectral density across various frequency bands in frontotemporal electrodes. Both live and virtual music mindfulness sessions also acutely reduced stress and altered participants' state of consciousness; however, only live sessions fostered social connection. Additionally, the physiological and psychological effects of music mindfulness varied based on participants' self-reported sex. Overall, our findings demonstrate that music mindfulness effectively engages autonomic and frontotemporal neural mechanisms, which may contribute to the treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: An increasing body of evidence suggests that exercise positive affect contribute to sustained engagement in physical activity, yet few studies have proposed intervention strategies targeting exercise affect. Currently, mindfulness is considered to have the potential to promote the improvement of exercise affect and physical activity. This study combines cross-sectional design and longitudinal design to explore the relationship between trait mindfulness and physical activity, and examines whether exercise positive well-being and exercise psychological distress mediate this relationship. METHODS: At first, this study adopted a large sample cross-sectional design, and assessed the participants' trait mindfulness, exercise positive well-being, exercise psychological distress and physical activity through online self-report survey (n = 853, male = 54.7%; Mage = 19.16, SD = 0.97). Subsequently, a subset of participants from the cross-sectional study (n = 354, male = 52.8%; Mage = 19.21, SD = 0.86) were followed up for three months by longitudinal follow-up design, and the time relationships between these variables was examined. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional survey, the results of the correlation analysis showed that trait mindfulness, exercise positive well-being, and physical activity were all significantly positively correlated, while psychological distress was negatively correlated with the other variables. Similar correlations were observed during longitudinal follow-up. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that exercise positive well-being and exercise psychological distress served as parallel mediators in the relationship between trait mindfulness and physical activity. CONCLUSION: Exercise positive well-being and exercise psychological distress may serve as potential mechanisms through which trait mindfulness influences physical activity. This provides a theoretical basis and practical direction for future development of mindfulness-based interventions to promote physical activity.",

It tested stress-reducing effects in everyday life throughout an eight-week intervention period. METHOD: Non-faculty employees (n = 138; age M = 38.19; 75.36% female; 54.5% White, 27.54% Hispanic; 51.45% with a professional degree) from a university in California's Central Valley were randomized into either the Headspace condition (instructed to complete 10 minutes of meditation daily) or wait-list (inactive) control group. Participants completed ecological momentary assessments of stress five times a day for four consecutive days at baseline, at two and five weeks after randomization (mid-intervention), and at eight weeks post-randomization (post-intervention), resulting in 6260 observations of stress dimensions. RESULTS: Hierarchical linear models were used to test the interaction of condition by time, revealing significant effects for subjective stress, perceived coping, and perseverative cognitions. By week 2, compared to the baseline, participants in the Headspace condition reported less subjective stress and perseverative cognitions, and by week 5 reported more perceived coping. These effects persisted through week 8. No changes were observed for stressor appraisal. Participants in the control condition reported increases in subjective stress and perseverative cognitions, and decreases in coping, throughout the intervention period. DISCUSSION: Headspace was effective at reducing stress in a high-stress environment. Findings suggest the potential for relatively quick and sustained gains in stress benefits from meditation practice that may help practitioners develop their future programs.",

The present study investigated mindfulness with elementary school students using random assignment and objective measures. The sample included 292 5th graders from 21 classrooms randomly assigned to an 8-week mindfulness training or wait-list control group. Students were assessed at pre- and post-intervention on behavioral measures of executive functioning and teacher-rated social emotional competence, along with end of year social-emotional learning report card grades. Analyses using hierarchal linear modeling found that students in the intervention group demonstrated significant gains on a computerized task of cognitive flexibility, and end of year social-emotional learning grades controlling for prior year grades, but not teacher reported social emotional competence. Taken together these findings point to a simple, yet promising method for bolstering students' cognitive and social emotional skills."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The inclusion of behavioral therapy and stress reduction techniques among vocational students of the Nigerian universities is crucial for enhancing their practical skill acquisition and career prospects in challenging academic scenarios. This study explored the combined effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction in reducing test anxiety among business education students in a measurement and evaluation course. METHODS: Employing a randomized control trial with a pretest-posttest design, the research draws responses from 483 students from two universities in Southeast Nigeria. The participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or waitlist control groups on the basis of set inclusion criteria. Data collection was conducted via four different instruments, and the treatment group participated in a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (CBT-MBSR) program. Evaluations of both groups were conducted at three different stages: before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and during the follow-up period. Analysis was carried out via repeated-measures ANOVA and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). RESULTS: The results indicated that TVET students who underwent the CBT-MBSR intervention had significantly lower post-treatment test anxiety scores than those in the wait-list control group. The intervention also had a significant multivariate effect on reducing test anxiety, improved mindfulness, students' academic achievement, and their well-being (F value = 1168.52 (p =.001, η² = 0.752). CONCLUSION: This study assessed the efficacy of CBT with MBSR in reducing test anxiety, improving academic performance, and increasing well-being among students in TVET settings. The study revealed how CBT helped reduce test anxiety, thereby improving students' academic performance through increasing their concentration. Thus, this study provides fresh knowledge on how to improve psychological well-being and educational performance by introducing a new method of combining MBSR and CBT, which enriches the literature with a dual-modality approach that helps students reduce their anxieties and fosters their personal growth. This study has practical implications for university administrators, educators, and researchers and offers several recommendations. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Healthcare workers, most notably nursing professionals, face high levels of recurrent stress that lead to symptoms of burnout and other negative mental health outcomes. This indicates the need for greater individual and organizational health system support, including implementation of effective, evidence-based interventions for burnout reduction in this population. Organizationally supported mindfulness-based interventions can be used to build individual resilience, buffering the detrimental effects of occupational stress and enhance professional well-being. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of an evidence-based mindfulness intervention on perceived stress, burnout, resilience, and work engagement in nursing professionals. METHODS: A non-randomized single arm, pre/post design was used for this study. Healthcare workers (n = 631), including Registered Nurses and Advanced Practice Nurses (n = 128), physicians (n = 105), social workers (n = 21), pharmacists (n = 8), chaplains (n = 30), physician and occupational therapists (n = 39), patient care assistants (n = 13), other clinical staff (n = 26), non-clinical staff (n = 229), and 32 others participated in Mindfulness in Motion, an 8-week evidence-based worksite mindfulness intervention. Validated self-report measures assessing burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), resilience (Connor Davidson Resiliency Scale), and work engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Score) were given pre and post program. Total burnout was determined by scores on the subscales of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: Emotional exhaustion >27 or depersonalization >13 or personal accomplishment <31. RESULTS: Significant reductions in burnout (p < 0.00001), perceived stress (p < 0.00001), with significant increases in resilience (p < 0.00001), and work engagement (p < 0.00001) were observed among Registered and Advanced Practice Nurses comparing pre-post measures. Notably, the number of nursing professionals who no longer qualified as burned out was 10% higher than the other participants. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that nursing professionals could greatly benefit from organizationally supported mindfulness-based interventions such as Mindfulness in Motion and may benefit them most compared to other health system employees."

METHODS: This was a non-randomized, single-center study designed to assess the feasibility and benefits of a mindfulness and compassion program for individuals living with cancer (MCP-C). The primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility of the program, while the secondary objective was to assess its effectiveness in adult cancer patients and their relatives. Before and after completing the program, participants completed the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A qualitative study was also conducted using focus groups and a structured qualitative survey. RESULTS: A total of eight courses were delivered, six in person in 2019 and two online in 2020. A total of 153 participants were enrolled, of whom 142 were considered evaluable. Among them, 90 (64.3%) completed the program, including 75 patients (83.3%) and 15 relatives. The intervention was associated with significant reductions (p < 0.01) in mean scores on the GHQ- 12 and the HADS-A and HADS-D subscales. In the qualitative assessment, participants reported multiple benefits, including increased awareness of health-related decision-making, improved relationship with the disease, a sense of companionship, emotional support, and overall enhancements in daily life. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing an 8-week mindfulness and self-compassion program within the routine practice of a public hospital was feasible and led to significant improvements in the psychological well-being of cancer patients and their relatives."

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effects on fatigue of having 4 weeks of access to audio recordings of therapeutic hypnosis (HYP) and mindfulness meditation (MM) practices. METHODS: A total of 333 individuals with MS and fatigue were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment conditions for 28 weeks: (1) access to therapeutic HYP audio recordings, (2) access to MM audio recordings, or (3) no access to recordings (treatment as usual or TAU). Fatigue impact (primary outcome) and other outcomes were assessed at 4, 16, and 28 weeks after random assignment. RESULTS: Participants assigned to the HYP and MM conditions reported significantly greater reductions in fatigue impact, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptom severity than participants assigned to the TAU condition after 4 weeks of access to audio recordings of these interventions. These improvements were maintained for 16 and 28 weeks following initial access and did not result in any serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Given the ease with which audio recordings of HYP and MM could be provided to individuals with MS, the findings support the feasibility of a simple approach to have a significant beneficial impact on people with MS-related fatigue."

This study aimed to compare the effects of group and individual mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy (MBCT) on the happiness of postmenopausal women. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial of 48 postmenopausal women who received group or individual MBCT counseling. Literate postmenopausal women aged 50-64 years, 1-10 years after menopause, and with Happiness Scale scores less than 40-42 were recruited for this study. A demographic questionnaire and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire were used to collect the data. Women in the group counseling group received 8 sessions of counseling according to MBCT, while women in the individual counseling group received counseling individually. Independent t-tests, Chi-square tests and two-way Repeated Measures ANOVA were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The scores of all components of happiness including self-concept, life satisfaction, mental preparation, active well-being, aesthetic sense, self-efficacy, and hope, increased in both groups immediately after and 1 month after the completion of the intervention. The total happiness score in the group counseling group improved from 33.39 ± 5.57 before the intervention to 48.91 ± 6.77 and 48 ± 6.38 after the intervention and during the follow-up period, respectively (p value < 0.001). These scores in the individual counseling group improved from 32.13 ± 5.40 to 46.04 ± 7.80 and 45.13 ± 7.26 immediately after the intervention during the follow-up period, respectively (p value < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that although the scores of all components of happiness were slightly greater in the counseling group than the individual group, there was no significant difference between the two groups. Using either method is recommended for increasing the happiness of postmenopausal women."

This study aimed at involving women with endometriosis in the co-development process of a digital version of MY-ENDO to investigate their experiences with and attitudes toward the intervention. METHODS: The study was designed as a qualitative feasibility study. The empirical material consisted of 35 interviews with seven women who self-reported a diagnosis with endometriosis, based on a semi-structured interview guide. Each participant completed the first four sessions of the intervention and was interviewed before the first and after each of the four sessions (five times in total) during participation. The study was based on a phenomenological approach and the data were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis strategy. RESULTS: Analysis indicated that the two parts of the program called 'knowledge of the disease' and 'management of the disease' with eight related subthemes were crucial for participants' outcomes. In addition, a generic theme called 'motivation and alliance' was identified. CONCLUSION: The digital self-management intervention MY-ENDO was generally experienced and evaluated as positive. It was considered an advantage that the program was specifically tailored to and targeting endometriosis as well as developed in collaboration with patients. Having a contact person was deemed important with regard to maintenance and motivation suggesting potential consequences for the implementation of this digital solution in clinical practice.",

Online MBIs address access barriers, but large-scale implementation from the perspectives of key knowledge users remains understudied. This study explored the implementation considerations of PwMS, care partners, MS clinicians and MBI instructors for building online MBIs for PwMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design with an integrated knowledge translation (iKT) approach. Virtual semi-structured interviews explored the perspectives of PwMS (n = 10), care partners (n = 3), MS clinicians (n = 8), and MBI instructors (n = 8). An inductive thematic analysis approach was used. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: (1) daily mindfulness: structuring and conceptualizing mindfulness for PwMS, (2) unlocking access through enhanced clinician awareness and advocacy: building pathways to MBIs for PwMS, (3) validating mindfulness experiences: the importance of MBI group composition and instructor interactions for PwMS, and (4) sustained engagement: resources to create and navigate MBIs for PwMS. CONCLUSIONS: PwMS valued diverse participant groups and control over tailoring MBIs to their needs. However, guidance from a clinician may be needed to foster self-agency for PwMS. MBIs serve a multifaceted role for PwMS, extending beyond the diagnosis. Shared decision-making amongst knowledge users can enhance flexible programming of online MBIs."

AIM: To assess the impact of caregiver-shared decision-making in family nutritional support with mindfulness-based behavioral therapy on the risk of malnutrition and mood states in patients with gastrointestinal tumors. METHODS: Patients with gastrointestinal tumors (n = 118) treated at the Jiangnan University Affiliated Hospital between December 2021 and March 2024 were assigned to the observation (n = 59) and control (n = 59) groups using the random number table method. In addition to the standard treatment and basic nursing measures implemented in the control group, the integrated approach was implemented in the observation group. The nutritional and mood state indicators, compliance, and satisfaction before and 6 months after implementing the intervention were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The body mass index, serum albumin levels, and transferrin levels, as well as the scores for all seven dimensions of the Profile of Mood States questionnaire, in the observation were higher than those in the control group after the 6-month follow-up period (P < 0.05). However, the Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale scores were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The compliance and satisfaction rates were 94.92% and 98.31%, respectively, which were higher than those of the control group (79.66% and 88.14%, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The implementation of the integrated approach significantly reduced the risk of malnutrition and improved mood states in patients with gastrointestinal tumors. Moreover, the compliance and satisfaction rates were higher."

We investigated how mindfulness affects fear and depression in isolated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and whether it acts as a mediator. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of COVID-19 patients undergoing at-home treatment from February to April 2022. The survey included a questionnaire on fear of COVID-19 (measured by the Fear of COVID-19 Scale), mindfulness (measured by the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale), and depression (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire). A total of 380 participants completed the questionnaire. We analyzed the correlation between each variable and performed a mediation analysis using hierarchical regression and bootstrapping to verify the statistical significance of the mediating effects. RESULTS: Each variable was significantly correlated. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the association between the fear of COVID-19 and depression decreased from 0.377-0.255, suggesting that mindfulness partially mediates the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and depression. Bootstrapping analysis showed that the indirect effect of the mediating variable (mindfulness) is 0.121, which accounts for 32.3% of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that promote mindfulness in patients with acute COVID-19 may be beneficial for their mental health.",

The current research aimed to investigate whether long-term mindfulness meditation (MM) intervention enhances male athletes' attentional function and alters the activity of brain regions related to attention. In this experiment, we recruited 47 professional male fencer athletes completed two main trials-an MM trial and a control trial. In MM trial, the participants were provided with 3 sessions/wk (20 min/session) of mindfulness meditation training for 20 weeks. In control trial, the participants were instead assigned a mind-wandering related audio to listen to at that time. In each main trial, the five facets of mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ), cognitive function (i.e. attention span, attention concentrativeness, attention stability, attentional network, distractibility and attentional blink), salivary cortisol, blood lactate and mental fatigue were measured at baseline (pretest) and after the intervention (posttest). The cerebral oxygenation status was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy(fNIRS) during the cognitive function test. In cognition test, participants' attention span, attention concentrativeness, attention stability, attentional networks on task-relevant information (targets) were better in the MM group, supported by eliciting increased oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO) concentration in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Conversely, there are no remarkable different of distractibility and attentional blink on task-irrelevant information in the MM group than in the Con group (p > 0.05). Moreover, a lower mental fatigue level and lower salivary cortisol concentration were observed in the MM group than in the Con group after the intervention at posttest. Overall, 20-week MM training interventions after physical training improve attentive capacity and cerebral oxygenation concentration, decrease salivary cortisol concentrations and mental fatigue. The findings suggest that long-term MM training interventions after physical training facilitates focus during competition and improves athletic performance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Traditional management strategies for diabetes primarily focus on behavioural risk factors and pharmacological therapies. Furthermore, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) aim to assist patients in recognising and accepting sensations, emotions and cognitions without automatic reactivity. This approach can potentially enhance glycaemic control and mental health in diabetic patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the effects of MBIs among individuals diagnosed with diabetes. METHODS: A systematic literature search and meta-analysis were conducted following international quality standards utilised by the Cochrane Collaboration. Randomised controlled trials were included. The population of interest was defined as any patient diagnosed with diabetes; MBIs were defined as the intervention. Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Lilacs were accessed. A grey literature search was performed using OpenGrey and ClinicalTrials tools. Outcomes included changes in glycosylated haemoglobin percentage (%HbA1c), depression, and stress scores. The risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool, and publication bias was evaluated through Egger's test. The results were presented with forest plots. The mean difference (MD) for the %HbA1c and the standardised MD for the measurement scale scores were used as effect measures. RESULTS: The initial search retrieved 442 scientific articles, 11 randomised clinical trials were finally selected for the systematic review, which included 987 participants (487 in the intervention groups), and seven articles were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that MBIs had effects at follow-up (between 12 and 20 weeks) in reducing %HbA1c levels (MD = -0.5, CI 95% [-0.67, -0.34]) and depression SMD = -0.84, CI 95% [-1.11, -0.56]). CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that mindfulness significantly enhances mental health and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes. Further research is warranted to confirm these effects and gain a deeper understanding of the contribution of MBIs in comprehensive diabetes treatment."

AIMS: The study aimed to explore the changes in QST measures and the CSI in this sample following participation in a mindfulness and physical activity intervention compared to an online self-management guide. METHODS: Participants were randomised into (i) a combined mindfulness and exercise online interactive group or (ii) an online self-management group. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT), temporal summation (TS), conditioned pain modulation (CPM) measures, and the CSI were completed with participants at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Baseline (n = 33) and post-intervention (n = 22) measurements were completed. High mean CSI scores (54.69, SD 23.85) were noted at baseline in participants, indicating the presence of central sensitisation [n = 33; 70% (n = 23) score > 40]. Mean baseline scores for TS were high (2.64, SD 1.60), indicating the presence of pain facilitation, and variable results were observed for baseline PPT and CPM measures. The combined intervention was not found to be superior to a self-management guide in this cohort in terms of changes in PPT, TS, and CPM measures and the CSI. CONCLUSIONS: High baseline CSI and TS scores were identified in the cohort at baseline, with no notable trends identifiable with regard to changes in QST scores or the CSI post-intervention. Further studies are recommended with larger sample sizes in order to understand changes in QST measures following participation in interventions of this nature."

This review systematically examines the effectiveness of mHealth MBIs in improving perinatal psychological outcomes, including stress, anxiety and depression, with a secondary focus on safety, engagement, acceptability and dropout rates. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Scopus, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore, along with grey literature, for English-language journal articles from inception until July 2024. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality using standardized critical appraisal instrument. Significant heterogeneity in study designs, program structures and data collection methods precluded meta-analysis, leading to a narrative synthesis of the results. Fifteen studies were included, featuring a mix of quantitative and qualitative designs. Findings indicated that mHealth MBIs demonstrated promise in reducing stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum. However, participant engagement in these interventions was influenced by factors such as intervention complexity, user interface challenges and technological issues like app compatibility. Dropouts were commonly attributed to time constraints and technical difficulties, while user feedback emphasized the need for varied and flexible content to sustain interest and perceived effectiveness. Overall, mHealth MBIs offer potential benefits for perinatal psychological health, particularly in reducing stress and anxiety. However, maintaining high engagement and low dropout rates remains a challenge. Future studies should identify optimal intervention formats, enhance adherence and assess long-term impacts of mHealth MBIs to strengthen the evidence base, particularly in diverse settings and for pregnancy-related complications."

Further, we examined whether these mindfulness profiles were indirectly associated with alcohol and cannabis-related outcomes via alcohol and cannabis use motives. METHOD: Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to determine the number of latent classes among 771 US university students (75.7% White, 66.8% female) who consumed alcohol and cannabis in the prior month. Additionally, parallel mediation analyses were conducted to determine whether mindfulness profiles were indirectly associated with alcohol- and cannabis-related outcomes via alcohol and cannabis use motives. RESULTS: LPA indicated a 4-class solution fit optimally. Further, the high mindfulness group was generally the most adaptive (lower scores) across alcohol and cannabis outcomes, whereas the judgmentally observing group was generally the most maladaptive (higher scores). Indirect effect analyses revealed that compared to the low mindfulness group, the high mindfulness group reported lower scores on alcohol- and cannabis-related outcomes via lower alcohol- and cannabis-related coping motives. CONCLUSIONS: These findings can inform prevention and intervention efforts using mindfulness techniques and interventions among students who engage in problematic alcohol and cannabis use.

It thus addresses the problems of distractibility and superficial engagement caused by information overload and aims to prepare students for a fulfilling life. Based upon an in-depth dialogue among authors belonging to different disciplines, this conceptual synthesis integrates the various perspectives of Buddhist studies, philosophy of education, anthropology of education, clinical psychology, and psychiatry, to construct a comprehensive view of mindfulness for higher education. The structure of its argument progresses from the languishing to the flourishing of students, and from mindfulness taught in the form of interventions, to mindfulness cultivated as the very thread of learning. The article starts by reviewing the evidence regarding students' mental health and vulnerabilities, and moves to directly listening to their voices, larger aspirations, and more existential concerns. It next elaborates an epistemic and developmental model of mindful education, making creative use of T. S. Eliot's questions regarding information, knowledge, wisdom, and Life, to capture some ongoing, complex issues. MBCT's principles, formats, practices, and adaptations are then examined to envision skillful responses to these perceived challenges, with a proposal to further weave mindfulness into the constitution of higher education. Ultimately, in reference to Simone Weil, mindfulness training is conceived as guiding the \"formation of attention,\" along the \"joy of learning,\" to accomplish two interrelated humanistic ideals: academic excellence and human flourishing."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders underscores the need for a more profound comprehension of effective treatments. Mindfulness has shown promise in enhancing treatment outcomes and preventing relapse in these conditions, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. METHODS: This study examined the role of emotion regulation as a mediator in the relationship between changes in mindfulness and the reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms during individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). We tracked longitudinal changes in mindfulness, emotion regulation, depression, and anxiety at baseline (pre), early treatment (session 5), midtreatment (session 15), and posttreatment (session 25) in 162 patients with depression and anxiety disorders. Further, we examined whether the effects of mindfulness on emotion regulation could be enhanced by introducing a brief mindfulness intervention at the beginning of each CBT session, as compared to progressive muscle relaxation and individual psychotherapy without any standardized session-introducing interventions. RESULTS: Multilevel structural equation modeling indicated that decreases in rumination and increases in reappraisal and acceptance mediated the relationship between mindfulness and reductions in depressive symptoms. In contrast, reductions in avoidance explained the association between mindfulness and changes in anxiety symptoms. These links remained unchanged when adding a mindfulness intervention into individual CBT. CONCLUSION: Results support emotion regulatory properties of mindfulness and highlight distinct pathways of symptom reduction in depression and anxiety. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of mindfulness and tailoring treatment to individual patient needs. This trial is registered with NTC02270073.",

Understanding for whom and how MBCT works may allow for improvements in treatment allocation and effectiveness. In this study, our aim was to investigate depressive rumination, content-independent perseverative thinking, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion as potential moderators and mediators of MBCT. Methods: In this non-randomized controlled trial, patients with persistent (n = 53) or recurrent MDD with (n = 31) or without (n = 51) a current depressive episode were assigned to an intervention (MBCT plus treatment as usual [TAU], n = 94) or control group (TAU only, n = 40) based on the time between the date of inclusion and the start of MBCT. Assessments were carried out before, halfway, and after 8 weeks of MBCT + TAU or TAU. Latent growth models were employed to examine moderation, while cross-lagged structural equation models were used to assess the mediating effects of several possible mediators of MBCT-induced change in depressive symptoms and overall functional impairment. Results: MBCT + TAU was more effective in reducing depressive symptoms (and overall functional impairment than TAU with a medium [d = -0.54] and small [d = 0.44] effect size, respectively). Higher baseline levels of rumination and perseverative thinking and lower levels of self-compassion moderated the effect of MBCT on depressive symptoms and overall functional impairment. Task-based negative intrusive thoughts moderated the effects of MBCT on overall functional impairment. No mediators were established, particularly due to a lack of effect of MBCT on all assessed mediators at mid-treatment. For interpretative purposes, a sample split (based on Johnson-Newman values) showed moderate-to-large effects in depressive symptom reduction for those with high rumination, high perseverative thinking, and low self-compassion, while negative-to-small nonsignificant effects were found for the opposite traits. Conclusion: In the future, MBCT allocation based on levels of rumination and self-compassion might lead to a more efficient reduction in depressive symptoms. Directions for mediation analysis within the context of MBCT for depression are discussed. Preregistration: This study was initially preregistered in the Dutch National Trial Register (NL7842). However, due to the NTR no longer being available since June 2022, the trial was reregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05802966, dd 09-Apr-2023). The statistical analysis plan was adjusted after the start of the trial but before the finalization of data collection (NCT05802966; ClinicalTrials.gov).",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective for LBP management when combined with medication and physical therapy. An understanding of patients' willingness to pay (WTP) and preferences is needed to integrate MBIs into standard LBP care. We examined WTP and preferences for MBIs, as well as associated factors, among patients with chronic LBP in the Hong Kong public healthcare sector. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in two Hong Kong public hospitals. We used the payment card method to assess patients' WTP for MBIs and performed a discrete choice experiment to examine patients' preferences for MBIs. Tobit regression was utilised to analyse factors associated with WTP for MBIs. Patients' relative preferences for MBIs were estimated through a mixed logit model. RESULTS: Mean WTP for an eight-session course of MBIs was HK$258.75±508.11. Higher pain scores, monthly family income >HK$30 000, high school education, higher treatment expenses, and stronger belief in MBIs were associated with greater WTP. Patients were more likely to choose MBIs with lower costs, greater improvements in pain relief and the ability to perform daily activities, and a face-to-face delivery mode. CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic LBP exhibited low WTP for MBIs. Strategies to improve education and awareness may enhance WTP; affordability and accessibility should be considered for individuals from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. The identified preferences provide insights for designing MBIs that align with patient needs. These findings offer valuable methodological references for other healthcare evaluations.",

The present set of four meta-analyses examined and quantified correlational relationships between trait mindfulness, trait anger, and trait aggression, as well as the effects of experimental mindfulness-based interventions on anger and aggression. These meta-analyses contained data from 118 correlational (dispositional mindfulness) and experimental (mindfulness-based intervention) studies. For the subset of self-report correlational studies (kanger = 243, kaggression = 286), we found small-to-medium inverse relationships between dispositional mindfulness and both anger (r = -0.23, p < .001) and aggression (r = -0.19, p < .001). For experimental studies (kanger = 95, kaggression = 38), we found medium effects. Specifically, mindfulness-based interventions produced lower anger (d = -0.48, p < .001) and aggression (d = -0.61, p < .001) relative to the control groups. In sum, results suggest that mindfulness can curb angry and aggressive responses. Effect sizes for the interventions were largest in Asia. Studies with passive versus active control groups showed larger effect sizes. Effect sizes were largely equivalent for all populations studied (e.g., clinical, forensic, healthy adults, medical, students). Our meta-analytic findings suggest that mindfulness training may aid the effective regulation of anger and aggression for diverse populations. They also highlight the need for more rigorous control groups in future research."

METHOD: A randomized controlled trial nested within a cohort study was conducted. Participants were allocated to either the MBHP intervention or an active control group (ACG) receiving computer-based cognitive stimulation. Outcomes included QOL, psychological health, sleep quality, and religiosity. Both interventions lasted four months. A mixed-methods approach was used, collecting qualitative and quantitative data at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in QOL were observed only in the ACG. However, the MBHP group showed improvements in stress, anxiety, intrinsic religiosity, and sleep quality compared to the ACG. Qualitative findings indicated enhanced perceptions of social support, self-awareness, self-care, and sleep quality in the MBHP group. Notably, a discrepancy emerged between the QOL quantitative results and the subjective improvements described in interviews. CONCLUSION: The MBHP program did not significantly improve QOL compared to the cognitive stimulation control. Nonetheless, well-being indicators were positively impacted in the MBHP group. Future research should explore which profiles of older adults might benefit most from regular mindfulness practice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is an effective treatment for various hematologic cancers, though it often results in severe side effects and psychological distress, which can negatively impact health outcomes. Integrative therapies like mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness meditation (MM), and music therapy (MT) yield promising results in enhancing both psychosocial outcomes (eg, reducing anxiety and depression) and physiological adaptation (eg, decreasing inflammation) in cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: We developed and refined, using focus groups and environmental and field testing, an eHealth-delivered mindfulness-based music therapy (eMBMT) intervention aimed at improving health-related quality of life, symptom burden (ie, pain, fatigue, and sleep), disease activity (ie, chronic graft-versus-host disease, cytomegalovirus activation, and infections) and psychosocial (ie, depression, anxiety, and cancer-specific distress) and physiological adaptation (ie, inflammation and immune reconstitution) tailored to adults receiving allo-SCT. METHODS: eMBMT intervention content is grounded in MT, MM, and MBSR, developed by a multidisciplinary team, and adapted for adults undergoing allo-SCT. eMBMT content was refined through focus groups and usability and field testing. Focus groups used a semistructured interview guide, while field testing used the \"think aloud\" method. Usability was evaluated using the 30-item Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use (USE) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics analyzed the USE questionnaire and participant characteristics, while rapid qualitative analysis was applied to focus groups and field-testing sessions. Survivors eligible to participate in the focus groups and usability and field testing were adults (>18 years old) who received an allo-SCT (<36 months) for myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, or chronic myeloid leukemia, and were in remission for greater than 3 months. RESULTS: During the focus groups, participants (n=11; mean age 43.6, SD 17.8 years) provided qualitative feedback highlighting the shock of diagnosis, challenges during hospitalization, and coping strategies posttreatment. The eMBMT platform received positive evaluations for usefulness (mean 6.47, SD 0.29), ease of use (mean 6.92, SD 0.60), and satisfaction (mean 6.16, SD 0.82). Key themes from field testing highlighted the significance of social support, hope, and maintaining an active lifestyle. Suggestions for improvement included incorporating more representative content, reducing text, enhancing guidance, offering diverse music options, and streamlining blood sample collection. CONCLUSIONS: The eMBMT intervention is a comprehensive, user-friendly eHealth tool tailored to the unique needs of allo-SCT patients. The positive feedback and identified areas for improvement underscore its potential to enhance well-being, symptom management, and overall quality of life for cancer survivors. A future pilot randomized controlled trial will further evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the eMBMT intervention in improving health-related quality of life, symptom burden, disease activity, and psychosocial and physiological adaptation.",

Aberrant salience-the exaggerated significance attribution to perceived elements-is associated with psychotic experiences, but its interactions with mindfulness remain unexplored. METHODS: This pre-post-intervention pilot study included 21 participants completing an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion (MBHP) course with measurements before (T0), after (T1), and three months post-course (T2). Primary outcomes were mindful attention (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS), decentering (Experiences Questionnaire, EQ), aberrant salience (Aberrant Salience Inventory, ASI), and correlations between time-dependent changes (T1-T0, T2-T0, T2-T1). Secondary outcomes included qualitative reports on Motivations, Learnings, Preferred Practices, and Stress Management. RESULTS: Regarding mindfulness, MAAS and EQ continuingly increased (T0 vs. T1/T2). Regarding aberrant salience, the factor Heightened Cognition (ASI) increased post-course (T0 vs. T1), whereas Heightened Emotionality (T0 vs. T2) and Total Aberrant Salience (T1 vs. T2) decreased. Importantly, MAAS (T1-T0, T2-T0) correlated negatively with Heightened Emotionality (T2-T0). Qualitative findings revealed consistent stressors but improved stress management, integrated mindfulness practices into participants' daily lives, and potential mechanisms of presence, observation, perspective change, and emotion regulation underlying decreased aberrant salience. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness may modulate pre-attentional and attentional processes and improve well-being and stress management, as reflected by reduced aberrant salience and promoted mindful attention and decentering. Our findings suggest that mindful attention may play a crucial role in reducing aberrant salience, offering a promising direction for future research on mindfulness interventions in psychosis."

DESIGN: A cross-sectional descriptive correlational study was conducted. METHODS: A convenient sample of 200 clients with substance use disorders was recruited. Data were collected using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, the Impulsive Sensation Seeking scale, and the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale. RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was found between mindfulness and readiness for change (r = 0.174, p = 0.014), and a significant negative correlation between readiness for change and impulsive sensation seeking (r = -0.219, p = 0.002). Impulsivity (mean percent score = 80.25%) and sensation-seeking traits (mean percent score = 78.73%) negatively impacted readiness for change. Mindfulness partially mediated the relationship between impulsive sensation seeking and readiness for change (indirect effect = -0.056, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based interventions show potential to enhance readiness for change by mitigating impulsivity. Addressing the interplay between impulsive sensation seeking, mindfulness, and readiness for change may promote recovery in clients with substance use disorders. While sustained recovery was not longitudinally assessed, findings suggest pathways for future investigation. NURSING IMPLICATIONS: Psychiatric nurses must incorporate mindfulness interventions, regular assessments of impulsivity, and tailored care plans in their care for clients with substance use disorders. Educating patients on mindfulness benefits and providing continuous support through the change process might improve substance use disorders treatment outcomes. By integrating these strategies, psychiatric nurses can significantly enhance the effectiveness of substance use disorders treatments."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) can necessitate opioid therapy. Effective approaches to reduce CLBP's symptoms and opioid-related harms are needed. Cognitive behavioral (CBT) and mindfulness-based (MBT) therapies may be useful but have not been well-studied for opioid-treated CLBP. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of MBT vs CBT in opioid-treated CLBP, hypothesizing MBT's superiority. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this 12-month community partner-informed, partially masked, multisite, randomized clinical trial, participants at primary and specialty care clinics and community settings were randomly assigned (1:1) to MBT or CBT groups. Participants included English-fluent adults (21 years or older), without prior MBT or CBT training, and with moderate-to-severe CLBP (average score ≥3 on the Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]; functional limitation score ≥20 on the Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]), treated with an opioid dosage of at least 15 mg/d of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for at least 3 months. Outcome data were collected from July 1, 2017, to November 23, 2022. Analysis used the intention-to-treat approach. INTERVENTIONS: Manual-based MBT or CBT interventions consisting of 8 weekly therapist-led group sessions and at-home practice. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported coprimary (average pain severity, 0-10 [BPI]; functional limitations, 0-100 [ODI]) and secondary (mental and physical health-related quality of life [QOL] on the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Health Survey and opioid dose in MME per day, Timeline Followback) outcomes compared at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Among 6024 screened individuals, 2926 were ineligible, 2328 were eligible, and 770 were enrolled, including 385 in the MBT and 385 in the CBT groups. Of these, 434 participants (56.4%) were female, 647 (84.0%) identified as non-Hispanic ethnicity, and 630 (81.8%) identified as White race; mean (SD) age was 57.8 (11.3) years. The mean (SD) BPI average pain score was 6.1 (1.6) (moderate pain) and the mean (SD) ODI functional limitation score was 47.2 (14.0) (moderate functional limitations), with reduced physical (mean [SD], 28.5 [8.3]) and mental (mean [SD], 42.5 [11.8]) health-related QOL on the SF-12 and high opioid dosage (mean [SD], 177 [1041] MME/d). Over time, each group significantly improved their outcomes, without serious adverse effects. The intention-to-treat linear mixed-effects model analysis did not detect significant between-group differences at 6 and 12 months for pain (0.21 [95% CI, -0.05 to 0.48; P = .12] and 0.13 [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.40; P = .33], respectively) or function (0.07 [95% CI, -1.80 to 1.93; P = .94], and 0.27 [95% CI, -1.59 to 2.12; P = .78], respectively) and indicated MBT's noninferiority relative to CBT on primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large trial, CLBP-related symptoms improved, while opioid dosage decreased in both MBT and CBT groups at 6 and 12 months. Increasing availability of these safe psychological therapies could help reduce individual and societal burdens of refractory, opioid-treated CLBP.

      "abstract": "The postpartum period has witnessed increasing rates of depression and anxiety, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with these conditions often co-occurring and being exacerbated by the lingering effects of long COVID. Traditional interventions, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and yoga, have demonstrated effectiveness in alleviating these symptoms. However, the limitations of in-person sessions, especially in the context of pandemic-related restrictions, highlight the need for accessible, innovative approaches. Integrating Virtual Reality (VR) technology with these traditional practices presents a novel solution, offering immersive, customizable environments that may enhance engagement and therapeutic outcomes. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a VR-enhanced mindfulness and yoga intervention in treating postpartum depression and anxiety in women affected by long COVID, with additional examination of underlying physiological stress markers and cognitive control mechanisms. In this randomized controlled trial, 111 postpartum women were randomly assigned to experimental (VR-enhanced intervention), control (traditional in-person sessions), or blank groups using computer-generated randomization. The 8-week intervention involved thrice-weekly 60-minute sessions. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 4-week follow-up using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, salivary cortisol measurements, and an emotional Stroop task. The VR-enhanced intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in both depression (EPDS: P < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.18) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7: P < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.17), with these therapeutic effects significantly greater than those observed in the control and blank groups (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). These improvements were strongly correlated (r = 0.68, P < 0.001). Supporting these primary outcomes, salivary cortisol levels showed a significant decrease (P < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.13), and cognitive control improved as evidenced by reduced emotional Stroop task conflict effect (P < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.37). Correlation analysis revealed robust associations between improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms and changes in physiological markers in both short-term and long-term outcomes. This study demonstrates that integrating VR technology with traditional mindfulness and yoga practices effectively reduces both postpartum depression and anxiety symptoms in the post-COVID era. The parallel improvements in physiological stress markers and cognitive control provide insight into potential mechanisms underlying these therapeutic effects. These findings underscore the value of immersive technology in enhancing traditional therapeutic approaches for addressing postpartum depression and anxiety in the post-pandemic context.",

Depressive symptoms are prevalent across various disorders and can significantly impact outcomes, therefore being an important transdiagnostic target. Multiple randomized controlled Trials (RCTs) have explored this question in discrete disorders; however, evidence has never been meta-analysed transdiagnostically. The Prospero-registered (CRD42022352046) systematic review has been conducted on EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsychINFO using terms related to Randomised controlled trials, mindfulness and depression in clinical samples aged between 18 and 65. Random-effects models were performed to assess the effectiveness of MBIs, including Mindfulness based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT), on depressive symptoms transdiagnostically. We conducted sensitivity, heterogeneity analyses, publication bias assessments, meta-regressions and assessed quality. Thirty-five studies, including participants from 12 different diagnostic categories, were included. The results revealed that MBCT, ACT, DBT and others are efficacious in treating depressive symptoms across psychiatric diagnoses compared to active control conditions, all with significant effect sizes. MBIs are effective in reducing depressive symptoms across psychiatric disorders. They should be considered as a potential cost-effective tool to be systematically implemented, not only in those with depression but across mental health disorders."

METHODS: A total of 42 women were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 21) or a treatment-as-usual (TAU) (n = 21). All participants completed a battery of assessments for pain, emotional distress, hope, equanimity, and post-traumatic growth before and after the intervention, as well as at the 2-month follow-up. The intervention consisted of a short (4-week) MiCBT program, which involved progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness of breath, body scanning, and the mindfulness-based interoceptive exposure task (MIET) for pain. The program was conducted over four consecutive weeks. RESULTS: Compared with the TAU group, at post-treatment, the MiCBT group experienced larger and significant reductions in pain (d = 1.58), psychological distress (d = .99), depression (d = 1.59), anxiety (d = 1.13), and stress (d = 1.68), as well as improvements in equanimity (d = 1.61), hope (d = 1.06), and post-traumatic growth (d = .6) (p's < .5). These differences remained significant at 2-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that a four-week MiCBT intervention can improve the daily experiences of women with BC undergoing chemotherapy. Further research using larger samples and active control is needed to determine the generalizability of the results."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally and the most common type of cancer in China, posing significant health and socio-economic challenges. Despite the effectiveness of psychological interventions for death anxiety, discussions around death are often avoided in China due to cultural taboos and neglect of end-of-life care. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of the self-designed end-of-life demands card game (ELDCG) and mindfulness-based cancer recovery program (MBCR) programs in alleviating death anxiety, anxiety, depression, and stress in patients with advanced lung cancer. METHODS: This was a randomized, single anonymized study. We randomly assigned 77 patients into two groups: the intervention group (38 patients) and the control group (39 patients). Routine health promotion was implemented in the intervention group, along with the ELDCG combined with the MBCR program, while the control group only received routine health promotion. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks. The intervention group completed the ELDCG within the first week, and the MBCR was completed during the remaining 5 weeks. The primary outcome was the Templer's Death Anxiety Scale (T-DAS) score, and the secondary outcomes were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score, the score on the Chinese version of the Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), and frequency of selection in the ELDCG. The assessment results of these scales were collected both before the intervention began and after the 6-week intervention period. The frequency of card selections was recorded after the ELDCG. RESULTS: After implementing the 6-week ELDCG and MBCR program, the intervention group showed significantly lower scores than the control group in death anxiety (p < 0.001), anxiety (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.001), and stress (p < 0.001). The card with the highest selection frequency (13 times) was \"I need the right to choose treatment options and understand the expected outcomes.\" CONCLUSION: The ELDCG might assist patients in emotionally coming to terms with death, while the MBCR offered potential strategies for managing stress. Together, they seemed to alleviate death anxiety and negative emotions by addressing these psychological factors, which in turn improves patients' ability to manage their illness. This improvement not only enhances their quality of life but also helps prevent the unnecessary consumption of healthcare resources, thus alleviating some of the financial strain on the healthcare system. Future research should assess the long-term effects and explore broader applications for terminally ill patients.

A pre-/post-intervention study was conducted to observe the changes in multifaceted self and mental health following an 8-week multi-site Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) targeting depression and anxiety disorders. Among the 24 participants, changes occurred across all outcome measures (i.e., trait mindfulness, anxiety, depression and self-compassion).

      "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough there are studies on preventing of COVID-19 infection for physical therapists during the COVID-19 pandemic, few studies have analyzed the job stress, depression, and mindfulness among physical therapists.ObjectiveThis study aimed to analyze workplace mental health such as personal characteristics, mindfulness, depression, and job stress, among physical therapists in Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsA survey was conducted among 280 physical therapists in Korea from December 2021 to January 2022 to collect demographic information and data on job stress, depression, and mindfulness. Frequency analysis, chi-square test, cross-tabulation, correlation analysis, and analysis of variance were conducted.ResultsThe participants exhibited a high-stress index regardless of the type of medical institution, age, and education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Job stress showed significant differences by marriage, education, work department, and depression. It was positively correlated with depression (r = 0.527, p < 0.001) and was higher among musculoskeletal physical therapists (F = 3.710, p < 0.01). Depression differed significantly by work period, job stress, and mindfulness. Although mindfulness differed significantly only by depression, it was negatively correlated with stress (r = -0.440, p < 0.001) and depression (r = -0.525, p < 0.001) and was higher among participants with graduate than undergraduate degrees (F = 3.751, p < 0.05).ConclusionsThe participants suffered from psychological instability and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, musculoskeletal physical therapists who mainly performed manual therapy exhibited higher job stress indexes compared to other divisions.",

      "abstract": "The high-pressure nature of clinical nursing work and workplace environments influence how nurses perceive fatigue and their physical and mental health. Therefore, promoting self-care-related skills and capabilities has become an important issue in nursing education. The concept of nurse self-care, the content of mindful self-compassion therapy, and how to apply this therapy in nurse self-care are introduced in this article. Based on the findings of prior empirical research, the concept of self-care in the context of nurses consists of three key abilities: mindfulness, self-compassion, and resilience. These abilities emphasize promoting the ability of nurses to be aware of their body-mind-spirit distress in the present and to respond to suffering with kindness and empathy. Furthermore, resilience may be developed even while facing adversities in life. Mindful self-compassion therapy has been increasingly applied in recent years to improve body-mind well-being in healthcare professionals. This therapy includes the concepts of mindfulness and self-compassion, self-compassion actions, how self-compassion can be applied to facing emotional difficulties, and practicing gratitude and savoring life for a life happiness. Empirical research results consistently confirm that mindful self-compassion therapy can effectively reduce both occupational and compassion fatigue. Therefore, mindfulness self-compassion skills incorporated into nurses' daily lives and work have been subsequently developed based on the concepts underlying mindful self-compassion therapy. These skills help nurses be more consciously aware of the personal impact of work stress, take ameliorative actions such as breathing exercises or body scanning to trigger a physical relaxation response, and use self-compassionate language to self-support.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer causes numerous physical complications and mental stress that negatively impact patients' performance and quality of life. This study examined the effects of mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MICBT) on depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality in women with breast cancer. A clinical trial design with pre-tests and post-tests and a two-month follow-up were used in the current study. The target population was women with breast cancer, 30 of whom were selected through purposeful sampling. Then, 15 participants were placed in the intervention group and 15 in the control group with four random blocks. Those in the intervention group received mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy, while those in the control group received self-help (an educational book). Demographic questionnaires, the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics such as frequency, mean and standard deviation, repeated measures ANOVA, and the Bonferroni test were used to analyze the data. The maximum alpha error level was considered 0.05 to test the hypotheses (p ≥ 0.05). The results showed the effectiveness of MICBT therapy on depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality (p < 0.05). The mean scores decreased in all variables, including from 15.47 ± 1.77 in the pre-test to 11.33 ± 4.25 in the post-test for depression, from 13.20 ± 2.60 in the pre-test to 8.67 ± 4.19 in the post-test for anxiety, from 19.73 ± 1.98 in the pre-test to 14.67 ± 2.69 in the post-test for stress and from 9.20 ± 1.74 in the pre-test to 5.07 ± 2.05 in the post-test for sleep quality. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that MICBT therapy is effective in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress and improving sleep quality in women with breast cancer. Therefore, it is recommended that affected women use psychological treatments such as MICBT in addition to medical treatments to deal with this stressful and challenging disease. MICBT can improve mood, offer a new cognitive and behavioral system, change patients' habits and thought patterns, and improve their lifestyle.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) is characterized by uncontrolled gaming behavior, leading to emotional distress, neglect of academic or life responsibilities, and damage to interpersonal relationships, all of which have serious negative impacts on individuals and society. IGD has been associated with neuropsychological impairments, especially executive function deficits, and emotional difficulties. Mindfulness interventions have been indicated to improve executive functions to varying degrees in individuals with IGD. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the three subcomponents of executive function (i.e., inhibition, updating, and shifting) are impaired in individuals with internet gaming disorder, as well as to examine the effectiveness of a brief mindfulness intervention on executive function. METHODS: A total of 82 individuals diagnosed with IGD and 40 non-addicted gamers will be recruited for this study. These participants will be evenly divided into an intervention group and a control group at a ratio of 1:1. The intervention group will undergo a 7-day mindfulness training program focusing on breathing meditation, while the control group will receive progressive muscle relaxation training. Both groups' outcomes will be assessed at seven different time points. Primary outcome measures will include electroencephalography (EEG) data (band power, functional connectivity, source localization, and N2/P3 amplitudes), behavioral metrics (response times and accuracy from psychological experimental paradigms), physiological indices (specifically heart rate variability), self-reported measures (game craving and mindfulness levels, executive function performance, and impulsivity emphasizing inhibitory control). Secondary outcome measures will encompass anxiety, stress, positive and negative affect, sleep quality, and other indicators such as demographic information, physical and mental health status, and the Big Five personality traits. DISCUSSION: This study aims to explore the efficacy of a brief mindfulness intervention on executive function impairments in IGD individuals and to elucidate its underlying neural mechanisms. It is anticipated that the findings will contribute to more targeted intervention strategies for executive function research, offering novel insights into the treatment of IGD and related cognitive dysfunctions. This study is expected to explore the effectiveness of brief mindfulness intervention on IGD and its underlying brain functional mechanisms, particularly providing more targeted intervention strategies for improving executive functions in this population.

However, the impact of childhood maltreatment on individuals' social mindfulness-an emerging form of \"effortless\" prosocial behavior-remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To address the gap in understanding the relationship between childhood maltreatment and social mindfulness, To address the gap in understanding the relationship between childhood maltreatment and social mindfulness, we conducted a cross-sectional study to clarify their association and explore potential influencing factors. METHODS: In this study, 611 undergraduates were surveyed to complete a series of questionnaires including Childhood Maltreatment questionnaire-28 item Short Form(CTQ-SF), 17-item Social Mindfulness Self-report Scale(SMSRS), Shyness Scale, Chinese Version of Word Sentence Association Paradigm for Hostility Scale(CV-WSAP-Hostility), Chinese Version of Self-Compassion Scale(CV-SCS). And a moderated mediation model was constructed based on the data results. RESULTS: Childhood maltreatment negatively predicts social mindfulness and exerts its influence through self-compassion as a mediator. Additionally, shyness and hostile attribution bias (HAB) were found to have significant independent and interactive moderating effects. Specifically, the negative impact of childhood maltreatment on self-compassion and social mindfulness diminished as levels of both shyness and HAB increased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the design of intervention programs for individuals with childhood maltreatment should fully consider the \"dual-edged sword\" effects of their shy personality traits and HAB and the potential for iatrogenic effects."

Breath-focused mindfulness meditation can reduce stress and anxiety, but trauma-exposed adults with dissociation have difficulty engaging in this practice. Our ongoing clinical trial examines if vibration-augmented breath-focused mindfulness (VABF) can improve outcomes and increase engagement. Here, we tested if VABF reduces respiration rate (RR) or respiration variability (RV), and examined associations between RR, RV, and emotion ratings. 128 trauma-exposed adults (mean age = 30.21 years) with elevated dissociation volunteered and completed at least 50 % of intervention visits. Participants were randomized to one of four mindfulness meditation interventions: VABF (n = 34); breath-focus only (n = 33); vibration only (n = 34); open awareness (no vibration or breath-focus, n = 27). Results from linear mixed-effects models showed that VABF decreased RV across visits while all the other interventions showed increased RV across visits (p = .008; ηp2 = .014), and RV was positively associated with both anxiety and anger ratings (ps < .001; rs > .125). Findings suggest RV is a meaningful metric for examining regulatory processes in clinical populations with elevated autonomic arousal and negative emotionality. They also show that RV is modifiable through VABF, which holds significant promise as an intervention to improve regulatory processes in trauma-exposed populations."

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a mindfulness-based contextual cognitive defusion training (M-bCCDT) program on perceived stress and other health outcomes, and to examine the reliable and clinically significance of these improvements at individual-level among older adults with MCI. DESIGN: A two-arm, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: 102 community-dwelling older adults with MCI. METHODS: Participants were randomly allocated to either a M-bCCDT program (weekly 60-minute sessions for 8 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of unsupervised practice) or health promotion classes. Measures of perceived stress, memory function, global cognitive function, psychomotor speed and mindfulness awareness were collected at baseline (T0), 8-week (T1) and 20-week (T2). Intervention effects were assessed at a group level (Generalized Estimating Equation, GEE) and individual level (Reliable and Clinically Significant Changes, RCSC). RESULTS: The M-bCCDT program demonstrated significant interaction effects in perceived stress compared to the wait-list control group by GEE analysis (βT1 = -3.686, 95% CI [-5.397, -1.976]; βT2 = -7.608, 95% CI [-9.387, -5.829]). Furthermore, this program also showed significant efficacy in memory function, psychomotor speed and mindfulness awareness. RCSC indicated that 30 participants (59%) in the intervention group showed statistically significant improvement in perceived stress at 8-week, with 7 (14%) clinically significant. This increased to 38 (75%) with 20 (39%) clinically significant at 20-week. Secondary outcomes also showed statistically and clinically significant improvements over time, but no improvement in global cognitive function at the individual level. CONCLUSIONS: The M-bCCDT program positively impacted perceived stress and mindfulness awareness in older adults with MCI, facilitating the improvements in memory and psychomotor speed, with these benefits sustained for 20 weeks. It offers a systematic approach for community healthcare providers in MCI stress management.",

A qualitative study used an iterative process guided by health behavior and mindfulness theories and feedback from a convenience sample of patients, endoscopy medical staff, and community members. Patient and medical staff (n = 18) were included in formative interviews (30-45 min), eight helped during intervention development sessions (15-90 min), and four community members reviewed the MBI in individual sessions (60 min). Interviews and sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using NVivo qualitative data software. Two themes emerged from the study: (1) both patients and medical staff reported that average-risk patients have pre-procedural anxiety before a first-time screening colonoscopy, and (2) using stakeholder-engaged strategies in an iterative process with both patients and medical staff is important so the developed intervention is acceptable to the priority population and to ensure medical accuracy and avoid disruption of workflow. Using an iterative process with key stakeholders is essential to develop interventions that are feasible and acceptable. The MBI developed through this process is being compared to usual care in a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine intervention feasibility and patient acceptability and to collect preliminary efficacy data. If efficacious, the developed MBI has the potential to reduce pre-procedural anxiety which may improve patient behaviors (e.g., bowel prep adherence and quality), patient satisfaction, and clinic workflow by reducing cancellation/no-shows, the amount of sedation required, and procedural time."

However, we lack research systematically examining what aspect(s) of meditation may drive such benefits. In particular, it is unknown how breathing patterns during meditation might influence health outcomes associated with AD. In this study, we examined whether two types of mindfulness meditation practices - one with slow breathing and one with normal breathing - differently affect plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) relative to a no-intervention control group. One week of daily mindfulness practice with slow breathing decreased plasma Aβ levels whereas one week of daily mindfulness practice with normal breathing increased them. The no-intervention control group showed no changes in plasma Aβ levels. Slow breathing appears to be a factor through which meditative practices can influence pathways relevant for AD."

Furthermore, people from historically marginalized communities are less likely to receive treatment, contributing to health inequities. Group mindfulness-based interventions improve pain and function, and virtual delivery has been demonstrated to be feasible. Little is known about how participants experience the virtual delivery of mindfulness-based interventions, especially participants from historically marginalized communities. OBJECTIVE: This study explored participant perspectives of a virtual mindfulness-based group medical visit for people with chronic low back pain. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the intervention arm of OPTIMUM, a study of virtual medical group visits using an adapted Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program for chronic low back pain. Semi-structured exit interviews were examined, and reflexive thematic analysis was used to compose key themes. RESULTS: Interviews from 59 participants (mean 56 years, 69.5% women; 45.8% Black or African American) were examined. Two major themes were derived from analysis. The first theme was 'effects of the external environment,' ie, the physical location from which the participant engaged with the session. The subthemes were comfort, social demands in the home setting, and sharing personal spaces. The second theme was 'navigating the virtual platform.' Subthemes were ease, struggle, and levels of support. CONCLUSION: Patient experiences varied substantially during the virtual mindfulness-based group medical visit intervention and this variation was influenced by social determinants of health. The key themes bring attention to the effects of the external environment and the technology itself on participation for people from historically marginalized communities. Basic tenets of mindfulness, such as present state awareness and equanimity, can provide a structure within which to navigate virtual participation amid home environments. Future studies are needed to explore differences in virtual and in-person mindfulness programs and to adapt virtual mindfulness programs. CLINICALTRIALSGOV ID NUMBER: NCT04129450."

This study aimed to investigate MBI-induced weekly changes and long-term effects in trait mindfulness and psychological symptoms. METHOD: This study analyzed longitudinal data from a mechanistic clinical trial in which young adults (aged 21-35) with ACE were randomized to an 8-week MBI or an active control condition of Stress Management Education (SME), with 21 and 19 completers respectively. Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (KSQ) were administered before, after, and weekly during the 8-week interventions, and at 6-, 12-, and 18-months follow-up. Data analyses were conducted with linear mixed effects models, Granger causality and Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM). RESULTS: Group by time interaction effects were observed with PSS, MAAS, KSQ-depression, KSQ-hostility, and KSQ-anxiety with small effect sizes. Only in the MBI group, increases of MAAS scores predicted reductions of PSS, KSQ-somatization, and KSQ-hostility scores. MAAS score reached significant increase at the end of MBI, and most MBI-induced symptom reduction lasted 12 months without refresher courses. CONCLUSIONS: MBI demonstrated unique effects of trait mindfulness improvement leading to psychological symptom reductions. At least 8 weeks of MBI program duration and refreshment at 12 months may be necessary for ACE survivors. PREREGISTRATION: This study is not preregistered."

      "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may be a valuable method for reducing internalizing symptoms in autistic individuals. The current study extends this work using an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 study. In this parallel randomized controlled trial, we examined a novel telehealth intervention for autistic adolescents and their caregivers. MINDful TIME includes eight weekly group meetings and regular use of a commercially available mindfulness meditation app. Participants were 42 adolescent-parent dyads randomized to the treatment or delayed treatment control (DTC) group. The program was implemented with fidelity (91.24%-94.78%), and 90% of treatment group dyads completed the program. On average, participants attended >90% of sessions and reported high acceptability. Treatment group adolescents demonstrated statistically and clinically significant reductions in parent-reported depression symptoms relative to DTC (F(1, 34) = 7.31, p = 0.01, ηp2 = 0.18). Female adolescents in the treatment group showed significant reductions in parent-reported anxiety symptoms (F(1, 34) = 4.22, p = 0.05, ηp2 = 0.11). Exploratory analyses indicated treatment-related improvements in adolescent executive functioning, parent mindfulness and well-being, and adolescent-parent relationship dysfunction. Findings warrant future examination of MINDful TIME to address well-documented challenges with mental health in this population. This trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05685589).Lay abstractPrevious research studies have found that mindfulness (i.e. focused attention on, and acceptance of, the present moment) training programs can reduce stress, depression, and anxiety. However, more research is needed to understand whether mindfulness strategies are helpful for autistic teens. We examined a new telehealth intervention for autistic teens and their caregivers. MINDful TIME is an 8-week group program that meets weekly through Zoom meetings. Participants learn mindfulness strategies through didactic lessons and using a commercially available mindfulness meditation mobile app. We randomly assigned 42 teens (ages 13-18 years) with an autism diagnosis and their parents to complete MINDful TIME or an 8-week wait period before beginning the program. Ninety percent of teens and parents assigned to MINDful TIME completed the program and reported that they found the program to be acceptable. Teens who completed MINDful TIME showed large reductions in depression symptoms, whereas teens in the wait period group did not. Females who completed MINDful TIME also showed reductions in anxiety symptoms, whereas males who completed MINDful TIME and females and males in the wait period group did not. Parents who completed MINDful TIME with their teens showed increased mindfulness traits, well-being, and adolescent-parent relationship functioning. Findings suggest that MINDful TIME is a promising program that may improve accessibility of mindfulness strategies for autistic teens and their caregivers. Future research with a larger sample size is needed to fully understand the benefits of the program."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and test the effectiveness of the eBEfree program, a 12-session app-based version of a previously tested psychological intervention (BEfree) that combines psycho-education, self-compassion, mindfulness, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to reduce binge-eating symptoms. METHOD: Two-hundred participants with recurrent elevated binge-eating symptoms and a higher body weight were enrolled in a remote parallel-group randomized trial, of which 142 completed the initial assessment (70 in the intervention group). The end-of-treatment and follow-up assessments were conducted 12 weeks after the initial assessment and 26 weeks after the end of treatment, respectively. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyzes were undertaken using frequentist linear mixed models and Bayesian hierarchical models to test the intervention effectiveness. RESULTS: 43 (waitlist control) and 29 (intervention) participants completed the end-of-treatment assessment, showing a high attrition rate (51%). ITT analyzes showed the eBEfree program to be associated with a significant reduction in binge eating symptomatology from baseline to end-of-treatment (β = -9.49, ρ < 0.0001, g = -1.17), and from end-of-treatment to 26-weeks follow-up (β = -6.01, ρ = 0.04, g = -1.08). At end-of-treatment, the intervention was also associated with a decrease in body mass index and depression symptomatology, as well as an improvement in dimensions of self-criticism and mindfulness. More than 80% of participants rated the quality of the program as positive and helpful. DISCUSSION: This trial suggests potential benefits of the eBEfree program to help individuals manage symptoms of binge-eating more effectively, reduce weight, and improve well-being and mental health. The intervention benefits should be confirmed in future larger trials. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Treating binge-eating (BE) symptoms and associated comorbidities might be challenging for mental health services. Digital and app-based interventions can be a valuable resource to help people manage symptoms and improve well-being and mental health. The current trial suggests the potential benefits of an app-based intervention (eBEfree program) to help people reduce BE symptoms and develop psychological strategies to promote well-being and mental health.

Recent technological advances have made EEG acquisition more accessible and also reliable. EEG monitoring before, during, and after treatment might support efficacy assessment and enable real- time adaptive intervention. The preliminary research extracted 131 papers from 6 scientific search engines. The application of the exclusion criteria led to the selection of 4 papers, indicating that the topic is still unexplored and further investigations are required. The collected papers exhibited great variability making challenging the comparison, nevertheless promising EEG correlates emerged. In particular, pain-related evoked potentials correlate with Mindfulness-Based treatment. EEG source analysis revealed the prevalent involvement of regions modulating emotional responses. In addition, higher baseline theta power was associated with greater improvement in depression when Mindfulness-based treatments are administered. This last result makes EEG also suitable for evaluating which patients can benefit most from mindfulness-based treatments."

METHOD: Ten electronic databases were searched from inception to October 2024 including Ovid Medline, CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, APA PsycINFO, Age line, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete, and ScienceDirect. We reviewed studies on quality of sleep outcomes for patients with cancer receiving mindfulness-based interventions based on Buddhist teaching. We only reviewed randomized controlled trials written in English. A random-effects model was used to compute the effect size. We used Funnel plot, Q statistics, and I2 to test the heterogeneity across studies. Also, we examined moderators to explore sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Across 25 included studies providing 26 comparisons (N = 2263), 1157 cancer patients participated in mindfulness interventions; 1106 served as controls. Most cancer patients were males (s = 14). Mean age ranged from 39.02 to 70.86 yrs. (Mean = 53.70, SD = 6.52). Overall, MBIs had a moderate effect on improving quality of sleep among cancer patients (g = 0.598, 95 %CI 0.332, 0.864, p < .001, I2 = 88 %). Funding and time of outcome measure were moderators affecting ES. No primary studies reported the adverse effects. CONCLUSION: MBIs significantly improved quality of sleep among patients with cancer. Clinicians should consider using MBIs as alternative complementary treatment for improving quality of sleep among patients with cancer.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Antenatal depression and perceived stress are prevalent mental health challenges faced by pregnant women, and they are associated with male child preference. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a modified mindfulness training program for reducing antenatal depression and perceived stress levels among expectant mothers with a male child preference at a public sector tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Material and Methods: The present feasibility trial was conducted among expectant mothers with antenatal depression and perceived stress with a male child preference using the ADAPT-ITT framework. Assessments of the needs and experiences of the new target population were carried out through an exploratory and descriptive qualitative study. In-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide and analyzed using a thematic analysis process. Repeated-measures MANOVA was employed to investigate the effect of time on antenatal depression and perceived stress scores in the feasibility of the intervention. Results: Five major themes emerged from the qualitative data. A significant influence of time was established on the antenatal depression scores, with perceived scores of F (2, 326) = 21.244, p < 0.001, and F (2, 326) = 310.748, p < 0.001. The antenatal depression scores significantly decreased from pre-intervention to post-intervention (mean difference = 4.00, p < 0.001), and there was a slightly significant decline from post-intervention to follow-up (mean difference = 1.167, p = 0.001). The perceived stress scores were significantly reduced from pre-intervention to post-intervention (mean difference = 10.214, p < 0.001), and there was a minor but significant decline from post-intervention to follow-up (mean difference = 0.333, p = 0.043). Conclusions: This study concludes that the modified mindfulness training program is a culturally suitable, contextually relevant intervention in the context of Pakistan and it significantly reduced antenatal depression and perceived stress in expectant mothers with a male child preference. The modified mindfulness training program was modified in accordance with the context of Islamic teaching regarding health-promoting lifestyles and religious spirituality."

      "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health challenges among children and adolescents in South Korea have intensified with rising rates of depression and suicide. Proactive interventions focusing on mental well-being are needed to address this critical issue. This study examines the effectiveness of the Mindfulness-based Social-Emotional Growth (MSEG) program for enhancing the mental health of elementary school students in Korea. This quasi-experimental study evaluated the impact of the MSEG program on students at an elementary school in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. A total of 70 students (35 from lower grades [grades 1-3] and 35 from upper grades [grades 4-6]) participated in the 12-week intervention group, while 72 students were in the control group. Pre- and post-intervention assessments measured social-emotional, mindfulness, and clinical domains. The findings revealed significant improvements in emotional regulation across all grades. Lower-grade students showed substantially reduced anxiety and depression, while upper-grade students demonstrated enhanced resilience compared to the control group. These results indicate the potential of the MSEG program to promote early mental health when integrated into elementary school curricula. Further research is needed to adapt the program to diverse educational settings and optimize its effectiveness and impact."

      "abstract": "Background. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have emerged as an alternative intervention for symptoms of psychological and psychiatric conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and emotional discomfort. Over the last ten years, MBIs have established a growing body of evidence that shows cognitive and neurophysiological benefits. Depression and anxiety are conditions with a high prevalence in the world population. In developing countries, it is reported that, given the conditions of being at a social disadvantage, anxiety and depression are higher, resulting in compromised psychological well-being and mental health. Objectives. This systematic review aims to quantitatively and qualitatively assess changes in the neuropsychological, particularly executive functioning and social cognition domains, and electroencephalographical (EEG) effects of MBIs. Methods. A systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) in three databases, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO MedLine complete; 14,464 articles were found, 141 articles evaluated the effects of MBI on executive functioning, and 16 included both as in qualitative and quantitative variables. Results. The qualitative results show that the research on the effects of MBI on behavior and cognitive skills, including executive function, social cognition, and EEG analysis, is very scarce but consistent in suggesting strong correlations on cognitive and electrophysiological alpha-beta proportions asymmetry on frontal areas. Undoubtedly, executive functions, as a behavioral regulatory and self-monitoring system, are the most popular study of interest in the literature, including emotional regulation, awareness, planning, social skills, and focused attention. Although there are fewer studies assessing the effects of MBIs on social cognition skills. The funnel plot showed a symmetrical distribution but ranked out of significant correlation. Most estimates of treatment effects are positive (58%); however, the average outcome observed did not significantly differ from zero. Conclusions. This study concludes that the research integrating the analysis of the electrophysiological and executive function effects of MBI shows important methodological variations and clinical conditions, which explains the significant results reported individually. Even when most of the literature reports positive effects of MBIs on several behavioral and neurophysiological domains, there are still confounding factors that must be taken into consideration by researchers and clinicians before attributing possible inaccurate or generalizable benefits."

Although efficacious psychological treatments for SIAD exist, they are generally underutilized and inaccessible. eSense is a feasible and useable online intervention containing Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness-Based Therapy (MBT) programs. Our goal was to test the efficacy of the CBT and MBT arms of eSense relative to a waitlist control condition. METHOD: Women with SIAD were randomized to eSense-CBT (n = 43), eSense-MBT (n = 43), or a waitlist (n = 43). Both interventions consisted of 8 modules with a recommended completion time of 8-12 weeks. Participants also met remotely with non-expert \"navigators\" for up to 12 weeks. Participants completed validated self-report measures of primary outcomes (sexual desire/arousal and distress) and secondary outcomes (sexual satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and overall sexual function) at baseline, mid-treatment, posttreatment, and 6-month posttreatment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared to waitlist, both active treatment groups reported significant improvements in primary outcomes at post-treatment (desire/arousal d > .90; sexual distress d < -0.62) and these improvements were generally maintained at follow-up. The two active treatments did not differ in terms of primary outcomes. Effects on sexual satisfaction were also significant (d = 0.70-0.81) and MBT resulted in slightly greater improvements. There was no effect on sexual dissatisfaction. For overall sexual function, the effect was large (d = 1.20 to 1.23) with no between-arm differences. Future steps to improve engagement and increase access are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Internet gaming disorder (IGD) affects 3% of the global population and poses an increasing risk due to advancements in technology. However, there is currently no definitive treatment for this condition. IGD is not a primary disorder but rather a result of \"self-prescription\" in response to emotional stressors. Unlike conventional mental health treatments that focus on the disorder itself, it is crucial to provide alternative activities that can alleviate negative emotions. This paper extends the concept of the self-medication hypothesis and integrates it with cognitive models of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. In addition, it introduces the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy-game (MBCT-G), a program designed to explore alternative activities through gaming, focusing on the processes of response and reward, which are not typically emphasized in traditional treatments. This study serves as the theoretical foundation for the development of MBCT-G. MBCT-G aims to train individuals in positive coping strategies that alleviate psychological distress, offering a novel approach to treating self-prescription disorders such as IGD.",

Some treatment barriers include poor illness insight, low body dysmorphic disorder awareness among mental health professionals and a lack of accessibility to body dysmorphic disorder-specific treatments. Currently available treatments for body dysmorphic disorder, including psychopharmacology and psychotherapy, show modest results in improving body dysmorphic disorder symptoms. With the reduced quality of life and increased risks of suicide among individuals with body dysmorphic disorder, there is a need for new and easily accessible therapeutic approaches specific to body dysmorphic disorder. Emerging research has suggested that mindfulness-based interventions show promise as an addition to available body dysmorphic disorder treatments. Clinical evidence of mindfulness-based interventions demonstrates efficacy in improving symptoms in eating disorders, social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, conditions that have similar clinical presentations as body dysmorphic disorder. Mindfulness strategies, such as increasing interoceptive awareness, non-judgement and non-reactivity, are also suggested to reduce body image disturbances, anxiety and repetitive thoughts, and cognitive rigidity, clinical characteristics of body dysmorphic disorder. This perspective piece aims to provide evidences for integrating mindfulness into treatment protocols to support mental health professionals better address the challenges faced by individuals with body dysmorphic disorder.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research method was a three-stage, three-group semiexperimental design. To this end, the statistical population including all the employees who worked in the technical departments of Tam Kar Company in Isfahan and in terms of the level of stress in middle and higher levels, using purposive sampling, 60 employees were selected and randomly divided into three groups (20 for each group). Geldard (1989) burnout inventory (GBI) was used for data collection. Experimental group 1 received eight 90-min sessions of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy training, and experimental group 2 received job stress coping training in ten 90-min sessions. Repeated measurement ANOVA was used to analyze the data with the help of a statistical software package in social sciences (SPSS) version 22. RESULTS: The results showed that coping with job stress training and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy were equally effective in reducing the employees' burnout (P ≤ 0.05) and this effect continued at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of burnout and psychopathologic symptoms among industry staff, coping with job stress training and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy training can be suggested to reduce burnout syndrome in the industry."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Experiences of difficulty (e.g., anxiety, difficult emotions) can occur during mindfulness practice. This study characterized the occurrence of such difficulties, defined as abnormal distress, dysregulation or agitation, among high suicide risk participants during a mindfulness-based intervention. The study also evaluated whether mindfulness difficulties were associated with baseline differences or poorer outcomes during follow-up. METHOD: Participants (n=50; mean age=49 years, 84% male, 24% Latinx) were from the Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (MBCT-S) trial. Occurrences of mindfulness difficulties were identified via systematic review of progress notes. Serious clinical outcomes (suicidal events, suicide attempts, and psychiatric hospitalizations) were tracked over 12-months follow-up. Participants experiencing difficulties during MBCT-S were compared to those who did not on baseline characteristics and serious clinical outcomes. Incidence density sampling and Cox proportional regression analyses tested whether experiencing difficulties during mindfulness increased the risk of subsequent serious clinical outcomes. RESULTS: 18% of participants had difficulty during mindfulness practice, which mostly included experiences of anxiety or hallucinations. Those experiencing difficulty showed several diagnostic differences at baseline, but were not at significantly greater risk of a suicidal event, HR 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14 - 2.71) or an acute psychiatric hospitalization, HR 0.85 (95% CI: 0.19 - 3.82). There were no suicide attempts among the 9 participants who experienced mindfulness difficulty, compared to 5 suicide attempts in those without mindfulness difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: Difficulties during mindfulness practice were common, but did not show increased risk of serious clinical outcomes in participants at high-risk of suicide. PREREGISTRATION: This study reports findings from a secondary analyses of a randomized clinical trial that was preregistered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01872338)."

However, the effectiveness of such interventions in preschool-aged children remains underexplored.Purpose: This study aimed to assess the effect of a one-week mindfulness-based intervention on resilience, social behavior, and motor skills in four to five-year-old children.Research Design: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of the intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a mindfulness group (MG), a physical activity group (PAG), and a control group (CG).Study Sample: The study sample consisted of 45 children (22 females; 23 males; M age = 4.5, SD = 0.4 years) from the same preschool.Data Collection and/or Analysis: Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: (a) a mindfulness group (MG; n = 15) that participated in five 30-min mindfulness sessions; (b) a physical activity group (PAG; n = 15) that engaged in five 45-min physical exercise sessions; and (c) a control group (CG; n = 15) that received no intervention. Training sessions were held on five consecutive days. Assessments were conducted before (T0) and after (T1) the intervention using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (to assess motor skills), the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (to evaluate behavior), and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure-28 (to measure resilience).Results: At baseline (T0), there were no significant differences between the groups. After the intervention (T1), the mindfulness group experienced the strongest positive effects, with significant improvements in motor skills and social behavior, although there was no significant effect on resilience.Conclusions: Our results suggest that a brief mindfulness training intervention is a promising strategy for improving motor skills and social behavior in early childhood settings, though it did not significantly affect resilience."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Effective interventions are needed to reduce caregiver burden and stress, particularly among family caregivers of veterans with dementia. Unique risk factors such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) further complicate caregiving. This study compares a four-session mindfulness-based multicomponent intervention (PAACC) with a cognitive behavioral intervention (REACH), both designed to alleviate caregiver burden, and provides a baseline evaluation of caregivers in the intervention. A two-arm, blinded, randomized controlled trial assigned 133 dementia caregivers to PAACC (n = 67) or REACH (n = 66). Baseline assessments included caregiver stress, burden, mindfulness receptivity, rumination, compassion, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and care recipient behavior. Participants averaged 67.17 years, 85% were women, and 70% were spousal caregivers. Caregivers in PAACC reported higher depressive symptoms and anxiety and lower mindfulness receptivity. This study introduces the first mindfulness-based intervention for veteran caregivers, designed to enhance cognitive flexibility, cultivate compassion, and provide practical skills to improve quality of life. METHODS: The study utilized a two-arm, blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial to compare the PAACC and REACH interventions. A total of 133 dementia caregivers experiencing moderate to severe caregiver burden were assigned to receive either the PAACC intervention (n = 67) or the REACH intervention (n = 66). Baseline evaluations included caregiver stress, burden, mindfulness receptivity, rumination, compassion, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and the memory and behavior problems of the veteran living with dementia, using widely accepted measures from caregiving literature. RESULTS: Baseline assessments were conducted on 133 family caregivers of veterans living with dementia. The average caregiver age was 67.17 years (SD = 9.8), 85% were women, and 70% were spousal caregivers. No significant demographic differences were found between the two intervention groups. However, baseline comparisons showed that caregivers in the PAACC intervention reported higher depressive symptoms and anxiety, and lower mindfulness receptivity. A detailed protocol for the mindfulness-based multicomponent caregiver intervention PAACC is described. DISCUSSION: There is a growing need for multicomponent, skill-building interventions tailored for dementia caregivers who are at high risk of stress. This study introduces the first mindfulness-based intervention specifically for caregivers of veterans, designed to enhance cognitive flexibility, cultivate compassion, and equip caregivers with practical skills to improve their quality of life. HIGHLIGHTS: PAACC is a mindfulness-based multicomponent intervention for dementia caregivers of veterans.No demographic differences suggest psychological differences are not due to demographics.Baseline mental health and mindfulness readiness may impact intervention effectiveness."

      "abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are increasingly used in clinical and community settings and show significant potential to address a broad range of physical and mental health outcomes. This potential has led to calls for ever greater implementation of MBIs internationally, particularly with vulnerable populations and in low-resource settings. However, the effectiveness of MBIs has not been unequivocally demonstrated across populations, contexts, and health outcomes, with some studies failing to show treatment effects or even showing iatrogenic effects. Simultaneously, health care and public health systems globally struggle to address population health needs within a medical paradigm that, in general, individualizes pathology while obscuring the structural causes of health disparities. It is therefore critical to note that most research and practice in the mindfulness space have focused on change processes exclusively at the individual level. In populations lacking access to basic needs such as physical safety, food, shelter, social support, health care, education, and financial stability, change processes at the individual level do not adequately address the conditions that impact human development and produce disease. In this article, we make a call to action urging MBI implementers in global health to (a) center community ownership; (b) attend to inequities in power both within communities and between researchers and communities; (c) engage cross-sector networks of community stakeholders to identify resources, resiliencies, and areas of most urgent need; (d) address community-defined needs and change processes at multiple social-ecological levels; and (e) incorporate complementary interventions that address both basic needs and the social drivers of human development and disease. Drawing on developments in implementation science, social science, and community practice, we provide guidance on directions and methods for future work to achieve these ends. Using this guidance, researchers and interventionists may catalyze the development of a community-owned, materially engaged, relational model of MBI, which has the potential to effect positive social change.

This pilot study explored the effects of an SMBI program on anxiety, depression, mindfulness, emotional awareness, executive functioning, and school well-being among French primary school students (mean age = 116 months; SD = 9.06). Methods: A quasi-experimental longitudinal design was employed, with assessments at pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2), and follow-up (T3). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Results: The study found no statistically significant changes across all assessed dimensions. The lack of significant results may reflect factors such as the program's duration, small sample size, reliance on self-report measures, and contextual challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. However, slight numerical trends in anxiety and mindfulness scores suggest potential benefits that larger studies may better detect. Conclusions: While no significant improvements were observed, the findings highlight important considerations for SMBI implementation in schools in France and internationally. Future research should address current limitations by increasing sample sizes, employing multi-informant assessments, and integrating SMBIs with complementary approaches, such as social-emotional learning. Extending the program duration or incorporating booster sessions may enhance effectiveness. Embedding SMBIs into school curricula through a whole-school approach could foster the sustainable and impactful integration of mindfulness practices into daily school life."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Young sexual minority adults experience high rates of heterosexist discrimination. The use of substances has been documented as a form of coping with discrimination. While mindfulness has been used to address experiences of discrimination and the use of substances, respectively, few studies have explored whether mindfulness can lower the negative effects of discrimination on substance use. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between heterosexist discrimination and substance use in young adult sexual minority men (YASMM), and if dispositional mindfulness can moderate this relationship. METHODS: Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association of heterosexist discrimination and cigarette, e-cigarette, and hazardous drinking in a sample of YASMM (18-35 years old; n = 325) from a national survey. A two-way interaction analysis was also implemented to evaluate if dispositional mindfulness moderated this relationship. RESULTS: Heterosexist discrimination was associated with increased odds of cigarette use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 1.08) and e-cigarette use (aOR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.05). Higher scores of dispositional mindfulness moderated the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and hazardous drinking, indicating a weakening effect with higher scores of dispositional mindfulness. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness may decrease the negative effects of heterosexist discrimination on hazardous drinking among YASMM.Health Equity Implications: Researchers and practitioners should consider incorporating mindfulness as a component to their intervention to help YASMM deal with stressors engendered by discrimination, which may prevent hazardous drinking as a coping mechanism at a younger age."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physical exercises and mindfulness are important components in the management of chronic pain, but pain may reduce exercise adherence. Virtual reality (VR) can provide cognitive inhibition of the ascending pain signal and may thus be a tool for the delivery of pain management during exercise interventions. In this study we assessed a VR-guided intervention seeking to improve physical fitness in individuals with chronic pain. METHODS: Participants in rehabilitation for chronic pain were included in a randomised controlled pilot trial with a cross-over design. In counter-balanced order participants were asked to perform, five minutes of aerobic exercise following identical instructions given through either a VR headset or television (TV) screen. The procedures were then repeated with mindfulness exercises. Heart rate (HR) was monitored throughout all four sessions and participants self-reported perceived exercise intensity, benefit, relaxation, and reward. Paired Student's t-test, Wilcoxon signed rank test and McNemar's test were performed to compare the outcome variables across sessions for individuals, as appropriate. (Clinical trial registration NCT06611566 09.09.24, retrospectively registered). RESULTS: Twenty-seven participants were included in the study. The mean age (SD) was 40.4 (11.3) years, and 17 (63%) were men. Mean HR, the proportion of time spent at moderate-vigorous exercise intensity levels, and all self-reported measurements were comparable between the VR vs. TV sessions. No major adverse events were reported. The physiological and perceived exercise outputs of aerobic exercises were thus similar across modes of delivery (VR vs. TV) in individuals with chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the possibilities of VR-guided interventions in the pain management of individuals with chronic pain with comparable levels of exertion to TV-guided exercise and few adverse events. The promise of VR-guided mindfulness in the rehabilitation of patients with chronic pain conditions is also confirmed."

Non-pharmacological approaches for improving the mental health of pregnant women are increasingly needed in public health. BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions are among the most promising approaches to improving mental health. AIM: This study aimed to 1) develop a short online Japanese version of the mindfulness-based childbirth and parenting programme, and 2) investigate its effectiveness in improving mental health after intervention and birth. METHODS: A pre- and post-test study was conducted in Japan from February to October 2021 on a single group of 37 healthy pregnant women (16-34 gestational weeks). The four-week online mindfulness-based childbirth and parenting programme included psychoeducation based on mindfulness practices and the physiological processes of pregnancy and childbirth. Participants self-reported their evaluations of mindfulness, self-esteem, subjective happiness, sense of coherence, depression, stress, anxiety, and fear of childbirth before and after the programme (response rate: 97.4 %). The pre- and post-intervention responses were compared using a paired t-test. RESULTS: The results showed a significant reduction in perceived stress and fear of childbirth and an increase in mindfulness, self-esteem, and subjective happiness. No significant effects were observed in this low-risk population with regard to perinatal depression, anxiety, or sense of coherence. CONCLUSION: The newly developed condensed version of the mindfulness-based childbirth and parenting programme significantly improved maternal mental health. Further studies are required to clarify its effectiveness in larger and more diverse samples of pregnant women.",

The DHI, CFQ, PHQ-9, GAD-7, VM-PATHI, and PROMIS scores all improved significantly after MBSR treatment compared to prior to treatment (all questionnaires, p<0.01 except for CFQ; p=0.03). Mean daily vertigo scores did not change significantly over time in the 24-day lead-in period (adjusted r2 = 0.03; p=0.54) but decreased significantly over the eight-week MBSR treatment period (adjusted r2 = 0.32; p<0.001). Conclusions In this non-controlled, prospective pilot study, a MBSR program was highly effective for decreasing dizziness burden and improving measures of quality of life in subjects with VM.

METHOD: The study was conducted with 34 women who were about to start in vitro fertilization (IVF) and met the inclusion criteria. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 17) or the control group (n = 17) using random number sequences generated on \" http://www.random.org . This process accounted for potential participant loss and was implemented in the order of participation. When cases withdrew, new participants were assigned based on the random sequence. All participants were women over the age of 18, literate, and users of smartphones. The experimental group used the IVFmind mobile application, specially developed for this study to facilitate mindfulness practices for infertility treatment. Psychosocial status was assessed using the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale, Infertility Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form, Infertility Adjustment Scale, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Data were collected through pre-tests and post-tests, and statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of socio-demographic characteristics and infertility-related factors (p > 0.05). Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale: No significant difference was found between groups in the pre-test scores (U = 120,000, p = 0.398). However, post-test scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group (U = 0.000, p < 0.001). Infertility Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form: No significant difference was found between groups in the pre-test scores (U = 125,500, p = 0.503). In the post-test, the experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group (U = 0.000, p < 0.001). Infertility Adjustment Scale: Pre-test scores showed no significant differences between the groups (U = 106,500, p = 0.184). In the post-test, the experimental group had significantly lower scores compared to the control group, indicating better adjustment (U = 3,000, p < 0.001). Depression Anxiety Stress Scale: There was no significant difference between the groups in the pre-test scores (U = 141,000, p = 0.904). However, post-test scores of the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the control group (U = 56,500, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The mindfulness-based mobile application positively impacted the psychosocial status of women undergoing infertility treatment, demonstrating significant improvements. The experimental group showed notable increases in mindfulness, self-efficacy, and adjustment levels, along with significant reductions in depression and anxiety. These results highlight the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in addressing psychological challenges associated with infertility and suggest that mobile applications can be a valuable tool for supporting mental health in this context.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction focuses on increasing awareness and acceptance of moment-to-moment experiences including difficult emotions and physical discomfort. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a Mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention on the functional and psychosocial outcomes of Long-COVID patients. DESIGN: A two-arm randomized controlled trial with repeated-measures design. SETTING: Department of Anesthesia and critical care. PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 survivors (105 patients). METHODS: The patients were randomly allocated to either psychoeducation (intervention group) or usual care (control group) (53 vs 52 patients per group). A Mindfulnes program was implemented in the intervention group included an 8-week Mindfulnes-program (2 hours per week) in a group format. Study outcomes included Chronic pain (pain intensity and pain interference) assessed with Brief Pain Inventory (primary outcomes), Anxiety and Depression assessed with Hospital anxiety and depression scale, Insomnia assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index. Data were collected at 6 month and 12 months after Mindfulness-program. RESULTS: A reduction in pain intensity and pain interference on some activities of daily living were observed 6 and 12 months after intervention. A statistically significant difference emerged in the mean score of symptoms of anxiety in favor of the intervention group (11.28 vs 13.15, t= -3.636, p< .001) at 6 month and at 12 months (10.88 vs 13.41, t= -5.167, p< .001) and in the mean score of the symptoms of depression in favor of the intervention group (9.95 vs 11.23, t= -2.823, p= .007) at 6 month and at 12 months (9.67 vs 10.69, t= -2.458, p= .018). Symptoms of insomnia were statistically reduced 6 months after the Mindfulness-program (score: 53.2 vs 30.4, x= 4.944, p= .026). CONCLUSIONS: In light of what emerged from our study, we suggest a Mindfulness program in addition to drug therapy to be carried out once a year on patients with consequences of COVID-19. Studies with larger sample sizes that attempt to test a Mindfulness-program twice a year are needed.",

      "abstract": "This article delves into the research conducted by Liu DW et al on the integration of mindfulness-based stress reduction training (MSRT) and flavored Jinshui Liujun decoction (FJLD) with conventional chemotherapy (CC) in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The study investigates the impact of this combined approach on immune function and emotional well-being of non-small cell lung cancer patients. Patients were divided into a control group (CG) receiving CC alone and a treatment group (TG) receiving MSRT + FJLD alongside CC. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival and overall survival, with secondary outcomes including Karnofsky performance status scores, clinical efficacy, immune function markers, and emotional state assessments. The findings underscore significant improvements in median progression-free survival (20.50 months in TG vs 13.10 months in CG, P < 0.05), Karnofsky performance status scores (60 in TG vs 50 in CG, P < 0.05), and immune cell ratios, along with reductions in negative emotions (self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale scores significantly lower in TG, P < 0.05) among patients receiving MSRT + FJLD in conjunction with CC. This article highlights the potential of combining traditional Chinese medicine and modern psychological interventions to enhance the efficacy of conventional cancer treatments and improve patient outcomes."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: With raising rates of mental health problems, mind-body interventions are increasingly being integrated in schools to support children and adolescents' mental health and well-being. The aim of this study was to explore young adolescents' experiences of yoga and mindfulness and the acceptability of delivery within the school curriculum in an area of high deprivation. DESIGN: Qualitative group interviews with young adolescents embedded within a larger feasibility study exploring the universal (class-wide) delivery of yoga and mindfulness interventions. METHODS: After participation in separate 10-week yoga or mindfulness interventions, 45 adolescents (12-13 years old; 66.7% male) took part in semi-structured group interviews exploring perceptions, acceptability, and experiences of each intervention. Data was analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two overarching themes were identified, evident across both mindfulness and yoga groups. \"Facilitators and barriers to engagement\" outlined key factors impacting acceptability, including prior perceptions. Teacher qualities of non-reactivity and respect, an invitational approach to teaching, and interactive sessions were highly valued. Secondly, participants described a range of \"psychosocial impacts\", including increased emotional regulation, positive mindset and self-confidence, and greater focus and concentration. Physical benefits were also reported in the yoga group. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to explore the acceptability and impact of universal yoga and mindfulness interventions with an ethnically diverse sample of disadvantaged young adolescents in the United Kingdom. The findings suggest mind-body interventions can help children and adolescents develop skills to better manage challenges in their everyday lives, but they require further integration into the curriculum for optimal benefit.",

Using a randomized controlled design, 185 participants from Prolific completed a brief two-week mindfulness intervention, with one pre- and two post-intervention measures. While the intervention effects were limited, the findings reveal that mindfulness is positively and similarly associated with both SWB and PWB, with stronger indirect links to PWB via PsyCap. While both measures of mindfulness had similar relationships with all outcomes, the multidimensional FFMQ offered additional insights, identifying the \"describing\" facet as particularly influential for both SWB and PWB, informing new potential paths for theorizing and practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Very preterm (VPT) adolescents show executive and socio-emotional difficulties that persist into adulthood. Beneficial effect of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) has been found in VPT young adolescents immediately after the end of the intervention. This study aims to examine the long-term effects of an 8-week MBI (2 to 5 years after the completion of the 8-week MBI) on executive and socio-emotional competencies in VPT adolescents. METHODS: The 'Mindful Preterm Teens - Follow-Up' study included 21 VPT adolescents, born before 32 weeks of gestation, who had previously completed the MBI, as well as 22 VPT and 28 full-term adolescents (aged 13 to 18) who had never participated in an MBI. Executive and socio-emotional competencies were assessed using self- and parent-reported questionnaires, as well as using neuropsychological testing. Past and current mindfulness practices were collected via self- and parent-questionnaires. Pearson's correlations were used to explore associations between current mindfulness practice and outcome measures, and group differences in outcome scores were analysed using multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). RESULTS: In VPT adolescents who had previously completed the MBI, current mindfulness practice was generally infrequent (ranging from at least once per month to no practice). This group showed a significant association between lower levels of current mindfulness practice with reduced parent-rated anxiety. When comparing the group of VPT adolescents who had completed the MBI with both VPT and FT participants who had not, no significant differences were observed in executive and socio-emotional competencies. CONCLUSIONS: We observed no significant effect of MBI on the long-term (i.e., 2 to 5 years after the end of the MBI) in VPT adolescents. Regular mindfulness pratice might be needed to maintain the immediate beneficial effect of MBI.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To inform and improve future program development, particularly with economically marginalized families, this study aimed to examine the acceptance and satisfaction of a mindfulness-based healthy eating and stress management program among participating parents and daycare teachers in a pilot trial. METHODS: A mixed-methods study was conducted to evaluate a 14-week mindfulness-based program implemented with 107 English-speaking Head Start children (ages 3-5 years) and their parents. The program included a school-based mindful eating curriculum, a home-based parent component to promote mindful eating and reduce parental stress, and a bridging activity connecting home practice with school learning. Quantitative evaluation data were collected from 84 parents (Mage = 30.12 years) and 12 teachers (Mage = 43.92 years) via Qualtrics. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 parents (Mage = 31.55 years). Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Both quantitative (95.2%) and qualitative data demonstrated overall satisfaction with the entire program. About 83%-92% of teachers and 85% of parents considered the school-based curriculum to be satisfactory and acceptable. About 88%-100% of parents were satisfied with the Facebook private group and parent meetings. Approximately 91% of parents found the child letters helpful in connecting and translating school learning into mindful practices at home. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate high levels of acceptance and satisfaction with the mindfulness-based program among economically marginalized families and daycare teachers. Findings provide several key implications for future interventions to incorporate a mindful eating curriculum into daycare routines, proactively connect home practices with school learning to enhance the interactive influence between children and parents, and form a virtual peer support community through social media platforms and group meetings."

MBCT is a clinical intervention that integrates cognitive therapy with mindfulness practices to prevent depression relapses and improve mental health. Methods: The review focuses on the effects of MBCT on brain structure changes, cognitive processes, and emotional regulation, which are related to improvements in subjective well-being. A total of 87 studies were included in the review to assess the effectiveness of MBCT. Results: Evidence from the studies highlights the effectiveness of MBCT in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. MBCT was also shown to enhance cognitive functions and emotional regulation across diverse populations. These findings point to the potential for MBCT to induce neuroplastic changes in the brain and widen the applicability of the treatment for a variety of disorders, calling for further research into long-term benefits and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Conclusions: The review emphasizes the potential of MBCT to bring about neuroplastic changes, calling for further research into its long-term benefits and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. This study underlines the need to incorporate multidisciplinary measures by integrating psychology and neuroscience to comprehend comprehensively the effects of MBCT."

Method: Using a pretest-posttest parallel controlled design, 102 nurses from the King Abdullah University Hospital were randomly assigned into experimental (n = 51) and control (n = 51) groups. The experimental group received 5 weeks of individual 30-min mindfulness intervention sessions via WhatsApp. The collected data included demographic information as well as baseline and postintervention scores from the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. Findings: Paired t-tests revealed that the experimental group demonstrated significantly lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as higher trait mindfulness scores following the intervention. Independent t-tests indicated that, compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly reduced depression and stress levels and increased trait mindfulness scores at the end of the intervention. Although anxiety scores were lower in the experimental group following the intervention, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Conclusion: This finding aligns with existing literature, which has reported similar outcomes in studies on mindfulness interventions. These studies highlight the potential of mHealth-based mindfulness intervention as a holistic approach to enhancing psychological well-being among nurses who care for patients with COVID-19.

This study examines the effects of COBMINDEX (Cognitive-Behavioral and Mindfulness Intervention with Daily Exercise) on coping strategies and life satisfaction in CD patients, focusing on gender-specific responses. Study objectives were to assess the impact of COBMINDEX on adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies and life satisfaction in CD patients, and to examine gender differences in these outcomes. Materials and Methods: A pre-planned secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, conducted from 2018 to 2021, at two public tertiary hospitals in Israel. A total of 120 CD patients (45 men and 75 women) were randomly assigned to either theCOBMINDEX group or a wait-list control group. Participants were assessed at baseline and post-intervention for coping strategies, mindfulness, psychological symptoms, and life satisfaction using validated scales. Quantile regression explored the gender-specific predictors of life satisfaction. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05085925) and Israel Ministry of Health (MOH_2020- 02- 24_008721. asp). Results: Both genders showed significant improvements in mindfulness, emotion-focused coping, and active coping (p < 0.05). Women exhibited reduced dysfunctional coping and greater emotional support use. For men, emotion-focused coping and mindfulness positively predicted life satisfaction, while for women, reductions in psychological symptoms and dysfunctional coping were significant predictors (p < 0.01). Conclusions: COBMINDEX enhances coping strategies and life satisfaction in CD patients, with notable gender differences. These findings highlight the importance of gender-tailored psychological interventions to improve overall patient well-being."

Method: Sixteen participants were provided with two or three 15-20-min mindfulness sessions. Data were collected before and after each session on blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate, anxiety, and pain. The participants were interviewed before their discharge. Findings: Eight participants (n = 8) received two and eight (n = 8) three sessions. Decreasing blood pressure and lower heart rates were noted after the sessions. Also, decreasing pain scores were found, especially in participants who attended two sessions. Minor decrease in anxiety scores were noticed in participants who attended three sessions. Two major themes emerged from the interviews: healing and restoration of health and becoming in tune with self. These themes were characterized by study participants' reflections on experience of recovery, progression to physical relaxation, pathway to serenity, awareness of emotions, evolution of perceptions and experiences of mindfulness. Conclusions: The physiological changes to mindfulness intervention, composed of two or three sessions, were minor and challenging to measure to demonstrate effects. However, study participants' experiences were very positive and suggest that this intervention could prove to be beneficial for colorectal surgical patients."
