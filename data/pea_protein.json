      "abstract": "There is a growing demand for biodegradable and sustainable materials, particularly those sourced from agricultural or industrial byproducts, for use in wastewater treatment. This study introduces an approach for developing a sponge-like adsorbent derived exclusively from pea protein (PeaAS-PEI) using liquid foam templating for the removal of heavy metals. The pore size, surface area, and mechanical strength of the sponge were modulated by the extent of protein hydrophobic aggregation induced by ammonium sulfate (AS) immersion based on the salting-out effect. Raising AS concentration from 10 to 20% led to an increase in surface area from 30.69 to 127.41 m2/g and compressive stress from 151.02 ± 8.73 kPa to 316.10 ± 13.87 kPa at 90% strain. Polyethylenimine (PEI) grafting introduced additional amine groups for heavy metal adsorption, and the porosity of the sponge increased from 86.9 to 90.3% upon surface modification. As a result, the PEI-modified sponge showed favorable adsorption performance of Cu(II), Zn(II), and Ni(II) ions at pH 5 with maximum sorption capacities of 67.07, 115.61, and 55.86 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm study suggested that the adsorption process was primarily chemisorption and occurred with monolayer interactions. The negative Gibbs free energy change (ΔG < 0) confirmed that the adsorption was thermodynamically spontaneous. Reusability tests for the PeaAS-PEI sponge revealed that its adsorption capacity could be well maintained over five successive adsorption-desorption cycles, with the removal efficiency of Cu(II) over 95%. The pea protein sponge also exhibited excellent biodegradability in soil within 28 days, with weight losses of 86.1% and 67.5% before and after PEI grafting, respectively. Together, these results indicate the great potential of affordable and sustainable PEI-modified pea protein sponges for the remediation of water polluted with copper, zinc, and nickel ions."

      "abstract": "Plant protein-based thermo-reversible gels are essential for meeting the dietary nutritional needs of the elderly and individuals with dysphagia. However, high hydrophobic globulin content and heat-induced denaturation often hinder gel formation. In this study, salt-soluble pea protein isolate (SPPI) was extracted via ammonium sulfate precipitation, and cold plasma (CP) was used to conjugate SPPI with marine oligosaccharides, including chito-oligosaccharides (COS), carrageenan oligosaccharides (CAS), alginate oligosaccharides (AOS) and agaric oligosaccharides (AGS). This approach achieved a maximum grafting degree of 17.89 % and facilitated the thermo-reversible gelation of SPPI. The interaction mechanisms between SPPI and marine oligosaccharides and their effects on the thermo-reversible gels' functional properties were investigated. COS/SPPI-CP exhibited enhanced solubility, conductivity, reduced particle size. Structural analyses revealed increased environmental polarity, enhanced hydrogen bonding, stronger disulfide bonds and reduced hydrophobic interactions, hence indicating a shift towards a more hydrophilic SPPI structure after oligosaccharide conjugation. CP treatment improved gel thermo-reversibility while reducing hardness, adhesiveness, and chewiness, with COS/SPPI-CP showing the lowest values for these properties. Adding 0.3 % NaCl maintained thermo-reversibility, supporting safe swallowing and adequate nutritional intake. These findings contribute to developing pea protein-based supplements for individuals with dysphagia."

      "abstract": "Pea protein isolate (PPI) was modified using high-pressure homogenization (HPH) at three pressure levels (60, 80, and 100 MPa) for three cycles and ultrasound (US) at three power levels (100, 200, and 300 W) for 10 min. Results showed that both techniques significantly increased solubility, oil holding capacity, emulsifying activity and foam capacity. Ultimately, a homogenization pressure of 100 MPa (HPH 100) and an ultrasound power of 300 W (US 300) were identified as the optimal treatments. HPH and US treatments led to a significant reduction in particle size and an increase in the surface charge of the samples. FTIR spectroscopy revealed changes in hydrogen bonding and the secondary structure of PPI after HPH and US treatment. Also, SEM imaging showed that the spherical shape of PPI transformed into heterogeneous sheet structures. Additionally, the comparison of HPH and US techniques revealed that the HPH resulted in a greater reduction in size and a greater increase in solubility and FC compared to the US. On the other hand, the US technique showed greater EAI and thermal stability. Therefore, both HPH and US are effective in altering the PPI structure to enhance its functional properties.",

      "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides derived from food proteins have been studied to regulate hyperglycemia, but their effects on transepithelial transport and inhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, pea protein was ultrasonicated then dually hydrolyzed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa protease (PaproA) and acid protease to exhibit great DPP-IV inhibitory activity (IC50 of 1.34 mg/mL). Novel non-cytotoxic DPP-IV inhibitory peptides were discovered and ranked according to their in vitro activities as follows: YPR > YPHY > YPHYR > WAK > SPR. However, SPR and YPR performed excellent in situ DPP-IV inhibitory behaviors (luminescence of ~1.78 × 105) and permeabilities (Papp of ~1.15 × 10-7 cm/s) during transepithelial transport mediated by PepT1. Studies on DPP-IV inhibitory kinetics and molecular docking have revealed that tyrosine and arginine at the N- and C-termini of the peptides played key roles in competitive inhibition of DPP-IV through π-π stacking, π-anion interaction and hydrogen bonding, respectively. Overall, ultrasonication-assisted sequential hydrolysis by PaproA and acid protease could be a reliable strategy for releasing DPP-IV inhibitory peptides from pea protein for the treatment of diabetes mellitus."

The results showed that MP, represented by casein, and PP form independent networks with rheological behavior dependent on the major protein fraction involved in the mixture. However, a synergistic effect on elasticity and viscosity was observed for the 20:80 ratio, which was further accentuated by temperature and protein concentration increase. Also, the water dynamic was reduced after the thermal treatment, showing that in this ratio the casein, present in the milk proteins suspension is finely distributed within the PP network. These results bring new insights into the physical properties of composite plant/animal protein systems for the development of innovative mixed formulations.",

Modification of proteins by supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) has gained attention in this regard as a safe, chemical-free, and sustainable technique. The present work explores the impact of process parameters of scCO2 modification of pea proteins on its structural and functional properties. This treatment induced the unfolding of protein structure as seen from an increase in intrinsic fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity, altered the secondary structure, and increased the free sulfhydryl groups. The scCO2 treatment positively affected the water and oil absorption capacities and enhanced the emulsifying and foaming capacity and stability. However, the rheological and film-forming properties of scCO2-modified protein were detrimentally affected at 350 bar. scCO2 modified pea proteins (250 bar/45 °C/60 min) revealed a uniform pore size distribution throughout the eggless cake matrix with sensory scores (7.34) comparable to that containing egg (7.59).",

Results indicated that RAM treatment enhanced the water holding capacity (WHC) of PPI gels, with the highest WHC of 94.79 % achieved after RAM treatment for 20 min. A 15-20 min RAM treatment altered the secondary structure of proteins in PPI gels, reducing α-helix content while increasing β-sheet content. This treatment also refined the microstructure of PPI gels, changing the surfaces from rough to smooth and the pores from large to small. RAM treatment for 5-20 min decreased the shear viscosity and gel strength of heat-induced PPI gels, although these properties slightly recovered when the treatment was extended to 30 min. Additionally, RAM treatment improved the in vitro digestibility of PPI gels. In conclusion, RAM treatment significantly influenced the structural, mechanical and digestive properties of PPI gels, and this effect can be regulated by adjusting the treatment duration, making it suitable for various practical applications.",

The mean volume diameter (d4,3) of PPI was reduced from 67.25 ± 3.31 to 45.50 ± 0.62 μm, and secondary structure of protein became more ordered. The addition of SHP enhanced the adsorption of protein at the oil-water interface and reduced the interfacial tension. Interestingly, SHP decreased the short-term (12h) thermal stability index (TSI) from 3.5 to 2.8 in PPI/SHP emulsion treated at 100 °C. These findings validated that heat treatment combined with SHP modification can improve the emulsification of PPI, which positively impacts the development of pea-based products for high temperatures applications.",

      "abstract": "This study was intended to provide a novel process that fills a knowledge gap in relation to the enhancement of pulses utilization. The primary goal was to develop an experimental framework for using a high-pressure supercritical fluid extruder (SCFX) as a continuous bioreactor to produce off-flavor reduced and functionally superior pulse flours and protein concentrates in a single step. The current study focused on using SCFX processing to remove off-flavor from pulse flour and protein concentrates, enhancing the quality, acceptability, and marketability of pulse-based products. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), a well-known green solvent, was employed in combination with an extrusion system to achieve off-flavor reduction at larger scale. Using various methods such as headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography mass-spectroscopy (HS-SPME-GC-MS) and sensory evaluation, this study demonstrated that SCFX significantly reduced the off-flavor in pea flour (PF) and pea protein concentrate (PPC). HS-SPME-GC-MS analyses identified major off-flavor compounds in unextruded PF and PPC, including 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, nonanal, and 2-alkyl methoxypyrazines. Following SCFX treatment, all these compounds except nonanal were removed. Total off-flavor compound concentration dropped from 923 to 126.5 ng/g in PF, and from 571.7 to 65.9 ng/g in pea protein concentrate PPC after SCFX treatment. Sensory evaluation corroborated these HS-SPME-GC-MS findings, showing that over 80% of the participants could accurately distinguish the extruded samples from the unextruded ones, perceiving the treated samples as having the least beany flavor. These findings highlight the efficacy of SCFX processing in enhancing the sensory profile of pulse-based products by removing off-flavor compounds.",

We demonstrate the use of colloidal thermogelation on a real nanoemulsion system to create structured gels that could be of interest for thermo-mechanical processing of next-generation plant-based food applications. We use a commercial pea protein isolate (PPI) without further purification to stabilize a 20 vol% peanut oil-in-water nanoemulsion at pH = 7 by high-pressure homogenization (HPH) and demonstrate the temperature induced gelation behavior of the nanoemulsion as a function of the HPH processing parameters. Bright-field and laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy reveals a diverse microstructure of the aqueous PPI dispersions, with a large amount of insoluble protein particles, cell-wall debris particles, and lipid inclusions. Sedimentation of particulates is prevented by HPH treatment and leads to a loss of the dispersion's thermogelation properties. The non-gelling PPI dispersion stabilizes nanoemulsions and the insoluble components of the PPI dispersions persist throughout the HPH processing. We perform a systematic rheological investigation of the effect of HPH processing on thermogelation and demonstrate that the number of HPH passes n and HPH pressure P control the average nanoemulsion droplet size measured by DLS at a 90° scattering angle. We show that the droplet size defines the final gel strength with a strong inverse dependence of the elastic modulus on droplet size. Furthermore, processing can lead to heterogeneously structured gels that yield over a large strain amplitude range.",

The SEM imaging demonstrated a fine, uniform and dense network structure with many pores in these RAM-PPI gels. However, excessive TGase (0.5 %) reduced the water holding capacity and intestinal digestibility of the RAM-PPI gels, mainly due to the excessive protein cross-linking and re-aggregation.

PPIN showed slight changes, primarily an increase in tryptophan fluorescence. The cleavage of disulfide bonds improved the hardness, elastic component (G'), and network integrity of hybrid gels. When combined with transglutaminase, the MP + PPIpH gel reached its maximum hardness (0.38 N) at a cysteine concentration of 1.7 mM/g protein. SDS-PAGE patterns and gels treated with additional N-ethylmaleimid confirmed the involvement of cysteine-treated PPI in the gel matrix.

      "abstract": "Protein modification can improve the bioavailability of polyphenols, while polyphenols can also improve the functional properties of pea protein. Four representative polyphenols (gallic acid, ferulic acid, catechin and kaempferol) were covalently combined with pea protein by ultrasonic assisted grafting (free radical grafting, laccase method and alkali treatment), and the structure and functional properties of the conjugated compounds were characterized. The interaction was evaluated by surface hydrophobicity, free sulfhydryl content determination and SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence spectra and Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that polyphenol binding reduced the α-helix content of pea protein and changed its structure. In addition, the antioxidant activity of the conjugate was significantly improved compared to natural pea protein (DPPH˙by 7.5 to 20.2 times, ABTS˙+by 2.8 to 4.3 times, FRAP by 1.4 to 4.1 times). At the same time, the introduction of polyphenols also optimized the thermal stability of pea protein, and increased the denaturation temperature of pea protein (113.1 °C) by 0.19-6.63 °C. The emulsifying properties were also enhanced by covalent modification, and the emulsifying properties of the ultrasound-assisted conjugates were better. In summary, the pea protein-polyphenol conjugate provides a new solution for improving the bioavailability of polyphenols and preparing polyphenol delivery systems for complex emulsions.",

After 28 days of supplementation combined with resistance exercise training three times per week. All subjects underwent body composition and muscle strength performance, plasma and fecal samples were collected for microbiota analysis and blood amino acid concentrations. The TWK10 group showed a significant increase in muscle thickness and improvements were observed in 1 repetition maximum bench press, explosive, anaerobic power output compared to before the intervention, and were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). TWK10 supplementation significantly increased the area under the curve and maximum concentration of branched-chain amino acids, essential amino acids, and total amino acids (p < 0.05). Furthermore, TWK10 supplementation effectively increased the richness of gut bacterial families. Our study demonstrated that the TWK10 significant increase in the abundance of specific bacterial families in the gut, resulting in increased pea protein amino acid absorption.

Fe-Fib PP, a stable and effective iron supplement, was fabricated based on the reducing property of pea protein fibrils, derived from pea protein through thermal treatment at pH 2.0. The results demonstrated that the reducing power of iron was remarkably affected by fibril concentration and fibrillization degree. The reducing power of pea protein fibrils gradually enhanced from 0.31 to 0.92 with the increase in incubation time from 0 to 48 h. Compared with iron nanoparticles (Fe-Nano), Fe-Fib PP possessed much higher dispersibility. Additionally, the stability of iron in Fe-Fib PP was significantly higher than that in Fe-Nano under different storage conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) outcomes revealed Fe (II) content in Fe-Fib PP (70.75 ± 0.65%) was remarkably higher than that of Fe-Nano (56.05 ± 0.50%). In addition, the bioaccessibility of Fe (II) dramatically improved from 42.7% to 62.8% using PP fibrils as carriers. The findings suggest that Fe-Fib PP is an effective iron nutrition enhancer."

Conjugating plant proteins with phenolic compounds from plant extracts enhances their techno-functionality and allows their use as stabilizers of emulsion-based systems. This study aimed to (i) combine heat treatment (HT) and conjugation with guarana extract (GE) to improve the emulsifying ability of pea protein isolate (PPI); (ii) encapsulate vitamin D3 (VD) in PPI/GE-stabilized emulsions; (iii) evaluate the potential of these formulations in improving VD retention during storage and in vitro bioaccessibility. The particles showed a size distribution ranging from 0.5 to 10 µm, depending on the processing sequence. Furthermore, HT on PPI dispersions followed by conjugation with GE led to microgels that stabilized emulsions during 30 days of storage at 25 °C. Also, the conjugates significantly improved VD retention, ranging from 74 to 100 %, after 30 days of storage at 25 °C, even in the presence of UV light. VD-loaded emulsions produced by PPI-GE conjugates showed higher bioaccessibility values (>65 %) compared to emulsions produced by PPI alone (∼58 %) and VD-incorporated sunflower oil (37 %). Given the above, the technological modification of PPI through conjugation with GE phenolic compounds and HT efficiently produced O/W emulsions loaded with VD, improving its bioaccessibility and tailoring a system with potential application in plant-based beverage and dessert formulations.",

This study reports on the effects of cold argon plasma (CP) treatment of a 15 % (w/w) PPI solution on the functionality, structure, and oxidative characteristics of PPI, as well as its application in 3D-printed plant-based meat. Results indicate that hydroxyl radicals and high-energy excited-state argon atoms are the primary active substances. A decrease in free sulfhydryl content and an increase in carbonyl content were observed in treated PPI, indicating oxidative modification. Compared to the control group, the gel strength of PPI was increased by 62.5 % and the storage modulus was significantly improved after 6 min treatment, forming a more ordered and highly cross-linked 3D gel network. Additionally, CP significantly improved the water-holding capacity, oil-holding capacity, emulsifying activity, and emulsion stability of PPI. The α-helix and random coil content in PPI decreased, while the β-sheet content increased, resulting in a more ordered secondary structure after CP treatment. Compared to untreated PPI, the consistency coefficient (K) increased from 36.00 to 47.68 Pa·sn. The treated PPI exhibited higher apparent viscosity and storage modulus and demonstrated better 3D printing performance and self-supporting ability. This study demonstrates that CP can significantly enhance the functional properties of PPI, providing great potential and prospects for improving the printability of 3D printing materials and developing plant protein foods with low-allergenicity.",

The findings demonstrated that by manipulating the ultrasonic power and treatment duration, great enhancement of the solubility, adhesiveness and formation strength of PPIc gel can be realized. The reduction in particle size was positively correlated with higher power and longer treatment durations. Interestingly, no direct correlation between average particle size, solubility, turbidity, and ζ-potential was observed. Additionally, the ultrasound-modified PPIc in this study exhibited comparable characteristics to laboratory-prepared pea protein isolates, in terms of solubility, water-holding capacity, and gel strength.

Measurements included color parameters, extract entrapment efficiency, physical stability, textural properties, microrheology, FT-IR, thermal degradation (TGA), SEM images, total polyphenols content, antioxidant activity, and reducing power. The control hydrogel was obtained using only thermal induction. Both treatments impacted physical stability by affecting biopolymer aggregate structures. Thermal and US combined induction resulted in hydrogels with noticeable color changes and reduced entrapment efficiency. Conversely, thermal and HHP-combined induction, especially with extended secondary treatment (10 min), enhanced hydrogel strength, uniformity, and extract entrapment efficiency (EE = 33% for P10). FT-IR and TGA indicated no chemical structural alterations post-treatment. Sequential thermal and HHP induction preserved polyphenol content, antioxidant activity (ABTS = 5.8 mg TE/g d.m.; DPPH = 11.1 mg TE/g d.m.), and reducing power (RP = 1.08 mg TE/g d.m.) due to the dense hydrogel structure effectively enclosing the elderberry extract.

The ternary complexes were comprehensively evaluated for physicochemical attributes, stability, emulsifying capacities, antioxidant properties, and antimicrobial efficacy. PP-HA binary complexes were first prepared at pH 7, and then CA was bound to the binary complexes, as verified by fluorescence quenching. Molecular docking elucidated that PP interacted with HA and CA through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The particle size of ternary complexes initially decreased, then increased with CA concentration, peaking at 0.025%. Ternary complexes demonstrated good stability against UV light and thermal treatment. Emulsifying activity of complexes initially decreased and then increased, with a turning point of 0.025%, while emulsion stability continued to increase. Complexes exhibited potent scavenging ability against free radicals and iron ions, intensifying with higher CA concentrations. Ternary complexes effectively inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, with inhibition up to 0.025%, then decreasing with CA concentration. Our study indicated that the prepared ternary complexes at pH 7 were stable and possessed good functionality, including emulsifying properties, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial properties under certain concentrations of CA. These findings may provide valuable insights for the targeted design and application of protein-polysaccharide-polyphenol complexes in beverages and dairy products."

The effects of ultrasound treatment on pea protein isolate (PPI) characteristics such as solubility, particle size, emulsification, surface hydrophobicity, and surface free sulfhydryl group were examined, determining optimal HIU processing conditions was 400 W for 10 min. The developed W1/O/W2 double emulsion system based on HIU-PPI demonstrated effective encapsulation and protection of L. plantarum, especially at the HIU-PPI concentration of 4 %, achieving an encapsulation efficiency of 52.65 %. Incorporating both HIU-PPI and pectin as emulsifiers increased the particle size and significantly enhanced the emulsion's viscosity. The highest bacterial encapsulation efficiency of the emulsion, 59.94 %, was attained at a HIU to pectin concentration ratio of 3:1. These emulsions effectively encapsulate and protect L. plantarum, with the concentration of HIU-PPI being a critical factor in enhancing probiotic survival under simulated gastrointestinal digestion. However, the concurrent utilization of pectin and HIU-PPI as emulsifiers did not provide a notable advantage compared to the exclusive use of HIU-PPI in enhancing probiotic viability during in vitro simulated digestion. This research offers valuable perspectives for the food industry on harnessing environmentally friendly, plant-based proteins as emulsifiers in probiotic delivery systems. It underscores the potential of HIU-modified pea protein and pectin in developing functional food products that promote the health benefits of probiotics.",

However, the syneresis effects of their combination on the gelling capacity of commercial plant protein remains unclear. This was investigated by measuring the rheological property, microstructure and protein-protein interactions of gels formed from Alcalase hydrolyzed or intact pea proteins in the presence of 0.1 % CMC and 0-25 mM CaCl2. Sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed the molecular weight of pea protein in the mixture were < 15 kDa after hydrolysis. The hydrolysates showed higher intrinsic fluorescence intensity and lower surface hydrophobicity than the intact proteins. Rheology showed that the storage modulus (G') of hydrolyzed pea protein (PPH)-based gels sightly decreased compared to those of native proteins. 5-15 mM CaCl2 increased the G' for both PP and PPH-based gels and decreased the strain in the creep-recovery test. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the presence of smaller protein aggregates in the PPH-based gels compared to PP gels and the gel network became denser, and more compact and heterogenous in the presence of 15 and 25 mM CaCl2. The gel dissociation assay revealed that hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds were the dominant forces to maintain the gel structure. In vitro digestion showed that the soluble protein content in PPH-based gels was 10 ∼ 30 % higher compared to those of the PP counterpart. CaCl2 addition reduced protein digestibility with a concentration dependent behavior. The results obtained show contrasting effects of limited proteolysis and CaCl2 on the gelling capacity and digestibility of commercial pea proteins. These findings offer practical guidelines for developing pea protein-based food products with a balanced texture and protein nutrition through formulation and enzymatic pre-treatment.",

      "abstract": "The extensive utilization in food industry of pea protein is often impeded by its low water solubility, resulting in poor functional properties. Various methods, including pH-shifting (PS), ultrasonication (US), high-pressure micro-fluidization (MF), pH-shifting combined with ultrasonication (PS-US), and pH-shifting with micro-fluidization (PS-MF), were utilized to modify pea protein isolate (PPI) in order to enhance its functionality in emulsion formulation. The physicochemical properties and structural changes of the protein were investigated by assessing solubility, particle size, surface charge, protein profile, surface hydrophobicity, free sulfhydryl groups, and secondary structure content. The extent of modification induced by each treatment method on PPI-stabilized emulsions was compared based on parameters such as adsorbed interfacial protein concentration, particle size, zeta potential, and microstructure of the prepared emulsions. All modification increased the solubility of pea protein in the sequence of PS (4-fold) < MF (7-fold) < US (11-fold) < PS-US (13-fold) < PS-MF (14-fold). For single treatments, proteins dissolved more readily under US, resulting in the most uniform emulsions with small particle. The combined processes of PS-US and PS-MF further improved solubility, decreased emulsions particle size, promoted uniformity of emulsions. PS-US-stabilized emulsions displayed more smaller droplet size, narrower size distribution, and slightly higher stability than those prepared by PS-MF. The relatively higher emulsifying capacity of PPI treated by PS-US than those by PS-MF may be attributed to its higher surface hydrophobicity.",

Besides, protein digestion was analyzed following the static INFOGEST in vitro digestion protocol. Generally, increasing pressure of the homogenization treatment was linked with decreasing particle sizes and enhanced protein digestion. More specifically, the dispersion that did not undergo HPH (0 MPa) as well as the dispersion treated at 60 °C, pH 7, had highly similar microstructures, consisting of large irregular particles (10 - 500 µm) with shell-like structures, and exhibited low solubility (around 15 % and 28 %, respectively), which resulted in limited proteolysis (35 % and 42 %, respectively). In contrast, the dispersion subjected to HPH at 100 MPa and the dispersion treated at 60 °C, pH 12 also had similar microstructures with small and homogeneous particles (<1 µm), and exhibited relatively good solubility (54 % and 31 %, respectively), which led to enhanced protein digestion levels (87 % and 74 %, respectively). This study highlights the potential of food processing on macronutrient (micro)structure and further gastrointestinal stability and functionality.",

How to enhance the processing performance of plant proteins by simple and green modification means has become a hot research topic nowadays. Based on the above problems, we studied the effect of gel induction on its properties. In this study, a pea protein-zein complex was prepared by the pH cycle method, and the effects of different induced gel methods on the gel properties of the complex protein were studied. The conclusions are as follows: All three gel induction methods can make the complex protein form a gel system, among which the gel strength of heat treatment and the TG enzyme-inducted group is the highest (372.84 g). Through the observation of the gel microstructure, the gel double network structure disappears and the structure becomes denser, which leads to a stronger water-binding state of the gel sample in the collaborative treatment group. In the simulated digestion experiment, heat treatment and enzyme-induced samples showed the best slow-release effect. This study provides a new method for the preparation of multi-vegetable protein gels and lays a theoretical foundation for their application in food processing."

In this study, in order to improve the rheological properties and stability of pea protein to prepare HIPE, pea protein/carboxymethyl cellulose (pH-PP/CMC) was prepared and subjected to pH cycle treatment to produce HIPEs. The results showed that pH cycle treatment and CMC significantly reduced the droplet size of HIPEs (from 143.33 to 12.10 μm). At higher CMC concentrations, the interfacial tension of the PP solution decreased from 12.84 to 11.71 mN/m without pH cycle treatment and to 10.79 mN/m with pH cycle treatment. The HIPEs with higher CMC concentrations subjected to pH cycle treatment showed shear thinning behavior and higher viscoelasticity and recovered their solid-like properties after being subjected to 50 % strain, indicating that they could be used for 3D printing. The 3D printing results showed that the pH-PP/CMC HIPE with 0.3 % CMC had the finest structure.

However, the interaction between pea protein isolate (PPI) and soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS) has not been thoroughly characterized yet. RESULTS: In the present study, the phase behavior of PPI and SSPS mixtures was analyzed as a function of PPI:SSPS mixing ratio (1:1 to 1:0.10) and pH (7.0 to 2.0), showing that these biopolymers could be electrostatically assembled at 1:1 to 1:0.25 mixing ratios and 4.0 to 3.0 pH values. Then, the characteristics of the PPI-SSPS complexes were studied before and after heating (90 °C and 30 min) by ζ-potential, surface hydrophobicity, protein solubility, particle size distribution and physical stability for 56 days. By lowering the pH and PPI:SSPS mixing ratio, the complexes showed increased solubility, changed 𝜁-potential and higher physical stability. By heating, the complexes presented increased hydrophobicity and physical stability. CONCLUSION: Overall, PPI-SSPS complexes increased the protein solubility, reduced the particle size, and changed both the ζ-potential and the surface hydrophobicity with respect to PPI control, allowing stabilization of the colloidal system and broadening the possible applications of these high-quality proteins in acidic food systems. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

The minimum gelation concentration achieved for SMM-treated pea protein was 4 %, significantly lower than that of heat-pretreated pea protein (9 %). SMM decreased protein aggregate size from 104 μm to 180 nm. Microscopy analysis revealed that the small aggregates facilitated the formation of uniform gel networks with tight connections. Linear rheology indicated that small protein aggregates resulted in slower gelation rates with a higher G' for the formed gels. The SMM-pretreated protein gel showed strain hardening, shear thinning behaviors, and satisfactory stability to withstand large-amplitude oscillatory shear. Overall, SMM emerges as a promising technology for producing protein gel products with strong mechanical attributes and customizable rheological properties.",

This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of a topical treatment containing xyloglucan, pea proteins and Opuntia ficus-indica extracts (XPO) compared to calcipotriol 50mcg/betamethasone 0.5mg ointment (CB). METHODS: Forty-two patients diagnosed with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis were assigned 1:1 to XPO treatment or CB for 28 days. Disease status was assessed at baseline (V1), monitored every two weeks (V2, V3), and at follow-up (V4). Disease severity was assessed by PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index), PGA (Physician's Global Assessment), and VAS (Visual Analog Scale for itching). Photos were taken before and after XPO treatment. Treatment efficacy was determined by comparing psoriasis severity at baseline to V3. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events. RESULTS: Both groups showed a statistically significant difference in PASI score from V1 to V2 (p=0.001, XPO; p=0.008, CB) and to V3 (p=0.001, XPO; p=0.004, CB). XPO achieved a PASI 50 score of 24 percent at V2 and 52 percent at V3 compared to CB (0% at V2 and 19% at V3). At V3, PGA was significantly reduced in both groups (p=0.003, XPO; p=0.001 CB). Both treatments significantly reduced itching at V2 (p=0.001, XPO; p=0.003, CB) and V3 (p=0.001, XPO; p=0.0005, CB). CONCLUSION: XPO showed similar efficacy to CB, significantly reducing disease severity, erythema, itching, induration, and scaling with an excellent tolerability profile."

Rheological analyses indicated that storage modulus (G') was greater than loss modulus (G″) for CP-treated protein gels. Furthermore, in vitro protein digestibility of SPI exhibited a remarkable improvement (4.78 %) at 30 kV for 6 min compared to PPI (3.23 %). Spectroscopic analyses, including circular dichroism and Fourier Transform-Raman, indicated partial breakdown and loss of α-helix structure in both samples, leading to the aggregation of proteins.

This study used pea protein isolate (PPI) as the main raw material and investigated the effects of high-pressure homogenization (HPH), ultrasonic treatment (US), and the combination of the two in different orders on the structure and function of PPI. The results showed that HPH or US promoted the transformation of PPI insoluble suspension into a uniform protein dispersion, significantly reducing particle size, unfolding the spatial structure, exposing more amino acid residues. These structural changes resulted in a substantial increase in the solubility, foaming capacity and emulsifying activity of PPI. Moreover, the combined treatments further impacted the properties of PPI, largely depending on the order of the processing steps; the combination of HPH-US exhibited the best functional characteristics."

Our previous studies showed that pea protein hydrolysate (PPH) could suppress hepatic glucose production in hepatic cells via inhibiting the gluconeogenic signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that PPH could play the hypoglycemic role in vivo. METHODS: In the present study, the mice model with type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) was developed by high-fat diet and low dose of streptozotocin injections. PPH was administered orally with a dosage of 1000 mg/kg body weight for 9 weeks, followed by the downstream biomedical analyses. RESULTS: The results showed that the 9-week treatment of PPH could reduce fasting blood glucose by 29.6% and improve glucose tolerance in the T2DM mice. The associated mechanisms included suppression of the gluconeogenic pathway, activation of the insulin signaling and modulation of the renin angiotensin system in the liver of the diabetic mice. In addition, the levels of pro-inflammatory markers in both liver and serum were reduced by the PPH treatment. CONCLUSION: The hypoglycemic effect of PPH in T2DM mice was demonstrated in the present study. Findings from this study could provide rationale to incorporate PPH into functional foods or nutraceuticals for glycemic control."

The impact of β-ionizing was measured on the volatile compounds of five pea protein isolates. These isolates were subjected to ionizing radiation of 10 MeV electron beam and the volatile compounds were compared by SPME-GC-MS before and after the treatment. β-Ionization led to a major increase in the total amount of volatiles and to appearance of new compounds. We observed a strong increase in aldehydes, that were reported to be involved in pea off-flavor, and the appearance of dimethyl-disulfide, linked to sulfurous off-notes. Many of the compounds impacted by the treatment were linked to protein and lipid oxidations. Mechanisms explaining the impact of β-ionizing on lipids and protein oxidations were proposed."

It is essential to understand these distinctions to develop novel food emulsion using plant proteins. It is hypothesized that differing interfacial properties can be attributed to their structures, aggregation, and colloidal states. EXPERIMENTS: The adsorption behavior of a commercial protein isolate, homogenized or non-homogenized, was compared to a mildly extracted isolate to evaluate the effect of aggregation state and structural differences. After characterization of the particle size and protein composition, the interfacial properties were compared. FINDINGS: Atomic force microscopy provided evidence of interfaces packed with protein oligomers regardless of the treatment. Differences in adsorption kinetics and interfacial shear rheology depending on oil polarity suggested different interfacial structures. A polydisperse mixture of protein oligomers resulted in increased rearrangements and protein-protein interactions at the interface. Homogenization of commercial proteins resulted in a lower interfacial tension and less elastic interfaces compared to those of native proteins due to the presence of larger aggregates. This study highlights how the interfacial properties can be related to the protein aggregation state resulting from differences in processing history.",

Additionally, the study examined the influence of storage time on the functional properties of these gels. Fermentation-induced pea protein gels were produced in the presence or absence of TG and stored for 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. Texture analysis, rheological measurements, moisture content and microstructure evaluation with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and 3D image analysis were conducted to explore the effects of TG on the structural and rheological properties of the fermented samples. The porosity of the protein networks in the pea gels decreased in the presence of TG, the storage modulus increased and the textural characteristics were significantly improved, resulting in harder and more springy gels. The gel porosity increased in gels with and without TG after storage but the effect of storage on textural and rheological properties was limited, indicating limited structural rearrangement once the fermentation-induced pea protein emulsion gels are formed. Greater coalescence was observed for oil droplets within the gel matrix after 16 weeks of storage in the absence of TG, consistent with these protein structures being weaker than the more structurally stable TG-treated gels. This study shows that TG treatment is a powerful tool to enhance the textural and rheological properties of fermentation-induced pea protein emulsion gels.",

Currently, there are no treatments targeting the etiology of FABD. METHODS: This double-blind, multicenter, randomized study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a product containing xyloglucan and pea proteins (XG + PP) compared with simethicone, both administered orally (three times daily) for 20 consecutive days. Eighty-eight patients with FABD were randomly assigned to the two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Primary outcome was safety; secondary outcomes were (i) efficacy in alleviating the symptoms of FABD and (ii) efficacy in reducing SIBO, as assessed by hydrogen breath test (HBT). RESULTS: No Adverse Events or Serious Unexpected Adverse Reactions were reported during the study. XG + PP showed a faster onset of action and a significant reduction in bloating and abdominal pain compared with simethicone. At Day 20, XG + PP drastically reduced abdominal girth when compared with simethicone, with an average reduction of 4.7 cm versus 1.8 cm. At Day 20, the XG + PP arm showed a significant reduction in HBT compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the evidence that FABD patients may benefit from a XG + PP-based treatment that acts on etiology and not just the symptoms.",

Pickering emulsion was prepared using pea protein isolate (PPI)/octenyl succinic anhydrate corn starch (OSA-CS) composite nanoparticles (PPI/OSA-CS) as stabilizers. PPI/OSA-CS was prepared with pH adjustment and ultrasonic treatment, and the particle size was 100.05 ± 0.46 nm. The formation of PPI/OSA-CS through hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bond was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy and dissociation analysis. The results indicated that the emulsion stabilized with composite nanoparticles at 1.5% particle concentration had smaller particle size and better stability than at other concentrations. This could be attributed to the presence of sufficient composite nanoparticles wrapped around the surface of oil droplets. At high temperature (100 °C) and high ionic strength (500 mM), the emulsion remained stable. These results provide a potential method for preparing a novel and stable Pickering emulsion, which could have important applications in various fields.",

In addition to its valuable amino acid composition, PP has a low environmental impact, making it a sustainable, nutritious, and viable alternative for enhanced sports performance, such as in soccer. PP Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of PP and WP supplementation on biochemical and metabolic parameters in soccer players. METHODS: Twelve male under-20 soccer players were included in this double-blind, randomized crossover intervention study. For 10 consecutive days, each participant received either 0.5 g/kg of the PP or WP supplementation after training, starting 7 days before the test game, and continuing until 2 days after. After a 4-day washout period, the athletes switched groups and the intervention was restarted. Blood samples were collected before and after the game, as well as 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h intervals thereafter. Creatine kinase (CK), aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate (LA), urea, creatinine, and uric acid were analyzed using commercial kits. Exploratory metabolic profiling of the serum samples was performed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: A comparison of biochemical markers showed that the PP group had lower CK in the post-game moment, 24 h, and 48 h. Lower LA in the post-game moment, and lower ALT in the post-game moment and at 24 h. Of the 48 metabolites analyzed, 22 showed significant differences between the time points, such as amino acids, ketone bodies, and glucose metabolism. Glutamate and lactate levels significantly increased between the pre- and post-game moments in the WP group. After the game, the WP group exhibited reduced levels of metabolites such as arginine and taurine, whereas no such change was observed in the PP group. There was no difference in metabolites 72 h after the game. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the slight advantage of the PP group in specific biochemical markers, these differences are not sufficient to justify the choice of a particular type of protein. However, the results highlight the viability of plant protein as a potential alternative to animal protein without compromising athletic performance or recovery."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pea protein, as a by-product of peas (Pisum sativum L.), is rich in a variety of essential amino acids that can meet the body's protein needs and is a valuable source of protein. Since the function of pea protein is closely related to its structure, pea protein has been subjected to different modifications in recent years to improve its application in food and to develop new products. RESULTS: The effects of sonication frequency (primary and secondary time) on pea protein isolate's (PPI's) structural and functional properties were investigated. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that different sonication frequencies at the same power (600 W) treatment had no effect on PPI's molecular weight. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that treatment at different sonication frequencies caused secondary structural changes in PPI. The particle size distribution, foaming, stability, surface hydrophobicity, emulsification, and oxidation resistance of PPI were improved after primary and secondary sonication, but secondary sonication was not more effective than primary sonication for an extended period of time. CONCLUSION: Overall, ultrasound is able to improve the structural and functional properties of pea proteins within a suitable range. It provides a theoretical basis for elucidating the modification of the structure and function of plant proteins by ultrasound and lays the foundation for the development of plant proteins in food applications as well as development. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Topical corticosteroids are the main treatment for mild to moderate AD, although they can induce side effects. The efficacy and tolerability of xyloglucan and pea protein (XG-PP) was compared with hydrocortisone in pediatric patients with AD as a steroid-sparing solution. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, comparative study enrolled 42 patients (age 0.5-12 years) with mild-to-moderate AD, assigned 1:1 to XG-PP or hydrocortisone ointment. Treatments were applied twice daily for 14 consecutive days and assessed at baseline, day 8, and day 15. Efficacy endpoints were AD Severity Index (ADSI) score, Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index, and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM). Tolerability was assessed by the occurrence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Both treatments significantly improved ADSI mean score from baseline to day 15; in the XG-PP arm, ADSI score decreased from 10.55 to 4.15 (p = 0.00001), and in the hydrocortisone arm, from 10.65 to 4.30 (p = 0.0001). In the XG-PP arm, the mean SCORAD score decreased from 65.86 to 30.26 (p = 0.00001) and in the hydrocortisone arm from 68.84 to 31.19 (p = 0.0001) at day 15. An overall decrease from moderate to mild AD for both arms (p = 0.0001) was observed with POEM. For all the three indexes evaluated, no statistical significant differences between the study arms evolution from baseline to day 8 or to day 15 were found. No AEs were reported. CONCLUSION: XG-PP provided a comparable efficacy to hydrocortisone ointment in managing AD, thus representing a safe and effective steroid-sparing alternative in pediatric patients with AD.

Dietary interventions incorporating specific nutrients, such as pea proteins or inulin, have shown promise in attenuating age-related muscle loss. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pea proteins given with inulin on skeletal muscle in old rats. Old male rats (20 months old) were randomly assigned to one of two diet groups for 16 weeks: a 'PEA' group receiving a pea-protein-based diet, or a 'PEA + INU' group receiving the same pea protein-based diet supplemented with inulin. Both groups showed significant postprandial stimulation of muscle p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation rate after consumption of pea proteins. However, the PEA + INU rats showed significant preservation of muscle mass with time together with decreased MuRF1 transcript levels. In addition, inulin specifically increased PGC1-α expression and key mitochondrial enzyme activities in the plantaris muscle of the old rats. These findings suggest that dietary supplementation with pea proteins in combination with inulin has the potential to attenuate age-related muscle loss. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and determine the optimal dosage and duration of intervention for potential translation to human studies.",

However, the digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) for heat-treated rapeseed protein isolate is unknown. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that heating rapeseed protein isolate improves protein quality resulting in DIAAS that is greater than for pea and rice protein concentrates, and comparable to that of soy and whey protein isolates. RESULTS: Standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA), except leucine and methionine, was not different between heat-treated rapeseed protein isolate and soy protein isolate, but SID of most AA was greater (P < 0.001) for heat-treated rapeseed protein isolate than for brown rice protein concentrate, pea protein concentrate, rapeseed protein isolate and soy protein isolate, but not whey protein isolate. Non-heated rapeseed protein isolate had a reduced (P < 0.001) DIAAS for 6-month-old to 3-year-old children compared with soy protein isolate, but this was greater (P < 0.001) than for pea and brown rice protein concentrates. The DIAAS for heat-treated rapeseed protein isolate was greater (P < 0.001) than for non-heated rapeseed protein isolate for all age groups. Heat-treated rapeseed protein isolate and whey protein isolate had a DIAAS > 100 for individuals older than 3 years. CONCLUSION: Rapeseed protein isolate had a DIAAS comparable to soy protein isolate, but heat-treated rapeseed protein isolate and whey protein isolate had DIAAS ≥ 100, qualifying these proteins as 'excellent'.

This study investigated the conformational change and molecular mechanism of pea protein isolate (PPI) under pulsed electric field (PEF)-assisted (-)-Epigallocatechin-Gallate (EGCG) modification. The flexibility of PPI was significantly enhanced after PEF treatment (10 kV/cm) with decrease (23.25 %) in α-helix and increase (117.25 %) in random coil. The binding constant and sites of PEF-treated PPI with EGCG were increased by 2.35 times and 10.00 % (308 K), respectively. Molecular docking verified that PEF-treated PPI had more binding sites with EGCG (from 4 to 10). The number of amino acid residues involved in hydrophobic interactions in PEF-treated PPI-EGCG increased from 5 to 13. PEF-treated PPI-EGCG showed a significantly increased antioxidant activity compared to non-PEF-treated group. This work revealed the molecular level of PEF-assisted EGCG modification of PPI, which will be significant for the application of PPI in food industry.",

      "abstract": "Pea protein are emerging as the most potential alternative for meat products, but its application was hindered by their weaker gelling properties. Here, the feasibility of combining the Hofmeister anion (CO32-, Citrate3-, and SO42-) effect with microbial transglutaminase (MTG) cross-linking strategy to improve the techno-functional properties of pea protein was studied. Hofmeister anions or/and MTG treatment of pea protein caused a clear shift in far-UV CD spectra towards β-turn and random coil structures. Furthermore, Hofmeister anion and MTG-induced crosslinking caused a reduction of surface hydrophobicity in contrast with anions-treated. Compared to CO32- and SO42-, Citrate3- treatment can better improve the efficiency of MTG-crosslinking, as demonstrated by a reduction in free amino group contents and an increase in mean diameter size. Using MTG in combination with Hofmeister anions showed significantly improved foam property and gel hardness as well as decrease gelation temperature of pea protein, specifically Citrate3- treatment. Thus, this research provides a novel and effective method to improve the effect of MTG-cross-linked pea protein, which will play an essential role in future food production.",

To achieve this, α-tocopherol was incorporated to impart antioxidant activity to the film. We investigated the effects on film properties resulting from the addition of α-tocopherol in a nanoemulsion form and pH-shifting treatment of PPI. The results revealed that direct addition of α-tocopherol into un-treated PPI film disrupted film structure and formed a discontinuous film with rough surface, and thereby significantly decreasing the tensile strength and elongation at break. However, pH-shifting treatment in combination with the α-tocopherol nanoemulsion, formed a smooth and compact film, which greatly improved the mechanical properties. It also significantly changed the color and opacity of PPI film, but had little effects on film solubility, moisture content, and water vapor permeability. After the addition of α-tocopherol, the DPPH scavenging ability of PPI film was greatly improved and the release of α-tocopherol was mainly within the first 6 h. Additionally, pH-shifting and nanoemulsion did not affect the film's antioxidant activity nor the release rate. In conclusion, pH-shifting combined with nanoemulsion is an effective method to incorporate hydrophobic compounds such as α-tocopherol into protein-based edible films without negative impacts on film mechanical properties."

The objective of this research was to develop a novel rice-pea protein gel using alkali-heat treatment. This gel had a higher solubility, stronger gel strength, better water retention capacity, and denser bilayer network. This is due to the alkali-heat induced modifications for the secondary structures of proteins (i.e., a decrease in the α-helix, and an increase in the β-sheets) and the interactions between protein molecules. The network structure of gel was more compact by adding 2% and 4% alkali-heat rice protein (AH-RP). This resulted in a stable double-layer network structure of gel. Adding 4% AH-RP significantly improved the hardness and elasticity of gel. This gel will have a good potential use for being the ingredient to produce the functional foods and meat analogs.",

Corticosteroids are considered to be standard treatments, but often come with side effects and lose efficacy with long-term use. Alternative treatments targeting the epidermal barrier defect are needed to manage the disease. Film-forming substances such as xyloglucan, pea protein and Opuntia ficus-indica extract (XPO) have generated interest for their ability to restore skin barrier integrity and may pose an alternative approach to disease management. Thus, the aim of this two-part study was to evaluate the barrier-protective properties of a topical cream containing XPO on the membrane permeability of keratinocytes exposed to inflammatory conditions and compare its efficacy to dexamethasone (DXM) in an in vivo model of psoriasis-like dermatitis. XPO treatment significantly reduced S. aureus adhesion, subsequent skin invasion and restored epithelial barrier function in keratinocytes. Furthermore, the treatment restored the integrity of keratinocytes, reducing tissue damage. In mice with psoriasis-like dermatitis, XPO significantly reduced erythema, inflammatory markers and epidermal thickening with a superior efficacy to dexamethasone. Given the promising results, XPO may represent a novel steroid-sparing therapeutic for epidermal-related diseases such as psoriasis, thanks to its ability to preserve skin barrier function and integrity.",

      "abstract": "Pea protein has been extensively studied because of its high nutritional value, low allergenicity, environmental sustainability, and low cost. However, the use of pea protein in some food products is hindered due to the low functionality of pea protein, especially as an emulsifier. High-internal-phase emulsions (HIPEs) are attracting attention because of their potential application in the replacement of hydrogenated plastic fats in foods. In this study, the use of glycated pea protein isolate (PPI) as an emulsifier to prepare HIPEs is proposed. The functionalization of a commercial PPI in two ratios of maltodextrin (MD) (1:1 and 1:2) via glycosylation (15 and 30 min), to act as an emulsifier in HIPEs, is investigated. HIPE properties, such as oil loss and texture, were evaluated and related to microstructural properties. Glycated-PPI-stabilized HIPEs showed high consistency, firmness, viscosity, and cohesiveness values; a tight and homogeneous structure; and physical stability throughout storage. The results showed that emulsions were more stable when using a 1:2 ratio and 30 min of heat treatment. However, the reaction time was more determinant for improving the textural properties when a 1:1 ratio was used for glycosylation than when a 1:2 ratio was used. Glycosylation with MD via the Maillard reaction is a suitable method to enhance the emulsifying and stabilizing properties of PPI."

The imbalance of the vaginal microbiota plays a key role in the development of BV. It has been demonstrated that Gardnerella vaginalis (GV), a facultative anaerobic bacillus, is involved in BV. Due to the rising number of antimicrobial-resistant species, recurrence of BV is becoming more frequent in women; thus, alternative treatments to antibiotics are needed. Natural substances have recently shown a great efficacy for the treatment of vaginal dysbiosis. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the beneficial effect of a product containing pea protein (PP), grape seed extract (GS) and lactic acid (LA) in an in vivo model of Gardnerella vaginalis-induced vaginosis by intravaginal administration of GV suspension (1 × 106 CFU/20 µL saline). Our results demonstrated that the product containing PP, GS and LA significantly reduced GV proliferation. More specifically, it significantly preserved tissue architecture and reduced neutrophil infiltration, inflammatory markers and sialidase activity when used both as a pre- or a post-treatment. Moreover, the product displayed strong bioadhesive properties. Therefore, our data suggested that the product containing PP, GS and LA could be used as alternative preventive or curative treatment for the management of BV.",

Raw milk, skim milk, and cream, as well as model dispersions with combinations of dairy products and pea protein (i.e., raw milk with pea protein, skim milk with pea protein, and cream with pea protein) were employed as test samples. UST experiments were conducted at a pressure of 400 MPa and 70 °C shear valve exit temperature. The UST treatment increased the viscosity of the dispersions and the increases depended on the fat level. Dairy-pea protein dispersions from raw milk and skim milk were shear thinning and mathematically described by the power-law model defined by the consistency coefficient, K (Pa·sn) and the flow behavior index, n. UST treated cream + pea protein dispersions produced structures with gel-like characteristics. Microstructure and particle size analysis determined by laser scanning microscope revealed a reduction in particle size after UST treatment in raw milk + pea protein and skim milk + pea protein dispersions up to 7.55 and 8.30 μm, respectively. In contrast, the particle mean diameter of cream + pea protein dispersions increased up to 77.20 μm after the UST treatment. Thus, the effect of UST on the particle size and rheological behavior of the dispersions depended on the fat level. UST-treated dispersions were stable with no visible phase separation or sedimentation upon centrifugation at 4000×g for 30 min (4 °C). Heat treatment and freeze-thaw treatment of UST-treated samples showed stable blends immediately after the treatments, but subsequent centrifugation showed solid separation. Results from the study suggest that UST is a potential technology to produce stable dairy + pea protein liquids foods with different rheological characteristics for diverse applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hybrid batters constitute the base for the processing of cooked and dry meat analogues. The use of texturized plant proteins in their formulation is a key strategy to reduce the consumption of animal proteins, although off-flavors present in these plant proteins often cause sensory rejection. The aim was to study the effect of a deodorization process of pea protein, for their use in hybrid meat batters at different percentages of substitution. RESULTS: Hybrid patties with higher percentages of pea protein showed higher values of yellowness, pH, and water activity, whereas hardness was reduced. Soaking treatment with ethanol for deodorization of the texturized pea protein increased humidity and pH in all patties but reduced the textural properties (hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness). The addition of oat flour improved the patty texture at higher percentages of pea protein, but in soaked deodorized patty formulations it affected volatile retention. Volatile compounds related to off-flavors (aldehydes, alcohols, acid compounds, ketones, and pyrazines) appeared significantly increased as the pea percentage increased, although these were efficiently removed by the soaking deodorizing process applied. CONCLUSION: Soaking of the texturized pea protein with ethanol is an effective strategy to reduce off-flavors in hybrid meat patties. However, it produces changes in the textural characteristics by the solubilization of the proteins of the texturized pea, reducing the availability to form a network and affecting volatile retention. The formulation of hybrid batter should be controlled in all sensory aspects for the processing of cooked and dry cured meat product analogues. © 2023 The Authors.

Up to 8% of women in various populations experience more than three or four episodes within one year, which is regarded as recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). Current therapies involve antifungal drugs that provide static effects but do not prevent recurrences due to increased antimicrobial resistance; thus, alternative therapies to antifungals are needed to prevent RVVC. METHODS: A murine model of Candida albicans-induced RVVC was performed to evaluate the efficacy of a topical product containing pea protein (PP), grape seed extract (GS), and lactic acid (LA) to treat recurrent infections. Mice were inoculated with three separate vulvovaginal infections of 5 × 104 cells/mL C. albicans, and histological evaluation, a myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay. and an ELISA kit for Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on vaginal tissues were performed. RESULTS: The data obtained highlighted that the combination of PP, GS, and LA significantly preserved vaginal tissue architecture and prevented vaginal inflammation, proving its efficacy for the management of RVVC. Moreover, the combination of PP, GS, and LA notably increased azole efficacy by adding a new mechanism of action when administered concomitantly. CONCLUSION: Taken together, results demonstrated that the treatment with a combination of PP, GS, and LA is able to reduce the adhesion of C. albicans."

In particular, IBS associated with constipation (IBS-C) is characterized by hard and dry stools and inadequate evacuation and difficulty in defecation. Although several drugs ameliorate intestinal modifications and constipation-associated features, management of IBS is still a challenge. Natural compounds including Xyloglucan and pea protein (XP) and Chia seed powder (CS) are widely known to possess beneficial effects in counteracting several gastrointestinal disorders. Here, we aimed to assess the combined effects of XP and CS to treat constipation-related alterations in an IBS-C rat model. IBS-C was induced by gastric instillation of 2 mL of cold water (0-4 °C) for 14 days and Xiloglucan, Pea protein and Chia seeds (XP + CS) treatment was orally administered for 7 days. On day 22, colon tissues were collected for histological analysis. Our results showed that XP + CS administration attenuated constipation-related parameters by increasing body weight and food and water intake. Upon XP + CS treatment, from day 14 to 22, stool moisture content was restored to physiological level. Colonic tissues from IBS-C rats depicted a disruption of the organ architecture accompanied by edema. Loss of colonic structure was reflected by the marked reduction of tight junction protein expression, Occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). Administration of XP + CS treatment in IBS-C rats significantly ameliorated the colonic histological parameters and exerted a positive effect on barrier integrity by restoring the expression of Occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). Our findings demonstrated that the efficacy of XP and CS in managing constipation in rats is due to the ability of these compounds to form a protective barrier fortifying intestinal integrity and gut functionality."

With the increase of OSA-LD content, the average diameter of composite particles decreased due to the avoidance of hydrophobic aggregation between PPINs during heating, and the composite particles became more compact and regular. The high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) stabilized by composite particles exhibited smaller droplet size, higher viscosity and modulus attributing to the formation of denser interfacial layer. The results of low field nuclear magnetic resonance proved that the HIPEs stabilized by composite particles showed more uniform distribution of water and oil. This work provided a facile method to fabricate composite particles, which had excellent capacity to stabilize the HIPEs.",

      "abstract": "Preparation of pea protein isolate-xylan (PPI-X) conjugate-stabilized nanoemulsions using ultrasonic homogenization and the corresponding structure and environmental stability were investigated in this study. Conditions used to prepare nanoemulsions were optimized using a response surface methodology as follows: protein concentration 8.86 mg/mL, ultrasound amplitudes 57 % (370.5 W), and ultrasound time 16 min. PPI-X conjugate-stabilized nanoemulsions formed under these conditions exhibited less mean droplet size (189.4 ± 0.45 nm), more uniform droplet distribution, greater absolute value of zeta-potential (44.8 ± 0.22 mV), and higher protein adsorption content compared with PPI-stabilized nanoemulsions. PPI-X conjugate-stabilized nanoemulsions also exhibited even particle distribution and dense network structure, which might be reasons for the observed high interfacial protein adsorption content of conjugate-stabilized nanoemulsions. Moreover, better stability against environmental stresses, such as thermal treatment, freeze-thaw treatment, ionic strength and type, and storage time was also observed for the conjugate-stabilized nanoemulsions, indicating that this type of nanoemulsions possess a potential to endure harsh food processing conditions. Therefore, results provide a novel approach for the preparation of protein-polysaccharide conjugate-stabilized nanoemulsions to be applied as novel ingredients to meet special requirements of processed foods.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing interest in using plant-derived proteins in foods and beverages for environmental, health, and ethical reasons. However, the inherent physicochemical properties and functional performance of many plant proteins limit their widespread application. Here, we prepared pea protein isolate (PPI) dispersions using a combined pH-shift/heat treatment method, and then, prepared PPI-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) complexes under neutral conditions. Spectroscopy, calorimetry, molecular docking, and light scattering analysis demonstrated that the molecular complexes formed spontaneously. This was primarily ascribed to hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. The complexation of EGCG caused changes in the secondary structure of PPI, including the reduction in the α-helix and increase in the β-sheet and disordered regions. These changes slightly decreased the thermal stability of the protein. With the accretion of EGCG, the hydrophilicity of the complexes increased significantly, which improved the functional attributes of the protein. Optimization of the PPI-to-EGCG ratio led to the complexes having better foaming and emulsifying properties than the protein alone. This study could broaden the utilization of pea proteins as functional ingredients in foods. Moreover, protein-polyphenol complexes can be used as multifunctional ingredients, such as antioxidants or nutraceutical emulsifiers."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of different ultrasonic power and ultrasonic time on the structure and emulsifying properties of pea protein isolate (PPI)-arabinose conjugates. An examination of the absorbance and color development of PPI-d-arabinose (Ara) conjugates found that compared with traditional heating, the degree of glycosylation of protein reached the maximum when the ultrasonic treatment power was 150 and the treatment time was 30 min. Structural analysis revealed that the content of disordered structures (β-turn and random coil) of the protein conjugates increased, the maximum emission wavelength of the fluorescence spectrum was red-shifted, and the UV second-order derivative values decreased. The protein structure unfolded, exposing more hydrophobic groups on the molecular surface. Ultrasonic treatment improved the emulsification of protein conjugates. The emulsifying activity index (EAI) increased to 19.7 and 19.3 m2/g, and the emulsifying stability index (ESI) also increased. The contact angle and zeta potential also demonstrate that ultrasonic power has a positive effect on emulsion stability. Based on examining the thermal stability of the emulsion, the ultrasonic treatment increased the thermal denaturation resistance of the protein. This result confirms that mild sonication can increase the degree of glycosylation reaction and improve the emulsification properties of protein-Ara conjugates, providing a theoretical basis for developing foods with excellent emulsification properties.",

Fluorescence analysis demonstrated that the binding affinity declined in sequence of QUE > CUR > RES and about one polyphenol compound was bound to protein. Thermodynamic parameters revealed that hydrophobic interaction was mainly responsible for complexation between CUR/RES and PPI, while hydrogen bonding for QUE with PPI. All nanoparticles showed particle size of 154-159 nm. Three lipophilic polyphenols were successfully encapsulated into PPI, with loading capacity of RES > QUE > CUR. Complexation of three polyphenols did not change the secondary structure of PPI. Results of FTIR, DSC and XRD confirmed that polyphenols changed from crystalline to amorphous state after combination with PPI. SEM pictures exhibited regular spherical microstructure of nanocomplexes. PPI shielded polyphenols from sensitive environment of ultraviolet light and thermal treatment. ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activity of polyphenols were considerably improved through complexation with PPI. Molecular docking studies showed binding energy with 11S legumin in sequence of QUE > RES > CUR, and stronger hydrogen bonds were built between QUE and the protein than the other two polyphenols. Data in the present work may provide helpful information for encapsulation of lipophilic polyphenols with pea protein and the potential application in food science, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries in the future.",

In this study, the transglutaminase (TG) treatments on the structure of pea protein isolate (PPI) under conditions relevant to high-moisture extrusion processing (50 wt% PPI at 30°C, 120°C and heated to 120°C and subsequently cooled to 30°C) was studied by using a closed cavity rheometer. Strain and frequency sweeping were carried out under various temperature conditions, and the information obtained was drawn into a texture map. Lissajous curves combined with energy dissipation ratio were introduced to characterize the nonlinear response of the samples. The results showed that the storage modulus of PPI increased with the increase of TG concentration during heat treatment. After cooling to 30°C, PPI with 0.25-1%TG could enhance the elasticity, but treating by 2% TG could inhibit the formation of disulfide bonds, the uniform development of the protein network, thus showing the \"tough\" character. These findings can help to better understand the relationships of material-structure during the extrusion process, and also provide help for further optimization of the quality of meat substitutes."

Enzymatic modification treatment distinctly boosted the solubility of PP. The solubility of PP treated by trypsin was increased from 10.23% to 58.14% at the 8% DH. The results of SDS-PAGE indicated the protease broke disulfide bonds, degraded protein into small molecular peptides, and transformed insoluble protein into soluble fractions with the increased DH. After enzymatic treatment, a bathochromic shift and increased intrinsic fluorescence were observed for PP. Furthermore, the total sulfhydryl group contents and surface hydrophobicity were reduced, suggesting that the unfolding of PP occurred. Meanwhile, the foaming and emulsification of PP were improved after enzymatic treatment, and the most remarkable effect was observed under 6% DH. Moreover, under the same DH, the influence on the structure and functional properties of PP from large to small are trypsin, alcalase, neutrase and flavourzyme. This result will facilitate the formulation and production of natural plant-protein-based products using PP."

This study investigates the effect of high-intensity ultrasound (HIU, 0-600 W) and pH-shifting treatment, alone or combined, on the structure, solubility, and emulsification of PPI, as well as its potential mechanism. The results revealed that the PPI solubility significantly increases when treated with the combination, corresponding to a decrease in the protein particle size, especially at 500 W of HIU power (p < 0.05). Correspondingly, the emulsion prepared from it was less prone to phase separation during storage. According to the structural analysis, the structural changes caused by protein unfolding (i.e., the exposure of hydrophobic and polar sites and the loss of the α-helix) seemed to be the primary reasons for increased PPI solubility. In addition, confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that the combination treatment accelerated the adsorption of PPI at the oil/water interface and strengthened the compactness of the interface film. Improved interfacial properties and intermolecular forces played a critical role in the resistance to droplet coalescence in PPI emulsion. In conclusion, ultrasound and pH-shifting treatments have a synergistic effect on improving the solubility and emulsification of PPI.",

A higher sonication amplitude and longer time improved the protein solubility and surface hydrophobicity and reduced the particle size of GPPI. These physicochemical alterations in GPPI enhanced the protein adsorption at the oil-water interface, reduced the interfacial tension and increased the EAI and ESI values. SDS-page demonstrated that sonication did not change the primary structure of the protein. However, CD spectroscopy indicated a reduction in α-helix and an increase in the content of β-sheet and random coil structures in the sonicated GPPI. The free SH groups content and UV-vis absorbance intensity increased after the sonication. However, prolonged sonication up to 20 min reduced the free SH content in GPPI due to the oxidation of susceptible SH groups. HIU increased the thermal degradation of GPPI and lowered the least concentration needed for gelatinization of GPPI (LGC). Therefore, less protein powder was needed to form a strong gel compared to the non-sonicated GPPI. Sonicated GPPIs showed higher gel strength especially when 75% amplitude used for 10 min. These results showed that the HIU is a promising approach for modification of the functional properties of GPPI for food applications.",

The tensile strength and elongation at break were increased from 0.76 MPa to 1.33 MPa and from 96% to 197%, respectively, after treatment at 240 MPa. This improvement was due to the enhanced protein-protein and protein-glycerol hydrogen bonding as evidenced by FTIR. Increased β-sheet and decreased α-helix by HPH was also observed, and β-sheet was highly correlated to film tensile strength (Pearson coefficient of 0.973, P < 0.01).

Protocol 1 consisted of a heat treatment (85 °C for 1 h) of CM-PP and CM-WP mixtures, respectively. Regarding protocol 2, casein micelle, pea protein and whey protein stock dispersions were individually pretreated by heating (85 °C for 1 h) before the mixtures were made and heated in the same conditions of protocol 1 (85 °C for 1 h). Heat pretreatment carried out in the protocol 2 significantly increased PP hydrophobicity and reinforced weak interactions of the initial pea protein particles. This pretreatment on protein stock dispersions led to twofold smaller pea protein particles compared to whey protein aggregates. The hydrophobic interactions between pea proteins and casein micelles promoted by the two heating protocols have greatly contributed to improve acid gelation functionalities of CM. Regardless of the heating protocol, acid-induced gelation of the CM-PP mixtures led to the formation of gel networks with a significant increase in stiffness and firmness compared to casein micelle or CM-WP mixtures gels.",

Scanning electron microscopy showed that FT5 had a compact structure like PPC while FT3, FT7, and FT9 contained a more continuous network. In comparison to PPC, the >50 kDa fractions showed improved solubility (>60%), oil holding capacity (~100%), protein content (~7%), foam capacity (>10%), foam stability (>7%), water holding capacity (>16%) and surface hydrophobicity (~50%).

Heating dispersions of pea flour and mild protein fractions reduced the trypsin inhibitory activity to levels similar to that of the protein isolate. Protein-rich and non-soluble protein fractions were up to 18% better hydrolysed after being thermally denatured, particularly for proteins emptied later in the gastric phase. The degree of hydrolysis throughout the digestion was similar for these heated fractions and the conventional isolate. Further heating of the protein isolate reduced its digestibility as much as 9%. Protein solubility enhances the digestibility of native proteins, while heating aggregates the proteins, which ultimately reduces the achieved extent of hydrolysis from gastro-small intestinal enzymes.",

This study reports a pea protein pre-treatment that combines atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) and pH-shifting to improve pea protein gelling property. Specifically, the pea protein concentrate was treated by ACP at pH 12 for 10 min, followed by pH-shifting to neutral and spray-drying to prepare PPCtreated powders. Although, pea protein concentrate did not form a self-standing gel until 95 °C for 60 min, PPCtreated suspension (14 wt%) formed gels with good mechanical properties (compressive strength: 2.81 kPa) by heating at 70 °C within 10-20 min. The strength of the gel made from PPCtreated was further increased to 3.70 and 5.53 kPa when raising the temperature to 80 and 90 °C, respectively. The protein characterizations revealed that the combined ACP and pH-shifting treatment partially unfolded pea protein by altering the tertiary structure, and then the active species produced by ACP facilitated the formation of protein aggregates with increased surface hydrophobicity. During heating, the aggregates served as active building blocks to form more ordered three-dimensional gel networks via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The greatly increased gel strength and the powder form will allow pea protein to be widely used as a gelling ingredient in many food formulations. The capacity to form gels at a reduced temperature than pea protein denaturation temperature (∼95 °C) will enable food texture development by conventional cooking.",

      "abstract": "The interaction between fish skin gelatin (FG) and pea protein isolate (PPI) was investigated at the air-water interface (A-W) before and after a high intensity (275 W, 5 min) ultrasound treatment (US). We analyzed the properties of the single protein suspensions as well as an equal ratio of FG:PPI (MIX), in terms of ζ-potential, particle size, molecular weight, bulk viscosity and interfacial tension. The foaming properties were then evaluated by visual analysis and by Turbiscan Tower. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was employed to explore the role of the proteins on the microstructure of foams. The results showed that the ultrasound treatment slightly influenced physicochemical properties of the proteins, while in general, did not significantly affect their behavior both in bulk and at the air-water interface. In particular, PPI aggregate size was reduced (-48 nm) while their negative charges were increased (-1 mV) after the treatment. However, when the proteins were combined, higher molecular weight of aggregates, higher foam stability values (+14%) and lower interfacial tension (IFT) values (47.2 ± 0.2 mN/m) were obtained, leading us to assume that a weak interaction was developed between them."

      "abstract": "The application of pea proteins in the food industry is often limited by their poor functional properties, such as solubility, emulsification, and gelation. To address this problem, a novel method of constructing pea protein-inulin conjugates with improved functional attributes was developed, which consisted of combining a high-intensity ultrasonic treatment with a pH-shift wet heating method. This combined method promoted the Maillard reaction, leading to a grafting degree that was 2.3-times higher than that of the traditional wet heating method. SDS-PAGE confirmed the formation of pea protein-inulin conjugates. The pea protein-inulin conjugates had higher solubility than pea proteins alone, especially around the isoelectric point of the protein. Furthermore, the thermal stability, antioxidant activity, foaming and emulsifying properties of the conjugates were better than those of the protein. This study shows that the combined ultrasound/pH-shift wet heating method is highly effective at improving the functional properties of pea proteins.",

      "abstract": "Functional abdominal bloating and distension (FABD) are common and frequent symptoms in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. FABD is characterized by recurrent abdominal fullness and bloating. The pathophysiology of FABD is still unclear. However, the plausible mechanisms involved are small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), imbalance of gut microbiota, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal permeability alteration, and disruption of intestinal barrier function. Thus, the creation of a barrier on the wall of the intestine could represent an alternative therapeutic strategy to prevent FABD. This study aimed to investigate the effect of two natural substances, Xyloglucan (XG) and Pea-protein (PP), known for their mucosal-protective properties, in an in vivo model of Partial restraint-stress (PRS). Our results showed that the pre-treatment with a product containing XG and PP in stressed-rats was able to reduce the number of abdominal contractions and visceral hypersensitivity. Moreover, XG and PP were able to reduce intestinal permeability alteration, restoring tight-junctions (TJs) expression and decreased the lactulose-mannitol ratio, a quantitative marker used to measure intestinal permeability, compared to PRS-group. In conclusion, the data obtained revealed that the product containing XG and PP was able to restore the normal intestinal-barrier function; therefore, it could be considered a therapeutic strategy to manage FABD.",

The aim of this work was to investigate the conservation of pea protein isolate (PPI) during time and especially the evolution of their organoleptic quality under two storage conditions. The evolution of the volatile compounds, the odor and the color of a PPI has been investigated during one year of storage. PPI was exposed to two treatments mimicking a lack of control of storage conditions: treatment A with light exposition at ambient temperature (A-Light 20 °C) and treatment B in the dark but with a higher temperature (B-Dark 30 °C). For each sampling time (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 months), the volatile compounds were determined using HS-SPME-GC-MS, the odor using direct sniffing, and the color using the measurement of L*, a*, b* parameters. Treatment A was the most deteriorating and led to a strong increase in the total volatile compounds amount, an odor deterioration, and a color change. Furthermore, a tentative correlation between instrumental data on volatile compounds and the perceived odor was proposed. By the representation of volatile compounds sorted by their sensory descriptor, it could be possible to predict an odor change with analytical data.",

In this study, lactic acid bacteria fermentation or enzymatic hydrolysis was performed on pea protein concentrates (PPCs) to investigate their effects on the bioaccessibility of fortified Fe and Zn salts. Simulated digestion studies revealed that enzymatic hydrolysis was more effective than fermentation. Phytase treatment significantly (P < 0.05) improved Fe3+ bioaccessibility by 5- and 12-fold during fasted and fed digestion stages, respectively. Combined phytase and protease hydrolysis led to a 6- and 15-fold enhancement of Fe3+ bioaccessibility during these stages. None of the bioprocessing approaches led to significant promotive effects on Zn2+ bioaccessibility during fasted or fed digestion.

The intrinsic mechanisms of the reactions at different concentrations were specifically examined. With an increase in Arg concentration, the scavenging activities of ABTS+˙ and ˙OH and the Fe2+ chelating activity of PPI increased significantly (P < 0.05). The addition of Arg (0%-0.2%) significantly modified the PPI structure, causing an increase in protein solubility (from 66.2% to 79.0%) and a decrease in protein particle size (from 682 nm to 361 nm) (P < 0.05). In addition, treatment with Arg (0%-0.2%) effectively improved the emulsifying activity of PPI (by 28%), decreased the droplet size and viscosity of the emulsion, and enhanced the physical and oxidation stabilities of the emulsion. The increase in interfacial protein content and the absolute value of ζ-potential, and the microscopy images also showed that 0%-0.2% Arg treatment helped in forming a uniform and stable microemulsion. In contrast, a high concentration (0.5%-1.0%) of Arg diminished its positive effect on the emulsifying properties of PPI. Therefore, treatment with an appropriate concentration of Arg can significantly improve the emulsifying activity of PPI and enhance the stability of the emulsions.",

HPP-treated PPC underwent a greater degree of proteolysis and showed different peptide patterns after static gastric digestion compared to untreated and heat-treated PPC. Differences in protein digestibility among treatments during dynamic digestion were only significant (p < 0.05) during the first 20 min of jejunal, ileal, and total digestion for 5 P, and during the first 60 min of ileal digestion for 15 P. Neither static nor dynamic starch digestibility were dependent on treatment. HPP did not reduce trypsin inhibitor activity, whereas heat treatment reduced it by ~70%. HPP-induced structural modifications of proteins and starch did not affect their overall in vitro digestibility but enhanced gastric proteolysis."

The order in which the treatments were performed had a major impact on the changes in the properties of the pea protein isolate; the highest changes were seen with the combination of fermentation followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. SDS-PAGE, gel filtration, and ELISA results showed changes in the protein molecular weight and a reduced immunogenicity of treated samples. Treated samples showed significantly increased protein solubility at pH 4.5 (31.19-66.55%) and at pH 7.0 (47.37-74.95%), compared to the untreated PPI (6.98% and 40.26%, respectively). The foaming capacity was significantly increased (1190-2575%) compared to the untreated PPI (840%). The treated PPI showed reduced pea characteristic off-flavors, where only the treatment with Esperase® significantly increased the bitterness. The results from this study suggest that the combination of enzymatic hydrolysis and lactic fermentation is a promising method to be used in the food industry to produce pea protein ingredients with higher functionality and a highly neutral taste. A reduced detection signal of polyclonal rabbit anti-pea-antibodies against the processed protein preparations in ELISA furthermore might indicate a decreased immunological reaction after consumption."

Given that food safety must remain paramount for producers and manufacturers, research into novel, natural food preservation solutions which can help to ensure food safety and protect against spoilage is on the rise. In this work, we investigated the potential of using a novel protein hydrolysate, produced by the enzymatic hydrolysis of Pisum sativum (PSH), as a novel bio-preservative and its abilities to reduce populations of Escherichia coli O157:H7 after inoculation on a lettuce leaf. While unhydrolyzed P. sativum proteins show no antimicrobial activity, once digested, and purified, the enzymatically released peptides induced in vitro bactericidal effects on the foodborne pathogen at 8 mg/ml. When applied on an infected lettuce leaf, the PSH significantly reduced the number of bacteria recovered after 2 hr of treatment. PSH may be preferred over other preservation strategies based on its natural, inexpensive, sustainable source, environmentally friendly process, nontoxic nature, good batch to batch consistency, and ability to significantly reduce counts of E. coli both in vitro and in a lettuce leaf."

Ultrasound induced unfolding of PPI and exposed interior hydrophobic groups to protein surface while both PPI dissociation and formation of large aggregates were observed, as confirmed by measuring intrinsic emission fluorescence, surface hydrophobicity, surface charge, and particle size distribution and polydispersity index, respectively. FE-SEM showed that ultrasound decreased the cracks and protein aggregates at the surface of PPI-film. The film structure was also investigated by FTIR, which showed peak shift in amide I and II region and noticeable difference of protein secondary structure as affected by ultrasound. As a result of such structural changes caused by ultrasound, the properties of PPI-films were improved. Results showed that ultrasound greatly improved the film transparency, significantly increased film tensile strength but not elongation at break, and decreased moisture content and water vapor permeability of the film. This study provided structural data as evidence for utilizing ultrasound technique to develop PPI-films with improved optical, mechanical and water barrier properties.",

All reactive species induced protein denaturation and the formation of disulfide-linked soluble aggregates. A significant increase in surface hydrophobicity and β-sheet content was only induced by treatment with O3 and OH. These specific changes resulted in significant enhancement in gelation and emulsification.

No significant differences were found in morphometric measurements for pyloric caecum and intestines among treatment groups, whereas the number of the caecum of fish fed the PP25 diets significantly increased over the control (PP0) (p<0.05). In the histological examination of the liver, mild hydropic and vacuolar degeneration was observed in all experimental groups except PP0 and PP25. The measurements of pyloric caecum fold height, enterocyte length and width of tunica muscularis of the high-level pea protein groups of PP75 and PP100 were significantly higher (p <0.05) compared to the control group.

Aeration activity of BPP in cream was 1.5-fold that of NPP. Although the overrun value was smaller than SMP cream, the BPP cream retained the stable shape and had a slow melting rate due to its interactive dimensional network of fat.

The photo and thermal stability of β-carotene and its bioaccessibility during digestion were also analyzed. Comparing to the emulsions stabilized by other complexes, the emulsion stabilized by the high methoxyl pectin-rhamnolipid-pea protein isolate-curcumin (HMP-Rha-PPI-Cur) complex had the smallest droplet size (17.53 ± 0.15 μm) and the maximum encapsulation efficiency for curcumin (90.33 ± 0.03 %) and β-carotene (92.16 ± 0.01 %). The emulsion stabilized by the HMP-Rha-PPI-Cur complex exhibited better physical stability against creaming. The retention rate of β-carotene in the HMP-Rha-PPI-Cur complex-stabilized emulsion was 17.75 ± 0.02 and 33.64 ± 0.02 % after UV irradiation and thermal treatment. The HMP-Rha-PPI-Cur complex-stabilized emulsion also had a higher level of free fatty acid released (43.67 %) and higher bioaccessibility of β-carotene (32.35 ± 0.02 %).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a frequent problem associated with a significant socioeconomic implication. Increased gut permeability is an important pathophysiological mechanism. A medical device containing xyloglucan (XG), pea protein and tannins (PPT) from grape-seed extract, and xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) has proven restoration of intestinal barrier function. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with the medical device XG + PPT + XOS (XG-PPT-XOS) in adult patients with IBS-D in a clinical setting for 6 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a multicentre, open-label, prospective, observational study conducted to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of XG-PPT-XOS. IBS-D adult patients (Rome IV criteria) were included and received two tablets twice daily for 6 months. IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) and bowel habit were registered at baseline and monthly, until the end of follow up. Efficacy was evaluated by comparison of mean scores at each time point. RESULTS: 50 patients were included, of which 19 completed the 6 months. IBS-SSS score decreased from 312.2 ± 82.2 to 213.6 ± 109.9 (p < 0.0001) at 1 month and 192.0 ± 108.9 at the last visit completed; diarrhoea score decreased from 45.6 ± 17.9 to 25.7 ± 17.7 and 25.3 ± 17.2 at 1 month and at the last visit completed, respectively. Pain score decreased from 107.8 ± 49.9 at baseline to 73.2 ± 57.3 (p < 0.0001) at 1 month and bloating score from 56.4 ± 28.8 at baseline to 42.8 ± 32.6 (p < 0.001) at 1 month, reaching 62.4 ± 56.0 and 40.4 ± 34.3, respectively, at the last visit completed. Adverse effects were mild and mostly not related to treatment. CONCLUSION: Treating IBS-D patients with XG-PPT-XOS is effective and safe in the long term within a clinical setting, improving all IBS-D symptoms from the first month of treatment and showing a sustained response over the term of therapy."

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a bone disease affecting more than 2 million people comprising 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men in Canada. One possible approach to prevent this disease is to stimulate the activity of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) using food protein-derived bioactive peptides. In our previous study, an ACE inhibitory tripeptide LRW (Leu-Arg-Trp) was identified from pea protein. This work aims to investigate the effect of tripeptide LRW on promoting osteoblastic activity. The tripeptide LRW treatment (50 μM) in MC3T3-E1 cells increased cell proliferation (4-fold increase) as indicated by BrdU incorporation assay. Moreover, we found that tripeptide LRW stimulated osteoblastic differentiation by increasing the levels of type 1 collagen (COL1A2; 3-fold increase), alkaline phosphatase (ALP; 4-fold increase), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2; 2-fold increase) and the activation of the protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. Furthermore, tripeptide LRW increased matrix mineralization as evidenced by Alizarin-S red staining and nodule formation, osteoprotegerin levels (OPG; 2-fold increase), and wound healing based on cell migration assay. Overall, pea protein-derived bioactive peptide LRW can positively modulate the activity of osteoblasts probably via the Akt/Runx2 pathway, indicating its potential use for the prevention of osteoporosis.",

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin, characterized by dryness and more or less severe itching. The etiology of AD is complex and has not been fully clarified, involving genetic susceptibility, immunological abnormalities, epidermal barrier dysfunction, and environmental factors. Xyloglucan (XG) and pea protein (PP) are two compounds of natural origin characterized by the ability to create a physical barrier that protects mucosae membranes, reducing inflammation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of XG + PP in both a mouse model of AD and Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus) infection- associated AD. Mice were topically treated with 200 μL of 0.5% oxazolone on the dorsal skin three times a week for AD induction. Mice received XG and PP by topical administration 1 h before oxazolone treatment. In S. aureus infection-associated AD, to induce a superficial superinfection of the skin, mice were also treated with 5 μL of 108 of a culture of S. aureus for 2 weeks; mice superinfected received XG and PP by topical administration 1 h before oxazolone + S. aureus. Four weeks later, the skin was removed for histological and biochemical analysis. Our results demonstrated the protective barrier effects of XG and PP characterized by a reduction in histological tissue changes, mastocyte degranulation, and tight junction permeability in the skin following oxazolone treatment. Moreover, XG + PP was able to preserve filaggrin expression, a hallmark of AD. Our data also support the effectiveness of XG + PP to reduce the damage by superinfection post AD induced by S. aureus. In conclusion, a future product containing XG and PP could be considered as a potentially interesting approach for the treatment of AD.",

      "abstract": "In this study the potential of aqueous solvent washing on removing off-flavours in air classified pea protein-enriched flour (PPEF) was investigated. Unpleasant flavour compounds are one of the main deterrents to the application of pulses. PPEF was treated with ethanol or isopropanol at three different concentrations (20%, 50%, and 80%) to remove the volatiles related to unpleasant beany, earthy and astringent flavours. Headspace solid phase microextraction followed by GC-MS was used to identify the flavour compounds in untreated and treated PPEF. Besides the flavour profile, changes to their proximate composition, colour, functionality and protein quality were compared among untreated and treated samples. Higher concentrations of ethanol and isopropanol (50% and 80%) showed greater effectiveness in removing flavour compounds by reducing the total peak area by 82%-94%. Protein content in all treated samples (58.2%-64.3% d.b.) increased compared to untreated PPEF (55.5%) as a result of purification due to the decrease in ash, lipid and carbohydrate content. However, alcohol treatment reduced the protein solubility and oil holding capacity in all samples by 38.3%-75.9%, and 16.7%-30.2%, respectively. Although in vitro protein digestibility was improved with the solvent treatments, the amino acid scores of those samples became lower (i.e., reduced levels of methionine, cysteine or tryptophan) resulting in up to a 27.8% reduction in in vitro protein digestibility correct amino acid scores. Both ethanol and isopropanol at 50% and 80% concentration proved to be effective in removing flavour compounds in PPEF with some modifications on the chemical compositions, protein functionalities and quality.",

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) profiling revealed that the current glutaminase treatment did not change the basic protein subunit composition. However, it allowed a certain extent of protein unfolding and conformational reorganization to generate more flexible and extended proteins with reduced average particle size and more hydrophobic groups exposed. The underlying mechanisms might include the reduction of β-sheets and antiparallel β-sheets and the increase of the β-turn structure. Moreover, the treatment time was of importance. A 12 h treatment was generally better than a 24 h treatment, and PPI treated with glutaminase at 50 °C for 12 h to a degree of deamidation of 56.1% exhibited significantly improved solubility, homogeneity, dispersibility, and suspendability with reduced beany flavor, grittiness, and lumpiness (compared to those of the untreated PPI). Thus, the glutaminase treatment offers a promising approach for enhancing the usability and applicability of pea proteins.",

Highest CUR loading amount (LA, 33.19 μg/mg) was obtained in CUR-PPI-HMP complex. Hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding were the prime driving forces for ternary complex formation.

Excellent physical stability with PPI-HMP and CUR-PPI-HMP was observed.

Here, we report the bactericidal properties of NuriPep 1653, a novel 22 mer and non-modified peptide. NuriPep 1653 was identified within the sequence of the non-antimicrobial P54 protein, which is involved in nutrient reservoir activity in Pisum sativum. Total bacterial clearance of Acinetobacter baumannii cells (1 × 108 cells/mL) was observed using only 4 × MIC (48 μg/mL) of NuriPep 1653 after just 20 min of treatment. We uncovered a synergistic interaction between NuriPep 1653 and another antimicrobial peptide, colistin. The MIC of NuriPep 1653 and colistin dropped from 12 and 8 μg/mL to 2 and 1 μg/mL, respectively, when they were combined. NuriPep 1653 exhibits no cytotoxicity in different human cell lines and has a low propensity to induce bacterial resistance in a colistin resistant clinical isolate of A. baumannii. The existence of these peptides embedded in proteins unearths potentially new classes of antimicrobials with activity against clinically relevant pathogens. Our findings push the boundaries of traditional peptide discovery and represent a leading edge for natural bioactive compounds which may have a common existence in nature but remain unexposed."

All main factors had substantial effects on the tested dependent variables. Shearing at 1500 s-1 significantly improved the solubility and heat stability of 4% PPI at pH 6.8 or 7.5 and IS-100 or 200 mM by 27-43% in comparison to 100 s-1. Following 1500 s-1 treatment, all PPI dispersions showed >85% solubility and heat stability except 4% PPI at pH 6.8 and IS 100 mM (60%). Shearing appeared to alter structural and physicochemical properties of pea proteins as well nature of protein aggregation. Heating accompanied with 100 s-1 shearing mostly resulted in insoluble covalent aggregates while shearing at 1500 s-1 mainly contributed to formation of soluble hydrophobic aggregates.",

In this article, a nanoplatform (AuNCs/PPI-ICG nanohybrid) with a theranostic effect was prepared using indocyanine green (ICG), a cyanine dye with bright near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and excellent photodynamic and photothermal performance, and it was loaded onto gold nanoclusters/pea protein isolate hybrid nanoparticles (AuNCs/PPI NPs). There was a linear relationship between ICG loading ratio and the concentration, within a concentration range of 0-5 mg/mL, making it possible to precisely control the concentration of loaded ICG. In addition, the AuNCs/PPI-ICG nanohybrid displayed outstanding loading stability and enhanced the aqueous stability of ICG, owing to the protectivity of AuNCs/PPI NPs. In vitro cell experiments showed that this biocompatible nanohybrid could be taken up by A549 cells and used as a fluorescent bioimaging probe. Moreover, because of Au, AuNCs/PPI NPs could also act as a potential computed tomographic (CT) contrast agent, and so the AuNCs/PPI-ICG nanohybrid had the potential to function as a dual-modal imaging agent. Finally, the as-prepared hybrid, with excellent photodynamic properties and exceptional photothermal capabilities, showed a satisfactory therapeutic effect in ablating A549 cancer cells. These results convincingly demonstrate that the AuNCs/PPI-ICG nanohybrid is a promising theranostic nanoplatform for NIRF/CT dual-modal imaging and for synergistic photodynamic therapy/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT)."

In addition, the emulsion properties (particle and droplet size, flocculation, coalescence, zeta potential, hydrophobicity and creaming index) of PPC emulsions before and after UHT treatment were measured. The overall heat transfer coefficient (OHTC) versus time graphs were stable during UHT processing for both microfluidised and ultrasonicated PPC emulsions that indicates no fouling and good stability under the thermal treatment condition. Freshly prepared emulsion using 0.5 and 1.0% PPC and ultrasonicated for 5 min showed creaming index of 5.73 and 8.39%, particle size of 0.96 and 1.53 μm respectively. In addition, the fat droplet size for the above samples measured 1.05 and 1.85 μm for larger fat droplets and 0.51 and 0.72 μm for smaller fat droplets, respectively. However, after UHT treatment this emulsion destabilised due to protein aggregation as indicated by the high flocculation index (13.22 and 103.35%), particle size (1.59 and 3.23 μm) and droplet size (1.30 and 2.53 μm, for large fat droplets and 0.90 and 1.22 μm, for small fat droplets). After UHT treatment the microfluidised PPC emulsion using 0.5 and 1.0% PPC were the most stable with small particle size (2.85 and 0.36 μm), high zeta potential (-56.36 and - 27.30) and low creaming index (3.87% and 4.97%), respectively as compared to ultrasonicated samples. Overall, this study revealed that UHT treatment improved emulsion properties of the microfluidised PPC emulsion compared to the ultrasonicated PPC emulsion.",
