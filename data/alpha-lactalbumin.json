      "abstract": "Research on oleogels has a health and sustainability imperative for reducing saturated-fat intake. Herein, the physicochemical properties of whey protein aggregates (WPA) with α-lactalbumin (α-La) addition (5-10 %), ultrasonication (1-2 min), and heating process (85-95 °C), and consequently, the functional characteristics of WPA-based oleogels (WPO) and their potential for replacing commercial butter were investigated. More α-La incorporation and longer ultrasonication increased the hydrogen bonding and β-sheet (34 %-50 %), while reduced random coil of WPA (27 %-11 %), which promoted WPA formation, increased WPA structural density, and led to a decline in particle size of WPA driven by surface hydrophobicity decrease. Therefore, the WPO exhibited excellent oil-holding capacity, thermal stability, viscoelasticity and spreadability. WPO consisted of 95 °C-heated WPA with 5 % α-La addition or 1 min-ultrasonication showed textural and rheological behavior similar to butter. These results contribute to the formulation of whey protein oleogels with controlled physicochemical and functional properties, showing potential being applied as fat substitutes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver fibrosis is a serious global health issue, but current treatment options are limited due to a lack of approved therapies capable of preventing or reversing established fibrosis. AIM: This study investigated the antifibrotic effects of a synthetic peptide derived from α-lactalbumin in a mouse model of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis. METHODS: In silico analyses were conducted to assess the physicochemical properties, pharmacophore features, and docking interactions of the peptide. Mice with induced fibrosis were treated with three different doses of the synthetic peptide (2.5, 5, or 10 μg/kg, twice weekly for 8 weeks). Immunohistochemistry, antioxidant enzyme levels, IGF-1 levels, and expression of fibrosis-related genes were assessed. RESULTS: Peptide interacted with human prothrombin's many sites with varying binding affinities. Besides, ligand similarity analysis identified 26 thrombin inhibitors with high Tanimoto scores. The peptide exhibited antifibrotic effects with dose-dependent improvements. The upregulated expression of IGF-1 in all treated groups compared with the pathological untreated group. In contrast, fibrotic markers such as TIMP, PDGF-α, and TGF-β were upregulated in the untreated pathological group but downregulated in the peptide-treated groups. The assessment of IGF-1 concentration in sera demonstrated that the peptide-treated groups exhibited an increase in IGF-1 levels. Histopathological examination of peptide-treated groups showed normal hepatic architecture with hepatocytes arranged in thin plates. Immunohistochemical results of high dose peptide-treated group showed a few numbers of positive αSMA with mild proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. CONCLUSION: The synthetic α-lactalbumin peptide shows promise as an antifibrotic therapy. Its safety and effectiveness are supported by in silico and in vivo analyses. The peptide's pharmacophore characteristics and potential as a thrombin inhibitor combine with its ability to downregulate fibrotic markers and maintain liver tissue integrity. These findings concluded the potential of this peptide as a promising therapeutic candidate for liver fibrosis, warranting further investigation."

      "abstract": "Camel α-Lactalbumin (α-LACc) has been shown to exert bioactivities for Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and anti-inflammation, showing the ability to treat obesity-related metabolic disorders. Herein, we present a novel process to purify α-LACc in a single chromatographic step from camel whey in a flow-through format. We also demonstrate the role of α-LACc modulation strategies for the treatment of obesity. An in-vivo study was systematically carried-out, in which an intragastric administration of α-LACc in rats experiencing obesity showed ameliorating effect on hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia. In addition, we demonstrated that the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress by α-LACc was effective, and importantly, the enhancement of antioxidant defenses was achieved. Furthermore, we found that the peroxynitrite scavenging ability of α-LACc could help restore the hepatorenal function. Finally, we showed that α-LACc could improve insulin resistance-associated glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity disorders caused by obesity. This work has developed a novel one-step purification process of α-LACc from camel whey without the use of organic solvents. Our purified α-LACc may serve as a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of obesity-related metabolic disorders by synergistically alleviating lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "Interruption of wound healing by multi-drug resistant-bacterial infection is a harmful issue for the worldwide health care system, and conventional treatment approaches may not resolve this issue due to antimicrobial resistance. So, there is an unmet need to develop scaffolds with intrinsic wound healing properties to combat bacterial-infected wounds. Inspired by the α-lactalbumin's (Lalb's) ability to promote collagen synthesis, we herein electrospun Lalb with cephalexin (CPL) and epigallocatechin (EP) to produce nanofibers (CE-Lalb NFs) to solve this issue. The CE-Lalb NFs were prepared using the electrospinning technique and subjected to physicochemical characterizations, in vitro, and in vivo assessments. The CE-Lalb NFs promoted fibroblast migration, proliferation, and collagen synthesis, while CPL/EP annihilated MRSA and E. coli infections. Physicochemical characterizations proved the successful fabrication and doping of CE-Lalb NFs. Antimicrobial assays and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) declared synergistic antibacterial activity of CE-Lalb NFs against MRSA and E. coli. The in vivo and immunohistochemical data evidenced its exceptional potential for wound healing, promoting growth factor, collagen synthesis, and reduced scar formation. The presence of mature collagen, fewer inflammatory cytokines, increased expression of blood vessels, and low expression of IL-6 at the wound site support in vitro and in vivo results. In our view, the tailored scaffold is the next step for personalized wound dressings that could meet patients with infected wounds' unmet needs by the subscription of noninvasive and easily navigable therapeutic options.",

Here, we developed α-lactalbumin mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (α-LNP) as a potential therapeutical strategy for TNBC. The α-LNP induced the specific IgG antibodies and activated IFN γ-secreting-T cells in vivo. Additionally, the safety of α-LNP also had been demonstrated in vivo. When vaccinated prior to tumor implantation, α-LNP showed a preventive effect against 4T1 tumor growth and extended the survival of the tumor model by activating the memory immune responses. Furthermore, α-LNP administration in combination with surgical removal of neoplasm effectively inhibited the progression and metastasis in the TNBC model. Taken together, our results indicate that the α-LNP vaccine is a promising novel treatment for both therapeutics and prophylactics in TNBC."

      "abstract": "High protein intake during infancy results in accelerated early weight gain and potentially later obesity. The aim of this follow-up study at 12 months was to evaluate if modified low-protein formulas fed during early infancy have long-term effects on growth and metabolism. In a double-blinded RCT, the ALFoNS study, 245 healthy-term infants received low-protein formulas with either alpha-lactalbumin-enriched whey (α-lac-EW; 1.75 g protein/100 kcal), casein glycomacropeptide-reduced whey (CGMP-RW; 1.76 g protein/100 kcal), or standard infant formula (SF; 2.2 g protein/100 kcal) between 2 and 6 months of age. Breastfed (BF) infants served as a reference. At 12 months, anthropometrics and dietary intake were assessed, and serum was analyzed for insulin, C-peptide, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Weight gain between 6 and 12 months and BMI at 12 months were higher in the SF than in the BF infants (p = 0.019; p < 0.001, respectively), but were not significantly different between the low-protein formula groups and the BF group. S-insulin and C-peptide were higher in the SF than in the BF group (p < 0.001; p = 0.003, respectively), but more alike in the low-protein formula groups and the BF group. Serum IGF-1 at 12 months was similar in all study groups. Conclusion: Feeding modified low-protein formula during early infancy seems to reduce insulin resistance, resulting in more similar growth, serum insulin, and C-peptide concentrations to BF infants at 6-months post intervention. Feeding modified low-protein formula during early infancy results in more similar growth, serum insulin, and C-peptide concentrations to BF infants 6-months post intervention, probably due to reduced insulin resistance in the low-protein groups.",

Besides pharmacological treatment, lifestyle modifications and nutraceuticals can be used to manage glucose and lipid profiles, which is crucial for preventing, or avoiding, serious consequences associated with the condition. This randomized controlled clinical trial on 75 patients with T2DM evaluated the effects of a combination of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol (40:1), α-lactalbumin, Gymnema sylvestre, and zinc on glucose and lipid profile. The intention-to-treat analysis displayed no significant differences in glucose parameters between the groups; however, the study group displayed reduced levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.01) and LDL (p = 0.03) after 3 months of supplementation. A subgroup analysis involving patients who did not modify their antidiabetic therapy, after 6 months displayed improved levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.03) and LDL (p = 0.04) in the study group versus placebo, along with a greater body weight reduction (p = 0.03) after 3 months. Furthermore, within the study group, levels of HDL (p = 0.03) and triglycerides (p = 0.04) improved after 3 months. These findings support supplementation with myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol (40:1), α-lactalbumin, Gymnema sylvestre, and zinc as an adjuvant and safe strategy to manage the lipid profiles of patients with T2DM."

So far, no definitive and approved treatment to target directly amyloid fibrils has been introduced. Nevertheless, the search for small molecules with ability to inhibit and suppress fibril formation is an active and promising area of the research. Herein, the binding interactions and inhibitory effects of myricetin and morin hydrate on the in vitro fibrillation of bovine α-lactalbumin (BLA) have been investigated. The intrinsic fluorescence of BLA was quenched by myricetin and morin hydrate through combination of the static and dynamic quenching along with non-radiative Förster energy transfer mechanisms. The binding of these two flavonoids to BLA were not accompanied by major alteration in the conformation of BLA as evidenced by CD studies. The results of the fluorescence quenching analyses indicated almost the same binding affinities of myricetin and morin hydrate toward BLA (Kb ~ 106 M-1). However, the results of thioflavin T (ThT) assays showed that myricetin is a stronger inhibitor against BLA fibrillation compared to morin hydrate.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Therefore, novel liposomes of oleic acid coated with camel α-lactalbumin (α-LA coated liposomes) were developed for their potential antitumor activity against CRC, both in vitro and in DMH-induced CRC-modeled animal. In vitro results indicated the high safety of α-LA coated liposomes towards normal human cells with potent antitumor activity against Caco-2 cells at an IC50 value of 57.01 ± 3.55 µM with selectivity index of 6.92 ± 0.48. This antitumor activity has been attributed to induction of the apoptotic mechanism, as demonstrated by nuclear condensation and arrest of Caco-2 cells in sub-G1 populations. α-LA coated liposomes also revealed a significant up-regulation of the p53 gene combined with a down-regulation of the Bcl2 gene. Moreover, in vivo results revealed that treatment of induced-CRC modeled animals with α-LA coated liposomes for six weeks markedly improved the CRC-disorders; this was achieved from the significant reduction in the values of AFP, CEA, CA19.9, TNF-α, IL-1β, MDA, and NO coupled with remarkable rise in SOD, GPx, GSH, CAT, and CD4+ levels. The histopathological findings asserted the therapeutic potential of α-LA coated liposomes in the treatment of CRC. Therefore, the present results proved the antitumor activity of α-LA coated liposomes against CRC through the restoration of impaired oxidative stress, improved immune response, and reduced inflammation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Nowadays, there is no exclusive treatment for this condition, and considering that preventive measures usually fail, new therapeutic approaches need to be proposed and investigated. This present pilot study compared the effects of diet alone and in association with a combination of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in their 40:1 ratio, α-lactalbumin, and Gymnema sylvestre on different metabolic parameters in obese dysmetabolic patients. To this purpose, 37 patients with BMI between 30 and 40 and fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL were divided into two groups: (i) the control group followed a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet, (ii) while the study group was also supplemented with a daily dosage of two sachets, each one containing 1950 mg myo-inositol, 50 mg d-chiro-inositol, 50 mg α-lactalbumin, and 250 mg Gymnema Sylvestre. After a 6-month treatment, all parameters improved in both groups. Nevertheless, the treated group experienced a greater improvement, especially concerning the variation from the baseline of HOMA index, triglycerides, BMI, body weight, and waist circumference. These findings support the supplementation with myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in the 40:1 ratio, α-lactalbumin, and Gymnema sylvestre as a therapeutical strategy to potentiate the beneficial effects induced via dietary programs in dysmetabolic patients.",

      "abstract": "Whey from goat and sheep have been gaining attention in the last few years for their nutritional properties. Unfortunately, β-Lg, not found in human milk, may trigger infant allergies if used in infant food formulations, so there is a growing interest in developing ingredients derived from whey with higher α-La/β-Lg ratios. The objective of this work was to study the effect of high-pressure processing (HPP) on caprine and ovine native whey concentrates (NWC) in order to obtain α-Lactalbumin (α-La)-enriched fractions. NWCs were treated at 600 MPa (23 °C) for 2, 4, and 15 min and two pH conditions were studied (physiological pH and pH 4.60). The concentration of β-Lg in supernatant fraction after HPP significantly decreased after 2 min of treatment, while the concentration of α-La was unchanged in both goat and sheep samples. Longer HPP processing times (up to 15 min) progressively increased α-La purification degree but also decreased the α-La yield. Caprine and ovine NWCs treated at physiological pH provided better α-La yield, α-La purification degree, and higher β-Lg precipitation degrees than the corresponding acidified samples, while the corresponding NWC supernatant (NWCsup) showed lower values for both surface hydrophobicity and total free thiol indices, suggesting a higher extent of protein aggregation. Effects of sample acidification and the HPP treatment were opposite to those previously reported on bovine NWC, so further characterization of caprine and ovine β-Lg should be carried out to understand their different behavior."

      "abstract": "Despite the beneficial effect of myo-inositol on metabolic, hormonal, and reproductive parameters of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients, 28% to 38% could be resistant to this treatment. The combination with the milk protein α-lactalbumin can be a useful therapeutic approach to overcome inositol resistance and achieve ovulation in these women. This open-label prospective study aimed to compare the effects of supplementing myo-inositol plus α-lactalbumin vs myo-inositol alone on reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in PCOS. A total of 50 anovulatory women with a PCOS diagnosis were randomly assigned to receive myo-inositol alone or a combination of myo-inositol and α-lactalbumin for three months. Anthropometric measures, hormonal levels, and menstrual cycle duration were collected at baseline and after treatment. The therapy with myo-inositol plus α-lactalbumin improved both ovulation rate and menstrual cycle duration more than myo-inositol alone. The body weight was significantly reduced in women receiving myo-inositol plus α-lactalbumin, while patients in the myo-inositol group experienced no change. In addition, the improvement of hyperandrogenism was more prominent in patients treated with myo-inositol plus α-lactalbumin. The benefits of associating myo-inositol and α-lactalbumin clearly make this combination a true edge in the management of PCOS."

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Dietary intervention has emerged as a promising strategy for the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study is to investigate the ameliorative effects of the α-lactalbumin peptide Asp-Gln-Trp (DQW) against NAFLD and the underlying mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS: The models of lipid metabolism disorders are established both in HepG2 cells and in C57BL/6J mice. The results demonstrate that DQW activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and subsequently ameliorates lipid deposition and oxidative stress in vitro. Interestingly, GW6471 markedly attenuates the modulatory effects of DQW on the PPARα pathway in HepG2 cells. Moreover, results of in vivo experiments indicate that DQW alleviates body weight gain, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and oxidative stress in high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. At the molecular level, DQW activates PPARα, subsequently enhances fatty acid β-oxidation, and reduces lipogenesis, thereby ameliorating hepatic steatosis. Meanwhile, DQW may ameliorate liver injury and oxidative stress via activating the PPARα/nuclear-factor erythroid 2 (Nrf2)/heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway. CONCLUSION: Those results indicate that α-lactalbumin peptide DQW may be an effective dietary supplement for alleviating NAFLD by alleviating lipid deposition and oxidative stress.",

Few studies report on milk protein hydrolysates' XO inhibitory activity, with the mechanism of their interaction remaining elusive. Here, different commercial enzymes were used to hydrolyze α-lactalbumin and bovine colostrum casein. The two proteins hydrolyzed by alkaline protease exhibited the most potent XO inhibitory activity (bovine casein: IC50 = 0.13 mg mL-1; α-lactalbumin: IC50 = 0.28 mg mL-1). Eight potential XO inhibitory peptides including VYPFPGPI, GPVRGPFPIIV, VYPFPGPIPN, VYPFPGPIHN, QLKRFSFRSFIWR, LVYPFPGPIHN, AVFPSIVGR, and GFININSLR (IC50 of 4.67-8.02 mM) were purified and identified from alkaline protease hydrolysates by using gel filtration, LC-MS/MS and PeptideRanker. The most important role of inhibiting activity of peptides is linked to hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding based on the results of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The enzymatic hydrolysate of α-lactalbumin and bovine colostrum casein could be a competitive candidates for hyperuricemia-resisting functional food.",

Eighteen semi-professional female rugby union players (age 23.8 ± 5.2 y; mean ± SD) wore wrist actigraphy watches for four seven-day blocks corresponding to the pre-season, a home game, a bye week (i.e. no competition game scheduled) and an away game. Participants consumed either an α-lactalbumin (α-LAC), or placebo drink (PLA) every night two hours before bed for the duration of the season. Generalised linear mixed models were used to investigate the effects of the nutritional intervention on sleep variables (total sleep time, sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset) over the duration of the season. There was a significant condition by period interaction effect on SOL (p = 0.01). While similar at baseline (23.3 ± 16.3 and 23.2 ± 18.9 min α-LAC and placebo respectively) and for the home game (22.4 ± 17.6 and 19.3 ± 14.9 min α-LAC and placebo respectively), SOL was reduced in the α-LAC group for the bye (11.6 ± 13.4 min) and away game (17.0 ± 11.5 min; p = 0.045). In comparison, SOL remained unchanged in the PLA group (bye 21.2 ± 17.3 and away 22.5 ± 18.5 min). Pre-sleep α-lactalbumin consumption improved SOL in a semi-professional female team-sport cohort. Thus, α-lactalbumin could be utilised by athletes to support sleep during a competitive season."

      "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is an exopeptidase mainly present in epithelial tissues of the liver, kidney, and intestine. It is involved in the cleavage of a variety of substrates including the incretin hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 binds to the GLP-1 receptors of pancreatic β-cells and leads to β-cell proliferation and increases insulin secretion through associated gene expression. In diabetes, a constant increase in the glucose level leads to glucotoxicity, which destroys pancreatic β-cells, decreases the insulin level, and further increases the blood glucose level. Inhibition of DPP-IV is one of the strategies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In recent years, peptides derived from a variety of dietary proteins have been reported to exhibit inhibitory activity against the DPP-IV enzyme. Such peptides should also be protected from the action of digestive enzymes to keep their bioactivity intact. Therefore, the present investigation was aimed to evaluate the in vitro DPP-IV inhibition potential and in vivo antidiabetic potential of α-lactalbumin in non-encapsulated hydrolysate (NEH), freeze-dried encapsulated hydrolysate (FDEH), and emulsified encapsulated hydrolysate (EEH) forms. Percent DPP-IV inhibition by the NEH, FDEH, and EEH after simulated gastrointestinal digestion was 36 ± 2.28, 54 ± 2.02, and 64 ± 2.02, respectively. The oral administration of the NEH, FDEH, and EEH at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight was evaluated in nicotinamide-streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic experimental rats in a study of 30 days. Rats in the diabetic control group showed an increase in the blood glucose level and liver function enzymes and a decrease in GLP-1, insulin, and antioxidative enzymes. Administration of hydrolysates reversed the parameters by lowering the blood glucose level and increasing GLP-1 and insulin levels in plasma. The blood lipid profile, liver enzyme (ALT, AST, and AP) levels, and catalase and superoxide dismutase activity were also found to be normalized and better managed in experimental diabetic rats.",

Firstly, the binding of Mog and all physical-treated ALa was a static quenching process. Mog had the greatest binding affinity for HU-ALa among all treated samples. U or H treatment could change surface hydrophobicity of ALa/Mog complex. Secondly, at the molar ratio (ALa:Mog) of 1:50, foaming ability (FA) of all ALa samples got the maximum. The sequence of FA in ALa and ALa/Mog complex was listed as follow: HU > U > H > UH. Moreover, foaming stability (FS) of HU-ALa was the highest, followed by H-ALa, U-ALa and UH-ALa. Meanwhile, low concentration Mog increased FS of ALa or UH-ALa, but it reduced FS of H-ALa, U-ALa and HU-ALa. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) experiment indicated that ALa/Mog complex after U or H treatment was quickly absorbed at air/water interface, compared with the treated ALa, and HU-ALa/Mog had the largest frequency shift. In addition, HU-ALa had the thickest bubble membrane and the highest dissipation shift in all samples, indicating that the absorbed membrane thickness and viscoelasticity of samples was correlated with foam stability. Therefore, U and H treatment synergism with Mog was an effective approach to enhance foam properties of ALa, which indicated that HU-treated ALa/Mog complex could be viewed as the safe and efficient foaming agent applied in food processing.",

      "abstract": "Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are rising as a new strategy for cancer therapy. However, traditional laboratory screening to find and identify novel ACPs from hundreds to thousands of peptides is costly and time consuming. Here, a sequential procedure is applied to identify candidate ACPs from a computer-generated peptide library inspired by alpha-lactalbumin, a milk protein with known anticancer properties. A total of 2688 distinct peptides, 5-25 amino acids in length, are generated from alpha-lactalbumin. In silico ACP screening using the physicochemical and structural filters and three machine learning models lead to the top candidate peptides ALA-A1 and ALA-A2. In vitro screening against five human cancer cell lines supports ALA-A2 as the positive hit. ALA-A2 selectively kills A549 lung cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, with no hemolytic side effects, and acts as a cell penetrating peptide without membranolytic effects. Sequential window acquisition of all theorical fragment ions-proteomics and functional validation reveal that ALA-A2 induces autophagy to mediate lung cancer cell death. This approach to identify ALA-A2 is time and cost-effective. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the exact intracellular targets of ALA-A2. Moreover, these findings support the use of larger computational peptide libraries built upon multiple proteins to further advance ACP research and development."

Applying alpha-lactalbumin (α-lac)-enriched whey or casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP)-reduced whey to infant formula may enable further reduction of formula protein by improving the amino acid profile. Growth, nutrient intake, and protein metabolites were evaluated in a randomized, prospective, double-blinded intervention trial where term infants received standard formula (SF:2.2 g protein/100 kcal; n = 83) or low-protein formulas with α-lac-enriched whey (α-lac-EW;1.75 g protein/100 kcal; n = 82) or CGMP-reduced whey (CGMP-RW;1.76 g protein/100 kcal; n = 80) from 2 to 6 months. Breast-fed infants (BF; n = 83) served as reference. Except between 4 and 6 months, when weight gain did not differ between α-lac-EW and BF (p = 0.16), weight gain was higher in all formula groups compared to BF. Blood urea nitrogen did not differ between low-protein formula groups and BF during intervention, but was lower than in SF. Essential amino acids were similar or higher in α-lac-EW and CGMP-RW compared to BF. Conclusion: Low-protein formulas enriched with α-lac-enriched or CGMP-reduced whey supports adequate growth, with more similar weight gain in α-lac-enriched formula group and BF, and with metabolic profiles closer to that of BF infants.",

In this study, high-pressure processing (HPP) was assessed as a β-Lg removal strategy to generate an enriched α-Lactalbumin (α-La) fraction from bovine native whey concentrate. Different HPP treatment parameters were considered: initial pH (physiological and acidified), sample temperature (7-35 °C), pressure (0-600 MPa) and processing time (0-490 s). The conditions providing the best α-La yield and α-La purification degree balance (46.16% and 80.21%, respectively) were 4 min (600 MPa, 23 °C), despite the significant decrease of the surface hydrophobicity and the total thiol content indexes in the α-La-enriched fraction. Under our working conditions, the general effects of HPP on α-La and β-Lg agreed with results reported in other studies of cow milk or whey. Notwithstanding, our results also indicated that the use of native whey concentrate could improve the β-Lg precipitation degree and the α-La purification degree, in comparison to raw milk or whey. Future studies should include further characterization of the α-La-enriched fraction and the implementation of membrane concentration and HPP treatment to valorize cheese whey."

Moreover, the effects of microwave or water-bath heating on the protein-polyphenol interaction mechanism have been not clarified. The pasteurization condition (65 °C, 30 min) was selected to compare the effects of microwave or water bath on binding behavior, structure, and cell proliferation between α-lactalbumin (α-LA) and safflower yellow (SY), thus providing a guide for the selection of functional dairy processing conditions. RESULTS: Microwave heat treatment of α-LA-SY resulted in stronger fluorescence quenching than that of conventional heat treatment. Moreover, the binding constant Ka of all α-LA-SY samples was augmented significantly after microwave or water bath treatment, and microwave-heated α-LA-SY showed the maximum Ka . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that microwave heating resulted in more ordered structures of α-LA into its disordered structures than water bath heating. However, the ferric reducing antioxidant power and chroma value of α-LA-SY were more reduced by microwave heating than by water bath heating. Moreover, microwave heating facilitated the cell proliferation of α-LA-SY compared with water bath treatment. CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated that microwave heating promoted interaction between α-LA and SY more than water bath heating did. Microwave heat treatment was a safe and effective way to enhance the binding affinity of α-LA to SY, being a potential application in food industry. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: The gastrointestinal hydrolysate of α-lactalbumin, the hydrolysate fraction with molecular weight (MW) < 3 kDa (LH-3k), and the fragments with smallest MW among LH-3K harvested through dextran gel chromatography (F5) are used. Hyperuricemia mice are induced via daily oral gavage of potassium oxonate and hypoxanthine. F5 displays the highest in vitro xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibition among all the fractions separated from LH-3k. Oral administration of F5 significantly reduces the levels of serum uric acid (UA), creatinine, and urea nitrogen. F5 treatment could ameliorate kidney injury through alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation. F5 alleviates hyperuricemia in mice by inhibiting hepatic XO activity and regulating the expression of renal urate transporters. Gut microbiota analysis illustrates that F5 administration increases the abundance of some SCFAs producers, and inhibits the growth of hyperuricemia and inflammation associated genera. LH-3k exhibits similar effects but does not show significance as those of the F5 fraction. CONCLUSION: The anti-hyperuricemia and nephroprotective functions of F5 are mediated by inhibiting hepatic XO activity, ameliorating oxidative stress and inflammation, regulating renal urate transporters, and modulating the gut microbiota in hyperuricemic mice.",

      "abstract": "The progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related to insulin resistance and gut microbiota. Dietary interventions have emerged as effective palliative strategies for NAFLD. The present study investigated the potential mechanisms by which α-lactalbumin peptide Asp-Gln-Trp (DQW) ameliorated insulin resistance and gut microbiota dysbiosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. The results demonstrated that DQW treatment alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. DQW treatment also increased the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes in the gut, reduced the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria (such as Bacteroides, Blautia, and Alistipes) and enhanced the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (such as Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group). DQW treatment promoted the production of SCFAs and subsequently improved intestinal barrier integrity and inflammation. Furthermore, the results of real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting further proved that the effects of DQW on the attenuation of hepatic insulin resistance were mediated by the PPARα and IRS1/PI3K/AKT pathways. Taken together, these results indicated that DQW treatment could attenuate HFD-induced NAFLD and insulin resistance by modulating gut microbiota composition, enhancing the SCFA levels, and activating the PPARα and IRS1/PI3K/Akt pathways.",

The methods of circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence quenching, dynamic light scattering, and molecular simulation were used to characterize the effects of processing-induced changes in protein structure, size distribution, binding site conformation, and residue charges on their binding characteristics between them. The results indicated that the thermal treatments significantly increased the quenching constants of the complex at pH 7.4/8.0 and 60/80 °C, as well as the accessible fraction of protein at pH 8.0/80 °C. Both HPP and thermal treatments increased the random coil content and showed limited effects on the α-helix and β-sheet contents of α-La and caused the aggregation of the complex to varying degrees. Molecular dynamic simulation and docking analyses revealed that the binding site of the complex did not change under different processing conditions, but the solvent-accessible surface area varied under different conditions.",

The critical aggregation concentration (CAC) of GA in the presence of α-La was 0.6 mM at pH 7.0, while it was 1.0 mM at pH 2.5. Also, in the presence of a GA concentration of 0-15.00 mM, more GA molecules combined onto the α-La surface at pH 2.5 than at pH 7.0, as evident from the binding isotherms. The turbidity and particle size of α-La/GA were greater in acidic solution than those under neutral conditions. This result could be interpreted by the formation of aggregates under higher GA concentration at pH 2.5. Meanwhile, the viscosity of the complex was higher at pH 2.5 than at pH 7.0 in the presence of 3.00-15.00 mM GA, as analyzed from the rheological properties. The foaming ability (FA) of α-La was significantly enhanced in the presence of 10.00 mM GA. Simultaneously, acidic solution could generate a more stable foaming system with a thicker film layer stabilized by the complex compared with neutral solution. These findings could be beneficial for developing a kind of acidic food-grade foaming agent.",

It is of interest to examine and compare the difference in backbone cleavage characteristics, by using reductive and hydrolytic reagents. METHODS: In-source decay (ISD) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS), reductive treatment of αLA and HEL with dithiothreitol (DTT) and acid hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were employed to examine the difference in the backbone cleavage characteristics of αLA and HEL. RESULTS: The treatment of αLA and HEL with DTT/AcOHNH3 resulted in similar cleavage behaviors of the backbone N-Cα and S-S bonds, i.e., the enhancements of the intensity and m/z range of sequence-reflected fragment ions were very similar. However, the treatment of αLA with DTT/TFA resulted in unexpected residue-specific degradation at the peptide bond of the Asp-Xxx, Xxx-Ser/Thr, Gln-Xxx, Xxx-Gly and Gly-Xxx residues, while HEL did not occur such degradation. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained above indicate that acidic αLA is very sensitive to acidic additive such as TFA, while basic HEL is resistance to acidic additives. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The study demonstrates the sensitive and resistant of evolutionary homologous proteins αLA and HEL to the acid hydrolysis and these characters come from acidic and basic nature of the proteins."

      "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of hematopoietic stem cells. Although there have been advancements in treatment, there is still a need to develop a biotherapeutic agent. A new variant of the human alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (HALOA) complex has been synthesized, which showed similarities with SNARE. The native α-LA was treated with EDTA to remove Ca2+ ions confirmed by ICP-OES and Arsenazo III to unfold and attain apo structure. The apo LA was mixed with OA in a specific ratio, leading to HALOA complex formation. The conformational state from native to complex was elucidated by circular dichroism (far; 190-260 nm and near; 260-340 nm UV-CD), which confirmed that the complex consists of a majority of turns and β-sheet structure. SDS-PAGE result showed the masking effect of OA on apo α-LA. In the lane of the complex, there was no band detected. However, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) dye has shown maximum fluorescence intensity with the complex because of the availability of hydrophobic patches, which was further validated by NMR spectroscopy indicating the masking effect of OA on the apo α-LA. The SNARE behavior of the complex (500 nm) has been confirmed by TEM. This new structural variant complex shows anti-tumor activity on chronic myeloid leukemia by targeting the IL-8, survivin, and induces apoptosis through DNA fragmentation, but not against normal cells. Overall, the formulated complex shows that SNARE-like behavior can be used as a promising anti-tumor agent with lower toxicity and maximum bioavailability.",

However, investigation on the anaphylaxis changes of ultrasound-treated α-lactalbumin (ALA) during digestion is lacking. The anaphylaxis of ultrasound-treated ALA and its digesta was investigated. The anti-digestive stable peptides were identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Ultrasound induced the tertiary structure of ALA to unfold and increased its anaphylaxis. During digestion, the anaphylaxis of both gastric and gastroduodenal digesta was further increased. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. On the one hand, linear epitopes played an important role in affecting anaphylaxis compared with the conformational epitope, and some linear epitopes were still retained on the anti-digestive stable peptides produced after gastroduodenal digestion, resulting in increased anaphylaxis after digestion. On the other hand, the presence of intact ALA molecules after digestion still remained strong anaphylaxis. Compared with the digesta of untreated ALA, the digesta of ultrasound-treated ALA possessed higher anaphylaxis. The results indicated that ultrasound increased the anaphylaxis of ALA during digestion."

Our previous studies found that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum HM-22 (L. plantarum HM-22) showed a good gastrointestinal survival rate and intestinal colonization. To investigate the effect of L. plantarum HM-22 on intestinal inflammation and intestinal microbiota in α-LA-induced allergic mice, in this study, L. plantarum HM-22 at low and high doses was intragastrically administered to α-LA-induced allergic mice for 5 weeks. The results showed that L. plantarum HM-22 significantly relieved the weight loss and organ index of α-LA-induced allergic mice (p < 0.05). L. plantarum HM-22 increased the levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the serum of α-LA-induced allergic mice and decreased the levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and the proinflammatory factor interleukin-4 (IL-4) (p < 0.05). The crypt structure of the colon tissues of α-LA-induced allergic mice changed, goblet cells decreased, and the phenomenon of a large number of inflammatory corpuscles that appeared was improved and alleviated with the intervention of L. plantarum HM-22 by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Western blot analysis showed that L. plantarum HM-22 significantly increased the expression of occludin and claudin-1 in the colon of α-LA-induced allergic mice and decreased the expression of the inflammatory proteins p65 and IκBα (p < 0.05). The intestinal microbiota of mice in each group was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and the results showed that intervention with L. plantarum HM-22 improved the intestinal microbes of α-LA-induced allergic mice. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed the correlation between intestinal microbiota changes and the α-LA-induced allergy-related index. This study provides a theoretical basis for probiotics to prevent allergies by changing the intestinal microbiota.",

By choosing appropriate environmental conditions the thermal precipitation of either α-la or β-lg can be induced. Whereas β-lg irreversibly aggregates, the precipitated α-la can be resolubilized by a subsequent adjustment of the solution's pH and the ionic composition. This study reports on the analytical characterization of resolubilized α-la compared to its native counterpart as a reference in order to assess whether the resolubilized α-la can be considered close to 'native'. Turbidity and quantification by RP-HPLC of the resolubilized α-la solutions were used as a measure of solubility in aqueous environment. RP-HPLC was also applied to determine the elution time as a measure for protein's hydrophobicity. DSC measurement was performed to determine the denaturation peak temperature of resolubilized α-la. FTIR spectroscopy provided insights in the secondary structure. The refolding of α-la achieved best results using pH 8.0 and a 3-fold stoichiometric amount of Ca2+ per α-la molecule. The results showed that the mechanism of aggregation induced by gentle thermal treatment under acidic conditions with subsequent mechanical separation is reversible to a certain extent, however, the exact native conformation was not restored."

      "abstract": "Whey is an abundantand sustainable source of bioactive peptides obtained from cheese making process. Whey proteins such as α-lactalbumin can be biologically active when the bioactive peptides encrypted in the amino acid sequence of the native protein are released by enzymatic hydrolysis. In the present work, the identification, sequence analysis, and antioxidant activity of bioaccessible peptides from α-lactalbumin alcalase-hydrolysate was assessed. Antioxidant activity (ABTS, ORAC, and HORAC) of α-lactalbumin showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) after the enzymatic treatment with alcalase and this capacity increased even more after the simulation of the gastrointestinal digestion process. Peptides contained in the gastrointestinal digest of α-lactalbumin hydrolysate were separated by preparative RP-HPLC (55 fractions), and three peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis from selected fractions: IWCKDDQNPH (MW: 1254.54 Da) f(59-68), KFLDDDLTDDIM (MW: 1439.64 Da) f(79-90), DKFLDDDLTDDIM (MW: 1554.67 Da) f(78-90). Among the chemically synthesized peptides, IWCKDDQNPH showed the highest antioxidant capacity determined by ORAC, ABTS, and HORAC assays (IC50 0.015 ± 0.002, 0.45 ± 0.02, and 1.30 ± 0.05 mg/ml, respectively) and this activity may be related to the amino acid sequence. This is the first report where these bioaccessible peptides from α-lactalbumin hydrolysate were identified. The α-lactalbumin hydrolysate could be employed as a functional antioxidant ingredient. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The present work studied the bioaccessibility of antioxidant peptides from an α-lactalbumin alcalase-hydrolysate by identifying three novel bioaccessible peptides responsible for the antioxidant capacity, providing evidence of the hydrolysate potential as an antioxidant ingredient in the formulations of functional foods and/or food supplements.",

However, long term exposure to UV-B illumination may induce undesired oxidative modifications of amino acid residues in the protein. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of UV-induced aggregation of apo-α-LA (a calcium-depleted form of α-LA) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and by addition of tryptophan (Trp) as a photosensitizer. The addition of Trp to apo-α-LA illuminated under anaerobic conditions facilitated the highest level of free thiol release and disulfide-mediated aggregation as compared to without addition of Trp under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Addition of Trp under aerobic condition resulted in the lowest level of free thiols and disulfide-mediated aggregation and the aerobic conditions caused oxidation of the free Trp with formation of kynurenine and 5-hydroxy-Trp. Minor levels of the Trp oxidation product, 3-hydroxy-kynurenine (2% converted from Trp), was formed in apo-α-LA with added Trp under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions after UV-B treatment."

      "abstract": "To clarify the mechanism of semicarbazide-modified α-lactalbumin (SEM-LA)-mediated cytotoxicity, we investigated its effect on human U937 leukemia cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells in the current study. SEM-LA induced apoptosis in U937 cells, which showed increased NOX4 expression, procaspase-8 degradation, and t-Bid production. FADD depletion inhibited SEM-LA-elicited caspase-8 activation, t-Bid production, and cell death, indicating that SEM-LA activated death receptor-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells. SEM-LA stimulated Ca2+-mediated Akt activation, which in turn increased Sp1- and p300-mediated NOX4 transcription. The upregulation of NOX4 expression promoted ROS-mediated p38 MAPK phosphorylation, leading to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-regulated tristetraprolin (TTP) degradation. Remarkably, TTP downregulation increased the stability of TNF-α mRNA, resulting in the upregulation of TNF-α protein expression. Abolishment of Ca2+-NOX4-ROS axis-mediated p38 MAPK activation attenuated SEM-LA-induced TNF-α upregulation and protected U937 cells from SEM-LA-mediated cytotoxicity. The restoration of TTP expression alleviated the effect of TNF-α upregulation and cell death induced by SEM-LA. Altogether, the data in this study demonstrate that SEM-LA activates TNF-α-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells through the NOX4/p38 MAPK/PP2A axis. We think that a similar pathway can also explain the death of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells after SEM-LA treatment.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 34 normal weight or overweight patients (14 in Mexico and 20 in Italy), aged 18 to 40 years, with anovulation and infertility > 1 year and insulin resistance diagnosed by HOMA-Index. Patients were administered orally with 2 g myo-inositol, 50 mg alpha-lactalbumin, and 200 µg of folic acid twice a day for 6 months. Controls were the same patients at t0 (baseline). The primary outcome was HOMA-index decrease after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Other parameters monitored were BMI, progesterone, LH, FSH, total testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides. RESULTS: Recovery was general, and its relevance was higher when the starting point was further away from the normal range. The most important results were obtained with insulin, HOMA-index, LH, and androstenedione. No significant adverse effects were detected in both groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial demonstrated for the first time that myo-inositol and alpha-lactalbumin improve important parameters in PCOS patients characterized by different metabolic profiles.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by increased oxidative stress and decreased level of dopamine. At present, the therapeutic interventions of PD are associated with undesirable adverse effects. To overcome these side effects, a new candidate bioinspired molecule is needed for the management of PD. Camel α-lactalbumin (α-LA) is the most abundant protein in camel's milk and has a potential to act as a nutraceutical supplement for neurological functions. Oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid, has been widely associated with a reduced risk of PD. The present study aimed to formulate the camel α-LA and oleic acid (CLOA) complex under specific conditions and to evaluate its efficacy as a neuroprotective in rotenone induced PC12 cell model of PD. Our results demonstrated that removal of Ca++ ions from camel α-LA by EDTA enhances its binding efficiency with oleic acid, and the complex was characterized by UV-CD, ANS fluorescence spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, CLOA complex treatment reduced the oxidative stress and increased the cell viability by enhancing the level of dopamine and the expression of SIRT1, FOXO3a, HIF-1α, and HSF-1. We also validated the neuroprotective role of the complex by incubating the cells with CLOA complex prior to rotenone treatment. We inferred from the outcome of the results that the individual entity, i.e., α-LA or OA, is not as effective as the complex. Taken together, our study indicates that CLOA complex might be a potential candidate for the development of future therapeutic drugs for PD.",

Merr., Trigonella foenum-graceum L., and Moringa oleifera Lam. considered to induce galactagogue activity. This research aimed to evaluate the galactagogue activity of PHF and its effects on α-lactalbumin (LALBA) as well as aquaporin (AQP) gene expression at messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels in mammary glands of lactating rats. METHODS: Thirty lactating Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6), each has 7 pups. Group I was treated orally with distilled water as negative control. Groups II, III, and IV were orally administered with PHF at 26.25, 52.5 and 105 mg/kg/day, respectively. Group V was treated with domperidone 2.7 mg/kg/day, orally as positive control. The treatment was performed at third day until fifteenth day of parturition. The observed parameters include the galactagogue activity indicating by milk yield of lactating rats, the pup weight changes and lactating rats body weight changes during lactating period, mRNA expression of LALBA and AQP using quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and histopathological analysis of mammary glands at the end of treatment period. RESULT: The result showed that the PHF groups (52.5 and 105 mg/kg/day) and domperidone were significantly increased milk production of lactating rats (p < 0.05). The levels of mRNA expression of LALBA and AQPs were significantly upregulated by 105 mg/kg/day of PHF or 2.7 mg/kg of domperidone administration (p < 0.0001). Histopathological analysis of mammary glands shows that alveoli diameter was increase 14.59 and 19.33% at 105 mg/kg of PHF and 2.7 mg/kg of domperidone treatment, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study suggested that PHF has potentially to induce galactagogue activity on lactating period through upregulation of LALBA and AQP genes at the mRNA level.",

The emulsions prepared with laccase cross-linking US-α-lactalbumin (α-lactalbumin treated with US pre-treatment) and US-α-lactalbumin were scrutinized for oxidative and physical stability at room temperature for two weeks of storage. Laccase cross-linking US-α-lactalbumin (Lac-US-α-lactalbumin) revealed improved physical stability in comparison with US-α-lactalbumin, specified by droplet size, structural morphology, adsorbed protein, emulsifying properties and creaming index. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that there was formation of polymers in Lac-US-α-lactalbumin emulsion. Surface hydrophobicity of Lac-US-α-lactalbumin was higher than that of US-α-lactalbumin, and gradually enhanced with the increase of ultrasound time. More importantly, the measurements of peroxide values and conjugated dienes were used to study the oxidative stability of the CLA emulsions. The Lac-US-α-lactalbumin emulsion proved to be reducing the synthesis of fatty acid hydroperoxides and less conjugated dienes compared to the native and US-α-lactalbumin emulsions. This study revealed that the combination of US pre-treatment and laccase cross-linking might be an effective technique for the modification of CLA emulsions.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize in vitro D-chiro-inositol intestinal absorption and identify factors able to improve its bioavailability. D-chiro-inositol, one of the natural occurring stereoisomer of myo-inositol, acts as a second messenger in insulin-regulated glucose metabolism in complementary mode with myo-inositol. Because of their insulin-mimetic activities and safety, both myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol are often employed as supplements in insulin-resistance treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trans-epithelial passage of D-chiro-inositol was evaluated in the human intestinal Caco-2 cell line differentiated on filter, a widely established in vitro model to study intestinal absorption. D-chiro-inositol transport was assayed in a concentration range corresponding to an estimated in vivo concentration following oral supplementation. α-Lactalbumin peptides, obtained by in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion, were tested as possible modulators of the intestinal permeability of D-chiro-inositol. RESULTS: The absorption of this stereoisomer was relatively low and presumably due to passive diffusion, while it was greatly enhanced by the presence of α-Lactalbumin digest. α-Lactalbumin peptides induced an increase in paracellular permeability that was completely reversible, indicating lack of cytotoxicity. This effect involved temporary rearrangement of F-actin apical cytoskeleton and of the tight junction protein ZO-1. CONCLUSIONS: Although further studies are required to identify and characterize the most effective peptides, the ability of α-Lactalbumin digest to act as absorption enhancers may have very interesting and promising applications in the fields of nutritional supplements and pharmacology.",

This study aims to determine the effects of C18 UFAs on the structures of BLA and BLG and their allergic properties, such as antigenicity and allergenicity. We reveal that C18 UFAs can efficiently promote the gradual unfolding of the structures of BLA and BLG and increase their hydrophobicity. Moreover, the IgG binding ability and the expression of IgG-dependent activation marker CD200R3 on basophils were remarkably promoted after C18 UFA treatment. Finally, we also observed that C18 UFAs can enhance the IgE binding ability and the degranulation capacity of human basophil KU812 cells (intracellular Ca2+, histamine, β-Hex, and IL-6). Collectively, these results suggested that C18 UFAs changed the structures of BLA and BLG, which contributed to their increased allergic potential.",

And, the antitumor activity, IgE/IgG-binding ability, and structural modifications were investigated. After α-La/β-Lg were treated by ultrasonic prior to binding with OA, the treated α-La/β-Lg showed high antitumor activity and IgE/IgG-binding ability, and significantly affected the structural modifications, which reflected by the reduction in α-helix content, the increase of molecular weight, intrinsic fluorescence intensity, and surface hydrophobicity. Molecular docking studies indicated that OA bound to α-La/β-Lg by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction. Therefore, ultrasonic prior to binding with OA could improve antitumor activity and IgE/IgG-binding ability of α-La/β-Lg as a result of structural modifications. And, ultrasonic prior to binding with fatty acid processing of milk products alone may increase the antitumor activity, this change may enhance the risk of an allergenic reaction in milk allergy patients to some extent. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Fatty acids, natural ligands associated with the bovine milk proteins, and milk protein-fatty acid complex has a variety of functional applications in the food industry. This study revealed that antitumor activity, IgE/IgG-binding ability, and structural modifications of α-La/β-Lg induced by ultrasonic prior to binding with oleic acid. It will be beneficial to understand the mechanism of the functional changes of protein. Ultrasonic prior to binding with oleic acid will be more likely to develop a practical technology to improve the functional characteristics of milk protein and design the optimal nutritional performance of milk food.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) formulations for oromucosal administration induce a delayed rise in nicotine blood levels as opposed to the immediate nicotine increase obtained from cigarette smoking, this being a shortcoming of the therapy. Here, we demonstrate that α-lactalbumin/polyethylene oxide (ALA/PEO) electrospun nanofibers constitute an efficient oromucosal delivery system for fast-onset nicotine delivery of high relevance for acute dosing NRT applications. In vitro, nicotine-loaded nanofibers showed fast disintegration in water, with a weight loss up to 40% within minutes, and a faster nicotine release (26.1 ± 4.6% after 1 min of incubation) of the loaded nicotine compared to two relevant marketed NRT formulations with a comparable nicotine dose (i.e., 7.9 ± 5.1 and 2.2 ± 0.3% nicotine was released from a lozenge and a sublingual tablet, respectively). Model-fitting of the release data indicated that the release mechanism of nicotine from the hydrophilic nanofibers was possibly governed by more than one type of release phenomena. Remarkably, ex vivo studies using porcine buccal mucosa demonstrated a more efficient permeation of the nicotine released from the nanofibers [flux of 1.06 ± 0.22 nmol/(cm2·min)] compared to when dosing even a ten-fold concentrated nicotine solution [flux of 0.17 ± 0.14 nmol/(cm2·min)]. Moreover, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MS) imaging of ex vivo porcine buccal mucosa exposed to nicotine-loaded nanofibers clearly revealed higher amounts of nicotine throughout the epithelium, as well as in the lamina propria and submucosa of the tissue. Our findings suggest that nicotine-loaded ALA/PEO nanofibers have potential as a mucosal, fast-releasing, and biocompatible delivery system for nicotine, which can overcome the limitations of the currently marketed NRTs.",

An aggregation onset temperature was determined at approx. 80 °C for both systems (5:2 and 1:1 mixing ratio) with a protein concentration of 70% at a shear rate of 0.06 s-1. Increasing the shear rate up to 50 s-1 led to a decrease in the aggregation onset temperature independent of the mixing ratio. By decreasing the protein concentration to 60% in unsheared systems, the aggregation onset temperature decreased compared to that at a protein concentration of 70%. Furthermore, two significantly different onset temperatures were determined when the shear rate was increased to 25 s-1 and 50 s-1, which might result from a shear-induced phase separation. Application of combined thermal and mechanical treatment resulted in overall higher degrees of denaturation independent of the mixing ratio and protein concentration. At the conditions applied, the aggregation of the βLG and αLA mixtures was mainly due to the formation of non-covalent bonds. Although the proportion of disulfide bond aggregation increased with treatment temperature and shear rate, it was higher at a mixing ratio of 5:2 compared to that at 1:1."

To understand the consequences of such a crowded environment, pH-induced unfolding of holo alpha-lactalbumin (holo α-LA) was studied in the presence of ethylene glycol (EG). The effect of EG on the folding and stability of holo α-LA in aqueous solution was investigated using several spectroscopic techniques. The results indicate that stabilization/destabilization of holo α-LA by EG is concentration- and pH-dependent. Low concentration of EG stabilizes the protein at pH near its pI. From the results of far-UV CD, UV-visible and ANS fluorescence, intermediate state (MG state) was characterized in the presence of high concentration of ethylene glycol. The results invoke a new mechanism for the formation of MG state identical to active component of BAMLET. MG state of holo α-LA has a direct implication to cancer therapy. MG state of α-LA in complex with specific type of lipid is a novel class of protein-based anti-cancer complexes that incorporate oleic acid and deliver it to the cancer cells.",

Here we have investigated the in-vitro efficacy of the BAMLET complex in killing oral cancer (OC) cells, determined the active component of the complex and investigated possible biological mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two OC cell lines (±p53 mutation) and one dysplastic cell line were used as a model of progressive oral carcinogenesis. We performed cell viability assays with increasing BAMLET concentrations to determine the cytotoxic potential of the complex. We further analysed the individual components to determine their respective cytotoxicities. siRNA knockdown of p53 was used to determine its functional role in mediating sensitivity to BAMLET. Cell death mechanisms were investigated by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and the lactate dehydrogenase assay. RESULTS: Our results show that BAMLET is cytotoxic to the OC and dysplastic cell lines in a time and dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxic component was found to be oleic acid, which, can induce cytotoxicity even when not in complex. Our results indicate that the mechanism of cytotoxicity occurs through multiple simultaneous events including cell cycle arrest, autophagy like processes with a minor involvement of necrosis. CONCLUSION: Deciphering the mechanism of cytotoxicity will aid treatment modalities for OC. This study highlights the potential of BAMLET as a novel therapeutic strategy in oral dysplastic and cancerous cells.",

Here, we report the synthesis, characterization and theranostic applications of fluorescent ultrasmall gold quantum clusters that are stabilized by the milk metalloprotein alpha-lactalbumin. We synthesized three types of these nanoprobes that together display fluorescence across the visible and near-infrared spectra when excited at a single wavelength through optical colour coding. In live tumour-bearing mice, the near-infrared nanoprobe generates contrast for fluorescence, X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and exhibits long circulation times, low accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system, sustained tumour retention, insignificant toxicity and renal clearance. An intravenously administrated near-infrared nanoprobe with a large Stokes shift facilitated the detection and image-guided resection of breast tumours in vivo using a smartphone with modified optics. Moreover, the partially unfolded structure of alpha-lactalbumin in the nanoprobe helps with the formation of an anti-cancer lipoprotein complex with oleic acid that triggers the inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, immunogenic cell death and the recruitment of infiltrating macrophages. The biodegradability and safety profile of the nanoprobes make them suitable for the systemic detection and localized treatment of cancer.",

Cheese whey is of particular interest because it contains valuable proteins such as α-lactalbumin (α-LA) and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG). However, selective fractionation of these 2 proteins into pure fractions is complex because of their similar molecular weights. In this study, we proposed an innovative protein separation strategy based on coupling high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) with acidification of whey at pH 4.6. We investigated the effect of single-cycle HHP (600 MPa) for 5, 10, and 15 min and multiple-cycle HHP (1-3 cycles of 5 min at 600 MPa) on α-LA and β-LG fractionation from cheese whey at initial pH (control, pH 6.66) and acidified to pH 4.6. All pressurization conditions with acidified whey induced a drastic aggregation of β-LG compared with control whey. The highest degrees of purification (75 and 98%, respectively) and yields (95 and 88%, respectively) of α-LA and β-LG were obtained with the application of single-cycle HHP treatment of acidified whey at pH 4.6 at 600 MPa for 5 min. Our results showed the strong potential of using HHP as an innovative tool for the fractionation of valuable proteins such as α-LA from cheese whey.",

METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind controlled trial with 80 healthy newborn infants who were assigned to receive either an isocaloric low- or high-protein content formula (1.89 versus 2.1 g/100 kcal). The low-protein content formula was enriched with α-lactalbumin. A breast-fed reference group of 40 infants was studied concurrently. Anthropometric measures were taken at inclusion, after 6 and 12 wk as well as after 6 and 12 mo of follow-up. Primary outcome was weight gain in g/d between study inclusion to 12 wk. Secondary outcomes included anthropometric measures expressed in Z-scores, mean formula consumption, and caloric intake as well as food tolerance. RESULTS: Fifty-two infants in the formula group (low protein: 26, high protein: 26) and 32 in the breast-fed reference group completed the 3-mo intervention period. There was no difference in weight gain among feeding groups at the end of the intervention period. Mean weight gain in g/d was 32 in the low-protein, 31 in the high-protein, and 33 in the breast-fed reference group. No significant difference was found between study groups in Z-scores for weight, length, head circumference, weight-for-length, or body mass index nor for fat percentage at end of intervention and after follow-up. CONCLUSION: α-lactalbumin-enriched formula with a protein content of 1.89 g protein/100 kcal is safe and supports adequate growth.",

      "abstract": "Mucus is a viscoelastic biological hydrogel that protects the epithelial surface from penetration by most nanoparticles, which limits the efficiency of oral drug delivery. Pursuing highly efficient, biocompatible, and biodegradable oral drug vehicles is of central importance to the development of promising nanomedicine. Here, we prepared five peptosomes (PSs) with various sizes, shapes, and rigidities based on self-assembly of amphiphilic α-lactalbumin (α-lac) peptides from partial enzymolysis and cross-linking. The mucus permeation of α-lac PSs and release of curcumin (Cur) encapsulated in these PSs were evaluated. Compared with a long nanotube, big nanosphere, small nanosphere, and cross-linked short nanotube, we demonstrated that a short nanotube (SNT) exhibits excellent permeability in mucus, which enables it to arrive at epithelial cells quickly. Besides, SNT exhibits the highest cellular uptake and transmembrane permeability on Caco-2/HT29-MTX (E12) 3D coculture model. In vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed that SNT formulation shows the highest curcumin bioavailability, which is 6.85-folds higher than free Cur. Most importantly, Cur loaded in SNT exhibits the optimum therapeutic efficacy for in vivo treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis. In the end, the mechanism of the high permeability of SNTs through mucus was explained by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, which indicated that short time scale jiggling and flying across pores of mucus network played key roles. These findings revealed the tubular α-lac PSs could be a promising oral drug delivery system targeted to mucosal for improving absorption and bioavailability of hydrophobic bioactive ingredients.",

      "abstract": "A nanotheranostic system was developed using α-lactalbumin along with Fe3O4 nanoparticles as an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent for medical imaging and doxorubicin as the therapeutic agent. α-lactalbumin was precipitated and cross-linked using poly(ethylene glycol) and glutaraldehyde. Besides, polyethylenimine was applied to increase the number of amine groups during cross-linking between α-lactalbumin and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Interestingly, 90% of the initial protein used for the coaggregation process was incorporated in the prepared 130 nm nanocomposites, which facilitated the 85% doxorubicin loading. Formation of pH-sensitive imine bonds between glutaraldehyde and amine groups on α-lactalbumin and polyethylenimine resulted in higher release of doxorubicin at acidic pHs and consequently development of a pH-sensitive nanocarrier. The designed nanocomposite was less immunogenic owing to stimulating the production of less amounts of C3a, C5a, platelet factor 4, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, platelet-derived β-thromboglobulin, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β compared to the free doxorubicin. Furthermore, 1000 μg/mL nanocomposite led to 0.2% hemolytic activity, much less than the 5% standard limit. The void nanocarrier induced no significant level of cytotoxicity in breast cancer and normal cells following 96 h incubation. The doxorubicin-loaded nanocomposite presented higher cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and doxorubicin uptake in cancer cells than free doxorubicin. Conversely, lower cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and doxorubicin uptake were observed in normal cells treated with the doxorubicin-loaded nanocarrier compared to free doxorubicin. In line with the results of in vitro experiments, in vivo studies on tumor-bearing mice showed more suppression of tumor growth by the doxorubicin-loaded nanocomposite compared to the free drug. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic study revealed slow release of doxorubicin from the nanocomposite. Besides, in vitro and in vivo MRI studies presented a higher r2/r1 ratio and comparable contrast to the commercially available DOTAREM, respectively. Our findings suggest that this new nanocomposite is a promising nanotheranostic system with promising potential for cancer therapy and diagnosis."

No significant difference on incorporation ratio value of glycated α-LA was observed with and without DHPM pretreatment. However, IgE/IgG binding capacities of α-LA were decreased after glycation and DHPM pretreatment promoted the reduction. The lowest IgE/IgG binding capacities of glycated α-LA were obtained by DHPM pretreatment at 110 MPa. Native α-LA was mainly glycated at K62, K94, K98, whereas glycation sites and degree of substitution per peptide (DSP) were added after DHPM treatment. Therefore, the reduced IgE/IgG binding capacities of α-LA was attributed to the characteristics of glycated sites, including the amount, location, and DSP values. Interestingly, K98 played the most important role in decreasing IgE/IgG binding capacities of α-LA. The study revealed that glycation combined with DHPM was a promising way to decrease the allergenicity of proteins.",

The nanoassembly, SNLYZ-BLA demonstrated dose-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated cytotoxicity in multiple cancer cells such as MCF-7, MDA-MB231, HeLa and MG 63. It also demonstrated high loading capacity of a phytochemical based anticancer agent, curcumin (248.8 mg/g) and target-based pH-responsive in vitro drug release with around 85.8% curcumin release observed under acidic condition. Moreover, curcumin loaded SNLYZ-BLA (SNLYZ-BLA-CUR) induced cell viability reduction in all cancer cells including mouse melanoma (B16F10) by more than 90% within 24 h. Further, SNLYZ-BLA and SNLYZ-BLA-CUR when conjugated with folic acid enhanced the cytotoxicity via folate receptor-based targeting. Both drug loading and release induced conformational change and folding reconstitution of the protein nano-assembly, respectively, which made the whole system an efficient therapeutic agent that works via a dual mode of action. We demonstrated that SNLYZ-BLA and SNLYZ-BLA-CUR were highly biocompatible in vitro.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We considered eligible all second-trimester singleton pregnancies in women affected by IDA. We excluded any other disease, twin pregnancies, any other pharmacologic/nutraceutical treatments (besides folic acid) before/during pregnancy. We randomized patients in two groups: one underwent treatment with 1 tablet of MDFP-AL/day, the other one with 1 tablet of FG/day, for 30 days. We evaluated hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, red blood cells (RBCs), serum iron, hematocrit (Hct), and side effects at baseline (T0), after 15 days (T1) and 30 days (T2). RESULTS: 50 women met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. We did not observe significant differences between the two groups for mean age, gestational age at the enrollment and parity. In MDFP-AL group, after 15 days (T1) Hb, ferritin, serum iron and Hct and were significantly improved respect to baseline (T0); after 30 days (T2), all the parameters, including RBCs, were significantly improved respect to baseline (T0). Similarly, in FG group the investigated parameters were improved both after 15 (T1) and 30 days (T2) respect to baseline (T0), although less in percentage terms respect to MDFP-AL group. The side effects rate was 24% in FG group, whereas MDFP-AL group did not show any significant side effect. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, MDFP-AL is more effective and safe than FG for the treatment of IDA in pregnant women.",

      "abstract": "The effect of free cysteine (in different concentrations) on the thermal aggregation of calcium-saturated (Ca-sat) and -depleted (Ca-dep) α-lactalbumin (α-LA) was investigated at 25, 50, and 70 °C. The temperatures chosen were below the denaturation temperature ( Td) of Ca-dep and Ca-sat α-LA (25 °C), above the Td of Ca-dep α-LA and below that of Ca-sat α-LA (50 °C), and above the Td of Ca-sat α-LA (70 °C). Size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering showed that no aggregation or only minor aggregation was obtained at the investigated temperatures for both Ca-dep and Ca-sat α-LA even at extended holding times. Aggregates of Ca-sat α-LA were larger than those developed for Ca-dep α-LA. The addition of cysteine, a low-molecular-mass free thiol, resulted in increased aggregation of both Ca-sat and Ca-dep α-LA. Comparisons of SDS-PAGE run under reducing and nonreducing conditions showed that the formed cross-links were primarily disulfide bonds, but Western blots also showed small contributions from dityrosine cross-link formation. The aggregation kinetics related to monomer loss during heat treatment were determined by RP-UPLC and showed that the addition of cysteine increased the rate of aggregation. The activation energies for Ca-dep α-LA with 0.35 and 0.7 mM cysteine were found to be 59 ± 1 and 46 ± 4 kJ/mol, respectively, which showed that less energy was needed for the enhanced thermal aggregation of α-LA when the cysteine concentration was increased. This study showed that it was possible to control the aggregation size of α-LA by manipulating the incubation temperature and the cysteine concentration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myo-inositol (MI), successfully used in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), was administered with α-LA to exploit its action of favouring the passage of other molecules through biological barriers, and also considering its anti-inflammatory effect. METHODS: PCOS patients, according to the Rotterdam ESHRE-ASRM criteria, with anovulation and infertility > 1 year, were included in this open and prospective study. The preliminary phase was aimed at determining a set of MI-resistant PCOS patients. This treatment involved 2 g MI, taken twice per day by oral route, for three months. The Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index and MI plasma levels were measured. In the main phase, previously selected MI-resistant patients received the same daily amount of MI plus 50 mg α-LA twice a day, for a further three months. Ovulation was assessed using ultrasound examination on days 12, 14 and 20 of the cycle. The HOMA index, lipid, hormone and MI plasma levels were detected at baseline and at the end of this phase. RESULTS: Thirty-seven anovulatory PCOS subjects were included in the study. Following MI treatment, 23 of the 37 women (62%) ovulated, while 14 (38%) were resistant and did not ovulate. In the latter group, MI plasma levels did not increase. These MI-resistant patients underwent treatment in the main phase of the study, receiving MI and α-LA. After this combined treatment, 12 (86%) of them ovulated. Their MI plasma levels were found to be significantly higher than at baseline; also, a hormone and lipid profile improvement was recorded. CONCLUSION: The combination of MI with α-LA allowed us to obtain significant progress in the treatment of PCOS MI-resistant patients. Therefore, this new formulation was able to re-establish ovulation, greatly increasing the chances of desired pregnancy.

      "abstract": "Obesity-induced adipose inflammation has been demonstrated to be a key cause of insulin resistance. Peptides derived from bovine α-lactalbumin have been shown to inhibit the activities of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), scavenge 2,2'-azinobis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate] (ABTS⁺) radical and stimulate glucagon-like peptide-2 secretion. In the present study, the effects of bovine α-lactalbumin hydrolysates (α-LAH) on adipose insulin resistance and inflammation induced by high-fat diet (HFD) were investigated. The insulin resistance model was established by feeding C57BL/6J mice with HFD (60% kcal from fat) for eight weeks. Then, the mice were fed with HFD and bovine α-LAH of different doses (100 mg/kg b.w., 200 mg/kg b.w. and 400 mg/kg b.w.) for another 12 weeks to evaluate its protective effects against HFD-induced insulin resistance. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ipITT) were conducted after intervention with α-LAH for 10 weeks and 11 weeks, respectively. Results showed that bovine α-LAH significantly reduced body weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, and HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) levels, lowered the area-under-the-curve (AUC) during OGTT and ipITT, and downregulated inflammation-related gene [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1] expression in adipose tissues of HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, bovine α-LAH also suppressed insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) serine phosphorylation (Ser307, Ser612), enhanced protein kinase B (known as Akt) phosphorylation, and inhibited the activation of inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in adipose tissues of HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice. These results suggested that bovine α-LAH could ameliorate adipose insulin resistance and inflammation through IKK and MAPK signaling pathways in HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice.",

      "abstract": "The formation and deposition of protein fibrillar aggregates in the tissues is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Molecular chaperones are a family of proteins that are believed to have the ability to inhibit protein aggregation. The present study examines the effect of different concentrations of green synthesis silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from Pulicaria undulata L. on the aggregation of α-lactalbumin (α-LA) and the chaperone action of αs-casein. The effects of the AgNPs were determined by measuring light scattering absorption, fluorescence (ThT assay, intrinsic fluorescence assay and ANS binding assay), TEM, CD spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE. The results showed that AgNPs have the ability to prevent the aggregation of α-LA in a concentration-dependent manner. In fact, by increasing the concentration of AgNPs within a specified range, the adsorption and interaction between AgNPs and protein have increased and protein conformational changes and self-association decreased, thus amyloid aggregation is prevented. Our results also showed that α-casein effectively prevented the aggregation of the α-lactalbumin which increased in the presence of the AgNPs. Standard experimental results, however, proved that nanoparticles had no effect on the structure and hence the chaperone ability of α-casein. Our findings showed that AgNPs can prevent protein aggregation and have no effect on the chaperone ability of αs-casein. In the main, results of this study show that biosynthesized AgNPs mediated by Pulicaria undulata L. has the capability in inhibiting amyloid fibril formation and thus could be consider as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of amyloidosis disorders.",

      "abstract": "Oxidation and heat treatment can initiate changes in the amino acid composition, structure, solubility, hydrophobicity, conformation, function, and susceptibility to proteolysis of proteins. These can result in adverse consequences for mammals, plants, foodstuffs, and pharmaceuticals. This study investigated whether and how individual or combined treatment with heat, a commonly encountered factor in industrial processing, and H2O2 alters the structure and composition of two major milk whey proteins, α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin, and mixtures of these. Thermal treatment induced reducible cross-links in isolated β-lactoglobulin, but not isolated α-lactalbumin under the conditions employed. Cross-linking occurred at lower temperatures and to a greater extent in the presence of low concentrations of H2O2. H2O2 did not induce cross-linking in the absence of heat. Mixtures of α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin showed similar behavior, except that mixed α-lactalbumin-β-lactoglobulin dimers were detected. Cross-linking was associated with formation of sulfenic acids (RS-OH species), oxidation of methionine residues, cleavage of disulfide bonds in α-lactalbumin, altered conformation of disulfide bonds in β-lactoglobulin, alterations in the fluorescence intensity and maximum emission wavelength of endogenous tryptophan residues, and binding of the hydrophobic probe 8-anilinonaphthalenesulfonate. These data are consistent with increased unfolding and subsequent aggregation of the protein, with these changes being maximized in the presence of both heat and H2O2. The enhanced aggregation detected with H2O2 is consistent with additional pathways to aggregation above that induced by heat alone. These mechanistic insights provide potential strategies for modulating the extent and nature of protein modification induced by thermal and oxidant treatment.",

After α-LA was pretreated by ultrasonication combined with glycation, the treated α-LA showed low intrinsic fluorescence emission and high antioxidant activity at increased ultrasonic power levels. Prior to ultrasonic pretreatment, three glycated sites were identified, whereas the number of glycation sites was increased to four, four, five, and six after ultrasonic power at 60, 90, 120, and 150 W/cm2, respectively, for 15 min. Thus, no obvious difference was found among the glycation sites at the ultrasonic power of 60 and 90 W/cm2. The average degree of substitution per peptide molecule of α-LA was used to evaluate the glycation level per glycation site. All the samples pretreated by ultrasonication exhibited a higher glycation level compared with the untreated samples. Ultrasonic power at 150 W/cm2 showed the most highly enhanced glycation extent and antioxidant activity. Therefore, the intensified glycation extent and the conformational changes of protein were responsible for the increase of antioxidant activity of α-LA. Moreover, high-resolution mass spectrometry is an efficient technique to understand the mechanism of the improved antioxidant activity.",

The rats were maintained on either a standard AIN-93 M or αLA-enriched diet starting one week before the DMN injection until the termination of the experiment. The DMN treatment produced a progressive increase in the plasma markers (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bililbin, hyarulonic acid, and matrix metalloproteinase-2) in 28 days after the first DMN injection. Dietary treatment with αLA significantly reduced the DMN-induced damage toward normalcy. NＧ-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, significantly attenuated the hepatoprotective effect of αLA.

At neutral pH, heat treatment was found to improve foamability, whereas at acid pH (4.3) this property decreased. Foams were more stable after a heat treatment at pH 4.3 than at 6.5, due to higher levels of protein aggregation at low pH. Heat treatment at 90°C for 30min affected the physicochemical properties of the camel α-lactalbumin by increasing free thiol group concentration at pH 6.5.

Turbidity of heated mixtures indicated the formation of suspended aggregates, with greater values observed at higher pH, without attached PEG, and among samples with 8.9 kDa chitosan. Mixtures containing 113 kDa chitosan-PEG formed precipitating aggregates above pH 5, coinciding with a low-magnitude colloidal charge and average hydrodynamic radii > 400 nm. All other tested mixtures were stable to precipitation and possessed average hydrodynamic radii ~100 nm, with atomic force microscopy showing homogeneous distributions of spherical nanogel aggregates. Over all of the tested conditions, attached PEG led to no additional significant changes in the size or morphology of nanogels formed from the protein and chitosan. While PEG may have interfered with the interactions between protein and the 113 kDa chitosan, prompting greater aggregation and precipitation, PEG did not indicate any such interference for shorter chitosan chains."

We examined molecular conformations using circular dichroism spectrum measurement and cell growth activity using the WST-1 method for the proteins. α-LA isolated from each of these four types of market milk displayed no significant structural difference as compared to raw milk α-LA, while α-LA of UHT-I only inhibited cell growth of an intestinal epithelial cell line more potently than raw milk α-LA. In the case of β-LG, only the UHT-I sample demonstrated a drastic change in structure, while it did not exhibit any cytotoxicity. We found that cell viability effects of α-LA and β-LG are attributable to the type of UHT; indirect and direct.

Although apoptosis and autophagy are activated and the functions of several organelles are disrupted in response to α-LA-OA, the detailed antitumor mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used a novel technique, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, to analyze the proteome of tumor cells treated with α-LA-OA. We identified 112 differentially expressed proteins: 95 were upregulated to satisfy the metabolism of tumor cells; 17 were downregulated and targets of α-LA-OA. According to the differentially expressed proteins, α-LA-OA exerted its antitumor activity by disrupting cytoskeleton stability and cell motility, and by inhibiting DNA, lipid, and ATP synthesis, leading to cellular stress and activation of programmed cell death. This study provides a systematic evaluation of the antitumor activity of α-LA-OA, identifying its interacting targets and establishing the theoretical basis of α-LA-OA for use in cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "α-Lactalbumin (aLA) has been shown to form complexes with oleic acid (OA), which may target cancer cells. We recently showed that aLA and several other proteins all form protein-OA complexes called liprotides with a generic structure consisting of a micellar OA core surrounded by a shell of partially denatured protein. Here we report that a heat treatment and an alkaline treatment method both allow us to prepare liprotide complexes composed of aLA and a range of unsaturated fatty acids (FA), provided the FAs contain cis (but not trans) double bonds. All liprotides containing cis-FA form both small and large species, which all consist of partially denatured aLA, though the overall shape of the species differs. Small liprotides have a simple core-shell structure while the larger liprotides are multi-layered, i.e. they have an additional layer of both FA and aLA surrounding the outside of the core-shell structure. All liprotides can transfer their entire FA content to vesicles, releasing aLA as monomers and softening the lipid membrane. The more similar to OA, the more efficiently the different FAs induce hemolysis. We conclude that aLA can take up and transfer a wide variety of FA to membranes, provided they contain a cis-bond. This highlights liprotides as a general class of complexes where both protein and cis-FA component can be varied without departing from a generic (though sometimes multi-layered) core-shell structure.",

OA has been shown to play a key role in the activity of HAMLET and its related complexes, generally known as protein-fatty acid (PFA) complexes. In contrast to what is known about the fate of the protein component of such complexes, information about what happens to OA during their action is still lacking. We monitored the membrane, OA and protein components of bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with OA (BLAOA; a HAMLET-like substance) and how they associate with each other. Using ultracentrifugation, we found that the OA and lipid components follow each other closely. We then firmly identify a transfer of OA from BLAOA to both artificial and erythrocyte membranes, indicating that natural cells respond similarly to BLAOA treatment as artificial membranes. Uncomplexed OA is unable to similarly affect membranes at the conditions tested, even at elevated concentrations. Thus, BLAOA can spontaneously transfer OA to a lipid membrane. After the interaction with the membrane, the protein is likely to have lost most or all of its OA. We suggest a mechanism for passive import of mainly uncomplexed protein into cells, using existing models for OA's effect on membranes. Our results are consistent with a membrane destabilization mediated predominantly by OA insertion being a significant contribution to PFA cytotoxicity.",

Scanning electron, as well as atomic force microscopy of the sample confirmed the formation of multilayered GOns with an average sheet length of 150 nm. X-ray diffraction pattern and Raman spectra also confirmed the formation of GOns. Furthermore, GOns was successfully functionalized (FGOns) by cross-linking with a small protein bovine α-lactalbumin (BLA). The crosslinking of protein with GOns in FGOns was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, and the conformational change of BLA was observed by fluorescence, as well as circular dichroism spectroscopy. When applied to human erythrocytes, GOns demonstrated profound hemolysis; however, such hemolytic effect was drastically reduced by FGOns. To evaluate the potential biomedical application of FGOns, the cytotoxicity of the sample was also assessed. The administration of both GOns and FGOns in breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 demonstrated more than 88% cell death within 24 h and such cytotoxicity against cancer cells was caused due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as revealed from the N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, a ROS-inhibitor)-based assay. FGOns demonstrated excellent biocompatibility against normal cells such as HaCaT and 3T3 compared to GOns that demonstrated dose-dependent toxicity. Moreover, FGOns demonstrated more efficient cellular uptake than GOns by cancer cells. Therefore, our present study demonstrated that the functionalization of GOns using small protein could improve its biocompatibility multifold and such strategy might represent wide opportunity to use GO like nanomaterial safely in various biomedical applications.",

However, there is still a substantial debate about the role of the protein in these complexes. To shed light into this, we obtained three different BAMLET complexes using varying synthesis conditions. Our data suggest that to form active BAMLET particles, OA has to reach critical micelle concentration with an approximate diameter of 250 nm. Proteolysis experiments on BAMLET show that OA protects the protein and is probably located on the surface, consistent with a micelle-like structure. Native or unfolded α-lactalbumin without OA lacked any tumoricidal activity. In contrast, OA alone killed cancer cells with the same efficiency at equimolar concentrations as its formulation as BAMLET. Our data show unequivocally that the cytotoxicity of the BAMLET complex is exclusively due to OA and that OA alone, when formulated as a micelle, is as toxic as the BAMLET complex. The contradictory literature results on the cytotoxicity of BAMLET might be explained by our finding that it was imperative to sonicate the samples to obtain toxic OA."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A new treatment option for persistent cow's milk allergy (CMA) is oral immunotherapy (OIT). Not all patients develop tolerance during therapy, and markers to identify those who will benefit from it are needed. The objective was to study the IgE and IgG4 antibody profiles to milk and milk proteins before and after OIT in relation to clinical outcome. METHODS: Seventy-six children (5-17 years) with challenge-verified CMA were subjected to a 6-month OIT protocol. The treatment aimed at reaching a maintenance dose of 200 ml CM (high dose = HD). Those who did not reach target were analysed as a low-dose (LD) group. Sera were characterized before and after OIT regarding serum levels of IgE and IgG4 to milk and five milk allergen components evaluated together with clinical CMA symptoms and outcome of OIT. RESULTS: Fifty-five (72%) patients reached the maintenance dose (HD) during therapy. High specific IgE levels towards the milk allergens α-lactalbumin (P = 0.048), β-lactoglobulin (P = 0.006) and casein (P = 0.015) before OIT start were associated with lower maintenance dose reached. Patients who developed desensitization had a larger increase in IgG4 levels to α-lactalbumin (P = 0.034), β-lactoglobulin (P = 0.010), casein (P = 0.047) and lactoferrin (P = 0.030) during treatment than those who failed. CONCLUSIONS: Component-resolved diagnostics before OIT can help to identify children with lower probability of a successful OIT outcome, as high IgE levels to α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin and casein are associated with lower maintenance dose reached. An increase in the IgG4 concentration to milk components during treatment indicated effective desensitization.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Complexes of oleic acid (OA) with milk α-lactalbumin, received remarkable attention in view of their selective toxicity towards a spectrum of tumors during the last two decades. OA complexes of some structurally related/unrelated proteins are also tumoricidal. Erythrocytes are among the few differentiated cells that are sensitive and undergo hemolysis when exposed to the complexes. METHODS: The effects of OA complex of bovine α-lactalbumin (Bovine Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells, BAMLET) on human, goat and chicken erythrocytes on calcein leakage, phosphatidylserine exposure, morphological changes and hemolysis were studied by confocal microscopy, FACS analysis, scanning electron microscopy and measuring hemoglobin release. RESULTS: Erythrocytes exposed to BAMLET undergo eryptosis-like alterations as revealed by calcein leakage, surface phosphatidylserine exposure and transformation to echinocytes at low concentrations and hemolysis when the concentration of the complex was raised. Ca(2+) was not essential and restricted the alterations when included in the medium. The BAMLET-induced alterations in human erythrocytes were prevented by the cation channel inhibitors, amiloride and BaCl2 but not by inhibitors of thiol proteases, sphingomyelinase and by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. CONCLUSIONS: The work shows for the first time that low concentrations of BAMLET induces eryptosis in erythrocytes by a novel mechanism not requiring Ca(2+) and hemolysis by detergent-like action by the released OA at higher concentrations. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The study points out to the need for a comprehensive evaluation of the toxicity of OA complexes of α-lactalbumin and other proteins towards erythrocytes and other differentiated cells before being considered for therapy.",

By increasing the temperature of pre-treatment, changes in ALA conformation allowed for greater surface hydrophobicity and caused changes in its surface charge. pH also influenced surface charge for ALA where enhanced repulsion at pH 7.00 was observed resulting in reduced aggregation despite having greater hydrophobicity. Findings indicate that changes to protein conformation using various pH and temperature pre-treatments influenced their surface chemistry, aggregation and ability to align at the oil-water interface. Overall, emulsions were found to be more stable at pH 7.0 than 5.0 due to the greater amount of electrostatic repulsive forces between droplets present at pH 7.0. Under the conditions examined in this study, ALA-3 pre-treated at 65 °C and at pH 7.00 resulted in the best emulsifying properties.",

In addition, it affects mood state and causes physical fatigue. Athletes require both mental and physical conditioning to execute good performance. In this study, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the immunopotentiation and fatigue-alleviation effects of Lactobacillus gasseri OLL2809 (LG2809) and α-lactalbumin (αLA) in university-student athletes after strenuous exercise. A total of 44 university students who performed strenuous exercise daily were separated into 3 groups to receive a 4-week course of placebo, 100 mg LG2809, or 100 mg LG2809 in combination with 900 mg αLA, respectively. Before and after each dietary treatment, the subjects performed strenuous cycle ergometer exercise for 1 h. Before and after each exercise session, blood samples and visual analogue scale scores for fatigue were obtained. In addition, the mood of each subject before and after the dietary treatment was evaluated using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. LG2809 ingestion was effective in preventing reduced natural killer cell activity due to strenuous exercise and elevating mood from a depressed state. In addition, LG2809 + αLA was found to alleviate minor resting fatigue, which was supported objectively by the significant reduction in the serum reactive oxygen metabolites and transforming growth factor β1 levels. These effects could be helpful for athletes to maintain mental and physical condition.",

Therefore, we studied the molecular properties of HAMLET and its goat counterpart, GAMLET (goat α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells), by pulse field gradient NMR and 920-MHz two-dimensional NMR techniques. We also examined the expression of HAMLET-like activities of complexes between oleic acid and other proteins that form a stable molten globule state. We observed that both HAMLET and GAMLET at pH 7.5 were heterogeneous, composed of the native protein, the monomeric molten globule-like state, and the oligomeric species. At pH 2.0 and 50 °C, HAMLET and GAMLET appeared in the monomeric state, and we identified the oleic acid-binding site in the complexes by two-dimensional NMR. Rather surprisingly, the binding site thus identified was markedly different between HAMLET and GAMLET. Furthermore, canine milk lysozyme, apo-myoglobin, and β2-microglobulin all formed the HAMLET-like complex with the anti-tumor activity, when the protein was treated with oleic acid under conditions in which their molten globule states were stable. From these results, we conclude that the protein portion of HAMLET, GAMLET, and the other HAMLET-like protein-oleic acid complexes is not the origin of their cytotoxicity to tumor cells and that the protein portion of these complexes plays a role in the delivery of cytotoxic oleic acid molecules into tumor cells across the cell membrane.",

      "abstract": "Milk proteins are the main components of everyday feeding and demonstrate a promising potential to change the mental condition. However, the effects of milk proteins after prolonged use remain poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of two whey proteins (alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-lac) and native whey) with casein on social and individual behaviour in mice. During a 30 d-long dietary intervention, male C57BL/6J mice had ad libitum access to an experimental diet containing 17% (w/w) of one of three protein sources: a-lac, native whey or casein. Mice had voluntary access to a running wheel. Social behaviour (group and resident-intruder activity) was tested at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Half of each dietary group was then withdrawn from the diet and running wheel for 7 d, and social activity and individual behaviour tests (open field, elevated-plus maze, light–dark box and forced swimming) were performed, to evaluate anxiety and depression-like status. The study shows that the long-term ingestion of whey proteins may modulate behaviour when compared with casein. Diet enriched with a-lac exhibited anxiolytic and antidepressive activities while the whey diet improved sociability. The differences between the diet groups were pronounced under the running wheel and the withdrawal of the experimental diet, suggesting that the beneficial effects of the milk proteins are clearer in stressful situations. Diet-induced behavioural changes remained visible for a week after feeding, which suggests that the proteins of the milk whey fraction have prolonged efficacy on the mental state of mice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most colon cancers start with dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signalling and remain a major therapeutic challenge. Examining whether HAMLET (human α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumour cells) may be used for colon cancer treatment is logical, based on the properties of the complex and its biological context. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if HAMLET can be used for colon cancer treatment and prevention. Apc(Min)(/+) mice, which carry mutations relevant to hereditary and sporadic human colorectal tumours, were used as a model for human disease. METHOD: HAMLET was given perorally in therapeutic and prophylactic regimens. Tumour burden and animal survival of HAMLET-treated and sham-fed mice were compared. Tissue analysis focused on Wnt/β-catenin signalling, proliferation markers and gene expression, using microarrays, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Confocal microscopy, reporter assay, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, ion flux assays and holographic imaging were used to determine effects on colon cancer cells. RESULTS: Peroral HAMLET administration reduced tumour progression and mortality in Apc(Min)(/+) mice. HAMLET accumulated specifically in tumour tissue, reduced β-catenin and related tumour markers. Gene expression analysis detected inhibition of Wnt signalling and a shift to a more differentiated phenotype. In colon cancer cells with APC mutations, HAMLET altered β-catenin integrity and localisation through an ion channel-dependent pathway, defining a new mechanism for controlling β-catenin signalling. Remarkably, supplying HAMLET to the drinking water from the time of weaning also significantly prevented tumour development. CONCLUSIONS: These data identify HAMLET as a new, peroral agent for colon cancer prevention and treatment, especially needed in people carrying APC mutations, where colon cancer remains a leading cause of death.",

The objective of this work was to study the effect of changes in hydrophobic interactions by using different desolvating agents (acetone, ethanol, or isopropanol) and the use of a heat or high-pressure treatment step before the desolvation process on the size, structure, and properties of α-LA nanoparticles. In all cases, a high average particle yield of 99.63% was obtained. Smaller sizes (152.3 nm) can be obtained with the use of acetone as the desolvating agent and without any pretreatment. This is the first time that α-LA nanoparticles in the size range of 100 to 200 nm have been obtained. These nanoparticles, with an isoelectric point of 3.61, are very stable at pH values >4.8, based on their ζ-potential, although their antioxidant activity is weak. The use of the desolvating agent with the smallest polarity index (isopropanol) produced the largest particles (293.4 to 324.9 nm) in all cases. These results support the idea that controlling hydrophobic interactions is a means to control the size of α-LA nanoparticles. No effect of pretreatment on nanoparticle size could be detected. All types of nanoparticles were easily degraded by the proteolytic enzymes assayed.",

      "abstract": "The determination of α-lactalbumin in various dairy products attracts wide attention in multidiscipline fields because of its nutritional and biological functions. In the present study, we quantified the bovine α-lactalbumin in various infant formulas and whey protein concentrates using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Bovine α-lactalbumin was quantified by employing the synthetic internal standard based on the molar equivalent relationship among the internal standard, bovine α-lactalbumin and their signature peptides. This study especially focused on the recovery rates of the sample preparation procedure and robust quantification of total bovine α-lactalbumin in its native and thermally denatured form with a synthetic internal standard KILDKVGINNYWLAHKALCSE. The observed recovery rates of bovine α-lactalbumin ranged from 95.8 to 100.6% and the reproducibility was excellent (RSD<6%) at different spiking levels. The limit of quantitation is 10 mg/100 g for infant formulas and whey protein concentrates. In order to validate the applicability of the method, 21 brands of infant formulas were analyzed. The acquired contents of bovine α-lactalbumin were 0.67-1.84 g/100g in these infant formulas in agreement with their label claimed values. The experiment of heat treatment time showed that the loss of native α-lactalbumin enhanced with an increasing intensity of heat treatment. Comparing with Ren's previous method by analysis of only native bovine α-lactalbumin, the present method at the peptide level proved to be highly suitable for measuring bovine α-lactalbumin in infant formulas and whey protein concentrates, avoiding forgoing the thermally induced denatured α-lactalbumin caused by the technological processing.",

Unexpectedly, some primary cell types were more sensitive to treatment than cancer cell lines. We found the complex to be cytotoxic to all of the tested cells, with a 46-fold difference between the most sensitive and the least sensitive cell type. Oleic acid by itself exhibited a remarkably similar activity. The cell-killing mechanisms of the complex and of oleic acid alone were examined by flow cytometry, testing for apoptosis- and necrosis- inducing activity. The T-cell leukemia-derived Jurkat cells primarily underwent cell death resembling apoptosis, whereas the monocytic leukemia-derived THP1 cells adopted a more necrotic-like cell death. Erythrocytes were sensitive to lysis by the complex and oleic acid. We conclude that oleic acid is cytotoxic by itself and that, in contrast to the literature, a complex of α-lactalbumin and oleic acid has cytotoxic activity against primary cells, as well as cancer cells.",

The diets resulted in 0.8 ± 0.3 g/kg body mass (BM) for SP and significant higher protein intake (24-h nitrogen) of 1.2 ± 0.3 and 1.0 ± 0.3 g/kgBM for SSP and αlac (P < 0.05).

Furthermore, sparing of fat-free mass (FFM) and preservation of REE in function of FFM during weight loss was not significantly different between the αlac-group and the SSP- and SP-groups. In conclusion, the efficacy of αlac in reduction of body weight and fat mass (FM), and preservation of FFM does not differ from the efficacy of similar daily intakes of milk protein during 6 months of energy restriction.",

In this study, heat treatment was used to produce complexes from LAs and oleic acid using a simple method. In the case of human LA and oleic acid, heat-treated samples apparently showed much stronger activities than those treated at room temperature, with cytotoxicities equal to that of HAMLET. Furthermore, circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that heat-treated samples lost their tertiary structure, suggesting a molten globule as oleic acid-bound LA. BLA samples also showed strong activities by heat treatment. Batch production with heat treatment can efficiently convert LAs into tumoricidal complexes.",

      "abstract": "The selective precipitation of alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) at a pH around its isoelectric point (4.2) under heat treatment is the basis for a fractionation process of whey proteins. In these conditions, beta-lactoglobulin remains soluble, whereas bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulins co-precipitate. Knowledge of the mechanism governing the alpha-LA precipitation influences the choice of operating conditions and enables optimization of the fractionation process. alpha-LA is a calcium metallo-protein and its isoelectric precipitation is governed by the protein-calcium complexation equilibrium. Citrate, a sequestrant of calcium, decreases the free calcium concentration and displaces the precipitation phenomenon to a lower temperature range. A study of the effect of citrate on the precipitation phenomena of whey proteins is presented. Whatever the citrate content, precipitation curves for bovine serum albumin (BSA) and alpha-LA intersect at a temperature around 45 degrees C. For a temperature of heat treatment lower than 40 degrees C, a selective enrichment in alpha-LA of the precipitated phase is observed. As addition of citrate leads to high alpha-LA precipitated fractions at a temperature around 35 degrees C, the precipitation step may be performed at this temperature. It results in a reduced heat denaturation of whey proteins and in a higher alpha-LA purity in the precipitated fraction. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Biotechnol Bioeng 56: 391-397, 1997."

However, holo-alpha-lactalbumin was unable to bind fatty acids as measured by this technique. Likewise, no fatty acids bound to holo-alpha-lactalbumin, isolated using nondenaturing conditions, were detected by gas chromatography.

In this study we investigated the effects of alpha-LA on macrophages. We found that treatment with high concentration alpha-LA (> or = 100 microg/ml) could result in a time- and dose-dependent decrease in growth activity, morphological changes, increase in hypodiploid DNA population, and DNA fragmentation in RAW 264.7 cells. We also found that high dose alpha-LA could induce cellular apoptosis and necrosis, as determined by Annexin V binding assay. The alpha-LA could enhance the expression levels of cytochrome c, active caspase 3, active caspase 8, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation without changing the protein levels, but suppress the protein level of Bcl-2. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Boc-D-fmk, failed to block cell death, indicating that alpha-LA-induced cell death was modulated in a caspase-independent manner. In addition, the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, could partially rescue alpha-LA-induced cell death, while the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, could weakly protect cells from death. Our results suggested that activation of ERK1/2 might mediate alpha-LA-induced cell death in RAW 264.7 cells.",

PLS regression was used to correlate the concentrations of alpha-LA and beta-LG to the fluorescence spectra obtained for their mixtures. Data for the calibration and validation of the soft sensor was derived from fluorescence spectra. The process of thermal induced aggregation of beta-LG and alpha-LA protein in mixtures, which involves the disappearance of native-like proteins, was studied under various treatment conditions including different temperatures, pH, total initial protein concentration and proportions of alpha-LA and beta-LG. It was demonstrated that the multivariate regression models used could effectively deconvolute multi-wavelength fluorescence spectra collected under a variety of process conditions and provide a fairly accurate quantification of respective native-like proteins despite the significant overlapping between their emission profiles. It was also demonstrated that a PLS model can be used as a black-box prediction tool for estimating protein aggregation when combined with simple mass balances.",

Samples after 30, 60, and 120 min of heating were analyzed on cooling to room temperature. Size-exclusion chromatography shows sample heterogeneity that increases with the length of heating. After 120 min of heating monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric forms of BLA are present, with aggregates formed from disulfide bond linked hydrolyzed protein fragments. NMR characterization at pH 7 in the presence of Ca2+ of the monomer species isolated from the sample heated for 120 min showed that it consisted of a mixture of refolded native protein and partially folded protein and that the partially folded protein species had spectral characteristics similar to those of the pH 2 molten globule state of the protein. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the non-native species had approximately 40% of the alpha-helical content of the native state, but lacked persistent tertiary interactions. Proteomic analysis using thermolysin digestion of three predominant non-native monomeric forms isolated by high-pressure liquid chromatography indicated the presence of disulfide shuffled isomers, containing the non-native 61-73 disulfide bond. These partially folded, disulfide shuffled species are largely responsible for the pronounced improvement in surface activity of the protein on heating.",

Patients with nonmuscle invasive transitional cell carcinomas were included. Nine patients received 5 daily intravesical instillations of HAMLET (25 mg/ml) during the week before scheduled surgery. HAMLET stimulated a rapid increase in the shedding of tumor cells into the urine, daily, during the 5 days of instillation. The effect was specific for HAMLET, as intravesical instillation of NaCl, PBS or native alpha-lactalbumin did not increase cell shedding. Most of the shed cells were dead and an apoptotic response was detected in 6 of 9 patients, using the TUNEL assay. At surgery, morphological changes in the exophytic tumors were documented by endoscopic photography and a reduction in tumor size or change in tumor character was detected in 8 of 9 patients. TUNEL staining was positive in biopsies from the remaining tumor in 4 patients but adjacent healthy tissue showed no evidence of apoptosis and no toxic response. The results suggest that HAMLET exerts a direct and selective effect on bladder cancer tissue in vivo and that local HAMLET administration might be of value in the future treatment of bladder cancers.",

This study examined if HAMLET-like complexes are present in casein from different species and if isolated alpha-lactalbumin from those species can form such complexes with oleic acid. Casein from human, bovine, equine, and porcine milk was separated by ion exchange chromatography and active complexes were only found in human casein. This was not explained by alpha-lactalbumin sequence variation, as purified bovine, equine, porcine, and caprine alpha-lactalbumins formed complexes with oleic acid with biological activity similar to HAMLET.

      "abstract": "The breast-specific antigen alpha-lactalbumin is expressed in >60% of breast cancer tissues. To evaluate the effect of gene therapy for breast cancer by controlling adenovirus replication with human alpha-lactalbumin promoter, we investigated the activity of a 762-bp human alpha-lactalbumin promoter. Alpha-lactalbumin promoter showed significantly higher activity in MDA-MB-435S and T47D breast cancer cells than in normal breast cell lines or other tumor cell lines. We then developed two novel breast cancer-restricted replicative adenoviruses, AdALAE1a and AdE1aALAE1b. In AdALAE1a, expression of adenoviral E1a gene is under the control of alpha-lactalbumin promoter, and in AdE1aALAE1b, expression of both E1a and E1b genes is under the control of a single alpha-lactalbumin promoter. Both breast cancer-restricted replicative adenoviruses showed viral replication efficiency and tumor cell-killing capability similar to wild-type adenovirus in MDA-MB-435S and T47D cells. The replication efficiency and tumor cell-killing capability of both viruses were attenuated significantly in cells that did not support alpha-lactalbumin promoter. AdE1aALAE1b showed better breast cancer-restricted replication than AdALAE1a, suggesting that a transcriptional targeting modality with alpha-lactalbumin promoter controlling both E1a and E1b gene expression is superior to alpha-lactalbumin promoter controlling only E1a gene expression. Importantly, we found that AdE1aALAE1b could be used to target hormone-independent breast tumors in vivo by inhibiting the growth of MDA-MB-435S s.c. tumors. These data showed that alpha-lactalbumin promoter could regulate the replication of adenovirus to target hormone-independent breast cancers, suggesting that alpha-lactalbumin promoter can be used to develop a novel therapeutic modality for hormone-independent breast cancer.",

However, alkaline conditions are known to cause decomposition of proteins, especially peptide bond cleavage and disulfide degradation. We studied the effects of alkaline on two purified proteins, chicken insulin and bovine alpha-lactalbumin, both containing four disulfide bonds in their structure. The process of covalent bond cleavage was traced by analyzing the mass spectra of the proteins using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). When the proteins are kept at pH 13 in the presence of 0.1% dithithreitol (DTT), peptide bonds at the C-terminal side of asparaginyl residues are preferably cleaved producing succinimides, whereas cysteinyl residues are not decomposed. In the absence of DTT, the disulfide bonds of the proteins are decomposed by alkaline and the cleavage of the peptide bonds are less obvious, possibly because the conformation of the proteins are partially retained until the full decomposition of disulfide bonds. These results identified for the first time the cleavage sites of proteins under alkaline treatment and further suggested the general tendency of the reactions, both in the presence and absence of DTT.",

      "abstract": "In this study, high pressure (HP)-induced denaturation of alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) in dairy systems was examined. In both milk and whey, beta-lg was less baroresistant than alpha-la; both proteins were considerably more resistant to HP-induced denaturation in whey than in milk. HP-induced denaturation of alpha-la and beta-lg increased with increasing proportion of milk in mixtures of milk and whey. Addition of a sulphydryl-oxidising agent, KlO3, to milk or whey increased HP-induced denaturation of beta-lg, but reduced the denaturation of alpha-la. Denaturation of both alpha-la and beta-lg was prevented by adding a sulphydryl-blocking agent, N-ethylmaleimide, to milk or whey prior to HP treatment, highlighting the crucial role of sulphydryl-disulphide interchange reactions in HP-induced denaturation of alpha-la and beta-lg. Removal of colloidal calcium phosphate from milk also reduced HP-induced denaturation of alpha-la and beta-lg significantly. The higher level of HP-induced denaturation of alpha-la and beta-lg in milk than in whey may be the result of the abscence of the casein micelles and colloidal calcium phosphate from whey, which facilitate HP-induced denaturation of alpha-la and beta-lg in milk.",

      "abstract": "Raw skim milk was submitted to high pressure (300 to 600 MPa) and temperature (4 to 70 degrees C) treatments for 2 or 5 min. The combined effects of pressure and temperature on milk proteins induced structural changes and polymer and copolymer formation characterized by anion-exchange and size-exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography and electrophoretic techniques. Approximately half of the beta-lactoglobulin formed polymers, and the other half formed large copolymers, mainly with kappa-casein, alpha-lactalbumin via intermolecular disulfide bond exchange, and alpha(s1)-casein via physicochemical interactions, in proportions of 1.0:0.7:0.3:0.1, respectively. Minor whey proteins (serum albumin, immunoglobulins, and lactoferrin) also participated in the formation of the copolymers but to a lesser extent. Two populations of the copolymers were found with apparent molecular masses ranging from 440 to 2000 kDa for the first and more than 2000 kDa for the second. On the contrary, for heated milks the aggregation kinetics obtained by combination of high pressure and thermal treatment were very fast, as no intermediates such as dimers and small size oligomers were observed after pressurization, whatever the temperature studied. Lactosylation of proteins as well as proteolysis were very limited. A beta-casein amino-terminal peptide of 22 kDa was specifically recovered in milk samples treated under the more drastic conditions (500 MPa/55 degrees C per 5 min and 600 MPa/70 degrees C per 5 min) and might have been generated by neutral proteases such as elastase released from somatic cells present in milk. No casein was released from the micelle whatever the combination of high pressure and temperature studied.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We studied the effect on skin papillomas of topical application of a complex of alpha-lactalbumin and oleic acid (often referred to as human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells [HAMLET]) to establish proof of the principle that alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid kills transformed cells but not healthy, differentiated cells. METHODS: Forty patients with cutaneous papillomas that were resistant to conventional treatment were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, in which alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid or saline placebo was applied daily for three weeks and the change in the volume of each lesion was recorded. After this first phase of the study, 34 patients participated in the second phase, an open-label trial of a three-week course of alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid. Approximately two years after the end of the open-label phase of the study, 38 of the original 40 patients were examined, and long-term follow-up data were obtained. RESULTS: In the first phase of the study, the lesion volume was reduced by 75 percent or more in all 20 patients in the alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid group, and in 88 of 92 papillomas; in the placebo group, a similar effect was evident in only 3 of 20 patients (15 of 74 papillomas) (P<0.001). After the patients in the initial placebo group had been treated with alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid in the second phase of the study, a median reduction of 82 percent in lesion volume was observed. At follow-up two years after the end of the second phase, all lesions had completely resolved in 83 percent of the patients treated with alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid, and the time to resolution was shorter in the group originally assigned to receive alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid than among patients originally in the placebo group (2.4 vs. 9.9 months; P<0.01). No adverse reactions were reported, and there was no difference in the outcomes of treatment between immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with topical alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid has a beneficial and lasting effect on skin papillomas.",

      "abstract": "Malignant brain tumors present a major therapeutic challenge because no selective or efficient treatment is available. Here, we demonstrate that intratumoral administration of human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (HAMLET) prolongs survival in a human glioblastoma (GBM) xenograft model, by selective induction of tumor cell apoptosis. HAMLET is a protein-lipid complex that is formed from alpha-lactalbumin when the protein changes its tertiary conformation and binds oleic acid as a cofactor. HAMLET induces apoptosis in a wide range of tumor cells in vitro, but the therapeutic effect in vivo has not been examined. In this study, invasively growing human GBM tumors were established in nude rats (Han:rnu/rnu Rowett, n = 20) by transplantation of human GBM biopsy spheroids. After 7 days, HAMLET was administered by intracerebral convection-enhanced delivery for 24 h into the tumor area; and alpha-lactalbumin, the native, folded variant of the same protein, was used as a control. HAMLET reduced the intracranial tumor volume and delayed the onset of pressure symptoms in the tumor-bearing rats. After 8 weeks, all alpha-lactalbumin-treated rats had developed pressure symptoms, but the HAMLET-treated rats remained asymptomatic. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed large differences in tumor volume (456 versus 63 mm(3)). HAMLET caused apoptosis in vivo in the tumor but not in adjacent intact brain tissue or in nontransformed human astrocytes, and no toxic side effects were observed. The results identify HAMLET as a new candidate in cancer therapy and suggest that HAMLET should be additionally explored as a novel approach to controlling GBM progression.",

      "abstract": "Dairy industries are interested in knowing the heat treatment undergone by milk so as to control the quality of drinking milks or to control their heating systems. Among the different techniques available to characterize the heat treatment of milk, estimation of the denaturation of proteins has been widely used. However, because the concentration of the proteins in raw milk can fluctuate significantly, determining only the concentration of a native protein without knowing its concentration in the raw milk before undergoing heat treatment can lead to significant imprecision. The objective of this study was to develop, on Biacore 3000, a biosensor assay for determining the denaturation index of alpha-lactalbumin by quantifying separately the native and \"heat-denatured\" forms of alpha-lactalbumin with specific monoclonal antibodies. alpha-Lactalbumin denaturation index is independent of the concentration of alpha-lactalbumin in the original raw milk. The technique developed is discriminating, fast, repeatable, fully automated, and requires no pretreatment of the milk sample.",
