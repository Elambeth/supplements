      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a persistent metabolic disease typified by hyperglycemia, caused by insufficient or ineffective insulin. This study examined the therapeutic effects of metformin combined with coconut water. In this study, twenty male Wistar rats (150-220 g) were divided into four groups: normal control, diabetic control, diabetic treated with metformin, and diabetic treated with metformin plus coconut water. Diabetes was induced using nicotinamide and streptozotocin (STZ), followed by a 21-day oral treatment regimen. Body weight, fasting blood glucose levels, feed, and water intake were measured weekly. A molecular docking study was employed to assess the degree of affinity that compounds of coconut water have for important metabolic proteins. Combination therapies of metformin and coconut water significantly reduced the glucose levels in the blood when compared to the diabetic controls. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between coconut water constituents, particularly chlorogenic acid, and key metabolic proteins, suggesting potential therapeutic effects. The study demonstrates that coconut water, in combination with metformin, effectively ameliorates hyperglycemia and enhances antioxidant enzyme activities in diabetic rats induced with STZ. These results imply that coconut water could serve as a beneficial adjunct treatment for managing DM."

      "abstract": "This study proposes using digital colorimetry combined with unsupervised pattern recognition techniques to obtain a molecular fingerprint profile that allows detection and identification of the non-destructive authenticity of coconut water samples. It also intends to classify the samples sold as in nature, adulterated, or industrialized. The samples were purchased at street markets and local stores in the state of Bahia, northeastern Brazil. The digital images were obtained through direct analysis without pre-treatment of the samples. Then, the combination values of color histograms in RGB channels were extracted using Chemostat software. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering contributed to the classification of the samples. It was possible to prove that digital colorimetry is a useful tool that allows confirming the authenticity of foods quickly and at a low cost. It can contribute to the inspection by regulatory agencies, in addition to following the principles of green analytical chemistry."

      "abstract": "Tender coconut water (TCW) refers to the liquid endosperm of coconut developed in 6-9 months, which is prone to deterioration during postharvest storage. This study explored the impact of ultrasound (20 kHz, 2400 w and 20 min) on the quality of TCW during postharvest storage. Results showed that ultrasound was effective in preserving the quality of TCW. Especially at the end of storage (15 d), TSS value was increased by 18.38%, titratable acid was increased by 25.17%, turbidity was decreased by 10.58%, and soluble sugar and reducing sugar content were increased by 23.36% and 45.77%, respectively. According to HS-SPME-GC-MS results, a total of 28 volatile organic compounds were identified and the content of volatile organic compounds in TCW showed no significant difference before and after ultrasonic treatment. The E-tongue data demonstrated that ultrasound could effectively affect the taste of TCW, especially enhanced the astringency, aftertaste-A and aftertaste-B values. A total of 56 compounds were identified as differentially expressed metabolites by LC-MS based metabolomics, which were mainly connected with the tricarboxylic acid cycle and flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential use of ultrasound in the storage and preservation of other fruits.",

      "abstract": "The rising demand for freshly cut agricultural produce like bananas, apples, pears, potatoes, and roots due to health concerns and modern lifestyles has heightened awareness of their susceptibility to browning, which diminishes their appeal and contributes to food waste. The present study explored the efficacy of natural anti-browning agents in prolonging the quality and shelf-life of freshly cut green banana slices. The bananas underwent treatment with normal water (NW), lemon juice (LJ), and coconut water (CW), and the changes in physicochemical properties, such as browning intensity, color, firmness, total soluble solid (TSS), total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and also microbial attributes, were evaluated during their storage at 4 ± 1°C for 12 days. The results demonstrated significant enhancements in treated samples compared to untreated ones. While normal water and lemon juice-treated banana slices exhibited visual browning during storage, coconut water immersion proved superior in maintaining visual appeal, whiteness, and lightness while delaying yellowing and browning. Coconut water-treated samples also displayed firmer texture (0.75 kg), lower TSS (5.67 °Brix), and reduced weight loss (9.14%) after 12 days, in contrast to samples subjected to lemon juice and normal water treatments which showed lesser texture (0.68 kg, 0.58 kg), higher TSS (5.87 °Brix, 6.10 °Brix), and greater weight loss (11.76%, 16.09%), respectively. Furthermore, coconut water-treated samples retained higher levels of total phenols (392.67 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalent)/100 g FW (fresh weight), total flavonoids (55.67 mg QE (quercetin equivalent)/100 g FW), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity (38.68%). Coconut water treatment also significantly suppressed polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity (14 U/g) compared to lemon juice (16 U/g) and normal water (26 U/g) treatments, and untreated samples (133 U/g) after 12 days. Additionally, microbial load remained within acceptable limits for all samples, with coconut water-treated samples showing the lowest values. Thus, coconut water is a promising natural solution for inhibiting browning and preserving the quality of fresh-cut green banana slices during storage."

Laboratory tests revealed the neonate had a serum sodium of 113 mmol/L. The seizures stopped after treatment with midazolam, and the sodium was corrected slowly with 3% hypertonic saline without further sequelae. The severe neonatal hyponatremia and seizures were attributed to maternal consumption of excessive amounts of coconut water during labor. This case demonstrates the importance of careful consideration of both fluid volume and fluid electrolyte composition during labor to prevent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Tender coconut water (TCW) is a natural drink rich in natural electrolytes, minerals, salts and sugars; it has good health benefits. But, its shelf-life is very limited because of the active nature of enzymes present in it when exposed to air. Therefore, the processing of TCW is necessary to inactivate the enzymes. So, this study aims to observe the effect of various process parameters of pulsed electric field (PEF) on the quality parameters of TCW. For the treatment of TCW with PEF, a full-factorial design of experiments was followed with process parameters such as three levels of electric field intensity (8, 12, and 16 kV/cm), two levels of pulse width (PW) (50 and 70 μs), and six levels of the number of pulses (2000 to 12,000 pulses) were considered at a constant pulse OFF time of 75 ms. PEF treatment did not significantly change pH, total soluble solids, and viscosity. However, it significantly affected vitamin C, colour, and total and reducing sugars. PEF treatment significantly enhanced the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity by 23.17% and 42.49%, respectively. At the same time, significant inactivation of polyphenol oxidase (100%) and peroxidase (60.2%) was observed at PEF treatment conditions of 16 kV/cm, 70 μs PW, and 12,000 pulses. Moreover, no significant change in the sensory acceptability of PEF-treated TCW (16 kV/cm, 70 μs PW, 12,000 pulses) when compared to the untreated/fresh TCW, which is a promising sign."

      "abstract": "Anaemia is a widespread health issue affecting young children and pregnant women, characterized by reduced red blood cells or haemoglobin levels. Coconut water, rich in nutrients such as L-arginine, iron, vitamin C, vitamin B6, folic acid and fatty acids, is believed to aid in blood formation (hematopoesis). The study aimed to examine the impact of coconut water on hematological indices and lipid profiles in rats with phenylhydrazine-induced anemia. 30 rats were divided into 5 groups: a normal control, phenylhydrazine untreated, coconut water (0.5ml/kg), iron, and ferrous treated groups. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte levels were measured using a Hematology Analyzer. Results showed a significant decrease in LDL and TG levels, and an increase in HDL levels in phenylhydrazine induced anemia compared to the control group. Coconut water administration at 0.5ml/kg reduced LDL, VLDL and TG levels, and increased HDL levels in rats with induced anemia. The study found that coconut water had a positive effect on hematological indices, as it increased hemoglobin and erythrocyte levels in rats with induced anemia. These findings suggest that coconut water may have potential therapeutic benefits for individuals with anemia, particularly in lowering lipid levels and improving blood formation. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to determine the most effective dosage and duration of treatment. Overall, the study highlights the importance of coconut water as a potentially beneficial alternative treatment for anemia.",

      "abstract": "In order to investigate the potential mechanisms of probiotic-fermented coconut water in treating enteritis, this study conducted a comprehensive analysis of the effects of probiotic intervention on the recovery from Dextran Sodium Sulfate-induced acute enteritis in Wenchang chicks. The analysis encompassed the assessment of growth performance, serum indicators, intestinal tissue structure, and metagenomic and metabolomic profiles of cecal contents in 60 Wenchang chicks subjected to intervention. This approach aimed to elucidate the impact of probiotic intervention on the recovery process from acute enteritis at both the genetic and metabolic levels in the avian model. The results revealed that intervention with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y301 improved the growth rate of chicks. and intervention with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum MS2c regulated the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway and reshaped the gut microbiota structure in modeling chicks with acute enteritis, reducing the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria from the Alistipes and increasing the abundance of potentially beneficial species from the Christensenellaceae. This intervention resulted in the production of specific gut metabolites, including Gentamicin C and polymyxin B2, recognized for their therapeutic effects on acute enteritis. The combined intervention of S. cerevisiae Y301 and L. plantarum MS2c not only enhanced growth performance but also mitigated intestinal wall damage and increased the abundance of gut metabolites such as gentamicin C and polymyxin B2, thereby mitigating symptoms of enteritis. Furthermore, this combined intervention reduced the levels of serum immune markers, including IL-10, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and D-lactic acid, thus mitigating intestinal epithelial cell damage and promoting acute enteritis recovery. This study provides crucial insights into the mechanisms of action of probiotics and probiotic-fermented coconut water in acute enteritis recovery, offering new perspectives for sustainable farming practices for Wenchang chicken."

Gut microbiome modulation improves outcomes in ulcerative colitis (UC), and potassium possesses in vitro anti-inflammatory property. We evaluated the effect of CW as an adjunct therapy for patients with mild-moderate UC. METHODS: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized patients with mild to moderate (Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI]: 3-9) endoscopically active UC (Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity [UCEIS] >1) in 1:1 ratio to CW + standard medical therapy (SMT) vs placebo + SMT. Four hundred mL of CW was administered for 8 weeks. Primary outcome measure was clinical remission (SCCAI ≤2), and secondary outcome measures were clinical response (SCCAI decline ≥3) and adverse events at 8 weeks. Microbiome was analyzed at baseline and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Of 121 patients screened, 95 were included for modified intention to treat analysis (CW, n = 49; placebo, n = 46) (mean age, 37.2 ± 11.2 years; males, 54.1%; disease duration, 48 months [interquartile range (IQR), 24-90 months]; pancolitis, 26.1%; SCCAI, 5 [IQR, 4-6]; UCEIS, 4 [IQR, 3-5]). Clinical response (57.1% vs 28.3%; odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-7.9; P = .01), remission (53.1% vs 28.3%; OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-6.7; P = .02), and proportion of patients with fecal calprotectin (FCP) <150 μg/g (30.6% vs 6.5%; OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.7-23.6; P = .003) were significantly higher in CW. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa that had a significant or trend towards negative correlation with SCCAI, UCEIS, or FCP increased at 8 weeks in CW, and this effect was independent of disease activity and dietary fiber. Adverse events were comparable, and no patient developed hyperkalemia. CONCLUSIONS: CW was more effective than placebo for induction of clinical remission in patients with mild to moderate UC. The trial was prospectively registered on Clinical Trials Registry of India (ctri.nic.in, Number: CTRI/2019/03/01827).",

After thawing, the samples were evaluated for sperm kinetics, membrane evaluation and in vivo insemination. For cryopreservation, a pool was made with the ejaculate of six goats, diluted in four equal aliquots for the respective treatments: T1 (ACP-Lact®); T2 (ACP-Lact® 50%); T3 (ACP + 2.5% egg yolk) and T4 (Tris + 2.5% egg yolk). After dilution of the treatments, the samples were placed in 0.5 ml straws and chilled at a rate of -1.07°C/min. After reaching 4°C and stabilizing for one hour, the straws were placed in nitrogen vapour at -60°C for 15 minutes and then immersed in liquid nitrogen (-196ºC). The straws were thawed in a 37°C water bath and kinetic assessments were performed immediately using a computerized semen analysis program (CSA), viability (EN), membrane functionality (HOST), mitochondrial activity (DAB) and DNA integrity assessment of spermatozoa. For the in vivo experiment, ten goats were inseminated, divided into two groups of five goats each, G1 inseminated with ACP-Lact® and G2 with ACP, by fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI). Regarding the kinetic parameters, the ACP-Lact® treatment showed higher progressive motility (PM) and sperm velocity than the other treatments (36.77%). In the VSL parameter the ACP-Lact diluent was superior to ACP and Tris. In viability the treatment with ACP-Lact® was superior to the treatment with Tris, 95% and 83% respectively. In FTAI two goats were born out of the 5 goats inseminated with ACP-Lact®. It was concluded that the use of ACP-Lact® for cryopreservation of caprine semen is efficient in maintaining seminal parameters during thawing in vitro and in vivo and proved to be a good alternative extender for the caprine species."

      "abstract": "The global coconut water market is projected to grow in the upcoming years, attributed to its numerous health benefits. However, due to its susceptibility to microbial contamination and the limitations of non-thermal decontamination methods, thermal treatments remain the primary approach to ensure the shelf-life stability and the microbiological safety of the product. In this study, the thermal inactivation of Listeria innocua, a Listeria monocytogenes surrogate, was evaluated in coconut water and in tryptone soy broth (TSB) under both isothermal (50-60 °C) and dynamic conditions (from 30 to 60 °C, with temperature increases of 0.5, 1 and 5 °C/min). Mathematical models were used to analyse the inactivation data. The Geeraerd model effectively described the thermal inactivation of L. innocua in both TSB and coconut water under isothermal conditions, with close agreement between experimental data and model fits. Parameter estimates and analysis revealed that acidified TSB is a suitable surrogate medium for studying the thermal inactivation of L. innocua in coconut water, despite minor differences observed in the shoulder length of inactivation curves, likely attributed to the media composition. The models fitted to the data obtained at isothermal conditions fail to predict L. innocua responses under dynamic conditions. This is attributed to the stress acclimation phenomenon that takes place under dynamic conditions, where bacterial cells adapt to initial sub-lethal treatment stages, leading to increased thermal resistance. Fitting the Bigelow model directly to dynamic data with fixed z-values reveals a three-fold increase in D-values with lower heating rates, supporting the role of stress acclimation. The findings of this study aid in designing pasteurization treatments targeting L. innocua in coconut water and enable the establishment of safe, mild heat treatments for refrigerated, high-quality coconut water."

Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available for pain relief, but information on their effectiveness, particularly regarding green coconut water, dark chocolate, and Ibuprofen, remains limited. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of green coconut water, dark chocolate bars, and Ibuprofen in reducing the intensity of primary dysmenorrhea. In this research, a randomized controlled trial with a quantitative design was conducted, involving 45 participants randomly assigned to receive 330 mL of green coconut water, 35 g of 70% dark chocolate, or 400 mg Ibuprofen. The interventions were administered on the first day of menstruation when dysmenorrhea symptoms typically occur in subjects. This study used a single-dose approach to evaluate the immediate impact of each treatment. The subjects were instructed to consume the given interventional product within 15 min. The pain intensity was measured using a Numeric Rating Scale before the intervention and 2 h after the subjects finished consuming the interventional product. The multivariate Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant difference in effectiveness among the three interventions (p < 0.05). The study found that Ibuprofen was the most effective intervention compared to the other interventions. These findings contribute to understanding the treatment options for primary dysmenorrhea and emphasize the efficacy of Ibuprofen (trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05971186).",

To avoid the presence of pathogens, beverages have been subjected to thermal treatments, such as sterilization or pasteurization, which can interfere with the physicochemical, rheological, functional, and organoleptic properties of the final product. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of heat treatment on the physicochemical properties, such as acidity, pH, total solids, density, total and reducing sugar, as well as the antioxidant activity of a beverage formulated from rice flour (RF) and coconut water (CW). Three beverage formulations were evaluated: A (2% RF; 98% CW), B (5% RF; 95% CW), and C (8% RF; 92% CW), each of which was subjected to two heat treatments: sterilized (121 °C/15 psi/15 min) or pasteurized (60 °C/60 min and subsequently 73 °C/15 s). The heat treatments increased the acidity and reducing sugars but decreased pH, total sugar, and antioxidant activity. As for the rheological properties, the mixtures were pseudoplastic fluid. The physicochemical properties from RF and CW mixtures were dependent on the heat treatment, but these can be introduced as new nondairy substrates for the elaboration of functional beverages to be consumed mainly by those lactose intolerant."

The consumption of water and coconut water was tracked. Across 105 church events in the three jurisdictions, the count of water bottles before and after events decreased from 142.8 to 22.3, the number of coconuts before and after events decreased from 19.6 to 1.2, and cups of water before and after events decreased from 52.9 to 7.6. The promotion of healthy beverages in church settings holds promise in the Pacific as a feasible, accessible, and culturally responsive nutrition approach, given limited access to other nutritional alternatives, e.g., fresh fruits and vegetables.

Bio-preservative treatments were carried out after optimized heat treatment (85°C for 5 min) of TCW to establish its storage characteristics. Various concentrations (up to 125 ppm) of bio-preservatives were used for the preservation, and quality parameters of resultant TCW were assessed based on physicochemical characteristics and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) guidelines and statistical analysis applied. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc test revealed that pH and overall acceptability (OA) are the major governing factors that determine spoilage of TCW (p < 0.05). Overall, the polylysine combination was found to be most effective in ensuring quality retention of TCW. It was concluded that pasteurized TCW shelf life could be extended up to 20 days using bio-preservatives."

Then cryopreservation was carried out and the samples stored in liquid nitrogen (-196 °C). After seven days, the samples were thawed and assessed for spermatic kinetics, immunofluorescence and sperm morphology. Analysis of GOMN by the CASA system showed that the various parameters were similar to those of GOGD (P>0.05). The membrane integrity, mitochondrial potential and the acrosome were not influenced by the treatment (P>0.05) nor by the dilutant used for cryopreservation (P>0.05). The spermatic morphology was also preserved by the different GOGD and GONM concentrations in the ACP® and TRIS dilutants, with no statistically significant differences (P<0.05). It was concluded that Numida meleagris egg yolk, as external membrane cryoproctant added to the dilutants ACP-101c® and TRIS, improved goat semen quality."

      "abstract": "The acute and prolonged diuretic effects of coconut water (CW) and the underlying mechanism were investigated with a saline-loaded rat model. In an acute diuretic experiment, CW could significantly increase urine excretion. In addition, the treatment of CW significantly increased urinary sodium and chloride ions, thereby considerably increasing the excretion of NaCl. However, the calcium concentration and pH value were not affected. In the prolonged diuretic experiment, CW dramatically increased the urine output and urine electrolyte concentrations (Na+, K+, and Cl-). Furthermore, CW could suppress the activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by decreasing serum antidiuretic hormone, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels, and significantly increasing the serum atriopeptin level. CW treatment significantly reduced the mRNA expressions and protein levels of aquaporin 1 (AQP1), AQP2, and AQP 3. This report provided basic data for explaining the natural tropical beverage of CW as an alternative diuretic agent."

Results showed increasing body weight in high fat fed animals when compared to starch fed control (ND/SFD) group. Treatment with concentrates of PHE and TCW reduced their body weight dose dependently. Lipid profile like triglycerides, cholesterol and LDL levels were significantly decreased, whereas HDL levels increased, indicating its health beneficial effect. Catalase, SOD, GPx, TBARS in tissues, analysis of OGTT, serum insulin levels, advance glycation and atherogenic protection were augmented at different levels in the treated groups.

Results from HS-SPME/GC-MS showed that there was no significant difference in the content of volatile compounds in coconut water before and after US treatment. The activities of sugar metabolism enzymes such as sucrose phosphate synthase, sucrose synthase, acid invertase (AI) and neutral invertase were inhibited by US, of which AI had the strongest inactivation. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra showed that the secondary and tertiary structure of AI molecule were destroyed with the increase of US intensity and time, which was confirmed by the change of particle size distribution pattern and scanning electron microscopy. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics showed that US treatment prevented the recognition and binding of sucrose and AI molecules, thereby inhibiting the decomposition of sucrose. In conclusion, our results indicate that US can inhibit the activity of AI and maintain the sugar content to increase the quality as well as extend the shelflife of coconut water, which will bring more commercial value.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the anti-cataract effects of coconut water (CW) in vivo and in vitro, and to explore the potential pathogenic mechanism. METHODS: In this study, 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control (CO), diabetic (DM), diabetic treated with CW (DM + CW), and diabetic treated with Glibenclamide (DM + Gli). Except for the CO group, in the other three groups, intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg/kg) was conducted to establish diabetic models. The experiment was conducted for 20 weeks. The slit-lamp examination was undertaken during the period of experiment (20 weeks), and then, all rats were sacrificed. The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the left lens were measured by using biochemical assays. The right lens was used for pathological analysis. The rat lens epithelial cells (LECs) were cultured in vitro and the subcultured cell were divided into four groups, namely the normal glucose group (5 mmol /L glucose, Group I), the high glucose group (40 mmol/L glucose, Group II), high glucose +5% CW group (Group III), and high glucose +10% CW group (Group IV). LECs were cultured under the conditions as described above for 48 h. Cell proliferation and the morphological changes were observed with interted phase contrast microscope.The level of cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. the level of SOD, MDA and GSH-Px were also detected. RESULTS: The lens opacity index decreased in diabetic rats, and LECs apoptosis ratio also decreased in high glucose environments that received CW. Under treatment with CW, reduced MDA level and elevated activities of SOD and GSH-Px were detected, both in vivo and in vitro experiments. The increased severity of cataract and LECs apoptosis were noted in diabetic rats that received normal water, while CW markedly mitigated the enhanced cataract severity and the reduction of LECs induced by diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: CW is a functional food that can protect the lens from diabetic cataract. The possible underlying mechanism may be partly explained via the decreased oxidative stress in lens. However, further research needs to be conducted to indicate the pathogenic mechanism of anti-diabetic effects of CW.",

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined the ameliorative potentials of coconut water on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced toxicity in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned into separate cages according to the sex of 5 groups. Groups 2-5 were intraperitoneally injected a single dose of 1 mL/kg CCl4 diluted in olive oil. Only 3, 4 and 5 were orally given 2, 4, 6 mL/kg coconut water respectively, whereas groups 1 and 2 received distilled water. RESULTS: Treatment with coconut water significantly (p < 0.05) increased red blood cell, packed cell volume, haemoglobin, high-density lipoprotein, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, total protein, and albumin compared to the negative control in both sexes of the rats. Furthermore, platelets, white blood cells, urea, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, total cholesterol, malondialdehyde, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine and aspartate transaminases decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared to the negative control in both male and female rats. CONCLUSION: Thus, coconut water supplementation may reverse CCl4 induced toxicity and distortions on haematological parameters, lipid profile and antioxidant enzymes, liver and kidney biomarkers in rats.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical and chemical characteristics of coconut water and to analyze the use of coconut water solution for the conservation of human corneas. METHODS: This was an experimental and controlled study performed at the Eye Bank of the General Hospital of Fortaleza. The coconut water-based solution was prepared at the Goat Seed Technology Laboratory of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of the State University of Ceará. Discarded corneas from the Eye Bank were divided into two groups for sequential experiments: G1, coconut water-based solution (experimental group), and G2, conservative treatment with OPTISOL GS® (control group). The osmolality of corneas in G1 was analyzed sequentially at 275, 300, 325, 345, 365, and 400 mOsm/L. The viability of the corneas was determined by specular microscopy and biomicroscopy on the first, third, and seventh days. RESULTS: Corneas preserved in a solution of 365 and 345 mOsm/L had a transparency of 8 mm until the third day and had diffuse edema in the periphery, central folds, and partial epithelium loss until the seventh day. The 365-mOsm/L solution was associated with the worst results during follow-up. Corneas placed in Optisol-GS retained their original aspects. CONCLUSIONS: Coconut water-based preservative partially maintained corneal transparency and epithelial integrity, especially during the first three days of follow-up. The coconut water-based solutions used were not effective for use as preservatives in a human eye bank.",

Inactivation kinetics of both enzymes were fitted to nonlinear Weibull model with an increase in UV dosage with a high coefficient of determination (R2 > 0.97) and low root mean square error (RMSE < 0.06). No significant change was observed in all essential amino acids (p > 0.05) after UV-C treatment up to maximum delivered fluence of 400 mJ/cm2. Sensory attributes of coconut water up to a treated UV-C fluence level of 200 mJ/cm2 were well retained in terms of chosen descriptors (p > 0.05). This study allow to further investigate the development of UV-C light technology for inhibition of spoilage enzymes and prolonged shelf-life of low acid beverages."

The ovarian fragments were either immediately fixed in Carnoy solution (non-cultured control) or individually cultured for 2 or 6 days. The following culture media (all containing 100 μg/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin) were evaluated: α-MEM (α-MEM alone, without additional supplementation); α-MEM+ (supplemented α-MEM); ACP (ACP®406 alone); or ACP+ (supplemented ACP®406). Additional supplementation includes: 1.25 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/mL insulin, 5.5 μg/mL transferrin, 5 ng/mL selenium, 2 mM glutamine, and 2 mM hypoxanthine. The endpoints (i) follicular morphology; (ii) development; (iii) estradiol production; and (iv) reactive oxygen species (ROS) were recorded. Data were analyzed using chi-square, Turkey, t-test or One-Way ANOVA. Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05. At day 2 of culture, a greater (P < 0.05) percentage of morphologically normal follicles was observed between ACP+ and ACP treatments. Moreover, at day 2 of culture, no hormonal difference (P < 0.05) was observed between ACP+ and both α-MEM treatments. At day 6 of culture when ACP and α-MEM treatments were compared the percentage of healthy follicles were similar (P > 0.05) among treatments. Overall, all treatments had lower primordial follicles (P < 0.05) accompany by greater developing follicles (P < 0.05) percentages than non-cultured control treatment, indicating primordial follicle activation. However, at day 6 of culture, the percentage of primordial follicle development were similar (P > 0.05) among the treatments. Likewise, no differences (P > 0.05) were observed for ROS production and follicular and oocyte diameters among treatments. Therefore, ACP+ has the equivalent efficiency to MEM+ in maintaining the survival and development of goat preantral follicles, representing an alternative plant-based low-cost culture medium for in vitro culture."

This study aimed to determine the antiretinopathy effects of CW on diabetic Sprague Dawley (SD) rats using streptozotocin (STZ) and explore its potential mechanism. After allowing the rats to acclimatize for 7 days, 48 healthy adult male SD rats were selected and randomly divided into 4 groups, involving control (Ctrl), diabetic rats (DM), diabetic rats treated with CW (DM-CW), and diabetic rats treated with glibenclamide (DM-Gli). The diabetic models were established by an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg/kg). The Ctrl group was injected with an equal volume of sodium citrate solution. The experiment was totally conducted during 20 weeks, and then, all rats were sacrificed. The serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were measured; additionally, the activities of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the retina were investigated using biochemical assays. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to observe pathological changes of retinal tissues. In presence of treatment with CW, serum level of MDA was decreased, while serum levels of SOD and GSH-Px were increased; besides, the activities of IL-6 and ICAM-1 in the retina were reduced compared with the DM group. The antiretinopathy feature of CW was confirmed by the increased number of neurons in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), total retina thickness (TRT), and thickness of the retinal nuclear layer (RNL) in diabetic rats. CW can be protective against diabetic retinopathy (DR), and its effects are comparable to Gli. The possible underlying mechanism may be partly explained by decreasing oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory activities in the retina. However, further research should be conducted to reveal the exact mechanism."

      "abstract": "The growing demand for minimally processed foods with clean labels has stimulated research into mild processing methods and natural antimicrobials to replace intensive heating and conventional preservatives, respectively. However, we have previously demonstrated that repetitive exposure of some bacteria to mild heat or subinhibitory concentrations of essential oil constituents (EOCs) may induce the emergence of mutants with increased resistance to these treatments. Since the combination of mild heat with some EOCs has a synergistic effect on microbial inactivation, we evaluated the potential of such combinations against our resistant E. coli mutants. While citral, carvacrol and t-cinnamaldehyde synergistically increased heat inactivation (53.0 °C, 10 min) of the wild-type MG1655 suspended in buffer, only the combination with carvacrol (200 μl/l) was able to mitigate the increased resistance of all the mutants. Moreover, the combination of heat and carvacrol acted synergistically inactivating heat-resistant variants of E. coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43888). This combined treatment could synergistically achieve more than 5 log10 reductions of the most resistant mutants in coconut water, although the temperature had to be raised to 57.0 °C. Therefore, the combination of mild heat with carvacrol appears to hold promise for mild processing, and it is expected to counteract the development of heat resistance.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten semen samples from 10 healthy roosters were subjected to four different treatments. For the treatments, 0.2 ml fresh semen with a sperm concentration of 5.2×109 cell/ml was mixed with T0 (no diluent), T1 (0.34 ml coconut water and 6 µl fructose), T2 (0.274 ml coconut water, 0.12 ml egg yolk, and 6 µl fructose), and T3 (0.34 ml egg yolk and 6 µl fructose) solutions. Each treated solution was stored at 5°C and evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. Macroscopically, semen volume, pH, and sperm concentration were evaluated. The microscopic sperm characteristics examined included total motility (i.e., rapid, medium, or slow), progressive and non-progressive motility, viability, and spermatozoa abnormalities noted at different storage times. The results showed that spermatozoa motility was under 40%. RESULTS: The results indicated that sperm viability significantly affected (p<0.05). The highest mean value of sperm viability on day 7 of storage was found after treatment with the T2 solution (46.100±0.5677%). Similarly, spermatozoa abnormalities were significantly lower after treatment with the T2 solution (6.680±1.702%). CONCLUSION: The addition of a diluent containing coconut water, egg yolk, and fructose helped in the better preservation spermatozoa motility, as well as viability for up to 7 days when the semen samples were stored at 5°C."

A total of 10 bucks and 90 does, all crossbred New Zealand White × chinchilla, were used for the trial. Pooled semen was obtained from bucks using artificial vagina. Semen diluents were prepared at 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% and control 50% normal saline and designated as T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 respectively, in a completely randomised design. Semen analysis was conducted on fresh semen and the various diluted semen immediately at 37 °C. Fifteen does each were randomly allotted to the different treatment and were inseminated with their respective treatment diluted semen using the standard procedure, and conception rate, litter size and productivity index at birth were assessed at kindling. Result obtained revealed that spermatozoa motility and structural membrane integrity of the diluted semen were significantly (p < 0.05) affected by the percentage of dilution. The range of values obtained for spermatozoa motility, structural membrane integrity and acrosome integrity is within the accepted values for good-quality semen. Conception rate, litter size and productivity index at birth were highest in does inseminate with T4 (60%), and the least values were obtained in T5 (80%). In conclusion, coconut water is a suitable diluent for rabbit semen for on-farm artificial insemination, the optimal dilution rate of coconut water in rabbit semen is 60%, which guarantees high conception, litter size and productivity index at birth.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of ultraviolet-C irradiation on the inactivation of microorganisms in coconut water, a highly opaque liquid food (1.01 ± 0.018 absorption coefficient). Ultraviolet-C inactivation kinetics of two bacteriophages (MS2, T1UV) and three surrogate bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes) in 0.1% (w/v) peptone and coconut water were investigated. Ultraviolet-C irradiation at 254 nm was applied to stirred samples, using a collimated beam device. A series of known ultraviolet-C doses (0-40 mJ cm-2) were applied for ultraviolet-C treatment except for MS2 where higher doses were delivered (100 mJ cm-2). Inactivation levels of all organisms were proportional to ultraviolet-C dose. At the highest dose of 40 mJ cm-2, three surrogates of pathogenic bacteria were inactivated by more than 5-log10 (p < 0.05) in 0.1% (w/v) peptone and coconut water. Results showed that ultraviolet-C irradiation effectively inactivated bacteriophage and surrogate bacteria in highly opaque coconut water. The log reduction kinetics of microorganisms followed log-linear and exponential models with higher R2 (>0.95) and low root mean square error values. The D10 values of 3, 5.48, and 4.58 mJ cm-2 were obtained from the inactivation of E. coli, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes, respectively. Models for predicting log reduction as a function of ultraviolet-C irradiation dose were found to be significant (p < 0.05). Fluid optics were the key controlling parameters for efficient microbial inactivation. Therefore, the ultraviolet-C dose must be calculated not only from the incident ultraviolet-C intensity but must also consider the attenuation in the samples. The results from this study imply that adequate log reduction of vegetative cells and model viruses is achievable in coconut water and suggested significant potential for ultraviolet-C treatment of other liquid foods.",

Generation of reactive gas species, viz. ozone and hydrogen peroxides were found to be responsible for microbial inactivation. The addition of 400 ppm citric acid to the TCW effectively reduced ST2 by 5 log10 during HVACP treatment. Under these conditions, higher cellular leakage and morphological damage were observed in ST2. Minimal physico-chemical changes in TCW were observed with HVACP treatment, except for an 84.35% ascorbic acid loss (added externally).

It is also used to treat various ailments of disease, including hepatic disorders, renal disorders, gastric disorders and reproductive disorders. However, the reasons for its effectiveness as a natural antioxidant as well as its testicular protective effects against whole body heat stress (HS)-induced oxidative imbalance remain to be revealed. The present study aimed to elucidate the protective efficacy of TCW on HS-induced testicular damage in a murine system and to explore the possible mechanism of action. Standardized liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to detect the presence of active components in TCW. Male Wistar rats were exposed to acute HS with or without TCW treatment to evaluate the degree of testicular damage, which was monitored through histological as well as biochemical analysis. Assessment of endogenous antioxidant response and the modulation of signaling pathways associated with inflammation were also subjected to immunofluorescence and flow cytometric evaluation. Acute hyperthermia caused an elevation of excess generation of oxygen radicals following the suppression of antioxidant capacity and augmentation of lipid peroxidation in murine testicles, which was restored by treatment with TCW. The results also demonstrated marked phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκBα following the activation of NF-κB-guided pro-inflammation upon HS. TCW treatment reversed the HS-induced proinflammatory state through activation of the Nrf2-assisted antioxidant response, which restored the testicular damage. TCW provided competent scientific evidence to substantiate the claims for its use in the treatment of HS-induced inflammation and inflammation-mediated testicular damage.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: A continuous-flow UV reactor operating at 254nm wave-length was used to investigate inactivation of microorganisms including bacteriophage in coconut water, a highly opaque liquid food. UV-C inactivation kinetics of two surrogate viruses (MS2, T1UV) and three bacteria (E. coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 13311, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115) in buffer and coconut water were investigated (D10 values ranging from 2.82 to 4.54mJ·cm-2). A series of known UV-C doses were delivered to the samples. Inactivation levels of all organisms were linearly proportional to UV-C dose (r2>0.97). At the highest dose of 30mJ·cm-2, the three pathogenic organisms were inactivated by >5 log10 (p<0.05). Results clearly demonstrated that UV-C irradiation effectively inactivated bacteriophage and pathogenic microbes in coconut water. The inactivation kinetics of microorganisms were best described by log linear model with a low root mean square error (RMSE) and high coefficient of determination (r2>0.97). Models for predicting log reduction as a function of UV-C irradiation dose were found to be significant (p<0.05) with low RMSE and high r2. The irradiated coconut water showed no cytotoxic effects on normal human intestinal cells and normal mouse liver cells. Overall, these results indicated that UV-C treatment did not generate cytotoxic compounds in the coconut water. This study clearly demonstrated that high levels of inactivation of pathogens can be achieved in coconut water, and suggested potential method for UV-C treatment of other liquid foods. INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: This research paper provides scientific evidence of the potential benefits of UV-C irradiation in inactivating bacterial and viral surrogates at commercially relevant doses of 0-120mJ·cm-2. The irradiated coconut water showed no cytotoxic effects on normal intestinal and healthy mice liver cells. UV-C irradiation is an attractive food preservation technology and offers opportunities for horticultural and food processing industries to meet the growing demand from consumers for healthier and safe food products. This study would provide technical support for commercialization of UV-C treatment of beverages.",

The present study is undertaken to evaluate the periodontal ligament (PDL) cell viability after storage of teeth in different storage media, namely, coconut water, milk, and saline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty sound human premolars undergoing extraction for orthodontic purpose were selected. The teeth were allowed to lie dry on sand/mud for 30 min followed by which they were randomly divided and stored in three different media, i.e., coconut water, milk, and saline. After 45-min storage in their respective media, the root surface was then scraped for PDL tissue. RESULTS: The ANOVA and Newman-Keuls post hoc procedure for statistical analysis of viable cell count under a light microscope using hemocytometer demonstrated that coconut water preserved significantly more PDL cells viable (P < 0.05) compared with milk and saline. CONCLUSION: Storage media help in preserving the viability of PDL cells when immediate replantation is not possible. This study evaluated the posttraumatic PDL cells' viability following storage in three different storage media. Within the parameters of this study, it was found that coconut water is the most effective media for maintaining the viability of PDL."

This study evaluated the use of ultrasound technology (US) for inactivating/sensitizing coconut water peroxidase (POD). The effect of both US application alone and as a pre-treatment to thermal processing was evaluated. The enzyme activity during US processing was reduced 27% after 30min (286W/L, 20kHz), demonstrating its high resistance. The thermal inactivation was described by the Weibull model under non-isothermal conditions. The enzyme became sensitized to heat after US pre-treatment. Further, the use of US resulted in more uniform heat resistance. The results suggest that US is a good technology for sensitizing enzymes before thermal processing (even for an enzyme with high thermal resistance). Therefore, the use of this technology could decrease the undesirable effects of long times and/or the high temperatures of the conventional thermal processing.",

Samples processed at lower temperature and without sulphite presented pink color under storage. According to chemometrics, samples processed at higher temperature exhibited lower levels of glucose and malic acid. Samples with sulphite processed at 136°C presented lower amount of sucrose, suggesting the degradation of the carbohydrates after harshest thermal treatment. Samples with sulphite and processed at lower temperature showed higher concentration of ethanol. However, no significant changes were verified in coconut water composition as a whole.

Two separate treatments were carried out probiotic (P) and probiotic and prebiotic (PP) added. In both treatments, oatmeal-coconut water matrix was inoculated with 7 log CFU/g of L. plantarum and fermented at 27 °C for 10 h. For the PP treatment, 1 g of inulin/100 mL of the product was added additionally. The fermented products were then refrigerated (4 °C) and the viability of L. plantarum, pH, total acidity, and apparent viscosity of the matrix were monitored at selected time intervals. The shelf life to reach was defined by maintenance of L. plantarum count of 7 log CFU/g product. Refrigerated shelf life was determined to be seven-weeks for the P treatment and five-weeks for PP treatment. A significant reduction of pH was observed at the end of the considered shelf life; conversely, the apparent viscosity of the product did not change significantly."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aims of the present study were to assess whether the antidiabetic activity of mature coconut water (MCW) is mediated through L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway in diabetic rats, and to study the effects of MCW on blood coagulation. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by injecting them with alloxan (150 mg/kg body weight). MCW (4 mL/100 g body weight) and L-arginine (7.5 mg/100 g body weight) was given orally for 45 days. L-NAME was given at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight. Concentrations of blood glucose, plasma insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), L-arginine, urine volume and urinary creatinine levels, activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and arginase as well as the abnormalities in hemostasis and thrombosis were measured in all the experimental groups. RESULTS: Treatment with MCW and L-arginine reduced the concentration of blood glucose and HbA1c in diabetic rats. MCW and L-arginine treatment exhibited significant antithrombotic activity in diabetic rats, which was evident from the reduced levels of WBC, platelets, fibrin, and fibrinogen. MCW and L-arginine treatment prolonged the prothrombin time in diabetic rats and reduced the activity of Factor V. In addition to this, the activity of nitric oxide synthase, liver and plasma arginine content, and urinary nitrite were higher in MCW-treated diabetic rats whereas L-NAME treatment inhibited the beneficial effects induced by MCW and arginine. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly indicate that L-arginine is a major factor responsible for the antidiabetic and antithrombotic potential of coconut water, and is mediated through the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway.",

Several works with CW have been related with antioxidant activity, which is very important in the diabetic state. To evaluate the hypoglycemic and nephroprotective activities of CW, alloxan-induced diabetic rats were pre- and post-treated by gavage with CW (3 mL/kg), caffeic acid (CA) (10 and 15 mg/kg), and acarbose (Acb) (714 μg/kg) during a period of 16 days. Body weight, blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and Amadori products in plasma and kidney homogenates were evaluated in all groups and used as parameters for the monitoring of the diabetic state. The results showed that rats of the CW+diabetic group had maintenance in blood glucose compared with the control group (P<.05) in addition to a decrease of HbA1c levels and increase of body weight when compared with the diabetic group rats (P<.05). The animals of the CA and CA+diabetic groups did not have significant variation of body weight (P<.05) during the experiment; however, they showed decrease in their HbA1c and urea levels in plasma as well as Amadori products in kidney homogenates when compared with the diabetic group (P<.05). Our results indicate that CW has multiple beneficial effects in diabetic rats for preventing hyperglycemia and oxidative stress caused by alloxan.",

Cn-AMP2 (TESYFVFSVGM), an anionic host defence peptide from green coconut water of the plant Cocos nucifera, showed anti-proliferative activity against the 1321N1 and U87MG human glioma cell lines with IC50 values of 1.25 and 1.85 mM, respectively. The membrane interactive form of the peptide was found to be an extended conformation, which primarily included β-type structures (levels > 45%) and random coil architecture (levels > 45%). On the basis of these and other data, it is suggested that the short anionic N-terminal sequence (TES) of Cn-AMP2 interacts with positively charged moieties in the cancer cell membrane. Concomitantly, the long hydrophobic C-terminal sequence (YFVFSVGM) of the peptide penetrates the membrane core region, thereby driving the translocation of Cn-AMP2 across the cancer cell membrane to attack intracellular targets and induce anti-proliferative mechanisms. This work is the first to demonstrate that anionic host defence peptides have activity against human glioblastoma, which potentially provides an untapped source of lead compounds for development as novel agents in the treatment of these and other cancers.",

The present study was aimed to elucidate whether and how the coconut water concentrate (CWC) and its major active phytoconstituent shikimic acid (SA) can effectively protect murine hepatocytes from the deleterious effect of hydroperoxide-mediated oxidative stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bioactivity guided fractionation of CWC resulted in the isolation of a couple of known compounds. Freshly isolated murine hepatocytes were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (1 and 3mM) in the presence or absence of CWC (200 and 400 μg/ml) and SA (40 μM) for the determination of antioxidative, DNA protective, cellular ROS level by modern methods, including immunoblot and flowcytometry to find out the possible mechanism of action. RESULTS: Pre-treatment of hepatocyte with CWC and SA showed significant prevention of H2O2-induced intracellular ROS generation, nuclear DNA damage along with the formation of hepatic TBARS and cellular nitrite. Further, the H2O2 induced cell death was arrested in the presence of CWC through the inhibition of CDC42 mediated SAPK/JNK pathways and activation of other molecules of apoptotic pathways, including Bax and caspase3. Moreover, CWC and SA help in maintaining the GSH level and endogenous antioxidants like Mn-SOD, to support intracellular defense mechanisms, probably through the transcriptional activation of Nrf2; and inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-κB. CONCLUSION: CWC and its active components SA reversed the H2O2 induced oxidative damage in hepatocytes, probably through the inhibition of NF-κB, with the activation of PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway and reduction of apoptosis by interfering the SAPK/JNK/Bax pathway.",

In group II, the animals were administrated 0.75% ethylene glycol in drinking water for the induction of nephrolithiasis. Group III animals were administrated coconut water in addition to ethylene glycol. All the treatments were continued for a total duration of seven weeks. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Treatment with coconut water inhibited crystal deposition in renal tissue as well as reduced the number of crystals in urine. Furthermore, coconut water also protected against impaired renal function and development of oxidative stress in the kidneys. The results indicate that coconut water could be a potential candidate for phytotherapy against urolithiasis.",

Teeth were then randomly divided into three experimental storage solution groups. Other 10 were divided into positive and negative control groups (5 each). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND RESULT: The results were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance and multiple range by using post hoc tests. The results of the prevailing study indicated that coconut water group demonstrated a significantly higher number of viable PDL cells than propolis 50%, and ORS.

The ejaculates were apportioned into aliquots that were diluted in Tris plus 10% egg yolk and 3% glycerol, or in ACP-116c plus 10 or 20% egg yolk and 1.5 or 3% glycerol. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and, after 1 mo, thawed at 37 °C for 1 min. After thawing, samples were evaluated as reported for fresh semen, and also for sperm membrane integrity (fluorescent probes) and kinematic parameters (computerized analysis). Results were presented as means ± SEM. Freezing and thawing decreased sperm characteristics relative to fresh semen. Overall, ACP-116c plus 20% egg yolk and 3% glycerol provided better (P < 0.05) sperm motility and kinetic rating (48 ± 6.1% and 2.8 ± 0.2, respectively) after thawing than Tris extender (30.4 ± 5.7% and 2.4 ± 0.2). However, there were no differences (P > 0.05) among treatments with regard to the other sperm characteristics. Based on computerized motion analysis, total (26.5 ± 5.9%) and progressive (8.1 ± 2.2%) motility were best preserved (P < 0.05) with the above-mentioned treatment. In conclusion, a coconut water-based extender, ACP-116c, plus 20% egg yolk and 3% glycerol, was effective for cryopreservation of semen from collared peccaries.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether tender coconut water (TCW) mitigates oxidative stress in fructose fed hypertensive rats. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed with fructose rich diet and treated with TCW (4 mL/100 g of body weight) for 3 subsequent weeks. Systolic blood pressure was measured every three days using the indirect tail cuff method. At the end of the experimental period, plasma glucose and insulin, serum triglycerides and free fatty acids, lipid peroxidation markers (MDA, hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were analyzed in all the groups. RESULTS: Treatment with TCW significantly lowered the systolic blood pressure and reduced serum triglycerides and free fatty acids. Plasma glucose and insulin levels and lipid peroxidation markers such as MDA, hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes were significantly reduced in fructose fed rats treated with TCW. Activities of antioxidant enzymes are up regulated significantly in TCW treated rats. Histopathological analysis of liver showed that TCW treatment reduced the lipid accumulation and inflammatory infiltration without any significant hepatocellular damage. CONCLUSIONS: The overall results suggest that, TCW treatment could prevent and reverse high blood pressure induced by high fructose diet probably by inhibition of lipid peroxidation, upregulation of antioxidant status and improved insulin sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "A simple and reliable FIA-potentiometric system for rapid assays of chloride in certain food samples is described and evaluated. The system is constituted by an aquarium air pump to propel the carrier solution, a manually operated injector, a homemade dialysis flow cell, a solid-state chloride detector (Ag/AgCl), a reference electrode and a multimeter connected to a microcomputer for data acquisition. The dialysis unit enables direct analysis of liquid food samples without any other previous treatment. The principal novelties are the precision (R.S.D. of 1.2% for whole milk) and rapidity (90 determinations/h) of FIA measurements near and below the lower end of the linear (Nernstian) response region of the chloride ion-selective electrode (ISE), with an estimated detection limit (3s) of 0.4mgL(-1) Cl(-) in the sample injected in donor stream. Data of peak potential versus sample chloride concentration (donor stream) was accurately fitted with a quadratic polynomial over the range between 4 and 1000mgL(-1) (r(2)=0.9999) and used as a calibration curve. The method was applied to the determination of chloride in milk and in coconut water samples. The validation of the results was done by comparison with a NIST reference material (milk) or by capillary electrophoresis (coconut water). For all analysis, no significant difference at a 95% confidence level was observed."

Twelve ejaculates were collected from six dogs. Semen was divided into two aliquots, one for dilution one part semen:one part extender (group 1) and another for a concentration of 200 x 10(6) spermatozoa/mL (group 2). Semen was initially extended at 37 degrees C at a proportion of one part semen:half part extender (1:1/2) for group 1 (A-fraction). For group 2, the volume for a concentration of 200 x 10(6) spermatozoa/mL was calculated and a half of this volume was used for the initial dilution (A-fraction, 37 degrees C). Coconut water extender containing 20% egg yolk was used for this initial dilution in both groups. After dilution, the semen was cooled for 40 min in a thermal box (15 degrees C) and for 30 min in a refrigerator. The other half of the extender (B-fraction) containing egg yolk and glycerol (12%) was added to semen in both groups. Subsequently, the final concentration of glycerol in the extender was 6%. Ejaculates were frozen in 0.25 mL straws 5 cm above the surface of liquid nitrogen and stored at -196 degrees C. After 1 week, straws were thawed at 37 degrees C for 1 min and the microscopic criteria were evaluated. The dilution method had no influence on sperm motility, vigor and normal spermatozoa (71.4 compared with 67.7%). There was no effect of dog, ejaculate within male on post-thaw semen quality. Moreover, there was not a male x treatment interaction. Both treatments were efficient in preserving sperm quality.",

Beverages (i.e. Cola, Sprite etc.) and coconut water may be used as sources of oral fluid when glucose-electrolyte solution is not available. To evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of these soft drinks, the basic data such as electrolytes, sugar, calories, osmolarity and pH were determined. The electrolytes of the beverages were significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than the coconut water, especially potassium. The osmolarity of the beverages, which were 693 mOsm/l, was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than the coconut water (288 mOsm/l); pH of the beverages (3.1) was more acidic (p less than 0.001) than the coconut water (5.4). While the sugar content of the beverages, which were 8.7 gm/dl, was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than the coconut water (1.1 gm/dl). On comparison, all brands of beverages would give more calories than the coconut water however the coconut water would be absorbed more easily than any brand of soft drink beverage.",
