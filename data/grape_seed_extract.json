      "abstract": "Overusing the insecticide imidacloprid (IMD) in agriculture has led to its presence in water bodies, causing serious environmental issues and fish toxicity. This study explored the potential benefits of grape seed extract (GSE) in mitigating IMD-induced growth and hormonal and gastrointestinal toxicity in Nile tilapia. A total of 240 healthy juvenile tilapias Oreochromis niloticus (O. niloticus), weighing an average of 11.44 ± 2.01 g at 2 weeks of age, were divided equally into four groups, each with three replicates. The control group received no special treatment, while the second group was given a diet containing 2% GSE®. The third group was exposed to 1.5 µg IMD per liter of water. The fourth group was subjected to the same IMD exposure and fed a diet containing 2% GSE®. These treatments were administered continuously for 75 days. Growth indices, survival rate, biochemical parameters, and digestive enzymes were measured. In addition, the growth-related hormones, intestinal malondialdehyde (MDA), and catalase (CAT) were evaluated. Histological evaluations were conducted on the stomach, duodenum, ileum, and hepatopancreas, alongside body composition analysis. Exposure to IMD delayed growth, impaired serum biochemistry and digestive enzyme activity, altered body composition, obstructed hormonal responses, decreased CAT activity, and increased intestinal MDA. All tissues exhibited signs of degradation. Combining dietary GSE® with IMD improved the former parameters affected by IMD. In conclusion, research suggests that incorporating GSE® into the diet may help reduce the adverse effects of IMD exposure on Nile tilapia, presenting a promising opportunity to address the environmental impacts of insecticide contamination in aquatic ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis is a worldwide health problem that results in an economic loss. The disease is caused by the protozoan Cryptosporidium spp. Individuals with suppressed immunity, like those with organ transplantation, cancer and human immunodeficiency virus syndrome, suffer from the infection that may lead to the death. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is the approved FDA treatment for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent individuals. There is an urgent need to find a new natural treatment that can replace NTZ in immunosuppressed hosts. The study aimed to use grape seed extract loaded chitosan nanoparticles (GSEx-CHNPs) in treatment of cryptosporidiosis in immunosuppressed male mice. GSEx was prepared by the alcoholic extraction method followed by the identification of its bioactive components. GSEx-CHNPs were synthesized by ionic gelation method and physically characterized then their activities were examined in vitro. The experimental groups, included immunocompetent and immunosuppressed groups, was treated with NPs for 14 days post infection (PI). The results showed the presence of many phenolic compounds in the GSEx. GSEx-CHNPs significantly improved the loss in animals body weight, cleared the infection and amolerated the serum cytokines levels. GSEx-CHNPs showed anti-cryptosporidial activity especially in immunosuppressed mice model. Where, it ameliorated the disturbance in the cytokine profile leading to an anti-inflammatory response.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dental caries is a prevalent oral health issue, primarily resulting from demineralization of the enamel. Remineralizing agents such as sodium fluoride (NaF) have been widely used to counteract this process. Recent studies suggest that natural extracts, such as grape seed extract (GSE), may also have significant remineralizing properties. This study aims to compare the efficacy of GSE and NaF on surface and subsurface enamel lesions in an in vitro setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, 60 extracted human premolars were randomly divided into three groups of 20 each: control (no treatment), NaF treatment, and GSE treatment. Artificial enamel lesions were created on the buccal surfaces of all samples. The NaF group was treated with a 5% sodium fluoride solution, while the GSE group received a 6.5% grape seed extract solution. Treatments were applied daily for 10 days. Surface microhardness (SMH) and cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH) were measured before and after treatment to assess remineralization. RESULTS: The NaF group showed a significant increase in SMH (45%) and CSMH (35%) compared to the control group. The GSE group demonstrated a similar trend with a 40% increase in SMH and a 30% increase in CSMH. Both treatments were significantly more effective than the control (P < 0.05), with no significant difference between the NaF and GSE groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Grape seed extract exhibits comparable remineralizing efficacy to sodium fluoride on both surface and subsurface enamel lesions in vitro. These findings suggest that GSE could be a viable natural alternative to fluoride for the prevention and treatment of dental caries."

      "abstract": "Depression is a neuropsychiatric disorder that affects thousands of people around the world. Drug therapy is the main approach for treating this disease, but its use can cause side effects on cells. This study aimed to examine the impact of antidepressant drugs from different classes on glial (BV-2) cells in the presence or absence of grape seed extract (GSE) and quinolinic acid (QA; 1.5 mM). Cells were treated with GSE (50 μg/mL; 23 h) and then exposed to non-cytotoxic concentrations of bupropion, imipramine, paroxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine (27-181 µM; 1 h). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to demonstrate the best combination of drug and extract treatment. Cell viability, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) levels, oxidative damage to lipids (TBARS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, apoptosis, and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) genetic expression were evaluated by spectrophotometry, qRT-PCR, or flow cytometry. Mitochondrial markers (CI: NADH-CoQ reductase and CIV: cytochrome c oxidase) were also studied. GSE prevented the increment in levels of ROS (13.73-72.11%), TBARS (44.1-92.77%), NO (9.5-16%), SOD (68.44-212.29%) activity, and apoptosis (10.06-17.3%) caused by antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, it prevented impairments in complexes I (22-71.5%) and IV (7.5-92.5%) activities and ATP production (8-46%). GSE also prevented the NLRP3 overexpression in BV-2 activated by QA (62%), and paroxetine (46%), defined by PCA. Our study evidences that GSE can restore redox equilibrium and prevent inflammation caused by antidepressants and/or QA in a glial microenvironment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting the urinary tract that occurs mainly in men over 40 years of age. Among the natural therapies, proanthocyanidins (PACs), which can treat a wide range of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), have been shown to play an important role in the treatment of pathologies concerning prostate health. In this regard, the present study aimed to evaluate the different bioactivities of a grape seed extract (GSE), rich in polymeric PACs, and its version processed under alkaline conditions (ATGSE), characterized by a higher content of oligomeric PACs, in an animal model of BPH induced by subcutaneous injection of testosterone (1 mg/mouse). METHODS: These latter were divided into a control group (vehicle, olive oil), a BPH group (testosterone 1 mg/mouse), and four treatment groups treated with GSE (500 mg/kg) and ATGSE (125, 250, 500 mg/kg) by oral gavage. At the experimental endpoint (4 weeks), hematological and biochemical analyses of blood and tissues were performed. RESULTS: Data showed that oral administration of ATGSE (250 mg/kg) was significantly more effective than GSE in reducing prostate (p ≤ 0.0001) and seminal vesicle (p ≤ 0.0001) weight. Moreover, ATGSE exhibited enhanced effectiveness in significantly reducing PSA levels (p ≤ 0.0001 vs. GSE) and the expression of key pro-inflammatory cyto-chemokines in prostate and seminal vesicles homogenates. CONCLUSIONS: These findings pave the way for the clinical application of ATGSE as a nutraceutical and/or functional food.",

This study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of grape seed extract (GSE) and L-Carnitine (L-CA) against DOX-induced cardiac toxicity in male rats. Six groups of male albino rats were used: G1 (control); G2 (GSE), given grape seed extract (100 mg/kg b.wt.) orally for 35 days; G3 (L-CA) (150 mg/kg b.wt.); Group 4 (DOX-induced cardiotoxicity), given DOX (10 mg/kg b.wt., i.p.) on the 28th day of the experiment; G5 (GSE + DOX), given GSE and DOX as previously mentioned; and G6 (L-CA + DOX), given L-CA and DOX as previously mentioned. Electrocardiographic evaluation, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation and antioxidants, serum cardiac markers, and inflammatory markers were estimated. Histopathological evaluation of cardiac tissue was also examined. Key findings showed that DOX induced ECG abnormalities lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidants, and elevated cardiac and inflammatory markers. GSE and L-CA significantly ameliorated ECG abnormalities, reduced lipid peroxidation, improved antioxidant enzymes and serum cardiac markers, and reduced inflammation. These findings suggest that GSE and L-CA exhibit substantial cardioprotective effects in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity via their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials."

Cellulose-GSE hydrogels were elaborated with varying GSE contents from 10 to 50 wt%. The mechanical and physical properties, antimicrobial effect, biocompatibility, and in vitro cytotoxicity were studied. In all the cases, the presence of GSE affects the hydrogel's mechanical properties. The elongation decreased from 12.67 mm for the hydrogel without GSE to 6.33 mm for the hydrogel with the highest GSE content. The tensile strength decrease was from 52.33 N/mm2 (for the samples without GSE) and went to 40 N/mm2 for the highest GSE content. Despite the adverse effects, hydrogels possess suitable properties for manipulation. In addition, all hydrogels exhibited excellent biocompatibility and no cytotoxicity, and the antibacterial performance was demonstrated against S. mutans, E. Faecalis, S. aureus, and P. aureginosa. Furthermore, the hydrogels with 30 wt% GSE inhibited more than 90% of the bacterial growth."

      "abstract": "The study aimed to explore the antimicrobial efficacy of grape seed extract (GSE) and cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) individually or in combination against L. monocytogenes and E. coli wild type (WT) and their isogenic mutants in environmental stress genes. More specifically, we examined the effects of 1% (wt/vol) GSE, 4 min of CAP treatment, and their combined effect on L. monocytogenes 10403S WT and its isogenic mutants ΔsigB, ΔgadD1, ΔgadD2, ΔgadD3, as well as E. coli K12 and its isogenic mutants ΔrpoS, ΔoxyR, and ΔdnaK. In addition, the sequence of the combined treatments was tested. A synergistic effect was achieved for all L. monocytogenes strains when exposure to GSE was followed by CAP treatment. However, the same effect was observed against E. coli strains, only for the reversed treatment sequence. Additionally, L. monocytogenes ΔsigB was more sensitive to the individual GSE and the combined GSE/CAP treatment, whereas ΔgadD2 was more sensitive to CAP, as compared to the rest of the mutants under study. Individual GSE exposure was unable to inhibit E. coli strains, and individual CAP treatment resulted in higher inactivation of E. coli in comparison to L. monocytogenes with the strain ΔrpoS appearing the most sensitive among all studied strains. Our findings provide a step toward a better understanding of the mechanisms playing a role in the tolerance/sensitivity of our model Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria toward GSE, CAP, and their combination. Therefore, our results contribute to the development of more effective and targeted antimicrobial strategies for sustainable decontamination.IMPORTANCEAlternative approaches to conventional sterilization are gaining interest from the food industry, driven by (i) the consumer demand for minimally processed products and (ii) the need for sustainable, environmentally friendly processing interventions. However, as such alternative approaches are milder than conventional heat sterilization, bacterial pathogens might not be entirely killed by them, which means that they could survive and grow, causing food contamination and health hazards. In this manuscript, we performed a systematic study of the impact of antimicrobials derived from fruit industry waste (grape seed extract) and cold atmospheric plasma on the inactivation/killing as well as the damage of bacterial pathogens and their genetically modified counterparts, for genes linked to the response to environmental stress. Our work provides insights into genes that could be responsible for the bacterial capability to resist/survive those novel treatments, therefore, contributing to the development of more effective and targeted antimicrobial strategies for sustainable decontamination.",

      "abstract": "Salinity stress poses a significant threat to crop productivity worldwide, necessitating effective mitigation strategies. This study investigated the phytochemical composition and potential of grape seed extract (GSE) to mitigate salinity stress effects on faba bean plants. GC-MS analysis revealed several bioactive components in GSE, predominantly fatty acids. GSE was rich in essential nutrients and possessed a high antioxidant capacity. After 14 days of germination, GSE was applied as a foliar spray at different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 g/L) to mitigate the negative effects of salt stress (150 mM NaCl) on faba bean plants. Foliar application of 2-8 g/L GSE significantly enhanced growth parameters such as shoot length, root length, fresh weight, and dry weight of salt-stressed bean plants compared to the control. The Fv/Fm ratio, indicating photosynthetic activity, also improved with GSE treatment under salinity stress compared to the control. GSE effectively alleviated the oxidative stress induced by salinity, reducing malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, praline, and glycine betaine levels. Total soluble proteins, amino acids, and sugars were enhanced in GSE-treated, salt-stressed plants. GSE treatment under salinity stress modulated the total antioxidant capacity, antioxidant responses, and enzyme activities such as peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase compared to salt-stressed plants. Gene expression analysis revealed GSE (6 g/L) upregulated photosynthesis (chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of LHCII type 1-like (Lhcb1) and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain-like (RbcL)) and carbohydrate metabolism (cell wall invertase I (CWINV1) genes) while downregulating stress response genes (ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) and ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1 (ERF1)) in salt-stressed bean plants. The study demonstrates GSE's usefulness in mitigating salinity stress effects on bean plants by modulating growth, physiology, and gene expression patterns, highlighting its potential as a natural approach to enhance salt tolerance."

These SVDs were prepared by dispersion in water at low concentrations of mucoadhesive polymers to which SLN pellets were added. For the purpose, we investigated two polymeric blends, namely Poloxamer/Carbopol (PF-127/Carb) and oxidized alginate/Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (AlgOX/HPMC). Rheological studies showed that the two fluids possess Newtonian behaviour with a viscosity slightly higher that water. The pH values of the SVDs were mainly within the normal range of nasal fluid as well as almost no osmotic effect was associated to both SVDs. All the SVDs were capable to provide DA permeation through nasal porcine mucosa. Moreover, it was found that PF-127/Carb blend possesses penetration enhancer capability better than the Alg OX/HPMC combination. Flow cytometry studies demonstrated the uptake of viscous liquids incorporating fluorescent SLNs by human nasal RPMI 2650 cell in time-dependent manner. In conclusion, the SVD formulations may be considered promising alternatives to thermosensitive hydrogels strategy. Moreover, in a broader perspective, such SVD formulations may be also hopeful for treating various neurological diseases beyond PD treatment.",

METHODS: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial study, 50 NAFLD patients were divided into two groups of 25 participants who were treated with 520 mg/day of GSE or the placebo group for 2 months. The parameters of glycemic, lipid profile, blood pressure and steatohepatitis were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The GSE group had an average age of 43.52 ± 8.12 years with 15 women and 10 men, while the placebo group had an average age of 44.88 ± 10.14 years with 11 women and 14 men. After 2 months of intervention with GSE, it was observed that insulin, HOMA-IR, TC, TG, LDL-c, ALT, AST, AST/ALT, SBP, DBP and MAP decreased and QUICKi and HDL-c increased significantly (p-value for all < 0.05). Also, before and after adjustment based on baseline, the average changes indicated that the levels of insulin, HOMA-IR, TC, TG, LDL-c, SBP, DBP, MAP in the GSE group decreased more than in the control group (p for all < 0.05). Furthermore, the changes in HDL-c were significantly higher in the GSE group (p < 0.05). The between-groups analysis showed a significant decrease in the HOMA-β and AST before and after adjustment based on baseline levels (p < 0.05). Moreover, the changes in QUICKi after adjustment based on baseline levels were higher in the GSE group than in the control group. Also, between-groups analysis showed that the severity of hepatic steatosis was reduced in the intervention group compared to the placebo group (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: It seems that GSE can be considered one of the appropriate strategies for controlling insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The clinical trial was registered in the Iranian Clinical Trial Registration Center (IRCT20190731044392N1). https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir/trial/61413 .

Current treatment focuses on compensating for dopamine (DA) deficiency, but the blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses challenges for effective drug delivery. Using differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, we investigated the co-administration of DA and the antioxidant Grape Seed Extract (GSE) to study the cytobiocompability, the cytoprotection against the neurotoxin Rotenone, and their antioxidant effects. For this purpose, two solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) formulations, DA-co-GSE-SLNs and GSE-ads-DA-SLNs, were synthesized. Such SLNs showed mean particle sizes in the range of 187-297 nm, zeta potential values in the range of -4.1--9.7 mV, and DA association efficiencies ranging from 35 to 82%, according to the formulation examined. The results showed that DA/GSE-SLNs did not alter cell viability and had a cytoprotective effect against Rotenone-induced toxicity and oxidative stress. In addition, this study also focused on the evaluation of Alpha-synuclein (aS) levels; SLNs showed the potential to modulate the Rotenone-mediated increase in aS levels. In conclusion, our study investigated the potential of SLNs as a delivery system for addressing PD, also representing a promising approach for enhanced delivery of pharmaceutical and antioxidant molecules across the BBB.",

In this study, we investigated the protective effect of grape seed extract (GSE) against CPF-induced hepatotoxicity. Rats were daily treated either with CPF (2 mg/kg) or CPF and GSE (20 mg/kg) for 1 week, sacrificed, and their livers dissected for biochemical, molecular, and histopathological analyses. CPF generated liver dysfunction by altering carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, ammonia and urea metabolism, and provoked mitochondrial impairment through disturbing tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and mitochondrial viability. CPF also induced cholinergic excitotoxicity along with oxidative stress and histopathological alterations. Interestingly, treatment with GSE prevented all the detrimental effects of CPF through the regulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) gene expression. Molecular docking analysis indicated that GSE-containing polyphenols acted as epigenetic modulators through inhibiting DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), thus favoring the CYP2C6 detoxification pathway. Thereby, GSE might be a promising strategy in the protection of the liver against CPF toxicity.",

Silver nanoparticles are widely used in biomedical devices due to their antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. The study evaluates the efficacy of blue laser and silver nanoparticles from grape seed extract (AgNPs-GSE) in reducing gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria causing infections. Methods: The sample consisted of four groups: a control without laser irradiation (T0), E. coli samples (A1 and A2) irradiated with a 405 nm diode laser at different times and concentrations of silver nanoparticles, and S. aureus samples (A3 and A4) irradiated with a 405 nm diode laser at different times and concentrations. Bacteria in groups A2 and A4 were treated with a photosensitizer (PS) made from grape seed extracts, incubated for 10 minutes, and then irradiated for 90, 120, 150, and 180 seconds. The samples were cultured on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) media, incubated at 37 °C, counted by using a Quebec colony counter, and analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey tests with a significance level of P<0.05. Results: The study found that 10 µl of AgNPs-GSE, when combined with exposure to a blue laser at 405 nm and a dose of 3.44 J/cm2, can effectively photoinactivate E. coli and S. aureus bacteria. The addition of AgNPs-GSE to E. coli bacteria led to a significant reduction in their viability, with a reduction of 73.93%, 80.96%, and 83.80%, respectively. Similarly, when S. aureus bacteria were irradiated for 180 seconds by adding 1 mM, 1.5 mM, and 2 mM AgNPs-GSE, bacterial viability was reduced by 70.87%, 78.04%, and 87.01%, respectively. Conclusion: The findings from the present study indicate that at an energy density of 3.44 J/cm2, it was possible to inactivate E. coli by 83.80% and S. aureus by 87.01%."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Enamel surface of hundred and twenty sound human first premolar teeth was cleansed using pumice and bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide. The samples were randomly divided into 5 groups based on the antioxidants used. n = 20 Group 1 (Control): No antioxidant agent, Group 2: 10 % SA solution, Group 3: 6.5 % GSE, Group 4: 5 % GTE, Group 5: Er: YAG laser and Group 6: CP. Following reversal, the composite was built and cured for 40 s. All the specimens were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 1 day. Microleakage, SBS, and failure mode were analyzed. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey's multiple post hoc test were used to analyze the data statistically. RESULTS: Group 2 (SA) (20.11 ± 5.79 nm) exhibited minimum value of microleakage and highest SBS (10.22 ± 1.62 MPa). Whereas, Group 1 (No antioxidant agent) displayed maximum scores of marginal leakage (28.11±8.89 nm) and lowest SBS (7.02 ± 1.22 MPa). CONCLUSION: CP, GTE and GSE can be used as a potential alternative to the commonly used SA solution to reverse the negative impact of bleaching on the enamel surface. The use of reversal agents CP, GTE and GSE improves bond values with a decrease in microleakage scores However, future studies are still warranted to conclude the outcomes of the existing study.",

To develop powders constituted by such SLNs for nasal administration, herein, two different agents, namely sucrose and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Me-β-CD), were evaluated as cryoprotectants. (2) Methods: SLNs were prepared following the melt homogenization method, and their physicochemical features were investigated by Raman spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). (3) Results: SLN size and zeta potential values changed according to the type of cryoprotectant and the morphological features investigated by SEM showed that the SLN samples after lyophilization appear as folded sheets with rough surfaces. On the other hand, the AFM visualization of the SLNs showed that their morphology consists of round-shaped particles before and after freeze-drying. XPS showed that when sucrose or Me-β-CD were not detected on the surface (because they were not allocated on the surface or completely absent in the formulation), then a DA surfacing was observed. In vitro release studies in Simulated Nasal Fluid evidenced that DA release, but not the GSE one, occurred from all the cryoprotected formulations. Finally, sucrose increased the physical stability of SLNs better than Me-β-CD, whereas RPMI 2650 cell viability was unaffected by SLN-sucrose and slightly reduced by SLN-Me-β-CD. (4) Conclusions: Sucrose can be considered a promising excipient, eliciting cryoprotection of the investigated SLNs, leading to a powder nasal pharmaceutical dosage form suitable to be handled by PD patients.",

In the present study, the protective effect of procyanidin-rich grape seed extract (prGSE), from unfermented pomace of Vitis vinifera L. cv Bellone, on bacterial LPS-induced oxidative stress and epithelial barrier integrity damage has been studied in a model of Caco-2 cells. The prGSE was characterized at the molecular level using HPLC and NMR. The in vitro activity of prGSE against formation of biofilm of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli was investigated. In vivo, prGSE activity using infected Galleria mellonella larvae has been evaluated. The results show that the prGSE, if administered with LPS, can significantly reduce the LPS-induced permeability alteration. Moreover, the ability of the extract to prevent Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production induced by the LPS treatment of Caco-2 cells was demonstrated. prGSE inhibited the biofilm formation of E. coli and S. Typhimurium. In terms of in vivo activity, an increase in survival of infected G. mellonella larvae after treatment with prGSE was demonstrated. In conclusion, grape seed extracts could be used to reduce GI damage caused by bacterial endotoxin and biofilms of Gram-negative bacteria."

In this study, screening of natural extracts with anti- NoV effects was performed using these two methods. Of the 63 natural extracts examined, 14 were found to have high FCV-inactivation and NoV-VLP-binding inhibitory effects. In addition, we evaluated the NoV-VLPbinding inhibitory effect of grape seed extract（GSE）containing proanthocyanidins under multiple concentration conditions and treatment times and determined that the binding inhibitory effect of GSE was concentration- and time-dependent. Electron microscopy showed that GSE-treated NoV-VLPs aggregated, distorted, and swelled, suggesting that GSE directly interacts with NoV particles. The results suggest that some natural extracts containing GSE can be used as components of disinfectants against NoV.",

This study aimed to investigate the iron-chelating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective activities of grape seed extract (GSE) supplement as well as its safety in β-thalassemia major (β-TM) pediatric patients receiving deferasirox as a standard iron-chelation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The children were randomly allocated to either GSE group (n = 30) or control group (n = 30) to receive GSE (100 mg/day) or placebo capsules, respectively, for 4 weeks. The serum levels of iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration were measured pre-and post-intervention. RESULTS: GSE supplement significantly attenuated the serum levels of iron (p = 0.030), ferritin (p = 0.017), ALT (p = 0.000), AST (p = 0.000), TNF-α (p = 0.000), and hs-CRP (p = 0.001). The TIBC level (p = 0.020) significantly enhanced in the GSE group compared with the placebo group. Moreover, GSE supplement remarkably improved the oxidative stress markers, MDA (p = 0.000) and GSH (p = 0.001). The changes in the SOD activity (p = 0.590) and Hb concentration (p = 0.670) were not statistically different between the groups. CONCLUSION: GSE supplement possesses several health beneficial influences on children with β-TM by alleviating iron burden, oxidative stress, inflammation, and liver dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop an oral succinyl chitosan-coated liposomal formulation containing grape seed extract and assess its therapeutic efficacy in rats with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: N-succinyl chitosan was synthesized, and the liposomal formulations were prepared and characterized regarding phenolic content assay and morphology. Size, zeta potential, in vitro drug release, and stability. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intratracheal bleomycin injection, and hydroxyproline measurements, lung weight, animal body weight, as well as histopathological studies were performed. RESULTS: Succinyl chitosan increases the physical stability of the formulation, especially in acidic conditions. Drug release studies revealed that 66.27% of the loaded drug was released from CF2 in an acidic medium in 2 hr, but 92.31% of the drug was released in 8 hr in a pH=7 medium. An in vivo study demonstrated that rats exposed to bleomycin significantly lost weight, while those treated with CF2 (400 mg/kg) partially regained weight. Bleomycin treatment increased the mean lung weight and the amount of hydroxyproline in the lungs; these values were significantly decreased in the group treated with 400 mg/kg CF2 (P<0.05). Histopathological examination confirmed that treatment with 400 mg/kg CF2 improved lung fibrosis. CONCLUSION: In rats, oral administration of N-succinyl chitosan-coated liposomes containing grape seed extract at the 400 mg/kg dose ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

METHODS: Thirty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups and daily treated by intraperitoneal route during two months either with ethanol 10% (Control); Doxo (1.5 mg/kg); Doxo + exercise (1.5 mg/kg + swimming exercise for 30 min twice a week); Doxo + GSE (1.5 mg/kg + GSE 2.5 g/kg); Doxo + GSE + exercise (1.5 mg/kg + GSE 2.5 g/kg + swimming exercise for 30 min twice a week). At the end of the treatment, tissues were collected and processed for the determination of oxidative stress (OS), intracellular mediators, energy fuelling biomarkers, carbohydrate metabolism parameters and muscle histopathology. RESULTS: Doxo provoked OS characterised by an increased lipoperoxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities. Doxo also affected intracellular mediators, disturbed carbohydrate metabolism and energy fuelling in skeletal muscle as assessed by down-regulated Electron Transport Chain (ETC) complex activities leading in fine to altered skeletal muscle structure and function. CONCLUSION: Almost all Doxo-induced disturbances were partially corrected with GSE and exercise on their own and more efficiently with the combined treatment (GSE + exercise).",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs), low-level laser therapy (LLLT), and grape-seed extract (GSE) on condylar growth after functional mandibular advancement. METHODS: Forty-five rats were randomly divided into 8 groups. Functional appliances were applied to all groups (n=6) except the control group (n=3). One group was treated with appliances only; the other six groups received various combinations of ADMSCs, LLLT, and GSE. Analyses for new osteoblasts and new bone formation, vascular endothelial growth factor, and Type II collagen were performed on condylar tissues, after an experimental period of four weeks. The quantitative data obtained from the results of the experiments were evaluated by H-score and analyzed using One-Way ANOVA by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test (p≤0.05). RESULTS: Levels of all investigated parameters increased in all groups (p≤0.05). The highest increases were achieved by a combined application of functional appliance, ADMSCs, LLLT and GSE (p≤0.05). Single LLLT administrations or single GSE applications did not create a statistical difference from appliance alone (p>0.05). A positive effect of ADMSCs or LLLT on osteoblast formation, neovascularization, and Type II collagen level was apparent (p≤0.05), however, neither affected new bone formation (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: This study shows that ADMSCs with LLLT and GSE applications provide differing levels of new osteoblast and bone formation, new vascular formation, and Type II collagen formation in rat condyles after functional mandibular advancement."

      "abstract": "The increase in life expectancy has led to a higher incidence of osteoporosis, characterized by an imbalance in bone remodeling. Several drugs are used for its treatment, but most promote undesirable side effects. The present investigation evaluated the effects of two low concentrations of grape seed extract (GSE) rich in proanthocyanidins on MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. The cells were cultured in an osteogenic medium and divided into control (C), 0.1 µg/mL GSE (GSE0.1), and 1.0 µg/mL GSE (GSE1.0) groups to evaluate cell morphology, adhesion, and proliferation, in situ alkaline phosphatase (ALP) detection, mineralization and immunolocalization of osteopontin (OPN). The data obtained were analyzed by statistical tests for a significance of 5%. Cell morphology was maintained with both GSE concentrations, whereas cell adhesion significantly increased within three days in all groups. Cell proliferation increased significantly at seven days of culture, followed by a significant decrease in all experimental periods, with no statistical difference among them. In situ detection of ALP and mineralization increased with time, but within each period, no statistical differences among groups were observed. The expression of osteopontin was distributed regularly with more intensity after 24 hours in the GSE0.1 group. After three days, OPN expression was more intense in the control group, followed by GSE0.1 and GSE1.0 groups. Data obtained suggest that low concentrations of GSE do not affect the morphology and may stimulate the functional activity of osteoblastic cells.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 20 intact bovine incisor crowns were separated from their roots and immersed in a demineralizing solution for 96 hours at 37°C to create artificial enamel lesions. The specimens were randomly divided into two groups (n = 10): 6.5% GSE solution and 1000 ppm NaF solution. The specimens were subjected to six daily pH cycles for 8 days. The microhardness test was carried out at three different stages: baseline, after artificial caries formation, and after pH cycling. Raman spectroscopy was used to evaluate the depth of enamel remineralization. Surface morphology and elemental analysis were assessed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscope, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the mean values of enamel surface microhardness after pH cycles in the two groups compared to after artificial caries formation, but there was no significant difference between both groups. The B-type carbonate/phosphate (Ca/P) ratio at 10 and 40 µm depth revealed no significant difference between the two groups. Scanning electron microscope micrograph revealed occlusion of porosities and particle precipitation on the enamel surface of the two groups, while EDX results for the Ca/P ratio of the GSE and NaF groups were 1.59 and 1.60, respectively. CONCLUSION: Grape seed extract and NaF are equally effective in remineralizing surface and subsurface artificial enamel lesions. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Grape seed extract can be considered a promising herbal material and a safe alternative to traditional NaF for the noninvasive treatment of enamel lesions.",

Grape seed extract (GSE) is a natural antimicrobial with potential for reducing Listeria monocytogenes contamination in food. This study assessed the effectiveness of GSE to reduce L. monocytogenes on fresh produce and the impact of food matrices on its antilisterial activity. GSE showed MIC values of 30-35 μg/mL against four Listeria strains used in this study. A total of 100 g portions of cantaloupe, apples, and celery were inoculated with L. monocytogenes and treated with 100-1000 μg/mL of GSE for 5 or 15 min. Results were analyzed using Rstudio and a Tukey's test. Treated produce had significantly lower L. monocytogenes counts than the control samples (p-value < 0.05). The inhibition was significantly higher on apples and lowest on cantaloupe. Moreover, a 15 min treatment was found to be more effective than a 5 min treatment in reducing L. monocytogenes on all produce types. The reduction in L. monocytogenes levels varied between 0.61 and 2.5 log10 CFU reduction, depending on the treatment concentration, duration, and produce matrix. These findings suggest that GSE is an effective antilisterial treatment for fresh produce, with varying levels of effectiveness depending on the food matrix and treatment time."

This study aimed to determine whether red grape seed extract (RGSE, which is 95% bioflavonoids and equal to 12,000 mg of fresh red grape seed, and 150 mg of vitamin C) alleviated the changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level, acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis induced by orally administered malathion in a rat model of malathion-induced neurotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups and exposed to malathion with or without 4 weeks of RGSE treatment, treated with RGSE alone, or left untreated as controls. The animals were euthanized 24 h after last treatment. Brain samples were collected to measure acetylcholinesterase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and caspase 3 activity, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and BDNF levels. RESULTS: Malathion significantly reduced acetylcholinesterase and SOD activity and TAC and significantly increased caspase 3 activity. In comparison, acetylcholinesterase and SOC activity, BDNF level, and TAC were improved and caspase 3 activity was decreased in the malathion-RGSE group, indicating that RGSE corrected the alterations detected in these biochemical parameters. CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress and apoptosis in the brains of rats exposed to oral malathion were substantially controlled by RGSE treatment."

In fact, GSE supply would reduce the PD-related oxidative stress in a synergic effect with DA. Herein, two different methods of DA/GSE loading were studied, namely, coadministration in the aqueous phase of DA and GSE, and the other approach consisting of a physical adsorption of GSE onto preformed DA containing SLNs. Mean diameter of DA coencapsulating GSE SLNs was 187 ± 4 nm vs. 287 ± 15 nm of GSE adsorbing DA-SLNs. TEM microphotographs evidenced low-contrast spheroidal particles, irrespective of the SLN type. Moreover, Franz diffusion cell experiments confirmed the permeation of DA from both SLNs through the porcine nasal mucosa. Furthermore, fluorescent SLNs also underwent cell-uptake studies by using flow cytometry in olfactory ensheathing cells and neuronal SH-SY5Y cells, evidencing higher uptake when GSE was coencapsulated rather than adsorbed onto the particles."

The imbalance of the vaginal microbiota plays a key role in the development of BV. It has been demonstrated that Gardnerella vaginalis (GV), a facultative anaerobic bacillus, is involved in BV. Due to the rising number of antimicrobial-resistant species, recurrence of BV is becoming more frequent in women; thus, alternative treatments to antibiotics are needed. Natural substances have recently shown a great efficacy for the treatment of vaginal dysbiosis. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the beneficial effect of a product containing pea protein (PP), grape seed extract (GS) and lactic acid (LA) in an in vivo model of Gardnerella vaginalis-induced vaginosis by intravaginal administration of GV suspension (1 × 106 CFU/20 µL saline). Our results demonstrated that the product containing PP, GS and LA significantly reduced GV proliferation. More specifically, it significantly preserved tissue architecture and reduced neutrophil infiltration, inflammatory markers and sialidase activity when used both as a pre- or a post-treatment. Moreover, the product displayed strong bioadhesive properties. Therefore, our data suggested that the product containing PP, GS and LA could be used as alternative preventive or curative treatment for the management of BV.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Grape Seed Extract is a natural source of various polyphenols, which have been shown to possess potent antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities. The earlier studies have reported that grape seed extract exhibits broad-spectrum pharmacological activities. Therefore, studying the hepatoprotective effects and elucidation of mechanisms of action of the Indian Variety, Manjari Medika grape seed extract (GSE), may give an insight into therapeutic benefits. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line pharmacological therapy for different rheumatic diseases. The major adverse events such as hepatotoxicity are evident even in the low doses used for the treatment. The present study investigated the role of MTX on hepatic damage in murine liver and the plausible protective effects of the Indian grape variety, Manjari Medika grape seed extract, in ameliorating it. METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess the hepatological modulation, mice were divided into eight groups to investigate the ameliorative potential of this GSE (75 and 125 mg/kg) and correlate the experimental findings. The active components of the extract were assessed through UPLC-(ESI)-QToF-MS analysis. On the other hand, various biochemical and immunological indices were carried out to correlate the experimental data. The result demonstrated that the prophylactic administration of GSE reduced MTX-induced hepatic toxicity indices, which subsequently restored the hepatic morphological architecture. Moreover, the application of GSE in a dual dosage (75 and 125 mg/kg) suppressed MTX-induced reactive oxygen species generation, followed by lipid peroxidation and cellular nitrite formation. MTX-induced inflammasome activation through the redox-assisted cascade of TLR4/NF-κB signaling was further reduced by applying the GSE. The results showed that the activation of cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 enhanced the level of endogenous antioxidants. Furthermore, through the regulation of TLR4/NF-κB and Nrf2/HO-1 axis, this extract could reduce the MTX-mediated hepatic damage. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Manjari Medika seed extract could be used as a therapeutic agent to relieve the side effects of MTX and other hepatic disorders."

METHODS: This study determined the inhibitory effect of GSE on macrophage inflammation and Th1 and Th17 polarization in vitro. Based on the in vitro results, the effects and mechanisms of GSE on multiple sclerosis (MS)-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice model were further explored. The C57BL/6 mice were intragastrically administered with 50 mg/kg of GSE once a day from the 3rd day to the 27th day after immunization. The activation of microglia, the polarization of Th1 and Th17 and the inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α), interleukin-1 β (IL-1 β), IL-6, IL-12, IL-17 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secreted by them were detected in vitro and in vivo by flow cytometry, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence staining and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: GSE reduced the secretion of TNF-α, IL-1 β and IL-6 in bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (P<0.01), inhibited the secretion of TNF-α, IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17 and IFN-γ in spleen cells of EAE mice immunized for 9 days (P<0.05 or P<0.01), and reduced the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 mediated by CD3 and CD28 factors (P<0.01). GSE significantly improved the clinical symptoms of EAE mice, and inhibited spinal cord demyelination and inflammatory cell infiltration. Peripherally, GSE downregulated the expression of toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) and Rho-associated kinase (ROCKII, P<0.05 or P<0.01), and inhibited the secretion of inflammatory factors (P<0.01 or P<0.05). In the central nervous system, GSE inhibited the infiltration of CD45+CD11b+ and CD45+CD4+ cells, and weakened the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 (P<0.05). Moreover, it reduced the secretion of inflammatory factors (P<0.01), and prevented the activation of microglia (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: GSE had a beneficial effect on the pathogenesis and progression of EAE by inhibiting inflammatory response as a potential drug and strategy for the treatment of MS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is considered the second most common vaginal infection. Up to 8% of women in various populations experience more than three or four episodes within one year, which is regarded as recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). Current therapies involve antifungal drugs that provide static effects but do not prevent recurrences due to increased antimicrobial resistance; thus, alternative therapies to antifungals are needed to prevent RVVC. METHODS: A murine model of Candida albicans-induced RVVC was performed to evaluate the efficacy of a topical product containing pea protein (PP), grape seed extract (GS), and lactic acid (LA) to treat recurrent infections. Mice were inoculated with three separate vulvovaginal infections of 5 × 104 cells/mL C. albicans, and histological evaluation, a myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay. and an ELISA kit for Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on vaginal tissues were performed. RESULTS: The data obtained highlighted that the combination of PP, GS, and LA significantly preserved vaginal tissue architecture and prevented vaginal inflammation, proving its efficacy for the management of RVVC. Moreover, the combination of PP, GS, and LA notably increased azole efficacy by adding a new mechanism of action when administered concomitantly. CONCLUSION: Taken together, results demonstrated that the treatment with a combination of PP, GS, and LA is able to reduce the adhesion of C. albicans."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nowadays, diabetes mellitus is known as a silent killer because individual is not aware that he has the disease till the development of its complications. Many researchers have studied the use of stem cells in treatment of both types of diabetes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold a lot of potential for regenerative therapy. MSCs migrate and home at the damaged site, where they can aid in the repair of damaged tissues and restoring their function. Oxidative stress and inflammation represent a huge obstacle during MSCs transplantation. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the role of grape seed extract (GSE) administration during MSCs transplantation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type I diabetes. Furthermore, testing some of GSE components [procyanidins(P)-B1 and P-C1] in conjunction with MSCs, in vivo, was performed to determine if one of them was more effective in relieving the measured attributes of diabetes more than the whole GSE. METHODS: Firstly, GSE was prepared from the seeds of Muscat of Alexandria grapes and characterized to identify its phytochemical components. Experimental design was composed of control group I, untreated diabetic group II, GSE (300 mg/kg)-treated diabetic group III, MSCs (2 × 106 cells/rat)-treated diabetic group IV and GSE (300 mg/kg)/MSCs (2 × 106 cells/rat)-treated diabetic group V. Type I diabetes was induced in rats by intravenous injection with 65 mg/kg of STZ. Treatment started when fasting blood glucose (FBG) level was more than 200 mg/dl; GSE oral administration started in the same day after MSCs intravenous injection and continued daily for 30 consecutive days. RESULTS: The results showed that GSE/MSCs therapy in type I-induced diabetic rats has dramatically managed homeostasis of glucose and insulin secretion; together with, improvement in levels of inflammatory markers and oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: Co-treatment with GSE and MSCs in vivo regenerates beta cells in type I-induced diabetic rats.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the multiple toxic effects of potassium bromate were investigated in Allium cepa L., an indicator test material. In addition, the toxicity-reducing effects of grape seed extract (GSE) were tested. The toxicity was investigated by some physiological (germination percentage, root length, weight gain, relative injury rate), cytogenetic [mitotic index (MI), micronucleus (MN), and chromosomal abnormalities (CAs)], biochemical [malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) levels] and anatomical parameters. A. cepa bulbs were divided into 6 groups as control and five treatment groups (Group II: 465 mg/L GSE, Group III: 930 mg/L GSE, Group IV: 100 mg/L potassium bromate, Group V: 100 mg/L potassium bromate + 465 mg/L GSE, Group VI: 100 mg /L potassium bromate + 930 mg/L GSE). The bulbs were germinated for 72 h and at the end of the period the bulbs were subjected to routine preparations and made ready for analysis and measurements. As a result, potassium bromate exposure caused statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases in all physiological parameter values. Potassium bromate application decreased MI by 41.6%, and increased the MN and CAs frequencies. CAs such as fragment, sticky chromosome, and vagrant chromosome, unequal distribution of chromatin, reverse polarization, nuclear bud and disordered mitosis were induced in root meristem cells. The mechanism of potassium bromate genotoxicity has been associated with DNA-potassium bromate interaction supported by spectral shift. Potassium bromate caused a decrease in GSH levels and an increase in MDA, SOD and CAT levels, thereby disrupting the antioxidant/oxidant balance in root tip cells. GSE administration in two different doses together with potassium bromate reduced the toxic effects and caused improvements in all parameters examined. The most significant reduction in toxicity was in group VI, which received 930 mg/L GSE, and there was an improvement about 18% in MI levels and an improvement about 44% in GSH levels in this group. While GSE application increased physiological parameters and GSH levels, it decreased MDA, SOD, CAT levels, MN and CAs frequencies. As a result, it has been determined that potassium bromate causes multi-directional toxicity at high doses and A. cepa is a very reliable indicator in determining this toxicity. In addition, GSE extract has been found to have a strong role in reducing the toxicity induced by potassium bromate.",

To date, no safe and effective vaccines or therapeutic agents have been approved for treating norovirus infections. Therefore, we aimed to demonstrate the virucidal activity of grape seed extract (GSE), which contains >83% proanthocyanidins, against murine norovirus (MNV), a surrogate for human norovirus. GSE showed virucidal activity against MNV in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Atomic force microscopic analysis showed viral particle aggregates after treatment of MNV with GSE. MNV treated with 50 µg/mL of GSE for 10 min resulted in the absence of pathogenicity in an animal model of infection, indicating that GSE has irreversible virucidal activity against MNV particles. Thus, GSE may aid in the development of treatments for norovirus infections.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a multifactorial autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is characterized by demyelination and chronic inflammation, as well as axonal and neuronal loss. There is no cure for MS, and despite a significant improvement in the therapeutic management of patients during the last 20 years, some symptoms are still resistant to treatment, and the evolution of the disease to progressive form seems still ineluctable. The etiology of MS is complex and still not fully understood. However, inflammation is a major driver of physiopathology and oxidative stress contributes to CNS lesions and promotes existing inflammatory response. Plant polyphenols are endowed with many therapeutic benefits through alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation, thus providing neuroprotection in MS. We presently evaluated the curative effect of grape seed extract (GSE) in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Six-week-old C57Bl/6J females were subjected to the EAE paradigm (using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide fragment (35-55), complete Freund's adjuvant, and pertussis toxin) and then chronically treated with GSE from day 10 to day 30 post-induction. Clinical score and body weight were monitored daily, while evaluation of sensitive, motor, cognitive, and anxiety-related behaviors was performed weekly. Then, the GSE effect was evaluated on whole brain and spinal cord samples through the evaluation of oxidative stress damage, antioxidant capacities, myelin alteration, astroglial and microglial proliferation, and sirtuin expression. KEY RESULTS: Grape seed extract curative chronic treatment corrected the clinical course of EAE, as well as the mechanical hypersensitivity, and avoided the development of EAE mouse thermal cold allodynia. The neuropathological evaluation showed that GSE reduced oxidative stress in the brain and spinal cord by decreasing the lipid and protein oxidation through correction of the three main antioxidant enzyme activities, namely, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as restoring normal myelin protein expression and correcting microglial and astroglial protein overexpression and sirtuin downregulation. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These data strongly support GSE as an effective therapeutic approach in MS treatment.",

It has been shown that the main toxic mechanism of aristolochic acid on the liver and kidney is the induction of ROS-induced oxidative stress damage. To investigate whether proanthocyanidins (GSPE), a natural antioxidant product from grape seed extract, could antagonize AA-I-induced liver injury. Thirty-two SD rats were selected and divided into aristolochic acid exposure group (AA-I), normal control group, GSPE group and GSPE intervention group. The protective effects of GSPE on AA-I liver injury were evaluated by examining the body weight, liver index, liver function and liver pathological sections of rats. The results of body weight, liver index, liver function and liver pathological sections of rats showed that GSPE had antagonistic effects on AA-I-induced liver injury. antioxidant enzyme activity in the GSPE intervention group was significantly higher than that in the aristolochic acid group, apoptotic cells were significantly lower than that in the aristolochic acid group, protein and mRNA expression of PI3K-AKT and BCL-2 were significantly higher than that in the aristolochic acid group, BAX, The protein and mRNA expression of BAX, CASPAES-3, CASPAES-9 were significantly lower than those of the aristolochic acid group. GSPE can antagonize aristolochic acid-induced hepatotoxicity, and its mechanism of action is to antagonize aristolochic acid I-induced liver injury by inhibiting PI3K-AKT pathway-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis.",

Hence, various surface treatments were introduced to overcome this problem. AIM: To assess the effect of nonthermal atmospheric plasma (NTAP), grape seed extract (GSE) and bromelain on the shear bond strength (SBS) of the composite after bleaching and microabrasion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty extracted maxillary anterior teeth were distributed into two groups. Group 1: bleaching and Group 2: Microabrasion and further subdivided into four subgroups (n = 10) based on the form of surface treatment employed. Group A: no surface treatment, Group B: bromelain, Group C: GSE, Group D: NTAP. Composite resin was bonded to the labial surface and placed in artificial saliva for 24 h. SBS testing was done for all the samples. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey's test with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Group 1D revealed the highest bond strength (35.4 Mpa) and Group 1A showed the least bond strength values (15.7 Mpa). Among the bleaching groups, significant difference was observed between all the subgroups except Group 1A and 1B (P = 0.972). In microabrasion group, significant difference was observed between Group 2A and 2D (P = 0.0001), Group 2B and 2D (P = 0.0010), and Group 2C and 2D (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Following bleaching, NTAP application and GSE significantly improved the SBS of composite resin. Application of NTAP to microabraded surfaces increased the bond strength of composite resin."

Here we compare and evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microorganism's CFUs (colony forming units) in plaque samples of Group A, Group B, Group C and severity of periodontal disease on day 0 and 7. METHODS: Forty-five subjects in age range 18-30 years were selected among undergraduate students and randomly divided into Group A: 15, 2% grape seed extract mouthwash (GSE), Group B: 15, 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash (CHX) and Group C: 15, distilled water (control). The supragingival plaque was collected into transport media. Kruskal Wallis test followed by Mann Whitney test was used to compare the mean CFUs (×103) of microorganisms and severity of periodontal disease was compared, by clinical parameters among all groups on day 0 and 7. RESULTS: There was a significant difference concerning mean scores of all clinical parameters (P<0.001) and mean CFUs of microorganisms between 3 study groups (P=0.005) at 7 days post-intervention period. Intragroup comparison, mean scores were significantly reduced on day 7 as compared to day 0 at (P<0.001) in Group A and B, but no significant difference was noted with Group C. CONCLUSION: Intervention with GSE mouthwash showed a positive effect on reducing CFUs in the plaque when compared with the control group. GSE group also showed similar results in reducing CFUs in plaque when compared to CHX group, thereby demonstrating the agent's antimicrobial efficacy, therapeutic effect and its potential usefulness in controlling plaque and periodontal diseases."

Bioadhesive polymeric patches have been realized by combining acacia gum (AG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Prototypes were prepared by considering different AG/PVP ratios and the most suitable in terms of mechanical and bioadhesion properties resulted in the 9.5/1.0 ratio. This patch was loaded with GSE combined with cyclic dextrin (CD) to obtain the molecular dispersion of the active ingredient in the dried formulation. The loaded patch resulted mechanically resistant and able to release GSE by a sustained mechanism reaching concentrations able to stimulate keratinocytes' growth, to exert both antibacterial and antioxidant activities."

      "abstract": "Aluminum phosphide is a well-known hazardous agent used as an agricultural pesticide to protect stored grains from insect damage. However, accidental consumption of a trivial amount of it caused irreversible damage to the human body or even death in acute cases. The present study used taurine and grape seed extract as a natural cardioprotective medicine against aluminum phosphide poisoning by decreasing oxidative stress. The activity of oxidative stress biomarkers (Malondialdehyde, Catalase, Protein carbonyl, and Superoxide dismutase) were evaluated in the cell line model on Human Cardiac Myocyte cells. In the beginning, to clarify the pure impact of aluminum phosphide poison, taurine, and grape seed extract on the human heart cells, their effects on the biomarkers quantity in cell line were measured. Subsequently, the effect of taurine and grape seed extract with various concentrations as a treatment on the oxidative stress biomarkers of the poisoned heart cells were studied. Data analysis reveals that taurine and grape seed extract treatment can successfully diminish the poisoning effect by their antioxidant properties. The oxidative markers values of the poisoned cells were recovered by taurine and grape seed extracts treatment. Taurine (2 g/l) can recover Malondialdehyde, Catalase, Protein carbonyl, and Superoxide dismutase by 56%, 78%, 88%, 78%, when the recovering power of grape seed extract (100 g/l) for the aforementioned enzymes are 56%, 0.71%,74%, 51%, respectively. Therefore, it is clear that the performance of taurine in the recovery of the biomarkers' value is better than grape seed extract.",

The scope of the application was proposed to fall under a health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence. MegaNatural®-BP, a grape seed extract standardised for total phenolics, gallic acid and the catechin and epicatechin content, is sufficiently characterised. The proposed claimed effect, maintenance of normal blood pressure (BP), is a beneficial physiological effect. Among the two human intervention studies provided from which conclusions could be drawn, one showed an effect of MegaNatural®-BP (300 mg/day) on BP in adults with normal and high normal BP when consumed daily for 6 weeks, whereas the second study did not show an effect of MegaNatural®-BP at the same daily dose consumed for 8 weeks in adults with normal and high normal blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension. The evidence provided did not establish a plausible mechanism by which the food could exert the claimed effect in vivo in humans. The evidence provided is insufficient to establish a cause and effect relationship between the consumption of MegaNatural®-BP and maintenance of normal blood pressure."

The present study was a longitudinal, parallel design, randomized clinical trial. Seventy-two patients (mean age 39.2±8.6 years) with periodontal pockets were randomly divided into two groups; Test group received intra-pocket delivery of GSE with SRP and Control group received SRP alone. The clinical parameters like Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), Probing Depth (PD) and Relative Attachment Level (RAL) were recorded at baseline and 3 months. 64 patients completed the study. Test group at the end of 3 months had statistically significant reduced PD (p=0.002) and RAL (p=0.01). No significant difference was observed for PI and GI at the end of 3 months. Intra-pocket application of GSE with SRP could be beneficial in management of periodontal pockets.",

      "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a pathogenic bacteria identified as a potential risk factor for gastritis, gastric ulcers and gastric cancer. During the stomach colonization, H. pylori triggers a strong inflammatory response and subsequent oxidative stress, which are associated with tissue damage. For this reason, it is of particular interest to develop alternative natural tools that enable modulation of the associated damaging immune response. With this purpose, we obtained grape seed extract (GSE) from sweet (not fermented) food grade seeds. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of GSE and its two enriched procyanidins fractions (OPC and PPC) on the inflammatory process and oxidative stress produced by different H. pylori strains in human gastric epithelial cells (AGS). Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by measuring the level of interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. IL-8 production was significantly reduced in H. pylori-infected human gastric epithelial cells pre-treated with GSE or its enriched fractions when compared with non-pre-treated infected cells (from 21.6% to 87.8%). Pre-treatment with GSE or its fractions significantly decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in AGS cells after infection, depending on the H. pylori strain. Our results also showed that GSE and its fractions demonstrate antibacterial activity against all strains of H. pylori used in the study. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of GSE enriched in procyanidins against the main events associated with H. pylori infection."

We reviewed the efficacy of bilberry and grape seed extracts to affect these outcomes across populations with varying health status, age and ethnicity, across intervention doses and durations, in 24 intervention studies with bilberry and blackcurrant (n = 4) and grape seed extract (n = 20). Bilberry and blackcurrant extract lowered average levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), at least in Chinese subjects, especially in those who were older, who were diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and who were participating in longer-term studies. We also found good evidence that across studies and in subjects with hypercholesterolemia, T2DM or metabolic syndrome, intervention with bilberry and blackcurrant extract, and to some extent grape seed extract, significantly lowered total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels after four weeks. Intervention with grape seed extract may reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure in subjects with hypertension or metabolic syndrome. Differential responsiveness in cholesterol and blood pressure outcomes between stratified populations could not be explained by age, dose or study duration. In conclusion, bilberry and blackcurrant extract appears effective in lowering HbA1c and total and LDL cholesterol, whereas grape seed extract may lower total and LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure, in specific population groups.",

It is believed that natural products can protect the neural cells and system by protecting from damages or promoting regeneration. Therefore, the effects of grape seed extract (GSE) on the hippocampus of aged mice were investigated in this study. METHODS: twelve old mice were divided into two groups of control and GSE. Animals in the GSE group received 300 mg/kg of GSE for eight weeks via gavage. At the end of treatment, cognition performance was evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance tests. Hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and DNs production were evaluated with immunohistochemistry and histological evaluations on 5-micron coronal tissue sections. RESULTS: The hippocampal mean number of double cortin positive cells (DCX+) per unit area, as well as synaptophysin expression in the GSE group, were significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.01). The frequency of DNs in the GSE group was lower than the control group (p < 0.05). Behavioral tests showed that GSE improves memory and learning performance. CONCLUSION: Consuming GSE in the elderly can potentially alleviate the age-related reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. It is also able to decrease hippocampal DNs production and increase memory and learning.",

This study evaluated grape seed extract (GSE) for: a) antiviral potential towards AiV infectivity at 37 °C and room temperature (RT); b) antiviral behavior in model foods (apple juice (AJ) and 2% fat milk) and also simulated gastric environments; and c) potential application as a wash solution on stainless steel surfaces. GSE at 0.5 mg/mL decreased AiV suspensions containing ~4.75 log PFU/mL to titer levels that were not detected after 30 s at both 37 °C and RT. Infectious AiV titers were not detected after 5 min treatment with 1 mg/mL GSE at 37 °C in AJ. GSE at 2 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL in 2% fat milk decreased AiV after 24 h by 1.18 and 1.57 log PFU/mL (4.75 log PFU/mL to 2.86 and 3.25 log PFU/mL), respectively. As a surface wash, GSE at 1 mg/mL after 30 s decreased AiV to undetectable levels under clean conditions. With organic load (mimicking unclean conditions), 2 and 4 mg/mL GSE reduced AiV after 5 min by 1.13 and 1.71 log PFU/mL, respectively. Overall, GSE seems to be a promising antiviral agent against AiV at low concentrations and short contact times.",

The control group was infused with physiological saline. The second group received GSE (50 mg/kg day by day orally) for 2 weeks. The third group was subcutaneously injected with 2.5 million of EST cells. The fourth group was injected with EST cells and treated with GSE extract simultaneously. The fifth group was injected with EST cells and kept for 2 weeks until the appearance of a solid tumor, then treated with GSE for 2 weeks. The phytochemical analysis of GSE revealed the presence of total phenols (17.442 mg GAE/g) and total flavonoid (6.687 mg CE/g) with antioxidant activity of 81.506 mg TE/g DPPH. The Ehrlich solid tumor significantly raised the activities of ALT, AST, and ALP; the level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) in serum; and the protein expressions of hepatic proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and tumor suppressor protein (P53), as well as induced DNA damage and pathological alterations in liver tissue. However, it significantly reduced serum albumin and total protein levels. In contrast, the co- or post-treatment of EST-bearing mice with GSE reduced the activities of ALT, AST, and ALP; the level AFP in serum; and hepatic P53 and PCNA protein expressions. In addition, it reduced EST-induced hepatic DNA damage and pathological alterations, while it increased serum albumin and total protein levels. This study suggested that GSE is a potent hepatoprotective agent and both co- and post-treatment of EST-bearing mice with GSE almost had the same effects.",

Though statins are drugs of choice for hypercholesterolaemia, their effect on male fertility is still controversial and dose-dependent. Grape seed extract (GSE) possess hypocholesterolemic and testicular protective effects. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of low-dose atorvastatin (ATV) on male infertility in hypercholesterolaemic rats and assess the additional value of combining ATV with GSE. METHODS: Male rats were randomized into four groups. The normal group was fed a standard diet. The remaining groups were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 1 month to induce hypercholesterolaemia. Two HFD groups were administered either ATV (1 mg/kg) alone or combined with GSE (200 mg/kg) orally for 65 days, while the third group served as HFD control. KEY FINDINGS: Treatment with ATV or ATV/GSE attenuated dyslipidemia-induced alteration in serum HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and total cholesterol. ATV enhanced serum testosterone, sperm count and motility and fertility index. The effect on testosterone and sperm count was more pronounced by ATV/GSE. Moreover, ATV reduced testicular malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, caspase-9 and caspase-3 while elevated reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase along with catalase activity. Noteworthy, GSE/ATV induced more powerful antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. CONCLUSION: GSE enhanced ATV's protective effect against hypercholesterolaemia-induced infertility via antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.",

Moreover, the total viable count and spoilage bacteria were reduced by > 1 log CFU/g as compared to the control. Changes in microbial flora analysed using high throughput sequencing further indicated that GSE contributed to the notably suppressed growth of Pseudomonas. Also, the accumulation of biogenic amines especially putrescine was decreased (over 0.5-fold) under the combination treatment as compared to the control (P < 0.05).

In prevention, and alongside pharmacological therapy, the use of natural substances has been proven to be extremely helpful for pre- and mild hypertensive subjects. Our study was therefore focused on the effects, both in vitro and in humans, of a grape seed extract, Enovita (GSEe), a highly standardized extract in polyphenols of Vitis vinifera L. The in vitro human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) model was chosen to explore the extract properties related to vascular inflammation/vasodilation. A significant reduction of both soluble Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (sICAM) and endothelin-1 secretion/release was induced by GSEe in HUVEC cells. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in healthy volunteers was further performed to investigate GSEe benefits. In healthy volunteers, both supplementations significantly modulated blood pressure, with a pronounced effect after GSEe tablets (300 mg/day for 16 weeks) in respect to placebo. In the male gender subgroup, no placebo effect was observed as it was for the female group. As an additional outcome, an overall GSEe positive modulation emerged on mood related to stress perception. Thus, GSEe resulted in a benefit of modulating endothelial functionality and blood pressure. It was noteworthy that GSEe relieved the perceived stress, promising new future perspectives on mood comfort.",

Efficiency of 5 concentrations of GSE (0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 g/kg) in retarding oxidation, glyoxal (GO), methylglyoxal (MGO), lysine (Lys), Maillard reaction degree (A294, A420), and Shiff's base were tested. Results showed that 0.5 g/kg GSE before heating significantly (P < 0.05) reduced AGE in fried breast chicken, whereas excessive supplementation of GSE (0.8 and 1 g/kg) was reverse. Air frying was found significantly (P < 0.05) better than deep frying to reduce the precursor substances (GO, MGO, and Lys) of AGE. In conclusion, GSE-derived polyphenols exhibited different inhibitory effects on oxidation and glycosylation at different concentrations.

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a major health concern and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Oxidative stress is an early event in the course of stroke inducing neuro-inflammation and cell death. Grape seed extract (GSE) is a natural phytochemical mixture exhibiting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Orlistat (ORL) is an anti-obesity agent and a gastro-intestinal lipase inhibitor which showed recently beneficial effects on brain lipotoxicity. Recent studies reported the increase of lipase activity upon stroke which led us to investigate the neuroprotective effect of ORL on rat brain I/R injury as well as the putative synergism with GSE. I/R insult infarcted the brain parenchyma as assessed by TTC staining, induced an oxidative stress as revealed by increased lipoperoxidation along with alteration of antioxidant enzymes activities which was corrected using the cotreatment of ORL + GSE. I/R also disturbed the main metabolic pathways involved in brain fueling as glycolysis, neoglucogenesis, glycogenolysis, TCA cycle and electron transfer chain (ETC) complexes. These disturbances were also corrected with the cotreatment ORL + GSE which maintained energetic activities near to the control level. I/R also disrupted transition metals distribution, along with associated enzymes as tyrosinase, LDH or glutamine synthetase activities and induced hippocampal inflammation as revealed by glycogen depletion from dentate gyrus area along with depressed anti-inflammatory IL1β cytokine and increased pro-inflammatory CD68 antigen. Interestingly almost all I/R-induced disturbances were corrected either partially upon ORL and GSE on their own and the best neuroprotection was obtained in the presence of both drugs (ORL + GSE) enabling robust neuroprotection of the sub granular zone within hippocampal dentate gyrus area.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Insulin resistance in adolescents is a major health concern. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of grape seed extract on insulin resistance in adolescents with metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: Participants were divided into grape seed extract (GSE) and placebo groups (n = 24 each) and received 100 mg/day of GSE or placebo and were placed on a weight loss diet for 8 weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical indices, blood pressure, dietary intake, and physical activity were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Forty-two participants completed the trial. After the intervention, the age, sex, baseline values, energy intake and physical activity as a covariate adjusted using ANCOVA for determine differences between groups. The MD (mean difference ±SEM) of HOMA-IR between the GSE group (-1.46 ± 0.45) and the placebo group (-0.48 ± 0.47), (p = 0.020), and the MD of insulin between the GSE group (-7.05 ± 2.11) and the placebo group (-1.71 ± 2.12), (p = 0.024), were significant. Although changes were observed in other variables, they were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: GSE improves insulin concentration and insulin resistance in adolescents with MetS and provides a basis for possible application of the GSE in the clinical management of MetS in adolescents.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ovarian cancer is the deadliest cancer in women. The main challenge in the inhibition of ovarian cancer cells is chemo-resistance. Seeking to overcome this issue, several strategies have been suggested, including the administration of natural products. Grape seed extract (GSE) is a good source of polyphenols and its anticancer effects have been reported by many studies. In this study we aimed to evaluate the effects of GSE on OVCAR-3, a chemo-resistant ovarian cancer line. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: OVCAR-3 cells were treated with GSE (71 μg/mL) for 24 and 48 h. Cell viability and cell apoptosis were measured by MTT and flow cytometry. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle (PTEN, DACT1, AKT, MTOR, GSK3B, C-MYC, CCND1, and CDK4) and apoptosis (BAX, BCl2, CASP3, 8 and 9). The expression of CASP3 protein was evaluated by the CASP3 assay. FINDINGS / RESULTS: The results showed that treatment of OVCAR-3 cells with GSE, increased the expression level of PTEN and DACT1 tumor suppressor genes, as well as apoptotic genes, CASP3, 8, and 9 (P < 0.001). Also, the induction of tumor suppressor genes expression was associated with an increase in the expression of BAX/BCL2 gene ratio as pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. The expression of the genes involved in the cell cycle, CCND1 and CDK4, was inhibited (P < 0.001). The results indicated that GSE induced cell apoptosis in a time-dependent manner (P < 0.001). Also, the GSE treatment resulted in the CASP3 protein expression (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: According to the results of this study, GSE may exert anti-tumorigenic effects on chemo-resistant OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells which might be mediated by the expression of tumor suppressor genes that interact with cell signaling pathways, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis. Hence, the consumption of GSE extract during chemotherapy may overcome part of chemo-resistance in ovarian cancer."

      "abstract": "Hypertension during pregnancy is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide, increasing the risk of complications including preeclampsia, intracerebral hemorrhage and fetal growth restriction. Increased oxidative stress is known to contribute to poor vascular function; however, trials of antioxidant supplementation have raised concerns about fetal outcomes, including risk of low birthweight. Grape seed extract polyphenols (GSEP) have been suggested to promote cardiovascular protection, at least in part through antioxidant actions. We tested the hypothesis that administration of GSEP during pregnancy would reduce oxidative stress and improve resistance artery function with no detrimental effects on fetal growth, in an established model of maternal hypertension associated with vascular dysfunction, the endothelial NO synthase knockout (eNOS-/-) mouse. Pregnant C57BL/6J (WT) and eNOS-/- mice received either GSEP (200 mg/kg/day) or drinking water, between gestational (GD) day 10.5 and GD18.5. At GD17.5, maternal systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured; at GD18.5, maternal malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, vascular function of aortic, mesenteric, uterine and posterior cerebral arteries was assessed, and fetal outcome evaluated. GSEP reduced maternal SBP (P < 0.01) and plasma MDA concentrations (P < 0.01) in eNOS-/- mice. Whilst there was no effect of GSEP on vascular reactivity of aortas, GSEP improved endothelial-dependent relaxation in mesenteric and uterine arteries of eNOS-/- mice (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively) and normalized lumen diameters of pressurized posterior cerebral arteries in eNOS-/- mice (P < 0.001). Supplementation with GSEP had no effect in WT mice and did not affect fetal outcomes in either genotype. Our data suggest that GSEP improve resistance artery function, potentially through antioxidant actions, and provide a basis to further investigate these beneficial effects including in the prevention of intracerebral hemorrhage. Maternal supplementation with GSEP may be a safe intervention to improve outcomes in pregnancies associated with hypertension and vascular dysfunction."

We aimed to investigate the combination of Emu oil (EO) and grape seed extract (GSE) in an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) model of colitis-associated CRC (CA-CRC). C57BL/6 mice (n = 10/group) were injected i.p. with saline or AOM (7.4 mg/kg) and underwent three DSS/water cycles. Mice were orally-gavaged thrice weekly with water (80 μl), EO (80 μl), GSE (80 μl; 400 mg/kg) or combined EO/GSE (160 μl). Mice were euthanized on day 63. AOM/DSS induced significant bodyweight loss (max -21%) and increased disease activity index (DAI) (max +83%) throughout the trial (P < 0.05). EO (max -53%), GSE (max -51%) and EO/GSE (max -71%) reduced DAI scores in AOM/DSS mice in all DSS cycles (P < 0.05). EO/GSE-treatment in AOM/DSS mice resulted in further DAI reduction compared with EO (max -62%) and GSE (max -71%) alone (P < 0.05). AOM/DSS mice presented with severe colonoscopically-assessed colitis at all time-points, which was reduced by EO, GSE and EO/GSE (P < 0.05). EO, GSE and EO/GSE reduced the number of colonic tumours compared with AOM/DSS controls (P < 0.05). Myeloperoxidase (acute inflammation) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran levels (intestinal permeability) were increased in AOM/DSS controls (P < 0.05). EO (-58%) and EO/GSE (-77%) reduced fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran compared with AOM/DSS controls (P < 0.05), with no effect on myeloperoxidase. Histologically-assessed severity scores were increased in the distal colon of AOM/DSS mice compared with saline (P < 0.05), with no effect observed following treatment. The combination of EO and GSE improved clinical indicators and reduced colonic tumours in AOM/DSS treated mice, suggesting potential in CA-CRC management.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this work was to formulate a nanodispersion containing grape seed extract and analyzed its release profile, antioxidant potential of the prepared formulations. METHODS: The grape seed extract (GSE) containing proanthocyanidins (PC's) has been dispersed in polymer matrix soluplus (SOLU) by the freeze-drying method. The morphological analysis was carried out using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The in-vitro release of the nanodispersion formulations was evaluated by simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). The antioxidant activity of GSE and the formulation were evaluated by employing various in-vitro assays such as 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), 2, 2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and peroxidation inhibiting activity. RESULTS: The formulation FIII (1:5) resulted in a stable formulation with a higher loading efficiency of 95.36%, a particle size of 69.90 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.154 and a zeta potential value of -82.10 mV. The antioxidant efficiency of GSE-SOLU evaluated by DPPH was found to be 96.7%. The ABTS and FRAP model exhibited a dose-dependent scavenging activity. Linoleic model of FIII formulation and GSE exhibited a 66.14 and 86.58% inhibition respectively at 200 µg/l. CONCLUSIONS: The main reason for excellent scavenging activity of the formulations can be attributed to the presence of monomeric, dimeric, oligomeric procyanidins and the phenolic group. The present work denotes that GSE constitutes a good source of PC's and will be useful in the prevention and treatment of free radical related diseases.",

The sensory analysis, the total number of viable colonies, the total amount of volatile basic nitrogen, and k-value analysis revealed that GSE retarded the deterioration of snakehead fillets. The degradation of inosine 5'-monophosphate and the accumulation of inosine and hypoxanthine in the GSE group were slower than these in the control group. Moreover, GSE treatment effectively decreased the accumulation of putrescine, cadaverine, and histamine. Illumina-MiSeq high throughput sequencing results showed that GSE inhibited the growth of Aeromonas on snakehead fillets. Based on the microbial enumeration, sensory analysis, and k-value, GSE prolonged the shelf life of fillets for 3 days, suggesting its potential for snakehead fillets preservation.",

The chemical structures of individual hybridized GSE derivatives were identified as 3'-O-decanoyl catechin, 3'-O-decanoyl epicatechin, 3', 5'-2-O-decanoyl epigallocatechin, and 3', 4', 3″, 5″-4-O-decanoyl epicatechin gallate by HPLC-MS2 and 1H and 13C NMR. For growth inhibitory effect on HepG2 cells, hybridized GSE derivatives (EC50 = 44.38 μg/mL) were significantly (p < 0.01) stronger than natural GSE (EC50 = 60.83 μg/mL) due to increased lipophilicity. The effects of GSE derivatives on apoptosis and cell cycle in HepG2 cells were further evaluated by flow cytometry. The results showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells increased markedly in the presence of hybridized GSE derivatives. Moreover, hybridized GSE derivatives were capable of inducing cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. This research suggests that hybridized GSE derivatives are effective lipophilic antioxidants and show the potential as adjuvant therapy for cancer.",

Besides being a wellspring for vitamins and fibre, the skin and seeds of grapes are highly rich in Polyphenols specifically proanthocyanidins, which can be used as a functional ingredient to address various health issues by boosting the natural bio-processes of the body. Since, grape seeds are by product of wine making companies therefore can be easily procured. The present review article briefly describes the various pharmacological activities of grape seed extract and different experimental studies were done which supports the beneficial health qualities of the extract. Through different and various studies, it was proved that the proanthocyanidin rich grape seed extract provides benefits against many diseases i.e. inflammation, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, peptic ulcer, microbial infections, etc. Therefore, beside from using it as a nutraceutical or cosmeceutical, as a result they may have a potential to substitute or complement in currently used drugs in the treatment of diseases by developing it into other successful pharmaceutical formulations for better future prospective."

Eltroxin (100 μg/kg) was administered to mice for 3 weeks, and the mice were posttreated with GSE for another 3 weeks. Results revealed that GSE administered to normal mice did not produce any signs of toxicity and did not cause any biochemical or histopathological changes. Posttreatment of Eltroxin-induced hyperthyroidism mice with GSE daily for 3 weeks improved all examined biochemical or histopathological features. Oral GSE can significantly normalize the elevated level of T3 and T4 in hyperthyroidism animals and elevated the reduced levels of TSH. Moreover, serum urea, creatinine, and electrolyte levels were significantly improved. GSE showed a potent antioxidant capacity in all oxidative stress markers assays (TBARS, reduced GSH, GST, SOD, and CAT) of kidney tissue homogenates. Furthermore, histopathological examination of kidney tissue of Eltroxin + GSE-treated group confirms the potential nephroprotective effect of GSE through increasing the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2.",

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials on the effect of GSE on serum lipid profiles. The online databases of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct and Embase were searched for relevant publications until March 2019, using MeSH and non-MeSH keywords. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were completed independently by two investigators. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Assessment of study quality was conducted using the Jadad scale. Eleven randomised clinical trials involving 536 participants were included in the present meta-analysis. Combining effect sizes from earlier studies, we found that GSE supplementation significantly decreased serum levels of LDL-cholesterol (-0·17 mmol/l; 95 % CI -0·34, -0·01) and TAG (-0·11 mmol/l; 95 % CI -0·18, -0·05). Although no overall significant effect of GSE supplementation on circulating total- and HDL-cholesterol levels was observed, there were significant reductions in these lipids in studies with <10 weeks of intervention and those that had administered the dosages of <300 mg/d of GSE. In conclusion, GSE supplementation seems to favourably affect serum levels of LDL and TAG concentrations, but it did not affect total- and HDL-cholesterol concentrations."

The results showed that 0.5% is the suitable concentration of grape seed extract preservative for the storage of modified atmosphere packaged roast chicken. Compared with normal packaging (A) and single modified atmosphere packaging (M), 0.5% grape seed extract solution combined with modified atmosphere packaging (P) could effectively reduce the growth rate of total aerobic bacteria, Pseudomonas spp., mold, and yeast in roast chicken during low-temperature storage, reduce the lipid oxidation rate in roast chicken, and maintain the color stability of the product.

      "abstract": "Nisin and grape seed extract (GSE) have been widely used as food preservatives; however, the mechanism against pathogens at molecular level has not been well elucidated. This work aimed to investigate their antimicrobial effect against Listeria monocytogenes and to elucidate the mechanism by NMR-based metabolomics. Nisin exhibited enhanced in vitro antilisterial effect when combined with GSE (4.49 log CFU/mL reduction). Marked change in cell membrane permeability was observed in the combination group using confocal laser scanning microscopy; this was verified by increased leakage of protein and nucleic acid. The underlying antimicrobial mechanism was revealed by NMR coupled with multivariate analysis. Significant decreases in threonine, cysteine, ATP, NADP, adenine were observed, whereas a few of metabolites such as lactic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased after nisin-GSE treatment (P < 0.05). Pathway analysis further manifested that the nisin-GSE inhibited the survival of L. monocytogenes by blocking the TCA cycle, amino acid biosynthesis and energy-producing pathway. Lastly, nisin and GSE were applied to shrimp and binary combination showed remarkably antilisterial activity (1.79 log CFU/g reduction). GABA shunt and protein degradation from shrimp compensated the unbalanced glycolysis and amino acid metabolism by providing energy and carbon source for L. monocytogenes inoculated on shrimp. Thus, they were more tolerant to nisin and GSE stresses as compared to the broth-grown culture.",

Estrogen receptors (ERs) are commonly considered as important markers for breast cancer. The present study aimed to evaluate the apoptotic effects of GSE on MCF7 breast cancer cells and assessed the expression of ERβ during treatment of cells with GSE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of GSE in MCF7 breast cancer cells were calculated by treating cells with serial dilution of GSE for 48 hours and cell viability evaluated using MTT assay. Then cells assigned to three groups: control (no treatment), DMSO (cells treated with 0.05% of DMSO) and GSE group (cells treated with of GSE for 48 hours). The apoptosis assay was performed by detecting Annexin V protein by flow cytometry. The gene expression of ERβ and caspase-3 was evaluated by Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: Cells in GSE group treated with GSE IC50 concentration for 48 hours. Annexin V staining assay, represented early apoptosis detected by flow cytometry analysis showed significantly higher expression (p<0.01) than control and DMSO groups. Moreover, results of Real-Time PCR showed a significant expression in ERβ and caspase-3 genes in GSE group compared to control and DMSO groups (Fold change = 2.3 and 3.5, respectively). CONCLUSION: GSE may induce apoptosis in MCF7 human breast cancer cells by activation of ERβ gene.",

Caries are traditionally and successfully prevented by regular fluoride use, but there are opportunities to halt and restore caries with alternative agents in addition to fluoride use. Grape seed extract (GSE) is a readily available plant-based supplement that, due to its concentrated levels of proanthocyanidins, has promising characteristics that may assist in dental caries prevention. AIM: The goal of this review was to investigate whether current research supports use of grape seed extract to prevent dental caries formation. METHODS: A systematic review of articles related to grape seed extract, prevention of dental caries, inhibition of Streptococcus mutans, and remineralization was conducted. Articles were first chosen by inclusion of dental models that used grape seed extract as an intervention, and then by strength of study design. RESULTS: Twenty articles were reviewed. Studies overall supported three unique grape seed extract properties facilitating dental caries prevention. In the first articles reviewed, grape seed extract inhibited proliferation of bacterial biofilms on tooth surfaces. In addition, studies reviewed indicated that grape seed extract promoted dental remineralization. CONCLUSIONS: Caries prevention by grape seed extract may be unique compared with fluoride, and is linked to grape seed extract's bacteriostatic and collagen crosslinking properties. Future research should investigate potential delivery methods, and benefits of combined grape seed extract use with known caries preventative agents, in human participants.",

This study aimed to evaluate the remineralization effectiveness of experimentally prepared grape seed extract hydrogels (GSE) compared to fluoride gel on bleached enamel. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty extracted maxillary incisor were bleached using white smile bleaching agent. Bleached specimens were divided into three groups (10/group) according to the remineralizing agents tested: [GSE 6%, GSE 10%, or fluoride gel]. After bleaching and remineralization procedure, the specimens were stored in artificial saliva at 37°C. Micro-hardness and Energy-Dispersive X-ray and ultra-morphological evaluation were tested at baseline, after bleaching and after remineralization. RESULTS: Statistical significant decrease on mean micro-hardness values had resulted after bleaching procedure compared to baseline, followed by a significant increase in GSE (10%) and fluoride groups. GSE (6%) application showed the least statistical significant mean micro-hardness, which was statistically insignificant different compared to bleaching procedure. Elemental analysis results revealed a statistical significant decrease on Ca, and Ca/P ratios (At%) values after bleaching compared to baseline, followed by a significant increase after treatment with all tested remineralizing gels. SEM photomicrograph of sound enamel shows smooth uniform appearance with few pores. Bleached enamel showed irregular pitted disorganized enamel surface. Bleached enamel exposed to GSE and fluoride gel showed occlusion of enamel surface porosities and precipitates of different sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The specially prepared GSE hydrogels has positive effects on the remineralization process of bleached enamel making it an effective natural agent with remineralizing potential.

This study tried to determine the effect of grape seed extract ointment on CS wound healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial incorporating 129 women eligible for CS in eastern Iran. Participants were selected through convenience sampling method and were subsequently randomly assigned into three groups: 2.5% grape seed extract ointment, 5% grape seed extract ointment, and petrolatum. CS wound healing indices were assessed before the intervention, and 6 and 14 days after the intervention using the REEDA scale (redness, edema, ecchymosis, discharge, and approximation). RESULTS: The mean scores on days 6 and 14 after intervention were respectively 2.02 ± 0.52 and 0.98 ± 0.61 in the 5% ointment group, 2.83 ± 0.54 and 1.58 ± 0.67 in the 2.5% ointment group, and 2.91 ± 0.51 and 1.55 ± 0.74 in the petrolatum group. While the mean score in the 5% ointment group was significantly different from those of 2.5% ointment and petrolatum groups (P < 0.001), the mean score in the 2.5% ointment group was not significantly different from that of the petrolatum group on days 6 and 14 after intervention (P = 0.38 and P = 0.79, respectively). CONCLUSION: The current results suggest that 5% grape seed extract may have beneficial therapeutic effects in promoting CS wound healing.",

Polyphenol supplementation is one nutritional intervention available to limit muscle damage, but there is a lack of published data concerning the use of polyphenol-rich grape seed extract (GSE). This study investigated the effect of acute GSE supplementation on muscle damage markers after eccentric exercise. METHODS: Sixteen healthy male university students (mean age: 20.3 ± 0.4 years, height: 176.1 ± 4.7 cm, weight: 69.9 ± 10.2 kg) were included. Participants were randomly assigned to GSE group (n = 8) or placebo group (n = 8); 300 mg/day of GSE or placebo was consumed from the time of eccentric exercise to 72 h after exercise. For the eccentric exercise, the elbow flexor muscle was activated using a modified preacher curl machine at 25 repetitions for 2 sets. For the muscle damage markers, maximal muscle strength, muscle soreness, and creatine kinase (CK) level were measured. RESULTS: There was no difference in maximal muscle strength and muscle soreness between groups in the recovery stage after eccentric exercise (p > 0.05); CK level, a marker of cell membrane damage, was significantly decreased 96 h after exercise in the GSE group compared with the placebo group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acute GSE supplement can be an effective way to decrease cellular membrane damage after eccentric exercise. These results could be helpful in the application of GSE supplementation as a nutritional intervention to reduce muscle damage after high intensity strength training, especially in the early stage of a new strength training program. However, a larger scale study is necessary to validate these results."

Molecular insights into pathophysiology of ischemic stroke are still obscure, and the present study investigated the protective effect of high dosage Grape Seed Extract (GSE 2.5 g/kg) on brain ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury using a proteomic approach. Ischemia was realized by occlusion of the common carotid arteries for 30 min followed by 1 h reperfusion on control or GSE pre-treated rats, and a label-free quantification followed by mass spectrometry analysis used to evaluate I/R induced alterations in protein abundance and metabolic pathways as well as the protection afforded by GSE. I/R-induced whole brain ionogram dyshomeostasis, ultrastructural alterations, as well as inflammation into hippocampal dentate gyrus area, which were evaluated using ICP-OES, transmission electron microscopy and immuno-histochemistry respectively. I/R altered the whole brain proteome abundance among which 108 proteins were significantly modified (35 up and 73 down-regulated proteins). Eighty-four proteins were protected upon GSE treatment among which 27 were up and 57 down-regulated proteins, suggesting a potent protective effect of GSE close to 78%of the disturbed proteome. Furthermore, GSE efficiently prevented the brain from I/R-induced ion dyshomeostasis, ultrastructural alterations, inflammatory biomarkers as CD56 or CD68 and calcium burst within the hippocampus. To conclude, a potent protective effect of GSE on brain ischemia is evidenced and clinical trials using high dosage GSE should be envisaged on people at high risk for stroke.",

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the stimulatory potential of GSE in the functional activity of undifferentiated pulp cells and odontoblast-like cells. OD-21 and MDPC-23 cell lines were cultivated in odontogenic medium until subconfluence, seeded in 24-well culture plates in a concentration of 2x104/well and divided into: 1) OD-21 without GSE; 2) OD-21+10 µg/mL of GSE; 3) MDPC-23 without GSE; 4) MDPC-23+10 µg/mL of GSE. Cell proliferation, in situ detection of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total protein content were assessed after 3, 7 and 10 days, and mineralization was evaluated after 14 days. The data were analyzed by ANOVA statistical tests set at a 5% level of significance. Results revealed that cell proliferation increased after 10 days, and protein content, after 7 days of culture in MDPC-23 cells. In situ ALP staining intensity was higher in undifferentiated pulp cells and odontoblast-like cells after 7 and 10 days, respectively. A discrete increase in MDPC-23 mineralization after GSE treatment was observed despite OD-21 cells presenting a decrease in mineralized nodule deposits. Data suggest that GSE favors functional activity of differentiated cells more broadly than undifferentiated cells (OD-21). More studies with different concentrations of GSE must be conducted to confirm its benefits to cells regarding dentin regeneration.",

      "abstract": "Multidrug resistance is a major hindrance in managing cancer. By performing a series of experiments in chemoresistant colorectal cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) from grape seed extracts can sensitize both acquired (HCT116-FOr cells) and innately chemoresistant (H716 cells) cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and oxaliplatin, by inhibiting adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. When combined with chemotherapeutic drugs, OPCs significantly inhibited growth of the chemoresistant cells (P < 0.05 to < 0.001) and decreased the expression of several key ABC transporters. Moreover, the activity of the ABC transporters was also significantly decreased by OPCs in the cell lines (P < 0.05). We further confirmed that co-treatment with OPCs sensitized the chemoresistant cells to 5FU and oxaliplatin, as observed by improvement in cell cycle arrest, double-strand breaks and p53 accumulation in these cells. In addition, we confirmed that co-administration of OPCs with chemotherapeutic drugs significantly decreased chemoresistant xenograft tumor growth in mice (P < 0.05). Together, our study illuminates the downregulation of multiple ABC transporters as a mechanism by which OPCs overcome chemoresistance in cancer cells and may serve as adjunctive treatments in patients with refractory colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the potential biostimulatory effects of grape seed extract (GSE) on a primary culture of human pulp cells. METHODOLOGY: Human molars were used to obtain the primary pulp cell culture and 0.5-mm dentine discs. For GSE direct exposure, dose-response (0.0065-6.5%) and time response (1-60 min of contact) were examined. For transdentinal exposure, 0.65% of GSE was tested for 24 h. Cellular metabolism, nitric oxide and collagen production, and cell morphology alterations were assessed at periods of 24 and 72 h. After cell differentiation and direct exposure to GSE, the total protein production (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and formation of mineralization nodules (MN) were assessed. The results were analysed by parametric tests or non-parametric tests (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The lower concentration of GSE tested (0.0065%) was associated with an increase in cellular metabolism, a reduction in the production of nitric oxide and an increase in extracellular matrix synthesis (collagen). Distinct behaviours were observed for the different concentrations, without a reduction of cellular metabolism >10% compared with the control, either when applied directly or transdentinally. SEM revealed no significant change in cell morphology, except for the positive control (H2 O2 ). There was no difference in TP, ALP or MN between the control group and the group exposed to GSE. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with grape seed extract, even at the highest concentration and longest period, caused neither direct nor transdentinal cytotoxic effects on human pulp cells. Grape seed extract components may play a biostimulatory role and protect dental pulp cells when in direct contact.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of treatment with grape seed extract (GSE) on the neurotoxic and genotoxic effects of acute malathion exposure. Rats received malathion (150 mg/kg by i.p. injection) for two successive days alone or combined with GSE at doses of 150 or 300 mg/kg, orally or with GSE at 300 mg/kg and atropine at a dose of 2 mg/kg, i.p. Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide, paraoxonase (PON1) were determined in cortex, striatum, and rest of brain tissue (subcortex). Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities were determined in brain regions. Cytogenetic analyses for chromosomal aberrations in somatic and germ cells, micronucleus test, Comet assay, DNA fragmentation of liver cells and histopathological examination of brain and liver sections were also performed. Malathion resulted in an increase in MDA, nitric oxide; a decrease in GSH and PON1 activity in different brain regions. IL-1β increased, while BChE activity decreased in brain after the administration of malathion. The insecticide also caused marked structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations and increased liver DNA fragmentation. The Comet assay showed a significant increase in DNA damage of peripheral blood lymphocytes. These effects of malathion were alleviated with the administration of GSE alone or combined with atropine. Addition of atropine to treatment with GSE was associated with significant decrease in MDA, BChE and chromosomal aberrations compared with GSE only treatment. Our data indicate that GSE protects against malathion neurotoxic and genotoxic effects, most likely through reducing brain oxidative stress and inflammatory response.",

Effects of placebo and GSE (300 mg) on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), total vascular conductance (TVC), and rate × pressure product (RPP) in response to two submaximal cycling workloads (40% and 60% VO2peak) were compared 2 h after ingestion of GSE or placebo on different days, 1 week apart. Endothelial function was also evaluated using flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Placebo treatment had no effect on any of the variables. GSE supplementation attenuated MAP at both workloads (40% VO2peak: 115 ± 1 vs. 112 ± 2 mmHg; 60% VO2peak: 126 ± 2 vs. 123 ± 2 mmHg) and RPP at the lower workload. Conversely, SV, CO, and TVC were augmented during both workloads. FMD was augmented by GSE (18.9 ± 2.0 vs. 12.4% ± 2.0%). These findings indicate that in exercising prehypertensive males, a single dose of GSE reduces blood pressure, peripheral vasoconstriction, and work of the heart and enhances O2 delivery; effects that may be due, in part, to endothelium-dependent vasodilation. We propose that acute GSE treatment represents an intervention that may minimize potential increases in the risk of cardiovascular events during dynamic exercise in prehypertensives.",

DEX treatment caused a significant decrease in body weight gain and weight of testes. Significant alterations in enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants were observed. Moreover, a marked reduction in plasma testosterone levels and thyroid profile was observed. The administration of GSE significantly attenuated the deleterious effects of oxidative stress induced by DEX, as well as attenuated DEX-induced testicular and thyroid damage.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty sound human teeth fragments of ten teeth were obtained from the cervical portion of the roots and were stored in demineralizing solution for 96 h at 37°C to induce artificial root carious lesion. The sections then were divided into four treatment groups including: 6.5% GSE, CPP-ACP, 0.5% CaGP, and control group (no treatment). The demineralized samples were then pH cycled through treatment solutions, acidic buffer, and neutral buffer for 8 days at six cycles per day. The samples were subsequently evaluated using PLM. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Scheffe post hoc comparison test (P < 0.001). RESULTS: PLM data revealed a significantly thicker mineral precipitation band on the surface layer of the GSE-treated lesions compared to the other groups (P < 0.001).

      "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis is common in a variety of inflammatory lung diseases, such as interstitial pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and silicosis. There is currently no effective clinical drug treatment. It has been reported that grape seed extracts (GSE) has extensive pharmacological effects with minimal toxicity. Although it has been found that GSE can improve the lung collagen deposition and fibrosis pathology induced by bleomycin in rat, its effects on pulmonary function, inflammation, growth factors, matrix metalloproteinases and epithelial-mesenchymal transition remain to be researched. In the present study, we studied whether GSE provided protection against bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse pulmonary fibrosis. ICR strain mice were treated with BLM in order to establish pulmonary fibrosis models. GSE was given daily via intragastric administration for three weeks starting at one day after intratracheal instillation. GSE at 50 or 100mg/kg significantly reduced BLM-induced inflammatory cells infiltration, proinflammatory factor protein expression, and hydroxyproline in lung tissues, and improved pulmonary function in mice. Additionally, treatment with GSE also significantly impaired BLM-induced increases in lung fibrotic marker expression (collagen type I alpha 1 and fibronectin 1) and decreases in an anti-fibrotic marker (E-cadherin). Further investigation indicated that the possible molecular targets of GSE are matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) and TGF-β1, given that treatment with GSE significantly prevented BLM-induced increases in MMP-9 and TGF-β1 expression in the lungs. Together, these results suggest that supplementation with GSE may improve the quality of life of lung fibrosis patients by inhibiting MMP-9 and TGF-β1 expression in the lungs.",

Diode laser application groups received 8 J/cm2 dose LLLT once a day for 4 days (810 nm wavelength, continuous mode, 0.25 W, 9 s). As a result of the biological parameter analysis, it was determined that the oxidative damage caused by the IWs and recovery period on 7th and 14th days could be substantially removed with GSE applications that have antioxidant capacity especially in rat liver tissue. In addition, the active compound of grape seed, catechin is studied in the active site of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) target using molecular modeling approaches. Post-processing molecular dynamics (MD) results for catechin is compared with a standard GSK3 inhibitor. MD simulations assisted for better understanding of inhibition mechanism and the crucial amino acids contributing in the ligand binding. These results along with a through free energy analysis of ligands using sophisticated simulations methods are quite striking and it suggests a greater future role for simulation in deciphering complex patterns of molecular mechanism in combination with methods for understanding drug-receptor interactions.",

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the effects of GSE administration on the metabolic status of female volleyball players. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed among 40 female volleyball players. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, with members of the test group (n = 20) taking 300 mg of GSE twice a day for eight weeks and members of the control group (n = 20) taking a placebo pearl for the same period. Fasting blood samples were taken before and after the eight-week intervention period in order to determine the related variables. RESULTS: Supplementation with GSE resulted in a significant rise in the plasma glutathione (GSH) level (+265.5 ± 344.2 vs. +2.2 ± 378.2 µmol/L, P = 0.02), as well as a significant decrease in the malondialdehyde (MDA) level (-1.4 ± 2.0 vs. -0.2 ± 1.2 µmol/L, P = 0.01) when compared to the placebo group. In addition, when compared to the group that received the placebo, the subjects who received GSE had significantly decreased serum insulin concentrations (-23.4 ± 23.4 vs. +1.8 ± 25.2 pmol/L, P = 0.002), a decreased homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (-0.7 ± 0.7 vs. +0.2 ± 0.9, P = 0.002), and an increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (+0.01 ± 0.01 vs. -0.01 ± 0.02, P = 0.03). The administration of GSE had no significant effects on creatine phosphokinase (CPK), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), nitric oxide (NO), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and lipid concentrations when compared with the administration of the placebo. However, after controlling for baseline NO levels, age, and baseline BMI, the changes in the plasma NO concentrations were significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, taking GSE for eight weeks had beneficial effects on the plasma GSH, MDA levels, and markers of insulin metabolism of female volleyball players."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized trial, 87 patients undergoing elective and isolated coronary bypass surgery included. The patients were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 29 each): (1) Control group with no treatment, (2) GSE group who received the extract 24 h before operation, 100 mg every 6 h, orally, (3) Vitamin C group who received 25 mg/kg Vitamin C through CPB during surgery. Blood samples were taken from coronary sinus at (T1) just before aortic cross clamp; (T2) just before starting controlled aortic root reperfusion; and (T3) 10 min after root reperfusion. Some clinical parameters and biochemical markers were compared among the groups. RESULTS: There were significant differences in tracheal intubation times, sinus rhythm return, and left ventricular function between treatment groups compared with control (P < 0.05). Total antioxidant capacity was higher (P < 0.05) in both grape seed and Vitamin C groups at T2 and T3 times. In reperfusion period, malondialdehyde level was increased in control group; however, it was significantly lower for the grape seed group (P = 0.04). The differences in the mean levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase among the three groups were not significant (P > 0.05 in all cases). CONCLUSIONS: In our patients, GSE and Vitamin C had antioxidative effects and reduced deleterious effects of CPB during coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.",

The aim of the study was first to explore the effects of grape seed extract (GSE) in HCV replication, and then to study mechanisms. The results indicated that a GSE treatment showed significant anti-HCV activity and suppressed HCV-elevated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. In contrast, exogenous COX-2 expression gradually attenuated antiviral effects of GSE, suggesting that GSE inhibited HCV replication by suppressing an aberrant COX-2 expression caused by HCV, which was correlated with the inactivation of IKK-regulated NF-κB and MAPK/ERK/JNK signaling pathways. In addition, GSE also attenuated HCV-induced inflammatory cytokine gene expression. Notably, a combined administration of GSE with interferon or other FDA-approved antiviral drugs revealed a synergistic anti-HCV effect. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the possibility of developing GSE as a dietary supplement to treat patients with a chronic HCV infection."

Methods: Male rats were divided into three groups: control, DOX (2 mg/kg/48h, for 12 days) and GSE (100 mg/kg/24h, for 16 days) plus DOX. Left ventricular (LV) function and hemodynamic parameters were assessed using echocardiography, electrocardiography and a Millar pressure catheter. Histopathological analysis and in vitro antitumor activity were also evaluated. Results: DOX induced heart damage in rats through decreasing the left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures, rate of rise/decrease of LV pressure, ejection fraction, fractional shortening and contractility index as demonstrated by echocardiography, electrocardiography and hemodynamic parameters relative to control group. Our data demonstrated that GSE treatment markedly attenuated DOX-induced toxicity, structural changes in myocardium and improved ventricular function. Additionally, GSE did not intervene with the antitumor effect of DOX. Conclusion: Collectively, the results suggest that GSE is potentially protective against DOX-induced toxicity in rat heart and maybe increase therapeutic index of DOX in human cancer treatment."

We sought to determine whether an extract of olive and grape seed standardized according to hydroxytyrosol (HT) and procyanidins (PCy) content, exerts preventive anti-osteoathritic effects. To this aim, we evaluated whether the HT/PCy mix could (i) have in vitro anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective actions, (ii) exert anti-osteoarthritis effects in two post-traumatic animal models and (iii) retain its bioactivity after oral administration. Anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective actions of HT/PCy were tested on primary cultured rabbit chondrocytes stimulated by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). The results showed that HT/PCy exerts anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective actions in vitro. The preventive effect of HT/PCy association was assessed in two animal models of post-traumatic OA in mice and rabbits. Diet supplementation with HT/PCy significantly decreased the severity of post-traumatic osteoarthritis in two complementary mice and rabbit models. The bioavailability and bioactivity was evaluated following gavage with HT/PCy in rabbits. Regular metabolites from HT/PCy extract were found in sera from rabbits following oral intake. Finally, sera from rabbits force-fed with HT/PCy conserved anti-IL-1β effect, suggesting the bioactivity of this extract. To conclude, HT/PCy extract may be of clinical significance for the preventive treatment of osteoarthritis.",

      "abstract": "Azathioprine (AZA) is an important drug commonly used in the therapy of the autoimmune system disorders. It induces many hazard effects that restrict its use. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of AZA on the fetal development and renal function and its co-administration with either folic acid (FA) or grape seed extract (GSE). The effects of administration of GSE or FA on AZA toxicity by gavage simultaneously for 4 weeks were studied by determining the changes in kidney histology, the glutathione level (GSH), and lipid per oxidation content as malondialdehyde in the kidney tissue. Additionally, their effects on the fetal development were investigated. Azathioprine induced a renal damage as indicated from the pronounced changes in histological structure, a significant increase in serum urea and creatinine, and malondialdehyde content in the kidney tissue. Meanwhile, the GSH activity was significantly decreased. Co-treatment with GSE significantly minimized the previously mentioned hazard effects of AZA by ameliorating the antioxidant activity. At this point, FA induced a nonsignificant protective activity. The results also revealed that administration of FA or GSE at 6th to 15th day of gestation did not altered fetal development. While, AZA administration clearly disturbed fetal development as indicated from a significant decrease in fetal weights. Furthermore, co-administration of both drugs significantly minimized similarly the hazards of AZA on the fetal development. It may be concluded that GSE and FA are a useful remedies. Maternal administrations of either both are protective agents against AZA-induced fetal malformations. Grape seed extract was more active than FA in potentiating the antioxidative defenses for controlling AZA-induced oxidative renal damages. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDS AND OBJECTIVE: Several clinical trials have shown that grape seed extract can reduce blood pressure, but the results are often irreproducible. We therefore sought to systematically evaluate the impact of grape seed extract treatment on the changes of systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) by meta-analyzing available randomized controlled trials. METHODS: Trial selection and data extraction were completed independently by 2 investigators. Effect-size estimates were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Twelve articles involving 16 clinical trials and 810 study subjects were analyzed. Overall analyses found significant reductions for SBP (WMD = -6.077; 95% CI: -10.736 to -1.419; P = 0.011) and DBP (WMD = -2.803; 95% CI: -4.417 to -1.189; P = 0.001) after grape seed extract treatment. In subgroup analyses, there were significant reductions in younger subjects (mean age < 50 years) for SBP (WMD = -6.049; 95% CI: -10.223 to -1.875; P = 0.005) and DBP (WMD = -3.116; 95% CI: -4.773 to -1.459; P < 0.001), in obese subjects (mean body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m) for SBP (WMD = -4.469; 95% CI: -6.628 to -2.310; P < 0.001), and in patients with metabolic syndrome for SBP (WMD = -8.487; 95% CI: -11.869 to -5.106; P < 0.001). Further meta-regression analyses showed that age, body mass index, and baseline blood pressure were negatively associated with the significant reductions of SBP and DBP after treatment. There was no indication of publication bias. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that grape seed extract exerted a beneficial impact on blood pressure, and this impact was more obvious in younger or obese subjects, as well as in patients with metabolic disorders. In view of the small sample size involved, we agree that confirmation of our findings in a large-scale, long-term, multiple-dose randomized controlled trial, especially among hypertensive patients is warranted.",

In addition, qualitative DNA fragmentation was examined using agarose gel electrophoresis. Triton-treatment caused significant disturbances in the hematological parameters, the neurological functions, and the antioxidant profile. Also, triton significantly increased the iNOS mRNA expression and DNA damage. Our results showed that grape seed extract and/or vitamin B6 could attenuate all the examined parameters.

Cadmium disturbs the neurotransmitter dopamine, resulting in low energy, lack of motivation, and depression, which are predisposing factors for violence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ameliorative effect of grape seed extract (GSE) on the brain of 40 male albino rats after exposure to cadmium chloride (Cd) toxicity. The rats were separated into either the control group, the Cd group, the GSE group, or the GSE and Cd mixture (treated) group. The cerebrum showed evidence of degeneration of some nerve fibers and cells. Fibrosis, vacuolations, and congestion in the blood vessels were demonstrated. Satelletosis was located in the capsular cells. Immunohistochemical expression of Bax was strongly positive in the Cd group and decreased in the treated group. These histopathological changes were decreased in the brain tissue of the treated group, but a few blood vessels still had evidence of congestion. Cadmium administration increased the level of MDA and decreased MAO-A, acetylcholinesterase, and glutathione reductase (GR), while the treatment with GSE affected the alterations in these parameters. In addition, cadmium downregulated the mRNA expression levels of GST and GPx, while GSE treatment normalized the transcript levels. The expression of both dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter was downregulated in the rats administered cadmium and the addition of GSE normalized the expression of these aggression associated genes.",

These compounds are potent antioxidants and exert many health-promoting effects. This study aimed to determine the effects of RGSE on serum levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein AI (apo-AI) levels and paraoxonase (PON) activity in patients with mild to moderate hyperlipidemia (MMH). DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at Shahid-Modarres Hospital (Tehran, Iran) and Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Seventy MMH patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment (200 mg/day of RGSE) or placebo for eight weeks. RESULTS: Significant elevation in serum levels of apo-AI (P = 0.001), HDL-C (P = 0.001) and PON activity (P = 0.001) and marked decreases in concentrations of TC (P = 0.015), TG (P = 0.011) and LDL-C (P = 0.014) were found in the cases. PON activity was significantly correlated with apo-AI (r = 0.270; P < 0.01) and HDL-C (r = 0.45; P < 0.001). Significant differences between the RGSE and control groups (before and after treatment) for TC (P = 0.001), TG (P = 0.001), PON (P = 0.03), apo-AI (P = 0.001) and LDL-C (P = 0.002) were seen. CONCLUSION: It is possible that RGSE increases PON activity mostly through increasing HDL-C and apo-AI levels in MMH patients. It may thus have potential beneficial effects in preventing oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in these patients.",

At 5×10(5)CFU/ml inoculation level, 4mg/ml GSE effectively inhibited the growth of all tested strains, while 0.25-2mg/ml GSE delayed bacterial growth. At a higher inoculation level (1×10(7)CFU/ml), GSE had less efficacy against the growth of the selected six non-O157 STECs. Its impact on bacterial virulence was then assessed at this inoculation level. Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a universal signal molecule mediating quorum sensing (QS). GSE at concentration as low as 0.5mg/ml dramatically reduced AI-2 production of all non-O157 STECs tested, with the inhibitory effect proportional to GSE levels. Consistent with diminished QS, GSE at concentration of 0.125mg/ml caused marked reduction of swimming motility of all motile non-O157 STECs tested. In agreement, GSE treatment reduced the production of flagella protein FliC and its regulator FliA in E. coli O103:H2 and E. coli O111:H2. Furthermore, 4mg/ml GSE inhibited the production of Shiga toxin, a major virulence factor, in E. coli O103:H2 and E. coli O111:H2. In summary, GSE inhibits the growth of \"top-six\" non-O157 STECs at the population level relevant to food contamination. At higher initial population, GSE suppresses QS with concomitant decrease in motility, flagella protein expression and Shiga toxin production. Thus, GSE has the potential to be used in food industry to control non-O157 STEC.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is the most prevalent toxic metal present in livestock feed; therefore, the present study aimed to examine the ameliorative effects of grape seed extract (GSE) on cadmium chloride (CdCl2)‑induced testicular dysfunction of Wistar rats. Male adult Wistar rats (40 rats; n=10/group) were divided into four equal groups. Group one was used as a control, and was given ad libitum access to food and water. Groups 2‑4 were treated with CdCl2 [5 mg/kg body weight (BW)], GSE (400 mg/kg BW, orally), and GSE plus CdCl2, respectively. Blood and testicular tissues were collected and assayed for biochemical and histopathological changes, respectively. Testicular genes were expressed using semi‑quantitative RT‑PCR analysis. The results of the present study demonstrated that there was a decrease in serum testosterone levels following CdCl2 toxicity, which were normalized after GSE co-administration. Furthermore, CdCl2 significantly increased the serum levels of malondialdehyde, and decreased levels of antioxidants. At the histopathological level, the testes of the CdCl2 group exhibited congestion, edema in the interstitial blood vessels, irregular arrangement of the epithelial lining of the seminiferous tubules, and degeneration and sloughing of the spermatogenic cells, which accumulated in the center of the seminiferous tubules. Such pathological alterations were ameliorated following treatment with GSE in the CdCl2 plus GSE group. The immunohistochemical expression of B‑cell lymphoma 2‑associated X protein was high in the CdCl2 group, and low in the control and GSE groups. Co‑treatment with GSE and CdCl2 exhibited ameliorative effects on the immunoreactivity of B‑cell lymphoma 2‑associated X protein. CdCl2 toxicity induced a significant downregulation in the mRNA expression levels of cytochrome P450 cholesterol side‑chain cleavage enzyme, cytochrome P450 17A1, 3β‑hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β‑HSD), 17β‑HSD, androgen receptor, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, and follicle‑stimulating hormone receptor. GSE administration exhibited a stimulatory effect on steroidogenesis‑associated enzymes, and co‑treatment with GSE and CdCl2 normalized and upregulated the mRNA expression levels of these examined genes. This study concluded that GSE has beneficial protective effects against the deleterious effects of CdCl2 on the testis.",

After slaughter (27 kg LBW), m. longissimus thoracis et lumborum was sliced, packaged under modified atmosphere (80:20%/O2:CO2) and stored in retail conditions for 14 days. At each sampling day (0, 4, 7, 11, 14), microbiological, physico-chemical and sensory characteristics were analysed. Meat from VIT-E presented lower microbial counts than CTRL, GSE and GP-5, without differences between polyphenol treatments (GSE and GP-5) and CTRL. Vitamin E reduced meat discoloration and lipid oxidation (TBARS values) from day 7 with respect to the other treatments. Although not significant, an improvement in TBARS values of about 20% was observed for GSE and GP-5, compared with CTRL, from day 7 of storage. VIT-E dietary treatment was more effective in preventing sensory spoilage than the other treatments.",

      "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is a major risk factor for gastritis, gastric ulcers and gastric cancer. Traditional therapy with proton pump inhibitor and antibiotics is regarded as optimal for H. pylori eradication whereas, the eradication rate is unsatisfactory. Studies have reported that cranberry may inhibit H. pylori adhesion to the human gastric mucus but lack of other berry extracts have been evaluated in clinical study. Thus, a 9-week add-on randomised controlled trial was conducted to explore the impact of blueberry and grape seed extract (BGE) combinations traditional therapy for H. pylori eradication. In results, we found that there was no significant difference of eradication rate between the berry extract group and placebo group in the intention-to-treat analysis and in the per-protocol analysis (94.64% versus 84.62%, p = 0.085). Diarrhoea, constipation and epigastric pain were observed increasing during ingestion of the berry extract in some cases. In conclusion, this study indicated that no significant difference existed between the BGE extract group and placebo group in eradication rate under triple therapy.",
