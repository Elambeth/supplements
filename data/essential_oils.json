      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Premenstrual syndrome and menstrual symptoms adversely affect approximately 80-95% of women of reproductive age. Aromatherapy interventions are used to reduce premenstrual syndrome and menstrual symptoms. This study was conducted to determine the effect of aromatherapy intervention with bergamot and grapefruit essential oils on premenstrual syndrome and menstrual symptoms. METHODS: Ninety women with premenstrual syndrome were included the study. Participants were randomly divided into 3 groups: Bergamot(n = 30), Grapefruit(n = 30), Placebo(n = 30). Participants in each group were made to smell pure essential oil for 30 min 3 times a day for 4 days during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The used was repeated in 3 menstrual cycles. \"Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS)\" was used to evaluate premenstrual syndrome and \"Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ)\" was used to evaluate menstrual symptoms. All measurements were performed before and after the study. RESULTS: The results showed that grapefruit essential oil was effective in reducing PMSS total score (p = 0.010) and sub-scale scores (depressive affect, anxiety, fatigue, depressive thoughts, appetite changes, sleep changes and bloating (p < 0.001), irritability (p = 0.024), pain (p = 0.047)). Although grapefruit essential oil had no effect on the total score of the MSQ. Grapefruit essential oil was found to be effective in reducing the MSQ scale sub-scale scores (menstrual pain symptoms (p = 0.024) and the use of coping methods with menstrual pain (p = 0.011)). Bergamot essential oil was found to be effective in reducing PMSS total score (p = 0.001) and PMSS sub-scale scores depressive affect (p = 0.013), irritability (p = 0.034), depressive thoughts and appetite changes (p = 0.026), pain (p = 0.001)). In addition, there was no effect on the menstrual syndrome scale and its sub-dimensions (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Grapefruit essential oil was effective in reducing both premenstrual syndrome and menstrual symptoms, whereas bergamot essential oil was only effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms.

      "abstract": "Our objective was to evaluate the effect of a nitrogen additive with extruded urea with essential oils based on garlic and cinnamon on the resistance to gastrointestinal worms and on the performance of lambs in the finishing phase. Fourteen male sheep were used, with an average age of 18 months and an average initial body weight of 23.5 kg. The lambs were divided into two nutritional treatments: control and nitrogen additive. The control treatment was composed of a roughage: concentrate ratio of 60:40, with the roughage being whole plant corn silage and the concentrate being based on corn and soybean meal. The test treatment was prepared in the same manner as the control treatment, with the addition of a commercial nitrogen additive NFeed® (extruded urea plus essential oils derived from garlic-Allium sativum, and cinnamon-Cinnamomum sp). Each experimental group was allocated to its respective area, provided with stalls where collective feeders were located, and simultaneously had access to areas formed by Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu, which were previously contaminated by sheep with high FEC (> 1000). Fecal samples were collected directly from the rectal ampulla of each lamb, at 15-day intervals. The lambs were evaluated for productive performance and total diet consumption. In terms of FEC, there was a notable disparity between the treatments on day 60 of the experiment. The FEC results show that 88.57% of the lambs in the control group had a high count (> 1000), while 65.71% of the lambs in the nitrogen additive group had a high count (> 1000). The lambs in the control treatment showed a higher average daily gain (ADG) compared to the lambs in the nitrogen additive treatment, without any negative impact on total weight gain. Lambs fed a diet consisting of silage and concentrate based on corn and soybean meal, plus a nitrogen additive with essential oils derived from garlic and cinnamon showed a lower parasitic load compared to lambs that received only silage and concentrate based on corn and soybean meal in their diet. The nitrogen additive diet did not effectively improve the lambs' productive performance or the intake efficiency of the diet. Plant compounds derived from garlic and cinnamon have an anthelmintic effect, suggesting that these natural compounds associated with nitrogen additives (NFeed®) have the potential for phytotherapeutic use in managing gastrointestinal nematodes in small ruminants.",

      "abstract": "Background: Disruption of the natural balance of the skin microbiota can impair wound healing and contribute to chronic infections. Identifying the bacterial species involved and understanding their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles are essential for guiding treatment, especially given the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Methods: This study characterized the virulence and antibiotic resistance phenotypes of 43 bacterial strains isolated from chronic wounds. The antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils (sandalwood, ylang-ylang, sage, cajeput, and juniper), pharmaceutical products (propolis tinctures, usnic acid), and probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains (Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis) was assessed using qualitative and quantitative assays, including MIC, MICBA, and co-culture evaluations. Results: Gram-positive strains were more sensitive to essential oils than Gram-negative strains, with sandalwood, ylang-ylang, and propolis tincture showing the strongest antibacterial effects. These agents also showed significant biofilm inhibition. Probiotic strains exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Morganella morganii, with Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus being particularly effective in reducing bacterial growth and adhesion in vitro. Conclusions: Essential oils and probiotic strains demonstrate promising antimicrobial effects against chronic wound pathogens and may serve as alternative or adjunctive treatments to antibiotics. Further clinical research and standardization are necessary to establish their safety, efficacy, and optimal application protocols."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Fungal infections have significant health risks due to virulence factors like biofilms that lead to chronic and persistent infections. To decrease associated rates of morbidity and mortality, it is crucial to develop effective antifungal treatments. The present study aims to evaluate the bioactive potential of Ferulago spp. essential oils by assessing their effect on dermatophytes and wound healing, as these fungi are often associated with wound infection. METHODS: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal lethal concentration (MLC) of five essential oils were assessed on planktonic dermatophytes and the most promising were used to evaluate their effect on the formation and disruption of biofilms, by quantifying biofilm mass using crystal violet and extracellular matrix deposition using safranin staining. Alterations in fungal morphology were confirmed by optical microscopy and a cell migration assay was used to assess wound-healing capacity. RESULTS: Ferulago silaifolia essential oil characterized by high amounts of α-pinene (45.4%) and cis-crysanthenyl acetate (39.1%) was the most active, particularly against Microsporum canis and Trichophyton rubrum (MIC = 50 µg/mL). Regarding biofilm assays, Trichophyton rubrum was the most susceptible strain, with both biofilm mass and extracellular matrix being highly compromised with an evident decrease in hyphal growth and mycelial density. In addition, this essential oil significantly increased fibroblast migration at 25 μg/mL, indicating a wound-healing effect that could prevent systemic infections. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides new insights into the treatment of dermatophytosis by highlighting the antivirulent effects of F. silaifolia essential oil and its potential wound-healing properties."

      "abstract": "The toxicity of synthetic pesticides to non-target organisms has prompted a shift towards more environmentally friendly agricultural pest control methods, including the use of essential oils as possible biopesticides. Before these natural chemicals can be widely adopted for protecting food supplies and human health, it is crucial to evaluate their impacts on pollinators, such as honey bees. In this study, we examined the effects of one commercially available essential oil mixture (EcoTec+) and four essential oil components (β-bisabolene, cinnamaldehyde, 1,8-cineole, and eugenol) on honey bee workers using feeding or spray treatment. We then assessed the responses of esterase (EST), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), acetylcholine esterase (AChE), and P450. EcoTec+ increased the P450 transcript, while bisabolene inhibited EST and AChE, increased GST, and caused a mixed P450 response without being lethal. Cinnamaldehyde exhibited toxicity when ingested, suppressing P450 and eliciting a mixed response in AChE. Cineole inhibited EST but caused a mixed P450 response. Eugenol suppressed EST and AChE and was toxic on contact. We also assayed combinations of each compound with four synthetic formulations representative of the major pesticide categories, though no significant interactions were found. Overall, the essential oils tested did not cause acute lethal toxicity to honey bees; however, their biochemical effects varied, mostly remaining sublethal. These findings suggest that these essential oils could be considered safe for use around honey bees."

      "abstract": "The decline in the bee colony strength due to high levels of Varroa destructor infestations necessitates the development of new control methods. This study evaluates the effectiveness of glycerin-oxalic acid strips and essential oils in managing Varroa destructor. The experiment was conducted in 2022 at the experimental apiary in Debelec, part of the Institute of Animal Husbandry in Kostinbrod. Six experimental groups, each treated with a different preparation, were compared to a control group of untreated colonies. Treatments included Beevital Hiveclean (20 ml per colony), Varro Red (2 ml per frame), ammonium nitrate strips (1.3 mm), glycerin-oxalic acid strips (1.3 mm), and glycerin-oxalic acid strips of paper-cellulose (2.3 mm) or cellulose-cotton (2.3 mm). The control group remained untreated. The glycerin-oxalic acid strips made of cellulose and cotton (2.3 mm) showed the highest efficacy, reducing the mite infestation by 17.79% compared to the control. The glycerin-oxalic acid strips of paper-cellulose (2.3 mm) were also effective, achieving a 17.05% reduction in mite levels. These results provide valuable insights for beekeepers seeking alternative and sustainable methods for controlling Varroa destructor infestations."

      "abstract": "The current study describes the chemical profiles and biological activities of essential oils (EOs) from Ziziphus leucodermis stem and leaves for the first time. Higher quantity of β-eudesmol (1) was found in stem (43.4 ± 0.68%) compared to leave's oil, while leaves contained higher amounts of α-bergamotene (2, 13.5 ± 0.65%) and β-eudesmene (3, 7.4 ± 0.51%) compared to stem. Significant potential was shown by leave's oil having IC50 of 133.5 ± 0.80 µg/mL than stem's oil (IC50 = 210.4 ± 0.20 µg/mL) against breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells. Similarly, higher inhibition was observed by leave's oil (IC50 = 1.61 ± 0.08 µg/mL) than stem's oil (IC50 = 2.39 ± 0.10) against α-glucosidase enzyme, while stem (95.36 ± 2.10) determined higher carbonic anhydrase II activity than leaves (116.54 ± 0.86) compared to standards. Furthermore, only stem oil had significant antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) having MIC of 12.5 ± 0.2 and fungi (Candida albicans and Candida kruzei) with an equal concentration of 50.0 ± 0.4 mm. The compounds identified in the stem and leaves oils were docked with the active pocket of α-glucosidase enzyme. In conclusion, these EOs might be a natural source for the treatment of breast cancer, antimicrobial, and diabetes-related diseases."

Ever increasing antibiotic resistance due to biofilms has sparked a search for plant-based replacements. This study examines anti-biofilm potential of essential oils from lemon (Citrus limon), lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), and lavender (Lavandula officinalis) against 26 clinical isolates of E. coli. Essential oils (EOs) were extracted by using hydro-distillation and characterized by GC-MS and FT-IR. Biofilms were quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. The extracted essential oils had yields ranging from 1.37 to 1.45 (w/v). The main constituents were limonene (94%) in lemon, citral (42%) and ketones (9%) in lemongrass, and linalool (35%) and linalyl anthranilate (20%) in lavender EO. MICs and MBCs of EOs were in the range of 3.13-50 µg/ml. The oils under investigation exhibited notable biofilm inhibition and eradication properties. The percent inhibition and eradication varied between 6-89% and 3-82.25% (p < 0.0001), respectively. These findings suggest that essential oils from lemon, lemongrass, and lavender may offer a promising natural approach to combat E. coli biofilms and associated infections. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action and to explore their clinical applications."

The three EOs exerted antibacterial activity on the bacterial strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.1735 to 65.6263 µg/mL. When combined with antibiotics, the L. graveolens EO showed the highest resistance modulation for vancomycin (VA), nalidixic acid (NA), and chloramphenicol against S. aureus (MIC: 0.0347 µg/mL), E. faecalis (MIC: 0.0832 µg/mL), and P. aeruginosa (MIC: 0.0694 µg/mL). For the A. ludoviciana EO, resistance modulation was based on S. aureus-VA (MIC: 0.6525 µg/mL) and E. faecalis-NA (MIC: 0.3262 µg/mL). Thereby, C. bipinnatus EO did not show significant antibiotic resistance modulating activity. In conclusion, L. graveolens and A. ludoviciana EOs showed antibacterial activity and the greatest potential in inhibiting bacterial resistance to antibiotics. The dual activity of these EOs makes them a promising adjuvant in the treatment of diseases caused by multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria."

      "abstract": "Food safety and security are now among the most urgent problems to be resolved as the world's population continues to grow. Intensive agriculture is required to meet the demands of a growing population and guarantee greater agricultural yield. Chemical pesticides and fertilizers are an essential part of intensive farming. Their extensive use accelerates the depletion of other important and minor nutrients, resulting in poor soil fertility and nutritional imbalance. There are serious health and environmental hazards associated with several of these hazardous agricultural chemicals. In context, for the first time, this study represents an innovative experiment exploring the impact of exogenously applied k-carrageenan on plant growth, physiological parameters, phytochemical content, macronutrients, and essential oil percentage in Ocimum basilicum plants. The investigation assessed the effect of varying k-carrageenan levels; 0.30, 0.60, 0.90, and 1.20 mM versus untreated control. The findings revealed that all k-carrageenan treatments significantly enhanced growth indicators compared to the control. The phytochemical analysis demonstrated that foliar application of k-carrageenan, particularly at 1.20 mM, significantly enhanced total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total carbohydrate and essential oil percentage compared to the untreated control. O. basilicum essential oils show rich, nuanced flavors with higher levels of Methyl cinnamate, Camphor, trans-methyl cinnamate, Eucalyptol, Linalool, and β-Caryophyllene among treatments. Treatment effects were also observed in the macroelements content of Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). k-carrageenan-induced alterations were noted in the contents of essential oil compounds. These results suggest that k-carrageenan can be a growth-promoting agent and significantly enhance essential oil yield, particularly in O. basilicum plants.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium intracellulare (M. intracellulare) is a common, slow-growing opportunistic pathogen that can cause chronic pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections. Despite its rising incidence, standard treatments are often ineffective in eradicating M. intracellulare, leading to prolonged treatment and high recurrence rates, likely due to persistence of non-growing bacteria. Although essential oils are known for their antimicrobial properties, their effects on M. intracellulare, particularly in its non-growing phase, have not been well studied. METHODS: We screened 151 essential oils to assess their antimicrobial activity against stationary-phase non-growing M. intracellulare. Essential oils with significant activity were further evaluated at different concentrations by MIC and drug exposure tests. RESULTS: Thirty-four essential oils were found to have activity at 5000 µg/mL, with 18 showing effectiveness at 1250 µg/mL. Six essential oils, Ajwain, Oregano, Palmarosa, Thyme, Mountain Savory, and Litsea Cubeba had the highest activity, achieving 100% bacterial clearance after one day exposure. Carvacrol, the key active component of Ajwain, Oregano, Thyme, Mountain Savory, eradicated stationary-phase bacteria at 310 µg/mL concentration within one day, while citronellol, the active component of Palmarosa, at 630 µg/mL achieved complete clearance after three day exposure. CONCLUSIONS: We have newly identified several essential oils, including Ajwain, Oregano, Thyme, Mountain Savory, Palmarosa, and Litsea Cubeba and their active components such as carvacrol and citronellol, to have promising activity against M. intracellulare, and these findings may have implications for developing improved treatments for M. intracellulare infections.",

      "abstract": "Globally, poultry production has increased to meet the demand for animal protein. Traditionally, antibiotic growth promoters have been used to enhance growth performance and prevent infections in commercial poultry practices. However, concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance have triggered interest in alternative solutions, such as essential oils (EOs) and seaweed additives. The aim of the current study was to assess the impact of a microencapsulated blend of EOs (cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and thymol) and Ascophyllum nodosum seaweed meal on growth performance, intestinal function, blood biomarkers, and hepatic gene expression in broiler chickens. Four hundred and forty Arbor Acres chicks were randomly assigned to either a control (CON) or treatment (NEX) group. Each treatment was divided into 11 replicates (20 birds per replicate). NEX chicks were supplemented with 100 mg/kg feed containing a microencapsulated blend of EOs (cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and thymol) and Ascophyllum nodosum seaweed meal. Data were analyzed using the UNIVARIATE procedure in SAS software. Each replicate was considered an experimental unit. Over a 35-day period, NEX supplementation improved the feed conversion ratio (P = 0.02), reduced mortality rate (P = 0.01), and increased the European performance efficiency factor. No differences in carcass traits were observed between the two treatments (P > 0.05). Jejunal digestive enzyme activities, particularly those of amylase and lipase, were higher in NEX birds (P < 0.05) and correlated with morphometric parameters, such as villus height (P = 0.04) and muscular layer thickness (P < 0.01). Gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of key genes related to nutrient transporters (solute carrier family 5 member 1 gene (SLC5A1), solute carrier family 1 member 1 gene (SLC1A1), solute carrier family 15 member 1 gene (SLC15A1)) in the jejunum (P < 0.05) and lipid metabolism (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha gene (PPARA) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene (MTTP)) in the liver (P < 0.05) of NEX-supplemented birds. NEX treatment altered plasma biomarkers, including increased glucose (P < 0.01), insulin (P < 0.01), and protein profiles (P < 0.05) but decreased low density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.03), suggesting enhanced metabolic health. NEX supplementation improved the growth performance, economic efficiency, intestinal morphology, digestive enzyme activity, liver function, and metabolic biomarkers in broiler chickens."

      "abstract": "Otitis externa is common infection in dogs. Its most important aetiologic agent is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which, besides its ability to form biofilm, can also be resistant to several antibiotics, leading to therapeutic failures in several cases. Promising therapeutic alternatives are constantly being sought to treat chronic, recurrent infections. Within the framework of this study, we investigated the antibacterial potential of essential oils against canine isolates of P. aeruginosa. Forty P. aeruginosa were isolated from individual dogs' otitis externa. They were identified by MALDI-TOF MS, their antibiotic susceptibility was determined with disk diffusion, and their genetic relatedness was established using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Fifty-seven essential oils were screened for their antipseudomonas effects using the drop plate method, and six essential oils-cinnamon (bark and leaf), bay, rosemary, thyme, and bitter orange-were further tested for their mature-biofilm-degrading capacities at 30 °C and 37 °C. Even though the molecular relatedness of the forty P. aeruginosa isolates could be excluded, all isolates' growth was inhibited and their biofilms degraded by a 2.5% concentration of cinnamon (bark and leaf), bay, rosemary, thyme, or bitter orange essential oil. Our results show that essential oils are potent alternatives in the treatment of otitis externa."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cupressus sempervirens is one of the conifer plants, that is used as an antimicrobial, antioxidant, anthelminthic, and many other health purposes. Rhipicephalus annulatus is one of the hard tick genera affecting the production and health of domestic animals in Egypt. Extensive use of chemical acaricides in the management of ticks caused acaricide resistance, environmental contamination, residues in meat and milk, and harmful effects on non-target species. For these reasons, there is an urgent need to create efficient, environmentally friendly acaricides. This work aimed to assay the essential oils and establish the phytochemical analysis of C. sempervirens extract, its effects against the semi-engorged females of R. annulatus, and discuss their possible control effects. RESULTS: Using the spray-dip method by C. sempervirens ethanol, methanol, distal water, and chloroform extracts at different concentrations (10-50%), revealed a decrease in the percentage of mobile female R. annulatius ticks, and increased mortality proportionally with days after treatments (14 days) and/or extract concentrations (10-50%). The ethanol extracts showed their strongest acaricidal effect, where the female mortality percentage reached 100% using all concentrations at the end of the examined period. In addition, the estimated LC50 and LC95 of C. sempervirens ethanolic extract were recorded as the lowest values (12.2% and 17%, respectively) after 14 days of treatment compared with other extract types. The 50% ethanolic extract of C. sempervirens (the most effective one) revealed the presence of bioactive metabolites i.e. flavonoids, tannins, and carbohydrates (TSS). Also, its total antioxidant capacity and potential free-radical activity (DPPH) were estimated. Using GC-MS, the extracted oil revealed the presence of four major compounds i.e., Eicosapentaenoic acid (50.85%), 10,12-Docosadiynedioic acid (27.58%),10-Undecynoic acid (14.28%) and Palmitic acid (5.42%). The efficiency of all phytochemicals and essential oils was discussed in the current study. CONCLUSION: The phytochemicals and essential oils found in C. sempervirens could enhance our understanding and help in developing potential strategies for controlling ticks in general and for R. annulatus, in particular, using environmentally friendly agents.",

The goal was to determine the optimal formulation for stable microemulsions and assess their potential as innovative drug delivery systems for the antidiabetic drug repaglinide. METHODS: Initial phase diagrams were constructed to identify the optimal ratios of oil, water, surfactant (Tween 80), and cosurfactant (ethanol) for producing stable microemulsions. The physical attributes of the resulting formulations, such as droplet size, zeta potential, and morphology, were characterized using transmission electron microscopy. Drug release profiles of microemulsions containing repaglinide were evaluated using the dialysis method. Moreover, vivo studies were conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of cardamom oil microemulsions compared to standard commercial repaglinide formulations. RESULTS: Microemulsions exhibited suitable properties with optimal particle size, well-defined spherical droplets, and optimized zeta potential. Drug release studies indicated that cardamom oil-based microemulsions demonstrated superior release characteristics, providing a more sustained and controlled release of repaglinide compared to microemulsions containing black seed or olive oil. In vivo studies revealed a significant improvement in antidiabetic outcomes with cardamom oil microemulsions over standard commercial repaglinide formulations. The enhanced efficacy was attributed to improved bioavailability and the controlled release properties of the drug. CONCLUSION: This research underscores the potential of cardamom oil-based microemulsions as effective antidiabetic drug delivery systems. With superior physicochemical properties and controlled release profiles, they promise innovative treatment options for diabetes, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes for patients.",

In Exp. 1756 pigs (Duroc × Landrace/Large White composite (Smithfield Premium Genetics), initially 7.8 ± 0.09 kg) were used in a 40-d study to determine the effects of CCG level on growth performance of nursery pigs fed pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. In Exp. 2340 barrows (DNA 200 × 400, initially 6.1 ± 0.08 kg) were used in 38-d study to determine the effect of CCG in diets with or without pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu on growth performance and fecal dry matter (DM). For both experiments, pigs were randomly allotted to pens which were allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments in a completely randomized design. There were 9 pigs per pen and 21 pens per treatment in Exp. 1 and 5 pigs per pen and 17 pens per treatment in Exp. 2. Dietary treatments in Exp. 1 were corn-soybean meal based with pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu and included either 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg of CCG. Dietary treatments in Exp. 2 were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial with main effects of CCG (none or 100 mg/kg) and nutritional or pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. All Exp. 2 diets contained 110 mg/kg of Zn and 16.5 mg/kg of Cu from the trace mineral premix. For both experiments, pharmacological levels of Zn were added at 3,000 and 2,000 mg/kg in phase 1 and 2, respectively and Cu was added at 250 mg/kg in all phases. For Exp. 1, overall average daily gain (ADG) increased (linear, P < 0.05) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) tended to increase (linear, P < 0.10) as CCG increased from 0 to 100 mg/kg. For Exp. 2, there was a CCG × Zn/Cu interaction observed for overall ADG and ADFI (P < 0.05) where CCG numerically increased ADG and ADFI in pigs fed nutritional levels of Zn and Cu; but reduced ADG and ADFI in pigs fed pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu. There was a Zn/Cu × day interaction (P = 0.001) for fecal DM, in which there was no difference (P > 0.10) in fecal DM on d 10, but pigs fed pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu had lower (P < 0.001) fecal DM on d 21 compared to pigs fed nutritional levels of Zn and Cu. In summary, when included in diets with pharmacological levels of Zn and Cu, feeding increasing levels of CCG increased ADG in Exp. 1 but did not improve performance in Exp 2."

      "abstract": "The formation of biofilm by foodborne pathogens increases the risk of foodborne diseases, resulting in major health risks. Research on strategies for eliminating biofilm formation by foodborne pathogens is urgently needed. Therefore, the objective of this study was to construct a new technique for controlling foodborne bacteria and inhibiting the biosynthesis of biofilm via using natural products. The essential orange oil (EOO) and cell-free filtrate of Lactobacillus pentosus RS2 were used as antibacterial and antibiofilm agents against B. cereus RS1, the strongest biofilm-forming strain. The mixture of cell-free filtrate (CFF) and EOO (CFF/EOO) was the best antibiofilm agent under all tested conditions. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test revealed that 400 μl ml-1 CFF and 16 μl ml-1 EOO completely inhibited the growth of B. cereus. The treatment of three commercial surfaces with CFF/EOO resulted in a high reduction in biofilm synthesis, with adhesion percentages of 33.3, 36.3, and 40.8% on stainless steel, aluminum foil, and aluminum, respectively. The aluminum surface had the greatest adhesion with B. cereus RS1 among the three tested surfaces. These results were confirmed by expression analysis of three essential coding genes, sinR, calY, and spo0A, participating in biofilm formation in B. cereus. The biofilm-negative regulator gene sinR was overexpressed, whereas the biofilm-positive regulator genes calY and spo0A were down-expressed in B. cereus RS1 after treatment with antibiofilm agents, compared with those in the untreated sample. This study revealed that CFF/EOO was more effective at activating sinR (2.099 ± 0.167-fold increase) and suppressing calY and spo0A (0.314 ± 0.058 and0.238 ± 0.04-fold decrease, respectively) compared to control. This result confirmed the biochemical estimation of biofilm formation in B. cereus after treatment with all the experimental agents. The EOO and CFF of L. pentosus RS2 can be used as strong antibacterial and antibiofilm agents against foodborne bacteria. These products reduced the biofilm formation on trade surfaces affecting the expression of three essential biofilm regulatory genes. This study considered novel research concerning the potential antibiofilm activity of EOO combined with CFF of L. pentosus and the molecular analysis of genes regulating biofilm production under stress of CFF/EOO.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be managed by inhibiting amylolytic enzymes, α-amylase and α-glucosidase, reducing the impact of dietary carbohydrates on blood glucose elevation. Acarbose, a current α-glucose inhibitor (AGI), has excessive α-amylase inhibition, resulting in side effects associated with large amounts of undigested starch being fermented in the colon. This study evaluated the AGI efficacy of citrus peel-derived essential oils, where they were first tested in silico against the target amylolytic enzymes, and then their AGI activity was tested in vitro. The synergistic effects of the essential oils with acarbose against amylolytic enzymes were also determined. In silico and in vitro data of the efficacy of the essential oils as AGIs correlated positively; lower Ki values correlated with more negative binding affinity. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulations of the most potent compounds were evaluated and indicated relative flexibility and stability induced upon ligand interactions with the protein. The standard AGI drug, acarbose, had the lowest Ki (0.10 ± 0.01 mg/mL) and more negative binding affinity (-7.5 kcal/mol) than the essential oils for α-glucosidase; however, the essential oils only showed potent inhibition against α-glucosidase, with the most potent essential oils being valencene (Ki = 0.33 ± 0.04 mg/mL), carveol (Ki = 0.53 ± 0.02 mg/mL) and geraniol (Ki = 0.56 ± 0.02 mg/mL). The essential oils and acarbose displayed competitive inhibition of α-glucosidase. Furthermore, a combination of acarbose with carveol or geraniol at a ratio of 12.5 μg/mL: 2 mg/mL exhibited antagonistic (CI > 10) and synergistic (CI < 0.7) effects on α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition, respectively. Carveol or geraniol can be considered as potentially therapeutic in managing T2D, as it may display lowered AGI-associated side effects."

Thirty finishing steers (441 kg body weight, 34.3 months old) consuming a TMR were blocked by BW and randomly assigned to three treatments according to the addition of (1) EOTB (ANAVRIN® at 0.35 g/100 kg body weight), (2) MON (monensin at 0.033 g/kg dry matter), and (3) EOTB + MON (at the same dose as in (1) and (2). A 60-day feeding trial was conducted, including a 19-day adaptation period. Data collected included daily dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and rumen fermentation parameters (pH, NH3-N, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations). EOTB resulted in higher DMI compared to EOTB + MON, while no significant differences were observed in ADG or FCR. The ruminal pH and NH3-N concentrations were similar among treatments, but there were interactions among treatment × hour for VFAs. The EOTB + MON led to a more stable VFA concentration in rumen, suggesting possible complementary supplementation effects. However, more studies are needed to confirm this and to go deeper into the underlying mechanism of action."

Plant-derived essential oils (EO) are one of the promising strategies for nematode management showing high nematicidal potential. Very little is known about the molecular mechanisms activated by EOs in M. incognita. In our study, we assessed the effects of Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Citrus aurantium and the chemical nematicide Oxamyl on the mortality of M. incognita juveniles (J2) at different doses and exposure. The toxicity of C. zeylanicum and C. aurantium EOs to M. incognita J2 was largely different, peaking 94.7 and 26.7% mortality rates after a 24-hour exposure to 100 µg mL- 1 EO concentrations, respectively. The different nematicidal activity of the two EOs was also confirmed by their LC50 values, ranging between 0.1 and 399 mg mL- 1 concentrations for the 24-hour treatment, respectively.The sublethal dose (0.78 µg mL- 1), the concentration that does not cause mortality but still triggers physiological responses, was chosen for both EOs and Oxamyl to investigate the expression levels of Mi-ace-1, Mi-ace-2, and Mi-hsp90, involved in host finding processes, and Mi-far-1, involved in the cuticle protection, by using real time PCR. Our results reveal that C. zeylanicum is toxic at lower doses than C. aurantium. The different expression level of Mi-far-1 in J2s treated with C. zeylanicum suggests a different action mode compared to C. aurantium and Oxamyl. Understanding the action mode of these compounds at molecular level will help to develop more potent and effective nematicides safer for environment and humans.",

The aim of this study was to test new binary associations between known and uncommon EOs. Methods: EOs from Origanum vulgare L., Juniperus communis L., Cistus ladaniferus L., Citrus aurantium L. var. amara were tested individually and in binary combinations to study, as follows: antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli; antioxidant capacity via redox-based assays (DPPH, ABTS and FRAP); and anti-inflammatory activity via the bovine serum albumin denaturation inhibition assay. Results: O. vulgare L. showed good antibacterial activity against all strains (MIC = 0.03-0.12%, v/v), followed by C. ladaniferus L., and also had the best antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Synergistic and additive effects were observed for the EO combinations O. vulgare L./C. ladaniferus L. and O. vulgare L./J. communis L. against S. aureus and MRSA, respectively. A reduction in biofilm was noted. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were also detected.

      "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of acute traumas, surgical wounds, and chronic skin wounds poses significant therapeutic challenges for wound treatment. One of the main concerns in wound care is the danger of infection, which is a significant barrier to healing and a cause of higher morbidity and mortality rates. The emergence of drug-resistant bacterial species is becoming more frequent every day. Antimicrobial dressings have become a viable strategy for wound healing and hospital expense savings. Several factors, such as the wound's localization and state, microbial load, and cost, must be considered when choosing an appropriate antimicrobial dressing. One of the key goals of wound care is infection avoidance. This study addresses the therapeutic challenges of acute traumas, surgical wounds, and chronic skin wounds, focusing on infection prevention and combating drug-resistant bacterial strains. The research explores the development of novel composite wound dressings incorporating hydroxyapatite, known for its osteoconductive properties, and essential oils from basil and cinnamon, recognized for their antimicrobial activity. The study evaluates the impact of these additives on key properties such as surface morphology, water absorption, enzymatic degradation, and mechanical performance. Antimicrobial tests showed that two experimental samples (A1S and A1BS) exhibited significant activity against Escherichia coli but not on Staphylococcus aureus. The results highlight the dressings' enhanced antimicrobial properties, mechanical strength, and controlled degradation, making them promising candidates for advanced wound healing. Tailored applications were identified, with each dressing composition offering unique benefits for specific wound-healing scenarios based on the balance between flexibility, structural support, and bioactivity."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease, a type of dementia, poses serious challenges to patients, especially older people, and no definitive treatment is available for this disease, with drug treatments having many side effects. As essential oils of plants deserve particular attention in the treatment of diseases, this study aimed to review the potential therapeutic effects of essential oils on treatment of psychosomatic aspects of Alzheimer's disease. To collect information, we searched different databases, including MagIran, SID, IranDoc and IranMedex, Embase, Science Direct, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science using the keywords of essential oil, Alzheimer, acetylcholinesterase, memory, forgetfulness, aromatherapy, medicinal plant, herbal drugs, and their Persian equivalents from January 2010 to June 2022; the search included both single and multiple keywords. We retrieved 233 articles, reviewed the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the articles, and then included 25 related articles in this review (11 in vitro studies and 14 in vivo studies). The study results of in vitro and in vivo studies showed the effectiveness of different essential oils such as salvia family, tangerine and lemon oils, Juniperus communis, Anthriscus nemorosa, olibanum, inhaled coriander, Schisandra chinensis, lavender, rose essential oil, Nepeta cataria, Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Lippia origanoides, on memory and learning, enzymes, oxidative stress and inflammation, behavioural and cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that essential oils can serve as complementary therapies for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and for addressing memory impairments, although further research, especially human clinical trials, is needed to validate these findings, determine optimal dosages, and explore the long-term safety of essential oils in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Pyomelanogenic P. aeruginosa, frequently isolated from patients with urinary tract infections and cystic fibrosis, possesses the ability to withstand oxidative stress, contributing to virulence and resulting in persistent infections. Whole genome sequence analysis of U804, a pyomelanogenic, multidrug-resistant, clinical isolate, demonstrates the mechanism underlying pyomelanin overproduction. Seven essential oils (EOs) were screened for pyomelanin inhibition. Garlic, cinnamon and thyme EOs were selected for further studies based on their significant anti-virulent properties, like inhibition of pyomelanin production and biofilm formation. Additionally, downregulation of the expression of virulence genes regulated by quorum sensing (QS) and a decrease in levels of the QS signaling molecule, C12-HSL, were also observed. The EO treatment inhibited the survival of U804 in human blood and increased survival of C. elegans, a whole animal model of pathogenesis. EO treatment also resulted in a significant reduction of efflux pump activity, indicative of their effect on antibiotic sensitization. Garlic oil enhanced the permeability of the bacterial membrane, resulting in decreased survival, when combined with sub-MIC concentrations of colistin. This study demonstrates that thyme, cinnamon and garlic EOs can attenuate pyomelanogenic P. aeruginosa virulence traits. Additionally, garlic potentiates drug sensitivity, suggesting its promising therapeutic use in combating pyomelanogenic MDR infections.",

      "abstract": "The urgent need to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance in multidrug-resistant bacteria requires the development of pioneering approaches to treatment. The present study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the essential oils (EOs) of Moringa oleifera (moringa), Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon), and Nigella sativa (black seed) and the synergistic effect of the mixture of these oils against Staphylococcus aureus MCC 1351. Statistical modeling revealed cinnamon oil had the highest individual antimicrobial potency, followed by black seed oil. The combination of the three EOs exhibited significant synergistic effects compared to the individual oils, with a Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (∑FIC) index of 0.27. L-Optimal mixture design of response surface methodology (RSM) identified the optimal mixture as moringa: cinnamon: black seed oils by the ratio of (1:1:1) in run 15 (0.338:0.307:0.355 mL) (v/v). This mixture exhibited significant antibacterial efficacy, outperforming individual oils and conventional antibiotics like tetracycline. Specifically, the combination reduced the MIC values from 3.12, 0.78, and 6.25 to 0.25, 0.06, and 0.78 μg/mL for moringa, cinnamon, and black seed oil, respectively. Synergistic interactions between oils further boosted efficacy, with moringa-cinnamon and cinnamon-black seed pairings exhibiting the strongest synergies. The developed predictive models for IZD and MIC showed excellent fit, with R2 values of 0.9843 and 0.9958, respectively. Pareto chart analysis highlighted the predominant individual and synergistic effects, with the Moringa-Cinnamon interaction exhibiting the highest positive synergy. Notably, the oil mixture of run 15 demonstrated excellent biocompatibility, maintaining 97.6% viability of normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF) after 24 h exposure to 200 μL EOs of the mixture per mL. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) identified abundant bioactive phytochemicals like cinnamaldehyde, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid methyl esters underlying the observed antimicrobial effects. This rationally designed, synergistic phytochemical combination presents a promising natural therapeutic against antibiotic-resistant S. aureus while exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity. The results underscore how combining essential oils could help address the issue of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus."

      "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the combined antimicrobial activity of selected phage cocktail (MS2+T7 phages) and essential oils (cinnamon, clove, oregano, and thymol) against Escherichia coli ATCC 15597. To select most effective phages, the lytic abilities of individual phages (MS2, phiX174, and T7) and their phage combinations were assessed using the phage spot test and plaque assay at various multiplicity of infections (MOIs) ranging from 0.01 to 100. The inhibitory effectiveness of selected phage combinations (MS2+T7), treated with and without essential oils (cinnamon, clove, oregano, and thymol; 1/2 × MIC each), against E. coli hosts was evaluated at various MOIs of 0, 0.1, and 1. The antimicrobial effect of phage cocktail (MS2+T7) combined with cinnamon (1/2 × MIC) and thymol (1/2 × MIC) were evaluated using time-kill curve assay for 48 h at 37°C. The 48-h treated cells, including the control, cinnamon, thymol, phage cocktail, and cinnamon-phage cocktail, and thymol-phage cocktail, were further tested for relative fitness, and phage mutant frequency assays. The highest lytic activity of MS2 and T7 phages was observed against E. coli (>6 log reduction) at an MOI of 0.1. The phage combination (MS2+T7) was considerably reduced the number of E. coli by 7 logs (p < 0.05). The lytic activity of MS2+T7 was significantly enhanced in the presence of cinnamon, clove, oregano, and thymol (1/2 × MIC each) after 24-h incubation at 37°C. The combinations of cinnamon-phage cocktail and thymol-phage cocktail effectively reduced the numbers of E. coli by more than 5 log CFU/mL compared to the control after 48 h of incubation at 37°C. The lowest relative fitness (<0.5) and mutant frequency (<10 %) were observed for E. coli treated with the combinations. These findings suggest that combining phage cocktails with essential oils can serve as synergistic antimicrobial agents. Consequently, this study provides valuable insights for developing effective phage therapy strategies and ensuring the sustained effectiveness of phage treatments.",

Eugenol and methyl eugenol/terbinafine T-GNEs had an additive efficacy, while carvacrol (CT-GNE) worked synergistically with terbinafine, providing effective antifungal treatment with minimal mammalian cell toxicity. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that CT-GNE penetrated the dense C. albicans biofilm and disrupted the fungal cell membrane.

In this study, the chemical compositions of five CPEOs were analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). CCK8 assays were used to evaluate the ability of five CPEOs to inhibit U251 human glioblastoma cells, and XLB and RA were selected for further investigation. Through wound healing assays and cell cycle and apoptosis analyses via flow cytometry, it was revealed that these CPEOs inhibited cell migration, arrested the cell cycle at G1/G0, and induced apoptosis with similar levels of inhibition. After CPEOs treatment, the intracellular Ca2+ content and reactive oxygen species levels in U251 cells increased significantly, whereas the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased. Additionally, the antioxidant enzyme system (SOD, POD, CAT, and GR) and the nonenzymatic defense system (GSH) were inhibited, leading to an increase in lipid peroxidation. qRT-PCR indicated the significant upregulation of intracellular calcium ion signaling pathways and the upregulation of mitochondrial apoptosis-related genes. Additionally, the activation of calcicoptosis-related indicators induced by the CPEOs could be reversed by inhibitor treatment, confirming that both of the selected CPEOs inhibit tumors by activating calcicoptosis-related pathways. These findings highlight the immense potential of CPEOs in healthcare and pharmaceutical applications by not only providing a scientific basis for the potential application of CPEOs in the treatment of glioblastoma but also offering new insights for the development of novel antitumor drugs."

In addition to oral medications and some physical therapies, aromatherapy can help overcome some treatment-related side effects. Herein, parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA)-induced insomnia was established in Kunming (KM) mice, which were subjected to aromatherapy using five plants (Jasminum sambac, Magnolia denudata, Rosa rugosa, Aloysia citriodora, and Abies balsamea) essential oils (EOs). To determine the sleep-inducing effect of the five EOs, the rate of change in body weight, sleep latency, and total sleep time in mice were measured. Specific serum indices were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the tested drugs and PCPA modeling. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to identify active components in EOs. The five EOs contained multiple identical constituents and were rich in terpenoids, such as α-farnesene (28.42%), linalool (68.84%), and citronellol (23.78%). The EOs exhibiting varying effects on insomnia-induced weight loss. Nissl staining was used to examine and the number of neurons was elevated in the EO-treated groups when compared with the PCPA-induced group; however, the neuronal number was reduced in the hypothalamic tissues of the R. rugosa EO (RREO)-treated group. All EOs upregulated the expression of 5-HT1A and GABAARα1, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR results. In addition, EOs of A. citriodora and A. balsamea significantly upregulated the expression of 5HT1A protein, whereas EOs of J. sambac and M. denudata exerted significantly different effects when compared with the model group, as determined by western blotting.",

      "abstract": "AIM AND OBJECTIVE: Magnoliae Flos (Chinese name: Xin-Yi) and Xanthii Fructus (Chinese name: Cang-Er-Zi) are Chinese herbal medicines and have been used to treat allergic rhinitis (AR). However, the therapeutic effect, active ingredients, and probable processes of a compound of Magnoliae Flos and Xanthii Fructus in the form of essential oils (CMFXFEO) in treating AR have not been reported. This study aims to determine the efficacy of the CMFXFEO on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR in a rat model and to use network pharmacology and molecular docking to reveal the hub genes, biological functions, and signaling pathways of CMFXFEO against AR. METHODS: Animal experiments were applied to validate the role of CMFXFEO in the treatment of AR. 20 rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (CON, n=5), positive control group (AR, n=5), CMFXFEO-treated group (AR+CMFXFEO, n=5), and budesonide-treated group (AR+Budesonide, n=5). Rats were stimulated with OVA to induce AR. Symptom scores assessment and histo-pathomorphological evaluation was performed. The serum level of OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E was measured. Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer analysis (GC-MS) was used to identify the monomer chemical composition of CMFXFEO. The target genes of CMFXFEO were obtained by using PubChem and SwissTargetPrediction databases. The target genes of AR were screened using GeneCards, DisGeNET, and OMIM databases. The target genes were intersected using the venny2.1 website to obtain the potential therapeutic targets of CMFXFEO for treating AR and to construct the PPI network. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were used to reveal associated signaling pathways. The Sybyl tool was used to dock the CMFXFEO with key therapeutic targets molecularly. RESULTS: Intranasal CMFXFEO administration significantly suppressed the allergic symptoms, reduced the inflammatory cell infiltration, and the serum level of OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E. The main components of CMFXFEO obtained through the GC-MS analysis, listed as γ-terpinene (9.4908%), limonene (7.2693%), menthol (7.1821%), β-pinene (7.1190%), β-caryophyllene (7.0396%), eucalyptol (6.1367%), linalool(5.9686%), eugenol (5.0776%). A total of 398 CMFXFEO targets and 488 AR-related targets were screened, of which 42 were common targets. The GO and KEGG pathway analyses unveiled that CMFXFEO were strongly associated with several signaling pathways, including the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and Chemokine signaling pathway. PPI network construction screened six hub genes as therapeutic targets, including STAT3, IL1B, TLR4, PTGS2, ICAM1, and VCAM1. The molecular docking verification indicated that CMFXFEO have good binding activity with therapeutic targets, and β-Pinene's docking ability with TLR4 is particularly prominent. CONCLUSION: The anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects of CMFXFEO are to inhibit the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the OVA-induced AR rat model. The results of the network pharmacology and molecular docking deduced that the CMFXFEO may have the potential to treat AR by multiple pathways through relieving inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress response, and modulating the immune system."

Six probiotic strains and various extracts/EOs were evaluated in a large screening to evaluate their potential against both pathogens. Lacticaseibacillus paracasei PCB003 was able to inhibit the growth of both pathogens. For extracts/EOs, Oregano EO had the best antipathogenic effects on both pathogens and did not show any adverse impact on the growth of probiotics, making it suitable for simultaneous use. Using Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PCB011 as a probiotic model, five material formulations were assessed for their suitability to protect probiotic cells within freeze-dried topical patches. Alginate and trehalose (ALG+TRE) and thermoplastic starch (TPS) had the highest probiotic survivability, with ALG+TRE chosen as the final patch material as it was more robust. PCB003 and PCB011 were individually incorporated into the ALG+TRE freeze-dried matrix to form a 6 mm patch; both ALG+TRE (PCB003) and ALG+TRE (PCB011) patches, when used individually, successfully inhibited C. acnes growth by 4.7 and 6.0 mm, respectively, surpassing the performance of commercially available acne patches. The additive effect with 30% Oregano EO further improved pathogen inhibition. For S. aureus, the incorporation of 30% Oregano EO to ALG+TRE (PCB003) increased the size of the inhibition zone more than 10-fold. For C. acnes, the ALG+TRE (PCB003) patch with 30% Oregano EO demonstrated an inhibition zone of 16.3 mm, and the ALG+TRE (PCB011) patch with 30% Oregano EO achieved a 14.3 mm inhibition zone. Genomic analysis confirmed that PCB003 and PCB011 lack antimicrobial resistance determinants, ensuring safety. This study successfully combined probiotics and natural agents to create effective dermatological antipathogenic patches.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementing drinking water with apple vinegar and essential oils, compared to an antibiotic growth promoter, on the growth performance, serum lipid profile, antioxidant status, intestinal morphology, and gastrointestinal microflora population of broiler chickens. A total of 240 one-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly assigned to four treatments, each consisting of six replicate pens with ten birds per pen. The broiler chickens received the following experimental treatments: normal drinking water without additives (control) and drinking water supplemented with antibiotic (0.25 ml/L), apple vinegar (1 ml/L), and essential oils blend (0.5 ml/L). The results showed that adding antibiotic or essential oils blend to drinking water improved body weight gain and feed conversion ratio throughout the entire rearing period (P < 0.05). The serum levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein in broilers that received apple vinegar or essential oils blend were lower than those in the control and antibiotic groups (P < 0.05). The essential oils blend treatment significantly increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in the serum of broiler chickens compared to the other treatments (P < 0.05). Furthermore, adding essential oils blend to the drinking water increased villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in the jejunum of broilers (P < 0.05). The broiler chickens in the apple vinegar and essential oil blend groups also exhibited a lower population of Enterobacteriaceae and a higher count of lactic acid bacteria in the ceca (P < 0.05). In summary, the addition of essential oils blend to the drinking water of broiler chickens has beneficial effects on production performance and can serve as an effective alternative to antibiotic growth promoters.",

      "abstract": "Tuta absoluta is one of the most destructive pests of tomatoes. Chemical insecticides used to control this leafminer harm all organisms, increasing the risk to public health and the environment. Developing natural alternatives, such as bioinsecticides formulated from essential plant oils, is a key strategy to address this problem. These volatile compounds, derived from the secondary metabolic pathways of plants, exhibit targeted activity against specific pest species. Their use is consistent with an environmentally responsible framework that reduces adverse impacts on ecosystems, protects non-target organisms, safeguards human health, and enhances the efficacy of integrated crop management systems. This study aims to determine the chemical composition of the essential oils (EOs) of from round leaf mint (Mentha rotundifolia) and crown chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum coronarium) and to evaluate their toxicity to T. absoluta larvae in-vitro. The chemical composition of EOs obtained by steam distillation from the leaves of the plants was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Indeed, 77 volatile compounds representing 98.19% of the total oil of M. rotundifolia, including cyclobutane acetonitrile, 1-methyl-2-(1-methyl ethenyl)-, terpinene-4-ol, p-menthane, germacrene D, caryophyllene and myrcene, were the main compounds. However, farnesene, myrcene, eugenol, germacrene D, phytol, and pinene were significant components among 69 compounds representing 95.39% of the total oil of C. coronarium. Results showed that the EOs were toxic to the different larval stages. According to the Finney method, concentrations 2.88 and 1.07% are the LC50 of M. rotundifolia and C. coronarium oils, which induce 50% mortality of T. absoluta within 7 days of exposure. Statistical analysis of in-vitro tests showed that both EOs had a similar level of insecticidal efficacy by contact. The overall results showed that the oils used have been shown to have an important insecticidal effect and can be used as a source of biological and natural treatment against tomato leafminer (TLM).",

      "abstract": "This study examined the effects of supplementing dairy cows with a mixture of essential oils on enteric CH4 emissions, apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility, N utilization, and lactational performance (production, components, and efficiency). Thirty-two multiparous lactating Holstein cows were used in a randomized complete block design. Cows averaged (mean ± SD) 95 ± 15.4 DIM, 47.7 ± 4.51 kg milk yield, and 698 ± 68.2 kg BW at the start of the experiment. The experiment consisted of a 3-wk pretreatment period (i.e., covariate), followed by a 3-wk adaptation to the experimental treatments, and a 10-wk period for data and sample collection. At the beginning of the study, milk yield and DIM data were used to block the cows into 16 blocks of 2 cows each. Subsequently, the blocks were adjusted based on milk yield and enteric CH4 emission data collected during the pretreatment period. Within each block, cows were assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments: (1) a basal diet supplemented with a placebo (control, no additive), or (2) a basal diet with the essential oil supplement (Agolin, 1 g/cow per day). The basal diet (i.e., TMR) was composed of 69.3% forage (corn and alfalfa silage and grass hay) and 30.7% concentrate, on a DM basis, and the essential oil mixture consisted mainly of coriander seed oil, eugenol, geraniol, and geranyl acetate. Twice daily, the essential oil supplement was thoroughly mixed with 50 g of a commercial protein supplement (i.e., carrier) and 500 g of the TMR and this premix (i.e., 550 g/meal) was offered to the cow before the basal diet. No interactions between the essential oil supplement and the sampling week were observed for any of the response variables. Dry matter intake, apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility and N balance were unaffected by feeding the essential oil supplement. Yields of milk, 4% FCM, and ECM were not modified by the experimental treatment. Neither feed efficiency (kg milk/kg DMI, kg 4% FCM/kg DMI, kg ECM/kg DMI) nor dietary N use efficiency in milk N secretion (i.e., g milk N/g N intake) were affected by essential oil supplementation. Body weight change and BCS did not differ between cows fed the essential oil supplement versus cows fed the control. Daily enteric CH4 production, CH4 yield, and CH4 intensity averaged 498 g/d, 18.4 g/kg of DMI, and 11.0 g/kg of ECM, respectively, and were unchanged by essential oil supplementation. We conclude that supplementing cows fed a high-forage diet with 1 g/d of this essential oil mixture did not positively affect lactational performance, nutrient digestibility, and N utilization, or reduce enteric CH4 (production, yield, and intensity). More research is needed to identify the optimal dose of this essential oil mixture and elucidate how it may interact with the basal diet to improve the mixture's efficacy.",

This study investigates the antibacterial efficacy of seven citrus EOs against six spoilage bacteria: Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. harveyi, Photobacterium damselae, Shewanella putrefaciens, Carnobacterium divergens, and Lactobacillus pentosus. The antibacterial activity of these EOs was evaluated using solid- and vapor-phase applications. All tested EOs demonstrated effective antibacterial activity at a concentration of 294 μL/L against Gram-negative bacteria. Notably, lemon and orange EOs exhibited dose-dependent inhibition in both solid- and vapor-phase applications, with minimum effective concentrations ranging from 29.4 to 58.8 μL/L. Following treatment with lemon and orange EOs for 6 h at 1/4 minimum inhibitory concentration, leakage of intracellular DNA and proteins was observed, indicating damage to the cell membrane/wall. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct mechanisms: lemon EO impaired bacterial antioxidant defenses, while orange EO disrupted cell division, leading to reduced bacterial viability. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential of different EO application forms in controlling spoilage bacteria."

The results showed that CPEOs could increase the activity of the antioxidant enzyme system and nonenzymatic defence system in H2O2-treated RAW 264.7 cells by reducing cellular lipid peroxidation. CPEOs also reduced the nitric oxide production induced by lipopolysaccharide treatment in RAW 264.7 cells while decreasing proinflammatory cytokines expression and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. Wound healing assays, flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that CPEOs could induce apoptosis in U87 cells through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. These findings indicate that CPEOs possess excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activity potential, making them suitable for use in functional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory foods and nutritional health products."

Twenty-four male Holstein calves (approximately five days old) were suckled for 60 days, underwent a weaning process, and were followed up until day 75 of the experiment. The calves were divided into control (n = 12) and phytobiotic (n = 12) groups, receiving commercial milk replacer and pelleted concentrate ad libitum. For the phytobiotic group, we added the blend to the liquid diet twice daily at 5 mL/feeding in the first 15 days and 10 mL/feeding until day 60. We detected no differences in weight gain, but animals in the phytobiotic group tended to consume less feed. Calves treated with phytobiotics showed better conversion and feed efficiency than the animals in the control group. Lower leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were observed, as was a higher cholesterol concentration. Immunoglobulin A, ceruloplasmin, and transferrin also differed between groups, with higher IgA and lower levels of acute-phase proteins (ceruloplasmin and transferrin) in calves that consumed the phytobiotic. Higher glutathione S-transferase activity was found in the serum of calves in the treatment group. The intestinal microbiota did not differ between the groups; however, the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Psychrobacter were the most abundant regardless of treatment. We concluded that the blend of oils based on cinnamon, oregano, and eucalyptus improved the calves' immune and antioxidant systems, improving feed efficiency without affecting the intestinal microbiota."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In Moroccan traditional medicine, plants from the Apiaceae family are widely utilized in folk medicine to treat various diseases associated with the digestive system. Ammodaucus leucotrichus plays an important role as an antispasmodic that has been traditionally used, especially to treat digestive tract diseases in children. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this research was to verify the traditional use by assessing the relaxant and spasmolytic activities of A. leucotrichus essential oil (ALEO) and then comparing them to the effects and potency of the major constituent of ALEO, which is perillaldehyde. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro evaluation of ALEO's relaxant and spasmolytic effects was carried out on isolated rats and rabbit jejunum in an organ bath setup. Intestinal contractility was recorded using an isotonic transducer connected to an amplifier. GC/MS analysis was conducted to identify components within ALEO. Subsequently, these compounds underwent in silico absorption, toxicity, and molecular docking studies. RESULTS: GC/MS analysis of this essential oil studied revealed seven compounds, which account for 98.67% of the oil, with the dominance of two compounds, namely, perillaldehyde (91.12%) and limonene (6.33%). ALEO and its main compound, perillaldehyde, reversibly relaxed the basal tone of rabbit jejunum, with the IC50 values 158.68 ± 13.89 and 95.03 ± 0.93 μg/mL, respectively. Moreover, ALEO caused a dose-dependent spasmolytic effect on Carbachol (CCh) and KCl provoked jejunum contraction in rats. Furthermore, the decrease in contractions of pre-contracted jejunum by CCh was more pronounced for perillaldehyde compared to ALEO, with an IC50 value of 68.59 ± 6.57 μg/mL, which was half compared to that of ALEO. The pre-treatment of the tissue with concentrations ranging from 30 to 100 μg/mL caused a rightward and downward shift in the concentration-response curves for CaCl2 and CCh. These results suggest that the spasmolytic effect of ALEO is mediated possibly through a non-competitive antagonist of calcium channel or muscarinic receptors. Our results are confirmed by the fact that perillaldehyde exhibited the highest docking scores on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M2 and M3) and voltage-gated calcium channels, with D-limonene showing lower binding energies in comparison. These remarks confirm that the activity of ALEO is attributed to the presence of perillaldehyde. In addition, perillaldehyde exhibits a low degree of in silico acute toxicity and high percent of intestinal absorption. CONCLUSION: In summary, ALEO exhibits myorelaxant and antispasmodic effects by inhibiting muscarinic receptors and calcium channels, which can be attributed to the presence of perillaldehyde. This provides a scientific foundation for the traditional use of A. leucotrichus in treating gastrointestinal disorders and opens up possibilities for developing a more effective and less toxic drug-utilizing perillaldehyde."

      "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a major cause of fatalities due to Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), can act as an opportunistic pathogen despite being part of the normal human flora. MRSA infections, such as skin infections, pneumonia, sepsis, and surgical site infections, have risen significantly, with bloodstream infection cases increasing from 21% in 2016 to 35% in 2020. This surge has prompted research into alternative treatments like nanomaterials, photodynamic therapy, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and essential oils (EOs). AMPs and EOs have shown higher success rates compared to other alternatives, gaining significant attention for their effectiveness against MRSA. In this perspective, we have created a database for peptides and EOs that have been discovered to treat MRSA. Manual data curation was done to get related information on each of the anti-MRSA EOs and AMPs from the PubMed articles. This led to the curation of 1789 peptides (1029 unique) and 863 EOs (671 unique) that have been reported against MRSA. This was followed by database creation and the development of tools for sequence analysis and determination of physiochemical properties. This resource has been named 'The Anti-MRSA Resource' or 'TAMRSAR' which we believe will aid in future drug development efforts to combat the diseases caused by MRSA.

In example, pigs may carry Salmonella strains, which can infect humans through contaminated food preparations. Due to their antibacterial properties and capacity to modulate bacterial drug resistance, essential oils (EOs) are attracting interest as prospective substitutes for synthetic antimicrobials which can help to reverse microbial resistance. Hence, the present study evaluates the antimicrobial effectiveness of the combination of tetracycline (Tc) compounds and Coridothymus capitatus (CC), Thymus capitatus L. (TC), and Thymus serpyllum (TS) EOs on 11 tetracycline-resistant Salmonella enterica strains isolated from the swine food chain. The kind of interaction between Tc and EOs was evaluated by Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI), while the composition of the EOs phytocomplex was linked to Tc antibacterial activity by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Interestingly, the EOs increased the strains susceptibility to Tc, inhibiting their growth despite the antimicrobial resistance. In most cases, synergistic and commutative effects were detected, as the combination of EOs and Tc compounds resulted in a noticeable decrease in the concentration (from 256 to 4 μg/mL) necessary to inhibit the strains. Thymol, carvacrol, linalool, sabinene, and other EO terpenoid components were revealed as the molecules working in concert with the Tc drug to increase the susceptibility of S. enterica strains to the treatment. Comprehending which molecules of the EOs phytocomplex, beside the main compounds, affect bacterial inhibition, might help to develop a tailor-made approach related to counteract the resistance of specific strains to different antibiotics."

      "abstract": "Candida albicans is a common opportunistic pathogen, causing infections ranging from superficial to bloodstream infections. The limited antifungal options and rising drug resistance challenge clinical treatment. We screened 98 essential oils and identified 48 with antifungal activity against Candida albicans at 1% concentration, determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Of these, 14 maintained fungicidal activity at lower concentrations (0.25% and 0.125%). 5 essential oils (Cinnamon, Satureja montana, Palmarosa, Lemon eucalyptus, and Honey myrtle) showed the highest inhibitory effects on stationary-phase Candida albicans and inhibited hyphae elongation. Synergistic effects were observed when combining Palmarosa with amphotericin B (AmB) against growing-phase Candida albicans, while Cinnamon and Satureja montana with AmB showed superior efficacy against stationary-phase infections. We identified the active components of 5 essential oils using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and found the following main constituents: Cinnamon primarily contains benzyl benzoate and eugenol, Satureja montana is dominated by carvacrol and cymene, Palmarosa features geraniol and geranyl acetate, Lemon eucalyptus includes dl-Isopulegol and citronellal, and Honey myrtle is characterized by citral and neral. Our results may aid in developing more effective antifungal treatments.",

      "abstract": "It is urgent to develop effective antibiotic alternatives for the control of subclinical necrotic enteritis (NE) in chickens after in-feed antibiotics have been banned. The current study investigated the efficacy of drinking water supplemented with essential oils and organic acids mixtures (EOA) on growth performance and intestinal health of broilers challenged with necrotic enteritis (NE). A total of 360 one-day-old Arbor Acres male broilers were randomly divided into 5 treatment groups, including non-challenged control group (T0), challenged NE group (T1), and challenged NE chickens treated with 0.2 % EOA1 (T2) or 0.2 % EOA2 (T3) in drinking water, along with NE-challenged chickens treated with 45 mg/kg bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD) in the diet (T4). Results showed that drinking water supplemented with either EOA1 or EOA2 significantly decreased Clostridium perfringens load in ileal content (P < 0.05). EOA2 markedly reduced jejunal crypt depth, serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content, ileal IL-1β mRNA level and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, significantly increased Mucin-2 mRNA abundance in ileum of NE infected broilers (P < 0.05) when compared with single NE-infected group. The 16S sequencing analysis revealed that, compared with single NE-challenge group and the antibiotic BMD group, the addition of EOA1 in drinking water significantly increased the Shannon index and Simpson index of ileal microbiota in NE-infected broilers (P < 0.05), while drinking water supplemented with either EOA1 or EOA2 significantly decreased Streptococcus relative abundance of NE-infected broilers (P < 0.05). In summary, drinking water with EOA2 might alleviate the intestinal injury induced by NE challenge, and the gut health-improving effects of EOA2 were better than that of EOA1.",

      "abstract": "The present investigation \"Effect of essential oils and chia seed (Salvia hispanica) in fortification of pineapple jam.\" was conducted during the year 2022-2023 at the Post harvest laboratory of Horticulture Department, Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, Dhaka. The study investigated the effects of essential oil and chia seeds on the quality of pineapple jam. In this research, pineapple jam samples were prepared with varying essential oil such as Cinnamon essential oil and Lemongrass essential oil at range of 1000 ppm. The addition of essential oil significantly impacted the flavour profile of the jam, enhancing the fruity notes and providing a pleasant aroma in sustainable and eco-friendly way. Moreover, it exhibited antimicrobial properties, extending the shelf life of the jam. Chia seeds were incorporated into the jam at different levels (6.25 %, 12.5 %, 25 % and 50 %) to assess their influence on texture and nutritional content. The results indicated that chia seeds contributed to a thicker consistency and increased protein content, making the jam a potential source of dietary protein. The maximum pH was found to be 4.90 from treatment (  C 4 E 0    = 50 % chia and no Essential oil). The lowest pH was recorded at 3.63 for  C o E 2    = No chia seed and 1000 ppm Lemongrass Essential oil). The investigation shows that lemongrass essential oil (E2) showed the best result in vitamin C retention. In case of chia seed 50 % (C4) treatment showed the best protein content. Additionally, the seeds added a subtle crunch and nutty undertone to the product. From the research it can be concluded that the treatment (  C 4 E 2    = 50 % chia seed and 1000 ppm Lemongrass Essential oil) showed the best result in case of vitamin C retention and protein incorporation. But considering spread ability and appearance (  C 3 E 2    = 25 % chia seed and 1000 ppm Lemongrass Essential oil) can be considered as best treatment for consumers. This research is motivated by the need to develop healthier, nutrient-dense pineapple jam using natural preservatives and fortifying agents. By exploring the combined effects of essential oils and chia seeds in preserving vitamin C and improving the jam's overall nutritional value, this study aims to meet the increasing demand for functional foods that prioritize both health and taste. The outcomes could offer valuable insights into natural preservation techniques and fortification strategies, potentially contributing to more sustainable and consumer-friendly food products in the market."

The effects of T. serpyllum EO on the activities of antioxidant detoxification enzymes were also measured. GC-MS analysis revealed that the main constituents of T. serpyllum EO were thymol (42.1%), p-cymene (22.4%), and γ-terpinene (18.6%). In the larvicidal toxicity experiment, the T. serpyllum EO demonstrated LC50 values of 0.606 and 0.664 mg/mL against the second- and third-instar larvae of S. litura, respectively, after 48 h exposure. Moreover, an EC50 value of 0.905 mg/mL was measured against S. litura eggs. In S. litura, T. serpyllum EO treatment reduced the enzymatic activity of ESTs and GST and, conversely, increased the enzymatic activity of AChE. Overall, this study demonstrated that T. serpyllum EO has the potential to be implemented as a novel eco-friendly insecticide against S. litura."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Despite being a commensal of human skin, Cutibacterium acnes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Acne vulgaris, with the loss of bacterial phylotype diversity being related to disease progression. This study evaluated differences in the virulence profile of C. acnes strains from different phylotypes and investigated the possible phylotype-selective efficacy of essential oils (EOs) from Thymus x citriodorus (TC), Thymus mastichina, and Cistus ladanifer compared to Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree), focusing on both planktonic and biofilm growth forms, the latter being related with pathogenesis and treatment resistance. METHODS: One collection strain and seven clinical isolates were classified into phylotypes using multiplex-touchdown PCR. Virulence trait differences across phylotypes were evaluated by studying antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, porphyrin production, and lipase activity. EOs were tested for minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBC) and effects on biofilm biomass and metabolic activity. RESULTS: Strains from phylotype IA1 were higher biofilm and lipase producers than phylotype II strains. Regarding EO's efficacy, TC EO presented lower planktonic MIC values for all strains compared to the other EOs, presenting a smaller difference in MIC values across phylotypes. TC EO was able to similarly reduce biofilm biomass and metabolic activity in phylotype IA1 clinical strains, being effective at lower concentrations compared with the remaining EOs. CONCLUSIONS: Not all virulence traits were phylotype-related, highlighting the multifactorial nature of the disease. TC EO showed a relevant anti-acne potential, outperforming tea tree EO (a species with a commercial claim for Acne vulgaris) against both planktonic and biofilm growth forms of C. acnes.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe cognitive impairment, affects millions of people worldwide. However, AD therapy remains limited and mainly symptomatic-focused, with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors being the major available drugs. Thus, AD is considered by the WHO as a disorder of public health priority. Among several strategies that have been identified to combat AD, the use of natural multi-target drug ligands (MTDLs) appears to be a promising approach. In this context, we previously found that the essential oils (EOs), obtained via hydrodistillation, from Azorean Cryptomeria japonica sawdust (CJS) and resin-rich bark (CJRRB) were able to exert antioxidant activity via different mechanisms of action. Therefore, in the present work, these EOs were screened for their (i) in vitro anti-AChE and anti-butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities, evaluated by a modified Ellman's assay; (ii) in vitro anti-inflammatory potential, using the albumin denaturation method; and (iii) toxicity against Artemia salina. The CJRRB-EO exhibited both anti-AChE and anti-BChE activities (IC50: 1935 and 600 µg/mL, respectively), whereas the CJS-EO only displayed anti-BChE activity, but it was 3.77-fold higher than that of the CJRRB-EO. Molecular docking suggested that α-pinene and ferruginol compounds contributed to the anti-AChE and anti-BChE activities, respectively. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity of the CJS-EO, the CJRRB-EO, and diclofenac was 51%, 70%, and 59% (at a concentration of only 2.21 μg/mL), respectively, with the latter two presenting comparable activity. Concerning the EOs' potential toxicity, the CJRRB-EO exhibited a lower effect than the CJS-EO (LC50: 313 and 73 µg/mL, respectively). Overall, the EOs from C. japonica biomass residues, chiefly the CJRRB-EO, displayed antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and anti-inflammatory activities in a concentration-dependent manner. These properties demonstrate that these residues may be suitable natural MTDLs for AD complementary therapy when administered through aromatherapy, or, alternatively, could serve as low-cost sources of valuable ingredients, such as α-pinene.",

Asarum sieboldii Miq. has a long history of traditional use for various medicinal purposes, attributed to its anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, and antioxidant properties. Despite research on Asarum sieboldii Miq. for allergic inflammation in respiratory diseases, detailed mechanistic studies are still lacking. AIM OF THE STUDY: We utilized bioinformatics and network pharmacology to identify the effectiveness of Asarum sieboldii Miq. in treating allergic rhinitis (AR). Our aim is to elucidate the potential therapeutic effects of essential oil derived from Asarum sieboldii Miq. (ASO), which is recognized for its diverse pharmacological properties, on AR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Common genes associated with the active compounds of ASO and AR were utilized to construct a related network and predict their mode of action. AR was induced in BALB/c mice by exposing them to ovalbumin (OVA) and particulate matter 10 (PM10; airborne particles <10 μm). With induction, aerosolized ASO (0.0002% and 0.02%) were administered via nebulizer for 5 min per day, three times a week for 7 weeks. Mice were examined for histopathological changes in the nasal tissue, nasal epithelial inflammation, the production of allergen-specific cytokine response in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The common genes of ASO and AR were predicted to include 'Tight junction', 'Apoptosis', and 'TGF-beta signaling', which are the main pathways of pathogenesis in AR. Consistent with network prediction, nebulized ASO treatment effectively improved the expression of tight junction-related factors, zonula occludens-1, claudin-1, occludin and junction adhesion molecule A, in OVA + PM10 induced mice. Additionally, it reduced hyperplasia of nasal epithelial thickness, goblet cell counts, and inflammatory cell infiltration (eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) in nasal lavage fluid, while also alleviating allergic symptoms such as sneezing, rubbing, and serum IgE level when compared to the AR-induced group. The levels of mRNA and protein expression related to tight junctions were restored to normal levels by ASO, as confirmed in immunofluorescence analysis in nasal epithelial cells RPMI2650. Furthermore, treatment of ASO on PM10-treated nasal epithelial cells significantly reduced ROS production, recovered mitochondria membrane potential, and inhibition of the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-13) and inflammatory mediators linked to the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Intranasal nebulization of ASO improves TJs and alleviates allergic nasal inflammation in AR. It supports the potential pharmaceutical application of ASO treatment for AR.",

      "abstract": "Despite progress in medical and surgical treatments of wounds, bioactive compounds still offer an effective and safe approach to accelerate wound healing (WH). In this review, recent results of studies on WH by essential oils (EOs) and their terpenoids are reported. Mechanisms of action of these substances and their possible use in drug delivery systems (DDSs) for WH are discussed. EOs of 38 species from 16 families have been evaluated for their potential to treat wounds. Lamiaceae was the most representative family with 10 species, followed by Myrtaceae and Asteraceae. EOs improve WH by acting as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial agents. Some other EOs were involved by increasing expression of transforming growth factor (TGF), inhibition of several factors, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), substitution of type III collagen by type I collagen, and up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These mechanisms improved repair of cells and increased proliferation. Alternatively, DDSs based on nanomaterials (NMs) used to carry EOs for WH are mainly based on nanoparticles (NPs), microparticles (MPs) and scaffolds. There is much evidence that EOs can promote WH. Advancement of nanotechnology in recent years has contributed to improving use of EO with DDSs in WH management. However, some limitations need to be addressed to achieve the translation of this technology into clinical applications for wound treatment.",

Naturally occurring essential oils (EOs) are considered an important component of traditional pharmacopeia because of their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. This has attracted researchers to identify novel therapeutic anti-pathogenic agents that could act as non-toxic quorum sensing inhibitors, thus controlling infections without encouraging the development of bacterial resistance. This prompted to undertake the current investigation to unravel the efficacy of EOs as QS modulators in reducing the virulence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study highlighted the anti-QS activity of fifteen EOs in modulating the QS-related traits by a reduction in capsular polysaccharide, exopolysaccharide and siderophore production in addition to inhibition of biofilm formation. The overall results suggest using EOs to develop alternate intervention strategies to mitigate infections caused by MDR strains of K. pneumoniae.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The phytopathogenic genus Fusarium can cause damage such as root and stem rot in economically important crops, with significant implications. To seek a sustainable method for controlling this phytopathogen in seeds, the antifungal activity of essential oils (EOs) from thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and oregano (Origanum vulgare) was evaluated against isolates of F. graminearum, F. equiseti, F. culmorum and F. oxysporum originating from quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) crops in the Boyacá (Colombia). RESULTS: Initially, the effectiveness of commercial fungicides against the mentioned phytopathogenic fungi was evaluated. Upon verifying that these isolates exhibited high resistance to these compounds, the EOs were assessed as a potential control alternative. A disk diffusion assay demonstrated complete in vitro inhibition of the growth of the evaluated phytopathogens when undiluted EOs were used. Subsequently, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these oils was determined using the agar well diffusion technique, revealing a MIC of 10 and 1 μL mL-1 for thyme and oregano oil, respectively. Following this, the antifungal activity of the EOs applied to quinoa seeds was evaluated, and germination indices were measured as an indirect indicator of their toxicity. CONCLUSION: Despite both EOs successfully inhibiting microbial growth in the seeds, it was also found that thyme EO at 100 μL mL-1 and oregano EO at 10 μL mL-1 inhibited seed emergence and germination. However, lower concentrations exhibited a reduction in fungal population without affecting these germination indices. Therefore, it is suggested that the use of these compounds has potential in the treatment and disinfection of quinoa seeds. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Onychomycosis is a common fungal infection that affects the nails and accounts for approximately 50% of all nail diseases. The main pathogens involved include dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton rubrum, members of the T. mentagrophytes complex, and emerging pathogens in this infection, T. schoenleinii and T. tonsurans. Tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia Cheel) essential oil (EO) has been proposed as a promising natural alternative to traditional treatments due to its antimicrobial properties. Among its more than 100 compounds, terpinen-4-ol is one of the main contributors to the antifungal action of this EO. To determine the antifungal activity of tea tree EO against dermatophytes, we designed an in vitro study using EUCAST-AFST protocols to obtain the values of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MFC (minimum fungicidal concentration) of several commercial M. alternifolia Cheel EOs against three species of dermatophytes isolated from clinical samples with suspected toenail onychomycosis. The results showed that the microorganism most sensitive to the action of the EO was T. rubrum, which had an MIC value more than 13 times lower than the value obtained for T. schoenleinii (0.4% v/v), the most resistant isolate. No differences in antifungal activity were observed by the analysed EOs or between the MIC and MFC values. These in vitro results suggest that tea tree EO is a viable option for the alternative treatment of onychomycosis, although clinical studies are needed to confirm the long-term antifungal activity, safety and efficacy of the oils studied in a clinical context."

The antifungal activity was determined by the contact method and the mycelial growth of the fungi was evaluated. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were obtained to suggest modes of action of the compounds analysed. The antimycotoxigenic activity was determined by high-performance liquid chromatograph. Aspergillus carbonarius was completely inhibited by cumin EO (500 µl l-1), by laurel EO and by cuminaldehyde (5000 µl l-1). The cumin EO (500 µl l-1) completely inhibited the growth of A. niger. All the samples inhibited the mycelial growth of A. ochraceus, especially cumin EO and cuminaldehyde (250 µl l-1). Aspergillus westerdijkiae was completely inhibited by cumin EO and cuminaldehyde (1000 µl l-1), by laurel EO and 1,8-cineole (10 000 µl l-1). A decrease in the production of ochratoxin A (OTA) was observed post-treatment, except in A. ochraceus, only inhibited by laurel EO.

The findings indicated that the methanol extract of E. chrysantha exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. Furthermore, both the methanol extract and volatile oil of the plant demonstrated potent inhibitory effects on tyrosinase and collagenase. A total of 84 volatile compounds were identified from the hydrodistilled oil obtained using a microwave oven, and 23 compounds were detected by the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method. The most frequently occurring volatile components were α-Phellandrene, o-Cymene, p-Cymene, E-β-Farnesene, Carotol, trans-Caryophyllene, and β-Phellandrene. The results of this study indicate that E. chrysantha has the potential to be developed for the treatment of hyperpigmentation issues and anti-aging applications.

This study reports the development of antifungal nail lacquers containing oregano essential oil (OEO), rosemary essential oil (REO), and biogenic silver nanoparticles (bioAgNPs). The formulations (F) were tested against dermatophytes using agar diffusion, ex vivo nail infection, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. They were evaluated for their pharmacotechnical characteristics and by FTIR-PAS to assess permeation across the nail. F-OEO and F-OEO/bioAgNPs were promising candidates for the final nail lacquer formulation, as they permeated through the nail and showed antifungal efficacy against dermatophytes-contaminated nails after 5 days of treatment. Treated nails exhibited decreased hyphae and spores compared to the untreated control; the hyphae were atypically flattened, indicating loss of cytoplasmic content due to damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. The formulations were stable after centrifugation and thermal stress, maintaining organoleptic and physicochemical characteristics. Both F-OEO and F-OEO/bioAgNPs had pH compatible with the nail and drying times (59-90 s) within the reference for nail lacquer. For the first time, OEO and bioAgNPs were incorporated into nail lacquer, resulting in a natural and nanotechnological product for onychomycosis that could combat microbial resistance."

      "abstract": "Malassezia (M.) pachydermatis, is often associated with secondary infection of the skin and external auditory canal in dogs and cats. The treatment of Malassezia infections is based on the local application of antifungals often combined with antiseptics. Due to increased resistance of yeast to commonly used antimycotics, especially in biofilm-forming cells, the use of natural substances, e.g. plant essential oils, appears as a new promised option. In this study, the efficacy of selected plant essential oils (EO) - oregano, rosemary, bergamot, clove, cinnamon, and thyme - in combination with chlorhexidine on both planktonic and biofilm-forming cells of M. pachydermatis, was investigated. The checkerboard test was used to determine the effect of chlorhexidine combined with individual EOs. According to the FICI (fractional inhibitory concentration index) in planktonic cells, most combinations showed additive effect, except for thyme and rosemary EO, where a synergistic effect was found (33.3 % and 16.7 % respectively). In the biofilm-forming cells, a synergistic effect was noted in chlorhexidine combined with bergamot EO, recorded in 6 isolates (33.3 %), and with thyme and oregano EO, detected in 3 isolates (16.7 %). A significant decrease (p ˂ 0.05) was found in FIC (fractional inhibitory concentration) compared to MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration), for both planktonic and biofilm-forming cells. Based on the obtained results, we can conclude that the combination of chlorhexidine with EOs achieved better efficiency than when using each agent alone and made it possible to reduce the concentration of both, and a sufficient antifungal and antibiofilm effect was achieved in M. pachydermatis strains."

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the essential oil was predominantly composed of monoterpene hydrocarbons (71.5 %) and oxygenated derivatives (20.2 %), with β-pinene (31.5 %), limonene (19.4 %), α-pinene (12.3 %), and α-terpineol (7.4 %) being the principal constituents. The n-hexane extract contained monoterpene hydrocarbons (42.2 %) and non-terpenic compounds (34.0 %), with β-pinene (32.8 %) and n-hexadecane (10.2 %) as the major components. Antimicrobial and mosquito larvicidal assays demonstrated that both samples exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 128 μg/mL for all tested organisms. Both samples also showed significant mosquito larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, with LC50 and LC90 values below 20 μg/mL at 24 and 48 hours post-treatment. Molecular docking studies suggested that limonene and α-terpineol could serve as potent inhibitors of mosquito odorant binding proteins. Additionally, an in silico analysis was performed to evaluate the physicochemical and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and toxicity) properties of the major constituents of the essential oil.",

Bacterial burden damages tissue and persists inflammation, failing to granulate, leading to morbidity and mortality. Various therapeutic strategies and approaches have been developed for chronic wound healing in clinical practice. As treating biofilm infection is crucial in chronic wounds, a potent antibiofilm agent, essential oils have been explored extensively for their therapeutic properties and as a replacement for antibiotic therapy. Currently, several studies on essential oils and their active compounds in therapeutics, such as adjunctive therapies, nanotechnology-based treatment and their drug delivery systems, help heal chronic wounds. The antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of essential oils make them distinct and are renowned as natural remedies to improve the healing of infected chronic wounds. Consequently, it accelerates wound closure by reducing inflammation, increasing angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. This review focuses on different essential oils and their active compounds that are exploited for the treatment of biofilm infection, chronic inflammation and wound healing. Thus, an effective novel treatment can be developed to improve the current treatment strategy to overcome multidrug resistance bacteria or antibiotic resistance in various chronic wound infections that support wound healing.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The goal of endodontic therapy is to completely eliminate the infection and stop microbes from infecting or reinfecting the root canal and the periradicular tissues. Amongst the primary microorganisms, Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), a Gram-positive anaerobe, is the main cause of pulpal and periapical inflammation causing root canal failure. Literature evidence shows that the gold-standard calcium hydroxide is ineffective against E. faecalis due to its resistance to the alkaline pH and proton pump mechanism. Herbal essential oils such as oregano, basil, and thyme are known to possess antimicrobial properties against E. faecalis. However, their combination with calcium hydroxide as an intracanal medicament and the depth of penetration is still unknown. Aim To evaluate the depth of penetration of calcium hydroxide mixed with three different herbal essential oils using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Material and methods Fifty single-rooted premolars were decoronated and randomly divided into five groups. Group 1 - Oregano oil with calcium hydroxide, Group 2 - Basil oil with Calcium hydroxide, Group 3 - Thyme oil with calcium hydroxide, Group 4 - Calcium hydroxide with saline, Group 5 - Negative control. The teeth were instrumented and inoculated with E. faecalis and incubated for 21 days. Calcium hydroxide mixed with respective oils or saline and 0.1% rhodamine B dye was placed in the canals and again incubated for 7 days. Two sections each of 1 mm were horizontally cut at 3 mm and 5 mm from the apex and later subjected to a confocal laser scanning microscope to evaluate the depth of penetration. One-way ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey test, and student t-test were performed. Results At the middle third, basil oil had the maximum depth of penetration (1377.47±14.1 µm) followed by oregano oil (1345.4±26.5 µm) and thyme oil (1160.4±24.6 µm). At apical third, basil oil (1152.4±31.6 µm) showed maximum depth of penetration, followed by thyme (988.3±26.2 µm) and oregano oils (419.5±19.8 µm). The depth of penetration of these oils was greater at the middle third than at the apical third. Conclusion Basil, oregano, and thyme oil have good penetration depth into the dentinal tubules and can be successfully used in root canal procedures as intracanal medicaments."

Seventy-two weaned piglets at 21 d old with body weight of 8.12 ± 0.168 kg were randomly divided into a control group (CON) and an experimental group, each consisting of six pens with six piglets per pen, and were fed either a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with 3 kg/t OA + 500 g/t EO (EO + OA). On the 14th day of the feeding trial, 12 weaned piglets were randomly selected from the CON group, and 6 piglets were selected from the experimental group. Based on diet composition and stress treatment, these 18 piglets were divided into the following three groups: 1) CON group. Piglets were fed a basal diet and received an intraperitoneal injection of saline as a control. 2) LPS group. Piglets were fed a basal diet and received an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (100 μg/kg body weight) to induce stress. 3) EO + OA + LPS group. Piglets were fed a basal diet supplemented with EO and OA and received an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (100 μg/kg body weight) to induce stress. The results showed that EO + OA significantly ameliorated the oxidative imbalance and inflammation disorder induced by LPS in piglets' serum and intestine by inhibiting the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Furthermore, compared to the LPS group, supplementation with EO + OA restored LPS-induced reductions in Bcl-2 protein expression in the piglets' intestines (P < 0.05) and mitigated morphological damage; it also enhanced both the protein expression and relative gene expression of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-1 (P < 0.05), and reduced the plasma diamine oxidase activity (DAO) and LPS content (P < 0.05). Compared to the CON group, supplementation with EO + OA altered the composition of the intestinal microbiota, increasing beneficial bacteria relative abundance (Faecalibacterium) (P < 0.05) and decreasing harmful bacteria relative abundance [Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group (P < 0.01), Negativibacillus (P < 0.05)]. Further analysis revealed that plasma LPS content in piglets was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium (r = -0.662, P = 0.021), Akkermansia (r = -0.492, P = 0.031), and average daily gain (ADG) (r = -0.912, P = 0.041). Plasma LPS content was also positively correlated with the plasma inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-1β (r = 0.591, P = 0.021), IL-6 (r = 0.623, P = 0.021), IL-12 (r = 561, P = 0.031) contents, and the relative abundance of Negativibacillus (r = 0.712, P = 0.041). In summary, the addition of EO + OA prevents the leakage of intestine derived LPS into the circulation by improving intestinal integrity and microbiota composition, thereby enhancing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory abilities and growth performance of weaned piglets."

      "abstract": "The study assessed the efficacy of parsley and dill essential oils (EOs) nanocapsules incorporated into fermented milk in hepato-renal protection against specific food additives. A molecular docking assay was conducted between parsley and dill EOs bioactive molecules and inflammatory cytokines. Freeze-dried parsley and dill EOs nanocapsules were developed, characterized for their morphological structure, particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index and encapsulation efficiency and assessed in fast green dye and sodium benzoate (SB) combination-treated rats. The docking results revealed that the primary constituents of parsley and dill EOs (apiol, myristicin, α-pinene, (-)-carvone, and d-limonene) interacted with the active sites of TNF-α, IL-1β and TGF-1β cytokines with hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions. D-limonene had the highest binding affinity (6.4 kcal/mol) for the TNF-α. Apiol and myristicin had the highest binding affinity (5.1, 5.0, 5.0 and 5.0 kcal/mol, respectively) for the IL-1β and TGF-β1 receptors. Biochemically and histopathologically, the excessive co-administration of fast green and SB revealed adverse effects on the liver and the kidney. Whereas the treatment with parsley and dill EOs nanocapsules afford hepato-renal protective effects as manifested by suppression the elevated liver and kidney functions. Parsley and dill EOs nanocapsules showed a significant reduction of the liver (64.08 and 80.5 pg/g, respectively) and kidney (59.3 and 83.6 pg/g, respectively) ROS. Moreover, parsley and dill EOs nanocapsules down-regulated the liver and the kidney inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and TGF-1β) and lipid peroxidation and up-regulated the antioxidant enzymes. In conclusion, the data suggest a potential hepato-renal protective effects of parsley and dill EOs nanocapsules."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (MDR-KP) poses a significant global health threat due to its involvement in severe infections and high mortality rates. The emergence of MDR strains necessitates the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. METHODS: K. pneumoniae isolates were obtained from human and animal sources. Antibacterial susceptibility testing was performed, followed by the evaluation of essential oil activity through inhibition zone, MIC, and MBC determinations. Checkerboard assays were conducted to assess synergistic effects with amikacin. Gene expression analysis and transmission electron microscopy were employed to elucidate the mechanisms of action. Molecular docking studies were performed to identify potential binding targets of bioactive compounds. RESULTS: Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from 25 of the100 samples examined, representing a prevalence rate of 25%. All isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant. Tea tree and thyme essential oils exhibited potent antibacterial activity and synergistic effects with amikacin. Notably, these combinations significantly downregulated the expression of key capsule virulence genes (wcaG, rmpA, magA, uge, and wabG), suggesting a novel mechanism for enhancing amikacin efficacy. Transmission electron microscopy revealed disrupted cell integrity in MDR-KP cells treated with the combinations. Molecular docking analysis identified Terpinen-4-ol, Farnesol, 1,4-Dihydroxy-p-menth-2-ene, and 7-Oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane as potential bioactive compounds responsible for the observed effects. CONCLUSION: By effectively combating MDR-KP, this research holds promise for reducing antibiotic resistance, improving treatment outcomes, and ultimately enhancing potential care."

Despite this, there are knowledge gaps regarding the toxicity mechanisms of plant EOs against non-target species. Here, the toxicology and enzymatic mechanism of Citrus reticulata and Citrus lemon EOs were evaluated against the vector pest, Haemaphysalis longicornis, and non-target ladybird beetle, Harmonia axyridis. Both EOs were mainly composed of d-Limonene, followed by β-Myrcene and γ-Terpinene in C. reticulata, and (-)-β-Pinene and γ-Terpinene in C. lemon. Citrus reticulata and C. lemon EOs were toxic to Hae. longicornis, with 50 % lethal concentration (LC50) values estimated at 0.43 and 0.98 μL/mL via nymphal immersion test, and 42.52 and 46.38 μL/mL via spray application, respectively. Among the constituents tested, β-Myrcene was the most effective, with LC50 values of 0.17 and 47.87 μL/mL via immersion and spray treatment, respectively. A significant mortality of non-target Har. axyridis was found when treated by the EOs at concentrations two times greater than LC50 estimated against H. longicornis. The biochemical assay revealed that the EOs induced changes in the antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutases, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in Hae. longicornis and Har. axyridis. The results demonstrated the acaricidal potential of citrus EOs and their major constituents for tick control, revealed the risk of the EOs to non-target species, and provided relevant insights into the mechanisms underlying their toxicity.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the variation in the chemical composition of Origanum compactum essential oils (EOs) from four geographically distinct locations. Additionally, we evaluated their antioxidant properties and potential inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), tyrosinase, and α-glucosidase enzymes and their insecticidal proprieties. Notably, this research also marks the first examination of the mineral composition of O. compactum. The chemical composition was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which identified thymol (28.72-80.39%), carvacrol (6.54-61.84%), p-cymene (0.27-8.64%), linalool (1.44-1.96%), and caryophyllene oxide (1.34-1.56%) as the major constituents. Concurrently, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) revealed significant levels of macro and microelements, including calcium (295.50-512.20 mg/kg), potassium (195.99-398.45 mg/kg), magnesium (59.70-98.45 mg/kg), and iron (43.55-112.60 mg/kg). The EOs demonstrated notable antiradical activities through DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power), and β-carotene bleaching assays. Regarding the insecticidal effect, all studied essential oils showed a significant toxicity against C. capitata adults, and the toxicity was dose and time dependent. The highest insecticidal effect was observed for O. compactum essential oils collected from Gouman (LC50 = 2.515 µL/mL, LC90 = 5.502 µL/mL) after 48 h of treatment. Furthermore, at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, the EOs exhibited strong inhibitory effects against AChE (84.75-94.01%), tyrosinase (84.75-94.01%), and α-glucosidase (79.90-87.80%), highlighting their potential as natural inhibitors of these enzymes. The essential oils of O. compactum contain components that could be used as a basis for synthetizing derivatives or analogs with potential medicinal applications and pest control properties."

      "abstract": "The widespread use of MLT may pose numerous hazards to animal breeding, health, and resilience due to the presence of MLT residues in animal feedstuffs, pastures, hay, and cereals. Many medicinal plants provide what is called a generalized anti-toxic remedy. The current study examined hazardous biochemical and histological reactions to MLT and the efficiency of ThEO and OEO essential oils as anti-toxic therapies to return to a natural state after MLT exposure. A total of 75 male albino rats were randomly assigned to two groups: (i) C - MLT, comprising 25 rats, served as the control group; and (ii) C + MLT, with 50 rats that were exposed to 5 mg/kg/BW. After exposure to MLT for 21 days, a return to normal status was determined by subdividing the C + MLT group into two equal groups: ThEO and OEO were used as treatments, with 100 mg/kg body weight of thyme and oregano essential oils, respectively, being administered for 21 days. The results showed a significant decrease in body weight gain (BWG) and final weight (FW) compared to C - MLT, while the therapeutic effects of ThEO and OEO enhanced FW and BWG. Our results indicated that MLT exposure resulted in deficient serum liver function, but that OEO and ThEO therapy brought about a significant improvement in liver enzyme function. Although there was no significant difference in serum aspartate transaminase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALK-Ph) and a significant drop in alanine transaminase (ALT) and acetyl choline-esterase (AChE) levels, the C + MLT group showed hepatic fibrosis in the third stage. Furthermore, histological sections of the OEO and ThEO groups showed reduced hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis. However, there was a significant increase in serum creatinine between the C + MLT and C - MLT groups following exposure to MLT. Histological sections of renal tissue from rats treated with OEO and ThEO showed reduced tubular damage, reduced interstitial inflammation, and preserved renal tissue architecture. In conclusion, OEO and ThEO are potential compounds for use as anti-toxic therapies to return to a natural state after MLT exposure. These compounds could serve as an experimental therapeutic approach against natural toxins, providing a solution to the problems of raising livestock that are exposed to nutritional toxicity."

      "abstract": "Chronic wounds represent a significant global health concern, statistically impacting 1-2% of the population in developed countries throughout their lifetimes. These wounds cause considerable discomfort for patients and necessitate substantial expenditures of time and resources for treatment. Among the emerging therapeutic approaches, medicated dressings incorporating bioactive molecules, including natural compounds, are particularly promising. Hence, the objective of this study was to develop novel antimicrobial dressings for wound treatment. Specifically, polycaprolactone membranes were manufactured using the electrospinning technique and subsequently coated with natural polyelectrolytes (chitosan as a polycation and a mixture of manuka honey with essential oils nanoemulsions as a polyanion) employing the Layer-by-Layer assembly technique. Physico-chemical and morphological characterization was conducted through QCM-D, FTIR-ATR, XPS, and SEM analyses. The results from SEM and QCM-D demonstrated successful layer deposition and coating formation. Furthermore, FTIR-ATR and XPS analyses distinguished among different coating compositions. The coated membranes were tested in the presence of fibroblast cells, demonstrating biocompatibility and expression of genes coding for VEGF, COL1, and TGF-β1, which are associated with the healing process (assessed through RT-qPCR analysis). Finally, the membranes exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with higher bacterial strain inhibition observed when cinnamon essential oil nanoemulsion was incorporated. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential application of nanocoated membranes for biomedical applications, such as wound healing.",

However, the comparison of the chemical composition, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory effects of the leaf essential oils of these species have not been investigated yet. A total of 38 compounds were identified via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, comprising 96.5-99.8 % of the total composition. Both A. pedunculata and E. lepta essential oils exhibited strong inhibitory effects against cancer cells (IC50: 59.04-97.52 μg/mL) while that of S. monophylla showed a lower anti-cancer effect (IC50>100 μg/mL). Among three essential oils, only the E. lepta leaf oil demonstrated a high anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-stimulated macrophages (IC50=6.47±0.65 μg/mL), while the others showed a moderate anti-inflammatory effect (IC50>50 μg/mL). Molecular docking studies also suggested the binding potential of the key compounds from three essential oils against inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, two proteins associated with inflammatory response, with the negative energies ranging from -41.0 to -71.9 kcal/mol. The present findings suggest the leaf essential oils from these species as potential medicines for treatment of cancer or inflammation associated diseases, especially the ones from A. pedunculata and E. lepta oils.",

      "abstract": "Bovine mastitis, an inflammation of the mammary glands, is mainly caused by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. While antibiotics are the primary treatment for this disease, their effectiveness is often diminished due to resistant strains and biofilm formation, creating the need for safer and more efficient therapies. Plant-based oil therapies, particularly those derived from the genus Eugenia, are gaining popularity due to their pharmacological potential and historical use. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and synergistic potential of essential oils (EOs) from four species of the genus Eugenia (E. brejoensis, E. gracillima, E. pohliana, and E. stictopetala) against S. aureus isolates from bovine mastitis. The EO of E. stictopetala was obtained by hydrodistillation, and its composition was analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The experiment employed seven clinical isolates from mastitis and two control strains: ATCC 33591 (methicillin-resistant S. aureus - MRSA) and ATCC 25923 (methicillin-susceptible and biofilm producer). A broth microdilution assay was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the EOs and oxacillin. The EO of E. stictopetala contained (E)-caryophyllene (18.01%), β-pinene (8.84%), (E)-nerolidol (8.24%), and α-humulene (6.14%) as major compounds. In the MIC assay, all essential oils showed bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects, especially the species E. brejoensis and E. pohliana, which had MICs ranging from 64 to 256 µg/mL. Regarding the antibiofilm effect, all essential oils were capable of interfering with biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations of ½ and ¼ of the MIC. However, they did not significantly affect pre-established biofilms. Additionally, a synergistic interaction was detected between the EOs and oxacillin, with a reduction of 75-93.75% in the antimicrobial MIC. Molecular docking studies indicated that the phytochemicals β-(E)-caryophyllene, (E)-nerolidol, Δ-elemene, and α-cadinol present in the EOs formed more stable complexes with penicillin-binding proteins, indicating a possible mechanism of antibacterial action. Therefore, these results show that the essential oils of Eugenia spp. are promising sources for the development of new therapeutic methods, opening new perspectives for a more effective treatment of bovine mastitis.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of yeast products (YP) and essential oils (EO) in total or partial replacement to in-feed antibiotic protocols (growth promoter and prophylactic), both in recommended doses and in overdose of prophylactic antibiotics (PA), on growth performance, and diarrhea incidence in the growing-finishing pigs; and fecal microbiota in market hogs. Four hundred pigs (20.36 ± 2.64 kg) were assigned to five treatments in a randomized block design: diets with prophylactic and growth promoter antibiotics (ANT); ANT with 30% more PA (ANT+30); diets with less PA and YP (ANT+Y); diets with less PA, YP and EO (ANT+Y+EO); and antibiotics-free diets with YP and EO (Y+EO). The content of the active components of the YP was 60% purified β-1,3/1,6-glucans extracted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast (Macrogard), 20% functional water-soluble MOS (HyperGen), and 18% MOS, extracted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast (ActiveMOS). From 0 to 14 d, pigs of the ANT+30, ANT+Y, and ANT+Y+EO treatments showed a greater body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) compared to pigs from the Y+EO group. From 14 to 35 d, pigs of ANT+30 and ANT+Y+EO treatments were heavier than Y+EO group. At 105 d, ANT pigs had a higher BW than the Y+EO group. For the entire period, ADG of ANT pigs was greater, and feed conversion ratio better than Y+EO pigs. From 0 to 35 d, pigs of the Y+EO treatment showed a higher diarrhea incidence compared to pigs of the other groups. From 49 to 70 d, ANT+Y and ANT+Y+EO treatments showed a lower diarrhea incidence than Y+EO group, which remained the case during the overall period. At 105 d, the alpha diversity of fecal microbiota by Shannon Entropy was lower in ANT, ANT+30, and Y+EO groups than observed for ANT+Y+EO group. The abundance of Firmicutes phylum and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was higher in ANT than in ANT+Y+EO pigs. Proteobacteria phylum abundance in ANT+Y+EO was higher than ANT, ANT+Y, and Y+EO. Peptostreptococcaceae family abundance was higher in ANT, ANT+30, and ANT+Y groups than in ANT+Y+EO and Y+EO groups. ANT+Y+EO and Y+EO groups show a lower abundance of SMB53 genus than ANT and ANT+30 groups. In conclusion, the use of YP and EO, in partial replacement to the in-feed antibiotic protocols, does not reduce the growth performance, can replace antibiotic growth promotors, and reduce the in-feed use of PA in growing-finishing pigs. The use of YP and EO, together with PA, increases the microbial diversity, despite having important genera for weight gain in less abundance. Overdose of PA does not improve growth performance and reduces microbial diversity, which does not characterize it as an efficient preventive protocol."

This is even more acute if gender is taken into account. To overcome this, the use of ethnobotany as a science of proximity is proposed. Specifically, an educational intervention is described that is based on a combination of active methodologies and the use of ethnobotany as a teaching tool for a subject with physics and chemistry contents. Ninety-two university-based primary education trainee teachers participated in the research. By means of questionnaires, information was collected regarding attitudes toward the subject and the use of ethnobotany as a teaching tool, evaluation of the proposal, sustainability awareness, and affective and emotional dimensions. The data indicated a great impact and acceptability. The results show a significant increase in motivation, an improvement in attitudes toward sustainable behavior and a favorable assessment of the proposed didactic tool. This hybrid methodology demonstrates, in the context used, effectiveness in improving the perception of science."

Accordingly, this study prepared zein nanoparticles loaded with eucalyptus essential oil (Z-EEO) and Litsea cubeba essential oil (Z-LEO), stable and with antifungal activity against Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, responsible for substantial damage to bean crops. The nanoparticles were prepared by nanoprecipitation with the aid of ultrasound treatment and characterized. The nanoparticles exhibited a hydrodynamic diameter close to 200 nm and PDI < 0.3 for 120 days, demonstrating the physical stability of the carrier system. Scanning electron microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the nanoparticles were smooth and uniformly distributed spheres. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed interaction between zein and EOs through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated the thermal stability of the nanoparticles compared to pure bioactive compounds. The nanoparticles exhibited a dose-dependent effect in inhibiting the fungus in in vitro testing, with Z-EEO standing out by inhibiting 70.0 % of the mycelial growth of C. lindemuthianum. Therefore, the results showed that zein has great potential to encapsulate hydrophobic compounds, improving the applicability of the bioactive compound as a biofungicide, providing protection for the EO.",

OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of our research was to investigate the antibacterial and antifungal activity of essential oils from fifteen plants harvested in the Taroudant region. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this work, the essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The method of disc diffusion in agar medium (aromatogram) is the one used to evaluate the activity of these essential oils against four pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp., and Enterococcus cloacae) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). RESULTS: Our findings, show that all of the plants' leaves yielded extremely aromatic essential oils that differed in look and color. Furthermore, the 93.33% of the fifteen essential oils that were evaluated proved to be effective against at least one kind of bacteria or fungus. This suggests that the proportion of essential oils with no antibacterial action was rather low, at around 7%. Our data also showed that the freshness or dryness of the plant at the time of harvest could affect the extraction rate of essential oils. This screening showed us that these essential oils present inhibitory activities towards the studied Gram+ bacteria, as well as a resistance against Gram-, in particular Enterococcus cloacae. CONCLUSION: These essential oils can therefore be used in the prevention and treatment of certain infectious diseases and to fight against bacteria that are multi-resistant to the usual antibiotics.",

Herbal essential oils (EOs) have been proposed as a suitable alternative to chemical drugs in intensive production management systems for better performance of broilers with slight side effects and admirable therapeutic properties. OBJECTIVES: This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of feeding cholecalciferol (VD) in combination of Satureja rechingeri EO (SREO) on growth performance, haematological indicators and immunological response of broilers. METHODS: A total of 540 1-day-old mixed-sex broiler chickens (Ross 308) were used in a completely randomized design with a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Experimental treatments included different concentrations of cholecalciferol (VD) (0, 2000 and 4000 IU/kg = 0, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and SREO (0, 200 and 400 mg/kg) on growth performance, haematological indicators and immunological responses of broiler chickens were investigated. RESULTS: The results showed that the chicken fed diet supplemented with 0.1 mg/kg VD (VD0.1) in combination of 200 mg/kg SREO (SREO200) increased the feed intake during the overall and first 14-day periods of the trial when compared with other dietary treatments. Interaction of VD0.1 × SREO200 led to more body weight gain (BWG) in the grower and finisher phases than all other feed treatment groups. The blood level of lymphocyte at day 42, heterophil at days 28 and 42 and heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio at 14 and 28 days of age were affected by VD0.1 + SREO200 in comparison with VD0 + SREO0 group. Feeding VD and/or SREO decreased triglyceride, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentrations at days 28 and 42 of the study, especially in VD0.1 + SREO200 treatment. Feeding VD0.1 + SREO200 also resulted in higher serum status of immunoglobulin M, lysozymes and phagocytic percentage among all treatments. CONCLUSION: Considering the outcomes, it is suggested that the combination of suitable concentration of VD and EO of the plant had favourable effects on the immune system and performance criteria of broiler chickens.",

      "abstract": "Pinus halepensis Mill. is a Mediterranean aromatic plant largely used, in addition to its nutritional value, in traditional medicine as antiseptic, antifungal, antituberculotic, and antirheumatic. Thus, the objective of this work was to appraise the antioxidant and cytotoxic activity of the essential oil (EO) of P. halepensis from Tunisia on cancer cell cultures, along with chemical composition evaluation by GC-MS. To attain the best yield and also highest quality in extraction of the EOs, conventional hydrodistillation (HD) and novel microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) methods have been performed and compared. The antioxidant activity was evaluated through the inhibition of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)• radicals. The cytotoxic activity in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and PC3) and cervical cancer cells (HeLa) of EO was evaluated by the MTT assay and effect on the cell cycle by flow cytometry analysis. A total of 38 and 37 components were identified from HD (HD-EO)- and MAE (MAE-EO)-extracted EOs, respectively, which were dominated by hydrocarbon compounds (HD-EO = 86.65%; MAE-EO = 77.36%), especially monoterpenes (HD-EO = 32.11%; MAE-EO = 21.55%) and sesquiterpenes (HD-EO = 44.29%; MAE-EO = 61.32%). Both extracted EOs showed significant antioxidant activity, as shown by the inhibition of DPPH• radicals [IC50 (HD-EO) = 4102.30 ± 159.73 μg mL-1 and IC50 (MAE-EO) = 3430.13 ± 78.46 μg mL-1]. Also, the EOs exhibited substantial (p < 0.001) antiproliferative activities with G0-G1 arrest on PC3, LNCaP, and HeLa cells by yielding very low IC50 values more conspicuous in MAE-EO with respective IC50 values of 25.70 ± 6.58, 14.97 ± 3.21, and 14.55 ± 2.30 μg mL-1. This finding points out for the first time that the EO of P. halepensis Mill. from Tunisia can be an effective natural antitumor agent with more pronounced activity when extracted with the MAE method that, after further in vivo studies, can be harnessed as a putative phytopharmaceutical for prostate and cervical cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a zooanthroponotic, nosocomial, and community-associated pathogen that threatens livestock management and even public health. The goal of this investigation was to clarify the role of S. aureus in zoonotic illnesses. Besides that, a novel trial was conducted in the current Egyptian study using oil extracts such as cactus oil, tea oil, geranium oil, and thyme oil to demonstrate the susceptibility of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates to these organic oils in response to the alarming global concern regarding the decreased susceptibility of S. aureus to known antibiotics, which exacerbates control and treatment protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 110 samples (45 raw cattle milk samples, 35 Karish cheese samples, and 30 human sputum samples) were collected. The bacterium was identified via traditional culturing methods, Gram staining, and the application of several biochemical tests. After that, various kinds of known commercial antibiotics were used to detect the antimicrobial susceptibility (AMS) of the obtained isolates. Furthermore, conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed to identify S. aureus (nuc gene) and MRSA (mecA gene), with further application of multiplex PCR for screening of all the obtained isolates for vancomycin resistance via targeting vanA, vanB, and vanC genes. Finally, the agar gel diffusion method was performed to assess the antibacterial activity of four plant extracts (cactus oil, tea oil, geranium oil, and thyme oil) against the obtained MRSA. RESULTS: The culturing method revealed S. aureus positivity in raw cattle milk (13.33%), in Karish cheese (28.57%), and in human samples (20%). The obtained isolates showed mainly resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic and ampicillin antibiotics, while the dairy samples showed further resistance against ceptaxime and an intermediate reaction against erythromycin. On the molecular side, PCR positivity was present in human samples (10%), raw cow milk (13.33%), and Karish cheese (14.29%). Nine of the fourteen PCR isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. Comparing the four oil extracts against the acquired MRSA isolates, cactus oil extract proved to be the most effective. CONCLUSION: The study's results are highly promising as they support the notion that certain essential oils possess strong antimicrobial properties against zoonotic S. aureus, thereby reducing the excessive use of antibiotics in veterinary and medical settings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of natural antioxidants and antimicrobials in dairy production can increase the variety of dairy-based products. In this study, the antioxidant and antimicrobial changes in lactic butter samples made from heat-treated creams and enriched with M. communis essential oils (EOs) were investigated. RESULTS: The best lactic butter properties were achieved by optimizing the process at 70 and 80 °C. M. communis EOs decreased lipid oxidation and spoilage microorganism growth in lactic butter during cold storage. M. communis EOs have antioxidant and antimicrobial activity in lactic butter equal to that of ascorbyl palmitate. α-Pinene, p-cymene, limonene, 3-carene, 1,8-cineol, β-linalool, α-terpineol and myretenol are the major contributors to the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of M. communis EOs. They exhibit antioxidant activity by neutralizing free radicals by donating hydrogen or acting as termination enhancers, and antimicrobial activity by disruption of cell membranes, which may result in the leakage of macromolecules or the loss of essential metabolites, ultimately leading to cell death during the storage of lactic butter samples. CONCLUSION: The addition of M. communis EOs improves lactic butter stability equal to that of ascorbyl palmitate, and may be applied as a natural and effective preservative to maintain butter from lipid oxidation and microbial spoilage and enhance its safety. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The growing recognition of the health benefits of natural antioxidants, as opposed to synthetic ones, has led to the development of new applications for natural antioxidants. In this regard, M. communis L. EOs can be used to enhance the shelf stability of cold-stored lactic butter. © 2024 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Recently, a large number of nosocomial infections have been caused by an emerging pathogen that is rising as a worldwide issue in human health: Candida auris. This yeast is considered resistant to antifungals of the first-line therapies, and consequently it is related to morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine the in vitro anti-C. auris activity against twenty-three resistant clinical strains of different essential oils (EOs), pure or in combination with traditional antifungal agents, mainly caspofungin, fluconazole, micafungin and 5-flucytosine. Broth dilution assay was performed to evaluate the fungistatic and fungicidal effectiveness of fifteen EOs towards all the C. auris isolates. The data demonstrated that EOs were able to prevent C. auris growth, with MIC values ranging from 0.03 to 1% for the efficacious EOs (thyme, cinnamon, geranium, clove bud, lemongrass and mentha of Pancalieri), whereas the MICs were >1% for the ineffective ones. Thereafter, the six most effective EOs were used to perform the checkerboard experiments by assaying simultaneously the activity of EOs and traditional antifungals towards two selected strains. The most promising synergic combinations towards C. auris, depending on the isolate, were those with micafungin and geranium, thyme, cinnamon, lemongrass or clove bud EOs, with fluconazole and mentha of Pancalieri EO, and with 5-flucytosine and mentha of Pancalieri EO. These EOs and their combinations with antifungal drugs may provide a useful therapeutic alternative that could reduce the dose of the individual components, limiting the overall side effects. These associations might be a prospective option for the future treatment of infections, thus helping to overcome the challenging issue of resistance in C. auris."

The study determined the activities of ATPases in the larvae after treatment with the LC20 and LC70 of each EO. α-esterase and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were also determined after treatment with LC10 and LC30 of each EO. Furthermore, molecular docking was employed to determine the binding affinity of terpinene-4-ol and α-pinene, the major constituents of O. majorana, and R. officinalis EOs, respectively, compared to the co-crystallized ligand of α-esterase, diethyl hydrogen phosphate (DPF). Toxicity assays revealed that O. majorana EO was more toxic than R. officinalis EO to the A. ipsilon larvae at 96 h post-treatment. However, the LC20 and LC70 of the latter significantly inhibited the activity of the Na+-K+ pump at almost all intervals. The same concentrations significantly inhibited the Mg2+/Ca2+-ATPase and Ca2+ pump at 96 h post-treatment. In contrast, O. majorana EO showed a variable effect on the Na+-K+ pump across different time intervals. On the other hand, LC10 and LC30 of both EOs showed varied effects on α-esterase and GST over time. Molecular docking revealed energy scores of -4.51 and -4.29 kcal/mol for terpinene-4-ol and α-pinene, respectively, compared to a score of -4.67 for PDF. Our study demonstrated the toxicity of the tested EOs to A. ipsilon, suggesting their potential efficacy as insecticides."

Materials and Methods: A total of 64 primary molars were used in this in vitro study. The teeth were randomly assigned to six groups (N=10). The root canals were prepared up to file #35, and all teeth were sterilized before contamination with Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis; ATCC 29212) suspension. After 48 hours of incubation, the root canals in each group were irrigated with the respective irrigants. Sterile paper points were then used to collect microbial samples from the root canals. A colony counter was used to count the number of colony-forming units (CFUs). Data were analyzed by SPSS version 20 (alpha=0.05). Results: The colony count was significantly different among the groups (P<0.001), and 2% M. piperita (P=0.009), 0.5% Z. multiflora (P=0.021), and 0.2% CHX (P=0.002) were significantly more effective than saline in elimination of E. faecalis. The ascending order of microbial count after irrigation was as follows: saline > 0.5% M. piperita > 0.2% CHX > 2% M. piperita > 0.5% Z. multiflora. Conclusion: The current study showed the optimal antibacterial activity of 0.5% Z. multiflora essential oil and 2% M. piperita essential oil against E. faecalis, and indicated their possible efficacy for use as an irrigant for root canal irrigation of primary molars."

Previous studies deduced the potent antioxidant and cytotoxic functions of the different extracts and isolated compounds from S. oleraceus. The current study represents the first instance of chemical profiling and bioactivities of the extracted essential oil (EO) of S. oleraceus. The present investigation set out to identify the chemical components of this EO by means of Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (G004-MS) techniques; assess the oil's antioxidant potencies through 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate (ABTS) assays; and evaluate the oil's cytotoxic impact against HepG2 cancer cell lines. The GC-MS chemical profiling revealed the identification of 23 components representing 97.43% of the total oil mass within abundant cyclic ketones (20.15%), nonterpenoidial hydrocarbons (28.77%), and sesquiterpenes (42.19%). The main components were n-nonadecane (28.77%), trans-caryophyllene (23.73%), trans-methyl dihydrojasmonate (19.55%), and cis-cadina-1,4-diene (9.44%). In a dose-dependent manner, this EO demonstrated antioxidant capacities on DPPH and ABTS, with IC50 values of 609.35 and 804.16 µg/mL, respectively, compared to ascorbic acid. Using doxorubicin as a reference therapy, the MTT assay findings revealed that this oil had remarkable inhibitory effects on the proliferation of HepG2 cancer cell lines, with an IC50 of 136.02 µg/mL. More studies were recommended for further investigation of new biological roles for this oil and its main components, along with the construction of action mechanisms based on chemical components."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori are the principal causative factor in the etiological factors of chronic, active, or type B gastritis; peptic and duodenal ulcers; stomach carcinoma; and epithelial tissue lymphoid malignancies. It infects more than half of the population worldwide. To reduce H. pylori production, pharmacological therapy of H. pylori diseases typically involves using threefold treatment methods. However, as a result of such therapy, antimicrobial resistance is commonly developed. Alternative therapeutics for H. pylori diseases are thus of particular interest. METHODS: Thyme essential oils (EOs) obtained from T. caramanicus Jalas plants in Iran were tested for antibacterial activity against H. pylori obtained from 320 poultry specimens in this investigation. Antibacterial activity was measured using inhibition zones, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). The impact of T. caramanicus Jalas essential oils on H. pylori isolate cagA, vacA, and babA2 gene expression was evaluated using a quantitative real-time PCR method (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The chemical content of these EOs varied significantly according to chromatographic examination. Thymol, carvacrol, and terpinene-4-ol are the most abundant components in these EOs. H. pylori was recognized as a Helicobacter species with a 175-bp PCR product of 16S rRNA in 20/20 (100%). According to PCR results, all 20 (100%) isolates belonged to H. pylori. The EOs inhibited H. pylori in a dose-dependent manner, with T. caramanicus Jalas being the most effective, followed by pterygium EOs in decreasing order. At 8 mg/mL of T. caramanicus Jalas EOs, IZs against H. pylori were 27.4 ± 0.42 mm, and at 8 mg/mL of pterygium, IZs against H. pylori were 1 ± 0.02. T. caramanicus Jalas essential oils were used to treat all bacteria, and the findings showed that T. caramanicus Jalas had a substantial inhibitory impact on the expression of cagA, vacA, and babA2 virulence-related genes (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In a dose-dependent manner, the EOs of T. caramanicus Jalas EO demonstrated a high degree of antimicrobial property against H. pylori bacteria. The most efficient EOs were those from T. caramanicus Jalas with relative concentrations of thymol and carvacrol, followed by the coumarin-dominated pterygium EO with reduced antibacterial activity."

      "abstract": "Nonylphenol (NP) is a ubiquitous endocrine disruptor that persists in the environment and can significantly contribute to serious health hazards, particularly intestinal barrier injury. Plant essential oils (EOs) have recently gained widespread interest due to their potential for improving intestinal health. However, the precise mechanism and protective effects of EOs ameliorating the intestinal damages induced by NP exposure remain unclear. To clarify the potential mechanism and protective impact of EOs against intestinal injury induced by NP, a total of 144 one-day-old male ducks were randomly allocated to four groups: CON (basal diet), EO (basal diet + 200 mg/kg EOs), NP (basal diet + 40 mg/kg NP), and NPEO (basal diet + 200 mg/kg EOs + 40 mg/kg NP). The data revealed that NP exposure significantly damaged intestinal barrier, as evidenced by a reduction in the levels of tight junction gene expression and an increase in intestinal permeability. Additionally, it disturbed gut microbiota, as well as interfered with tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. The NP-induced disorder of Trp metabolism restrained the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and resulted in decreased the expression levels of CYP1A1, IL-22, and STAT3 genes, which were alleviated after treatment with EOs. Taken together, NP exposure resulted in impairment of the intestinal barrier function, disruption of gut microbiota, and disturbances in Trp metabolism. Dietary EOs supplementation alleviated the intestinal barrier injury induced by NP through the Trp/AhR/IL-22 signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The chemical composition and biological activities of Eucalyptus essential oils (EOs) have been documented in numerous studies against multiple infectious diseases. The antibacterial activity of individual Eucalyptus EOs against strains that cause ear infections was investigated in our previous study. The study's antibacterial activity was promising, which prompted us to explore this activity further with EO blends. METHODS: We tested 15 combinations (9 binary combinations and 6 combinations of binary combinations) of Eucalyptus EOs extracted by hydrodistillation from eight Tunisian Eucalyptus species dried leaves against six bacterial strains responsible for ear infections: three bacterial isolates (Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three reference bacteria strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ATTC 9027; Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 6538; and Escherichia coli, ATCC 8739). The EOs were analyzed using GC/FID and GC/MS. The major compounds, as well as all values obtained from the bacterial growth inhibition assay, were utilized for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The antibacterial activity of the EO blends exhibited significant variation within Eucalyptus species, bacterial strains, and the applied methods. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), based on the diameters of the inhibition zone, facilitated the identification of two major groups and ten subgroups based on the level of antibacterial activity. The highest antibacterial activity was observed for the mixture of EOs extracted from E. panctata, E. accedens, and E. cladoclayx (paac) as well as E. panctata, E. wandoo, E. accedens, and E. cladoclayx (pwac) using the disc diffusion method. Additionally, significant activity was noted with EOs extracted from E. panctata, E. wandoo (pw) and E. panctata, E. accedens (pa) using the broth microdilution method. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that certain EO combinations (paac, pwac, pw, and pa) could be considered as potential alternative treatment for ear infections due to their demonstrated highly promising antibacterial activities.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic non-sp ecific inflammatory disease of the colorectal mucosa. Researchers have associated UC onset with familial genetics, lifestyle behavior, inflammatory immune factors, intestinal microbiota, and the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. The primary therapeutic interventions for UC consist of pharmacological management to control inflammation and promote mucosal healing and surgical interventions. The available drugs effectively control and decelerate the progression of UC in most patients; nonetheless, their long-term administration can exert adverse effects and influence the therapeutic effect. Plant essential oils (EOs) refer to a group of hydrophobic aromatic volatile substances. EOs have garnered considerable attention in both domestic and international research because of their anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties. They include peppermint, peppercorns, rosemary, and lavender, among others. Researchers have investigated the role of EOs in medicine and have elucidated their potential to mitigate the detrimental effects of UC through their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidepressant, and anti-insomnia properties as well as their ability to regulate the intestinal flora. Furthermore, EOs exert minimal toxic adverse effects, further enhancing their appeal for therapeutic applications. However, these speculations are based on theoretical experiments, thereby warranting more clinical studies to confirm their effectiveness and safety. In this article, we aim to provide an overview of the advancements in utilizing natural medicine EOs for UC prevention and treatment. We will explore the potential pathogenesis of UC and examine the role of EOs therapy in basic research, quality stability, and management specification of inadequate EOs for UC treatment. We intend to offer novel insights into the use of EOs in UC prevention and management."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although cancer therapy suppresses recurrence and prolongs life, it may be accompanied by strong side effects; thus, there is a strong demand for the development effective treatments with fewer side effects. Cancer therapy using plant-derived essential oils is attracting attention as one promising method. This study investigated the antitumor effects of essential oil volatiles on breast cancer cells and identifies four essential oils that display antitumor activity. METHODS: Breast cancer cells were cultured in a 96-well plate, then one of twenty essential oils was added dropwise to the central well. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h and the effect of the volatile components of each essential oil on the surrounding breast cancer cell growth ability was examined using an MTT assay. Gas chromatography was used to investigate the concentration of the transpiration components that may affect cancer cells. RESULTS: Of the 20 essential oils, Lemongrass, Lemon myrtle, Litsea, and Melissa displayed strong anti-tumor effects. These essential oils inhibited the growth of nearby breast cancer cells, even when diluted more than 500-fold. The transpiration component of lemon Myrtle showed the strongest antitumor effect, but was the least cytotoxic to mononuclear cells in normal peripheral blood (PBMC). Each of these essential oils contained a very large amount of citral. The IC50 against breast cancer cells when citral was volatilized from each essential oil was 1.67 µL/mL for geranial and 1.31 µL/mL for neral. Volatilized citral alone showed strong anti-proliferation and infiltration-inhibiting effects. CONCLUSION: The transpiration components of Lemongrass, Lemon myrtle, Litsea, and Melissa are thought to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation due to their high levels of citral.",

      "abstract": "Sugarcane-based fermentation is an essential process for different sectors of economic importance, such as the food industry with fermented and distilled beverages. However, this process can suffer from high contamination by wild yeasts and bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria (LAB). This makes it necessary to use decontamination strategies and search for new methods that have a low environmental impact and contribute to the production of organic products. Among the options, oregano and thyme essential oils stand out for their antibacterial compounds. The aim of this study was to use oregano and thyme essential oils as natural antimicrobials in the alcoholic fermentation of sugar cane juice. Initially, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the essential oils in the fermentation was assessed through turbidity in the sensitivity test, which allowed us to determine which concentrations of essential oils would inhibit the contaminants, 3 morphologically selected LAB strains, as well as assessing the viability of CA-11. For LAB, 3 concentrations of each essential oil were tested, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 μl/mL, while for CA-11 it was 0.06, to 0.1 μl/mL. The results indicated a maximum total value of essential oils per ml of 0.06 μl. Based on this result, a 24-1 fractional factorial was established, with 8 conditions +3 central points, with 4 variables, oregano essential oil (0, 0.03 and 0.06 μl/ml), thyme (0, 0.03 and 0.06 μl/ml), initial soluble solids (14, 16 and 18°Brix) and initial yeast concentration (2.5, 3 and 3.5 g/l), with the temperature set at 32 °C for a period of 12 h. The results showed that the center point condition with 0.03 μl/ml of oregano EO, 0.03 μl/ml of thyme controlled the proliferation of contaminating bacteria compared to the control condition. In the experimental validation, the treatment with essential oils had a lower final population of LAB (5.95 log) than the final population of the control treatment (6.53 log), and it was also observed that the treatment with EOs had an alcohol production around 3 % higher than the treatment without antimicrobials. The experimental validation phase confirmed the synergistic action of oregano and thyme essential oils in controlling the proliferation of contaminating bacteria. In conclusion, it was possible to determine the synergistic antimicrobial action of essential oils against LAB during alcoholic fermentation based on organic sugar cane.",

The optimal conditions for oregano/litsea cubeba (6:4, wt%/wt%) nano-emulsion were shown to be 80 s high pressure microjet pretreatment time, 9000 lb per square inch pretreatment pressure, 6 % oil phase, and 3:2 Km (mass ratio of surfactant to co-surfactant). The obtained nano-emulsion exhibited 100.42 ± 0.96 nm oil diameter at 4 °C after 15-day storage, coupled with high stability after centrifugation, freeze-thaw and heating treatment. Compared with untreated samples at day 6 storage, the nano-emulsion-treated grass carp fillets exhibited improved textural properties, higher water-holding capacity (74.23 % ± 0.80 %), lower total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N, 13.46 ± 0.30 mg/100g)/thiobaric acid (TBA,0.43 ± 0.02 mgMDA/100g), and lower total viable spoilage bacteria count (4.98 ± 0.21 lgCFU/g).

      "abstract": "Since prostate cancer (PCa) relies on limited therapies, more effective alternatives are required. Essential oils (EOs) and their bioactive compounds are natural products that have many properties including anticancer activity. This review covers studies published between 2000 and 2023 and discusses the anti-prostate cancer mechanisms of the EOs from several plant species and their main bioactive compounds. It also provides a critical perspective regarding the challenges to be overcome until they reach the market. EOs from chamomile, cinnamon, Citrus species, turmeric, Cymbopogon species, ginger, lavender, Mentha species, rosemary, Salvia species, thyme and other species have been tested in different PCa cell lines and have shown excellent results, including the inhibition of cell growth and migration, the induction of apoptosis, modulation in the expression of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes and the suppression of angiogenesis. The most challenging aspects of EOs, which limit their clinical uses, are their highly lipophilic nature, physicochemical instability, photosensitivity, high volatility and composition variability. The processing of EO-based products in the pharmaceutical field may be an interesting alternative to circumvent EOs' limitations, resulting in several benefits in their further clinical use. Identifying their bioactive compounds, therapeutic effects and chemical structures could open new perspectives for innovative developments in the field. Moreover, this could be helpful in obtaining versatile chemical synthesis routes and/or biotechnological drug production strategies, providing an accurate, safe and sustainable source of these bioactive compounds, while looking at their use as gold-standard therapy in the close future."

      "abstract": "Conventional therapy is commonly used for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions, but undesirable effects, such as erythema, dryness, skin thinning, and resistance to treatment, may cause poor patient compliance. Therefore, patients may seek complementary treatment with herbal plant products including essential oils (EOs). This scoping review aims to generate a broad overview of the EOs used to treat inflammatory skin conditions, namely, acne vulgaris, dermatitis and eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea, in a clinical setting. The quality, efficacy, and safety of various EOs, as well as the way in which they are prepared, are reviewed, and the potential, as well as the limitations, of EOs for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions are discussed. Twenty-nine eligible studies (case studies, uncontrolled clinical studies, and randomized clinical studies) on the applications of EOs for inflammatory skin conditions were retrieved from scientific electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library). As an initial result, tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) oil emerged as the most studied EO. The clinical studies with tea tree oil gel for acne treatment showed an efficacy with fewer adverse reactions compared to conventional treatments. The uncontrolled studies indicated the potential efficacy of ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi) oil, eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) oil, and cedarwood (Cedrus libani) oil in the treatment of acne, but further research is required to reach conclusive evidence. The placebo-controlled studies revealed the positive effects of kānuka (Kunzea ericoides) oil and frankincense (Boswellia spp.) oil in the treatment of psoriasis and eczema. The quality verification of the EO products was inconsistent, with some studies lacking analyses and transparency. The quality limitations of some studies included a small sample size, a short duration, and the absence of a control group. This present review underscores the need for extended, well-designed clinical studies to further assess the efficacy and safety of EOs for treating inflammatory skin conditions with products of assured quality and to further elucidate the mechanisms of action involved."

      "abstract": "Currently, researchers are looking for ways to replace synthetic pesticides with substances of natural origin. Essential oils are produced by plants, among other things, to protect against pathogens, which is why there is interest in their use as fungicides. This experiment assessed the composition of essential oils from a commercial source, their impact on the development of mycelium of pathogens of the Fusarium genus, and the possibility of using them as a pre-sowing treatment. Grains of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) were inoculated with a suspension of mycelium and spores of fungi of the Fusarium genus and then soaked in solutions containing oils of sage (Salvia officinalis L.), cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.), cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.), and thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.). The obtained results indicate that thyme essential oil had the strongest effect on limiting the development of Fusarium pathogens and seedling infection, but at the same time it had an adverse effect on the level of germination and seedling development of the tested plants. The remaining essential oils influenced the mentioned parameters to varying degrees. Selected essential oils can be an alternative to synthetic fungicides, but they must be selected appropriately.",
