      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The vascular and cardiometabolic effects of pecans are relatively understudied. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to examine how substitution of usual snack foods with 57 g/d of pecans affects vascular health, risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases, and diet quality, compared with continuing usual intake in individuals at risk of cardiometabolic diseases. METHODS: A 12-wk single-blinded, parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Adults with ≥1 criterion for metabolic syndrome who were free from cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes were included. Participants were provided with 57 g/d of pecans and instructed to replace the snacks usually consumed with the provided pecans. The control group was instructed to continue consuming their usual diet. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD),primary outcome, along with blood pressure, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), lipids/lipoproteins, and glycemic control were measured at baseline and following the intervention. Participants completed 3 24-h recalls at 3 time points (baseline, week 6, and week 12) during the study (9 recalls in total). The Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) was calculated to assess diet quality. RESULTS: In total, 138 participants (mean ± SD; 46 ± 13 y, 29.8 ± 3.7 kg/m2) were randomly assigned (69 per group). No between-group differences in FMD, cf-PWV, or blood pressure were observed. Compared with the usual diet group, pecan intake reduced total cholesterol (-8.1 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -14.5, -1.7), LDL cholesterol (-7.2 mg/dL; 95% CI -12.3, -2.1), non-HDL-cholesterol (-9.5 mg/dL; 95% CI -15.3, -3.7), and triglycerides concentrations (-16.4 mg/dL; 95% CI -30.0, -2.9). Weight tended to increase in the pecan group compared with the usual diet group (0.7 kg; 95% CI -0.1, 1.4). The HEI-2020 increased by 9.4 points (95% CI 5.0, 13.7) in the pecan group compared with the usual diet group. CONCLUSIONS: Replacing usual snacks with 57 g/d of pecans for 12-wk improves lipids/lipoproteins and diet quality but does not affect vascular health in adults at risk of cardiometabolic disease. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05071807.",

      "abstract": "In-shell pecans are typically harvested after falling from trees to the ground, presenting a potential route of contamination of foodborne pathogens from soil contact. In-shell pecans are often subjected to various processing or washing steps prior to being shelled. This study determined Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) reductions after treatment with antimicrobial washes on direct and soil-inoculated in-shell pecans and evaluated the cross-contamination potential of the spent pecan washes after treatment. Pecans were directly and soil-inoculated with an STEC cocktail (O157:H7, O157:NM, O121, O26). Direct inoculation was achieved by spraying the STEC cocktail on the pecans. For soil-inoculation pecans, autoclaved soil was sprayed with the STEC cocktail, homogenized for 2 min, and used to coat in-shell pecans. Inoculated pecans were washed in treatments of 2% lactic acid (LA), 1,000 ppm free chlorine (sodium hypochlorite; NaClO), hot water (HW; 85 ± 2 °C), or ambient water (C [control]; 18 ± 2 °C) for 2, 5, and 10 min and diluted to enumerate STEC populations. After treatments, 100 mL of the spent wash was vacuum filtered through a 0.45-µm membrane and plated on selective agar. HW significantly reduced STEC populations from pecans with and without soil regardless of treatment time (p < 0.05), NaClO reduced STEC populations more than the ambient control wash on directly inoculated pecans, but there were no significant differences between STEC reductions from ambient water (C), LA, and NaClO treatments on soil-inoculated pecans (p > 0.05). Larger STEC populations were enumerated from ambient water wash compared to the antimicrobial washes (p < 0.05). The HW, LA, and NaClO treatments were effective at maintaining the quality of the wash water, with STEC levels being generally at or below the detection limit (<1 CFU/100 mL), while HW was the most effective at reducing STEC from in-shell pecans with and without a soil coating (>5-log CFU/mL reductions).",

      "abstract": "During harvest pecan nuts are at risk of contamination with foodborne pathogens from extended contact with the ground. The objective of this study was to determine the potential transfer of Escherichia coli and Salmonella from the ground to in-shell pecans during the harvesting process. Plots (2 m2) were sprayed with 1 L of a rifampicin (rif) resistant strain of either E. coli TVS 353 or an attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium inoculum at a low (∼4 log CFU/ml), mid (∼6 log CFU/ml) or high (∼8 log CFU/ml) concentrations. The following day, nuts were mechanically harvested and samples from each plot were collected at 1 min, 4 h, and 24 h. Samples were enumerated for Salmonella and E. coli on tryptic soy agar supplemented with rif. The Salmonella levels in the soil from the inoculated plots were 2.0 ± 0.3, 4.1 ± 0.1, and 6.4 ± 0.2 log CFU/g for the low, mid, and high inocula, respectively. The E. coli levels in the soil from the inoculated plots were 1.5 ± 0.4, 3.7 ± 0.3, and 5.8 ± 0.1 log CFU/g for the low, mid, and high inocula, respectively. There was a significant difference in the average daily rainfall among the three trials. Trial 3 received 23.8 ± 9.2 cm, while trials 1 and 2 received much less (0.1 ± 0.1 0.0 ± 0.0 cm, respectively). Inoculation concentration and trial were significant (P<0.05) factors that influenced the transfer of E. coli and Salmonella to pecans. For the high inoculum treatment, bacterial transfer to pecans ranged from 0.7 ± 0.3 to 4.1 ± 0.2 for E. coli and 1.3 ± 0.7 to 4.3 ± 0.4 log CFU/g for Salmonella. For the medium inoculum treatment, transfer ranged from <0.3 to 1.5 ± 0.1 for E. coli and <0.3 to 1.9 ± 0.2 log CFU/g for Salmonella. For the low treatment, transfer ranged from <0.3 to 0.4 ± 0.2 and <0.3 to 0.5 ± 0.1 log CFU/g for E. coli and Salmonella, respectively. These results show the need for implementing agricultural practices that prevent potential transfer of foodborne pathogens onto the surface of in-shell pecans during harvest."

      "abstract": "Pecans (Carya illinoinensis) are considered a functional food due to the high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber and polyphenols. To determine the effect of whole pecans (WP) or a pecan polyphenol (PP) extract on the development of metabolic abnormalities in mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet, we fed C57BL/6 mice with a Control diet (7% fat), HF diet (23% fat), HF containing 30% WP or an HF diet supplemented with 3.6 or 6 mg/g of PP for 18 weeks. Supplementation of an HF diet with WP or PP reduced fat mass, serum cholesterol, insulin and HOMA-IR by 44, 40, 74 and 91%, respectively, compared to the HF diet. They also enhanced glucose tolerance by 37%, prevented pancreatic islet hypertrophy, and increased oxygen consumption by 27% compared to the HF diet. These beneficial effects were associated with increased thermogenic activity in brown adipose tissue, mitochondrial activity and AMPK activation in skeletal muscle, reduced hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration of subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes, reduced hepatic lipid content and enhanced metabolic signaling. Moreover, the microbial diversity of mice fed WP or PP was higher than those fed HF, and associated with lower circulating lipopolysaccharides (~83-95%). Additionally, a 4-week intervention study with the HF 6PP diet reduced the metabolic abnormalities of obese mice. The present study demonstrates that WP or a PP extract prevented obesity, liver steatosis and diabetes by reducing dysbiosis, inflammation, and increasing mitochondrial content and energy expenditure. Pecan polyphenols were mainly condensed tannin and ellagic acid derivatives including ellagitannins as determined by LC-MS. Herein we also propose a model for the progression of the HF diet-mediated metabolic disorder based on early and late events, and the possible molecular targets of WP and PP extract in preventive and intervention strategies. The body surface area normalization equation gave a conversion equivalent to a daily human intake dose of 2101-3502 mg phenolics that can be obtained from 110-183 g pecan kernels/day (22-38 whole pecans) or 21.6-36 g defatted pecan flour/day for an average person of 60 kg. This work lays the groundwork for future clinical studies.",

      "abstract": "Pecan nuts, a healthy food, have shown an increased demand for consumption. Therefore, there must be a certain level of care to avoid quality losses, which are primarily influenced by storage conditions and time. This study evaluates the effects of long-term controlled atmosphere (CA) storage with low O2 partial pressure (pO2 - 2 kPa), combined or not with high CO2 (pCO2 - 40 or 80 kPa), carnauba wax coating (CW), and ambient atmosphere (AMB; control) at 10 and 20 °C, on unshelled 'Barton' pecan nut quality. Color, water activity (Aw), moisture content (MC), and oxidation markers, such as peroxide value (PV), acidity value (AV), TBARS, and volatile compounds (VC) were evaluated. Storage up to twelve months at 10 °C and with CA (regardless of the temperature) ensured higher luminosity and color parameter b* (\"golden\") and a lower a* parameter (\"reddish\"). The MC ranged from 2.8 to 3.6%, irrespective of storage conditions, for up to twelve months, which is suitable. The AMB at 10 °C ensured lower AV, TBARS, and PV compared to the CW treatment. Furthermore, CA with low pO2 and high pCO2, even at 20 °C, guaranteed lower AV, TBARS, and PV. Storage at 20 °C increased characteristic VCs of lipid oxidation (aldehydes, acids, alcohols, ketones, lactones, and esters, especially with CW coating). However, all conditions at 10 °C and with pCO2 (even associated at 20 °C) reduced the presence of these VCs. The CW used as a coating on the pecans did not show satisfactory results and should not be recommended for pecan storage at these applied conditions. Our findings showed that low pO2 and high pCO2 maintain better pecan quality than O2 ambient (20 kPa), even at temperatures above refrigeration (20 °C). Nevertheless, there were no significant differences between 40 and 80 kPa CO2.",

      "abstract": "This project was undertaken to determine the kinetic parameters of thermal inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes on pecans, macadamia nuts, and sunflower seeds subjected to heat treatments simulating industry processes. Five strains were grown in nonselective medium, mixed, and resuspended before inoculating macadamia nuts, pecans, and sunflower seeds (6 to 9 Log CFU/g). Redried inoculated pecans and macadamia nuts were heated in an oven at a temperature range of 90 to 140°C. Unshelled sunflower seeds were heated in sunflower seed oil. The thermal inactivation was determined by measuring viable cell counts using standard microbiological methods. Average count data were fit to the log-linear model, and thermal-death kinetics were calculated. On pecans, the viable Listeria counts were reduced by 3 and 3.5 Log CFU/g after 40 min at 110°C and 8 min at 140°C, respectively. On macadamia nuts, the L. monocytogenes population was reduced by 5 Log CFU/g after 20 min at 120°C. Unshelled sunflower seeds were subjected to heat treatment via a hot-oil bath. On sunflower seeds, >7 Log CFU/g reductions were observed after 15 min at 120°C. The thermal resistance (D value) for inactivation on pecans at 140°C was 3.1 min and on macadamia nuts at 120°C was 4.4 min. The inactivation of L. monocytogenes was influenced by the kind of nut or seed. These results suggest that L. monocytogenes has a relatively high thermal tolerance. The findings from this study will contribute to the assessment of the effectiveness of heat treatment for control of this pathogen on nuts and seeds. IMPORTANCE Listeria monocytogenes is a major concern for the food industry in ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. In recent years, large-scale recalls have occurred with contaminated sunflower seeds and macadamia nuts that triggered product withdrawals. These events stress the importance of understanding Listeria's ability to survive heat treatments in these low-water activity foods. Nuts and seeds are subjected to a variety of thermal treatments typically referred as roasting. To date, no listeriosis outbreak has been linked to nuts and seeds, but the recent recognition that this pathogen can be detected in commercial products stresses the need for research on thermal treatments. The characterization of heat inactivation kinetics at temperatures typically used during roasting processes will be very beneficial for validation studies. This manuscript reports inactivation rates of L. monocytogenes strains inoculated onto macadamia nuts, sunflower seeds, and pecan halves subjected to temperatures between 90 and 140°C.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of sulfuryl fluoride was evaluated for control of fourth-instar pecan weevil, Curculio caryae (Horn), at 25°C for a 24-h exposure. Larvae, collected as they naturally emerged from pecans, were used to artificially infest pecan nuts. Infested nuts were fumigated with six concentration by time (CT) treatment dosages of sulfuryl fluoride (0-750 g-h/m3) within air-tight, glass containers. The sulfuryl fluoride concentration in each fumigation container was analyzed 30 min after sulfuryl fluoride introduction and just prior to termination of the experiment. Mean sulfuryl fluoride CT dosages were calculated from sulfuryl fluoride measurements and were used for probit analysis. The lethal accumulated dosage (LAD99) of sulfuryl fluoride for pecan weevil was 1052.0 g-h/m3 with a 95% C.I. of 683.21-2,573.0 g-h/m3. For the confirmatory trial, we used two sulfuryl fluoride CT dosage treatments, 1,100 and 1,300 g-h/m3, and a nonfumigated control. All larvae were dead in both fumigation treatments by 14-d postfumigation. Due to higher mortality in the nonfumigated control in the confirmatory trial compared to that of the dose-response trial, 1300 g-h/m3 was selected as the sulfuryl fluoride CT dosage for a proposed quarantine treatment schedule. Fumigating pecans with sulfuryl fluoride can control larval pecan weevil infestations in commercially traded nuts and maintain compliance with quarantine regulations both within and outside the United States.",

Due to the complex nature of nut and nut products, processes and equipment, it is difficult to use one validation study for all and may requires individual equipment be validated at the plant level. In plant validation studies, pathogens such as Salmonella cannot be used due to the risk of contamination, thus the suitability of a non-pathogenic organism, Enterococcus faecium as a surrogate for Salmonella was evaluated for peanut and pecan thermal processing. Stagnant and forced dry air heating conditions, (120 °C (20, 30, 40 min), 130 °C (10, 20, 30 min), 140 °C (10, 20, 30 min)) were evaluated for unblanched peanut kernels.

      "abstract": "A quantitative risk assessment was conducted to assess the risk of human salmonellosis acquired from consumption of pecans in the United States. The model considered the potential for Salmonella survival, growth, and recontamination of pecans from the sheller to the consumer, including steps such as immersion in water, drying, conditioning, cracking, partitioning, and storage. Five theoretical microbial reduction treatment levels (1 to 5 log CFU) were modeled. Data from the 2010 to 2013 surveys by the National Pecan Shellers Association were used for initial prevalence and contamination levels. The impacts of atypical situations in the pecan production system were also evaluated. Higher initial contamination levels, recontamination during processing, and a delay in drying postconditioning were the modeled atypical situations. The baseline model predicted a mean risk of salmonellosis in the United States from consumption of in-shell and shelled pecans processed by cold conditioning with no microbial reduction treatment and no further home cooking as 1 case per 775,193 servings (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1 case per 1,915,709 to 178,253 servings). This predicted risk per serving was estimated as a mean of 529 cases of salmonellosis per year (95% CI: 213 to 2,295 cases). Hot conditioning for shelled pecans and microbial reduction treatment of both shelled and in-shell pecans had a significant impact on the predicted mean risk of illness. Assuming 77% of the shelled pecans sold at retail (i.e., 80% of the retail supply) received hot conditioning, the mean estimated salmonellosis cases per year from consumption of in-shell and shelled pecans uncooked at home was 203 (95% CI: 81 to 882 cases) if no additional microbial reduction treatment were applied. The predicted risk of illness per serving was higher for all atypical situations modeled compared with the baseline model, and delay in drying had the greatest impact on risk.",

      "abstract": "Chlorine, organic acids, and water extracts of inedible pecan components were tested for effectiveness in killing Salmonella on pecans. In-shell pecans and nutmeats (U.S. Department of Agriculture medium pieces) were immersion inoculated with a mixture of five Salmonella serotypes, dried to 3.7% moisture, and stored at 4°C for 3 to 6 weeks. In-shell nuts were immersed in chlorinated water (200, 400, and 1,000 μg/ml), lactic acid (0.5, 1, and 2%), and levulinic acid (0.5, 1, and 2%) with and without 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and a mixed peroxyacid sanitizer (Tsunami 200, 40 μg/ml) for up to 20 min at 21°C. The rate of reduction of free chlorine in conditioning water decreased as the ratio of in-shell nuts/water was increased. The rate of reduction was more rapid when nuts were not precleaned before treatment. The initial population of Salmonella on in-shell nuts (5.9 to 6.3 log CFU/g) was reduced by 2.8 log CFU/g after treating with chlorinated water (1,000 μg/ml). Treatment with 2% lactic acid plus SDS or 2% levulinic acid plus SDS reduced the pathogen by 3.7 and 3.4 log CFU/g, respectively. Lactic and levulinic acids (2%) without SDS were less effective (3.3- and 2.1-log CFU/g reductions, respectively) than acids with SDS. Treatment with Tsunami 200 resulted in a 2.4-log CFU/g reduction. In-shell nuts and nutmeats were immersed in water extracts of ground pecan shucks (hulls), shells, a mixture of shells and pith, and pith. The general order of lethality of extracts to Salmonella was shuck < shell-pith ≤ shell ≤ pith < chlorine (400 μg/ml) and shuck < shell ≤ pith = shell-pith < chlorine (400 μg/ml). Results emphasize the importance of removing soil and dust on in-shell pecans before conditioning in chlorinated water and the need for sanitizers with increased effectiveness in killing Salmonella on pecans.",

      "abstract": "Tree nuts contain an array of phytochemicals including carotenoids, phenolic acids, phytosterols and polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids, proanthocyanidins (PAC) and stilbenes, all of which are included in nutrient databases, as well as phytates, sphingolipids, alkylphenols and lignans, which are not. The phytochemical content of tree nuts can vary considerably by nut type, genotype, pre- and post-harvest conditions, as well as storage conditions. Genotype affects phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes and phytosterols, but data are lacking for many other phytochemical classes. During the roasting process, tree nut isoflavones, flavanols and flavonols were found to be more resistant to heat than the anthocyanins, PAC and trans-resveratrol. The choice of solvents used for extracting polyphenols and phytosterols significantly affects their quantification, and studies validating these methods for tree nut phytochemicals are lacking. The phytochemicals found in tree nuts have been associated with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, antiviral, chemopreventive and hypocholesterolaemic actions, all of which are known to affect the initiation and progression of several pathogenic processes. While tree nut phytochemicals are bioaccessible and bioavailable in humans, the number of intervention trials conducted to date is limited. The objectives of the present review are to summarise tree nut: (1) phytochemicals; (2) phytochemical content included in nutrient databases and current publications; (3) phytochemicals affected by pre- and post-harvest conditions and analytical methodology; and (4) bioactivity and health benefits in humans.",

Treatment of immersion-inoculated, dried, stored pecans in chlorinated water (400 μg/ml) reduced Salmonella by not more than 1.6 log CFU/g. Treatment of immersion-inoculated, dried, stored pecans in chlorinated water (200 μg/ml, 1 min) followed by soaking in water for 2 h at 21°C and treating for 10 min in water at 85 to 95°C reduced Salmonella by >5.12 log CFU/g; treatment of nuts containing a low population of Salmonella (<0.60 log CFU/g) for 15 min at 90°C failed to eliminate the pathogen. Reductions of ≥6.42 log CFU/g were achieved by treating surface-inoculated nuts in water at 90 or 95°C for 80 s; treatment of nuts containing 1.78 log CFU/g at 95°C for 10 min did not eliminate the pathogen. Salmonella on surface-inoculated in-shell pecans (kernel moisture, 4.75%; water activity, 0.62) that had been dried and stored at 4°C for 3 to 5 weeks was more resistant to conditioning treatments than was Salmonella on surface-inoculated pecans (kernel moisture, 5.60%; water activity, 0.73) that were not thoroughly dried. Conditioning treatments were less effective for killing Salmonella on immersion-inoculated pecans than on surface-inoculated pecans. Response of Salmonella to conditioning treatments varied, depending on the method of inoculation and whether nuts were dried and stored between the time of inoculation and treatment, which emphasizes the importance of following practices commonly used by commercial pecan shellers when validating the lethality of conditioning treatments.",

After an average of three years, the tree trunks with biosolid treatment grew 9.5% more than with CF; the length of the bearing shoots was 18.1 and 18.3cm and the production of nuts/tree was 9.26 and 8.75kg for pecans with CF and with biosolids, respectively. Western foliar nutrient concentration and nut quality were statistically equal in trees with CF and with biosolids. Soil inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi improved shoot growth by 19.4% when CF was applied, but did not when biosolids were used. Nutrient status and yield did not increase with mycorrhizal fungi. The addition of Trichoderma sp. did not favor any of the variables evaluated with both nutrient sources.

DESIGN: Eight-week, randomized, controlled study of pecan treatment group vs control group. SUBJECT: Nineteen people with normal lipid levels completed the study; 10 had been randomly assigned to the pecan treatment group (7 women, 3 men, mean age = 45 +/- 10 years) and 9 to the control group (8 women, 1 man, mean age = 37 +/- 12 years). INTERVENTION: The pecan treatment group consumed 68 g pecans per day for 8 weeks plus self-selected diets. The pecans contributed 459 kcal and 44 g fat daily. The control group avoided nuts and consumed self-selected diets. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and total triglyceride levels were measured at the time of entrance to the study (baseline), week 4, and week 8. Computer analyses were done on five 3-day food records. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Comparisons were made using analysis of variance or paired t test. RESULTS: LDL-C was lowered in the pecan treatment group from 2.61 +/- 0.49 mmol/L at baseline to 2.35 +/- 0.49 at week 4 (P < .05) and to 2.46 +/- 0.59 at week 8 (P < .05). At week 8, total cholesterol and HDL-C in the pecan treatment group were significantly lower (P < .05) than in the control group (total cholesterol: 4.22 +/- 0.83 vs 5.02 +/- 0.54 mmol/L; HDL-C: 1.37 +/- 0.23 vs 1.47 +/- 0.34 mmol/L). Dietary fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, insoluble fiber, magnesium, and energy were significantly higher in the pecan treatment group than in the control group. Body mass indexes and body weights were unchanged in both groups. APPLICATIONS: Pecans can be included in a healthful diet when energy intake and potential weight gain are addressed.",

Thermal treatments normally carried out during the processing of pecans are inadequate to consistently destroy salmonellae in highly contaminated inshell nuts. Pecan nut packing tissue was toxic to salmonellae, thus affording some protection against high initial contamination and subsequent survival of the organisms. Examinations of inoculated inshell pecans stored at -18, -7, 5, and 21 C for up to 32 weeks revealed that the extent of survival was inversely correlated to the storage temperature. S. senftenberg 775W and S. anatum were not detectable on inshell nuts after 16 weeks of storage at 21 C. Little decrease in viable population of the three species was noted on inoculated pecan halves stored at -18, -7, and 5 C for 32 weeks. Due to organoleptic quality deterioration in pecan nutmeats at elevated temperatures, sterilization methods other than thermal treatment appear to be required for the elimination of viable salmonellae from pecan nuts.",

Tests of surface washings of commercially treated pecans showed a reduction of 96% in coliform bacteria following PO treatment. Under controlled laboratory conditions, PO gave 80 to 92% reduction of surface microflora and at least 64% reduction of internal flora, but neither bacteria nor fungi could be eliminated completely, even with high dosages. Current assay methods for determining bacterial content of nutmeats were shown to be inadequate because they utilize only surface washings and thus do not give an accurate picture of the total bacterial population of the nutmeat. Consequently, such assays do not permit an accurate assessment of any potential health hazard related to these organisms.",
