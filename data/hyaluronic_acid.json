      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:  This study aims to compare the regenerative effects of various by-products of human leukocyte platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF), including L-PRF exudate, concentrated PRF (C-PRF), and a mixture of the two, with hyaluronic acid (HA) specifically for interdental papillae reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The L-PRF was obtained by centrifuging 10 mL of human blood in a fixed-angle centrifuge at 2,700 rpm for 12 minutes. After centrifugation, the L-PRF layer was separated, and platelet and leukocyte counts were performed. An in vivo study was conducted using Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to a modified open gingival embrasure (OGE) model for 7 days. Once the OGE was established, 20 µL of L-PRF exudate (n = 3), C-PRF (n = 3), a combination of L-PRF exudate and C-PRF (n = 3), HA (n = 3), and phosphate-buffered saline (n = 3) were injected 2 mm from the tip of the papillae using a 30G syringe. Clinical parameters, including OGE width and spring papilla distance (SPD), were observed on days 7 and 14. On day 14, histological observations included fibroblast count, blood vessel presence, epithelial width, and collagen density, while proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression was assessed immunohistochemically. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  The SPD on day 7, along with all histological and immunohistochemical data, were normally distributed and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference test. In contrast, the Kruskal-Wallis' test was used to analyze the OGE width and SPD on day 14, which was not normally distributed. RESULTS:  The cell counts indicated that most platelets and leukocytes were in the C-PRF layer. The L-PRF membrane by-product increased fibroblast proliferation more effectively than HA (p < 0.05). Only C-PRF significantly enhanced the vascularization and epithelialization of the papillae (p < 0.05). However, the observed cellular and molecular changes increased at day 7 postinjection and did not impact collagen density or interdental papilla height. CONCLUSION:  The regenerative effect of C-PRF injection is superior to that of HA and other L-PRF by-products, as it promotes papillae regeneration by enhancing fibroblast activity, vascularization, and epithelialization. These findings show the potential impact of L-PRF by-products as a nonsurgical papillae reconstruction treatment."

Developed liposomal formulations show sustained release behaviour as compared to free DOX (96.7 ± 1.81% release in 12 h), as indicated by the release kinetics metrics (82.8 ± 2.82% & 69.8 ± 2.25% releases in 72 h of HA-DOX-TPGS-LIPO and DOX-TPGS-LIPO respectively). In vitro cytotoxicity by MTT assay on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrated that HA-DOX-TPGS-LIPO had significantly higher cytotoxicity and a clear synergistic impact over free drug or DOX-TPGS-LIPO respectively. Higher cell internalization of HA-DOX-TPGS-LIPO was seen in an in vitro cellular uptake assay in contrast to free drug and DOX-TPGS-LIPO investigated by FACS analysis. ROS production was also assessed using 2', 7'-Dichlorofluorescin diacetates (DCFDA) in the FACS study. Upon treatment with HA-DOX-TPGS-LIPO, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells showed a higher ROS generation than free DOX and DOX-TPGS-LIPO. Moreover, the expression of the NF-κB protein was also analyzed as a possible substitute mechanism for apoptosis. Free DOX treatment resulted in the maximum expression of NF-κB protein, whereas the HA-DOX-TPGS-LIPO formulation showed the minimum expression of NF-κB protein at the same concentration of DOX-TPGS-LIPO. The study suggested that HA-tethered developed liposomal formulation could be an effective tumor treatment and may be a valuable targeted nanocarrier."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Fibrosis of hepatic parenchyma has been reported as a common pathway to complications of chronic liver disease. There is a need to monitor fibrosis in these patients to abort or delay disease progression following treatment. Liver biopsy is recognized as the gold standard for disease monitoring; however, the procedure is invasive and bedeviled with potential complications. For these reasons, non-invasive biomarkers of fibrosis are now being evaluated as alternatives to liver biopsy. The study aimed to assess the characteristics of laminin, and hyaluronic acid as markers of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B. METHODOLOGY: One hundred participants with HBV-induced chronic liver disease (CLD) were recruited for the study. A liver biopsy was conducted, and the degree of hepatic fibrosis was scored using the Metavir scoring system. Serum levels of the biomarkers were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Medians and interquartile ranges were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The degree of correlation between continuous variables was determined using Spearman's correlation analysis. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: Serum laminin was significantly higher in participants with hepatic fibrosis: 39.09 (27.6-89.4) ng/ml [median (interquartile range)], vs 24.3 (21.5-31.9) ng/ml, p = 0.001, Hyaluronic acid was significantly higher in participants with hepatic fibrosis: 45.1 (26.9-94.4) ng/ml vs 23.1 (12.7-35.7) ng/ml, p < 0.001. There was a strong significant positive correlation of both serum laminin and hyaluronic acid with Metavir score in the study participants (r=0.766, p<0.001; r=0.708, p<0.001 respectively). At a serum laminin concentration of 44.6 ng/ml, sensitivity and specificity for detecting moderate to severe hepatic fibrosis were 86.8% and 88.7% respectively, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.943 on the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve. The sensitivity and specificity of hyaluronic acid for detecting moderate to severe hepatic fibrosis were 81.6% and 85.5% at a serum concentration of 53.5 ng/ml. AUC was 0.930 on the ROC curve. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the evidence that laminin and hyaluronic acid may be helpful clinically in identifying patients with moderate to severe hepatic fibrosis. Serum laminin had a slightly better diagnostic ability than hyaluronic acid in the study participants. Further studies are needed to elucidate our findings."

Although surgical rhinoplasty remains the gold standard for nasal reconstruction and correction, HA fillers provide a minimally invasive alternative with immediate results and a low morbidity rate. This study aimed to evaluate the proposed non-surgical rhinoplasty algorithm, which focuses on the correction of 4 specific anatomic points, by assessing aesthetic outcomes, patient satisfaction, and associated complications. Horizontal and vertical sagittal stability were monitored using profilometric Arnett analysis, focusing on measurements of the Nasion (Na), Rhinion (Rh), Pronasion (Prn), and Subnasal (Sn). The application of the 4 anatomic point treatment algorithm demonstrated significant improvements in nasal profile and overall facial harmony. This technique offers a safe and effective solution, avoiding the challenges associated with surgical interventions, such as scarring and general anesthesia, while ensuring high patient satisfaction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various therapeutic options have been introduced for enlarged facial pores including low cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers. Newer formulations of HA-based dermal fillers are continuously introduced into the market, but their effectiveness in reducing enlarged facial pores has not yet been determined. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of HA-based dermal fillers (Cohesive Polydensified Matrix HA filler; CPM-HA20) versus CPM-HA20 with glycerol (CPM-HA20G) in terms of minimizing enlarged facial pores and skin quality improvement. METHODS: Thirty subjects with enlarged facial pores were enrolled in this randomized, double-blinded, split-face study. Participants were randomly assigned to be injected with 1 mL of CPM-HA20 filler on one side of their medial cheek and 1 mL of CPM-HA20G on the contralateral side for 3 sessions spaced 4 weeks apart. Pore volume was objectively measured by an Antera 3D. Skin biophysical properties were evaluated. Participant satisfaction and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-nine participants completed the study. Both treatment groups showed a reduction in the mean pore volume from the baseline through Week 32. The CPM-HA20G treated side showed a 24.2% higher reduction in mean pore volume from baseline compared to the CPM-HA20 treated side (p = 0.038). Both treatment groups showed improvement in skin hydration from baseline to Week 32. There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between the CPM-HA20G and CPM-HA20 treated sides. Only mild adverse events such as pain, edema, and bruising were reported. CONCLUSION: Three-monthly injections of CPM-HA20G and CPM-HA20 were effective in minimizing enlarged face pores and improving skin hydration. CPM-HA20G demonstrated superior efficacy in terms of pore size reduction. Adverse events were generally mild and tolerable.",

      "abstract": "Background: Periodontitis is a prevalent inflammatory condition that destroys periodontal tissues. Scaling and root planing (SRP) is the gold standard for non-surgical treatment; however, its efficacy may be limited in cases with complex dental issues. This umbrella review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid (HA) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in enhancing clinical outcomes for periodontitis management. Methods: A comprehensive review of five systematic reviews, including meta-analyses where available, was conducted to synthesize evidence on the adjunctive use of HA with SRP. The studies were evaluated using the AMSTAR-2 quality assessment tool to determine methodological rigor. Data on clinical parameters such as probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival index (GI), and plaque index (PI) were extracted and analyzed. Results: The findings indicate that HA supplementation leads to moderate improvements in PD, CAL, BOP, GI, and PI compared to SRP alone. Notable reductions in PD and gains in CAL were observed, with some meta-analyses showing statistically significant benefits. However, the heterogeneity in HA concentrations (0.2-1.4%), application methods, treatment frequencies, and follow-up durations (1 week to 12 months) limits definitive conclusions. Additionally, HA did not significantly affect the reduction in P. gingivalis prevalence. Conclusions: The use of HA in conjunction with SRP shows promise in enhancing the efficacy of non-surgical periodontal therapy. However, the heterogeneity in the quality and methodologies of the studies indicates the necessity for high-quality, standardized randomized controlled trials to establish clear clinical guidelines for the application of HA in the treatment of periodontitis."

      "abstract": "Bacterial infections pose a significant global health challenge aggravated by the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Among the obstacles preventing effective treatment are biological barriers (BBs) within the body such as the mucus layer. These BBs trap antimicrobials, necessitating higher doses and ultimately accelerating AMR. Addressing this issue requires innovative therapeutic strategies capable of bypassing BBs to deliver drugs more effectively. Here, we present nanomotors (NMs) based on hyaluronic acid (HA)- and urease-nanogels (NGs) as a solution to navigate effectively in viscous media by catalyzing the decomposition of urea into ammonium and carbon dioxide. These HA-based nanomotors (HA-NMs) were loaded with chloramphenicol (CHL) antibiotic and demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli(E. coli) compared to mesoporous silica NMs (MSNP-NMs), a reference in the field of NMs. Moreover, using an in vitro transwell model we evaluated the ability of HA-NMs to penetrate mucin barriers, effectively reducing E. coli proliferation, whereas the free antibiotic did not reduce bacteria proliferation. The optical density reduction at 24 h was over ten times greater than with free CHL. These organic-based enzyme-powered NMs represent a significant advancement in drug delivery, offering a promising approach to combat AMR while addressing the challenges of crossing complex BBs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Facial aging entails complex alterations across various tissues, prompting individuals to seek aesthetic interventions. The anatomical complexities of the facial upper third and its proximity to vital vascular structures provide inherent risks. We aim to identify and elucidate the safety considerations and avenues for improvement regarding established injection sites and techniques for hyaluronic acid fillers in this area, encompassing the forehead and temporal region. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and OpenGrey. Eligible studies were analyzed for injection sites, techniques, safety considerations, and anatomical landmarks. Qualitative synthesis and critical appraisal were used to identify trends, variations, and areas of consensus or controversy. Additionally, medical illustrations were created to deliver a practical overview. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist and the Joanna Briggs Institute's scoping review recommendations. RESULTS: We included 7 studies in the review. Common injection sites included frontal and temporal regions, with variations in techniques noted across studies. Trends in filler placement and techniques were observed alongside several areas of controversy requiring further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: We underscore the absence of a standardized approach to hyaluronic acid filler injection sites and techniques for the facial upper third. Integrating anatomical knowledge with empirical evidence will be paramount in developing standardized techniques that prioritize patient safety and enhance treatment efficacy."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 62 patients with ADDWoR admitted to our hospital from April 2023 to June 2024. According to the treatment method received, patients were divided into a control group (n=31, treated with occlusal splints) and an observation group (n=31, treated with occlusal splints combined with intra-articular injection of HA). The clinical treatment effects, pain levels (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]), temporomandibular joint dysfunction (Friction Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction Index [CMI]), mandibular movement function (maximum mouth opening [MMO], left lateral excursion [LLE], right lateral excursion [RLE], protrusive movement [PM]), clinical aesthetic indicators (condylar height, joint space width), and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: (1) Clinical Efficacy: The observation group had a higher total effective rate (90.32% vs 67.74%, P < 0.05). (2) Pain & Dysfunction: Both groups showed significant improvement in VAS and CMI scores over time, with the observation group exhibiting greater reductions (P < 0.05). (3) Mandibular Function & Aesthetic Indicators: The observation group had greater improvements in MMO, LLE, RLE, PM, condylar height, and joint space width (P < 0.05). (4) Adverse Reactions: No significant difference in adverse reaction rates (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of intra-articular injection of HA with occlusal splint therapy can further improve the treatment outcomes for ADDWoR patients, alleviate pain, improve temporomandibular joint dysfunction and mandibular movement function, promote aesthetic recovery, and does not increase the risk of adverse reactions."

AIMS: This study aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy of three distinct treatment modalities for neck wrinkles: AS, HA injections, and a combination of both. The primary objective is to determine which treatment approach offers the most effective and satisfactory outcomes in terms of wrinkle reduction and skin rejuvenation. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 30 female participants with neck Allergan Transverse Neck Lines Scale (ATNLS) scores ranging from 3 to 4 were randomly allocated into three treatment groups: AS, HA, and AS+HA. Each participant received treatment once a month for 3 months, followed by clinical assessments at 1 month and 6 months posttreatment. The assessments included ATNLS scores, Global Aesthetic Improvement Scores (GAIS), and analysis of skin elasticity and collagen levels. RESULTS: All treatment groups demonstrated improvements in ATNLS scores and GAIS after the final treatment. Notably, the AS+HA group showed a significantly higher number of participants reporting beneficial results at the 6-month follow-up. This group also exhibited a statistically significant increase in skin elasticity and collagen levels compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: The combined approach of HA and acupotomy subcision is effective in treating horizontal neck wrinkles, leading to significant improvements in skin elasticity and collagen levels. This study suggests that the synergistic effect of AS and HA may enhance the overall efficacy of treatments for reducing neck wrinkles, providing a promising option for patients seeking noninvasive neck rejuvenation.",

STUDY DESIGN: Patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiochemotherapy (RCT) were randomized into two groups: group A, patients that received PBM + POCP (n = 24), and group B, patients that received PBM + POCP + L-G + HA (n = 24). OM was assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and World Health Organization (WHO) scales. The impact of oral health on patients' quality of life and perception of OM symptoms was evaluated. Assessments were made at the 1st, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 30th radiotherapy (RT) sessions. RESULTS: When the severity of OM was assessed according to the WHO scale in the 30th RT, group B showed lower rates of severe OM than group A. There were no differences when using the NCI scale. The impact of oral health on quality of life and the symptoms reported by patients were lower in group B at all times evaluated. CONCLUSION: The combination of PBM + POCP + L-G + HA resulted in a significantly lower severity of OM than PBM + POCP alone, according to the WHO scale at the 30th RT.

      "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis is a widespread disease with an insufficiently studied pathogenesis that affects various age groups and leads to progressive disappearance of hyaline cartilage with a severe impairment of function. In some cases, it requires a radical treatment - endoprotestics. Among conservative methods of osteoarthritis treatment intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid preparations are often used alongside with drug therapy. We present a case of granulomatous osteitis of the proximal tibial epiphysis caused by the injection of hyaluronic acid in a patient with severe osteoarthritis. X-ray examination revealed apparent dystrophic-degenerative changes in the left knee joint and the cancellous bone of the proximal tibial epiphysis in the patient. Macro- and microscopic examination showed absence of articular cartilage on a large area of the joint surface and its partial replacement by fibrous cartilage. Microscopic examination and scanning electron microscopy of the cancellous bone of the left proximal tibial epiphysis revealed fields of homogeneous gel-like, electron-transparent substance with a giant cell reaction to it. We present the first case in Russia of osteitis of the proximal tibial epiphysis due to intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid in a patient with severe osteoarthritis.",

The study investigates the in vitro fungicidal and bactericidal properties of this solution against clinically relevant fungal and bacterial strains and its impact on conjunctival flora in vivo. Methods: The in vitro assessment included time-kill assays to determine the fungicidal or fungistatic activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus fumigatus. The bactericidal activity was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. In vivo, 43 patients undergoing cataract surgery were treated with the solution for three days preoperatively. Results: Corneial MED® demonstrated a fungistatic effect against C. albicans and A. fumigatus, while it exhibited limited activity against A. flavus. The tested solution effectively reduced bacterial load within minutes, outperforming competitor ophthalmic solutions in activity against P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Conjunctival swabs indicated a significant reduction in bacterial load post-treatment, confirming the solution's efficacy in reducing potential ocular pathogens. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential of PHMB-based antiseptic solutions as a viable alternative to traditional disinfectants, particularly for preoperative prophylaxis and infection control. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm long-term safety and efficacy. The combination with cross-linked hyaluronic acid not only enhances tolerability but also extends antimicrobial action, making it a promising candidate for ophthalmic disinfection."

      "abstract": "Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive cartilage breakdown, synovial inflammation, and pain, which leads to significant disability. IAHA is widely used because of its viscoelastic properties, which restore synovial fluid homeostasis and reduce symptoms. However, emerging evidence suggests that IAHA exerts additional biological effects including chondroprotection, inflammatory modulation, oxidative stress reduction, and pain modulation, which may influence disease progression. Objective: This narrative review examines the biological mechanisms underlying IAHA's role in OA management. The review explored IAHA's effects on synovial fluid viscoelasticity, inflammatory cytokine modulation, cartilage preservation, oxidative stress regulation, and pain pathways, emphasizing the influence of molecular weight variations on therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, this review evaluates IAHA's integration into multimodal treatment strategies, its potential disease-modifying effects, and future directions for personalized treatment approaches. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between January 2000 and March 2024. The search focused on IAHA's molecular, cellular, and biochemical effects in OA and clinical findings assessing its impact on joint function, pain relief, and disease progression. Results: IAHA improves synovial fluid lubrication, reduces proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α), inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), and modulates nociceptive pathways. High-molecular-weight IAHA demonstrates superior efficacy in advanced OA, while low-molecular-weight formulations may be better suited for early-stage disease. Although IAHA's symptom relief is comparable to corticosteroids and NSAIDs, its favorable safety profile and emerging disease-modifying potential support its long-term use in OA management. Conclusions: IAHA represents a multifaceted therapeutic approach bridging symptomatic relief and regenerative strategies. While long-term efficacy, optimal administration protocols, and patient-specific responses remain subjects of ongoing research, refining treatment selection criteria, dosing regimens, and combination strategies may enhance clinical outcomes. Future studies should explore biomarker-driven approaches, standardize treatment protocols, and assess IAHA's synergy with regenerative medicine to optimize its role in OA management."

      "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers offer a minimally invasive alternative for breast augmentation, appealing to young female patients seeking natural results and minimal recovery time. However, achieving optimal outcomes requires a thorough understanding of breast anatomy, filler properties, and safe injection techniques. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the anatomical considerations, techniques, and filler properties necessary for optimal breast augmentation using HA filler. It also explores patient selection, long-term safety and efficacy, and the management of complications. A review of key anatomical structures, including glandular tissue, fascial layers, vascular anatomy, and Cooper's ligaments was conducted. Injection techniques, such as dual-plane and submuscular approaches, were analysed with a focus on pre-procedural imaging. Four cases of young female patients undergoing breast augmentation using HA filler (e.p.t.q. eve X, Jetema Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea) were analysed. The efficacy of HA fillers in achieving natural breast enhancement was demonstrated in all four cases. Ultrasound played a crucial role in ensuring accurate filler placement, reducing risks like vascular occlusion and filler migration. Patients reported high satisfaction and minimal complications, though periodic treatments were required for maintenance. HA filler-based breast augmentation is a safe and effective option for young female patients, delivering natural results with rapid recovery. Although the results can be temporary and maintenance treatment is required, HA fillers may offer a non-invasive alternative to silicone implants. Optimal outcomes can be achieved through a thorough understanding of anatomy, the use of highly cohesive fillers, and ultrasound-guided injection techniques."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The additional use of agents with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, such as hyaluronic acid in treating periodontal disease, has recently become popular. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of using an interdental brush dipped in 0.2% HA gel on clinical periodontal parameters. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted among 60 patients with stages II/III grades A/B periodontitis. After full-mouth scaling root planning and oral hygiene training, the patients were divided into two groups; the test group was asked to use an interdental brush dipped in 0.2% HA, while the control group was asked to use a regular interdental brush. Clinical periodontal parameters [ gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI), papillary bleeding index (PBI), pocket depth (PD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL) ] were assessed at baseline and in the 1st and 3rd months after treatment. RESULTS: Clinical periodontal parameters were improved in control and test groups at the 1 and 3-month compared to baseline (p < 0.05). The 1st- and 3rd-month PBIs were significantly lower in the test group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the test and control groups regarding PI, PD, GI, and CAL between the follow-up times. CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical efficacy of the tested methods of interdental brush use was similar, it can be concluded that the use of an interdental brush dipped in HA may contribute to the reduction of gingival bleeding in the early period. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Incorporating HA into the oral hygiene regime after periodontitis treatment using an interdental brush is a useful and practical method.

      "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment poses significant challenges to reactive oxygen species treatment, and fails to retain small molecule drugs for extended periods, leading to low treatment efficacy. Here, a hyaluronic acid-based nanoplatform (HCCD) for combined chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is developed. The nanoplatform links chlorin e6 (Ce6) and doxorubicin (DOX) with hyaluronic acid through a glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide bond, resulting their fluorescence quenching. Notably, their fluorescence and cytotoxicity are specifically activated in tumor cells, not normal ones, due to the endogenous GSH-mediated cleavage of disulfide bonds. Furthermore, PDT is activated in tumor cells with 660 nm laser, and GSH consumption reshapes redox homeostasis balance, thereby synergistically enhancing the anti-tumor efficacy with chemotherapy. HCCD predominantly accumulates in tumors in vivo, enabling precise localization and guidance for PDT and chemotherapy. This approach results in a significant reduction in tumor size, by a factor of 11 compared to the control group, with tumors nearly disappearing. Additionally, HCCD with the toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod (R837) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) activated systemic immune response, suppressing distant tumor growth. Therefore, it's a promising strategy for precise tumor targeting and combination therapy, with potential in immunotherapy to inhibit primary and metastatic tumor growth."

      "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a linear, unbranched polysaccharide classified as a glycosaminoglycan. While HA is found in various tissues throughout the body, over half of its total proportion is found in the skin. The role of HA in the skin is complex and multifaceted. HA maintains proper hydration, elasticity, and skin firmness, serving as a key extracellular matrix (ECM) component. With age, HA production gradually decreases, leading to reduced water-binding capacity, drier and less elastic skin, and the formation of wrinkles. Additionally, HA plays an active role in the wound-healing process at every stage. This review summarizes the current background knowledge about the role of HA in skin aging and wound healing. We discuss the latest applications of HA in aging prevention, including anti-aging formulations, nutricosmetics, microneedles, nanoparticles, HA-based fillers, and skin biostimulators. Furthermore, we explore various HA-based dressings used in wound treatment, such as hydrogels, sponges, membranes, and films."

      "abstract": "As dressings for moist wound healing, hyaluronic acid hydrogels play a significant role in maintaining moisture and promoting wound healing. However, existing hydrogel dressings are inadequate in terms of slow gelation time, weak mechanical performance, and fast degradation, which increases the risk of secondary infections during treatment. Therefore, we developed a hyaluronic acid double network hydrogel (DNH). Compared to single-network hydrogels (hydrazone and Diels-Alder), DNH shows a short gelation time (25 s) and strong mechanical properties (Young's modulus = 82 kPa). These advantages enable DNH to immediately fill the irregular shape of the wound after gelation and remain intact after being squeezed. Swelling tests indicated that DNH had a suitable swelling ratio and maintained its structural integrity after swelling. We evaluated the use of DNH as a moist dressing for full-thickness wound healing in vivo. DNH-treated wounds healed faster, with enhanced blood vessel formation and macrophage polarization than gauze-treated wounds. These findings suggest that DNH not only accelerates wound healing but also improves tissue regeneration. Therefore, DNH may be a suitable moist dressing for wound healing."

Pyroptosis, a type of immunogenic cell death, significantly enhances antitumor immunity by triggering the release of numerous intracellular components. Here, we prepared a covalent-organic framework (COF) loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and coated it with hyaluronic acid (HA) as a therapeutic delivery system (HA@DOX-COF) for the treatment of TNBC. Mechanistically, upon cellular uptake, HA@DOX-COF activated pyroptosis through the caspase-3/GSDME pathway. Moreover, HA@DOX-COF induced a pyroptosis-induced antitumor immune response and further augmented the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Our results demonstrated that the combination of HA@DOX-COF and an anti-PD-1 antibody markedly inhibited tumor progression in a TNBC murine model. Overall, our work offers a potential approach for pyroptosis-induced immunotherapy for TNBC, which may increase the efficacy of ICB-based immunotherapy."

DESIGN: Two-step study comprising a 12-week randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind phase, followed by an open-label phase. Eligible postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy were randomised (2:1) to a single injection session of either hyaluronic acid or placebo. This is the report of the single-blind phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean change in the severity score for the most bothersome symptom at 12 weeks compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes included differences in scores for individual vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms, score on the Female Sexual Function Index and vaginal pH. RESULTS: A total of 116 of the 117 patients in the randomised population contributed outcome data to the study (79 receiving hyaluronic acid and 37 placebo). Compared with baseline, the mean score for the severity of the most bothersome symptom was significantly reduced in the hyaluronic acid arm at 12 weeks (between-group difference [95 % confidence interval]: -0.58 [-1.01; -0.16], p = 0.008). Similarly, there were significant reductions in mean scores for dryness (-0.87 [-1.27; -0.47]; p < 0.001) and dyspareunia (-0.65 [-1.09; -0.21]; p = 0.004) and improvement in score on the Female Sexual Function Index (3.81 [0.91; 6.72]; p = 0.011) in the hyaluronic acid group. There were no differences in itching/irritation, pain or vaginal pH in either group. Hyaluronic acid treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: A single injection session of cross-linked hyaluronic acid is effective in reducing vulvovaginal symptoms and sexual dysfunction compared with placebo at 12 weeks, making it a suitable management option for moderate to severe vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) against corticosteroid injections in adult patients with adhesive capsulitis (AC), in impacting pain relief and range of motion (ROM). LITERATURE SURVEY: A systematic review was conducted between January and February 2024 through PubMed and Google Scholar using the following keywords: \"PRP,\" \"Hyaluronic Acid,\" \"Bone Marrow Aspirate,\" \"Frozen Shoulder,\" \"Periarthritis,\" \"Adhesive Capsulitis,\" and \"Corticosteroid Injections.\" Inclusion criteria were studies published between January 2019 and February 2024 and used corticosteroids as a comparison for orthobiologic treatment. The initial search yielded 47 studies, refined to 21 after applying eligibility criteria. Ultimately, six studies were selected. METHODOLOGY: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, a Cochrane Risk of Bias analysis was performed, and data were independently extracted by multiple authors. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the efficacy of PRP and HA against corticosteroids measured by visual analog scale (VAS), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), and UCLA Shoulder scores. SYNTHESIS: Qualitatively, studies with 3 months or longer patient follow-ups demonstrated better long-term efficacy in pain reduction and ROM improvement with PRP or HA injections. A 6-month improvement in pain as measured by VAS had a significant standardized mean difference (SMD) of -1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.56 to 1.04). There were significant improvements in functional outcomes at 6 months in DASH (SMD of -1.23 [95% CI, -1.71 to -0.74]) and UCLA Shoulder scores (SMD of 0.74 [95% CI, 0.47-1.00]): No significant differences were observed in 3-month outcomes: DASH (SMD of -0.12 [95% CI, -0.54 to 0.30]) and SPADI scores (SMD of -0.34 [95% CI, -0.78 to 0.10]). Cochrane analysis identified one study with high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: The review highlights orthobiologics as a promising alternative to corticosteroid injections in managing AC, with PRP providing more long-term pain relief compared to corticosteroid injections. Improvements in shoulder ROM were also seen but require further studies to determine their significance. However, substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 50) was observed, underscoring the need for future research to standardize methodologies and improve consistency."

      "abstract": "The treatment of volumetric muscle loss (VML) is challenging owing to the deficiency of appropriate bioscaffolds and ineffective therapeutic outcomes with conventional approaches. Adhesive hydrogels have emerged as potential tools for promoting tissue regeneration, offering effective integration with damaged tissues. However, technical procedures requiring non-biocompatible crosslinking methods, mechanical mismatches, or the absence of tissue-specific microenvironments in conventional adhesive hydrogels have hindered their successful application in tissue reconstruction. In this study, a patch-type adhesive hydrogel is developed by combining a muscle tissue-derived extracellular matrix (MEM) and catechol-conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA-CA). This MEM-containing HA-CA (HCM) patch hydrogel utilizes MEM as both a biocompatible crosslinker and a therapeutic substance. The HCM patch hydrogel, crosslinked through a combination of covalent and non-covalent interactions via MEM and catechol in the composite, not only provides stable physical support but also develops muscle tissue-specific biochemical cues, mediating the recruitment and maturation of muscular cells. In animal models of VML, the HCM patch hydrogel effectively stimulates satellite cells and supports de novo muscle regeneration with functional restoration. This study emphasizes the efficacy and ready-to-use convenience of HCM patch hydrogels for muscle regeneration."

These multilamellar vesicles exhibit enhanced T2-weighted MRI contrast, achieving a relaxivity 3-fold higher than existing agents. The polymersomes demonstrate acid- and enzyme-triggered degradation, enabling controlled release and measurable contrast changes in pathological environments.

      "abstract": "This study investigates the molecular mechanisms by which selenide-modified hyaluronic acid hydrogel (Se-HA gel) promotes scleral remodeling during the recovery phase of form-deprivation myopia (FDM). The Se-HA gel was synthesized and characterized, exhibiting an average hydrodynamic diameter of 191.72 nm, a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.19, and a zeta potential of -7.96 mV, indicating a monodisperse state in PBS. Both in vitro experiments and the FDM mouse model confirmed its therapeutic efficacy. At a concentration of 250 μg/mL, Se-HA gel significantly promoted fibroblast proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and prevented transdifferentiation. A 200 mg/kg subtenon injection improved key ocular biometric parameters in FDM mice. Single-cell and transcriptomic sequencing analyses revealed that Se-HA gel facilitated scleral remodeling by downregulating Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Alpha (HIF-1α) expression and regulating inflammation-related gene expression. Notably, HIF-1α overexpression reversed the beneficial effects of Se-HA gel, reinforcing its pivotal role in mediating these therapeutic outcomes. This study introduces a novel biomaterial-based strategy and identifies new molecular targets for myopia treatment. Furthermore, it addresses a critical gap in understanding how Se-HA gel promotes scleral remodeling through HIF-1α-mediated signaling pathways, with important scientific and translational potential in the field of myopia management."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of acellular hyaluronic acid matrix scaffold, BMAC, and autologous bone graft in providing biomechanical support and optimal microenvironment for OLTs treatment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 81 ankles from 80 patients treated between 2018 and 2021 was conducted. The inclusion criteria included patients who underwent surgery for osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs) and received acellular hyaluronic acid matrix scaffold, bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) fibrin glue, and autologous bone graft. The exclusion criteria included prior ankle surgery, concurrent lateral instability surgery, malignancy, metabolic bone disease, or related medication. Clinical outcomes were assessed with FAOS, VAS, and SF-36 at a minimum of two years postoperatively. MRI findings were evaluated preoperatively, at six months, and 24 months postoperatively via MOCART. Subgroups were formed on the basis of age (< 45 vs. ≥45), BMI, and full weight bearing mobilization (FWBM) timing (4, 5, 6, or > 6 weeks). RESULTS: Postoperative FAOS and SF-36 scores significantly improved (p = 0.000), whereas VAS scores decreased (p = 0.001). Early FWBM (4th week) was associated with superior FAOS, SF-36, and MOCART scores at 24 months (p = 0.039). Underweight and healthy individuals exhibited lower VAS (p = 0.001) and higher SF-36 scores (p = 0.000) at three months, alongside higher MOCART scores at 24 months compared to overweight patients (p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of a tailored approach to optimize the microenvironment and biomechanical support in OLTs treatment. Further research is required to refine therapeutic strategies."

Nanomicelles containing saponin, glycerol, and vitamin-E TPGS formulation of capecitabine were further encapsulated with hyaluronic acid (HA) for CD44 receptor-mediated targeting. Optimization of the formulation was carried out using a Box-Behnken design resulting in 17.8 nm particle size, 89.3% entrapment efficiency and a biphasic drug release profile. Characterization studies validated stability, spherical structure, and desirable encapsulation characteristics of the nanomicelles. Lowered critical micelle concentration (CMC) and acceptable drug release kinetics revealed improved thermodynamic stability and controlled drug release, as predicted by the Hixson-Crowell model. HA-CAP-M showed much higher permeability and cytotoxicity than the free CAP, with an IC50 of 2.964 μg mL-1 in in vitro experiments. AO/PI staining also demonstrated dose-dependent apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and validated the highly effective active targeting of HA. In addition, the formulation demonstrated good stability during storage and dilution conditions, confirming its stability as a drug delivery platform. In conclusion, HA-functionalized nanomicelles provide a biocompatible and efficient system for the targeted breast cancer therapy, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of capecitabine."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal fillers are primarily utilized for restoring volume loss and for the correction of wrinkles and folds. While HA injections are generally considered safe, undesirable and serious complications have been on the rise due to the increased frequency of these procedures. Late-onset complications involve filler migration, foreign body granuloma reactions, delayed hypersensitivity reactions, and infections, among others. AIMS/OBJECTIVES: Raising awareness about late complications associated with HA filler injections and highlighting proper management strategies. METHODS: We hereby present three patients who experienced distinct forms of delayed reactions to HA fillers, provide a systematic approach to their evaluation, and outline effective treatment strategies to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of the details of their medical cases and any accompanying images. RESULTS: Delayed complications to HA fillers include erythema, edema, inflammation, nodules, and infections. These late-onset reactions present weeks to months post-injection and may be influenced by immune responses, filler properties, and procedural factors. Ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool in diagnosing and managing these complications, guiding treatments such as hyaluronidase and corticosteroid injections. Preventive measures, including aseptic techniques, patient screening, and proper injector training, help in reducing risks and optimizing patient outcomes. CONCLUSION: HA filler injections remain among the most popular cosmetic procedures, generally offering safe outcomes when performed by skilled professionals. Complications may still occur and require prompt recognition and management. This article highlights the importance of imaging in diagnosing non-ischemic complications and provides practical recommendations for managing delayed HA filler reactions. Ensuring patient safety relies on proper training, adherence to aseptic techniques, and careful patient and product selection.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of biocompatible hyaluronic acid-stabilized copper nanoparticles (HA-CuNPs) and their catalytic evaluation in the oxidation of morin as a model compound. HA-CuNPs have been characterized by several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, such as FESEM, STEM, UV-Vis, DLS, zeta potential, FTIR and XRD analyses. The average particle size and surface zeta potential of HA-CuNPs were determined to be 35 nm and -28 mV, respectively. The catalytic activity of HA-CuNPs was investigated in the oxidative degradation of morin dye in the presence of H2O2. The kinetic data show that the oxidation process follows a pseudo-first-order reaction, and the rate constant is dependent on the concentrations of morin, H2O2, and HA-CuNPs. In addition, HA-CuNPs were employed for the selective oxidation of morin on four important synthetic dyes, i.e., Congo red, methylene blue, zinc-phthalocyanine, and quinizarin. The high selectivity indicates the possible use of HA-CuNPs as low-temperature bleach catalysts for the oxidation of stains such as tea, coffee, and red wine, which contain polyphenolic compounds like morin. Further, cytotoxicity studies demonstrated the low toxicity and high biocompatibility of HA-CuNPs to Caco-2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, and HUVEC normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Combining biocompatibility with high catalytic activity could boost the potential of this eco-friendly nanocatalyst in various applications, such as wastewater treatment, laundry, textile, and wood pulp bleaching."

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition, often caused by C. acnes infection. While ZnO has shown promise as an antibacterial agent in acne treatment, concerns over toxicity and non-selective bacterial killing remain. In this study we developed a hyaluronic acid-stabilized nano‑zinc oxide (HA-ZnO) formulation aimed at enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of ZnO for acne treatment. HA-ZnO was synthesized through biomimetic mineralization. HA-ZnO targeted acne-prone areas, especially sebaceous glands, without skin penetration. HA-ZnO demonstrated selective antibacterial activity against C. acnes, exhibiting a killing efficacy more than 16 times greater than that against S. epidermidis. The HA coating also improved ZnO's stability in acidic conditions, mitigating potential toxicity and side effects. Additionally, the sustained release of Zn2+ promoted cell proliferation and migration, reducing sebum secretion, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects, supporting scar-free acne repair and preventing recurrence. In preclinical models, HA-ZnO outperformed erythromycin ointment in treating acne, with no toxicity observed in zebrafish and HET-CAM. A clinical trial further confirmed its efficacy in reducing acne lesions and redness, with high safety. These results highlight HA-ZnO as a promising therapeutic strategy for acne, combining potent antibacterial and skin-repairing effects with enhanced safety."

This paper explores the effects of hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified mEXOs (HA-mEXOs) in LUAD. HA-mEXOs were isolated and prepared, and PMX-resistant cells were developed. CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell, flow apoptosis, xenograft tumor assay, immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL experiments were conducted to explore the impact of mEXOs and HA-mEXOs on malignant behaviors and PMX sensitivity. The role of ZNF516 and ABCC5 on malignant behaviors and PMX sensitivity was investigated by shRNA lentiviral infection. HA modification increased the uptake and affinity of LUAD cells for mEXOs. mEXOs induced PMX-resistant LUAD cell sensitivity and inhibited their malignant behaviors. mEXOs enhanced PMX sensitivity and inhibited tumor growth. HA-mEXOs had superior effects to mEXOs. ZNF516 was lowered in LUAD-resistant cells and upregulated by mEXOs. ZNF516 bound to the ABCC5 promoter and repressed its transcriptional activation. The combined knockdown of ZNF516 reversed the antitumor benefits of mEXOs. HA-mEXOs-carrying ZNF516 enhance ZNF516 levels in LUAD/PMX cells and repress ABCC5, which in turn induces cell sensitivity to PMX and inhibits LUAD progression.",

To solve the problem of insufficient H2O2, in this paper, a novel double-enzyme cascade nanoreactor hyaluronic-cinnamaldehyde Schiff base@glucose oxidase (GOx)/copper doped carbon dot (abbreviation HCFCTG), which constructed by co-assembly of copper doped carbon dot (CuFACDs-TPP), glucose oxidase (GOx) and hyaluronic-cinnamaldehyde Schiff base (HA-CA) was designed for the first time. The HCFCTG released GOx and CuFACDs-TPP under pH stimulation. GOx continues to supply H2O2 to CDT by consuming glucose, while cutting off the supply of nutrients to starve cancer cells to death (ST), ultimately amplifying the therapeutic effect of CDT. CuFACDs-TPP precisely anchors mitochondria to destroy mitochondria and induce apoptosis, while copper ions consume glutathione to amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Self‑oxygenation of HCFCTG by Fenton-like reaction down-regulates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) to consolidate CDT effect. The 808 nm laser activates the photothermal effect enhances CDT. In vitro and in vivo experiments proved that HCFCTG has good biocompatibility and excellent CDT effect. HCFCTG overcomes the problem of insufficient H2O2 in the CDT process."

We sought to explore a novel approach for local GBM-associated TIME immunomodulation based on a synergistic combination of the repurposed chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin (DOX), which acts to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) and gemcitabine (GEM), which depletes immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We conjugated DOX and GEM to hyaluronic acid (HA) to improve efficacy, given this polymer's ability to target CD44 which are overexpressed on cancer cells. The HA-DOX and HA-GEM polymer-drug conjugates provided synergistic cytotoxic effects and maintained ICD-related properties in GBM cells compared to a combination of free drugs. HA-DOX and HA-GEM also reverted the immunosuppressive GBM-associated TIME in orthotopic GL261 tumor-bearing mice by selectively depleting MDSCs and reprogramming M2-like macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory M1-like state, resulting in controlled tumor growth. Local HA-DOX and HA-GEM delivery also increased median survival and controlled tumor growth in an immune refractory SB28-GBM orthotopic mouse GBM model. These findings highlight the potential of repurposing clinically applicable chemotherapeutics in the context of polymer-drug combination treatments for novel immunomodulation strategies in unresectable GBM, which may open new avenues for developing innovative therapies."

However, its clinical potential is compromised by low bioavailability and poor tumor targeting. We developed hyaluronic acid (HA) modified single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) for CD44 receptor-mediated targeted delivery of HJB to enhance tumor targeting and therapeutic efficacy. The generated HA-SWCNTs-HJB measured 363.9 ± 12.8 nm in size with a HJB encapsulation efficiency of 61.5 %. HA-SWCNTs-Cou6 was effectively internalized into 4 T1 cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, exhibiting a 4.23-fold increase compared to passive targeting SWCNTs-Cou6. Moreover, HA-SWCNTs-HJB exhibited higher cytotoxicity against 4 T1 cells than SWCNTs-HJB. The IC50 values at 48 h were 3.9 ± 0.5 and 5.7 ± 0.5 μM, respectively. In vivo fluorescence imaging revealed enhanced tumor accumulation in 4 T1 breast cancer-bearing mice due to CD44 receptor-mediated active targeting. Additionally, HA-SWCNTs-HJB significantly inhibited the tumor growth and suppressed breast cancer metastasis without noticeable side effects in vivo. Overall, our newly developed HJB delivery system HA-SWCNTs-HJB, may be a potential therapeutic strategy for effectively treating breast cancer growth and metastasis."

Although the activation of materials using external sources (light) is of great importance, it is obligatory to synergistically activate the internal stimuli, such as deadly free radicals and immune responses. This study aims to fabricate conformational biocompatible nanoassemblies based on in-situ grown platinum nanodots (Pt NDs) on the surface of manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoflowers, followed by hyaluronic acid (HA) encapsulation (shortly HMP), enabling chemodynamic therapy (CDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), photothermal imaging, and immunotherapy synergistically. The HMP nanocomposites with enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency could deplete GSH in the tumor microenvironment, followed by the release of Mn2+ and Pt NDs. Mn2+ could further react with H2O2 to generate hydroxyl radicals (·OH) through a Fenton-like reaction, resulting in the CDT effect. The presence of Pt NDs showed an improvement in the photothermal conversion efficiency of HMP nanoassemblies (35.46 %) towards the PTT effect. In addition to synergistic (CDT and PTT) actions in 4 T1 cells in vitro, low doses of HMP nanocomposites could stimulate the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) release and generate calreticulin (CRT) protein in tumor cells to provide necessary signals for immunotherapeutic destruction. Finally, HMP nanocomposites combined with light stimulation could effectively inhibit tumor growth in BALB/c tumor-bearing mice. In summary, the designed drug-free nanoassemblies resulted in enhanced tumor suppression through synergistic CDT, PTT, and potential immunotherapy therapeutic effects."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Combining monopolar radiofrequency (RF) with targeted ultrasound (TUS), this study investigated whether these modalities promote facial rejuvenation through the production of hyaluronic acid (HA) in human skin. METHODS: Seven subjects (51-64 years, BMI 21.1-29.8 kg/m2) were enrolled and divided into three treatment groups in this single-center study; Group A (n = 3, simultaneous RF + TUS), Group B (n = 3, stand-alone RF), and control (n = 1, no treatment). Both treated groups underwent four (4) 60-min treatments on the face delivered 7-14 days apart. Punch biopsies (3 mm in diameter) were collected from the infra-auricular area at baseline and both follow-up visits and stained for HA by using hyaluronic acid binding protein. Digital photographs were taken to document changes in visual appearance. Finally, the subjects' comfort and satisfaction were assessed. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant (p < 0.05) average increase at 1 month in the HA-stained area of +112 358.7 μm2 in group A (RF + TUS) representing an increase of 48.65%. The treatment effect peaked at 3 months with an increase of +156 345.2 μm2, corresponding to a 67.69% increase in the HA-stained area. In Group B, there was no significant difference in the average increase of the HA-stained area between 1 month (+14 830 μm2) and 3 months (+20 995 μm2) corresponding to a 6.76% and 9.56% increase, respectively. The control samples did not indicate any changes throughout the study. Digital photographs of the RF + TUS group showed both a decrease in rhytids and tighter skin. Therapies were comfortable with no adverse events. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study has shown that the combination treatment of RF + TUS has a more pronounced and sustained effect on facial rejuvenation compared to RF alone. The measurable increase in the production of HA with simultaneous use of RF + TUS peaked at a 3-month follow-up, suggesting the gradual advancement of the treatment effect and overall improvement in facial appearance.

      "abstract": "Topical instilling of commercial artificial tears (cAT, containing 0.1 % hyaluronic acid) is widely employed to alleviate clinical manifestations of mild dry eye disease (DED) by preventing the pathological change of corneal epithelium. However, it showed limited therapy effectiveness on heavy DED which has further involved corneal stroma, due to its low stroma-available for hyaluronic acid (HA) resulting from the barrier of corneal epithelium. The present study developed a new microneedle-dosage form of cAT (cAT-MN). This cAT-MN can overstride the corneal epithelium and act as a long-lasting protective agent. Compared to cAT dosing (4 times/day), cAT-MN with one treatment exerted significantly higher therapeutic effects on curbing benzalkonium chloride (BAC)-induced corneal stroma scaring as well as alleviating the DED symptoms in the first 5-day BAC exposure; whereas, showed limited effects in a 10-day BAC exposure. To expand the therapy effects, MNs containing various amounts of HA were prepared. Thereinto, HA(6 %)-MN recovered corneal damage to healthy levels, which could be attributed to adding stroma-available for HA both by increasing the amounts of HA-delivery and enhancing HA-permeation. This study explores a new drug-free microneedle-dosage form of cAT to cure corneal stroma disorders which has expanded its indication, promising a wide clinical use in ophthalmology."

The release of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) was enhanced in acidic conditions and in the presence of hyaluronidase. The microspheres also promoted osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), as evidenced by increased expression of osteogenic markers (ALP, OCN, OPN, and COL-1). In vivo, the hydrogel microspheres were tested in a rat skull defect model, showing significant bone regeneration, improved angiogenesis, and an anti-inflammatory response.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the effects of local irisin (IR) injections on closed femoral fractures in rats and to compare its efficacy to platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 64 male Wistar albino rats were divided into four equal groups: a control group that received no treatment and three experimental groups that received local injections of HA, PRP, or recombinant IR at the fracture site. All rats underwent a standard bilateral closed femoral shaft fracture and intramedullary fixation. Each group was further divided into two subgroups, sacrificed at Week 2 and Week 4. The right femurs were used for radiological examination with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and subsequent histological analysis, while the left femurs were reserved for biomechanical testing. RESULTS: By Week 2, the IR and PRP groups showed statistically significantly higher scores for the transformation of fibrous cartilage into bone tissue compared to the control group (7.88±0.6, p=0.0001, and 6±0.8, p=0.036, respectively). By Week 4, transformation scores in the IR group increased to 9.25±0.7, statistically significantly exceeding the control group (p=0.0001). Bone volume was also statistically significantly greater in the IR group (5.21±0.5 mm3 at Week 2; 5.94±0.8 mm3 at Week 4) compared to the control group (p=0.001) and the PRP group (p=0.003) at Week 2, and compared to the control group (p=0.001), the HA group (p=0.042), and the PRP group (p=0.014) at Week 4. Additionally, maximum strength in the IR group was statistically significantly higher than in the control group (p=0.0001) and the PRP group (p=0.048) at Week 2. By Week 4, the IR group was also statistically significantly higher compared to the control group (p=0.0001), the HA group (p=0.037) and the PRP group (p=0.009). CONCLUSION: The present study is one of the first to demonstrate the potential of administering local IR via injection into the fracture hematoma to accelerate fracture healing. The superior efficacy of IR over HA and PRP may be explained by its ability to enhance osteoblast activity, promote vascularization, and reduce inflammation, creating an optimal environment for bone regeneration. Unlike PRP, which primarily delivers growth factors, and HA, which supports cell migration and proliferation, IR appears to directly influence the bone microenvironment, expediting callus transformation. These findings suggest that IR may play a significant role in improving outcomes for patients at risk of delayed union. However, further clinical trials in humans are necessary to confirm its efficacy and safety for clinical applications.",

Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages exacerbate joint damage through excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages are prone to ferroptosis, limiting the long-term efficacy of existing nanozyme therapies. This study aimed to develop a novel nanocatalyst combining efficient ROS scavenging and M2 macrophage protection to synergistically regulate macrophage polarization and autophagy levels for sustained RA remission. We designed a hyaluronic acid-modified PtPdCo-CQ nanocatalyst (HPPCQ) with triple enzyme-like activities-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD). In vitro experiments demonstrated that HPPCQ activated the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway by scavenging ROS, promoted M1-to-M2 phenotypic repolarization, and protected M2 macrophages from autophagy-dependent ferroptosis via controlled release of chloroquine (CQ). In a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, HPPCQ targeted inflamed joints, significantly reducing clinical scores, synovial hyperplasia, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-1β). Histological analysis revealed markedly alleviated cartilage destruction and inflammatory infiltration in HPPCQ-treated mice. By integrating ROS scavenging, macrophage reprogramming, and ferroptosis inhibition, this work provides a novel therapeutic strategy with enhanced efficacy and durability for RA treatment."

METHOD: Embase, MEDLINE (PubMed), and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to March 13, 2023. A pharmacodynamic Bateman function model was used to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy characteristics of HA treatments as well as placebo, while a covariate model was employed to identify factors that significantly affected efficacy. RESULTS: In total, 24 101 participants with symptomatic or radiographic OA from 168 studies with aggregate data were included. Simulation analysis from the pharmacodynamic time-effect model showed that HA treatment effects plateaued at approximately 2 months. The final model analysis indicated that intra-articular injection of HA combined with corticosteroids (CS) (the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC] pain effect size [ES] = 4.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 3.0 to 5.7]) or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) (WOMAC pain ES = 4.0 [95% CI: 2.7 to 5.3]) achieved the best efficacy compared with other groups (contrast between meta-analyses: WOMAC pain ES = 1.9 [95% CI: 1.2 to 5.2]). Subgroups analysis showed that younger (age < 65), overweight (body mass index ≥ 25) knee OA patients, with more severe baseline symptoms and a lower Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade (≤ 2), could benefit more. CONCLUSION: The quantitative model suggested that HA interventions were statistically more effective than placebo, with participants receiving HA+ CS or PRP experiencing the best efficacy. Patients with lower age, higher weight, higher severity of baseline symptoms, and lower KL grade appeared to benefit more from HA treatment."

Some Chinese herbal extracts have been shown to promote hair growth, but the active ingredients are difficult to enter the dermis. Therefore, delivering the active ingredients into the dermis becomes a key factor. Herein, Platycladus orientalis leaf extract (PO-ex) was obtained using ethanol as a solvent, and then hyaluronic acid methacrylate/hyaluronic acid (HAMA/HA) hydrogel was loaded with PO-ex to prepare hyaluronic acid microneedles (PO-ex MN). The double cross-linked HAMA/HA provides sufficient mechanical strength to pierce the stratum corneum and deliver PO-ex into the dermis; PO-ex can effectively improve the environment for hair follicle cell proliferation by removing reactive oxygen free radicals; in addition, the self-repair reaction caused by microneedle mechanical stimulation activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway associated with trauma repair and promotes hair follicle growth. PO-ex MN is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of androgenic alopecia."

Despite their potential, stem cell therapy remains constrained by various limitations, including low differentiation efficiency, difficulties in guiding differentiation, proliferation control, shorter half-life of growth factors, experimental reproducibility, etc. The cellular niche environment is pivotal in effective differentiation of stem cells. Neural regeneration ventures require biomaterial-based 3D scaffolds to simulate in-vivo tissue to solve the niche environment problem. Recent breakthroughs in neural regeneration have led to the development of a biomimetic scaffolds made of Hyaluronic acid (HA) and collagen (COL) that imitate the CNS's extracellular matrix (ECM) for better neural regeneration and repair. HA and COL based scaffold creates a favourable microenvironment for cellular migration, proliferation and survival of the embedded stem cells and promotes neural regeneration. HA regulates cellular activities while COL contributes in healing CNS injuries. Therefore, the utilization of HA-COL based scaffolds is appropriate for regulating cellular responses and behaviour for neural regeneration. This review investigates the synergy between HA and COL in the context of neural-specific applications for repair, regeneration, and recovery as well as augmentation of bioactivity through fabrication techniques such as 3D bioprinting, electrospinning, etc. for neural tissue regeneration."

      "abstract": "Rationale: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease affecting cartilage, synovium and bone, that is a major cause of pain and disability. Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) derivatives, also known as viscosupplementation (VS), is a common treatment for the symptomatic management of knee OA. Despite its widespread use, the magnitude of the clinical benefit of VS remains controversial, with conflicting results due to methodological differences and possible differences in efficacy between products related to remanence and rheological properties. Methods: Here, to create an effective HA-based treatment, an injectable self-healing HA hydrogel with long-persistent radiopacity is formed by tethering a clinical iodine contrast agent to HA. The labeling conditions are tuned to obtain sufficient X-ray signal without altering the biocompatibility, rheological and injectability properties of the hydrogel. Results: The iodine labeling enabled to monitor not only delivery of the hydrogel but also its retention in mouse knees up to 5 weeks post-administration using synchrotron K-edge subtraction-computed tomography. We further demonstrated that the unique properties of this hydrogel enable creation of a transient HA network in vivo that attenuates OA progression in a mouse model of OA. Moreover, our data showed that the rate of HA-I disappearance appears to predict treatment response, likely because a rapid elimination serves as an indirect indicator of in situ inflammation. Conclusion: Collectively, these results show that our radiopaque HA-I hydrogel holds significant promise for improving patient management in the treatment of OA before clinical symptoms worsen. Its capacity for in vivo tracking over time allows for personalized treatment schedules based on observed retention and therapeutic effect. As a result, this theranostic hydrogel emerges as a strong candidate for precision medicine in OA.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Articular cartilage exhibits a low regenerative capacity and limited potential for self-renewal. Recent research has demonstrated that exosomes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) significantly enhance cartilage repair by promoting cellular proliferation, increasing extracellular matrix synthesis, and modulating the immune response. Additionally, hyaluronic acid (HA), a critical component of synovial fluid, plays a key role in facilitating cell migration. This study aims to compare the regenerative effects of Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs, MSC-derived exosomes, and their combination with hyaluronic acid in the treatment of cartilage defects. Additionally, we seek to evaluate the impact of hyaluronic acid when combined with MSCs and exosomes through histological analysis in a rat model. METHODS: In this study, full-thickness cartilage defects were created in the trochlear grooves of both distal femurs in 48 adult rats. The knees were randomly assigned to six groups: Group I: Control-saline, Group II: Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), Group III: Wharton's jelly MSC-derived exosomes (Exo), Group IV: Hyaluronic acid (HA), Group V: MSC and HA combination, and Group VI: Exo and HA combination. Each rat received a total of three intra-articular injections at weekly intervals, beginning two weeks post-surgery. Four weeks following the final injection, all rats were euthanized, and their femurs were dissected for analysis. All groups were assessed macroscopically using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scoring system, following histological staining with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and toluidine blue, and immunohistochemical staining with type II collagen antibodies. The quality of the repaired cartilage was subsequently evaluated according to the ICRS histological grading system by an independent, blinded observer. RESULTS: Macroscopic evaluations indicated that the ICRS scores of the MSC group (8.2 ± 0.7) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the control group (4.3 ± 0.7). The cartilage defects in the MSC group showed substantial repair, displaying the most effective cartilage regeneration among all groups. Furthermore, comparison between groups revealed that both the MSC and Exo groups demonstrated a higher rate of defect depth repair, a smaller demarcation border, and a smoother cartilage surface. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that exosomes are as effective as stem cell therapies in promoting cartilage repair, suggesting that exosomes may serve as a viable alternative to cell-based therapies for cartilage damage. However, the addition of hyaluronic acid to stem cells and exosomes showed no significant enhancement in cartilage repair. Our findings highlight a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osteochondral cartilage defects.",

      "abstract": "The gradual increase in ultraviolet B (UVB) health hazards to human skin, coupled with the irritation associated with existing sunscreen products, underscores the critical need for the development of natural sunscreens to combat UVB-induced photoaging. Chuanxiong oil (CXO) and hyaluronic acid (HA) possess excellent antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, which are closely linked to the mechanisms of photoaging. In this study, a composite nano-system (HA-CXO-Lip) comprising chuanxiong oil (CXO) and hyaluronic acid (HA) was initially fabricated. Subsequently, both in vitro HaCaT cell models and in vivo murine photoaging models were established to systematically evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and mechanistic actions of HA-CXO-Lip against photoaging under controlled experimental conditions. The investigation encompassed comprehensive assessments of its pharmacological effects and underlying molecular mechanisms through multimodal experimental approaches. Vitro experiments showed HA-CXO-Lip significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity. Furthermore, HA-CXO-Lip restored the levels of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), and hydroxyproline (HYP), while also decreasing the levels of lipid metabolites such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA). These findings indicate that HA-CXO-Lip effectively inhibits excessive oxidative stress. Additionally, HA-CXO-Lip inhibited apoptosis by reducing Bax levels and enhancing Bcl-2 expression in HaCaT cells. In vivo studies demonstrated that HA-CXO-Lip significantly reduced UVB irradiation-induced erythema and epidermal thickening in the backs of mice. It restored the orderly arrangement of collagen fibers and inhibited the activation of the core senescence pathway, AKT/mTOR, along with the downstream expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), resulting in a decrease in collagen I disassembly. Additionally, HA-CXO-Lip was shown to significantly decrease the number of apoptotic cells, as indicated by the expression of the apoptosis marker cleaved cysteine aspartic protease-3 (C-Caspase-3) and the surface type I transmembrane glycoprotein (CD44), thereby further inhibiting apoptosis. The findings of this study suggest that HA-CXO-Lip can exert anti-photoaging effects through its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, highlighting the synergistic efficacy of CXO and HA, which holds promise for the prevention and treatment of photoaging.",

      "abstract": "The periodontium is one of the radiation-sensitive tissues; the periodontal membrane's vascularity and cellularity were reduced, and the danger of losing periodontal attachment was raised. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of hyaluronic acid treatment on induced periodontitis in rats exposed to gamma radiation radiographically and histopathologically. A total number of 30 adult male Albino rats were divided randomly into five groups (n = 6). Group 1 (C): received neither irradiation nor treatment. Group 2 (P): was subjected to induced periodontitis. Group 3 (PT): subjected to induced periodontitis with hyaluronic acid treatment. Group 4 (RP): received a single dose of total cranium irradiation 20 Gy with induced periodontitis. Group 5 (RPT): received a single dose of total cranium irradiation 20 Gy with induced periodontitis and hyaluronic acid treatment. All animals were euthanized, and the outcomes of treatment were evaluated radiographically by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and histopathologically. Results: Comparison of the five groups about bone density by one-way ANOVA showed a significant difference among groups (P < 0.001). The highest bone density values were measured in Group (PT) (1245 ± 22.86), while the lowest bone density values were measured in Group (RP) (926 ± 31.47). Using post hoc analysis for pairwise comparisons showed that Group (PT) and Group (RPT) have significantly higher values than Group (P) and Group (RP) (P < 0.001). Histologically, the group (RPT) shows a new formation of irregular connective tissue fibers of the periodontal ligament (PDL) with an area of distortion, fibrous marrow spaces with wide osteocyte lacunae without nuclei, and Haversian canals with empty blood vessels. The radiographic and histopathological findings of using HA as a topical application in rats subjected to induced periodontitis and exposed to gamma radiation revealed enhanced healing ability of the periodontal tissue with restoration of the bone density. Depending on these results, HA could be used as an adjunct local delivery agent for periodontal-affected patients receiving radiotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Integrating photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) shows promising potential in tumor treatment. Nevertheless, the lack of specific tumor targeting, serious photobleaching, and poor photothermal effect of photosensitizers, the intracellular low Fenton reaction efficiency, and glutathione (GSH)-elicited reactive oxygen species (ROS) depletion profoundly restrict ROS-mediated cancer therapy. To enhance ROS generation with the assistance of photothermal therapy (PTT), the hyaluronic acid (HA)-decorated Fe-MIL-88B (MIL) nanocatalysts were fabricated for tumor-targeted delivery of photosensitizer IR820. The IR820@HA-coated MIL (IHM) nanocatalysts remarkably enhanced the photothermal conversion efficacy and singlet oxygen (1O2) production of IR820 and lowered IR820 photobleaching. The IHM nanocatalysts promoted the conversion of H2O2 into toxic ·OH upon thermo/acidity-enhanced Fe3+-mediated Fenton reaction and consumed GSH via Fe3+-elicited GSH oxidation. After being internalized by 4 T1 cancer cells via CD44-mediated endocytosis, the IHM nanocatalysts under irradiation of near-infrared (NIR) laser prominently produced hyperthermia and strong ROS storm, thereby causing apoptosis and ferroptosis via mitochondria damage and lipid peroxidation, and inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). Through HA-mediated tumor targeting, the IHM nanocatalysts effectively accumulated in 4 T1 tumor and inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis by PTT-enhanced PDT/CDT combined with ferroptosis and ICD-amplified antitumor immune response, showing great promise in future tumor treatment."

      "abstract": "Current antitumor monotherapies have many limitations, and developing novel synergistic anticancer strategies with low side effects and high antitumor efficiency remains a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a pH and GSH dual-responsive pillar[5]arene-based amorphous bimetallic metal-organic framework (DOX@Fe/CuP5H) for synergistic antitumor therapy involving ferroptosis, cuproptosis and apoptosis. The hydrazide-functionalized pillar[5]arene derivatives were coordinated with Cu2+ to form irregular nanoparticles, which were subsequently etched and surface-coordinated using Fe3+. Finally, doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded onto the structures, followed by surface decoration with hyaluronic acid (HA) to yield the multifunctional DOX@Fe/CuP5H. The porous structure and amorphous nature of Fe/CuP5, and the specific binding of HA to CD44 overexpressed in cancer cells endowed the DOX@Fe/CuP5H with a high drug-loading capacity and effective targeting ability, while simultaneously reducing its toxicity to normal cells. DOX@Fe/CuP5H can dissociate in the tumor microenvironment, rapidly releasing DOX to induce apoptosis. Excess Fe3+ and Cu2+ deplete intracellular GSH, leading to a redox imbalance. The accumulation of Fe2+ further promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxide (LPO), triggering ferroptosis. Additionally, FDX1 regulates cellular protein lipoylation, while Cu+ binds to lipoylated proteins, causing acute proteotoxic stress and inducing cellular cuproptosis. Therefore, the rationally designed pillar[5]arene-based amorphous bimetallic metal-organic framework provides a safe and high-performance platform for enhancing the efficacy of multimodal synergistic anticancer therapies."

      "abstract": "The physical and chemical properties of gold nanoparticles can significantly influence their anti-tumor efficacy. Streamlining synthesis methods to modulate these properties and enhance therapeutic effects could facilitate their translation into clinical applications. This study presents a new approach to synthesize small alkynyl-modified gold nanoparticles (Alk-GNP) at room temperature using sodium citrate and propiolic acid (PA) to reduce chloroauric acid. The resulting Alk-GNP, approximately 11 nm in size with narrow dispersion, contrasts with larger gold nanoparticles (GNP) synthesized by the classical Turkevich method using boiling water. Subsequently, a round composite (CHAM) was developed using chitosan and hyaluronic acid to co-deliver Alk-GNP and the photosensitizer methylene blue for synergistic treatment. CHAM showed excellent stability and strong CD44-positive tumor targeting capabilities. It significantly boosted photothermal activity and reactive oxygen species generation compared to current GNP-based formulations. In tumor-bearing mouse models, CHAM effectively localized in tumor tissue and exhibited potent photothermal and photodynamic therapeutic effects to inhibit tumor growth while ensuring safety. The robust data presented in this study supports the potential translation of this approach, offering a simplified preparation process and improved tumor treatment efficacy."

While topical hyaluronic acid (HA) and corticosteroids show therapeutic potential, conventional formulations often suffer from rapid drug release. This study developed a pH-responsive HA hydrogel (HA@F127-MF) loaded with mometasone furoate (MF) to address these limitations. Oxidized HA (OHA) and aminated HA (HA-ADH) were synthesized and verified via FTIR and ¹H NMR. The hydrogel demonstrated exceptional swelling capacity, achieving ∼1500% equilibrium swelling ratio in PBS within 8 hours. Rheological tests revealed rapid gelation, self-healing properties, and favorable viscoelasticity, while SEM confirmed its stable 3D microporous structure. Sustained MF release (79.4% over 14 days) was achieved with pH-dependent kinetics. In vitro cytotoxicity assays using human nasal epithelial cells (HNEPCs) indicated excellent biocompatibility. APTT and PT tests suggested enhanced hemostatic effects via the intrinsic coagulation pathway. These findings position HA@F127-MF hydrogel as a promising dual-functional platform for CRS postoperative care, combining sustained anti-inflammatory drug delivery with hemorrhage control. However, further in vivo validation and clinical trials are warranted to confirm its efficacy and safety for translational applications. This dynamic drug-release hydrogel design may enhance clinical outcomes by concurrently addressing postoperative bleeding and chronic inflammation."

METHODS: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) documenting complications following PRP injections for foot and ankle pathologies. Condition studied, demographics, and complications were extracted. Complication rates and number needed to harm (NNH) were calculated, and random-effects models were generated to compare complications using odds ratios, with a p-value < 0.05 indicating significance. RESULTS: Sixteen studies assessing Achilles tendon injuries, plantar fasciitis, ankle osteoarthritis, and osteochondral lesions of the talus were identified, with 674 patients receiving PRP, and 749 patients received alternatives (corticosteroids, saline, dry needling, hyaluronic acid, prolotherapy, and stromal vascular fraction). Twelve studies reported no complications. Four studies reported 277 (rate of 41.1%) complications in the PRP group and 249 (rate of 33.7%) in the comparison group (p < 0.01). Treatment site pain was the most common complication, occurring at a significantly higher rate in the PRP group (14.5% vs. 10.1%, respectively, p < 0.01), and meta-data showing higher odds of pain following PRP (OR 2.23 I2 = 0.0%, p <0.01). The NNH for PRP was 13. One patient receiving PRP injections for Achilles tendinopathy experienced severe pain that resolved with surgical debridement. No other serious complications or infections occurred. CONCLUSION: PRP injections of the foot and ankle have significantly higher rates of post-injection pain versus comparison treatments, and an estimated 13 patients need to receive PRP injections to experience any complication over an alternative injection. Only one patient experienced an event that necessitated surgical intervention. Future studies investigating PRP should aim to report complications to allow clinicians to appropriately counsel patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, Systematic Review of RCTs."

On the other hand, external factors such as UV exposure cause damage to DNA, resulting in skin problems such as spots and sagging. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is involved in many biological processes, including collagen metabolism, wound healing, and skin barrier function. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 2 kDa HA oligosaccharides (HA2k) on skin spots and sagging. METHODS: In the human study, the effects of a HA2k lotion on spots and sagging were evaluated after 4 weeks of application to the skin. In vitro, the effects of HA2k on inflammatory cytokines, autophagy, and turnover of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were evaluated under two different stimulation conditions: injury with hydrogen peroxide or UVB. RESULTS: In the human study, HA2k treatment reduced facial spots and sagging skin after 4 weeks compared to an untreated group. The percentage reduction from baseline after 4 weeks was also higher in the HA2k-treated group. In vitro, HA2k inhibited hydrogen peroxide-induced NHEK inflammation. Furthermore, HA2k inhibited UVB-induced NHEK damage and promoted LC3-II production. In unstimulated NHEK, HA2k promoted involucrin production. CONCLUSION: HA2k reduced facial spots and sagging. The effect is thought to be due to the promotion of autophagy and keratinocyte turnover. HA2k application is expected to improve skin condition."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of intra-articular orthobiologics in hip osteoarthritis (HOA) has been presented as a therapeutic option and to postpone arthroplasty. There is little scientific evidence on the clinical application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) associated with hyaluronic acid as dual therapy. Thus, the aim of our systematic review is to compare the clinical improvement with the use of PRP with versus without hyaluronic acid (HA) in hip osteoarthritis. METHODS: We systematically searched Cochrane, PubMed, and Embase databases for studies evaluating patients with HOA who received PRP with vs. without HA. Pain and functional score were collected and pooled at 3-, 6-, and 12-months follow-up. Mean differences (MD) and 95% intervals were calculated, and heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. All statistical analysis was performed using R with the meta package. RESULTS: We included 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 cohort study, comprising 190 patients, of whom 88 received the PRP plus HA. Relative to PRP alone, dual therapy led to significantly higher pain scores at 3 months (SMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.64; p < 0.01; I2 = 0%) and at 12 months (MD 11.92 points; 95% CI 3.87 to 19.97; p < 0.01; I2 = 0%), translating into worsening of pain including HA. There was no difference between groups at any follow-up regarding functional score or pain at 6 months. CONCLUSION: Joint infiltration in HOA with PRP combined to HA showed higher perception of pain scores. Our findings suggest that the addition of HA in PRP treatment does not bring significant improvement and worsens patients' quality of life. However, more randomized trials with larger populations may increase robustness. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: identifier, CRD42024581335."

      "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a widely available, bio-compatible, polysaccharide with unique physical and chemical properties, which have inspired its application in many fields. Firstly, HA is a significant representative in wound healing, embryonic development, repair as well as regeneration. Secondly, HA exhibits pregnant meaning in cancer progression. Tumor cell proliferation, invasiveness, and motility can be modulated by the accumulation of HA in tumor stoma. Thirdly, HA is an actor in regulation processes during the angiogenesis. The level of HA, even low-molecular-weight HA, is considered to be a biomarker of tumor malignancy. Within this work, an intense overview of its application and the use of HA in drug delivery systems is given.HA plays a crucial role in many cases, such as cell signaling, morphogenesis, matrix organization, tissue regeneration, and pathobiology. Biocompatibility, mucoadhesivity, hygroscopicity, biodegradability, and viscoelasticity are to mention as physico-chemical properties of hyaluronan. This is why exogenous HA is investigated for drug delivery systems and exhibits a representative therapy of cancer, esthetic medicine, rhinology, arthrology, and cosmetics.In the end, the proof of concept presented by clinical trials is convincing to further investigate native HA as well as modified one for therapeutic delivery purposes."

However, maintaining the retention and stability of exosomes in vivo is a major challenge in clinical application of GENs. Here, we prepared hydrogels using modified hyaluronic acid (HA) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS). We investigated whether the combination of GENs with hydrogels could improve the stability of GENs and enhance their retention in tumor tissues, thereby enhancing their tumor therapeutic effect. In vitro experiments showed that hydrogels significantly increased the uptake of GENs by cells and increased tumor apoptosis rate. In vivo experiments showed that hydrogels significantly increased the retention of GENs in tumor tissues and improved the antitumor ability of GENs. Meanwhile, we evaluated the anti-tumor mechanism of GENs. The results showed that GENs and GENs@Hydrogels induced 4T1 cell apoptosis through the PTEN/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and caspase-dependent pathway. In addition, GENs and GENs@Hydrogels down-regulate PD-L1 level in tumor tissues, up-regulate MHC-I level, and increase the abundance of CD8+T cells, which have immune regulation ability. In conclusion, GENs@Hydrogels has been shown to be a successful candidate for the treatment of breast cancer (BC) with its promising potential to modulate immunity and inhibit tumor progression."

The purpose of the study was the evaluation of the clinical safety and efficacy of a high and low molecular weight HA hybrid complex injection for skin rejuvenation. METHOD: In this single-arm, before-and-after clinical study, 20 subjects with wrinkled, dry, or rough skin were enrolled. They received two treatment sessions, each of 2 mL of stabilized high- and low-molecular-weight HA through intradermal injections in five bioaesthetic points with an interval of 4 weeks. Efficacy assessment measures included biophysical and sonographic parameters and the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) score. Pain assessment, safety profile, and subject satisfaction were also reported. RESULTS: A significant improvement in skin firmness was demonstrated in both follow-up visits. The Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and the dermis ecodensity improved significantly in the first follow-up visit. A statistically significant increase in the dermis thickness was seen in the second follow-up visit. The median GAIS score indicated an average improvement of 51%-75%. The median overall satisfaction score was 7 and 6 in the first and second follow-up visits. No important side effects were observed. The average pain VAS score was 2 out of 10. CONCLUSION: This new HA-based formulation is a safe and efficient treatment option to restore the vitality and turgidity of the skin.

METHODOLOGY: The patients in the control group received clinical treatment with entecavir monotherapy, while those in the observation group underwent thymalfasin + entecavir combination therapy. The clinical curative effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors at different concentrations on diseases were compared from all aspects. RESULTS: There were lower levels of total bilirubin (TBIL) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in the observation group, a more satisfactory improvement in immune function-related indicators, and lower levels of HA, LN, and IVC in the observation group, which were statistically different between the two groups (P<0.05). The levels of liver function indicators, immune function-related indicators (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+, CD4+/CD8+), and HA, LN and IVC were not statistically different between the two groups before treatment. CONCLUSION: Entecavir is highly effective in the clinical treatment of HBeAG-positive chronic hepatitis B. However, entecavir + thymalfasin combination therapy can alleviate the clinical symptoms. In this way, liver fibrosis can be prevented in patients with HBeAG-positive chronic hepatitis B, and the clinical curative effect can be enhanced.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Silymarin is a natural flavonoid component isolated from the Silybum Marianum (Milk Thistle) plant with multiple pharmacological activities. We investigated its anti-fibrotic effect on the liver and demonstrated its role in activating hepatic progenitor stem cells during liver regeneration. METHODS: Hybrid polymeric protein nanoparticles were prepared by loading silymarin with an albumin-hyaluronic acid complex to achieve stem cell targeting and increase silymarin's bioavailability. RESULTS: TEM, Zeta potential, DLS, UV-visible spectrophotometer, Fluorescence analysis, and FTIR verified the successful formation of nanoparticles and efficient encapsulation. In the present study, The liver fibrotic model was induced by the intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride, followed by the injection of silymarin NPs into mice twice a week for 4 weeks. We evaluated the expression of hepatic fibrosis markers such as (Collagen I, TGF-β1, SMAD3, and MMP-3) and hepatic progenitor stem cell activation markers such as (HNF1β, FOXl1, CD90, Vimentin, and CD105). The results showed that the targeted silymarin NPs caused significant suppression and downregulation of Collagen I, TGF-β, SMAD-3, and MMP-3 and upregulation of the hepatic progenitor stem cells markers HNF1β, FOXl1, CD90, Vimentin, and CD105. They also didn't induce expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, proving that they cause no signs of inflammation. CONCLUSION: The novel point is that these results demonstrated that the targeted Silymarin NPs not only could efficiently alleviate CCl4-induced liver fibrosis more than using only free silymarin; by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad-3 signaling pathway, but also could activate hepatic progenitor stem cells causing liver regeneration."

Literature on long-term volumetric results and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is limited. This prospective study aims to precisely define and measure objective tissue metrics and PROs of HA fillers in different facial regions over 12 weeks. METHODS: Females aged 40 to 65 received injections in facial regions using HA fillers: Restylane-L® in nasolabial folds and marionette lines, Restylane-L Lyft® in the malars, and Restylane Silk® in the lip border. Patients completed FACE-Q® questionnaires, were photographed with 3D Vectra® M3 Imaging Software pre-injection, immediately post-injection, and at 2-, 4-, and 12-weeks post-injection. Volumes were analyzed from eight regions: left, right malars and extended midface (MEM), upper perioral (UP), lower perioral and jawline (LPJ), and lips. Tissue displacement factor (TDF) and effective volume (EV) were calculated. Statistical analyses included Mann Whitney U tests and risk-adjusted linear regression. RESULTS: 101 women participated. Restylane-L Lyft® had the highest TDF, 1.25, followed by Restylane-L®, 1.14, and Restylane Silk®, 0.56. EV for Restylane-L Lyft® was highest, 89.8%, followed by Restylane-L®, 89.7%, and Restylane Silk®, 70%. Volume maintenance was 65.5% (whole face), 79.2% (MEM), 62.7% (UP), and 37.2% (lips) over 12 weeks. PROs demonstrated improvements in facial appearance, treated regions, psychological and social function. CONCLUSIONS: We define the novel tissue metrics, TDF and EV, relative to HA treatments, with greatest volume maintenance in the midface and greatest loss around the mimetic areas throughout 12 weeks. Significantly improved PROs were observed for patients undergoing large volume HA filler injections."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop a stable polyethyleneimine/gold nanorod composite conjugated with a carbon quantum dot (CQD) and hyaluronic acid (HA) complex (CQD-HA-PEI@GNRs) for applications in chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. GNRs were synthesized using a seed-mediated growth method, and the amount of seed solution was optimized to obtain GNRs with an optimal aspect ratio and a strong peak in the near-infrared (NIR) region. The surface of the GNRs was then modified with polyethylene imine (PEI). In parallel, CQDs were synthesized through a hydrothermal method and subsequently conjugated with HA to act as an active targeting ligand. The resulting CQD-HA complex was loaded onto the surface of the PEI@GNR composite. Finally, the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was effectively loaded onto this innovative complex. The cytotoxicity of the final complex was evaluated on different cell lines in the presence and absence of laser irradiation. Furthermore, the efficacy of the formulation was investigated in BALB/c mice bearing breast cancer tumors. Characterization results confirmed the successful formation of GNRs with a length of 40 nm, exhibiting a strong peak at 813 nm in the NIR region. The zeta potential value of the GNRs was -25.62 mV, which increased to +40.59 mV after the surface modification with PEI. CQDs were synthesized and successfully conjugated with HA. DOX encapsulation efficiency was 92.8%, with appropriate drug release profiles in the presence of laser irradiation. The final complex showed appropriate cytotoxicity toward 4T1 and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. In vivo analysis of the CQD-HA-PEI@GNR-DOX complex combined with laser treatment demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition in comparison to the control group. Finally, this novel complex was proposed as an alternative for breast cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "As a notoriously incurable tumor, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits significant sensitivity to ferroptosis and the glutathione (GSH) antioxidant defense system plays a crucial role in its progression. Herein, we report a bimetallic chitosan/hyaluronic acid nanoparticle (5FCN, with a Fe/Cu mass ratio of 5:5) that employs a self-amplified dual mechanism of ferroptosis and cuproptosis for TNBC therapy. Hyaluronic acid in 5FCN specifically binds to the overexpressed CD44 receptor on TNBC cells. This allows 5FCN to enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, then release metal ions in acidic environments. Released Fe3+ and Cu2+ react with GSH in tumor cells, weakening the antioxidant system and producing Fe2+ and Cu+. These ions trigger Fenton/Fenton-like reactions with H2O2, generating toxic hydroxyl radicals (·OH) to boost ferroptosis. Meanwhile, high-valent Cu2+ and Fe3+ are produced, forming a cycle for GSH depletion and ·OH generation. As H2O2 depletes, the rising Cu+ level in cells causes lipoylated protein aggregation, amplifying cuproptosis. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that 5FCN exhibited superior cell-killing efficacy against TNBC with few side effects. Collectively, 5FCN represents a potential drug to self-amplify ferroptosis/cuproptosis in TNBC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Low back pain (LBP) associated with degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a serious condition resulting in significant morbidity, disability, and reduced quality of life for millions of people each year. Patients who fail to improve with conservative/non-invasive treatments including physical therapy and non-opioid analgesic medications have limited options, which include opioid analgesics with their associated significant risks; epidural steroid injections with limited supporting evidence; or surgical interventions such as spine fusion or artificial disc replacement. A safe, minimally invasive, non-opioid treatment that provides prolonged improvement in pain, function, and quality of life is needed for such patients. PURPOSE: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single injection of mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) with or without hyaluronic acid (HA) compared to an intradiscal saline injection through 36 months follow-up in subjects with chronic low back pain (CLBP) associated with moderate DDD (mDDD). STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, concurrent-controlled study conducted at 49 clinical sites. SUBJECT SAMPLE: A total of 404 subjects with CLBP associated with mDDD at one level from L1 to S1 received MPCs without HA (MPC), MPCs with HA (MPC+HA), or saline control (control) treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects were clinically and radiographically evaluated at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months post-injection. Clinical evaluation included adverse events, neurologic evaluation, laboratory tests, LBP intensity measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and EQ-5D-5L Index. Radiographic assessments used Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging and X-ray imaging studies. METHODS: The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite responder analysis for overall treatment success at both 12 and 24 months that was comprised of:[1] at least a 50% reduction from baseline in low back pain VAS score (average pain over 24 hours);[2] at least a 15-point decrease from baseline in ODI score; and[3] no adjudicated post-treatment interventions at the treated level. To assess superiority, a Bayesian analysis used a probability threshold of 0.9875. Additional analyses were performed on a pre-specified subpopulation of subjects with CLBP duration at baseline less than the median baseline duration of 68 months (CLBPLTM). Statistical assessments included least squares (LS) mean, LS mean change from baseline (CFB) using the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) and categorical responder analyses using stratified Cochran Mantel Haenszel row means score test with p<0.05 defined as statistically significant. This study was conducted under a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) application sponsored and funded by Mesoblast. RESULTS: All treatment groups showed substantial improvement from baseline in LS Mean LBP and ODI. The primary efficacy endpoint for the trial did not reach significance for either treatment group compared to control in all subjects. Furthermore, none of the secondary endpoints showed a significant difference between treatment and control in all subjects. While the primary and secondary responder efficacy endpoints were not reached, MPC+HA significantly reduced LS mean LBP compared to control at 12 and 24 months in all subjects. The results observed in all subjects were enhanced for MPC+HA and MPC in the pre-specified CLBPLTM subgroup with MPC+HA having significantly greater reduction in LBP at all time points compared to control and MPC having significantly greater reduction in LBP at 6, 12 and 36 months. In the CLBPLTM subgroup, MPC+HA also showed significantly greater proportion of pain responders at 12, 24 and 36 compared to control. MPC+HA also showed significantly greater function improvement at 12 and 18 months compared to control in the CLBPLTM subgroup. Furthermore, MPC+HA subjects in the CLBPLTM subgroup showed significantly greater improvement in quality of life (QOL) compared to control at 12, 24 and 36 months. MPC+HA baseline opioid users had greater reduction in daily average morphine equivalent dose (MED) compared to control at 6 through 36 months. Furthermore, significantly more MPC+HA baseline opioid users (27.8%) were not taking opioids at 36 months compared to (7.8%) control. The injection procedure and MPC treatment were well tolerated with no appreciable differences in Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs). No Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were related to the treatment or procedure. The number of subjects that received post-treatment interventions (PTI) at the treated level were comparable among groups. CONCLUSIONS: While the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were not met in all subjects, MPC+HA treatment showed a significant reduction in pain compared to control that was enhanced in subjects with CLBP duration less than 68 months. Intra-discal injection of MPC+HA is a minimally invasive non-opioid therapy that appears to be safe and demonstrates reduction in pain through 24 months compared to control with enhanced results in subjects with mDDD that have had CLBP less than 68 months."

To overcome these issues, a novel transdermal drug delivery system was developed, integrating microneedles (MNs) with biofilm-penetrating capability, the wound-healing properties of hyaluronic acid (HA), the antibacterial effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and the glucose-lowering action of insulin (Ins). Named HAMNs@AgNPs-Ins, this system demonstrated optimal morphological characteristics, robust mechanical strength, and 100 % skin penetration efficiency. It exhibited sustained antibacterial activity in vitro, ensured skin safety, and provided controlled, steady blood glucose reductions, achieving a 72.29 % reduction at 8 h, compared to the sharp decline seen with subcutaneous injection. Additionally, wound healing experiments showed a significant improvement in the healing rate of 89.66 ± 1.34 % in the HAMNs@AgNPs-Ins group, compared to 48.19 ± 9.03 % in the control group. These results underscore the potential of HAMNs@AgNPs-Ins as an effective treatment for DM-associated wounds."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advances in systemic targeted therapies, topical agents remain the primary treatment for localized psoriasis. However, their therapeutic effects are often delayed and unsatisfactory. The dissolving microneedle (DMN) patch, a novel transdermal drug delivery system, enhances the absorption of topical agents through micro-channels. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of DMN patches in enhancing drug delivery and improving clinical outcomes in psoriatic plaques. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, split-body study was conducted to verify the efficacy of additional use of DMN patches after topical agent application in psoriasis treatment. Patients with mild psoriasis were enrolled and 6 paired lesions per patient were randomized into 3 groups: ointment-only, ointment-with-no needle patch, and ointment-with-DMN patch. Lesions were treated with a topical agent (betamethasone and calcipotriol) once daily for 2 weeks. Modified psoriasis area and severity index (mPASI) scores were measured weekly. In vitro and ex vivo experiments were performed to confirm micro-channel formation, microneedle dissolution, and drug penetration enhancement. RESULTS: A total of 132 paired lesions from 22 patients were analyzed. The ointment-with-DMN patch group showed significantly improved mPASI scores (80.4%±20.5%; 5.42→1.06) compared to the ointment-with-no needle patch (64.6%±33.0%; 4.94→1.68) (p<0.05) and ointment-only groups (55.5%±31.4%; 5.00→2.15) (p<0.001). In vitro studies demonstrated 2.1-fold enhanced drug delivery with DMN patches, while ex vivo histological analysis confirmed micro-channel formation. No adverse events, including infection or psoriasis exacerbation, were observed. CONCLUSION: The DMN patch is an effective adjunctive tool that enhances transdermal drug delivery and improves therapeutic outcomes in psoriatic plaques, particularly those refractory to topical agents.

Intra-articular injection for local drug delivery in the joint cavity enhances drug retention duration for OA treatment. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to attenuate OA by thoroughly modulating the joint microenvironment, achieving controlled drug release, and enhancing lubrication. This study develops hyaluronic acid (HA) composite hydrogels, infused with gelatin microspheres containing a drug, utilizing dynamic interactions between phenylboronic acid and catechol to modulate the microenvironment by scavenging ROS, facilitating controlled drug release, and improving lubrication to mitigate OA. The composite hydrogels can be injected by intra-articular injection due to the shear-thinning properties, demonstrating broad ROS scavenging capacity and matrix metalloproteinase-9 responsive drug release. Both the in vitro and in vivo experiments prove the protective efficacy of the composite hydrogels against the degradation of cartilage matrix. Additionally, the hydrogels can offer efficient lubrication and effectively attenuate OA. Thus, the injectable HA composite hydrogels demonstrated potential in the management of OA."

Women aged 21-65 with a history of rUTIs were randomized into three groups: fosfomycin, the dietary supplement, and a combination of both treatments. Primary outcome was frequency of rUTI episodes per month. RESULTS: Combination therapy demonstrated greatest reduction in rUTI episodes per month at 12 months compared to fosfomycin or supplement monotherapy (0.23 ± 0.37 vs 0.58 ± 0.67 and 1.12 ± 0.96 for fosfomycin and supplement monotherapy respectively; p < 0.05) and to supplement monotherapy at 6 months (0.69 ± 1.03 vs 1.43 ± 1.33; p < 0.05), with significant improvement of ICIQ-FLUTS domains compared to other groups at 12 months (p < 0.05). Combination therapy had lower number of women matching rUTI criteria (55.32% vs 76.47% and 84%; p < 0.05) and symptoms remission at 12 months (89.36% vs 56.86% and 20%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Combining fosfomycin and an integrated D-mannose supplement for managing rUTIs offers a potential reduction in antibiotic reliance. Further large-scale studies are recommended to confirm these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov identifier: NCT06659016)."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical indications, post-operative complications, and dosimetric impact of stabilized hyaluronic acid (sHA) spacer insertion in the retroperitoneum for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of retroperitoneal cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed two cases of SBRT for retroperitoneal lesions: a primary left renal cell carcinoma and an oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lesion in the right adrenal gland. In both cases, a sHA spacer was percutaneously inserted between the bowel and the lesion. The spacer was placed under laparoscopic and ultrasound guidance for the renal tumor, and under CT guidance for the adrenal lesion. The prescribed dose was 42 Gy in three fractions for the primary renal lesion and 40 Gy in five fractions for the adrenal lesion. Dosimetric parameters were evaluated in two planning scenarios: (1) without the spacer, adhering to OAR constraints, and (2) with the spacer. RESULTS: Spacer insertion for the primary left renal cancer significantly improved PTV D95% from 67.9 % to 99.5 % of the prescribed dose, a 46.5 % increase. PTV D99% increased from 54.5 % to 86.7 %, reflecting a 59.1 % improvement. The large bowel's maximum dose was reduced from 28.2 Gy to 24.4 Gy, and the volume receiving 24 Gy was minimal with the spacer (0.06 cc). For the right oligometastatic adrenal lesion, despite a fourfold increase in tumor volume, post-spacer dosimetry showed improved PTV coverage without exceeding OAR constraints. No post-operative complications were observed in either case. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on sHA spacer use in the retroperitoneum for SBRT. Spacer insertion near the large bowel significantly improves dosimetry, enabling higher doses to targets while keeping OAR doses within safe limits. Further research with a larger patient population is required to assess safety and for optimization of the technique for spacer placement in order to enhance clinical outcomes."

This case report presents a 58-year-old Chinese female who developed widespread joint pain after contracting mild COVID-19 and was subsequently diagnosed with RA. Her symptoms included joint swelling, pain, and abnormal serological markers. Initial treatment with methylprednisolone and tofacitinib was discontinued due to side effects, and she switched to a combined approach of herbal and Western medicine. After a year of treatment, her widespread pain and joint swelling largely resolved, leaving persistent localized pain in specific joints. To address this persistent localized pain, she received 35 kDa hyaluronan fragment (HA35) injections, resulting in significant improvement, including complete relief of elbow and knee pain and restored joint mobility. Continuous HA35 injections, followed by oral HA35 powder, also completely relieved her foot pain. This case highlights the effectiveness of HA35 in managing persistent RA pain, particularly for residual pain after conventional treatments, and suggests its potential as a therapeutic option."

However, the poor water solution and short absorption wavelengths of porphyrins limit their clinical application. In this work, a novel worm-like porphyrin covalent organic framework (Por-COF) with excellent dispersibility and near-infrared absorption was prepared via a facile method. First, a pH-responsive macromolecule was prepared using Schiff base bonds between porphyrin and terephthalaldehyde, and the spatial arrangement of macromolecules was controlled to prepare Por-COF. Second, the hypoxia-responsive drug tirapazamine (TPZ) and tumor-targeted hyaluronic acid (HA) were loaded to Por-COF through the electrostatic effect to prepare a multifunction nanomedicine (Por-COF@TPZ/HA) that could simultaneously produce abundant reactive oxygen species and high temperature via808 nm laser irradiation. TPZ was cascaded for the synergistic therapy of cancers. In vitro cytotoxicity showed that the inhibition rate of cell activity in the Por-COF@TPZ/HA + Laser group was 1.2 times higher than that in the Por-COF/HA + Laser group. In vivo experiments also demonstrated that the aggravated tumor hypoxia caused by photodynamic therapy could activate TPZ to achieve high-efficiency chemotherapy. Combined photodynamic-photothermal therapy and chemotherapy had an outstanding synergistic effect. This work provides a promising method for Por-COF preparation and a feasible strategy for the synergistic therapy of cancers."

However, there are no clear recommendations for its use in clinical situations not usually addressed in therapeutic guidelines. DESIGN: Members of the European Viscosupplementation Consensus Group (EUROVISCO), made up of rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons, and rehabilitation physicians from seven European countries, were asked to make a therapeutic decision on 30 clinical scenarios based on their clinical experience and data from the literature, using the Delphi method. For each scenario, the strength of agreement and the level of consensus were calculated by the chairman of the group. RESULTS: The expert panel reached consensus on 18 of the 30 clinical scenarios proposed. According to the experts, the factors that most influence the decision to use VS with HA to treat knee osteoarthritis are the nature and severity of symptoms, the presence of comorbidity, the absence of therapeutic alternatives, and the patient's refusal to undergo knee arthroplasty. Obesity and an advanced radiological degree of osteoarthritis have been identified as the two main factors for poor response to VS with HA and should be considered before any decision is made to viscosupplement. CONCLUSION: This set of recommendations, based on common clinical scenarios, is intended to help practitioners make decisions about HA VS in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee."

METHODS: Two authors independently reviewed databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in our meta-analysis. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores (WOMAC total, pain, stiffness, and physical function scores), visual analog scale (VAS) scores, EQ-VAS scores, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, and adverse events were used as outcome measurements to evaluate the efficacy of LP-PRP and HA treatment. RESULTS: After screening 377 potential articles, 12 RCTs were included in this systemic review and meta-analysis. The WOMAC total scores and WOMAC physical function scores of the LP-PRP group were better than those of the HA group at 6 and 12 months. VAS scores of the LP-PRP group were better than those of the HA group at 3, 6, and 12 months. The LP-PRP group showed a better outcome of IKDC scores than the HA group at 6 months. There was no significant difference in adverse events between the LP-PRP and HA groups. CONCLUSION: Intraarticular injections of LP-PRP showed better overall outcomes, such as WOMAC total scores, WOMAC physical function scores, VAS scores, and IKDC scores, compared with HA for adult patients with knee osteoarthritis at 6- and 12-month follow-up periods. Also, LP-PRP showed better pain relief compared with HA at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up periods. Intraarticular LP-PRP improves pain relief and overall outcomes in patients with knee osteoarthritis."

      "abstract": "Although combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy (PTT) holds significant promise for treating triple-negative breast cancer, the existing delivery systems for achieving synergistic antitumor activity remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we developed of dual-drug loaded hyaluronic acid (HA) nanodrugs, which exhibited pH, glutathione (GSH), and thermal triple-responsiveness and CD44-targeting capabilities for chemo-PTT synergistic therapy in breast cancer. Gemcitabine (GCB) and metformin (MET) were conjugated to HA via amide and disulfide bonds to form dual-drug loaded prodrugs (HSGM), which were then coated onto the surface of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs) to self-assemble into HSGM/PDA NPs. These NPs selectively accumulated at the tumor site through HA receptors and released GCB and MET in response to low pH and high GSH concentrations. The NPs demonstrated excellent photothermal performance, with heat generated from near-infrared (NIR)-laser irradiation accelerating drug release within tumor. Additionally, MET inhibited the production of heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70), mitigating thermotolerance induced by PTT, thereby enhancing the PTT effect. The combination of chemotherapy and PTT synergistically improved anti-tumor efficacy (tumor inhibition ratio: 99.11 %) while showing negligible systemic toxicity, effectively preventing tumor metastasis and recurrence. This integrated approach offers valuable insights for the clinical treatment of breast cancer and other malignant tumors."

In vitro results demonstrated that HA-DA hydrogel coating with an appropriate degree of dopamine grafting significantly improved the in vitro angiogenic activity of BCP scaffolds without affecting their osteogenic activity. The Mg-CS coating, heat-treated to ensure good combination with the BCP matrix, could sustainably release angiogenic silicon ions and osteogenic magnesium ions. Results from rat cranial defect repair showed that the implanted BCP@HA-DA-2 and BCP@10 Mg-CS scaffolds further accelerated the occurrence and development of neovascularization at the defect site, facilitating new bone formation. Among them, BCP@10 Mg-CS scaffold exhibited the best bone defect repair effect and has the potential for clinical application."

Arginine (Arg) and hyaluronic acid (HA) are crucial for maintaining ocular health because of their unique biological benefits. In this study, we investigated the cationic properties of arginine to develop dexamethasone-loaded HA nanoparticles (ADHA NPs) and evaluated their therapeutic potential in alleviating dry eye syndrome using various reported in-vitro and in-vivo techniques. The ionic cross-linking method was used to prepare ADHA NPs. The ADHA NPs exhibited nearly 94.99 ± 4.16% drug release at the end of 6 h and followed the Korsemeyar-Peppas kinetic model (R2 = 0.9811). Moreover, the developed formulation exhibited a higher water retention capacity, i.e., 86.89 ± 1.41%, and revealed enhanced mucoadhesion characteristics. ADHA NPs also exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects (p < 0.001) compared to dexamethasone in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell lines against proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 β, NO and TNF-α. Furthermore, cell line studies in HCECs (human corneal epithelial cells) showed cytocompatibility and a dose-dependent uptake of ADHA NPs. ADHA NPs also maintained the cell integrity against 0.005% benzalkonium chloride (BAC) induced dry eye model on HCECs. Further, the Schirmer tear test showed twofold enhanced tear production in the developed formulation, and ADHA NPs seem to maintain the uniform structure of the tear. In vivo, drug retention studies ensured the good retention properties of ADHA NPs up to 12 h. In conclusion, ADHA NPs, because of their anti-inflammatory, mucoadhesiveness, modified drug release capacity, and higher drug retention properties, could serve as a potential therapeutic alternative for treating dry eye conditions.",

      "abstract": "Multi-drug resistance (MDR) presents a major challenge in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Combining chemotherapy and gene therapy offers a promising strategy to improve drug sensitivity in resistant AML cells. However, designing an effective delivery system for co-administration of multiple agents while maintaining biosafety remains challenging. In this study, we developed a biocompatible co-delivery system that incorporates hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) small interfering RNA (siRNA). HCPT was loaded onto gold nanoparticles through crystallization, ensuring drug stability and safety. The branched configuration of self-branched chitosan contributed to improved gene delivery efficiency. The hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanocarrier specifically targeted CD44 receptors expressed on AML cells, while the pH-sensitive properties of self-branched chitosan promoted localized drug and gene release. This system effectively delivered the therapeutic agents to tumor sites, improving cellular uptake and synergistically inhibiting DNA synthesis by downregulating glycolysis and P-glycoprotein expression in leukemic cells. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated strong antitumor efficacy and excellent biosafety. This co-delivery system offers a promising strategy for overcoming drug resistance in AML and holds potential for clinical translation."

      "abstract": "Traumatic corneal injuries are a leading cause of blindness among military personnel. These injuries need immediate attention in the combat zone, but treatment options are limited as life-saving measures are often prioritized. To address this critical gap, we have developed OcuPairTM, a two-component hydrogel system that consists of i) an injectable viscoelastic filler that stabilizes the ocular cavity and prevents hypotony. ii) An in situ photo-curable adhesive hydrogel comprising of methacrylated, hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer and hyaluronic acid engineered to form a transparent, flexible, and robust bandage within 90 seconds, adhering to the corneal surface and ensuring a water-tight seal securing full-thickness corneal wounds. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that the adhesive hydrogel is mechanically robust and withstands intraocular pressures beyond physiological range. In a rabbit corneal injury model, OcuPairTM effectively sealed complex full-thickness wounds and preserved the eye with favorable clinical outcomes for 5 days with no toxicity over 30 days. In this study, we have validated the pilot scale synthesis, formulation optimization, GMP scale-up, and IDE-enabling GLP toxicity, essential for clinical translation as a battlefield-ready solution."

Glucose-responsive delivery systems envision an autonomous approach to improve insulin therapy. Here, a glucose-sensitive insulin delivery system comprising hyaluronic acid conjugated with a diboronate glucose binder as a carrier for diol-modified insulin is shown. This approach seeks improved precision in insulin delivery, leveraging bidentate glucose binding to achieve enhanced glucose affinity and specificity. Modification of insulin with a diol motif preserves its native conformation and function. These insulin formulations correct blood glucose in diabetic mice, including glucose-responsive function when subjected to a glucose challenge. However, the absence of secondary interactions, such as electrostatic complexation, ultimately limits the duration of function relative to that of previous platforms. Integrating complementary interactions alongside dynamic-covalent glucose binders therefore enhances the functional duration and therapeutic efficacy in the design of glucose-responsive polymeric carriers, offering design insights into the development of new carriers for glucose-responsive insulin delivery.",

Methods: Wound healing effects were assessed using HaCaT keratinocytes, while antimicrobial activity was evaluated against human skin pathogens using a microdilution assay. In vitro cytotoxicity tests ensured formulation safety, whereas in vivo wound healing was further investigated using an animal model. Gene expression analysis was performed to assess the molecular mechanisms involved. Results: The unique glucan composition of C. squamosus (15.38% α-glucans and 7.91% β-glucans) deviated from typical mushroom polysaccharide profiles, warranting further exploration of its bioactivity. In vitro mushroom polysaccharides promoted 25.35% wound closure after 24 hours, while the three-component formulation achieved 35.81% closure. Antibacterial activity showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.44-1.75 mg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBCs) of 0.88-3.50 mg/mL, while antifungal activity ranged from 0.22 to 0.44 mg/mL (MICs) and 0.44 to 0.88 mg/mL (minimum fungicidal concentration-MFC). In vivo data showed that 60% of treated wounds fully closed by day 11, despite no statistically significant difference from the control. However, gene expression analysis highlighted VEGF and collagen upregulation, indicating an enhancement of wound healing on a molecular level. Conclusions: The novel three-component formulation demonstrated consistent wound healing and antimicrobial properties, supporting its potential as a safe and effective treatment for chronic and acute wounds."

Materials and Methods: Twenty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Trichloroacetic acid was applied to the right uterine horns of all the groups to induce adhesion formation. First, we induced the Asherman model in two rats (Group 1). The remaining rats were divided into the following three groups: Group 2 received intrauterine hyaluronic acid treatment, Group 3 received oral methylprednisolone treatment, and Group 4 received both treatments. Inflammation, gland count, and fibrosis levels were assessed histopathologically. VEGF levels were analyzed immunohistochemically. Results: Hyaluronic acid treatment increased the uterine lumen diameter and vascularization. Methylprednisolone treatment increased the gland count and uterine wall thickness while decreasing the inflammation and fibrosis scores. Combined treatment provided a statistically significant advantage over single treatments. In particular, the combined treatment group exhibited significantly lower fibrosis (p = 0.184) and inflammation scores (p = 0.071), as well as higher gland counts (p = 0.849) and VEGF expression (p = 0.114), compared to the groups receiving only methylprednisolone or hyaluronic acid. These differences indicate that the synergistic effect of the two agents results in more effective endometrial healing than when either treatment is applied alone. Conclusions: Methylprednisolone treatment significantly prevented adhesion formation and reduced the inflammation and fibrosis scores compared to hyaluronic acid treatment alone. The combined treatment adds to the effects of the hyaluronic acid treatment alone and provides better healing.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is a leading cause of death globally, driven by late diagnoses, aggressive progression, and multidrug resistance (MDR). Advances in nanotechnology are tackling these challenges, paving the way for transformative cancer treatments. Hyaluronic acid (HA)-based nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as promising platforms due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and natural targeting capabilities via CD44 (cluster of differentiation 44) receptors. Functionalizing NPs with HA enhances cellular uptake through CD44, improves pharmacokinetics, tumor localization, and anticancer efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of HA-based NPs, highlighting their potential to address limitations in cancer treatment and inspire further innovation. The targeting efficiency of HA-based NPs can be further optimized by integrating passive (e.g., PEGylation), active (e.g., ligand conjugation), and stimuli-responsive mechanisms (e.g., pH, redox, light, enzyme activity, and temperature sensitivity). These NPs also enable therapeutic combinations, such as co-delivery of chemotherapeutics with gene therapies (e.g., siRNA) and integration of photothermal and photodynamic therapies, alongside immune checkpoint inhibitors, amplifying therapeutic synergy. Despite promising preclinical results, challenges such as scalability, stability, long-term safety, ethical and regulatory hurdles, and high costs persist. Nonetheless, HA-based NPs represent a cutting-edge approach, combining biocompatibility, precision targeting, and multimodal functionality to combat cancer effectively, while mitigating side effects."

      "abstract": "There is continuing interest in using biologics in root coverage procedures. The aim of the present study was to explore the 2-year outcomes following multiple gingival recessions (GRs) coverage using the application of cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA) in combination with modified coronally advanced tunnel (MCAT) together with subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG). Adopting a split-mouth design, 266 GRs were randomly allocated to either a test (MCAT + SCTG + HA) or control group (MCAT + SCTG). The main outcome variable was the stability of the obtained mean root coverage from 6 months to 24 months. Twenty-four patients were evaluated at the 2-year follow-up. Comparisons between test and control sides at the same time points were evaluated using the t-test for independent variables. The changes in time were compared by one-way analysis of variance with the Tukey post hoc test separately for the test and control groups. The study protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05045586). At 2 years, around ninety percent of recessions showed complete root coverage (87.02% of the test group and 91.90% of the control group). Mean root coverage did not differ between the two sides, with 81.37 ± 37.17% (test) and 84.63 ± 35.33% (control), respectively. Significant improvements in the reduction of gingival recession height, clinical attachment level gain, gingival thickness increase, and the root esthetic score were found in both groups after 2 years, but no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups. The adjunctive application of HA significantly improved soft tissue texture (STT, 0.94 ± 0.23 for the test group vs. 0.71 ± 0.46 for the control group). Treatment of multiple gingival recessions with MCAT + SCTG with or without HA yielded marked and comparable 2-year clinical outcomes, which could be maintained over a period of 24 months. The clinical relevance of the demonstrated significant difference in STT between groups may be minimal."

With the aging population and increasing social awareness, there is a surge in demand for treatment. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of a novel, less-rigidly crosslinked, 15 mg/mL resilient, high-stretch hyaluronic acid filler for improvement of radial cheek lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outcomes were assessed using photographs, the Allergan Fine Lines Scale, and Facial Appearance, Health Related Quality of Life and Adverse Effects - Questionnaire score Appraisal of Lines. Two treatments were performed, 4 to 6 weeks apart. Measurements were taken at baseline, at each follow-up treatment, and 4 weeks after the last treatment. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were enrolled. Allergan Fine Lines Scales showed significant improvement between baseline and 4 weeks after the first visit (3.4 ± 0.2, 3.2 ± 0.2, p = .049) and between baseline and 8 weeks after the first visit (3.4 ± 0.2 vs 2.35 ± 0.1, p < .01). Facial Appearance, Health Related Quality of Life and Adverse Effects - Questionnaire scores showed a significant improvement between the baseline and 4 weeks after the first visit (45.9 ± 3 vs 67.4 ± 4.2, p = .0004) and between baseline and 8 weeks after the first visit (45.9 ± 3 vs 62 ± 4.0, p = .0034). CONCLUSION: Treatment with a resilient hyaluronic acid seems to be effective in the appearance of fine lines of the cheek. This could potentially enhance patient self-assurance and improve quality of life by reducing the appearance of radial cheek lines and improve overall skin quality."

      "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injuries are common and a major source of pain that can lead to debilitating loss of function. Current treatments are limited, with autologous nerve grafts being the gold standard treatment for nerve injuries. However, autografting is not always successful and can lead to increased debilitation through donor site morbidity. Tissue engineering seeks to improve nerve injury treatment though the use of nerve conduits. Conduits made from a functional biomaterial can be implanted into a nerve injury site encouraging and controlling axonal regrowth without causing additional harm to the patient. Both silk fibroin (SF) and hyaluronic acid (HA) have been proven successful in the field of neural tissue engineering. SF has excellent mechanical properties and is biocompatible. HA is part of the extracellular matrix and had been used in nerve regeneration applications. This study developed aligned combination SF-HA nanofibers through electrospinning that could be used within a nerve conduit. Both materials were methacrylated to allow for photocrosslinking and additional control over material properties. Methcrylated SF-HA was tested alongside a material containing only methacrylated HA that has already proven to be effective in literature. When characterizing the materials, it was found that through chemical methacrylation HA was substituted at 60% while SF reported a 30% substitution. Electrospun SF-HA nanofibers were found to have a greater diameter than HA fibers; however, SF-HA was found to be more aligned with greater surface hydrophobicity. Mechanically, it was found that both materials exceeded the elastic modulus of native tissue, but SF-HA far exceeded HA in elasticity and overall fiber extension. Furthermore, human Schwann cells attached, proliferated, and released more pro-regenerative growth factors on SF-HA than HA. Dorsal root ganglia neurons also displayed longer neurite extensions on SF-HA fibers. We concluded that SF-HA nanofibers have potential as a nerve conduit material."

      "abstract": "To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of postoperative colorectal cancer treatment and prevent peritoneal metastasis, we propose a strategy utilizing the photothermal-induced ultra-efficient and long-lasting multi-stage immuno-chemo synergistic therapy. To implement this strategy, oxaliplatin (OXA), curcumin (Cur), and Mn2+ were coordinated to form infinite coordination polymer nanoparticles (OXA-Mn(II)-Cur ICP NPs). These nanoparticles are encapsulated with polydopamine (PDA) to create OXA-Mn(II)-Cur ICP@PDA NPs, which are subsequently embedded in a sprayable hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel. The resulting ICP@PDA NPs@composite hydrogel exhibits strong tissue adhesion and segmented pH-responsive drug release properties. Notably, the hydrogel can sustainably release drugs for over 20 days in vivo, maximizing local drug concentration while minimizing systemic toxic side effects. Each component of the composite hydrogel serves multiple functions, and its application to postoperative tumor sites enables long-term, dual-pathway, multi-stage immune activation. This immune response synergizes with chemotherapy to achieve a highly effective therapeutic outcome. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the composite hydrogel effectively eliminates residual tumors, ensuring a 100% survival rate without recurrence for 80 days in treated mice. Furthermore, it inhibits peritoneal metastasis and completely eradicates intraperitoneal tumors within 20 days. The ICP@PDA NPs@composite hydrogel represents a promising therapeutic platform for postoperative colorectal cancer treatment and metastasis prevention."

      "abstract": "Nano drug delivery systems are a promising candidate for cancer treatment. However, its practical application is largely hindered by uncontrollable co-assembly, single function, low drug loading and lack of targeting ability. In this paper, the hyaluronic acid (HA) functionalized hydroxycamptothecine (HCPT) and photosensitizer TCPP (HA@H-T) carrier-free nanoparticles (NPs) are precisely prepared to obtain ultrafine nanostructure. The co-assembly process is explored with different microfluidic processes, NMR, FTIR and fluorescence quenching experiments. A possible two-step co-assembly mechanism is proposed to control the nucleation and growth process of HA@H-T. The HA is used as a structure-directing agent to manipulate the co-assembly at the liquid-solid interface between H-T NPs and HA solution. The confined interfacial co-assembly of HA would induce the heterogeneous growth to form the NPs with ultrafine particle size (76.6 ± 0.4 nm) and small PDI (0.15 ± 0.01). The HA@H-T exhibits enhanced tumor suppressive ability when tested with 4T1, A549 and HCT116 cells. HA@H-T has a high cellular uptake rate (87.4 %) and high ROS production levels (90.5 %). When exposed to near-infrared irradiation, the enhanced combined chemo/photodynamic therapy of HA@H-T is obtained in vivo animal experiments. This work paves a new avenue for the preparation of carrier-free NPs by microfluidic controllable co-assembly for chemo/photodynamic therapy."

The eyes were then divided into four groups for subsequent analysis: Trehalose + HA (Group T, n = 6); dexpanthenol + HA (Group P, n = 6); coenzyme Q10+vitamin E + HA (Group V, n = 6); and one control group (CG, n = 4). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the size of the epithelial defect area between the groups on days 1, 3, and 5. However, a marked difference in the healing of epithelial defects was observed. Histologic analysis revealed optimal healing in terms of stromal edema, epithelial disruption, and lymphatic infiltration in group P. Alpha SMA (alpha smooth actin)-positive areas was higher in groups P and V. Electron microscopic examination revealed enhanced anterior surface epithelial formation and collagen arrangement in the treatment groups compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study are consistent with those of other studies in the literature, which have shown the superiority of trehalose, dexpanthenol, and coenzyme Q10 to the control group. Furthermore, histologic and immunohistochemical evaluations revealed that the P and V groups exhibited superior healing signs in comparison to the T group. Notably, our study is the first to comparatively analyze artificial tears with trehalose, dexpanthenol, and coenzyme Q10 in terms of epithelial defect healing, incorporating electron microscopic examination."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This prospective, triple blind randomized clinical trial aims to specifically evaluate the effect of Aluneb® (hyaluronic acid plus xilitol) in the postoperative treatment of inferior turbinate radiofrequency in adults compared to nebulized isotonic saline. METHODS: Adults undergoing radiofrequency turbinate ablation were included. Treatment group received Aluneb® (hyaluronic acid plus xylitol) while the control group received nebulized isotonic saline for two months after treatment. Participants were studied the week before surgery (visit 0), and at 7, 15, 30 and 60 days after surgery. At all visits, participants underwent physical examination, rhinomanometry, SNOT-22, and visual analogue scale (VAS) of symptoms. RESULTS: 34 participants were recruited. Crusts (endoscopy) were less in the Aluneb® hyaluronic acid plus xylitol group. Nasal crusting, epistaxis and nasal obstruction VAS were statistically significant lower. VAS for Rhinorrea, halitosis, cacosmia and pain and nasal resistance obtained lower self-reported values in the hyaluronic acid plus xilitol group, but these differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Hyaluronic acid plus xilitol demonstrated promise in improving postoperative outcomes, future studies with larger sample sizes and different surgical techniques are encouraged."

      "abstract": "Recently, with the increasing number of injections in the lying ear, various complications have emerged. We present a case report of vestibular dysfunction in a 39-year-old woman following hyaluronic acid injection into the ear, a relatively uncommon complication associated with this procedure. The patient exhibited symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, tongue hemiplegia, nystagmus, and gait instability immediately after the injection at the cranioauricular sulcus. Prompt administration of hyaluronidase into the sulcus anthelicis transversus and cranioauricular sulcus did not alleviate the symptoms. Subsequently, the patient required hospital admission in a wheelchair the following day. After a thorough examination and consultations with neurology and otolaryngology specialists, the patient was diagnosed with acute unilateral vestibular disease. Subsequent to comprehensive treatment focused on vestibular decompression, the patient experienced significant alleviation of symptoms and regained the ability to walk independently. The underlying mechanism of the lesion involved the accumulation of a substantial amount of hyaluronic acid in the mastoid region via the facial nerve canal, leading to its entry into the inner ear due to gravitational and pressure forces, causing vestibular dysfunction and symptoms such as vertigo, nausea, and walking instability. Understanding the anatomy in the injection area is helpful to diagnose and manage the related complications.

In the term of mechanism, circCDR1 could sponge miR-890 to regulate GJB6. The inhibition of circCDR1 on glioma progression could be reversed by miR-890, and the suppressive effect of miR-890 inhibitor on glioma progression also could be overturned by GJB6 silencing. CNPs could introduce TMZ and circCDR1 into glioma cells. The inhibitory effects of CNPs on glioma cell progression and tumor growth were much better than TMZ, TNPs and CNPs. Our study showed that circCDR1 could regulate the miR-890/GJB6 axis to inhibit glioma progression, and the constructed CNPs had a good inhibitory effect on glioma progression.",

      "abstract": "This research delves into the advancements in chronic skin wound treatment, with a particular focus on diabetic foot ulcers, utilizing hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels. Hyaluronic acid, an integral component of the skin's extracellular matrix, plays a crucial role in process such as inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue regeneration. Due to their three-dimensional network structure, biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and gas exchange capabilities, HA-based hydrogels are considered highly suitable for promoting wound healing. Nonetheless, pure HA hydrogels exhibit limitations including insufficient mechanical strength and rapid release of encapsulated substances. To address these limitations, the incorporation of bioactive materials such as chitosan and collagen was investigated. This combination not only optimized mechanical strength and degradation rates but also enhanced antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, responsive hydrogel dressings were developed to adapt to the specific characteristics of the diabetic wound microenvironment, enabling on-demand drug release. These advancements present new perspectives for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The knee is the most commonly afflicted joint in osteoarthritis (OA). Injection of intra-articular of hyaluronic acid (IAHA) is a frequently used therapy for the management of knee OA with varying product characteristics. PURPOSE: To describe and characterize the mechanism of action (MoA) of IAHA products concerning nociception, chondroprotection, and anti-inflammatory properties via a targeted literature review. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: We followed the standard methodologies for conducting and reporting targeted reviews as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, adapted for conducting a targeted literature review. Relevant studies were identified by searching the Embase database using predefined search strategies via the Ovid platform. The results of the review were reported according to the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). RESULTS: A total of 182 studies were included in this targeted literature review. Of these, 107 reported chondroprotective action, 59 anti-inflammatory activity, 18 analgesic properties, 30 proteoglycan or glycosaminoglycan synthesis, 8 subchondral bone effects, 2 mechanical effects, and 1 other effects of IAHA. These MoAs were studied through diverse types of studies: in vitro biochemistry, animal physiological studies, or human physiological and clinical studies. The chondroprotective effect was the most studied MoA and showed an increase in anabolic biomarkers, such as collagen types II, IX, and XI, and a reduction in catabolic biomarkers, such as matrix metalloproteinases, which play a primary role in the downstream signaling pathways in OA and cartilage degradation in the synovial fluid. IAHA was widely reported by studies to reduce soluble inflammatory mediators, such as interleukins 1β and 6 and tumor necrosis factor α, thereby decreasing the production of degradative enzymes (eg, matrix metalloproteinases, aggrecanases). IAHA was also reported to enhance the synthesis of intrinsic proteoglycan (eg, aggrecan) and glycosaminoglycans, thus delaying the progression of OA. IAHA also reported improvement in the mechanical function of the knee by increasing the viscosity of the synovial fluid, reducing the coefficient of friction, and improving its lubrication. Overall, a significant decrease in knee pain was observed after IAHA treatments. CONCLUSION: Preclinical and clinical studies established evidence for varied MoAs by which IAHA preparations may produce a desired effect in patients with knee OA."

Since porcine skin cannot fully mimic biological responses in human skin, we now describe an ex vivo system using \"full thickness\" human skin. Spongiosis and epidermal detachment were the primary endpoints to evaluate skin structural integrity over a 9-day culture period. Epidermal barrier function and basal cell proliferation were monitored using expression of claudin-1 and Ki-67, respectively. Immunofluorescent staining of type I and type III procollagens and elastin after subcutaneous injection of TGF-β3, a cross-linked hyaluronic acid hydrogel, and saline solution and \"no treatment\" controls, showed that the model enabled visualization of changes in extracellular matrix proteins. Semi-quantitative, automated image analysis methods using multiple ROIs were evaluated to assess signal intensity and expression area of type I procollagen but displayed high inter-regional variability due to skin sample heterogeneity. Absolute quantitative methods, e.g. RT-qPCR or ELISA, which enable determination of biomarkers at either the mRNA level or the amounts of protein expressed in the sample, could be a better reporting tool. In conclusion, we successfully developed an ex vivo \"full thickness\" human skin model that retained viability over 9 days and which could be deployed in combination with qualitative/quantitative methods to evaluate local biological effects of subcutaneously injected biomacromolecules.",
