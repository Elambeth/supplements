      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Slowed somatosensory conduction in multiple sclerosis (MS) increases postural instability and decreases proprioception. Despite these delays, individuals with MS rely more on proprioception for balance compared to controls. This heightened reliance, combined with slowed signal transduction, increases fall risk. Backward walking (BW) increases proprioceptive reliance by reducing visual cues. However, no study has conclusively linked proprioception to BW. This study aims to assess proprioception's role in BW compared to forward walking (FW) in MS and to compare differences in proprioception between MS fallers and non-fallers. METHODS: Fifty participants (average age: 50.34 ± 11.84, median Patient Determined Disease Steps [PDDS]: 2) completed the study. Participants completed BW and FW at comfortable and fast speeds. We have previously established vibration sensation as a proxy measure for proprioception. Vibration thresholds were quantified at the great toe bilaterally using a 2-alternative forced-choice procedure. RESULTS: Significant correlations were seen for vibration sensation and FW comfortable ( ρ  = 0.35), FW fast ( ρ  = 0.34), BW comfortable ( ρ  = 0.46), and BW fast ( ρ  = 0.46). After controlling for age, sex, and PDDS, vibration sensation significantly predicted performance during all walking tasks, with larger beta coefficients seen during BW (comfortable β  = 0.57; fast β  = 0.58) compared to FW (comfortable β  = 0.41; fast β  = 0.45). Fallers performed significantly worse than non-fallers for vibration sensation ( P = 0.04). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Considering the notable decrease in proprioception in participants with MS and the clear distinction between fallers and non-fallers, it is crucial to conduct fall risk assessments and interventions focusing on proprioception. With its heightened reliance on proprioception, BW offers a promising method for assessing fall risk and could be an effective exercise intervention.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In people who have had stroke, are the effects of backward walking comparable with forward walking for improving walking (i.e. speed, cadence, and stride length)? Does the addition of backward walking to forward walking help improve the benefits of forward walking? Are any benefits maintained beyond intervention? METHODS: A systematic review of randomized trials, with adults following stroke, was developed. The intervention of interest was backward walking training, delivered either as a solo intervention or in combination with forward walking training. The outcome measures of interest were walking speed, cadence, and stride length. RESULTS: The effect of backward walking training is similar as or better than that of forward walking training for improving walking speed (MD 0.16 m/s, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.27), but results for cadence and stride length were very imprecise. The addition of backward walking training to forward walking training provided negligible effects on walking speed (MD 0.03 m/s, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04), cadence (MD 5 steps/min, 95% CI 1 to 10), and stride length (MD 0.04 m, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.09). Maintenance of effects beyond the intervention period remains uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: This review provided moderate-quality evidence that backward walking training is slightly better than forward walking training for improving walking speed after stroke, but not when it is additional to forward walking training. Large and well-designed trials are warranted to strengthen the evidence regarding backward walking training, especially in the subacute phase after stroke."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Badminton, a dynamic sport, demands players to display exceptional physical attributes such as agility, core stability, and reaction time. Backward walking training on a treadmill has garnered attention for its potential to enhance physical attributes and optimize performance in athletes while minimizing the risk of injuries. OBJECTIVE: By investigating the efficacy of this novel approach, we aim to provide valuable insights to optimize training regimens and contribute to the advancement of sports science in badminton. METHODOLOGY: Sixty-four participants were randomized into a control group (n = 32) and an experimental group (n = 32). The control group received routine exercise training, while the experimental group received routine exercise training along with additional backward walking training on the treadmill. Pre- and post-intervention measurements were taken for core stability using the Plank test, balance using the Star Excursion Balance test, reaction time using the 6-point footwork test, and agility using the Illinois Agility test. RESULTS: The results showed that the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in core stability (p < 0.001), balance (p < 0.001), reaction time (p < 0.05), and agility (p < 0.001) compared to the control group. The backward walking training proved to be effective in enhancing these physical attributes in badminton players. CONCLUSION: Incorporating backward walking exercises into the training regimen of badminton players may contribute to their overall performance."

      "abstract": "Balance impairment and accidental falls are a pervasive challenge faced by persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), significantly impacting their quality of life. While exercise has proven to be an effective intervention for improving mobility and functioning in PwMS, current exercise approaches predominantly emphasize forward walking (FW) and balance training, with variable improvements in balance and fall rates. Backward walking (BW) has emerged as a promising intervention modality for enhancing mobility and strength outcomes; however, significant gaps remain. Specifically, there is limited knowledge about the efficacy of BW interventions on outcomes such as static, anticipatory, and reactive balance, balance confidence, falls, and cognition. This randomized controlled trial aims to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of 8-weeks of backward walking training (TRAIN-BW) as compared to forward walking training (TRAIN-FW). Ninety individuals with MS with self-reported walking dysfunction or ≥ 2 falls in the past 6 months will be randomized in blocks, stratified by sex and disease severity to either the TRAIN-BW or TRAIN-FW intervention groups. Adherence and retention rates will be used to determine feasibility and the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire will be used to assess acceptability. The primary outcomes will be static, anticipatory, and reactive balance. Secondary outcomes include walking velocity, balance confidence, concern about falling, cognition, physical activity, and fall rates measured prospectively for 6 months after post-testing. Additionally, the extent to which cognitive functioning influences response to intervention will be examined. Backward walking training may be an innovative intervention to address balance impairments and falls in persons with MS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience mobility impairments that elevate fall risk, increasing the need to identify clinical measures that accurately predict falls. Backward walking (BW) better differentiates fallers from nonfallers in MS. However, no studies have reported the measurement properties of the backward walking Timed 25-Foot Walk (B-T25-FW) and BW metrics, like BW velocity. Additionally, it is unknown whether BW can predict future falls in MS or its link to activity levels. This study assessed the reliability and responsiveness of B-T25-FW and BW metrics, including BW velocity. It also examined whether BW could predict falls at 3 and 6 months and its association with activity levels. METHODS: During 2 separate visits, 23 people with MS completed the forward walking Timed 25-Foot Walk (F-T25-FW) and B-T25-FW, as well as forward walking and BW assessments in which spatiotemporal measures were recorded. Test-retest reliability was determined with intraclass correlation coefficients, and minimum detectable changes were calculated. Correlation analyses explored the relationship between BW velocity, B-T25-FW, prospective falls, and activity levels. RESULTS: B-T25-FW and BW velocity exhibited excellent test-retest reliability. Large effect sizes to interpret clinically meaningful change in the B-T25-FW and BW velocity were also found. Both metrics demonstrated modest negative correlations with falls at 3 and 6 months and correlated strongly with very active minutes at 3- and 6-months post study. CONCLUSIONS: The B-T25-FW and BW velocity are effective and reliable in clinical use for evaluating functional mobility in people with MS, are sensitive enough to detect subtle changes, and may be a meaningful marker for tracking disease progression and treatment efficacy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Backward walking training (BWT) can have a positive effect on balance, gait, and functional mobility in neurological diseases; however, the effectiveness of BWT has not been examined in multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the effects of BWT on balance, gait, and functional mobility in people with MS (PwMS). METHOD: Nineteen PwMS were randomly allocated to either the experimental group (n=10) and the control group (n=9). The experimental group received BWT in addition to conventional walking training (CWT) while the control group only received CWT. Both groups performed training three times a week for 8 weeks. Participants were assessed with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), four square step test (FSST), activities-specific balance confidence scale (ABC), timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW), dynamic gait index (DGI), 3-meter backward walk test (3MBWT), Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12), and timed up and go test (TUG) before and after training. RESULTS: After training, both groups showed significant improvements on the T25FW, and TUG (p<0.05) while only the experimental group showed significant improvements on the BBS, FSST, ABC, DGI, 3MBWT, and MSWS-12 (p<0.05). The experimental group significantly improved more than the control group in all outcomes (p<0.05) except for the T25FW (p=0.202). CONCLUSION: BWT in addition to CWT is an effective way to improve balance, gait, and functional mobility for PwMS. These results suggest that BWT may be a potentially useful treatment approach when added to CWT in the rehabilitation of MS.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at an increased fall risk due to motor and cognitive dysfunction. Our past studies suggest that backward walking (BW) velocity predicts fall risk; however, specific cognitive domains associated with BW velocity remain understudied. The goal of this study was to determine the specific contributions of cognitive functioning to BW velocity in persons with MS. We hypothesized that better visuospatial memory, verbal immediate recall, and faster information processing speed would contribute to faster BW velocity, and deficits in these domains would partially account for disease severity-related impairment in BW velocity. METHODS: Participants completed demographic questionnaires, walking tests, and cognitive assessments. Applied structural equation modeling was used to test our hypothesized model of competing cognitive mediators. Within the model, disease severity was a predictor of BW via three intercorrelated cognitive mediators. RESULTS: Participants included 39 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS. Results indicated that 35.3% of the significant total effect of disease severity on BW was accounted for by specific cognitive deficits. Verbal immediate recall had the largest contribution, followed by visuospatial memory and information processing speed. CONCLUSIONS: When examining the unique effects of cognitive domains on disease severity-related deficits in BW, a meaningful source of impairment related to visuospatial memory and verbal immediate recall was demonstrated. Considering the utility of BW velocity as a predictor of falls, these results highlight the importance of assessing cognition when evaluating fall risk in MS. Cognitive-based intervention studies investigating fall prevention may find BW as a more specific and sensitive predictor of fall risk than forward walking."

A systematic review of randomized trials was conducted. Trials had to include children with cerebral palsy, with a Gross Motor Function Classification System, between I and III, that delivered backward walking training as a solo intervention or in combination with forward walking training. The outcomes of interest were walking speed and balance. The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by the PEDro scale, and the quality of evidence was assessed according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Eight papers, involving 156 participants, were included. Using random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated that backward walking training improved walking speed by 0.10 m/s [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05-0.16] and by 2 points on the Pediatric Balance Scale (0-56) (95% CI 1.5-2.2) more than forward walking training. We also estimated that the addition of backward walking training increased walking speed by 0.20 m/s (95% CI 0.07-0.34) and reduced the angular excursion of the center of gravity by 0.5 degrees (95% CI -0.7 to -0.3). The quality of the evidence was classified as low to moderate. In conclusion, overall, backward walking training appears to be as effective or slightly superior to forward walking training for improving walking speed in children with CP. The addition of backward walking training statistically significantly and clinically important enhanced benefits on walking speed.",

METHODS: The study is a single blind randomized clinical trial with two independent groups. This study will enroll 26 participants with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. The participants will be randomized into either experimental group (backward walking exercise) or control group (forward walking exercise). Both groups will use lower body positive pressure treadmill for walking exercise. Both groups will perform regular conventional exercise and worm-up exercise before walking exercise. The treatment will be three times a week for six weeks. Walking session will be up to 30 min each session. Data collection will be collected during pre- and post- intervention including primary outcomes including numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and thigh muscle strength test. The secondary outcomes include five times sit to stand test (FTSTS), 3-meter backward walk test (3MBWT), timed up and go test (TUG), four square step test (FSST), functional reach test (FRT), 10-meter walk test (10-MWT), six minute walk test (6MWT), medical outcomes study short form 12 (SF-12), patient health questionnaire -9 (PHQ-9), and rapid assessment of physical activity (RAPA). An independent t-test will be used to evaluate the effect of treatment on the outcome measures. RESULTS: Not applicable. CONCLUSION: Using lower body positive pressure may have promising results against knee osteoarthritis. Moreover, walking backward exercise using lower body positive pressure might add more benefits to individuals with knee osteoarthritis and help clinicians in decision making.

AIM: To investigate the PFC hemodynamics during forward and as well as backward walking, with and without a cognitive task, in pwMS and healthy controls. DESIGN: Observational case-control study. SETTING: Sheba Multiple Sclerosis Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. POPULATION: Eighteen pwMS (36.1±11.7 years, 66.6% female) and 17 healthy controls (37.5±13.8 years, 76.5% female). METHODS: Each subject completed four walking trials: ST forward walking, DT forward walking, ST backward walking, DT backward walking. PFC activity for all trials was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The PFC was subdivided in the frontal eye field (FEF), frontopolar cortex (FPC) and the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC). RESULTS: The relative oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) concentration was higher during the DT forward walking in all PFC subareas compared with the ST forward walking for both groups. The relative HbO concentration was higher during ST backward walking compared with ST forward walking in pwMS (DLPFC, FEF) and the healthy controls (FEF, FPC), specifically during the initial part of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: ST backward walking and DT forward walking impact the hemodynamics at the PFC, although, the difference between pwMS and healthy adults requires further clarification. Future RCT's are encouraged to examine the impact of an intervention program based on DT forward and backward walking on PFC activity in pwMS. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Backward walking increases activity in the PFC region in pwMS. Similarly, when performing a cognitive task while walking forward.",

OBJECTIVE: To identify whether backward walking with functional electrical stimulation (FES) triggered by a foot switch on the rectus femoris and tibialis anterior could be effective in improving gait parameters of stroke survivors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that included fourteen subjects with chronic stroke. Three walking conditions were performed at random: backward walking with FES attached onto the rectus femoris and tibialis anterior (RF+TA), backward walking with FES attached onto the tibialis anterior (TA only), and without electrical intervention (non-FES). The Zebris was used to assess the spatiotemporal gait parameters. Each condition was measured three times and the average value was used for analysis. RESULTS: Results showed significant increases in gait speed, cadence, step length, mid-stance percentage, maximal force in the affected midfoot (p < 0.05), and significant decreases in the double stance phase in the RF+TA condition compared to the TA only and the non-FES conditions (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Functional electrical stimulation to the rectus femoris and tibialis anterior during backward walking could be a clinically effective method to improve gait ability of stroke survivors.",

However, previous studies showed that BW significantly increased the first vertical ground reaction force (GRF) during gait, which might lead to higher loading at the knee. Published reports have not examined the effects of BW on medial compartment knee loading. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of BW on external knee adduction moment (EKAM). Twenty-seven healthy adults participated in the present study. A sixteen-camera three-dimensional VICON gait analysis system, with two force platforms, was used to collect the EKAM, KAAI, and other biomechanical data during BW and forward walking (FW). The first (P < 0.001) and second (P < 0.001) EKAM peaks and KAAI (P=0.02) were significantly decreased during BW when compared with FW. The BW significantly decreased the lever arm length at the first EKAM peak (P=0.02) when compared with FW. In conclusion, BW was found to be a useful strategy for reducing the medial compartment knee loading even though the first peak ground reaction force was significantly increased.",

This was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a crossover design conducted at a single facility. METHODS: Among 12 children with cerebral palsy, the forward (FWG) (n = 6) and backward walking groups (BWG) (n = 6) underwent training three times a week for 4 weeks, 40 min a day. After a 6-week break, the crossover training was conducted. Functional walking variables were measured. Time-Up-and-Go (TUG) test, Figure-8 Walk Test (FW8T), and Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS) were used for measuring balance. RESULTS: Both groups showed significant improvement in walking speed, stride length, and step length. The BWG demonstrated significant improvement in walking speed (p < 0.05) compared with the FWG. The TUG test, FW8T, and PBS showed significant improvement. After the 4-week intervention, both groups displayed a remarkable decrease in TUG duration and FW8T. Both groups also exhibited improvement in the PBS; more so in the BWG. CONCLUSIONS: Backward walking training with motor dual tasks could be a more effective interventional approach than forward walking training to improve balance and walking functions of children with spastic hemiplegia."

Moreover, action observation training could be a potential intervention to improve gait after a stroke. AIM: We aimed to identify the effects of BW action observational training (BWOT) on gait parameters and balance in chronic stroke patients. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Rehabilitation center. POPULATION: Twenty-four chronic stroke patients were randomly assigned to BWOT (N.=12) and landscape observational training (LOT) (N.=12) groups. METHODS: The BWOT group performed BW after watching a video of a BW, while the LOT group performed BW training after watching a video of a landscape. Both groups received traditional therapy for 5 days per week and BWOT for 3 days a week for 4 weeks. The primary and secondary outcomes were gait and balance, respectively. Static balance was measured using the 5 Times Sit-To-Stand Test (5TSTS), the center of pressure (COP) displacement, and weight distribution (WD) of the affected side. Dynamic balance was measured using the activity-specific balance confidence (ABC) scale. RESULTS: The BWOT group showed significant improvements in gait velocity (p=0.001, η2=0.470), step length (P=0.007, η2=0.313), stride lengths (P<0.002, η2=0.431), 5TSTS (P=0.021, η2=0.231), COP velocity (P=0.022, η2=0.226), length (P=0.001, η2=0.504), WD of the affected side (P=0.033, η2=0.193), and ABC score (P=0.023, η2=0.226) than the LOT group. CONCLUSIONS: The 4-week BWOT training program significantly improved the gait parameters and static and dynamic balance in stroke patients. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: BWOT is an accessible and effective method of rehabilitation training that can also be applied to conventional therapy as a useful method for improving the gait and balance after stroke.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of backward walking (BW) on static stability, proprioception, pain, and physical function in KOA patients. METHODS: Thirty-two subjects with knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either an BW group (BG, n = 16) or a control group (CG, n = 16). The participants in the BG received combination treatment of a 4-week BW training and conventional treatments, while those in the CG was treated with conventional treatments alone. All the participants were tested for the assessment of static stability [center of pressure (COP) sway, including sway length (SL, mm) and sway area (SA, mm2)] and proprioception [average trajectory error (ATE, %) and completion time (CT, second)]. Additionally, pain and knee function scores were measured by the numerical rating scale (NRS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index, respectively. The assessments were conducted before and after intervention. RESULTS: The COP sway (SA and SL), ATE, NRS, and WOMAC showed a significant decline at week 4 in the two groups in contrast to their baseline (P < 0.05). Moreover, after 4-week intervention, the SA [(610.50 ± 464.26) mm2 vs. (538.69 ± 420.52) mm2], NRS [(1.56 ± 0.63) vs. (2.25 ± 0.86)], and WOMAC [(11.69 ± 2.50) vs. (16.19 ± 3.94)] showed a significantly greater decrease in the BG compared to the CG (P < 0.05, respectively). However, the proprioception (ATE and CT) was closely similar between both groups at week 4 (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: BW is an effective adjunct to conventional treatment in reducing pain, improving physical function and static stability for KOA patients. It should be taken into consideration when developing rehabilitation programs for people with KOA."

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does exercise influence backward walking speed in people with dementia, when tested using habitual walking aids and without, and do effects differ according to walking aid use? METHODS: This study included 141 women and 45 men (mean age 85 years) with dementia from the Umeå Dementia and Exercise (UMDEX), a cluster-randomized controlled trial study set in 16 nursing homes in Umeå, Sweden. Participants were randomized to a High-Intensity Functional Exercise (HIFE) program targeting lower limb strength-, balance and mobility exercise or to a seated attention control activity. Blinded assessors measured 2.4-meter usual backward walking speed, at baseline, 4 - (intervention completion) and 7-month follow-up; tested 1) with habitual walking aids allowed, and 2) without walking aids. RESULTS: Linear mixed models showed no between-group effect in either backward walking speed test at 4 or 7 months; test 1) 0.005 m/s, P = .788 and -0.006 m/s, P = .754 and test 2) 0.030 m/s, P = .231 and 0.015 m/s, P = .569, respectively. In interaction analyses, exercise effects differed significantly between participants who habitually walked unaided compared with those that used a walking aid at 7 months (0.094 m/s, P = .027). SIGNIFICANCE: In this study of older people with dementia living in nursing homes, the effects of exercise had no overall effects on backwards walking speed. Nevertheless, some benefit was indicated in participants who habitually walked unaided, which is promising and merits further investigation in future studies.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Backward walking (BW) is otherwise known as retrowalking. As opposed to forward walking, BW is a countersequential exercise and is a common method of rehabilitation training and disease-assisted treatment. Studies have shown that BW has a helpful effect on improving lower limb proprioception, gait synergy and improving limb balance. Many studies have concluded that BW can improve the symptoms of patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and can be used for rehabilitation and adjunctive treatment of KOA, but there is a lack of evidence-based medical evidence.This research aims to provide an update to the most recent available evidence on the effect of BW on patients with KOA . METHODS AND ANALYSES: Electronic databases, such as Ovid/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed, will be searched by us. We will include studies identified from citation until 12 May 2020 and will not be restricted by geographical setting. The search will not be limited to the language of the publication, but the study of human subjects. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the BW training of KOA will be included, with outcome measures including pain, knee function or balance function. The quality of included RCTs will be evaluated according to the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. A meta-analysis or systematic review will be performed to summarise the effects of BW training. We will perform sensitivity analysis on the sample size of RCTs, meta-regression analysis of the follow-up periods, dosages and baselines of outcome measures, and publication bias analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required as this study will not involve confidential personal data. The results of this study will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal.

Contemporary treatment paradigms recommend backward walking (BW) to improve locomotion in people with musculoskeletal disorders. The purpose of this study was to determine whether muscle activity and activation variability during BW differs between subjects with and without CAI. METHODS: Sixteen participants with CAI and 16 healthy controls walked on a treadmill at their self-selected speed under BW and forward walking (FW) conditions. Surface electromyography (EMG) data for the peroneus longus, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius and gluteus medius muscles were collected. EMG amplitude normalized to maximum voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) and the standard deviation (SD) of the %MVIC EMG amplitude was calculated throughout the gait cycle. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) of the %MVIC EMG amplitude was calculated before and after initial contact (pre-IC: 90-100% of stride; post-IC: 0-10% of stride). RESULTS: No differences between groups were noted in the %MVIC amplitude or activation variability (SD of %MVIC EMG) under BW or FW. In both groups, decreased tibialis anterior (p < 0.001) and gluteus medius (p = 0.01), and increased medial gastrocnemius (p < 0.001) activation were observed during pre- and post-IC under BW condition. CONCLUSION: Participants with CAI and healthy controls have similar muscle activity patterns during BW. Yet, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity of the CAI population.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of BW training on patients with stroke. METHODS: A keyword search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published until November, 2019. Two investigators screened the articles and extract data from each included study. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the effect of BW on stroke. In addition, the quality of evidence was evaluated by GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation; version:3.6) approach. RESULTS: A total of ten studies were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the review. All included studies described some positive influences of BW on stroke relative to the control group (forward walking or conventional treatment). Compared to control group, there is a statistically significant improvement for BW group in gait velocity (mean difference [MD] = 6.87, 95%CI: [1.40, 12.33], P = .01, I = 3%), Berg balance score (MD =3.82, 95%CI: [2.12, 5.52], P < .0001, I = 0%), and walk test (MD =0.11, 95%CI: [0.02, 0.20], P = .02, I = 36%).

Backward walking (BW) is an emerging training approach; however, its application to patient populations consistent with those in IR is limited. Objectives: To describe the effects of an additional BW training program to standard IR care on balance, walking ability and fall-risk in a heterogenic caseload of adults <2 weeks post-stroke with a broad range of lesion locations and physical sequelae. Methods: Eight patients with first-time stroke (5 male; average age 66.5 ± 11.7 years; average stroke onset 7.6 ± 1.6 days; 6 right hemiparesis) participated in 10-daily sessions that included 20 min of over ground BW training for each session, in addition to standard IR. Standard outcome measures were used to assess balance, walking ability and fall-risk at admission and post-intervention. Results: All eight patients demonstrated improvements in all outcomes with a clinically meaningful increase in forward walking speed, as measured by 10MWT. Four participants exceeded fall-risk cut-off scores for all balance-related outcome measures. Conclusions: In a diverse patient population early after stroke, individuals successfully participated in an additional BW training program. Despite the patients' acuity and severe impairments in walking, significant gains in balance and walking function were noted. This program may be useful in improving outcomes with patient characteristics commonly seen in IR.",

DESIGN:: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and quasi-randomized control studies. DATA SOURCES:: Searched from the date of inception to March 2018, and included PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PEDro, CINAHL, and the MEDLINE databases. METHODS:: Investigating the effects of backward walking on pain, functional disability, muscle strength, gait parameters, balance, stability, and plantar pressure in people with gait impairments. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality. Similar outcomes were pooled by calculating the standardized mean difference. RESULTS:: Of the 21 studies (neurological 11 and musculoskeletal 10), 635 participants were included. The average PEDro score was 5.4/10. The meta-analysis demonstrated significant standardized mean difference values in favour of backward walking, with conventional physiotherapy treatment for two to four weeks to reduce pain (-0.87) and functional disability (-1.19) and to improve quadriceps strength (1.22) in patients suffering from knee osteoarthritis. The balance and stability in cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and gait parameters and muscle strength in anterior cruciate ligament injury improved significantly when backward walking was included as an exercise. There was no significant evidence in favour of backward walking in any of the other conditions. CONCLUSION:: The systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that backward walking with conventional physiotherapy treatment is effective and clinically worthwhile in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Insufficient evidence was available for the remaining gait impairment conditions and no conclusions could be drawn.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Strategies to address gait and balance deficits early poststroke are minimal. The postural and motor control requirements of Backward Walking Training (BWT) may provide benefits to improve balance and walking speed in this population. This pilot study (1) determined the feasibility of administering BWT during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) compared the effectiveness of BWT to Standing Balance Training (SBT) on walking speed, balance, and balance-related efficacy in acute stroke. METHODS: Eighteen individuals 1-week poststroke were randomized to eight, 30-minute sessions of BWT or SBT in addition to scheduled therapy. Five-Meter Walk Test, 3-Meter Backward Walk Test, Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Sensory Organization Test, and Function Independence Measure-Mobility were assessed pre- and postintervention and at 3 months poststroke. RESULTS: Forward gait speed change (BWT: 0.75 m/s; SBT: 0.41 m/s), assessed by the 5-Meter Walk Test, and backward gait speed change (BWT: 0.53 m/s; SBT: 0.23 m/s), assessed by the 3-Meter Backward Walk Test, preintervention to 1-month retention were greater for BWT than for SBT (P < 0.05). Group difference effect size from preintervention to 1-month retention was large for Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, moderate for Berg Balance Scale and Function Independence Measure-Mobility, and small for Sensory Organization Test. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Individuals 1-week poststroke tolerated 30 min/d of additional therapy. At 1-month postintervention, BWT resulted in greater improvements in both forward and backward walking speed than SBT. Backward walking training is a feasible important addition to acute stroke rehabilitation. Future areas of inquiry should examine BWT as a preventative modality for future fall incidence.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A193).",

DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Physical therapy clinics. SUBJECTS: A total of 30 children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy of both sexes (10 to 14 years of age, classified as I or II by gross motor function classification system) participated in this study. They were randomly assigned into two equal groups. INTERVENTIONS: Both groups received a conventional physical therapy program for 12 successive weeks (three sessions per week). The experimental group additionally received (25 min) backward walking training. The control group additionally received (25 min) forward walking training. OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up assessment for spatiotemporal gait parameters and gross motor functions were evaluated by using three dimensional gait analysis system and gross motor function measures. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in step length, walking velocity, cadence, stance phase, and swing phase percentage and gross motor function measures (Dimensions D and E) of the experimental group (0.55 ±0.16, 0.53 ±0.19, 121.73 ±2.89, 54.73 ±1.67, 44.40 ±1.40, 90.20 ±6.44, 82.47 ±12.82), respectively, than the control group (0.39 ±0.13, 0.46 ±0.20, 125.80 ±2.96, 50.27 ±1.62, 49.47 ±1.55, 82.47 ±7.05, 80.47 ±12.61), respectively, ( p < 0.05). The significant improvement of all measured outcomes of the experimental group was maintained at 1 month follow-up assessment ( p < 0.05).

DESIGN: Fifty-one subjects with hemiplegic stroke were randomly allocated to 3 groups, each containing 17 subjects: the control group, the backward walking training group, and the lateral walking training group. The walking abilities of each group were assessed using a 10-m walk test and the GAITRite system for spatiotemporal gait. RESULTS: The results show that there were significantly greater posttest increases in gait velocity (F = -12.09, P = 0.02) and stride length (F = -11.50, P = 0.02), decreases in the values of the 10-m walk test (F = -7.10, P = 0.03) (P < 0.05) and double-limb support period (F = 40.15, P = 0.000), and improvements in gait asymmetry (F = 13.88, P = 0.002) (P < 0.01) in subjects in the lateral walking training group compared with those in the other 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that asymmetric gait patterns in poststroke patients could be improved by receiving additional lateral walking training therapy rather than backward walking training.

[Subjects and Methods] A total of 36 chronic stroke patients were divided into three groups with 12 subjects in each group. Each of the groups performed one of the progressive body weight supported treadmill training methods for 30 minute, six times per week for three weeks, and then received general physical therapy without any other intervention until the follow-up tests. For the assessment of the affected side lower extremity's walking ability, step length of the affected side, stance phase of the affected side, swing phase of the affected side, single support of the affected side, and step time of the affected side were measured using optogait and the symmetry index. [Results] In the within group comparisons, all the three groups showed significant differences between before and after the intervention and in the comparison of the three groups, the PBWSTFBWT group showed more significant differences in all of the assessed items than the other two groups. [Conclusion] In the present study progressive body weight supported treadmill training was performed in an environment in which the subjects were actually walked, and PBWSTFBWT was more effective at efficiently training stroke patients' affected side lower extremity's walking ability."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Residual walking deficits are common in people after stroke. Treadmill training can increase walking speed and walking distance. A new way to increase the challenge of walking is to walk backwards. Backward treadmill walking may provide advantages by promoting improvement in balance, walking spatiotemporal parameters and quality that may reflect in improving walking distance. AIM: This study will test the hypothesis that backward treadmill walking is superior to forward treadmill walking in improving walking capacity, walking parameters, quality and balance in people with stroke. DESIGN: A prospective, single-blinded, randomized trial will randomly allocate 88 community-dwelling people after stroke into either an experimental or control group. The experimental group will undertake 30-min sessions of backward treadmill walking, three-days/week for six-weeks, while the control group will undertake the same dose of forward treadmill walking. Training will begin at the baseline overground walking speed and will increase each week by 10% of baseline speed. STUDY OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be distance walked in the 6-min Walk Test. Secondary outcomes will be walking speed, step length, cadence, and one-leg stance time. Outcomes will be collected by a researcher blinded to group allocation at baseline (Week 0), at the end of training period (Week 6), and three-months after the cessation of intervention (Week 18). DISCUSSION: If backward treadmill walking can improve walking capacity more than forward treadmill training in stroke, it may have broader implications because walking capacity has been shown to predict physical activity level and community participation.",

SETTING: Clinical and laboratory setting. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with DPN (N=60) were divided into the test group (n=30) or control group (n=30). INTERVENTIONS: Backward walking exercise with ALA treatment for the test group; lipoic acid treatment for the control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Plantar pressure before and after treatment was tested and analyzed with the flatbed plantar pressure measurement system. RESULTS: After treatment, peak plantar pressure in the forefoot dropped for both the test and control groups; peak plantar pressure for the test group dropped significantly. Peak plantar pressure in the medial foot slightly increased for the test group, suggesting a more even distribution of plantar pressure in the test group after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of ALA and backward walking proved to be more effective than ALA monotherapy. Backward walking also proved to have an ameliorating effect on balance ability and muscle strength of patients with DPN.",

There is no research evaluating the effect of backward walking (BW) using BWSTT in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of this single subject design was to examine the differences between forward walking (FW) and BW training using BWSTT in an individual with quadriparesis. METHODS: The participant was a 57-year-old male with incomplete C3-C6 SCI. An ABABAB design (A = BW; B = FW; each phase = 3 weeks of biweekly sessions) was utilized. Outcome measures included: gait parameters; a timed 4-meter walk; the 5-repetition sit-to-stand test (STST); tandem stance time; and 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Data was analyzed with split level method of trend estimation. RESULTS: Improvements in gait parameters, on the timed 4-meter walk, 6MWT, tandem balance and aerobic endurance were similar with FW and BW training. The only difference between FW and BW training was that BW training resulted in greater improvements in the STST. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that in this individual backward walking training was advantageous, resulting in improved ability to perform the 5-repetition STST. It is suspected that these changes can be attributed to the differences in muscle activation and task difficulty between FW and BW.",

Twelve participants aged 5-15 years with spastic cerebral palsy participated in this study. The BW training was conducted on a treadmill for up to 20 min, with three sessions per week for 8 consecutive weeks. Before each treadmill training session, lower limb stretching was included in the session. Interlimb differentials of vertical ground reaction force while standing, temporal-distance gait parameters, and scores of dimension D and dimension E of the GMFM were determined. Participants showed statistically significant improvements in a measure of GMFM (P<0.01) and weight-bearing symmetry value (P<0.05), forward walking velocity (P<0.05), and step/stride length (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Falls remain a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. It is suggested that backward walking (BW) may offer some benefits especially in balance and motor control ability beyond those experienced through forward walking (FW), and may be a potential intervention for prevention of falls. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of BW on balance in boys. METHODS: Sixteen healthy boys (age: 7.19 ± 0.40 y) were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. The experimental group participated in a BW training program (12-week, 2 times weekly, and 25-min each time) but not the control group. Both groups had five dynamic balance assessments with a Biodex Stability System (anterior/posterior, medial/lateral, and overall balance index) before, during and after the training (week- 0, 4, 8, 12, 24). Six control and six experimental boys participated in a study comparing kinematics of lower limbs between FW and BW after the training (week-12). RESULTS: The balance of experimental group was better than that of control group after 8 weeks of training (P < 0.01), and was still better than that of control group (P < 0.05), when the BW training program had finished for 12 weeks. The kinematic analysis indicated that there was no difference between control and experimental groups in the kinematics of both FW and BW gaits after the BW training (P > 0.05). Compared to FW, the duration of stance phase of BW tended to be longer, while the swing phase, stride length, walking speed, and moving ranges of the thigh, calf and foot of BW decreased (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Backward walking training in school-aged boys can improve balance."

      "abstract": "The brains of ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients display an aberrant loss of Purkinje cells (PCs) that is postulated to contribute to the observed deficits in motor coordination as well as in learning and cognitive function. AT patients have mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene [Savitsky et al. (1995) Science 268:1749-1753]. However, in Atm-deficient mice, the neurological defects are limited, and the PCs are not deformed or lost as observed in AT patients [Barlow et al. (1996) Cell 86:159-171]. Here we report that PC-specific deletion of the mouse males absent on the first (mMof) gene (Cre(-)), which encodes a protein that specifically acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) and influences ATM function, is critical for PC longevity. Mice deficient for PC-specific Mof display impaired motor coordination, ataxia, a backward-walking phenotype, and a reduced life span. Treatment of Mof(F/F)/Pcp2-Cre(+) mice with histone deacetylase inhibitors modestly prolongs PC survival and delays death. Therefore, Mof expression and H4K16 acetylation are essential for PC survival and function, and their absence leads to PC loss and cerebellar dysfunction similar to that observed in AT patients.",

METHODS: Twenty-six patients with stroke, 17 males and 9 females, aged 36 - 64, with the lower extremity Brunnstrom motor recovery stage at 3 or 4, able to walk for 10 m without walking aid or orthosis, were randomly divided into two equal groups: The patients in the control group were to participate in a 60-minutes conventional training five times a week for three weeks, and the patients in the experimental group received 30-minute conventional training and then 30-minute backward walking training five times a week for three weeks. Before the training and 3 weeks after the training, Fugl-Meyer assessment was used to assess the motor function of the lower extremity (FMA-L), Berg balance scale (BBS) was used to assess the balance function, and 10 m maximum walking speed was measured. RESULTS: After the three-week training period, the FMA-L score of the experimental group was 28.0 +/- 3.3, significantly higher than that of the control group (25.5 +/- 2.3, P = 0.033); the BBS score of the experimental group was 51.4 +/- 1.8, significantly higher than that of the control group (47.3 +/- 3.7, P = 0.001, and 10 m MWS of the experimental group was 57 +/- 17, significantly higher than that of the control group (43 +/- 16, P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: A safe and feasible intervention, additional backward walking therapy helps improve the damaged motor function, balance, and walking speed of the patients with stroke.",

SETTING: Medical centre. SUBJECTS: Twenty-five subjects with stroke, who were lower extremity Brunnstrom motor recovery stage at 3 or 4 and were able to walk 11 m with or without a walking aid or orthosis, randomly allocated to two groups, control (n = 12) and experimental (n = 13). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects in both groups participated in 40 min of conventional training programme three times a week for three weeks. Subjects in experimental group received additional 30 min of backward walking training for three weeks at a frequency of three times per week. MAIN MEASURES: Gait was measured using the Stride Analyzer. Gait parameters of interest were walking speed, cadence, stride length, gait cycle and symmetry index. Measures were made at baseline before commencement of training (pre-training) and at the end of the three-week training period (post-training). RESULTS: After a three-week training period, subjects in experimental group showed more improvement than those in control group for walking speed (change score: 8.60 +/- 6.95 versus 3.65 +/- 2.92, p-value = 0.032), stride length (change score: 0.090 +/- 0.076 versus -0.0064 +/- 0.078, p-value = 0.006), and symmetry index (change score: 44.07 +/- 53.29 versus 5.30 +/- 13.91, p-value = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that asymmetric gait pattern in patients post stroke could be improved from receiving additional backward walking therapy.",

Researchers have suggested that backward walking decreases the compressive forces at the patellofemoral joint while also preventing overstretching of the anterior cruciate ligament. Prior to this study, precise prescription of backward walking speeds for women was not possible. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between heart rate, oxygen consumption, and backward walking speeds. Twenty-five healthy, adult female volunteers participated in this study. Subjects were tested at speeds of 0.96, 1.20, 1.43, 1.67, and 1.91 m/sec. Subjects also performed a graded exercise stress test. Analysis revealed curvilinear relationships between oxygen consumption and speed as well as between heart rate and speed. With these results, clinicians may now prescribe specific speeds of backward walking for women to elicit a desired cardiopulmonary response.",

They also occurred when smaller doses of (+)-amphetamine (5 mg/kg) and either p-chloroamphetamine (2--5 mg/kg) or fenfluramine (5 mg/kg) were given together. 3 Characteristic dopamine-dependent behaviours (rearing, licking, gnawing) resulting from (+)-amphetamine injection were greatly reduced by p-chloroamphetamine or fenfluramine. 4 Characteristic 5-HT-dependent behaviours (wet dog shake, hind limb abduction) resulting from injection of either p-chloroamphetamine or fenfluramine were unaffected by (+)-amphetamine. 5 Fragmentary backward walking and circling resulting from levallorphan injection (50 mg/kg s.c.) were decreased by (+)-amphetamine at low dosage. 6 Results in general strengthen previous evidence that backward walking and circling are mediated by simultaneous dopamine and 5-HT release. 7 The possible relevance of the above findings to hallucinogenic activity, amphetamine psychosis, schizophrenia and abnormal movements due to L-DOPA treatment is discussed.",
