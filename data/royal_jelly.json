      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential impact of royal jelly (RJ) on hippocampal neurons in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures by assessing luteinizing (LH) and follicle-stimulating (FSH) hormones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six female rats (n=7/group) were divided into groups receiving saline (CTL, OVX, RJ, and OVX-RJ) and those undergoing PTZ-induced seizures (PTZ, PTZ-OVX, PTZ-RJ, and PTZ-OVX-RJ). OVX rats underwent bilateral ovary removal, followed by a 15-day RJ treatment at 300 mg/kg. The seizure model commenced 24 hours after the final RJ dose. Serum LH and FSH levels were measured, and Golgi staining assessed hippocampal neuron morphology. RESULTS: The RJ group exhibited elevated LH and FSH levels compared to CTL. However, the PTZ-RJ group showed no significant changes in these hormones relative to the PTZ and CTL groups. In OVX-RJ rats, LH and FSH levels decreased compared to the RJ group, while PTZ-OVX-RJ rats showed increased levels. Dendritic spines remained unchanged in both the RJ and PTZ-RJ groups compared to the CTL and PTZ groups, respectively. Notably, OVX-RJ exhibited reduced spines compared to the RJ group, while PTZ-OVX-RJ showed an increase. CONCLUSION: RJ may protect against estrogen deficiency and seizure-related adverse effects on hippocampal neurons in OVX rats, highlighting its potential as a beneficial dietary supplement."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system. Royal jelly (RJ), a nutrient-rich substance known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, holds potential in impeding disease progression by mitigating inflammatory processes and oxidative stress. This study was undertaken to explore the impact of RJ on oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in individuals diagnosed with MS. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial involved the allocation of 35 MS patients into two groups: intervention (n = 19) and control (n = 16). The intervention group received daily 500 mg RJ capsules for a duration of 2 months, while the control group received placebo capsules. Prior to and following the intervention, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was ascertained for the patients. Furthermore, the serum levels of inflammatory markers interleukin (IL-1B), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferon (IFN), in addition to the oxidative stress indices catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase, and nitric oxide were evaluated. The data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism software. RESULTS: After the intervention, the mean EDSS score significantly decreased in the case group compared to pre-intervention (P < 0.05). Levels of MDA, IL-1B, TNF, and IFN significantly decreased in the case group post-intervention (P < 0.05). Additionally, a significant increase in CAT enzyme levels was observed in the case group after two months (P < 0.05). In contrast, the control group showed a significant increase in MDA levels after 2 months compared to baseline (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that RJ supplementation may have beneficial effects on inflammatory markers, oxidative stress indices and quality of life in MS patients."

      "abstract": "Royal Jelly (RJ), a traditional medicinal compound with tumor-suppressive properties, was investigated for its antitumor effects on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using a mouse xenograft model. Fifty athymic nude mice were divided into five groups: a control group, an untreated NSCLC group, a doxorubicin (DOX)-treated group, an RJ-treated group, and a combined RJ + DOX treatment group. RJ was administered at 200 mg/kg/day by gavage, while DOX was given intraperitoneally at 80 mg/kg on days 10, 20, and 30. Tumor size, volume, and weight were monitored, and Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed survival. Biochemical and histopathological analyses showed that RJ modulated oxidative stress markers, reduced inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, interferon-γ), and inhibited tumor growth. RJ downregulated STAT3/FOXM1/ATG7 signaling pathways involved in tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis. Additionally, RJ promoted mitochondrial apoptosis through increased p53 expression and reduced angiogenesis by suppressing VEGF. Immunohistochemistry revealed decreased Ki-67 expression, indicating reduced tumor cell proliferation. Molecular analyses confirmed RJ's role in modulating key apoptosis and angiogenesis pathways. When combined with DOX, RJ enhanced therapeutic efficacy, suggesting a synergistic effect. These findings highlight RJ's potential as a therapeutic agent targeting STAT3 and related pathways in NSCLC treatment, offering a promising complementary approach to conventional chemotherapy."

      "abstract": "Vincristine (VCR) is a chemotherapeutic agent classified as a vinca alkaloid. Royal jelly (RJ) is a significant bee product produced by worker bees, characterized by its high protein content. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of RJ against VCR-induced liver damage. VCR was intraperitoneally administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) and RJ was orally administered at doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg b.w. Both treatments were applied to the rats on days 1-6 and 9-14. The composition of RJ was analyzed using LC-MS/MS, revealing the presence of 15 different phytochemical compounds with strong antioxidant properties. Serum samples obtained from the rats were analyzed for ALT, ALP, and AST levels. While these enzyme levels were significantly elevated in the VCR group, a notable reduction was observed following RJ administration. Additionally, SOD, CAT, GPx, and GSH antioxidant parameters, along with MDA levels, were evaluated in liver tissue samples. The results indicated a decrease in SOD, CAT, GPx, and GSH activities/levels and an increase in MDA levels in the VCR group. Furthermore, ELISA was used to assess JAK2, STAT3, and mTOR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. VCR administration led to a decrease in mTOR/PI3K/AKT levels and an increase in JAK2 and STAT3 levels. In addition, the mRNA transcription levels of inflammation (NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (IRE-1, GRP78, PERK, and ATF-6), and autophagy markers (LC3A and LC3B) were examined. A significant increase in inflammation, ER stress, and autophagy-related markers was observed in the VCR-treated group. Lastly, the protein expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and NF-κB were evaluated. VCR treatment increased Bax, Caspase 3, and NF-κB levels, whereas Bcl-2 levels were decreased. However, following RJ administration, all these parameters were reversed, demonstrating significant improvements. In conclusion, these findings suggest that RJ may exert a protective effect against VCR-induced liver damage."

      "abstract": "Phthalate esters, such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP), are extensively utilized and human and animal exposure leads to serious toxic effects, including hepatotoxicity. In the present study the protective effects of royal jelly (RJ) on DBP-induced liver damage was investigated. A total number of 40 Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into eight groups (n = 5): control (corn oil), DBP (500 mg kg-1), RJ (200 mg kg1), Quercetin (QCN; 50.00 mg kg-1), RJ (100 mg kg-1) + DBP, RJ (200 mg kg-1) + DBP, RJ (300 mg kg-1) + DBP, QCN (50.00 mg kg-1) + DBP. After 28 days of daily oral gavage treatment, animals were euthanized. The insulin resistance index, lipid profile and hepatic enzymes were measured on the collected serum samples. Moreover, oxidative and nitrosative stress biomarkers were determined in the liver. Histopathological alterations and ultimately cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) activity was also assessed. Data obtained revealed that RJ significantly reduced the insulin resistance index and liver enzymes level in RJ-DBP groups. At the same time, RJ recovered the DBP-induced oxidative stress and restored the DBP-depleted glutathione. Moreover, RJ improved lipid profile and reduced significantly the DBP-induced hepatic CYP 2E1 activity in RJ-DBP groups. Dibutyl phthalate induced-hepatic damage such as necrosis of hepatocytes and scattered bleeding was alleviated in RJ-DBP group. Our data suggested that the administration of RJ could protect the DBP-induced hepatic functional and structural alterations. The RJ protective effects might be attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and reduced CYP 2E1 activity."

      "abstract": "Royal jelly acid is a unique unsaturated fatty acid isolated from royal jelly. Recently, royal jelly acid was proposed to have potential therapeutic effects on hyperlipidemia. However, its effect on hyperlipidemia and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the mechanism of anti-hyperlipidemia of royal jelly acid through animal experiments and plasma metabolomics in conjunction with human network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses. We found that royal jelly acid could significantly decrease the serum lipid levels, ameliorate hepatic pathological injury, and reduce the level of oxidative stress in the experimental rats. A total of 41 key metabolites and 10 hub targets played key roles in the exertion of anti-hyperlipidemic effects, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), insulin (INS) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A total of 24 pathways, including tryptophan, citrate cycle, and arachidonic acid metabolisms, were identified as the key pathways involved in royal jelly acid-alleviated hyperlipidemia. The present findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment targets of hyperlipidemia as well as contribute to the development and utilization of royal jelly acid related products."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy of royal jelly in managing experimentally created MRONJ model in rats. METHODS: Sixty rats were randomly allocated into control, bisphosphonate (BP), royal jelly (RJ), Treatment, and Preventive groups. A defect was created in the alveolar socket following tooth extraction in the mandible as a surgical procedure in all groups. Before surgery, RJ was administered orally to the RJ group. Zoledronic acid was administered intraperitoneally to induce osteonecrosis in BP, treatment, and preventive group rats. Treatment group rats received RJ orally post-surgery, while preventive group rats received it pre-surgery. Histological and radiographic evaluations were performed post-study completion. RESULTS: Micro-CT examinations demonstrated significantly improved values in RJ-received groups (RJ, treatment, and preventive) compared to BP and control groups (p < 0.001). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed higher mean IL-1β and TNF-α levels in the BP group. The highest IL-1β difference was between BP and preventive groups (p < 0.001). TNF-α expression levels in all RJ-received groups were comparatively close to those of the control group. CONCLUSION: RJ enhances soft and hard tissue healing in MRONJ rat models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic or preventive agent in osteonecrosis management.",

      "abstract": "Royal jelly (RJ) has long been considered a crucial dietary component in dictating caste differentiation in honeybees. As a nutritional additive, royal jelly imparts a broad range of benefits to mammals and humans; however, its precise impact on the social hierarchy of these advanced animals is not yet fully understood. This study aims to determine whether the benefits of royal jelly can be transferred to rats to alter their social ranks and uncover the underlying mechanisms. A submissive model was established by inducing dysbiosis in rats, via the persistent exposure of vancomycin. Royal jelly at a dose of 2.5 g/kg was daily administered to the subject rats during postnatal weeks (PNW) 6 and 7. At the end of the intervention, animals were subjected to agonistic, water and tube competition tests, in order to assess their dominance status. As revealed by the results, the RJ treatment significantly improved the social rank of the dysbiotic rats, demonstrating that RJ can elicit positive effect on the social behaviors (caused by dysbiosis) of rats. All behavioral paradigms yielded consistent results, with no notable differences in body weight or anxiety levels. Regarding gut microbiome, vancomycin exposure caused the dysbiosis of the subject rats, which was partially reversed by treatment with royal jelly. Specifically, the intestinal presence of Proteobacteria was profoundly attenuated by the RJ supplementation, resulting in a comparable level with the intact/dominant rats. At the genus level, both Escherichia and Clostridium displayed similar dynamics in relation to Proteobacteria, implying their involvement with the RJ-mediated dominance switching. Transcriptomic analysis in the medial prefrontal context showed that the expression of a broad range of genes was influenced by RJ intake, embodying various pathways related to neuronal transmission such as neuroactive ligan-receptor interaction, the synaptic vesicle cycle, etc. By virtue of correlation analysis, Escherichia, Akkermansia and Clostridium were strongly associated with a set of gene modules around gastrin releasing peptide (Grp) and signaling pathways around Rps6ka3, establishing an intrinsic gut-brain communication. Furthermore, the infection trials of Escherichia significantly degraded the social ranks of the RJ-remedied rats in tube tests, while a series of cerebral genes like Grpr and Grpel1, as well as prefrontal spine density, were concordantly altered, underscoring the critical role of the gut-brain link in deciding the outcomes of the dyadic contests. In summary, this is an intriguing example of how royal jelly can influence the social ranks of mammals, emphasizing the importance of microbe-host interaction in mediating this species-spanning function of royal jelly in shaping social hierarchy."

      "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to investigate the proliferative or apoptotic effects of different doses and durations of Royal jelly (RJ) on serous type epithelial ovarian cancer, which is the most common epithelial ovarian cancer. For this purpose, cells of the Skov-3 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line were grown in McCoy medium and seeded in 6-well plates. RJ was prepared as a stock solution (1000 mg RJ/10 ml dH2O) and 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mg/ml RJ doses from the prepared stock solution were added to the medium for 24, 48, and 72 h incubated. After the treatment of RJ, the cell viability test (Tripan Blue), Ki-67 to determine the proliferative effect, cleaved-Caspase-3 and cleaved PARP expressions to determine its apoptotic effect were examined by immunocytochemical and immunofluorescence methods. In addition, findings were supported by the TUNEL method. As a result of the experiments, it was determined that 1 mg/ml and 24 h treatment of RJ did not affect cell proliferation and apoptosis, but generally, 50 mg/ml of RJ for 72 h inhibited proliferation in cancer cells and induced apoptosis. The use of royal jelly both monotherapeutically and in combination as an alternative treatment for ovarian cancer may provide the basis for new experimental protocols.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a clinical pathological syndrome characterized by steatosis and fat accumulation in liver parenchymal cells in patients without a history of excessive alcohol drinking. Currently, there is no definitive treatment for MASLD, and its prevalence increases with age and obesity, and after menopause. Among the ways to treat it, we can mention regular sports exercises and the use of natural supplements. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate and compare the effects of aerobic-resistance training with royal jelly supplementation on changes in paraoxonase 1, oxidized LDL, liver function, and lipid profile in postmenopausal women with Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease. Materials and Methods: This semi-experimental study involved 23 women with Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease with an average weight (71.34 ± 11.63 kg), age (48.54 ± 3.88 years), and body mass index (27.63 ± 4.20 kg/m2). They were randomly divided into two groups: exercise + supplement (n = 12) and exercise + placebo (n = 11). Both groups performed eight-station resistance exercises (8-12 repetitions in 2-4 sets) for 8 weeks, with three sessions per week (for 35-40 min, from 10-15 RPE), and then, for 10-15 min of active rest, they performed aerobic exercises with an intensity of 40-85% of the target heart rate, in two-minute intervals with 45 s of active rest. Royal jelly supplement (500 mg on training days, before each training session) was consumed. Blood sampling was done before and 48 h after the last training session. Statistical analysis was performed using a variance test with repeated measures (two groups × two stages of pre-test-post-test) in SPSS software (Version 26) with a significance level of p < 0.05. Results: The results of the statistical analysis show that the effects of eight weeks of exercise + supplement and exercise + placebo on PON1, oxLDL, lipid profiles (HDL, LDL, TC, and TG), and liver enzymes (ALT, AST) in women with non-alcoholic fatty liver showed a significant difference (p < 0.05). The results show a significant increase in PON1 (p = 0.008) and HDL (p = 0.005) in the exercise + supplement group compared to the exercise + placebo group. But significant decreases in oxLDL (p = 0.031), TC (p = 0.045), TG (p = 0.013), LDL (p = 0.027), ALT (p = 0.015) and AST (p = 0.009) were observed in the exercise + supplement group compared to the exercise + placebo group (<0.05). The results show a significant increase in PON1 (p = 0.008) and HDL (p = 0.005) in the exercise + supplement group compared to the exercise + placebo group. However, significant decreases in oxLDL (p = 0.031), TC (p = 0.045), TG (p = 0.013), LDL (p = 0.027), ALT (p = 0.015), and AST (p = 0.009) was observed in the exercise + supplement group compared to the exercise + placebo group. Conclusions: Based on the results, it can be concluded that aerobic-resistance exercises with the addition of royal jelly can probably be an efficient and recommended strategy to minimize the harmful effects of Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease by affecting the activity of liver enzymes, paraoxonase 1, LDL oxidation, and lipid profile. Although exercise alone also yielded favorable results, according to the findings of this research, it can be said that exercise, combined with the use of royal jelly supplements, may have more positive effects on reducing liver complications and improving body function. However, in order to obtain more accurate scientific evidence, it is necessary to investigate more doses and timing of royal jelly in future studies.",

This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of royal jelly (RJ) in improving exercise performance in endurance-trained men. METHODS: In this randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we will enroll 18 male endurance athletes. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the intervention condition, which will receive royal jelly (RJ) in 500 mg capsules taken orally twice daily for 2 weeks, or the control condition, which will receive a placebo consisting of 500 mg starch capsules taken orally twice daily for the same duration. The study will utilize a 2 × 2 crossover design with a 2-week washout period between treatments. To evaluate aerobic performance, we will determine each participant's maximal aerobic speed (MAS), followed by a test conducted at 80% of the MAS to measure time to exhaustion. Blood samples (5 cc) will be collected from all participants before and after the treadmill tests to analyze mRNA expressions of Nrf2 and PGC-1α, as well as oxidative stress parameters. Additionally, participants' dietary intake will be assessed using 3-day food records, and their blood pressure will be monitored before exercise, immediately after, and half an hour post-exercise. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of RJ as a nutraceutical agent for enhancing endurance athletic performance. We anticipate that the results will provide new insights into the clinical and molecular benefits of RJ. Additionally, these findings will offer valuable data to guide the design and execution of future clinical research involving RJ. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (registration No. IRCT20231209060310N1, date: December 21, 2023).",

Due to their metastatic properties, they complicate the treatment process and pose a great threat to human health. These aggressive types of cancer are resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Therefore, it is extremely important to investigate the therapeutic effects of natural compounds. In our previous study, effective doses of Royal Jelly (RJ) (100 mg/mL) and Aloe vera (AVE) (20 µg/mL) were determined and tested separately and in combination on lung and colorectal cancer cells. Glycolytic capacities were determined using the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer, total transcriptome profiles were sequenced using NovaSeq 6000, and BAX and BCL-2 gene levels were determined using RT-qPCR. It was seen that RJ and RJ + AVE affected glycolytic capacity and more genes in lung cancer cells. In HT29, AVE alone was seen to reduce glycolytic capacity and RJ + AVE combination was seen to reduce the expression level of genes related to cell proliferation and cycle. After RJ + AVE treatments, the apoptotic process which is triggered via MAPK pathway was found in lung cancer. Moreover, BAX levels increased and BCL-2 levels decreased both lung and colorectal cancer cells. It was observed that the combination of RJ and AVE affected the glycolysis process, cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis on lung and colorectal cancer. In particular, the combination of RJ + AVE was found to be more effective on lung cancer.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Several nutraceuticals, food, and cosmetic products can be developed using royal jelly. It is known for its potential health benefits, including its ability to boost the immune system and reduce inflammation. It is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which can improve general health. Royal jelly (RJ) is also being studied as a potential therapeutic agent for cancer and other chronic diseases. It is effective in reducing tumor growth and stimulating immunity. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effects of royal jelly on cancerous A549 cells and healthy MRC-5 cells at various doses ranging from 1.25 to 10 mg/ml. Royal jelly's anti-proliferative effect was evaluated by MTT and SRB assay for 48 h. The induction of necrosis and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry as well. The relative amounts of major molecules in Royal jelly were determined by FTIR spectroscopy to identify key functional groups and molecular structures. In addition, this technique was used for the first time to detect changes in the macromolecular composition of lung cells treated with royal jelly. Thus, it provided insights into the relative abundance of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, which could correlate with their bioactive properties. RESULTS: The antiproliferative effect of Royal jelly was found to be selective on A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 9.26 mg/mL, with no cytotoxic effects on normal MRC-5 cells. Moreover, Royal jelly induced predominantly necrotic cell death in A549 cells, %39.10 at 4 mg/ml and %57.88 at 10 mg/ml concentrations. However, the necrosis rate in MRC-5 cells was quite low, at 9.16% and 20.44% at the same doses. Royal jelly showed dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity toward A549 cells, whereas it exhibited no apparent cytotoxicity in MRC-5 cells. In order to identify the biomolecular changes induced by royal jelly, we used two unsupervised chemometric pattern recognition algorithms (PCA and HCA) on the preprocessed sample FTIR spectra to determine the effects of royal jelly on cell biochemistry. According to PCA and HCA results, RJ treatments especially affected biomolecules in A549 cells. The total spectral band variances in the PCA loading spectra were calculated for understanding biomolecular alterations. These plots revealed profound changes in the lipid, protein, and nucleic acid content of RJ-applied lung cells, primarily identifying RJ and H2O2 treated groups for A549 cells. CONCLUSION: Ultimately, the selective cytotoxicity of royal jelly toward A549 cancerous cells suggests that royal jelly may be a promising therapeutic agent for identifying innovative lung cancer treatment strategies. Additionally, understanding the molecular alterations induced by royal jelly could guide the development of novel cancer treatments that exploit its bioactive properties. This could lead to more effective and safer therapies."

      "abstract": "Queen bee larva (QBL), as a by-product of royal jelly, is a kind of protein-rich edible insect. However, the development and utilization of QBL have been very limited for an extended period, resulting in considerable economic waste. Notably, QBL has substantial potential for anti-aging treatments; however, systematic studies have been scarce. The present study aimed to analyze the effects of freeze-dried QBL powder (QBLP) treatment in a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced-aging mouse and to explore the mechanisms. A behavioral test indicated that QBLP-treated mice had improved cognitive function and memory decline caused by aging compared to untreated aged mice. Furthermore, QBLP treatment improved organ index in aged mice and prevented pathological damage to the brain tissue. Concomitantly, treatment of D-gal-induced-aging mice with QBLP significantly reduced the oxidative damage of serum and increased the skin moisture content of aging mice. Finally, integrated analyses of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolome showed that QBLP supplementation altered the composition of the gut microbiota, enriched biochemical pathways associated with amino acid metabolism, and adjusted serum concentrations of beneficial free amino acids. Overall, QBLP can improve symptoms related to D-gal-induced aging in mice by regulating gut microbiota structure and amino acid metabolism."

      "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, commonly causes hospital-acquired pneumonia. Royal jelly fatty acids (RJFAs), a mixture of various fatty acids extracted from royal jelly, exhibit antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties in treating many infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the therapeutic mechanisms of RJFAs in treatment of acute P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection are still unclear. Herein, we initially extracted the fatty acids from royal jelly and characterized their chemical constituents using headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, we examined the antibacterial effect of RJFAs in vitro and explored its therapeutic effect and molecular mechanisms in treating acute P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection in vivo. The in vitro antibacterial studies revealed that RJFAs significantly inhibited P. aeruginosa growth. Moreover, the in vivo studies showed that the RJFAs effectively mitigated the lung damage and inflammation induced by P. aeruginosa through impairing neutrophil infiltration, reducing the bacterial load in lung and diminishing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin (IL-1β), IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). In addition, the mice treated with RJFAs exhibited reduced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), c-Jun, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in the lung tissues in comparison with that of the mice without drug treatment. These findings demonstrated that RJFAs exhibited significant antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects in treating the P. aeruginosa-induced acute pneumonia, and the anti-inflammatory effects were exerted through suppressing the mitogen-activated protein kinase/activator protein-1 (MAPK/AP-1) pathway and NF-κB activation, suggesting a promising therapeutic potential of RJFAs against acute bacterial pneumonia.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In recent years, microplastics (MPs), which are novel environmental contaminants measuring 5 mm in diameter, have garnered considerable attention. However, information regarding substances that can mitigate the dangers of MPs for animals remains extremely limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety days were devoted to the exposure of mature male mice to royal jelly (RJ) and 2 µm virgin polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) in this study. Pre-implantation embryo development; the structure of testis tissue; the gonadosomatic index; sperm parameters; RNA damage in germinal cells; the anti-oxidant capacity of the entire testis; and the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes in serum and testicular tissue, including TAC, SOD dismutase, CAT, GSH, and MDA, histomorphometric indices of the testis (tubular differentiation index, spermatogenesis index, and repopulation index), steroidogenic foci, and the quantity of apoptosis were assessed in the testis, respectively, through the measurement of pro-apoptosis (p53, Bax, and Caspase-3) and anti-apoptosis (Bcl-2) factors, as well as Hsp70 mediator. RESULTS: The results indicate that concurrent administration of RJ can confer a protective effect on mice exposed to microplastics by maintaining the structure of mitochondria and enhancement of the anti-oxidant defense system. Furthermore, RJ co-treatment decreased apoptosis and oxidant/anti-oxidant status, enhanced pre-implantation embryo development, and improved sperm characteristics and RNA damage in germ cells. CONCLUSION: The data confirm that royal jelly could protect the testis structure against polystyrene microplastic-induced testicular injury through anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties."

Royal Jelly (RJ) and tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) are suggested to promote obesity and its related problems through potential mutual mechanistic pathways. This investigation intended to evaluate the glycemic and inflammation-promoting effects of RJ, TRF, and their combinations to evaluate their synergic effects through irisin action in obese rats induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) that underwent a calorie restriction diet (CRD). Fifty HFD-fed obese rats received the following interventions: RJ, TRF, or RJ + TRF in combination with a CRD for eight consecutive weeks. After the investigation, body weight, fasting blood sugar (FBS), irisin, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), leptin, adiponectin, and insulin resistance (IR) were assessed. After 8 weeks of treatment, significant weight reduction was noticed in rats that received RJ and RJ + TRF related to the CRD rats (p < .001), although this reduction was not considerable in TRF-treated rats. RJ and RJ + TRF supplementation markedly elevated irisin concentrations in CRD rats (p < .05), but TRF did not. Glycemic indices, inflammatory indices including IL-1β and CRP levels, and leptin concentrations were significantly decreased after RJ, TRF, and their combinations were added to CRD (p < .05). According to the mediational analysis results, irisin mediated the promoting effects of RJ on glycemic hemostasis. Based on the results of this investigation, RJ and TRF are novel nutrients that have the potential to improve obesity-related disorders. This research suggests that RJ exerts its beneficial glycemic regulatory effects through irisin."

      "abstract": "Hepatic fibrosis is a global health burden that accounts for high mortality. No definitive therapy to suppress the fibrosis so far. Thus, looking for an effective remedy to address the unmet medical need is crucial. We aimed to scrutinize the efficacy of royal jelly (RJ) and/or α-Bisabolol (BISA) in the regression of fibrosis provoked by thioacetamide (TAA), focusing on their action on redox status, NF-κBp65, apoptosis, and TGF-β1/FAK/α-SMA pathway. TAA was injected intraperitoneally twice weekly to trigger hepatic fibrosis. Rats were gavaged with RJ (100 mg/kg) and/or BISA (50 mg/kg) daily for 8 weeks. The findings elucidated that RJ and/or BISA alleviated TAA-provoked fibrosis mirrored by the improvement of hepatotoxicity serum indices, abolishing oxidative stress, and repair the morphological alterations. Additionally, RJ and BISA suppressed the hepatic inflammation induced by TAA through downregulating NF-κBp65 expression, reducing TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations, and elevating IL-10 level. Their anti-fibrotic effect was emphasized from the decline in FAK, Smad3, COL-III, hydroxyproline levels, and TGF-β1, α-SMA immunoexpression. BISA displayed better ameliorative action than RJ. Conclusively, RJ and/or BISA possess a hepatoprotective activity against TAA-mediated fibrosis by enhancing antioxidant defense, inhibiting NF-κBp65, and modulating TGF-β1/FAK/α-SMA signaling. RJ and BISA might be prospective candidates to combat hepatic fibrosis.",

In addition, it examined whether this effect is AMPK-dependent. Methods: Five groups of adult male albino rats were used (n = 6 each as 1); the control rats were fed with a normal diet (2.9 kcal), and the other groups were as follows: control + RJ (300 mg/kg), HFD (4.75 kcal), HFD + RJ (300 mg/kg), and HFD + RJ (300 mg/kg) + dorsomorphin (an AMPK inhibitor) (0.2 mg/kg). Results: RJ was administered orally to all rats. With no changes in food and energy intake, RJ significantly reduced gains in body weight, fat weight, body mass index (BMI), the Lee index, abdominal circumference (AC), and the adiposity index (AI). It also reduced fasting glucose and insulin levels, HOMA-IR, and the circulatory levels of free fatty acids (FFAs), triglycerides, cholesterol, and LDL-c in the HFD-fed rats. RJ also increased serum glycerol levels and adiponectin levels, but reduced the serum levels of leptin, IL-6, and TNF-α. Moreover, RJ reduced the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α from isolated WAT. At the tissue level, the HFD + RJ rats exhibited a smaller adipocyte size compared to the HFD rats. At the molecular level, RJ increased the phosphorylation of AMPK, SREBP1, and ACC-1 and increased the mRNA and protein levels of HSL and ATG in the WAT of the HFD rats. In concomitance, RJ increased the mRNA levels of PGC-α1, reduced the protein levels of PPARγ, and repressed the transcriptional activities of PPARγ, SREBP1, and C/EBPαβ in the WAT of these rats. All the aforementioned effects of RJ were prevented by co-treatment with dorsomorphin. Conclusions: RJ exerts a potent anti-obesity effect in rats that is mediated by the AMPk-dependent suppression of WAT adipogenesis and the stimulation of lipolysis.",

This systematic review aims to synthesize current research on the health benefits, bioactive components, and mechanisms of action of RJ. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on studies published from 2000 to 2024 (April). Findings indicate that RJ exhibits a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-aging effects. Beneficial biological properties of RJ might be due to the presence of flavonoids proteins, peptides, fatty acids. Both preclinical and clinical studies have reported that RJ improves the immune function such as wound healing, and also decreases the severity of chronic diseases including diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects involve modulation of signalling pathways such as NF-κB, MAPK, and AMPK. Despite promising results, the review identifies several gaps in the current knowledge, including the need for standardized dosing regimens and long-term safety assessments. Furthermore, variations in RJ composition due to geographic and botanical factors necessitate more rigorous quality control measures. This review underscores the potential of RJ as a multifunctional therapeutic agent and highlights the necessity for further well designed studies to fully elucidate its health benefits and optimize its use as a functional food supplement."

      "abstract": "A differential diet with royal jelly (RJ) during early larval development in honeybees shapes the phenotype, which is probably mediated by epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Evidence indicates that small molecules in RJ can modulate gene expression in mammalian cells, such as the fatty acid 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), previously associated with the inhibition of histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs). Therefore, we combined computational (molecular docking simulations) and experimental approaches for the screening of potential HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) among 32 RJ-derived fatty acids. Biochemical assays and gene expression analyses (Reverse Transcriptase - quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) were performed to evaluate the functional effects of the major RJ fatty acids, 10-HDA and 10-HDAA (10-hydroxy-decanoic acid), in two human cancer cell lines (HCT116 and MDA-MB-231). The molecular docking simulations indicate that these fatty acids might interact with class I HDACs, specifically with the catalytic domain of human HDAC2, likewise well-known HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) such as SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) and TSA (Trichostatin A). In addition, the combined treatment with 10-HDA and 10-HDAA inhibits the activity of human nuclear HDACs and leads to a slight increase in the expression of HDAC-coding genes in cancer cells. Our findings indicate that royal jelly fatty acids collectively contribute to HDAC inhibition and that 10-HDA and 10-HDAA are weak HDACi that facilitate the acetylation of lysine residues of chromatin, triggering an increase in gene expression levels in cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Bee-derived pharmaceutical products, including propolis (PRO) and royal jelly (ROJ), possess outstanding pharmacological properties. However, their efficiency in counteracting the deleterious influences of cadmium (Cd) in testes and the relevant mechanisms entail further investigations. Therefore, this study sheds light on the therapeutic efficacy of PRO and ROJ against testicular dysfunction and infertility induced by Cd. Toward this end, 30 mature male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into six groups (5 animals/group), including (I) control, (II) Cd, (III) PRO, (IV) ROJ, (V) PRO + Cd, and (VI) ROJ + Cd groups. Furthermore, antioxidant factors, semen quality, hormonal levels, steroidogenic enzymes, and genotoxicity were assessed. Moreover, histopathological and ultrastructural attributes and offspring rates were investigated. The Cd-treated group revealed marked reductions in reduced glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) with an amplification of lipid peroxidation in testes, indicating disruption of the antioxidant defense system. Furthermore, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and DNA damage were significantly heightened, implying inflammation and genotoxicity, respectively. Moreover, steroidogenic enzymes, including 17β-Hydroxy Steroid Dehydrogenase 3 (HSD17b3), 3β-Hydroxy Steroid Dehydrogenase 2 (HSD3b2), 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), and steroid 5α-reductase 2 (SRD5A2) were markedly diminished accompanied with disorders in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone. Besides, spermatozoa quality was reduced, associated with a diminution in the diameter of seminiferous tubules. By contrast, PRO or ROJ significantly protected and/or counteracted the Cd-induced pathophysiological consequences, ameliorating antioxidant and inflammatory biomarkers, steroidogenic enzymes, hormonal levels, and sperm properties, along with lessening DNA impairments. Critically, histological and ultrastructural analyses manifested several anomalies in the testicular tissues of the Cd-administered group, including the Leydig and Sertoli cells and spermatozoa. Conversely, PRO or ROJ sustained testicular tissues' structure, enhancing spermatozoa integrity and productivity. Interestingly, treatment with PRO or ROJ improved fertility indices through offspring rates compared to the Cd-animal group. Our data suggest that PRO is a more effective countermeasure than ROJ against Cd toxicity for securing the delicate testicular microenvironment for spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis.",

Despite its well-known broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, the precise molecular mechanism underlying its antibacterial action has remained elusive. In this study, we investigated the impact of RJ on the bacteria model MG1655 at its half-maximal inhibitory concentration, employing LC-MS/MS to analyze proteomic changes. The differentially expressed proteins were found to primarily contribute to the suppression of gene expression processes, specifically transcription and translation, disrupting nutrition and energy metabolism, and inducing oxidative stress. Notably, RJ treatment led to a marked inhibition of superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, resulting in heightened oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, through a protein-protein interaction network analysis using the STRING database, we identified CRP and IHF as crucial host regulators responsive to RJ. These regulators were found to play a pivotal role in suppressing essential hub genes associated with energy production and antioxidant capabilities. Our findings significantly contribute to the understanding of RJ's antibacterial mechanism, highlighting its potential as a natural alternative to conventional antibiotics. The identification of CRP and IHF as central players highlights the intricate regulatory networks involved in RJ's action, offering new targets for developing innovative antimicrobial strategies.",

Hence, the demand to find more usable drugs is evident. Synthesis and development of natural, effective, biocompatible, and harmless compounds against Leishmania major is the principal priority of this study. METHODS: By electrospinning method, a new type of nanofiber were synthesized from royal jelly and propolis with different ratios. Nanofibers were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Contact angle, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), Half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) for different concentrations of nanofibers were determined using quantitative calorimetric methods. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and flow cytometry were performed as complementary tests. RESULTS: The results showed that the proposed formulas provide a new achievement that, despite the significant killing activity on L. major, has negligible cytotoxicity on the host cells. Royal jelly nanofibers have significantly shown the best 72 hours results (IC50= 35 μg/ml and EC50=16.4 μg/ml) and the least cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: This study presents a great challenge to introduce a new low-cost treatment method for CL, accelerate wound healing, and reduce scarring with minimal side effects and biocompatible materials. Royal jelly and propolis nanofibers significantly inhibit the growth of L. major in-vitro."

Potential use of royal jelly (RJ), folic acid (FA) and 5-azacitidine (5-AZA) on two Egyptian faba bean varieties (Sakha-3 and Giza-716) grown under saline conditions was investigated. Salinity stress affects negatively on seeds germination (G %), mitotic index, membrane stability and induced a significant increase in chromosomal abnormalities (CAs). DNA methyltransferases genes (MT1 and MT2) were highly up-regulated (∼23 and 8 folds for MT1 and MT2 in shoots of Giza-716 stressed plants). On the other hand, down regulation of other studied stress related genes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), heat shock protein (HSP-17.9) and proline-rich protein (GPRP) were detected in stressed plants of both studied varieties. Treating plants with RJ and FA increase G%, chlorophyll content, improves membrane properties and reduces CAs compared to non-treated stressed plants. Exogenous application of 5-AZA, RJ and FA on salinity stressed plants was associated with a significant reduction in the transcription of MT1 and MT2 which was associated with significant up regulation in the expression of Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT, GR, GPRP and HSP-17.9 encoding genes. The Lowest expression of MT1 and MT2 were induced with 5-AZA treatment in both studied varieties. Exogenous application of the FA, RJ and 5-AZA modified the methylation state of stressed plants by regulation the expression of DNA methyltransferases, subsequently, modulated the expression of studied genes and could be proposed as a promising treatment to ameliorate hazardous effects of salt stress on different plants."

However, the systematic relationship between high pressure processing conditions and protein deaggregation has not been sufficiently investigated. Major royal jelly proteins, which are naturally highly fibrillar aggregates, and it was found that the pressure level and exposure time could significantly promote protein deaggregation. The 100-200 MPa treatment favoured the deaggregation of proteins with a significant decrease in the sulfhydryl group content. Contrarily, at higher pressure levels (>400 MPa), the exposure time promoted the formation of disordered agglomerates. Notably, the inter-conversion of α-helix and β-strands in major royal jelly proteins after high pressure processing eliminates the solvent-free cavities inside the aggregates, which exerts a 'collapsing' effect on the fibrillar aggregates. Furthermore, the first machine learning model of the high pressure processing conditions and the protein deaggregation behaviour was developed, which provided digital guidance for protein aggregation regulation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women which can be cured in most individuals with early-stage non-metastatic disease. Imbalance in estrogen signaling pathways and propagating levels of estrogens has important roles in breast cancer development. Targeting the estrogen receptor signaling pathway is linked to breast cancer treatment. Royal jelly is one of the bee products containing 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid, a structure similar to mammalian estrogen, allowing it to attach to estrogen receptors. It is considered as a general tonic and immunomodulator which may be helpful in reducing the side effects of cancer treatments. Currently, there are controversial data regarding the pros and cons of royal jelly in cancer. Here we provide an overview of the effects of royal jelly on sex hormones and its possible role in breast cancer. METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched with the search terms royal jelly, cancer, and sexual hormones. All preclinical and clinical studies regarding the hormonal effects of royal jelly were included. RESULTS: According to the collected preclinical data, consumption of royal jelly at daily doses below 200 mg/kg can be useful to decrease the risk of breast cancer since it reduces the serum level of estrogen; whereas increases progesterone, which subsequently decreases the expression of ERs on the ER-positive cells. CONCLUSION: Future clinical studies are essential to confirm the safe dose of royal jelly as an adjuvant therapy in breast cancer.",

There are several sources for royal jelly and one of them is Indian Royal Jelly (IRJ). However, the neuroprotective actions of IRJ and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are not well known. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of IRJ in the okadaic acid (OKA)-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) model in rats. METHODS: In male Wistar rats, OKA was intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered, and from day 7, they were treated orally with IRJ or memantine for 21 days. Spatial and recognition learning and memory were evaluated from days 27-34; employing the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object recognition tests (NORT), respectively. In vitro biochemical measurements were taken of the cholinergic system and oxidative stress markers. In silico docking was used to find the role of tau protein kinase and phosphatase in the pharmacological action. RESULTS: In OKA-induced rats, IRJ decreased the escape latency and path length in MWM and increased the exploration time for novel objects and the discrimination index in NORT. ICV-OKA rats had higher free radicals and cytokines that caused inflammation and their level of free radical scavengers was back to normal with IRJ treatment. IRJ increased the level of acetylcholine and inhibited acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, the in silico docking study revealed the strong binding affinity of 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), a bioactive constituent of IR, to the tau protein kinases and phosphatases. CONCLUSION: IRJ may serve as a nootropic agent in the treatment of dementia, and owing to its capacity to prevent oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and increase cholinergic tone; it has the potential to be explored as a novel strategy for the treatment of dementia and AD. More studies may be needed to develop 10-HDA as a novel drug entity for AD."

METHODS: Male rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) to induce ischemic stroke and were supplemented daily with either vehicle (control group), RJ or 10-HDA for 7 days starting on the day of surgery. On the eighth day, rats were sacrificed and brain tissue and blood samples were obtained to analyze brain infarct volume, DNA damage as well as apoptotic, inflammatory and epigenetic parameters. RESULTS: Both RJ and 10-HDA supplementation significantly reduced brain infarction and decreased weight loss when compared to control animals. These effects were associated with reduced levels of active caspase-3 and PARP-1 and increased levels of acetyl-histone H3 and H4. Although both RJ and 10-HDA treatments significantly increased acetyl-histone H3 levels, the effect of RJ was more potent than that of 10-HDA. RJ and 10-HDA supplementation also alleviated DNA damage by significantly reducing tail length, tail intensity and tail moment in brain tissue and peripheral lymphocytes, except for the RJ treatment which tended to reduce tail moment in lymphocytes without statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that neuroprotective effects of RJ in experimental stroke can mostly be attributed to 10-HDA.",

      "abstract": "A natural aging mouse model can exhibit physiological characteristics that closely resemble those of human aging. Through long-term observation, it reflects the occurrence and development of the aging process more accurately. Although numerous beneficial effects of royal jelly (RJ) have been extensively demonstrated in multiple experimental models, the effects of RJ on naturally aging mice have not yet been investigated. In this study, middle-aged male C57BL/6J mice were given RJ for 9 consecutive months to investigate its impact on the intestinal barrier function, gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) content and possible mechanisms. The results confirmed that RJ modulated serum lipids by reducing the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Additionally, it protected the liver by increasing antioxidant enzyme levels while decreasing inflammatory cytokines TNF-α (by 51.97%), IL-6 (by 29.73%), and IL-1β (by 43.89%). Furthermore, RJ inhibited the expression of cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitors including p16, p21, and p53. Importantly, RJ ameliorated gut dysfunctions by inhibiting reduction of tight junction proteins and reducing inflammatory cytokines content in the colon. We also observed an alteration in gut microbiota characterized by an elevated ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroides (F/B) along with increased abundance of beneficial bacteria, i.e., Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 and Akkermansia. Correlation analysis revealed positive associations between most bacterial genera and SCFAs production. Functional profiling of gut microbiota composition indicated that RJ intervention regulated amino acid metabolism, glycan biosynthesis, and cofactor/vitamin metabolism. Overall, our findings provide an effective dietary intervention strategy for modulating age-associated frailty through the modulation of the gut microbiota.",

C2C12 cells have an innate ability to differentiate into myogenic cells. Like MSCs, C2C12 cells can also differentiate into osteoblast- and adipocyte-lineage cells. We recently reported that RJ enhances the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. However, the effect of RJ on osteoblast or adipocyte differentiation is still unknown. Here in this study, we have examined the effect of RJ on the osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation of C2C12 cells. Protease-treated RJ was used to reduce the adverse effects caused by RJ supplementation. To induce osteoblast or adipocyte differentiation, cells were treated with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist, respectively. RNA-seq was used to analyze the effect of RJ on gene expression. We found that RJ stimulates osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation. RJ regulated 279 genes. RJ treatment upregulated glutathione-related genes. Glutathione, the most abundant antioxidative factor in cells, has been shown to promote osteoblast differentiation in MSC and MSC-like cells. Therefore, RJ may promote osteogenesis, at least in part, through the antioxidant effects of glutathione. RJ enhances the differentiation ability of C2C12 cells into multiple lineages, including myoblasts, osteoblasts, and adipocytes.",

It is widely used for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effect of long-term administration of celecoxib on kidney of male albino rats, and to study the potential effect of treatment discontinuation on such tissues. The study also examined the alleged ameliorative effect of royal jelly (RJ). METHODS: Fifty, male albino rats were divided into 5 equal groups; 10 each. Group 1: rats received no drug (control group). Group 2: rats received celecoxib (50 mg/kg/day, orally for 30 successive days). Group 3: rats received celecoxib (50 mg/kg/day, orally) and royal jelly (300 mg/kg/day, orally) for 30 successive days. Group 4: rats received celecoxib for 30 successive days, then rats were left untreated for another 30 days. Group 5: rats received celecoxib and RJ for 30 successive days, then rats were left untreated for another 30 days. RESULTS: Long-term celecoxib administration caused significant elevation in kidney function tests, with ameliorative effects of RJ against celecoxib-induced renal toxicity. CONCLUSION: Long-term celecoxib administration caused renal toxicity in male albino rats, with ameliorative effects of RJ."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of royal jelly and fermented soy extracts on menopausal symptoms and on quality of life in pre- and post-menopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This prospective observational study was carried out in a Clinical Hospital of Brasov, Romania, during June 2020 and December 2021. Eighty pre- and post-menopausal women, aged between 45 and 60 years, were included in two groups. The first group (40 women) received a dietary supplement with fermented soy extract twice a day for eight weeks and the second group (40 women) received the same dietary supplement with fermented soy extracts and 1500 mg of royal jelly capsules for eight weeks. After the treatment, the MENQOL score, DASS-21 score, and the mean number and intensity of daily hot flushes were recorded and compared with baseline values. RESULTS: After eight weeks of treatment, the score of the MENQOL questionnaire and all its domains' scores decreased in comparison with the baseline in both groups (p < 0.001). Also, the DASS-21 score (p < 0.001), depression score (p < 0.001), anxiety score (p < 0.001), and stress score (p < 0.001) improved. The mean number and the intensity of hot flushes decreased in both groups (p < 0.001). Comparing these variables after the treatment in both groups, we observed that the women who received dietary supplements with fermented soy extracts and royal jelly capsules recorded better scores for MENQOL (vasomotor, physical, and psychosocial domains) and a more reduced mean number of daily hot flushes. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study suggests that both dietary fermented soy supplements and royal jelly capsules possess beneficial effects against menopausal symptoms, increase the quality of life in pre- and post-menopausal women, and that the effects might be significantly improved if those dietary supplements are administered in association.",

Relatively safe and easy acquisition of nutraceutical natural products make them suitable candidates for anticancer research. Royal jelly (RJ), a superfood, has many biological and pharmacological activities. This study was conducted to, for the first time, elucidate its anticancer efficiency, even in high doses, on neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines through cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle and biomolecular content evaluation. We performed experiments with RJ concentrations in the range of 1.25-10 mg mL-1 for 48 h. Cell viability assays revealed a notable cytotoxic effect of RJ in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with a high dose of RJ significantly increased the apoptotic cell population of both cell lines. Furthermore, we observed G0-G1 phase arrest in neuroblastoma cells but G2-M arrest in glioblastoma cells. All these cellular changes are closely associated with the alterations of the macromolecular makeup of the cells, such as decreased saturated lipid, protein, DNA and RNA amounts, protein conformational changes, decreased protein phosphorylation and increased protein carbonylation. These cellular changes are associated with RJ triggered-ROS formation. The clear segregation between the control and the RJ-treated groups proved these changes, obtained from the unsupervised and supervised chemometric analysis. RJ has good anticancer activity against nervous system cancers and could be safely used with current treatment strategies.",

Addressing these disorders is crucial, as conventional drugs often come with high costs and adverse effects. This review explores the potential of royal jelly (RJ), a natural bee product rich in bioactive components, as an alternative strategy for managing metabolic diseases. RJ exhibits diverse therapeutic properties, including antimicrobial, estrogen-like, anti-inflammatory, hypotensive, anticancer, and antioxidant effects. This review's focus is on investigating how RJ and its components impact conditions like diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and gastrointestinal illnesses. Evidence suggests that RJ serves as a complementary treatment for various health issues, notably demonstrating cholesterol- and glucose-lowering effects in diabetic rats. Specific RJ-derived metabolites, such as 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), also known as the \"Queen bee acid,\" show promise in reducing insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Recent research highlights RJ's role in modulating immune responses, enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines, and suppressing key inflammatory mediators. Despite these promising findings, further research is needed to comprehensively understand the mechanisms underlying RJ's therapeutic effects.",

To address this knowledge gap, this randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out to determine the effects of RJ consumption on post-stroke clinical outcomes. METHODS: Of 64 eligible ischemic stroke patients (45-80 years), 32 were randomized to the RJ and 32 to the placebo groups and completed a 12-week intervention. The intervention group was advised to receive 1,000 mg of RJ dragee daily after breakfast. Post-stroke complications including cognition, fatigue, mental health, and appetite, along with serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) were assessed in groups pre-and post-intervention. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of RJ consumption, cognitive function [adjusted mean difference, 4.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.75 to 7.67], serum levels of BDNF (adjusted mean difference, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.67), stress (adjusted mean difference, -3.33; 95% CI, -6.50 to -0.17), and appetite (adjusted mean difference, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.19 to 2.56) were significantly improved. However, the findings for fatigue (adjusted mean difference, -4.32; 95% CI, -10.28 to 1.63), depression (adjusted mean difference, -1.71; 95% CI, -5.58 to 2.16), anxiety (adjusted mean difference, -2.50; 95% CI, -5.50 to 0.49), and MUAC (adjusted mean difference, 0.36; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.84) were less favorable. CONCLUSION: Findings support the benefits of RJ consumption in improving post-stroke complications and clinical outcomes.Clinical trial registration: https://www.irct.ir/trial/59275, Identifier IRCT20180818040827N4."

In all cases we validated the method in terms of selectivity, limits of detection (0.1-2.8 μg kg-1) and quantification (0.3-9.2 μg kg-1), linearity, matrix effect (<±20 %), trueness (recoveries between 93 % and 118 %), and precision (relative standard deviation < 11 %). All royal jelly liquid dietary supplements were positive for chlorfenvinphos and, in the case of one of them, for α-endosulfan; chlorfenvinphos was determined in some fresh royal jelly samples, and no pesticide residues were detected in the propolis samples analysed.",

      "abstract": "Pesticides can easily enter the food chain, harming bee populations and ecosystems. Exposure of beehive products to various contaminants has been identified as one of the factors contributing to the decline in bee populations, and multiple food alerts have been reported. Despite this fact, royal jelly, a valuable bee product with nutritional and functional properties, has received less attention in this context. Pesticide residues of different chemical class can contaminate royal jelly when foraging bees collect pollen or nectar from pesticide-treated flowers, or in some cases, due to its frequent and inappropriate use in the treatment of mites in beehives. To monitor this issue and also make it more reliable, it is crucial to develop effective sample preparation methods for extracting pesticides from royal jelly for subsequent analysis. In this context, this review provides information about sample preparation methods (solid-phase extraction, solvent extraction, and QuEChERS-quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) and analytical methods that have been validated or improved to extract and analyze pesticides, respectively, in royal jelly samples of different origins. Finally, future perspectives are discussed. With this background, we aim to provide data that can guide future research related to this topic."

MSCs have extensive clinical applications in regeneration, functional reconstruction and cellular therapies. However, studies are needed to discover ways to improve the properties of MSCs, such as differentiation, and prevent senescence in culture, which are both very important for cell therapies. Royal jelly (RJ) is a nutritional substance produced by worker bees that contains a substantial amounts of proteins that are beneficial for cell growth and proliferation. RJ is widely used in traditional medicine today, and due to the specific components in its content, it has been reported to have antioxidant, antiproliferative, antimicrobial, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-ageing properties. In our study, human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) derived from umbilical cord matrix were grown in culture medium supplemented with RJ. The control group comprised minimum essential medium (MEM) and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS); RJ groups were formed using MEM, 10% FBS and 0.075 mg/ml or 0.150 mg/ml RJ. In our study, we evaluated the effect of RJ on WJ-MSC growth by MTT assay, proliferating cell nuclear antigen ELISA, β-galactosidase activity assay, MitoTracker Green staining and differentiation tests in adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic cell lines. It was observed that the number of mitochondria increased, senescence decreased and osteogenic differentiation increased after differentiation induction after the addition of RJ to MSC culture. In general, the results of this study indicate that WJ-MSCs enhance mitochondrial numbers and important cellular activities, such as antisenescence and osteogenic differentiation, and with increasing evidence from further studies, RJ supplementation may be found beneficial for the use of MSCs in bone engineering regenerative medicine or cell therapy.",

We investigated the therapeutic potency of combined protein fraction (PF50) of major RJ protein 2 and its isoform X1 on bleomycin (Bleo)-induced pulmonary injury in rats. Our study examined the impact of PF50 on pulmonary oxidative and inflammatory stress as well as smooth muscle alpha-actin (α-SMA). In addition, the predicted impacts of this PF on the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)- 8 and 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and the E-type prostanoid 2 (EP2) and IL-13 α2 subunit (IL13α2R) receptors, were evaluated using molecular docking. The results showed that PF50 reduced pulmonary inflammatory cells and their secreted pro-inflammatory mediators, including NF-κB, IKK, IL-4, IL-6, and NO. Additionally, the levels of IgE and mucin were diminished after treatment with PF50. Moreover, PF50 treatment improved pulmonary oxidative stress indices such as lipid peroxidation, GSH, SOD, and GPX. The histopathological findings, chest conventional X-ray, and immunohistochemistry of α-SMA confirmed the ameliorating effect of PF50. The docking outcomes reported the probable competitive inhibitory influence of PF50 on MMP-8 and a postulated blocking effect on EP2 and IL13α2R. Thus, PF50 could be a novel approach for treating pulmonary injuries."

One of its important applications is the repair of skin damage, although the path of its mechanism is still unknown. Platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGF-beta) is one of the important factors in wound healing and it has been observed that PDGF-β expression decreases with increasing age. In this study, for the first time, the effect of RJ on skin wounds has been investigated through the expression of PDGF-β and tissue studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 25 small laboratory male BALB/c mice were selected randomly and after creating a 5 mm wound on the back of their neck, they were treated with doses of 2.5, 10, and 40 mg/kg body weight, After sampling from the healed wound in 9th day, histopathological studies and the expression of PDGF-β gene were performed by Real-time PCR method. RESULTS: The findings of the present study showed that royal jelly caused a significant increase in PDGF-β (10.99 times) compared to the healthy group. Also, royal jelly increased the formation of covering tissue or epithelium, the synthesis of collagen, the presence of inflammatory cells, and the formation of new blood vessels. CONCLUSION: The oral treatment of royal jelly is probably effective in skin wound healing by changing the expression of PDGF-β.",

The present study aimed to quantify the effect of RJ supplementation on these outcomes. METHODS: A literature search of Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed/Medline, was conducted for RCTs investigating the efficacy of RJ on plasma liver enzymes and glycemic indices. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for net changes using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Ten RCTs were selected for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Combined estimate of effect sizes for the impact of RJ on neither the plasma liver enzymes nor the glycemic indices were statistically significant. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction of serum FPG in trials with intervention duration ≥ 8 weeks (WMD: -4.28 mg/dl, 95% CI -7.41 to -1.14 mg/dl, p = 0.007), and those conducted in non-healthy populations (WMD: -4.28 mg/dl, 95% CI -7.41 to -1.14, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: RJ does not significantly affect liver function and glycemic profile of adult population. In trials with longer intervention and those conducted in non-healthy populations a significant reduction of serum FBG was observed. This meta-analysis should be repeated in the future, with more primary articles included, in order to provide conclusive results.",

In vitro, non-clinical and clinical studies have confirmed its vital role as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. This narrative review discusses the possible effects of royal jelly on preventing common complications of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as inflammation, oxidative stress and intestinal dysbiosis, from the viewpoint of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM/3PM). It is concluded that RJ, predictively, can be used as a non-pharmacological therapy to prevent and mitigate complications related to NCDs, and the treatment must be personalised."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Royal jelly, a natural product from bees' hypopharyngeal glands, is commonly used in biomedicine due to its antioxidant and anti-tumor activities. The aim of this study was to compare royal jelly in free form and loaded in layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticle for the treatment of breast cancer with a focus on Th1 and T regulatory parameters in an animal model. METHODS: Nanoparticles were produced using the coprecipitation method and characterized using DLS, FTIR, and SEM techniques. Forty female BALB/c mice were inoculated with 7.5 x 105 4T1 cells and treated with royal jelly in free and nanoparticle form. Clinical signs and tumor volume were assessed weekly. The effect of royal jelly products on the serum level of IFN-γ and TGF-β was measured by ELISA. In addition, the mRNA expression of these cytokines and Th1 and regulatory T cells' transcription factors (T-bet and FoxP3) was assessed by real-time PCR in the splenocytes of tumor-bearing mice. RESULTS: The physicochemical analysis of nanoparticles confirmed the synthesis of LDH nanoparticles and loading of royal jelly into the LDH structures (RJ-LDH). Animal studies showed that royal jelly and RJ-LDH significantly reduced the size of tumor in BALB/c mice. Additionally, treatment with RJ-LDH significantly inhibited TGF-β and increased IFN-γ production. The data also revealed that RJ-LDH inhibited the differentiation of regulatory T cells, while promoting Th1 cell differentiation via regulating their master transcription factors. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that royal jelly and RJ-LDH could inhibit breast cancer progression by in-hibiting regulatory T cells and expansion of Th1 cell. Furthermore, the current study demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of royal jelly is enhanced by LDH nanoparticles; hence, RJ-LDH is significantly more efficient than Free-RJ in the treatment of breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Royal jelly (RJ) is a multifunctional bee product with a unique composition and wide-ranging biological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities. Still, little is known about the possible myocardial protective properties of RJ. Considering that sonication could enhance RJ bioactivity, this study aimed to assess the effects of non-sonicated (NS) and sonicated (S) RJ on fibrotic signaling, cell proliferation, and collagen production in cardiac fibroblasts. S-RJ was produced by ultrasonication at 20 kHz. Ventricular fibroblasts isolated from neonatal rats were cultured and treated with different concentrations of NS-RJ or S-RJ (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 µg/well). S-RJ significantly depressed the expression levels of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) mRNA across all the concentrations tested and was inversely associated with the expression of this profibrotic marker. S-RJ and NS-RJ displayed distinct dose-dependent effects on mRNA expression of several other profibrotic, proliferation, and apoptotic markers. Unlike NS-RJ, S-RJ elicited strong negative dose-dependent relationships with the expression of profibrotic markers (TG2, COL1A1, COL3A1, FN1, CTGF, MMP-2, α-SMA, TGF-β1, CX43, periostin), as well as proliferation (CCND1) and apoptotic (BAX, BAX/BCL-2) markers, indicating that RJ dose-response effects were significantly modified by sonification. NS-RJ and S-RJ increased the content of soluble collagen, while decreasing collagen cross-linking. Collectively, these findings show that S-RJ has a greater range of action than NS-RJ for downregulating the expression of biomarkers associated with cardiac fibrosis. Reduced biomarker expression and collagen cross-linkages upon cardiac fibroblast treatment with specific concentrations of S-RJ or NS-RJ suggests putative roles and mechanisms by which RJ may confer some protection against cardiac fibrosis.",

Royal jelly is one of the bee products that exert anti-inflammatory, insulin-like, and hypoglycemic activities. The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of royal jelly capsules on blood sugar and the clinical course of Covid-19 in the patients receiving corticosteroid therapy. In this clinical trial, 72 Covid-19 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and pulmonary involvement hospitalized in Shahrekord Hajar Hospital were enrolled and randomized into two groups: treatment (receiving corticosteroids and Royal Jelly 1000 mg capsules daily for 7 days) and placebo (given corticosteroids and placebo). Laboratory tests, blood sugar, and clinical courses were determined and compared. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 16. On day 7 after the onset of the intervention, the dosage and frequency of insulin, FBS level, and required corticosteroid showed a decrease in both groups but the inter-group difference was not significant (P > .05). As well, the Spo2 level indicated a non-significant increase and hospital stay length indicated a non-significant decrease in the intervention group (P > .05). Among the symptoms, only headache, cough, and dyspnea indicated an improvement in the intervention group (P < .05). Overall, the results indicated the short-term consumption of royal jelly could not significantly improve blood sugar and the clinical course of Covid-19; however, it could significantly improve headache, cough, and dyspnea in the patients.",

Adult male rats were divided into five groups (n = 8 each): control fed a standard diet, control + RJ (300 mg/kg), HFD, HFD + RJ (300 mg/kg), and HFD + RJ + CC (0.2 mg/kg). The treatment with RJ reduced weight gain, increased fat pads, and attenuated fasting hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose tolerance in the HFD-fed rats. It also reduced the serum levels of liver function enzymes, interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and leptin but significantly increased the serum levels of adiponectin. In addition, and with no effect on lipid excretion in stool, RJ significantly decreased the hepatic mRNA expression of SREBP1, serum, hepatic cholesterol, and triglycerides but increased hepatic mRNA levels of PPARα. Furthermore, RJ reduced the hepatic levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the livers of these rats. Of note, with no effect on the mRNA levels of AMPK, RJ stimulated the phosphorylation of AMPK and increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total glutathione (GSH) in the livers of the control and HFD-fed rats. In conclusion, RJ attenuates NAFLD via its antioxidant potential and adiponectin-independent activation of liver AMPK.",

The current study assesses the protective effect of royal jelly (RJ) and Chlorella vulgaris (CV) on the genotoxicity and hepatic injury induced by GA3 in rats. Daily oral administration of 55 mg/kg GA3 to rats for 6 constitutive weeks induced biochemical and histopathological changes in the liver via oxidative stress and inflammation. Co-administration of 300 mg/kg RJ or 500 mg/kg CV with GA3 considerably ameliorated the serum levels of AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), ALP (alkaline phosphatase), γGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase), total bilirubin, and albumin. Lowered malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) levels along with elevated SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and GPx (glutathione peroxidase) enzyme activities indicated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of both RJ and CV. Also, they improved the histological structure and reduced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions along with up-regulating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) and down-regulating activator protein 1 (AP-1) gene expression. Additionally, chromosomal abnormalities and mitotic index were nearly normalized after treatment with RJ and CV. In conclusion, RJ and CV can protect against GA3-induced genotoxicity and liver toxicity by diminishing oxidative stress and inflammation, and modulating the PPARα/AP-1 signaling pathway."

METHODS: Thirty-two Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups. Oral treatment was administered to all rats for 16 days after a single intraperitoneal injection. The control group received intraperitoneal and oral saline; the RJ group received intraperitoneal saline and 100 mg/kg/day oral RJ; the cyclophosphamide group received intraperitoneal 100 mg/kg cyclophosphamide and oral saline; and the treatment group received intraperitoneal 100 mg/kg cyclophosphamide and 100 mg/kg/day oral RJ. The groups were compared in terms of ovarian reserve tests and histopathological changes in the ovary and uterus. RESULTS: All follicle counts were higher in the treatment group than in the cyclophosphamide group. The increase in the number of preantral follicles (p=0.001) and the decrease in the number of atretic follicles (p=0.004) were statistically significant. RJ treatment significantly improved follicular degeneration and cortical fibrosis in the ovary and epithelial and gland degeneration in the uterus due to cyclophosphamide toxicity. CONCLUSION: According to these results, RJ reduces cyclophosphamide-related ovarian and endometrial damage in rats. For this reason, it should be further investigated to determine its effects on reproductive function."

      "abstract": "Apis mellifera royal jelly (RJ) is a well-known remedy in traditional medicine around the world and its versatile effects range from antibacterial to anti-inflammatory properties and pro-regenerative properties. As a glandular product, RJ has been shown to contain a substantial number of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and, in this study, we aimed to investigate the extent of involvement of RJEVs in wound healing-associated effects. Molecular analysis of RJEVs verified the presence of exosomal markers such as CD63 and syntenin, and cargo molecules MRJP1, defensin-1, and jellein-3. Furthermore, RJEVs were demonstrated to modulate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation and secretome, as well as decrease LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In vivo studies confirmed antibacterial effects of RJEVs and demonstrated an acceleration of wound healing in a splinted mouse model. This study suggests that RJEVs play a crucial role in the known effects of RJ by modulating the inflammatory phase and cellular response in wound healing. Transfer of RJ into the clinics has been impeded by the high complexity of the raw material. Isolating EVs from the raw RJ decreases the complexity while allowing standardization and quality control, bringing a natural nano-therapy one step closer to the clinics."

      "abstract": "Royal jelly is a nutritious substance produced by the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of honeybees. Royal jelly possesses many attractive and beneficial properties which make it an ideal component in medical and pharmaceutical products. The antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities of royal jelly from honeybees (Apis mellifera) were determined in this study. Moreover, the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the royal jelly were also evaluated. The effects of royal jelly on growth inhibition against skin pathogenic bacteria, including Cutibacterium acnes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Corynebacterium spp., were investigated by the agar well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were further determined by the broth dilution method. The results indicated that royal jelly showed antibacterial activity by inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, while the effectiveness decreased against Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, royal jelly from Lamphun (RJ-LP1), and Chiang Mai (RJ-CM1), presented high inhibitory efficacy against C. acnes, MRSA, and S. aureus within 4 h by a time killing assay. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory properties of royal jelly were tested using RAW264.7 macrophage cells, and results revealed that RJ-LP1 and RJ-CM1 could reduce nitric oxide (NO) production and suppress iNOS gene expression. After testing the antioxidant activity, RJ-CM1 and RJ-CM2 of royal jelly from Chiang Mai had the highest level. Additionally, RJ-CM1 also showed the highest total phenolic and flavonoid content. These findings have brought forward new knowledge of the antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties of royal jelly, which will improve clinical and pharmaceutical uses of royal jelly as an alternative therapy for bacterial infections, and also as a dietary supplement product.",

Wistar albino rats were chosen for the study, and they were randomly distributed into six groups: (i) control; (ii) royal jelly; (iii) fluoride-50; (iv) fluoride-100; (v) fluoride-50 + royal jelly; (vi) fluoride-100 + royal jelly. We established fluoride-induced brain tissue damage with 8-week-old male Wistar albino rats by administration of fluoride exposure (either 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg bw) through drinking water for 8 weeks. Then, the study duration is for 56 days where the rats were treated with or without RJ (100 mg/kg bw) through oral gavage. The effects of RJ on glutathione (GSH), catalase activity (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined via spectrophotometer. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the effects of royal jelly on the protein expression levels of Bax, caspase-3, caspase-6, Bcl-2, NF-κB, COX-2, and Erk. It was also studied the effects of RJ on histopathological alterations in fluoride-induced damage to the rat brain. As a result, the Bcl-2, NF-κB, and COX-2 protein expression levels were increased in the fluoride-treated (50 and 100 mg/kg) groups but they were decreased significantly by RJ treatment in the brain tissue. Additionally, the protein expression of caspase-3, caspase-6, Bax, and Erk were decreased in fluoride-treated groups and they were significantly increased by RJ treatment compared to the un-treated rats. Our results suggested that RJ prevented fluoride-induced brain tissue damage through anti-antioxidant activities.",

Although RJ exerts preventive effects on various lifestyle-related diseases, such as osteoporosis and obesity, no study evaluated the effect of RJ on the development of osteoarthritis (OA), the most common degenerative joint disease. Here, we showed that daily oral administration of raw RJ significantly prevented OA development in vivo following surgically-induced knee joint instability in mice. Furthermore, in vitro experiments using chondrocytes, revealed that raw RJ significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines and enzymes critical for the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Similar results were observed after treatment with 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid, the most abundant and unique fatty acid in raw RJ. Our results suggest that oral supplementation with RJ would benefit the maintenance of joint health and prophylaxis against OA, possibly by suppressing the activity of inflammatory cytokines and ECM-degrading enzymes.",

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of AT and RJ on inflammatory factors in the hippocampus, as well as depression and anxiety in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats with EAE were assigned to seven groups: (1) EAE without any other intervention (EAE); (2) sham, receiving normal saline (Sh); (3) 50 mg/kg RJ (RJ50); (4) 100 mg/kg RJ (RJ100); (5) AT; (6) AT + RJ50; and (7) AT + RJ100. In addition, a healthy control group was assessed. RESULTS: EAE significantly increased interleukin 17 (IL-17), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) gene expression and immobilization time as well as anxiety and depression indices, and significantly decreased interleukin 10 (IL-10), compared to the control group. AT decreased significantly IL-17, TGF-β gene expression and immobilization time as well as anxiety and depression indices, while it significantly increased IL-10, compared to the EAE group. RJ50 and RJ100 decreased significantly IL-17, IL-23 gene expression, anxiety and depression indices, and significantly increased IL-10 compared to the EAE group. AT + RJ50 and AT + RJ100 significantly decreased IL-17, IL-23, and TGF-β and as well as anxiety and depression indices while significantly increasing IL-10 compared to the EAE group. The effects of AT + RJ100 on significant decreasing IL-17, IL-23, anxiety and depression and increasing TGF-β, IL-10 were more favorable than RJ50. CONCLUSION: AT and RJ improved inflammatory and regulatory factors of autoimmunity and reduced anxiety and depression. The RJ combined with AT induced additive effects while using RJ100 was more favorable than RJ50.",

Viable treatments for such diseases using natural products and determinative biomarkers have been proposed but require evaluation to improve their effects. Therefore, this study aims to examine how effectively a specific natural product (namely, royal jelly) protects the body from the copy number of the virus, as well as TLR1 to TLR9 gene expressions. METHODS: The effectiveness of royal jelly was tested by giving it (orally) to 30 hepatitis B patients for one month. HBV copy number and mRNA levels of TLRs were explored using Real Time PCR technique, and liver enzymes were evaluated too. RESULTS: Orally treatment with royal jelly led to a significant decrease in HBV-DNA copy number, down-regulation of TLR2 and TLR8, and up-regulation of TLR3. However, mRNA levels of the TLRs were not altered in the female, while TLR1, TLR2, and TLR5 were significantly decreased in the male participants. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that royal jelly has anti-viral and anti-inflammatory roles in the in vivo conditions in a dependent manner in TLR3, TLR2, and TLR8. Therefore, it can be suggested as a safe complementary agent for patients with hepatitis B.",

Many studies in human and animal models have reported that royal jelly (RJ) can be used to treat atherosclerosis. However, the real mechanisms behind this action is unclear. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of RJ on gene expression of squalene epoxidase (SE) a major enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis in HepG2 cells. We found that the expression of SE was decreased in response to RJ treatment. We also found that the origin of the RJ affected its strength. To find out the active fraction of RJ in cholesterol suppression, we separated RJ into two parts based on the molecular weights using ultrafiltration membrane. We found that the fraction <10kDa from RJ had comparable effect on SE expression, especially its water-soluble part. Taken together, we think RJ suppresses cholesterol by decreasing SE gene expression in liver. The active fraction of RJ in this action is <10kDa in water-soluble form."

      "abstract": "Royal jelly is a gelatinous nutrient secretion produced by the mandibular glands of young worker honey bees and has a critical role in honey bee life. In the honey bee colonies, queen and worker honey bees have very different morphologies and behaviors due to their diet in the larval period, despite having the same genome. In comparison, queen bees formed from larvae that feed royal jelly exclusively, and worker bees formed from larvae that feed on much less royal jelly. DNA methylation has been shown to play a critical role in the development of queen and worker honeybees. Alterations in DNA methylation, one of the epigenetic mechanisms defined as hereditable nucleotide modifications that occur in gene expression without changes in the DNA sequence, are closely related to many diseases, especially cancer. Hypermethylation of CpG islands located in the promoter regions of genes causes gene silencing and tumor suppressor genes epigenetically have silenced in cancer. The inactivation of tumor suppressor genes disrupts nearly all cellular pathways in cancer. In contrast to genetic alterations, gene silencing by epigenetic modifications may potentially be reversed and used in cancer treatment. Royal jelly, which causes epigenetic changes in bee colonies, has the potential to cause a change in cancer cells. In our study, royal jelly's effects on DNA methyltransferase enzyme and gene methylation of RASSF1A tumor suppressor were investigated in human cancer cell lines (HeLa, HT29, and A549), and modifications in the gene expression profile of royal jelly were determined by next generation sequencing.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is one of the major causes of death globally. Currently, various methods are used to treat cancer, including radiotherapy, surgery, and chemotherapy, all of which have serious adverse effects. A healthy lifestyle, especially a nutritional diet, plays a critical role in the treatment and prevention of many disorders, including cancer. The above notion, plus the trend in going back to nature, encourages consumers and the food industry to invest more in food products and to find potential candidates that can maintain human health. One of these agents, and a very notable food agent, is royal jelly (RJ), known to be produced by the hypopharyngeal and mandibular salivary glands of young nurse honeybees. RJ contains bioactive substances, such as carbohydrates, protein, lipids, peptides, mineral salts and polyphenols which contribute to the appreciated biological and pharmacological activities. Antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and antibacterial impacts are among the well-recognized benefits. The combination of RJ or its constituents with anticancer drugs has synergistic effects on cancer disorders, enhancing the drug's effectiveness or reducing its side effects. The purpose of the present review is to emphasize the possible interactions between chemotherapy and RJ, or its components, in treating cancer illnesses.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of aerobic training and two dosages of royal jelly (RJ) on hippocampal CB1R and pain threshold (PT) in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. To this end, 56 female Sprague-Dawley rats with EAE were randomly assigned to one of the following eight conditions: (1) EAE; (2) sham; (3) 50 mg/kg RJ (RJ50); (4) 100 mg/kg RJ (RJ100); (5) exercise training (ET); (6) ET + RJ50; (7) ET + RJ100; and (8) not EAE or healthy control (HC). Endurance training was performed for five weeks, four sessions per week at a speed of 11-15 m/min for 30 min, and RJ was injected peritoneally at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day). One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc tests were performed to identify group-related differences in pain threshold (PT) and CB1R gene expression. Endurance training had no significant effect on PT and hippocampal CB1R in rats with EAE. CB1R gene expression levels in the RJ100 group were higher than in the EAE group. Further, PT levels in the ETRJ50 and ETRJ100 groups were higher than in the EAE group. The combination of ET and RJ50 had a higher impact on PT and CB1R, when compared to the ET and RJ50 alone. Next, there was a dose-response between RJ-induced CB1R gene expression and RJ dosages: higher dosages of RJ increased the CB1R gene expression. The overall results suggest that the combination of ET and increasing RJ dosages improved pain threshold probably related to CB1R in an EAE model, while this was not observed for ET or RJ alone.",

Western blot analysis was conducted to determine the post-translational expression levels of NF-κB, Bax, Bcl-2, TNF-α, Caspase-3 and Caspase-6 proteins in pancreas tissue. The pancreatic tissue was subjected to histopathological evaluation. Furthermore, MDA, GSH and CAT activities were examined by spectrophotometric analyzes. Our findings demonstrate that, compared to the control and RJ groups, Bcl-2 protein expression was augmented and, conversely, Caspase-6, Caspase-3 and Bax protein levels were decreased upon fluoride treatment. A statistically significant increase in TNF-α and NF-κB protein expressions was observed in the groups with fluoride-induced damage compared to the control and RJ groups. The MDA levels were increased in all fluoride-treated rats compared to those in the control and RJ groups, whereas the CAT and GSH activities were reduced in all rats with fluoride- induced damage.

RJ has gained increasing interest in recent years owing to its antioxidant potential. However, little is known about adequate RJ dosing and its effects on genetic material. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo effects of RJ on genotoxicity and mutagenicity induced by the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). In this study, 3-month-old Swiss albino male mice (N = 66) were divided into 11 groups for experimentation. Experiments were performed by administering lyophilized RJ (150 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg) or water via gavage as pre- and posttreatment processes with the alkylating agent MMS. After treatment, blood samples were collected from the mice via an incision at the end of the tail to conduct comet assays at times of 24 h and 48 h posttreatment. The mice were then euthanized to remove the bone marrow for a micronucleus test. Overall, regardless of dose, RJ did not exhibit genotoxic, mutagenic activity and the administration of high doses, mainly in the form of posttreatment, presented antigenotoxic and antimutagenic actions. Further, a dose-response correlation was observed in the RJ posttreatment groups. These results demonstrate that RJ administration was effective in reversing the damage caused by the alkylating agent MMS.",

      "abstract": "Relapse of leukemia and drug resistance are still the major obstacles to therapy due to leukemia-initiating stem/progenitor cells (LICs); thus, targeting them using safe compounds is crucial. Here, we evaluated the anti-leukemic effect of royal jelly (RJ) components, which had a higher safe concentration (EC100 values) than the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX). The RJ-protein fraction 50 (PF50, precipitated at 40-50% ammonium sulfate saturation) and its constituents, major RJ protein (MRJP) 2 and its isoform X1, exhibited the highest growth inhibitory effect against myeloid NFS-60 and lymphoid Jurkat cell lines. MRJP2 has a nanosize, which may be the reason for its higher anti-leukemic activity than its isoform. These RJ proteins, particularly MRJP2, suppressed LIC-associated oncogenes (GATA2 and Evi-1) and eliminated CD34+ LICs, in contrast to the low anti-LIC efficacy of DOX. MRJP2 demonstrated higher apoptotic activity than its isoform by upregulating p53 and p21-mediated cell cycle arrest. This study also reported the potent inhibitory effect of RJ-proteins on matrix metallopeptidase 10 (metastatic marker) and histone deacetylase 8 (mediates LIC survival) activities. Thus, MRJP2 can be considered a promising novel therapeutic agent for both myeloid and lymphoid leukemia.",

Thus, clarification of the mode of action of RJ is needed. Here, we investigated whether the estrogen-like actions of RJ are induced via estrogen receptors (ERs)-mediated genomic actions by using an in vitro reporter assay in human choriocarcinoma JEG3 cells and an estrogen-responsive reporter (E-Rep) mouse line that can be used to sensitively detect transactivation of ERs in multiple organs simultaneously. In the in vitro reporter assay, ERs-dependent transcriptional activity was significantly increased by 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment at concentrations of 1 nM and above, confirming that the assay was highly responsive to estrogen; however, RJ did not exhibit any agonist activity via either the α or β form of ER. Similarly, in E-Rep mice, E2 showed significant ERs-dependent genomic action in 17 tissue types including uterus and mammary gland, whereas RJ did not. Thus, unlike endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the estrogen-like activity of RJ is unlikely to be due to genomic actions via ERs.",

Additionally, the cytotoxicity of royal jelly was examined on HT-29 cell line. Findings. Based on the in vitro assessment using MTT assay, the LC50 of royal jelly was 1.781 mg/ml, and the highest cytotoxicity was observed at 25 mg/ml concentration after 48 hours. Meanwhile, in the in vivo study, after the 13th week, compared to the DMH group, the rats exposed to DMH + royal jelly experienced a significant less oxidative stress (P < 0.05) and a significantly greater total antioxidant capacity (TAC) level (P < 0.05). The expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) proteins significantly decreased among the animals receiving DMH + royal jelly compared to the DMH group. The pathological examinations revealed less congestion, necrosis, inflammation, and cell proliferation in the colon tissue of the RJ-treated group than that of the DMH group. Overall, the biochemical indices were better in the treatment groups in comparison with the DMH group. CONCLUSION: The results represented the clinical usability of royal jelly, as a substance with anticancer properties, to prevent and treat colorectal cancer. This issue is related to its effective antioxidant potential, which even exhibits more effectiveness than the vitamin E, which is known as a strong antioxidant.",

      "abstract": "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Acquisition of migratory potential is pivotal for cancer cells, enabling invasion and metastasis of colorectal carcinoma. Royal jelly and its bioactive component trans-10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10H2DA) showed remarkable antimetastatic potential, but the molecular mechanism underlying this activity is unclear. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Identification and quantification of 10H2DA in royal jelly originating from Serbia was done by HPLC method. Cytotoxicity of 10H2DA was measured by tetrazolium dye MTT test in concentration range 1-500 μg/mL after 24 and 72 h. Its effect on the collective and single-cell migration was measured by wound healing and transwell migration assays. Invasive potential of cancer cells was evaluated by a transwell method modified with collagen. Immunofluorescence was used for migratory and invasive protein expression, while the gene expression of these markers was evaluated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All assays were applied on human colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 and SW-480 cell lines and, except for MTT, evaluated after 24 h of treatment with two selected concentrations of royal jelly and 10H2DA. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: According to HPLC, the mass fraction of 10H2DA in royal jelly was 0.92% (m/m). Treatment with 10H2DA showed no cytotoxic effect; however, significant inhibitory potential of royal jelly and 10H2DA on the motility and invasiveness of colorectal cancer cells was observed. More pronounced effect was exerted by 10H2DA, which significantly suppressed collective cell migration and invasiveness of SW-480 cells, as well as single- and collective cell migration and invasive potential of HCT-116 cell line. Treatments increased epithelial markers E-cadherin and cytoplasmic β-catenin in HCT-116 cells, thus stabilizing intercellular connections. In SW-480 cells, 10H2DA increased E-cadherin on protein and gene level, and suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. In both cell lines, treatments induced significant suppression of promigratory/proinvasive markers: N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail on protein and gene level, which explains decreased migratory and invasive potential of HCT-116 and SW-480 cells. NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: Our study presents new findings and elucidation of royal jelly and 10H2DA molecular mechanism that underlies their antimigratory/antiinvasive activity on colorectal cancer cells. These findings are shown for the first time indicating that these natural products are a valuable source of anticancer potential and should be reconsidered for further antitumour therapy."

However, it may be associated with long-term complications, including induction of inflammation. This project was designed to examine the effects of MSC administration and its combination with royal jelly (RJ) on the differentiation of T helper subsets. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this project, the mice were divided to the six groups, including control (healthy without stroke), stroke (mice model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)), treated with mouse MSC (mMSC), royal jelly (RJ), combination of mMSC and RJ (mMSC + RJ) and MSC conditioned medium (SUP). Thereafter, sticky test, brain mRNA levels of T-bet (transcription factor for Th1 subset), GATA3 (transcription factor for Th2 subset), and ROR-γ (transcription factor for Th17 subset) and percentage of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities were explored in the groups. RESULTS: Administration of mMSC and mMSC + RJ improved the sticky test times and decreased the MPO activities. Using mMSCs and RJ was associated with increased expression of T-bet and GATA3 transcription factors. Transplantation of mMSCs in combination with RJ reduced expression of T-bet in the infarcted tissue. CONCLUSION: Using mMSC may be associated with Th1-related inflammation in the long term. RJ co-administration significantly reduced the risks, hence, to decrease the plausible side effects of MSCs, it can be proposed to use RJ in combination with MSC to reduce stroke complications.",

      "abstract": "At present, there are several synthetic medications for toxoplasmosis therapy; however, these agents cannot be permanently applied because of adverse side effects or therapeutic failures and drug resistance in parasites. The present experimental investigation was aimed to study the effects of royal jelly (RJ) obtained from Apis mellifera in comparison with atovaquone against Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice. After treatment of infected mice with RJ at the doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days, we evaluated the therapeutic activity of RJ by measuring the mean number and the mean size of T. gondii tissue cysts, oxidant-antioxidant enzymes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, the mRNA expression levels of bradyzoite surface antigen 1 (BAG1), as well as the toxic effect on liver and kidney function. Treatment of the infected mice with RJ significantly (p < 0.001) decreased the mean number and the mean diameter of T. gondii tissue cysts and downregulated BAG1 in a dose-dependent response. After treatment of infected mice with RJ, the level of oxidative stress markers was significantly diminished, but a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the level of antioxidant markers such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes was observed. Treatment of the infected mice with RJ significantly enhanced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-1β, whereas it caused no substantial change in the serum levels of liver and kidney enzymes. The findings of this in vivo study revealed the favorable therapeutic effect of RJ on latent T. gondii infection in mice. It was found that RJ considerably inhibited the infection by decreasing the number and size of tissue cysts, reducing oxidative stress, and boosting the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but had no significant toxic impact on the function of vital organs such as liver and kidney. However, additional surveys are required to confirm these findings and clarify the exact mechanisms and their efficiency in clinical subjects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excessive production of free radicals caused by many types of exercise results in oxidative stress, which leads to muscle damage, fatigue, and impaired performance. Supplementation with royal jelly (RJ) or coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has been shown to attenuate exercise-induced oxidant stress in damaged muscle and improve various aspects of exercise performance in many but not all studies. Nevertheless, the effects of treatments based on RJ plus CoQ10 supplementation, which may be potentially beneficial for reducing oxidative stress and enhancing athletic performance, remain unexplored. This study aimed to examine whether oral RJ and CoQ10 co-supplementation could improve high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) performance in swimmers, inhibiting exercise-induced oxidative stress and muscle damage. METHODS: Twenty high-level swimmers were randomly allocated to receive either 400 mg of RJ and 60 mg of CoQ10 (RJQ) or matching placebo (PLA) once daily for 10 days. Exercise performance was evaluated at baseline, and then reassessed at day 10 of intervention, using a HIIE protocol. Diene conjugates (DC), Schiff bases (SB), and creatine kinase (CK) were also measured in blood plasma and saliva before and immediately after HIIE in both groups. RESULTS: HIIE performance expressed as number of points according to a single assessment system developed and approved by the International Swimming Federation (FINA points) significantly improved in RJQ group (p = 0.013) compared to PLA group. Exercise-induced increase in DC, SB, and CK levels in plasma and saliva significantly diminished only in RJQ group (p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed that oral RJQ administration for 10 days was significantly associated with reductions in HIIE-induced increases in plasmatic and salivary DC, SB, and CK levels compared to PLA. Principal component analysis revealed that swimmers treated with RJQ are grouped by both plasmatic and salivary principal components (PC) into a separate cluster compared to PLA. Strong negative correlation between the number of FINA points and plasmatic and salivary PC1 values was observed in both intervention groups. CONCLUSION: The improvements in swimmers' HIIE performance were due in significant part to RJQ-induced reducing in lipid peroxidation and muscle damage in response to exercise. These findings suggest that RJQ supplementation for 10 days is potentially effective for enhancing HIIE performance and alleviating oxidant stress.

METHODS: Thirty regional-level runners (age: 19 ± 1 years; height: 173 ± 2 cm; body mass: 68.9 ± 2 kg; body mass index: 23.1 ± 1 kg/m2) were randomly allocated to receive either 400 mg of RJ and 60 mg of CoQ10 (RJQ) or matching placebo (PLA) once daily for 10 days. Exercise performance expressed as time taken to complete HIIE was evaluated at baseline, and then reassessed at day 10 of intervention. HIIE protocol applied to the runners included three repetitions of 100 m distance at maximum possible speed interspersed with 45 s of recovery periods. Indices of heart rate variability and blood lactate concentration were also measured before and immediately after HIIE in each group. RESULTS: HIIE performance significantly improved in RJQ group (p = 0.005) compared to PLA group. Blood lactate levels and sympathetic influence on the heart were significantly lower both before and after the HIIE in athletes who received RJQ (p < 0.05) compared to PLA. Regression analysis showed that oral RJQ administration for 10 days was significantly associated with reductions in HIIE-induced increases in blood lactate concentration and enhanced cardiac parasympathetic modulation following exercise compared to PLA. Principal component analysis revealed that runners treated with RJQ are grouped by the first two principal components into a separate cluster compared to PLA. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the improvements in runners' HIIE performance were due in significant part to RJQ-induced reduction of increment in blood lactate levels in response to exercise in combination with a more rapid shift in autonomic activity toward increased parasympathetic control early at post-exercise. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that RJQ supplementation for 10 days is potentially effective for enhancing HIIE performance and alleviating adverse effects of increased intramuscular acidity and prolonged sympathetic dominance following intense exercise."

The physiochemical parameters (water, protein, 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid, total sugar, starch, ash and acidity) of the RJ samples used in this study met the requirements of the international and Chinese national standards. Treatment with RJ improved symptoms and colonic cell apoptosis and decreased intestinal permeability by increasing the expression of tight-junction protein, goblet cells and their secretion mucin, MUC2, in DSS-induced ulcerative colitis mice. RJ also reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and sIgA. DSS resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of Parabacteroides, Erysipelotrichaceae, Proteobacteria (Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacteriales and Enterobacteriaceae) and Escherichia Shigella in the colon and a decrease in the relative abundance of Muribaculum.

These results suggested that RJ alleviated DSS-induced colitis by improving the colonic mucosal barrier.",

The DOX plus honey treated group was injected with DOX and on the next day, received 500 mg/kg/day of honey orally for 21 days. The DOX plus royal jelly treated group was injected with DOX and on the following day, received 100 mg/kg/day of royal jelly orally for 21 days. The DOX plus propolis treated group received DOX and on the following day, was treated orally with 50 mg/kg/day of propolis for 21 days. The DOX plus combined treatment group received DOX and on the following day, was treated with a mix of honey, royal jelly, and propolis orally for 21 days. Results confirmed that DOX raised creatinine, urea, MDA, and TNF-α while decreasing GPX and SOD. Damages and elevated caspase-3 expression were discovered during renal tissue's histopathological and immunohistochemical studies. Combined treatment with honey, royal jelly, and propolis improved biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical studies in the renal tissue. qRT-PCR revealed increased expression of poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and a decline of Bcl-2 in the DOX group. However, combined treatment induced a significant decrease in the PARP-1 gene and increased Bcl-2 expression levels. In addition, the combined treatment led to significant improvement in the expression of both PARP-1 and Bcl-2 genes. In conclusion, the combined treatment effectively inhibited nephrotoxicity induced by DOX."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study was aimed at evaluating the antitumor effects of royal jelly (RJ) obtained from Apis mellifera compared with cyclophosphamide against the Ehrlich solid tumors (EST) in mice. METHODS: Tumor growth inhibition, body weight, the serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen tumor (CAE), liver and kidney enzymes, tumor lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase enzyme (CAT), and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity (SOD)), tumor necrosis factor alpha level (TNF-α), and the apoptosis-regulatory genes expression were assessed in EST mice treated with RJ (200 and 400 mg/kg orally once a day for 2 weeks). RESULTS: The results showed that treatment of EST-suffering mice with RJ at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg causes significant reduction in tumor volume and inhibition rate, body weight, tumor markers (AFP and CEA), serum level of liver and kidney, LPO and NO, TNF-α level, as well as the expression level of Bcl-2 in comparison with the EST mice receiving the normal saline; whereas RJ at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg/day significantly increased (p < 0.05) the level of antioxidant enzymes of GPx, CAT, and SOD and the expression level of caspase-3 and Bax genes. CONCLUSION: The findings revealed that oral administration of royal jelly especially at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg exhibited promising antitumor effects against EST in mice through induction of apoptosis as well as its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which suggest it as a novel anticancer agent against tumor; however, additional surveys especially in clinical setting are necessary to approve these findings.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the major cause of global chronic hepatic injury, has obtained increasing attention while the current drug treatment still laid safety hazards. Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), the water-soluble proteins enriched in royal jelly (RJ), were applied to study its effects on improving NAFLD in the NAFLD mouse model. Herein, we demonstrated that intaking of 250-500 mg/kg/day MRJPs significantly decreased the rate of obesity, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Next, TOF to MRM (\"TM\") widely targeted metabolomics (untargeted metabolomics + widely targeted metabolomics) was further used to explore the potential mechanism, and we found that 500 mg/kg MRJPs alleviated lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation mainly by regulating the metabolisms of alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, by detecting multiple oxidative stress factors and inflammatory cytokines, we found that MRJPs indeed exerted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Together, we demonstrated that MRJPs could mediate the progress of NAFLD through the \"multi-component-multi-target-multi-pathway\" mechanism, which could be considered as an ideal functional food in alleviating NAFLD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Royal jelly (RJ) is a bee product with high nutritional value. Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) are water-soluble proteins in RJ. Our research showed that MRJPs significantly ameliorated NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet in mice, suggesting that MRJPs could be used as an active ingredient to help improve NAFLD, which was beneficial for the development of related functional foods and the economic value of RJ. Moreover, the metabolic pathways involved in the ameliorative effect of MRJPs were investigated, which provided new ideas for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.",

The current study investigated HDU- induced hepatic injury and the protective potential of the royal jelly (RJ) against this hepatotoxic effect in the light of hepatic oxidative/ antioxidative status, pro-inflammatory cytokine, apoptosis signaling pathway, and histopathology. Sixty albino rats were used (n = 10/group) for 60 days: control, RJ (100 mg/kg body weight, orally), HDU (225 mg/kg body weight, orally), 2HDU (450 mg/kg body weight, orally), and HDU + RJ groups. HDU-treated rats showed significant elevation of liver function tests as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as malondialdehyde and nitric oxide (oxidative biomarkers) and significant decreased hepatic antioxidant molecules (reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase), compared to a control group, that more pronounced in the high dose of HDU. In addition, HDU induced significant upregulation of TNF-α and the Caspase-3 apoptotic pathway. Moreover, the liver of HDU treated groups showed various hepatic lesions from mild to severe necrotic changes related to the HDU dose. However, administration of RJ with HDU improved liver function tests, liver histology, and hepatic oxidative/antioxidative status concerning HDU groups. Furthermore, oral RJ administration with HDU significantly lessens the immune-expression area % of TNF-α and Caspase-3. Thus, the royal jelly has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties against HDU- induced hepatic injury and could be, therefore, used as adjuvant therapy in patients with long-term HDU medication.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nicotine administration can generate severe oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Royal jelly, with its antioxidant properties, acts as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species. This study describes the apitherapy effects of royal jelly on testicular damage following nicotine administration. METHODS: Forty-eight male BALB/c mice were divided into 8 groups (n = 6): saline, 3 different doses of royal jelly (100, 150, and 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) per day), nicotine (1.5 mg/kg), and 3 different groups of Nic + Roy (1.5 mg/kg of Nic + 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg BW per day of royal jelly). Nicotine was administrated intraperitoneally, and royal jelly was prescribed orally for 10 consecutive days. Serum levels of hormones (testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone), total antioxidant capacity, nitric oxide (NO) status, malondialdehyde levels, sperm DNA fragmentation, sperm parameters, histopathological changes (H&E staining), immunohistochemistry against apoptotic proteins, and gene expression of Bcl-2, p53, Caspase-3, and Nrf2 (real-time PCR) were assessed to evaluate the molecular and histological changes. RESULTS: Hormone levels, sperm parameters, and status of antioxidants were decreased significantly (p < .05) following nicotine administration. Moreover, royal jelly treatment normalized hormonal and antioxidant characteristics, decreased apoptotic gene expression, increased Nfr2 gene expression, and restored histopathological alteration to the physiological status significantly (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Royal jelly upregulates the antioxidant status, inhibits the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway, and increases the rate of proliferation. This therapeutic agent effectively protected the testis against nicotine-associated damages by antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects.",

The two injury groups were given 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg fluoride, respectively. The two treatment groups exposed to 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg fluoride were both fed basal diets with RJ (100 mg/kg). Lungs were taken for histopathological examination. Spectrophotometric analysis was utilized to determine Malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) activities, and Western blotting technique was used to evaluate the levels of specific proteins. On one hand, our experiments revealed that RJ caused decreased MDA levels, and downregulation of COX-2, Bcl-2, GSK3 and TNF-α protein expressions. On the other hand, rolay jelly caused augmented GSH and CAT activities, as well as upregulated Bax, BDNF, caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-9 protein expressions in rats injuried by the fluoride exposure. The results suggest that the application of RJ was very likely to have a healing effect on the degenerative changes seen in the examined tissue.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia among the older population, is associated with acute or chronic inflammation. As a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin has recently been widely studied in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is a controversy about the efficacy as well as the adverse effects of aspirin. 10-Hydroxydecanoic acid (10-HDAA) is a characteristic fatty acid found in the honey bee product royal jelly. In this study, we found that 10-HDAA attenuated the activation of the NF-κB pathway, then targeted Ptgs-1/2, the well-known target of aspirin. Hence, combined therapy of 10-HDAA and aspirin was conducted. In vitro assays suggested that this combinatory group alleviated LPS-induced inflammation in BV-2 cells, as assessed by the downregulation of nitric oxide, COX-2, and IL-6 compared to 10-HDAA or aspirin treatment alone. In vivo assays showed that the combined treatment synergistically inhibited the overactivation of glial cells and decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, 10-HDAA alleviated the adverse effects of aspirin on gastrointestinal injuries and microbiota dysbiosis. The Morris water maze test indicated that neither 10-HDAA nor aspirin effectively improved LPS-induced memory dysfunction, but the combined therapy showed synergistic effects. Altogether, our findings support 10-HDAA and aspirin combinatory therapy as the basis for future therapeutics for AD and other neuroinflammation-related diseases with minimal adverse effects.",

Spermatogenesis indices were ameliorated following RJ co-administration. Moreover, RJ co-treatment reduced germinal cells RNA damage, improved sperm characteristics, boosted pre-implantation embryo development and restored androgenesis, and oxidant/anti-oxidant status. Co-administration of RJ also decreased mRNA levels of cyclin D1 and up-regulated those of c-myc in two-cell embryos, morulas and blastocysts.

Insecticidal activity of RJ and 10-H2DA, 10-HDAA, and sebacic acid was performed against healthy 4th instar larvae at 25 ± 2°C. Antiplasmodial and antileishmanial effects of RJ and 10-H2DA, 10-HDAA, and sebacic acid were also performed against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum K1-strain and Leishmania major amastigotes according to the Malstat method and macrophage model, respectively. In addition, the level of nitric oxide (NO) production in J774-A1 macrophages cells, plasma membrane permeability, and caspase-3-like activity and cytotoxicity effects of RJ and 10-H2DA, 10-HDAA, and sebacic acid against human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK239T cells) were evaluated. Considering the insecticidal activity, the results showed that the lethal concentration 50% value for RJ, 10-H2DA, 10-HDAA, and sebacic acid was 24.6, 31.4, 37.8, and 44.7 μg/mL μg/mL, respectively. RJ, 10-H2DA, 10-HDAA, and sebacic acid showed potent (P < 0.0001) antileishmanial effects with IC50 values ranging from 2.4 to 8.4 μg/mL. Various concentrations of RJ, 10-H2DA, 10-HDAA, and sebacic acid significantly (P < 0.05) increased the production of NO, plasma membrane permeability, and caspase-3-like activity level as a dose-dependent response. Considering the cytotoxicity, SIs > 10 of these compounds exhibited their specificity to parasites and safety against human HEK239T normal cells. The results of the present investigation revealed the promising insecticidal, antimalarial, and antileishmanial effects of RJ and its three main fatty acids (10-H2DA, 10-HDAA, and sebacic acid).

      "abstract": "Royal jelly (RJ) is rich in protective elements associated with collective immune defenses in the hive of Apis mellifera. Exposure of bees to glyphosate-based herbicides causes ultrastructural changes in the hypopharyngeal glands and a reduction in the production of RJ. However, the effects of glyphosate-based herbicides on the protein composition of RJ and consequences for the hive are unknown. Thus, we performed proteomic profiling of royal jelly produced in hives of A. mellifera exposed to food containing 1,5 μL of Roundup® (2.16 mg. g-1 of glyphosate). The production of RJ was carried out in six hives, following the method of artificial production of queens. The combs containing 80 grafting cells were introduced into the hives, and the collection of royal jelly was performed after 72 h. Two treatments were determined based on hive feeding and the hive as the experimental unit: Control and \"Roundup®\". Royal jelly from the Roundup® treatment hives was compared to the Control hives. Proteins with differences in expression were identified by mass spectrometry. Only the proteins present in all three biological replicates were considered in the differential abundance analysis, using Student's t-test (p-value < 0.05, two-tailed). Hives that received food containing Roundup®, analysis showed alterations in protein profile in the RJ produced therein. In total, 24 proteins were identified, and the accumulation of Major royal jelly protein 3 (MRJP3) was downregulated, showing a significant reduction in hives exposed to food containing Roundup® in relation to control hives (t = 0.0017). MRJP3 acts analogously to polyclonal antigen-antibody reactions, performing functions related to immunity in bees of different ages and castes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate changes in the proteomic profile of RJ caused by glyphosate-based herbicides, indicating its negative effects on the nutrition and social immunity of bees.",

      "abstract": "Oral diseases affect a very large number of people, and the applied pharmacological methods of treatment and/or prevention have serious side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to search for new, safer methods of treatment. Natural bee products, such as honey, royal jelly, and bee venom, can be a promising alternative in the treatment of oral cavity bacterial infections. Thus, we performed an extensive literature search to find and summarize all articles about the antibacterial activity of honey, royal jelly, and bee venom. Our analysis showed that these bee products have strong activity against the bacterial strains causing caries, periodontitis, gingivitis, pharyngitis, recurrent aphthous ulcers, supragingival, and subgingival plaque. An analysis of average MIC values showed that honey and royal jelly have the highest antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In turn, bee venom has an antibacterial effect against Streptococcus mutans. Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptoccus pyogenes were the most resistant species to different types of honey, and royal jelly, respectively. Moreover, these products are safer in comparison to the chemical compounds used in the treatment of oral cavity bacterial infections. Since the antimicrobial activity of bee products depends on their chemical composition, more research is needed to standardize the composition of these compounds before they could be used in the treatment of oral cavity bacterial infections."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis (HD) is a common renal replacement therapy for patients with renal failure. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are known to shorten survival periods and worsen the quality of life of HD patients. Atherosclerosis is a major cause of vascular diseases, and various factors such as abnormality of lipid metabolism and increased macrophage activity, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction are associated with its pathogenesis and progression. Further, endothelial stem cells (ESCs) have been reported to play important roles in endothelial functions. Royal jelly (RJ) affects atherosclerosis- and endothelial function-related factors. The main aim of this trial is to investigate whether oral intake of RJ can maintain endothelial function in HD patients. In addition, the effects of RJ intake on atherosclerosis, ESC count, inflammation, and oxidative stress will be analyzed. METHODS: This will be a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We will enroll 270 participants at Nagasaki Jin Hospital, Shinzato Clinic Urakami, and Maeda Clinic, Japan. The participants will be randomized into RJ and placebo groups. The trial will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants will be required to provide written informed consent. The RJ group will be treated with 3600 mg/day of RJ for 24 months, and the placebo group will be treated with starch for 24 months. The primary endpoint will be the change in flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a parameter of endothelium function, from the time before treatment initiation to 24 months after treatment initiation. The secondary and other endpoints will be changes in FMD; ESC count; serum levels of vascular endothelial cell growth factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, and malondialdehyde; the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and stenosis of blood access; and safety. DISCUSSION: This trial will clarify whether oral intake of RJ can maintain endothelial function and suppress the progression of atherosclerosis in HD patients. In addition, it will clarify the effects of RJ on ESCs, oxidative stress, and angiogenic activity in blood samples.

This study aims to investigate the effect of RJ on HMG and the dose-response relationship of RJ in the treatment of HMG. METHODS AND RESULTS: HMG rats are induced by intramuscular injection of estrogen (E2) and progesterone, and are treated with different doses of RJ (100, 200, 400, and 800 mg kg-1 d-1 ). As a result, RJ improves the expansion of acinar and breast tissue ducts, particularly at 100 and 800 mg kg-1 d-1 . These two doses also inhibit serum E2 and prolactin (PRL) secretion and increase serum progesterone secretion and the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-β in the breast tissue. In addition, 800 mg kg-1 d-1 decrease and increase the mRNA expression of, respectively, hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and pituitary GnRH receptors (GnRH-R). The lowest dosage (100 mg kg-1 d-1 ) increases GnRH-R mRNA expression as well. However, the effects of 200 and 400 mg kg-1 d-1 RJ on the reproductive parameters of HMG are not significant, implying a dose-dependent effect. CONCLUSION: RJ regulates endocrine dyscrasia in HMG rats and improves the breast tissue structure, indicating its potential in the prevention and treatment on HMG.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of action of royal jelly (RJ) and propolis compared to photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in an animal model of 5-fluorouracil-related oral mucositis (OM). METHODS: Seventy-two male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to four groups (n = 18 each): control (no treatment), PBMT (intraoral laser, 6 J/cm2), RJ, and propolis. On days 0 and 2, the animals received an injection of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The buccal mucosa was scratched (days 3 and 4) and the treatments were initiated on day 5. Six animals of each group were euthanized on days 8, 10, and 14. Phytochemical analysis (thin-layer chromatography, TLC) and clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical analysis of pS6, pAKT, and NF-κB were performed, and oxidative stress markers were also investigated. RESULTS: TLC revealed the presence of large amounts of sucrose (Rf 0.34) in RJ and of flavonoids in propolis. Lower clinical OM scores were observed on day 8, and improved morphological data were observed on day 10 in the PBMT, RJ, and propolis groups (p < 0.05). On day 8, immunoexpression of pS6, pAKT, and NF-κB was increased compared to control. On day 14, reduced glutathione (GSH) antioxidant levels were increased in the propolis group compared to control (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that RJ and propolis, as well as PBMT, are effective in the treatment of OM. Considering that some patients who develop OM do not have access to PBMT, the present study demonstrated that topical application of RJ and propolis may be an important alternative for the treatment of OM.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have shown the effects of rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REM-SD) on behavior and brain structures. The impact of REM-SD on learning and memory, thus neurogenesis, has been reported in previous studies. Royal jelly (RJ) is known as the wealthiest biological nutrient with various physiological properties. This study aimed to study the possible effect of RJ on neurogenesis of the rat hippocampus neonates following exposure of mother to REM-SD during pregnancy. METHODS: Thirty neonate rats from 15 pregnant Wistar rats were used. To induce REM-SD, the flowerpot method was used. The pregnant rats were divided into five groups (n = 3): group 1, no treatment; group 2, REM-SD; groups 3, 4, and 5, REM-SD +RJ. The former group received 72 h REM-SD during pregnancy (days 7, 14, 21), and the latter group received REM-SD + RJ (three trial groups). At week 4, the rat neonates of all groups were sacrificed (n = 6 each group). Their brains were fixed, removed, and prepared for Nissl and Hoechst 33342 staining. By using real time polymerase chain reaction methode the brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF gene expression was studied (RT-PCR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression was studied. The results were analyzed statistically, and the Pv  < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The results showed a significant decrease in the number of neurons in the hippocampus of neonatal rats of REM-SD mothers compared to the neonates of the mother with REM-SD + RJ. REM-SD also led to an increase in apoptosis reaching the neonates from the REM-SD + RJ animals. High expression of BDNF was observed in the hippocampus of the neonates from REM-SD + RJ treated mothers. CONCLUSION: RJ acts as a neuroprotective agent that could compensate for the effects of REM-SD on learning and memory via restoring neurogenesis.",

Forty-eight Sprague Dawley female rats weighing 205.023 ± 21.54 g were maintained in a standard condition. The rats were randomly divided into one of the six groups: Control (no intervention), Sham-1 (remove of uterine horn), RJ (administration of 200 mg/kg/day RJ for 21 days), Endometriosis (induction of endometriosis), Treatment (induction of endometriosis+administration of 200 mg/kg/day RJ for 21 days), and Sham-2 (induction of endometriosis+administration of water). Formalin test performed for pain evaluation. The levels of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean pain scores in all three phases of the formalin test were significantly increased by endometriosis induction (p < 0.05). The concentrations of BDNF, NGF, and CGRP in DRG of the endometriosis group were significantly higher than these factors in the Control, Sham-1, and RJ groups (p < 0.05). RJ could significantly (p < 0.001) decrease the mean lesion size and the mean pain score in the late phase (p < 0.05). The present results determine that endometriosis pain may be related to nervous system neurotrophic factors. Treatment with RJ could decrease the size of endometriosis lesions as well as pain scores. The findings may shed light on other complementary and alternative remedies for endometriosis.",

After 8 weeks, the rats were decapitated, and their muscle tissues were removed. Expression levels of Caspase-3, Caspase-6, Bax, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 alpha (IL1-α) and Bcl-2 proteins in muscle tissue were determined by western blotting method. Histopathological analyses were also performed on the muscle tissue. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) analyses were determined by a spectrophotometer. According to the obtained results, Bcl-2, TNF-α and IL1-α protein expression was increased in damage groups compared to the control and royal jelly groups, while Caspase-3, Caspase-6 and Bax protein expression levels decreased in damage groups. MDA level increased in damage groups compared to the control and royal jelly groups, while CAT and GSH levels increased with royal jelly application in royal jelly-given group in comparison to the flouride-exposed group. According to histopathological analysis results, edema and inflammatory cell formations were found in the injury groups, a tendency to decrease in these injuries was observed in the treatment groups.

Our previous studies have shown that royal jelly (RJ) has restored the capacity for tear secretion by modulating muscarinic calcium signaling. RJ contains acetylcholine, which is a major cholinergic neurotransmitter, and a unique set of fatty acids with C 8 to 12 chains, which are expected to be associated with health benefits. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the active components involved in tear secretion capacity, focusing on acetylcholine and fatty acids in RJ. Using the stress-induced dry-eye model mice, it was confirmed that acetylcholine with three fatty acids (10-hydroxydecanoic acid, 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid, and (R)-3,10-dihydroxydecanoic acid) was essential for tear secretion. In ex vivo Ca2+ imaging, these three fatty acids suppressed the decrease in intracellular modulation of Ca2+ in the lacrimal gland by acetylcholine when treated with acetylcholinesterase, indicating that the specific type of RJ fatty acids contributed to the stability of acetylcholine. To our knowledge, this study is the first to confirm that a specific compound combination is important for the pharmacological activities of RJ. Our results elucidate the active molecules and efficacy mechanisms of RJ.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The current tools for the management of diabetes mellitus (DM) do not prevent its development or complications, so investigations into promising new treatments, for example, honey-royal jelly (H-RJ) mixtures, are needed. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of royal jelly on DM by measuring the biochemical parameters (fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]) accompanying streptozotocin (i.p. 75 mg/kg once)-induced type 1 DM (T1DM) in rats. Other objectives were to evaluate the effects of H-RJ on lipid parameters. METHODS: Ten healthy control male Sprague-Dawley rats (120-150 g) were compared to untreated T1DM (n = 10), metformin-treated T1DM (n = 10), and H-RJ-treated T1DM rats (n = 10) on plasma and whole-blood glycemic control indices (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c %, insulin, and insulin resistance) and plasma lipid profile (triglycerides [TGs] and total, low-density lipoprotein -, high-density lipoprotein -, and very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]-cholesterol). Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (SZT) at 75 mg/kg body weight (BW). The T1DM-H-RJ rat group received daily RJ (100 mg/kg BW). Parametric data are presented as mean ± SD and were analyzed for comparison using one-way ANOVA in SPSS software. RESULTS: H-RJ normalized glycemic control indices, but its effect on lipid parameters was variable. H-RJ and metformin had comparable effects. The H-RJ treatment caused a significant reduction in plasma VLDL-C content in comparison to the control treatment and metformin. The limitation of this study is that it was restricted to T1DM and did not involve type 2 DM. In addition, the study was limited to male Sprague-Dawley rats, with no females. CONCLUSION: The H-RJ mixture is a promising antidiabetic alternative medicine. It effectively reduces VLDL-C and TG in diabetic rats."

Protein expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-9, Bcl-2, Bax, BDNF, Gsk-3, Nrf-2 and NF-κB proteins in heart tissue were determined by western blotting technique and hearth tissue evaluated by histopathologically. As a result, MDA levels, Bcl-2, Gsk-3 and NF-κB protein expression levels were reduced, whereas GSH levels, caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-6, Bax, BDNF and Nrf-2 protein levels were increased in the F50 + RJ and F100 + RJ groups compared to the F50 and F100 groups. According to the results of this study, it has been concluded that Royal jelly has the potential to be developed in to a drug for treatment of heart diseases in addition to providing protection against heart damage.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of royal jelly (RJ) on the morphology of the reproductive tract, egg production, and blood biochemical indices of aged laying hens. In total, 120 Lohman Brown laying hens at week 58 of age were randomly assigned into three equal groups. Pure RJ was dissolved in distilled water and injected subcutaneously as follows: the first treatment (R1; 100 mg RJ kg-1); the second treatment (R2; 200 mg RJ kg-1); the control treatment (CON; 1 mL distilled water). Both RJ-treated groups exhibited a significantly higher number of large yellow follicles (LYFs), small yellow follicles (SYFs), and large white follicles (LWFs) (p ˂ 0.05). Furthermore, RJ treatment significantly increased the diameter and weight of the F1 follicles. However, only the R2 group exhibited significantly greater ovary and uterus weights. RJ treatment did not affect the percentage of oviduct and weight of ovarian stroma. In addition, RJ increased the hen-day egg production rate compared with the CON group; however, only the R2 group showed greater egg weight (p = 0.032). RJ treatment also improved the albumen height, Haugh units, and yolk index. The administration of RJ significantly decreased the serum glucose, but increased the levels of serum albumen and cholesterol. In conclusion, RJ treatment may improve the morphology of the reproductive tract (including follicular growth and oviduct morphology), egg production rate, and internal egg quality traits of aged laying hens."

      "abstract": "Royal jelly (RJ) and selenium (Se)-rich foods have well-known health benefits which are attributable to a broad range of pharmacologic effects including antioxidant, bacteriostatic, anticancer, and immunoregulatory activities. However, there was no study to combine Se with RJ. Here, Se-rich RJ (SRJ) was produced by feeding sodium selenite to honeybees (Apis mellifera). To further clarify the function of SRJ, mice were then fed RJ or SRJ for 30 days, and their antioxidant capacity and gut microbiota profile were analyzed. The results showed that SRJ treatment could more effectively increase glutathione peroxidase levels in the liver and kidney, as well as total antioxidant activity in the liver and superoxide dismutase level in the kidney. Additionally, the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and relative abundance of the Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae families were increased, whereas the abundance of Helicobacterceae was decreased in mice treated with SRJ. At the genus level, SRJ increased the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Prevotellaceae UCG 001, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, and Oscillibacter and decreased that of Alistipes. And the functional prediction of gut microbiota indicated SRJ treatment could enhance the amino acid metabolism. Correlation analysis indicated that SRJ could optimize the functional network of gut microbiota and the interactions between the gut microbiota and the host. These results suggested the SRJ had potential therapeutic applications in the improvement of overall health or treatment of diseases related to oxidative stress or dysbiosis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cause of the majority of cancer-related deaths in women, among which triple-negative breast cancer is the most aggressive type of breast cancer diagnosed with limited treatment options. Thymoquinone (TQ), the main bioactive constituent of Nigella sativa, has been extensively studied as a potent anticancer molecule against various types of cancers. Honeybee products such as the royal jelly (RJ), the nutritive secretion fed to honeybee queens, exhibit a variety of biological activities besides its anticancer effect. However, the anticancer activity of the combination of TQ and RJ against breast cancer is still unknown. AIM: To investigate cytotoxicity of RJ in FHs 74 Int cells and the anticancer effects of TQ, RJ, and their combinations in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. METHODS: Cells were treated with TQ, RJ, and their combinations for 24 h. Using 3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, we determined the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of TQ. Trypan blue and 3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays were then performed to assess the cell viability in response to different treatment conditions. Cell death and cycle regulation were investigated using propidium iodide deoxyribonucleic acid staining followed by flow cytometry in response to a single dose of TQ, RJ, and their combination. Immunostaining for cleaved caspase 3 and Ki67 expression was used to determine apoptosis induction and changes in cell proliferation. RESULTS: TQ alone inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations below and above the half-maximal inhibitory concentration. RJ exhibited relatively nontoxic effects against MDA-MB-231 cells and FHs 74 Int small intestinal cells at concentrations below 5 µg/mL. High doses of RJ (200 µg/mL) had greater toxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, the inhibition of cell viability was most pronounced in response to 15 µmol/L TQ and 5 µg/mL RJ. A dose of 15 µmol/L TQ caused a significant increase in the PreG1 population, while a more pronounced effect on cell viability inhibition and PreG1 increase was observed in response to TQ and RJ combinations. TQ was the main inducer of caspase 3-dependent apoptosis when applied alone and in combination with RJ. In contrast, no significant regulation of Ki67 expression was observed, indicating that the decrease in cell viability was due to apoptosis induction rather than to inhibition of cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report enhanced anticancer effects of TQ and RJ combination against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which could confer an advantage for cancer therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to chronic stress has detrimental effects on cognitive and emotional processing. Also, the neuroprotective influences of environmental enrichment (EE) and royal jelly (RJ) have been indicated in previous studies. AIMS: To our knowledge, to date, there are no studies about the synergistic effects of EE and RJ on cognitive changes induced by stress. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the protective effects of RJ, and EE on anxiety-like behaviors, cognitive functions, and expression of hippocampal and also prefrontal cortex (PFC) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in stressed rats. METHODS: By using restraint and cold temperature, rats were exposed to stressful situations and then subjected to treatment with RJ or/ and EE for 14 days. Stress induction was done 14 days before treatments by placing the rats in the restrainer under 4°C. Following the interventions, anxiety-like behaviors, novel object recognition memory (NORM), inhibitive avoidance performance, hippocampal, and PFC BDNF expression were examined. The plasma corticosterone level of all groups was also evaluated. RESULTS: Results showed increased plasma corticosterone levels, stress-induced deficits in the NORM and IA tests, and increased anxiety-like behaviors. EE and RJ improved these deficits with a decline in serum corticosterone and also increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus and PFC in stressed ones. CONCLUSION: The EE and the RJ prevented the detrimental effects of stress on anxiety-like behaviors and memory processes. These treatments can protect susceptible brain areas against chronic stress via improvement in behavioral and cognitive impairments through mediating BDNF expression.",
