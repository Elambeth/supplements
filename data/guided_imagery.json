      "abstract": "Background: Multiple sclerosis can cause walking and balance disorders. These complications cause extensive disturbances in the quality of life, independence, and self-care and affect many aspects of their lives. The guided imagery method is a simple, easy, and safe intervention. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effect of guided imagery on walking and balance dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis in 2023. Sixty-six patients were randomly divided into two intervention and control groups (n = 33). The intervention group listened to the audio file of nature-based guided imagery, and the control group did not receive any intervention. Data were collected by 6-min walk test, 25-ft walk test, and Berg balance scale before and after the intervention. Analysis of the average results of movement disorder and balance intra- and intergroup, before and after the study, was done with a paired t-test, independent t-test, and analysis of covariance. The significance level in all tests is 0.05, with a confidence level of 95%. Results: After performing guided imagery, in the intervention group, walking dysfunction significantly improved, with changes from 429.55 ± 42.78 to 459.24 ± 41.48 in the 6-min walk test, 7.12 ± 0.37 to 6.74 ± 0.44 in the 25-ft walk test, and the improvement of balance level with changes of 26.60 ± 3.13 to 31.72 ± 3.64 in the Berg balance test. Conclusion: Using guided imagery can improve walking dysfunction and balance in patients with multiple sclerosis. Trial Registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials: IRCT20220614055170N1.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Imagery as a psychological skill in sports occupies an essential place in the psychological preparation of athletes and is one of the key factors in realizing an athlete's potential in competitive sports. It's role in athlete performance, as well as the differences in its use across various sports and demographic groups, has been a compelling topic in both sports' science and psychology. This topic has remained relevant in recent years. AIM: This quantitative survey-based and experimental design study aims to first, to determine whether differences in imagery ability profiles, identified through cluster analysis, can characterize differences among athletes with varying levels of athletic achievement. A secondary aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a guided imagery intervention on imagery abilities and athletic performance. METHODS: A total of 500 athletes from different sports, aged M = 21.01 (SD = 2.82), both male and female, completed the Sport Imagery Ability Questionnaire (SIAQ) and provided information regarding their demographics and athletic achievements. In the experimental part of the study, nine alpine skiers were selected to participate in a six-month guided imagery intervention alongside their regular trainings on the ski track to assess the intervention's impact on performance. RESULTS: The results of K-means cluster analysis on athletic achievements of athletes showed a four-cluster solution that hat emphasized distinctions between the groups and reduced variation within each group. A Multiple Analysis of Covariance revealed that the four cluster groups differ in their imagery abilities. Pre- and post-intervention assessments for the nine alpine skiers were conducted using SIAQ and control training sessions, revealing significant increase in both imagery ability scores and performance indicators (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The research results support recent findings that athletes with higher athletic achievement tend to have stronger imagery abilities. The significant differences observed between the clusters based on athletic achievement levels were confirmed. By using imagery profiling of athletes with an analytical method, this study provides valuable insights into the role of imagery in athletic success, suggesting that tailored imagery training could enhance performance across different levels of athletic achievement."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that uses mental visualization to help individuals relax and focus their minds. This systematic review examines the effect of guided imagery on perioperative anxiety in hospitalized adult patients. The aim is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing evidence on the efficacy of guided imagery as an intervention for reducing perioperative anxiety. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO. After screening titles and abstracts, full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. The selected studies were analyzed for their findings related to the effect of guided imagery on perioperative anxiety in adult patients. RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and provided sufficient data for analysis. The majority of the included studies reported a statistically significant reduction in perioperative anxiety following guided imagery interventions. The variations in intervention protocols, such as the content, duration, and frequency of guided imagery, were observed across the studies. Patient satisfaction and acceptance of guided imagery interventions were generally high. CONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review suggest that guided imagery is an effective intervention for reducing perioperative anxiety in hospitalized adult patients. Despite the limitations of small sample sizes and variability in measurement tools, the consistent positive results and high patient satisfaction indicate the potential benefits of incorporating guided imagery into perioperative care protocols. More comprehensive research with bigger samples and standardized tools is essential for guiding imagery integration in clinical practice."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Eating disorders (ED) are characterized by serious and persistent disturbances with eating, weightcontrol, and body image. Symptoms impact physical health, psychosocial functioning, and can be life-threatening. Individuals diagnosed with an ED experience numerous medical and psychiatric comorbidities due to issues caused by or underlying the ED. Therefore, it is vital to address the complex nature of an ED, as well as the comorbid and underlying issues. This necessitates a psychotherapeutic approach that can help to uncover, explore, and support working through unresolved emotions and experiences. Guided Imagery and Music (GIM) is an in-depth music psychotherapy approach utilizing therapist-programmed music to support the client in uncovering and examining underlying and unresolved issues. The literature surrounding the use of GIM with clients in ED treatment is anecdotal and comprised primarily of clinical case studies. METHOD: This secondary analysis, based on a descriptive feasibility study that integrated GIM sessions into the client's regular ED treatment and examined 116 transcripts from a series of sessions of eight clients. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of the transcripts identified nine subthemes and three themes that emerged. These themes include emotional landscape (feeling stuck, acknowledging emotions, and working through unresolved emotions), relationships (self, others, and eating disorders), and transformation and growth (finding strength, change, and empowerment). A short series of GIM sessions helped ED clients identify and address issues underlying the ED and to gain or reclaim a sense of self that enabled them to make choices for their life that support their recovery and sense of empowerment. Intertextual analysis revealed imagery indicative of the Hero's Journey. DISCUSSION: Further, how engagement in this embodied aesthetic experience stimulates perceptual, cognitive, and affective brain functions which are key in fostering behavioural and psychological change is explicated as it relates to ED treatment and recovery."

This study aims to analyze the effect of the guided imagery technique on the patients' pain, anxiety, and sleep levels before and after a lumbar disk herniation (LDH) operation. DESIGN: This study was conducted as a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. METHODS: The research was conducted with 60 patients who underwent LDH surgery and met the inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into experimental and control groups according to a computer-generated randomization list. The treatment group (n = 31) applied guided imagery techniques twice, once in the preoperative and postoperative periods. The control group (n = 29) was provided with routine care. \"Introductory Information Form,\" \"Surgery-Specific Anxiety Scale,\" \"Richard-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire,\" and \"Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)\" were used. The data were analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, paired sample t test, independent sample t test, Pearson chi-square exact test, and repeated measures two-way analysis of variance. In all results, P < .05 was considered statistically significant. FINDINGS: The preoperative anxiety level of the treatment group was lower compared to the anxiety level of the control group (P < .05). The sleep score of the treatment group in the preoperative period was higher than the sleep score of the control group (P < .05). The sleep score of the treatment group in the postoperative period was found to be higher than the sleep score of the control group (P < .05). The pain average of the treatment group in the postoperative period was lower than the pain average of the control group (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study results revealed that guided imagery applied in the preoperative and postoperative periods effectively decreased pain and anxiety levels and increased the sleep quality of patients with LDH.",

This study assessed the prevalence and 20 year trends in the use of these practices in US adults between 2002-2022. We examined practice use and associations with sociodemographic and health factors in a population-weighted analysis of n = 134,959 participants across 5 cycles of the National Health Interview Survey. The overall use of meditation (18.3%, 60.53 million), yoga (16.8%, 55.78 million) and guided imagery/progressive relaxation (6.7%, 22.22 million) increased significantly from 2002 to 2022. Growth was consistent across most sociodemographic and health strata, however users of 'Other' race (comprising 54% Indigenous Americans, Odds Ratios; ORs = 1.28-1.70) and users with moderate (ORs = 1.19-1.29) psychological distress were overrepresented across all practices, and those with severe psychological distress were overrepresented in meditation (OR = 1.33) and guided imagery/progressive relaxation (OR = 1.42). Meditation use has accelerated over time for 65 + year olds (OR = 4.22), people not accessing mental health care (OR = 1.39), and less educated (OR = 4.02) groups, potentially reflecting unmet health needs. Health professionals should consider the extensive use of complementary practices in service and treatment planning and consider their risks and benefits.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: There has been an increasing interest in the use of non-pharmacological approaches for the multidimensional treatment of chronic pain. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapies and Guided Imagery (GI) interventions in managing chronic non-cancer pain and related outcomes. Materials and Methods: Searching three electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus) and following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was performed on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and pilot RCTs investigating mindfulness or GI interventions in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was utilized to assess the quality of the evidence, with outcomes encompassing pain intensity, opioid consumption, and non-sensorial dimensions of pain. Results: Twenty-six trials met the inclusion criteria, with most of them exhibiting a moderate to high risk of bias. A wide diversity of chronic pain types were under analysis. Amongst the mindfulness interventions, and besides the classical programs, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) emerges as an approach that improves interoception. Six trials demonstrated that mindfulness techniques resulted in a significant reduction in pain intensity, and three trials also reported significant outcomes with GI. Evidence supports a significant improvement in non-sensory dimensions of pain in ten trials using mindfulness and in two trials involving GI. Significant effects on opioid consumption were reported in four mindfulness-based trials, whereas one study involving GI found a small effect with that variable. Conclusions: This study supports the evidence of benefits of both mindfulness techniques and GI interventions in the management of chronic non-cancer pain. Regarding the various mindfulness interventions, a specific emphasis on the positive results of MORE should be highlighted. Future studies should focus on specific pain types, explore different durations of the mindfulness and GI interventions, and evaluate emotion-related outcomes.",

Previous feedback from child/caregiver dyads suggested modifications for our App prototype. However, their feedback had the potential to affect the intervention's efficacy. Thus, we aimed to have their critiques vetted by relevant experts prior to further App refinement. OBJECTIVE: Compare expert reviews of the GIT App with end-users' (i.e., child/caregiver dyads') feedback. METHODS: This mixed-methods study with experts included a hands-on App evaluation, a survey assessing usability, and focus groups comparing their perspectives with those previously provided by end-users. RESULTS: Eight medical and technology experts were enrolled. Their average usability survey score of the GIT App was 69.0 ± 27.7, which was marginally above the 50th percentile. While the expert and end-user usability assessments were generally favorable, both groups agreed that the App's reminder notification feature location was not intuitive, detracting from its usability. Experts agreed with end-users that the App's aesthetics were acceptable and suggested increasing icon and font sizes. Like the end-users, the experts did not achieve consensus regarding the ideal session length or inclusion of background sounds and screen animations. Lastly, the experts agreed with end-users that gamification techniques (e.g., gift cards and virtual badges) would promote user engagement. CONCLUSION: An expert review of our therapeutic App revealed findings consistent with end-users and provided insight for modifying the interface and GIT sessions. Based on this experience, we recommend expert vetting of end-user suggestions as a routine checkpoint when developing therapeutic Apps."

This study aimed to determine the effect of GIM on the level of sexual function in women with sexual dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cluster randomized trial, which was conducted from 2018 to 2019 in the randomly selected comprehensive health centers of Isfahan, Iran, 72 women of reproductive age (two groups of 36 people) with sexual dysfunction were selected by convenience sampling method, and then, music-guided imagination was performed on the intervention group. No special intervention was performed in the control group. Data collection tools were demographic characteristics questionnaire and a standard questionnaire of the female sexual function index. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in sexual function and demographic characteristics before the intervention between the two groups (P = 0/301). The results demonstrated that the overall score of sexual function in the intervention subjects was better than the control group (P = 0/003). Improvement of sexual function dimensions (desire, arousal, orgasm) was also significant in the intervention group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: GIM can be effective in improving women's sexual function. Providing this technique as a low-cost and affordable method is recommended to health experts in private and government clinics. This method can improve the mental health of the family and society."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental images of feared events are overactive and intrusive in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Imagery rescripting involves integration of positive or neutral imagery and corrective information into images to facilitate emotional processing, reduce imagery intrusions, and re-structure underlying schema. Yet only one known study has applied the technique to treatment of worry. The present study aimed first to examine the relationship between trait worry and properties of future-oriented worry images, and second to examine the efficacy of a self-guided imagery rescripting intervention in improving individuals' response to their worries. METHODS: Participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 365) identified their major worry and wrote the script of a worst-case scenario mental image. Participants were randomized to three conditions: re-writing the same worry image script (exposure), or writing scripts of either one or three positive alternative future-oriented images (rescripting conditions). RESULTS: In preliminary analyses, trait worry negatively predicted participants' ratings of worry images, including valence and ability to cope, and positively predicted distress, anticipated cost, and belief in their negative meaning. In experimental analyses, linear mixed-effects models revealed anxious response and cognitive appraisal of the threat were significantly lower among participants allocated to rescripting relative to exposure. There was no effect of rescripting type. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation demonstrated the impact of a future-oriented imagery rescripting task on anxiety and cognitive biases associated with real worries in an unselected sample. Results may contribute to the development of imagery rescripting interventions for GAD.",

      "abstract": "Background: Patients with life-limiting illnesses receiving palliative care have a high symptom burden that can be challenging to manage. Guided imagery (GI), a complementary and integrative therapy in which patients are induced to picture mental images with sensory components, has proven in quasi-experimental studies to be effective as a complementary therapy for symptom management. Objective: To systematically review randomized controlled trials that report evidence of guided imagery for symptom management in patients with life-limiting illnesses. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline was followed for this review and the search strategy was applied in Medline, CINHAL, and Web of Science. The quality of articles was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk-of-Bias Tool 2 (RoB 2). The results are presented using the Guidance on the Conduct of Narrative Synthesis in Systematic Reviews. Results: A total of 8822 studies were initially identified through the search strategy, but after applying exclusion criteria, 14 randomized controlled trials were included in this review. The quality assessment revealed that four studies had a high risk of bias, nine had some concerns, and one had a low risk of bias. Out of the 14 studies, 6 evaluated oncological diagnosis, while the remaining 8 focused on nononcological diagnoses across 6 different diseases. GI was found to be effective in managing symptoms in 10 out of the 14 studies. Regardless of the disease stage, patients who received guided imagery experienced relief from anxiety, depression, pain, sleep disturbances, and fatigue. Conclusion: GI therapy has shown promising results regarding symptom management in palliative care patients with life-limiting illnesses at different stages.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Empirical evidence has shown that virtual reality (VR) scenarios can increase the effects of relaxation techniques, reducing anxiety by enabling people to experience emotional conditions in more vivid settings. OBJECTIVE: This pilot randomized controlled study aims to investigate whether the progressive muscle relaxation technique (PMRT) associated with a personalized scenario in VR promotes psychological well-being and facilitates the recall of relaxing images more than the standard complementary intervention that involves the integration of PMRT and guided imagery (GI). METHODS: On the basis of a longitudinal, between-subject design, 72 university students were randomly exposed to one of two experimental conditions: (1) standard complementary procedure (PMRT and GI exposure) and (2) experimental procedure (PMRT and personalized VR exposure). Individuals were assessed by a therapist before and after 7 training sessions based on measures investigating anxiety, depression, quality of life, coping strategies, sense of presence, engagement, and side effects related to VR exposure. Heart rate data were also collected. RESULTS: Differences in changes between the 2 groups after the in vivo PMRT session conducted by the psychotherapist (T1) were statistically significant for state anxiety (F1,67=30.56; P<.001) and heart rate (F1,67=4.87; P=.01). Individuals in the VR group obtained lower scores both before (t67=-2.63; P=.01; Cohen d=0.91) and after (t67=-7.23; P<.001; Cohen d=2.45) the relaxation session when it was self-administered by participants (T2). A significant reduction in perceived state anxiety at T1 and T2 was observed for both groups (P<.001). After the VR experience, individuals reported feeling higher engagement in the experience than what was mentioned by participants in the GI group (F1,67=2.85; P=.03; ηp2=0.15), and they experienced the environment as more realistic (F1,67=4.38; P=.003; ηp2=0.21). No differences between groups regarding sense of presence were found (F1,67=1.99; P=.11; ηp2=0.11). Individuals exposed before to the VR scenario (T1) referred to perceiving the scenario recalled in-imagination at T2 as more realistic than what those in the GI group experienced (F1,67=3.21; P=.02; ηp2=0.12). The VR group had lower trait anxiety levels than the GI group after the relaxation session during session 7 (T2; t67=-2.43; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized relaxing VR scenarios can contribute to improving relaxation and decreasing anxiety when integrated with PMRT as a complementary relaxation method.

Being conscious during the interventions performed with local anesthesia can lead to anxiety and stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of guided imagery performed before and during the procedure on vital signs and comfort, pain, anxiety, and satisfaction levels in patients with cancer undergoing port catheterization with local anesthesia. METHODS: A total of 80 patients were included in the study. Patients in the intervention group received standard treatment and nursing care, as well as a guided imagery intervention once before and once during the procedure. Patients in the control group received only standard treatment and nursing care. RESULTS: Patients in the guided imagery group reported lower pain and anxiety scores, higher patient satisfaction, and increased comfort compared with patients in the control group. Patients in the guided imagery group showed significantly lower respiratory rate and heart rate than the control group by the end of the procedure. There was no significant difference in blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Practicing guided imagery before and during a procedure performed under local anesthesia reduced cancer patients' pain, increased patient satisfaction and comfort, and had a positive effect on their respiratory and heart rates. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: We recommend guided imagery as a practical, low-cost complementary therapy for patients receiving local anesthesia.",

We examined the effects of the online-delivered guided imagery relaxation (GIR) technique on the stress and well-being of primary school children. METHODS: Thirty-four (N = 34) 11-year-old students were randomly assigned to either intervention (n = 17) or waitlist-control (n = 17) groups. The participants from the intervention group were required to attend a 4-week online GIR session and practice the techniques daily for 5 min-10 min. The Stress in Children (SiC) questionnaire, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Parent Reported (SDQ-PR) and tracking form were administered pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: Eleven (64.7%) participants attended all sessions and eight (47.0%) completed daily practices. Mixed-model ANOVA indicated no significant difference between participants from intervention and waitlist-control groups across pre- and post-intervention time points, with P-values greater than 0.05 for stress and well-being. CONCLUSION: Issues regarding online intervention, including managing children's activities from a distance, Internet connectivity, and time limitations might have affected their adherence and the research outcome. Nonetheless, the online-delivered GIR technique is a promising intervention modality. However, its implementation should be improvised to be more impactful."

A secondary aim was to suggest performance improvements regarding the protocol and the resources required to undertake a future larger scale study. The researchers randomized participants (n = 20) into two groups: Intervention group (n = 10) and Control group (n = 10). The Intervention group received a series of six individual, short GIM sessions whereas the Control group received two verbal counseling sessions that took place at Week 1 and at Week 6 of treatment. All participants in the study completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS-Brief); Cancer Fatigue Scale (CFS); and Herth Hope Index (HHI) before the beginning of Week 1 and again after Week 6 or, in the case of the Intervention group, after the last GIM session. All participants also completed two Visual Analogue Scales (VAS-Hope; VAS-Fatigue) weekly or after each session throughout the duration of the trial. The results of the Intervention group receiving GIM showed medium pre-post effect sizes for the CFS, HHI, and POMS questionnaires, and significant positive changes for the VAS-H and VAS-F questionnaires. As seen from this initial data outcome, a brief series of GIM sessions shows promise to be beneficial for increasing hope, decreasing fatigue, and mitigating distressed mood for female patients undergoing treatment for breast or gynecologic cancer.",

      "abstract": "Background: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is characterized by widespread persistent musculoskeletal pain. Mostly prevalent among White women, little is known about FMS in other population cohorts. This study examined secondary data of a racially diverse sample of women with FMS that were collected as part of a randomized controlled clinical trial that examined the effect of a complementary therapy intervention over the course of a 10-week guided imagery intervention to identify demographic, social, or economic differences in self-reported pain. Materials and Methods: The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), which measures pain severity and interference, was administered to 72 women (21 Black and 51 Whites) at baseline, 6 and 10 weeks. Student's t tests and time series regression models examined racial difference in pain dimensions and treatment response. Regression models accounted for age, race, income, duration of symptoms, treatment group, pain at baseline, smoking, alcohol use, comorbid conditions, and time. Results: Black women experienced significantly higher pain severity (β = 5.52, standard deviation [SD] = 2.13) and interference (β = 5.54, SD = 2.74) than Whites (severity β = 4.56, SD = 2.08; interference β = 4.72, SD = 2.76) (interference: t = 1.92, p = 0.05; severity: t = 2.95, p = 0.00). Disparities persisted over time. Controlling for differences in age, income, and previous pain levels, Black women had 0.26 (standard error [SE] = 0.065) higher pain severity and 0.36 (SE = 0.078) higher interference than Whites. Low-income earners also experienced 2.02 (SE = 0.38) and 2.19 (SE = 0.46) higher pain severity and interference, respectively, than other earners. Results were robust to inclusion of comorbidities. Conclusions: Black women and low-income earners experienced significantly higher levels of pain severity and interference and a lower dose response to the intervention. Differentials were robust to inclusion of demographic, health, and behavioral characteristics. Findings suggest that external factors may contribute to pain perception among women with FMS.",

AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of brief GI on symptoms of chronic back pain in adults treated in the Rheumatology clinic. DESIGN: A-B design study. SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 35 women with chronic back pain were recruited at the Rheumatology Outpatient Clinic of Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, Israel. METHODS: All subjects completed questionnaires at recruitment (T1), and after 8-10 weeks, they completed questionnaires again before the first intervention (T2). The intervention included five brief GI group meetings every 2-3 weeks, one hour each (3-5 subjects per group). Participants learned 6 GI exercises and were asked to practice brief guided imagery exercises at least once daily. Then, questionnaires were completed the third time (T3). OUTCOME MEASURES: MOQ - Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire, STAI - State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, FABQ - Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, NPRS - Numerical Pain Rating Scale (average pain over the last week). RESULTS: Compared with the period without intervention, NPRS (Δ = 2.53, standard error [SE] = 0.43, p < .001), STAI (Δ = 8.41, SE = 1.95, p < .001), and MOQ (Δ = 0.06, SE = 0.02, p = .019) reported significantly lower levels after brief guided imagery training. However, no statistically significant change was found in FABQ. CONCLUSIONS: The brief guided imagery intervention may help alleviate chronic back pain, help decrease anxiety, and improve daily activity in women who suffer from chronic low back pain.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tobacco use continues to be a leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States, accounting for >480,000 deaths each year. Although treatments for tobacco use are effective for many, there is substantial variability in outcomes, and these approaches are not effective for all individuals seeking to quit smoking cigarettes. New, effective therapeutic approaches are needed to meet the preferences of people who want to stop smoking. Guided imagery (GI) is a mind-body technique that involves the guided visualization of specific mental images, which is enhanced with other sensory modalities and emotions. Preliminary evidence provides initial support for the use of GI as a treatment for cigarette smoking. Meta-analyses have shown that standard treatment for cigarette smoking delivered over the telephone via quitlines is effective. A telephone-based intervention that uses GI might provide another effective treatment option and increase the reach and effectiveness of quitlines. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the efficacy of Be Smoke Free, a telephone-delivered GI treatment for smoking cessation. METHODS: This multisite randomized clinical trial (RCT) will compare a novel telephone-delivered GI tobacco cessation treatment with a standard evidence-based behavioral treatment. The study will be conducted over 5 years. In phase 1, we refined protocols and procedures for the New York State and West Virginia sites for use in the RCT. During phase 2, we will conduct an RCT with 1200 participants: 600 (50%) recruited via quitlines and 600 (50%) recruited via population-based methods. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the GI condition or the behavioral condition; both treatments will be delivered by trained study coaches located at the University of Arizona. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 3 and 6 months after enrollment by University of Arizona research staff. The primary outcome will be self-reported 30-day point prevalence abstinence 6 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes include biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence 6 months after enrollment. RESULTS: Recruitment in West Virginia and New York began in October 2022. As of March 31, 2023, a total of 242 participants had been enrolled. Follow-up assessments began in November 2022. As of March 31, 2023, of the 118 eligible participants, 97 (82.2%) had completed the 3-month assessment, and 93% (26/28) of eligible participants had completed the 6-month assessment. Biochemical verification and qualitative interviews began in April 2023. Recruitment will continue through 2025 and follow-up assessments through 2026. Primary results are expected to be published in 2027. CONCLUSIONS: The Be Smoke Free study is a first-of-its-kind RCT that incorporates GI into telephone-based tobacco cessation treatment. If successful, Be Smoke Free will have substantial benefits for the long-term health of people who use tobacco across the United States.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) are highly prevalent and associated with substantial morbidity. Guided imagery therapy (GIT) is efficacious; however, barriers often impede patient access. Therefore, we developed a GIT mobile app as a novel delivery platform. OBJECTIVE: Guided by user-centered design, this study captured the critiques of our GIT app from children with FAPDs and their caregivers. METHODS: Children aged 7 to 12 years with Rome IV-defined FAPDs and their caregivers were enrolled. The participants completed a software evaluation, which assessed how well they executed specific app tasks: opening the app, logging in, initiating a session, setting the reminder notification time, and exiting the app. Difficulties in completing these tasks were tallied. After this evaluation, the participants independently completed a System Usability Scale survey. Finally, the children and caregivers were separately interviewed to capture their thoughts about the app. Using a hybrid thematic analysis approach, 2 independent coders coded the interview transcripts using a shared codebook. Data integration occurred after the qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed, and the collective results were summarized. RESULTS: We enrolled 16 child-caregiver dyads. The average age of the children was 9.0 (SD 1.6) years, and 69% (11/16) were female. The System Usability Scale average scores were above average at 78.2 (SD 12.6) and 78.0 (SD 13.5) for the children and caregivers, respectively. The software evaluation revealed favorable usability for most tasks, but 75% (12/16) of children and 69% (11/16) of caregivers had difficulty setting the reminder notification. The children's interviews confirmed the app's usability as favorable but noted difficulty in locating the reminder notification. The children recommended adding exciting scenery and animations to the session screen. Their preferred topics were animals, beaches, swimming, and forests. They also recommended adding soft sounds related to the session topic. Finally, they suggested that adding app gamification enhancements using tangible and intangible rewards for listening to the sessions would promote regular use. The caregivers also assessed the app's usability as favorable but verified the difficulty in locating the reminder notification. They preferred a beach setting, and theme-related music and nature sounds were recommended to augment the session narration. App interface suggestions included increasing the font and image sizes. They also thought that the app's ability to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms and gamification enhancements using tangible and intangible incentives would positively influence the children's motivation to use the app regularly. Data integration revealed that the GIT app had above-average usability. Usability challenges included locating the reminder notification feature and esthetics affecting navigation. CONCLUSIONS: Children and caregivers rated our GIT app's usability favorably, offered suggestions to improve its appearance and session content, and recommended rewards to promote its regular use. Their feedback will inform future app refinements."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Alterations in diurnal salivary cortisol patterns have been linked to adverse metabolic health outcomes. We have previously shown that stress-reduction guided imagery (GI) can reduce salivary cortisol levels acutely. We now ask whether addition of GI into a 12-week lifestyle intervention designed to improve eating and physical activity behaviors can alter diurnal salivary cortisol patterns and perceived stress. METHODS: 232 adolescent participants (ages 14-17 years) were cluster randomized by school into one of four intervention arms: non-intervention Control (C; n = 51), Lifestyle (LS; n=61), Stress-Reduction GI (SRGI; n = 55), and Lifestyle Behavior GI (LBGI; n = 65). LS group received one nutrition and one physical activity class per week after-school for 12 weeks. SRGI and LBGI groups received same LS classes plus an additional weekly GI session. Salivary cortisol was assessed pre- and post-intervention on 3 days, 3 times daily, at awakening, 30-minutes post-awakening, and in the evening to determine Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and Diurnal Cortisol Slope (DCS). Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was administered pre- and post-intervention. Mixed effects modeling was used for intent-to-treat analysis and sensitivity analysis was used for those participants adherent to intervention protocol. RESULTS: Analysis of 208 subjects with complete data showed a small between-group increase in CAR in LBGI vs C (p = 0.045, d=0.24), with no significant group differences among other intervention arms. There were no between group differences in change in DCS or change in PSS after 12-weeks. Amongst adherent participants, LBGI showed a small-moderate increase in CAR (p = 0.03, d=0.37), and moderate-large reduction in PSS (p = 0.02, d=-0.66) compared to C. There were no other between group differences in CAR, DCS, or PSS. CONCLUSION: LBGI led to an increase in CAR, and in adherent subjects, a decrease in PSS, suggesting GI may be a mind-body intervention that can affect both objective and subjective measures of the stress response. Whether changes in cortisol patterns in this population affect measures of mental or physical health remains to be determined.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with advanced cancer often experience high levels of debilitating pain and pain-related psychological distress. Although there is increasing evidence that non-pharmacological interventions are needed to manage their pain, pharmacologic modalities remain the preferred treatment . Guided imagery is a form of focused relaxation that helps create harmony between the mind and body and has been shown to significantly improve cancer pain. Our study presents Virtual Reality Assisted Guided Imagery (VRAGI) as a complementary treatment modality to manage chronic pain in patients with cancer. We will conduct a randomised controlled trial to test its impact on patients with advanced cancer in a home setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will recruit 80 patients from Prisma Health, a tertiary-level healthcare centre based in Greenville, South Carolina, USA. The prospective 2×2 randomised controlled trial will randomise participants into four groups: (1) VRAGI, (2) laptop-assisted guided imagery, (3) VR (no guided imagery) and (4) laptop (no guided imagery). Patients allocated to VR groups will be trained to use a head-mounted display that immerses them in 3D audio-video content. The non-VR group will use a laptop displaying 2D video content. We will collect measures before and during the 3-week intervention as well as 3 weeks after the intervention ends. Measures will include patient-reported outcomes of pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue in addition to opioid use. The primary objective of the current study is to assess the efficacy of VRAGI on pain in the home setting. The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of VRAGI on opioid use, anxiety, depression and fatigue. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Prisma Health Institutional Review Board (#Pro00114598) in November 2021. All participants enrolled in the study will provide written informed consent. Dissemination will be through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

      "abstract": "The psychedelic drug psilocybin has been successfully explored as a novel treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders. Administration of psilocybin requires careful attention to psychological support and the setting in which the drug is administered. The use of music to support the acute psychoactive effects of psilocybin is recommended in current guidelines, but descriptions of how to compile music programs for the 4-6 h long sessions are still scarce. This article describes the procedural steps and considerations behind the curation of a new music program, the Copenhagen Music Program, tailored to the intensity profile of a medium/high dose psilocybin. The method of Guided Imagery and Music is presented as a music therapeutic framework for choosing and sequencing music in music programming and the Taxonomi of Therapeutic Music is presented as a rating tool to evaluate the music-psychological intensity of music pieces. Practical examples of how to organize the process of music programming are provided along with a full description of the Copenhagen Music Program and its structure. The aim of the article is to inspire others in their endeavours to create music programs for psychedelic interventions, while proposing that an informed music choice may support the therapeutic dynamics during acute effects of psilocybin."

Although progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery have been reported to improve emotional and physical health, the use of such approaches among nursing students rarely exist. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the deferential effects of progressive muscle relaxation [PMR] and guided imagery [GI] on physical and emotional symptoms in nursing students taking their initial clinical training. METHODS: Using a three-group, randomized, single blinded study conducted in a large Jordanian university, 156 nursing students were randomly allocated into one of three study groups (PMR group, GI group, and control group). The physical symptoms and emotional symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at baseline and end of the intervention. The study protocol was registered in ClinicalTrail.gov, identifier: xxxxxx. RESULTS: Using one-way MANOVA and post-hoc comparisons, the results showed that PMR and GI significantly reduced more physical symptoms than control condition although PMR was more effective than GI in this regard. GI significantly decreased more emotional symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and stress than PMR and control condition. PMR decreased anxiety, depression, and stress but the results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study support the ABC relaxation theory claiming that PMR im-proves better physical symptoms while GI improves better emotional symptoms. However, further studies using students from multiple settings are needed."

METHODS: This was a randomized crossover trial with 50 cancer patients on active chemotherapy treatment, who were randomized to one of two treatment sequences VR-GI or GI-VR. Patients were assessed for Mood Changes, using POMS questionnaire, for three symptoms (Nausea, Pain and Feeling Sick), using three questions from FACT-G questionnaire, and Bio-physical parameters (Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Oxygen Saturation). Linear Mixed Effect Models were used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Patients experienced a better effect of mood state, for all the sub-scales of mood, after the VR intervention compared to GI, regardless of the sequence (p < 0⋅05). No effectiveness was found for Nausea, Pain and Feeling Sick symptoms. Statistically significant improvements were found on the Bio-physical parameters for the VR intervention (p < 0⋅05). CONCLUSION: VR intervention based on mood induction strategies is a feasible and effective procedure for promoting positive mood in cancer patients during chemotherapy. Ways to integrate such innovative technologies in clinical practice need to be explored by health care professionals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02392728.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancers of the head and neck region are associated with high symptom burden and elevated levels of psychological distress. Radiotherapy (RT) is a common treatment for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) that is associated with psychological distress related to the immobilizing nature of the treatment, frequency of treatment delivery, and side effects. Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that is beneficial in reducing psychological distress in patients with other cancer diagnoses but has not been studied in this patient population. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a brief guided imagery intervention (guided imagery for treatment, GIFT) to reduce RT-related anxiety and depression in patients with HNC relative to treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS: Patients with HNC planning to receive RT will be recruited to participate in a randomized controlled trial evaluating a brief, two-session guided imagery intervention (GIFT) relative to TAU alone. Primary aims include acceptability and feasibility evaluated through quantitative and qualitative methods. Measures of anxiety and depression, symptom burden, health-related quality of life, and anxiolytic medication use will be collected at baseline, during treatment, and at 1-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: There are no published interventions of guided imagery for anxiety and depression in patients with HNC despite its efficacy in other populations of patients with cancer. This proposed project evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention that has the potential to reduce psychological distress in a vulnerable population. Additionally, we will preliminarily examine the impact of behavioral intervention on psychological distress and the use of anxiolytic medication, a novel area of study.

AIM: To evaluate the effects of guided imagery meditation on ameliorating anxiety, improving the quality of sleep, and relieving postoperative pain in patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery. METHOD: In the general surgical ward of a teaching hospital, patients were randomly assigned to usual care (n = 34) and guided imagery meditation intervention (n = 34) groups, using the method. The measuring outcomes included their anxiety score, quality of sleep, and pain control. RESULTS: In terms of the anxiety difference, the experimental group scored 0.42 (standard deviation [SD] = 0.97), while the control group scored 4.79 (SD = 7.56), which indicates a statistically significant difference (F = 8.04, p = .01, partial eta2 = 0.11). In terms of quality of sleep, the mean score of the experimental group was 2.67 (SD = 1.96), while the control group scored 7.55 (SD = 3.81), which indicates a significant difference (F = 39.99, p = .001, partial eta2 = 0.39). The mean of the degree of postoperative pain was 2.11 points (SD = 1.39), and the score of the control group was 4.00 points (SD = 1.62), which indicates a significant difference (p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Guided imagery meditation is a simple, non-invasive, non-pharmacologic intervention measure. It can reduce anxiety and postoperative pain, and improve the quality of sleep. Thus, it should be promoted in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Future-directed thinking (FDT) is associated with goal directed behaviour and may differ in people with psychosis compared to non-clinical controls. This study investigated whether guided imagery could enhance positive FDT in people with psychosis. METHOD: Participants were 44 people experiencing a first episode of psychosis. They were assessed for negative and positive symptoms, FDT on the Future Thinking Task (FTT), depression, anxiety, autobiographical memory, verbal fluency and spontaneous use of imagery. They were randomised to either a positive or neutral imagery condition, before being retested on the FTT. Outcomes on the FTT were number of events generated, anticipated likelihood, anticipated affect and a composite score. RESULTS: Participants in the positive imagery condition generated significantly more positive events on the FTT compared with those in the neutral (F (1, 42) = 19.916, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.322). In both imagery conditions, likelihood ratings of positive events increased post-intervention. Positive and negative events were both perceived as less likely to occur the further into the future they were, and positive events were anticipated to be more positive and negative events more negative, the further into the future they were. LIMITATIONS: The participants in this study experienced relatively low levels of symptoms, and therefore caution should be used when applying these results to people with greater symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: Positive guided imagery shows promise for enhancing positive FDT in people with first-episode psychosis. This intervention may offer a simple and effective method of enhancing engagement with the future, with potential implications for goal-directed behaviour.",

METHODS: This clinical trial is a double-blind study that was conducted on 60 patients with multiple sclerosis referred to the largest center for special diseases in the southeast of Iran in 2020. The convenience sampling method was used to select the participants who were later divided into two groups of intervention (n = 30) and control (n = 30) using block randomization method. The intervention group listened to the guided imagery audio file at home for 25 min. The control group did not receive any intervention. Data were collected by demographic information questionnaires, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Reece Stigma Scale for Multiple Sclerosis (RSS-MS), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) before and one month after the intervention. RESULTS: According to the results, there was no significant difference between the two groups before the intervention in terms of the score of fatigue (P < 0.0 = 67), stigma (P < 0.64), and mood (P < 0.17). However, after the intervention, a significant differences was observed in this regard (P < 0.0001). In the intervention group, the mean score of fatigue decreased from 59.72 ± 18.32 to 35.8 ± 16.15, and the mean score of stigma decreased from 17.31 ± 15.62 to 5.09 ± 8.06, showing a significant reduction in the levels of fatigue (P < 0.0001) and stigma (P < 0.0001) compared to before intervention. Also, the mean score of mood decreased from 36.90 ± 12.21 to 28.55 ± 11.87, indicating an improvement in the mood of samples in the intervention group (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that guided imagery, as a cost-effective method, can decrease the fatigue and stigma, and enhance the mood of patients with MS. Therefore, nursing staff can use this method to improve MS patients' mood and decrease their fatigue and stigma.",

OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate the effectiveness of guided imagery (GI) versus virtual reality (VR) on the procedural pain and state anxiety of children and young adults undergoing unsedated procedures. We explored the role of trait anxiety and pain catastrophizing in intervention response. METHODS: Children and young adults were recruited from the hematology, oncology, and blood and marrow transplant clinics at a children's hospital. Each study participant completed the GI and VR intervention during separate but consecutive unsedated procedures. Self-report measures of pain and anxiety were completed before and after the procedures. RESULTS: A total of 50 participants (median age 13 years) completed both interventions. GI and VR performed similarly in the management of procedural pain. Those with high pain catastrophizing reported experiencing less nervousness about pain during procedures that used VR than those using GI. State anxiety declined pre- to postprocedure in both interventions; however, the decrease reached the level of significance during the VR intervention only. Those with high trait anxiety had less pain during GI. CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, VR worked as well as GI to manage the pain and distress associated with common procedures experienced by children with acute or chronic illnesses. Children who are primed for pain based on beliefs about pain or because of their history of chronic pain had a better response to VR. GI was a better intervention for those with high trait anxiety.

METHOD: Following an exploratory descriptive design, we conducted qualitative interviews with 10 healthcare professionals who care for patients with mental illness and subjected the collected data to thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported that SIM had helped them to manage countertransference and had prompted changes that we categorized into three themes: managing personal vulnerability, setting clearer boundaries, and practicing self-care. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that by cultivating wellbeing and dealing with unresolved inner conflicts, SIM can help healthcare professionals to manage countertransference."

STUDY DESIGN: 111 adolescent participants (94% Latino), a subset from a large, randomized controlled lifestyle intervention to improve obesity-related health behaviors, received either 4 weekly lifestyle education sessions (Lifestyle group; LS) or the same weekly lifestyle education sessions plus an additional weekly stress-reduction guided imagery session delivered in group format (Guided imagery group; GI). Salivary cortisol, salivary amylase, and self-reported stress moods were assessed before and after sessions on intervention weeks 3 and 4. Statistics: Linear mixed effects models examined within- and between-session and group differences in pre- to post-session changes. RESULTS: Both groups showed decreases in salivary cortisol, 5% decrease in LS group and 32% in GI group (within-group differences all P < .05), with between-group difference in salivary cortisol of moderate size (P = .05; Cohen's d = .44). Within the GI group alone, salivary cortisol decrease was similar following either the lifestyle or GI sessions (P = .64). There were no statistically significant amylase changes within or between groups. All 5 individual stress moods declined by 27% to 46% in the GI group (all P < .05), while only 1 of the 5 declined in LS group. CONCLUSIONS: Group stress-reduction guided imagery reduces the stress biomarker salivary cortisol, as well as reducing subjective stress mood states, making it a viable modality for large scale stress-reduction interventions."

Although there is evidence for the method's general effectiveness, it is yet unclear under which conditions and for which patients it should be used. The aim of this study was therefore to empirically identify indication criteria for the use of guided affective imagery (GAI) as part of psychodynamic therapies. We conducted semi-structured interviews with N=15 psychodynamic therapists also qualified as GAI training therapists. We asked them to recollect cases in which they had decided either for or against the use of imagery. The therapists described a complex interplay of different factors. Using grounded theory coding supplemented by elements of Consensual Qualitative Research we reconstructed from their accounts a sequential model of their indicative decisions. First, there is a consideration of clear contraindications related to reality testing and destructiveness. Second, there are aspects requiring a modified application of GAI such as emotional instability and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. In a final step, there are a number of characteristics of the patient, the therapist, the therapeutic relationship, the patients' initial imagery and different therapeutic goals and foci which are weighed relatively to each other in order for therapists to reach an indication decision. We end by discussing ways in which the indicative decision model may be used to improve GAI training as well as the method's differential efficacy and effectiveness."

      "abstract": "Physical activity offers substantial mind-body health benefits and reduced mortality, yet many individuals are chronically underactive. Physical activity interventions may benefit from integrative approaches that join components of mindfulness and neurobiological models of behavior. Mindfulness increases one's awareness of cognitions and physical sensations to potentially facilitate self-regulation, while neurobiological models such as the dual system model of health behavior offer guidance on improving physical activity intervention targets. This 2-phase study includes an initial development process to create brief (∼4 min) mindfulness informed guided imagery audio files that target distinct cognitive and affective processes to promote physical activity. In the second phase, participants completed a 2-week pilot intervention study to gather qualitative and quantitative data on intervention feasibility and acceptability. Participants endorsed the mindfulness informed guided imagery as easy to use, enjoyable and helpful. Over a 2-week intervention period participants reported positive shifts in behavior change, physical activity enjoyment, increased mindfulness during physical activity, and increased physical exercise self-efficacy and satisfaction. Interview data revealed that participants increased their frequency of physical activity and tended to experience positive affect during physical activity, engaged in future oriented thinking and were able to view physical activity in a more positive light. Findings support the feasibility and acceptability of an integrative online mindfulness informed guided imagery intervention to promote physical activity enjoyment and engagement. This study extends health behavior change intervention research and provides supporting evidence for a flexible and tailorable online mindfulness-based intervention."

      "abstract": "Pain and anxiety caused by burn dressing change are one of the major issues in burn patients. In this regard, guided imagery as a complementary method can be effective in reducing the levels of anxiety and pain. This method is the process of creating mental images and using sensory features through the individual's imagination and memory that facilitate the achievement of desired therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the effect of guided imagery on the quality and severity of pain and pain-related anxiety associated with dressing change in burn patients. This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial in which a total of 70 burn patients were enrolled using convenience sampling and randomly allocated to two groups of intervention and control (n = 35 in each group). Each patient in the intervention group received four sessions of guided imagery during four consecutive days (one session a day) using a headphone. Then in both groups, the level of pain was assessed after the dressing change and the level of pain-related anxiety was assessed before the dressing change (between the end of the intervention and the initiation of dressing change). Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), and the Burn Specific Pain Anxiety Scale (BSPAS). Data were first entered into the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25.0 and then analyzed using repeated-measures Analysis of Variance. The repeated measures ANOVA indicated the mean score of the quality and severity of pain and pain-related anxiety differed statistically and significantly after the intervention (during the four sessions) compared to before it (baseline) in the intervention group (p < 0.001). The independent-samples t-test indicated a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of the quality and severity of pain and pain-related anxiety between the two groups (p < 0.001). This difference was found to be significant from the second session onwards (p < 0.001). Medical staff, including physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals, are responsible for developing strategies to manage complications of burn injuries. Considering the effectiveness of guided imagery in reducing anxiety and pain in burn patients, it is recommended to use this method of complementary medicine to manage stress, anxiety, and pain in these patients.",

OBJECTIVE: We describe results of the pilot feasibility study of the See Me Serene mHealth app. The app provides users with immersive, vivid, nature experiences to reduce stress and anxiety related to COVID-19 and other isolation. The goals of the study were to develop the See Me Serene app and test the feasibility and acceptability of study procedures, and explore the potential impact of the app on stress and anxiety. METHODS: We developed and tested the See Me Serene app and our study procedures for feasibility, and gathered preliminary data with a goal of 100 participants. The research was conducted in 2 phases: (1) development and internal testing of the app; and (2) feasibility and pilot testing with participants recruited online through earned media (eg, news stories), presentations at a university campus, and social media (eg, online sharing of earned media and presentations). The feasibility study employed a mixed methods, within-subjects, pre-/posttest design. At baseline and 30-day follow-up, we assessed stress-related variables via validated self-report measures and saliva samples for determination of cortisol concentrations. RESULTS: We met or surpassed all our feasibility benchmarks for recruitment (101 participants recruited), retention (91% [90/99] of 30-day assessment completed), and data collection (99 participants completed all baseline data; 85% [84/99] of salivary cortisol samples returned). Participants adhered to the intervention. On average, participants listened to 48.2 audio files over 30 days or approximately 1.6 audio files per day. Participants were satisfied with the app, with 87% (78/90) rating the app as helpful in dealing with stress and anxiety. The app showed the potential to reduce stress, anxiety, loneliness, and worry. We did not find significant differences (P=.41) in cortisol levels over time. Our findings suggest that future research is warranted to test the efficacy of the See Me Serene app with a representative, diverse sample. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for evidence-based and easily disseminable stress-reduction interventions. See Me Serene is a feasible intervention and has the potential to reduce stress related to COVID-19 and other forms of social isolation. More research on See Me Serene is warranted."

There is evidence to support the use of guided imagery to address these concerns during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to analyze the use and short-term outcomes of a multiple-behavior guided imagery intervention delivered through a mobile health (mHealth) application for pregnant women. METHODS: A single-arm, 5-week feasibility trial was conducted, and participants were instructed to listen to an audio file every day for 35 days on an mHealth application. Measurements included ongoing assessments of the participants' use of the guided imagery audio files and pre- and post-test measures of depression, anxiety, stress, physical activity, food cravings, and body image. Postintervention qualitative interviews were conducted to assess whether participants would continue to use guided imagery. RESULTS: Fifty-eight participants (mean age, 28.5 years) were enrolled from January to June of 2018. Cloud analytics data showed an average of 4.96 audio downloads per week with the Sleep and Relaxation file being the most widely used (mean weekly usage, 5.67) and reported favorite during follow-up interviews. Paired-sample t tests from pre- to post-test showed significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and stress, increased physical activity, and sedentary behavior along with some changes in body image. DISCUSSION: Future scalable guided imagery interventions are justified to test for efficacy. Guided imagery may also be delivered in person by health care providers or by using widely available technologies.",

METHODS: A quasi-experiment conducted in a Bone Marrow Transplantation Service of a public hospital in southern Brazil. From October 2019 to October 2020, forty-two adult participants who underwent transplantation were included, 35 in the intervention group and seven in the control group. A guided imagery intervention, with audio guiding the relaxation associated with nature images in 360º, was performed during the hospitalization period. Data were collected on the first day of hospitalization, on the transplantation day, during the neutropenia stage, and at pre-hospital discharge. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Neutropenia (FACT-N) were used to assess health-related quality of life, fatigue and neutropenia. Data were analyzed using the Generalized Linear Mixed Model for the evolution of the health-related quality of life assessments over time, considering the groups and stages. Pearson's correlation coefficient was adopted for the correlation analyses. RESULTS: Allogeneic transplantation was predominant: 28 (80%) in the intervention group and 5 (71.43%) in the control group. There were improvements in the health-related quality of life scores, although not significant. A significant difference was found among the stages (p <0.050) and a significant positive correlation (p <0.000) among the variables on general quality of life, additional concerns, fatigue and neutropenia in all stages. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation suffer changes in their quality of life. Interventions based on integrative practices emerge as an option to minimize them. <br />.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: To determine the effects of a novel lifestyle intervention combining lifestyle behavioral education with the complementary-integrative health modality of guided imagery (GI) on dietary and physical activity behaviors in adolescents. The primary aim of this study was to determine the incremental effects of the lifestyle education, stress reduction GI (SRGI), and lifestyle behavior GI (LBGI) components of the intervention on the primary outcome of physical activity lifestyle behaviors (sedentary behavior, light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity), as well as dietary intake behaviors, at the completion of the 12-week intervention. The authors hypothesized that the intervention would improve obesity-related lifestyle behaviors. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and thirty-two adolescent participants (aged 14-17 years, sophomore or junior year of high school) were cluster randomized by school into one of four intervention arms: nonintervention Control (C), Lifestyle education (LS), SRGI, and LBGI. After-school intervention sessions were held two (LS) or three (SRGI, LBGI) times weekly for 12 weeks. Physical activity (accelerometry) and dietary intake (multiple diet recalls) outcomes were assessed pre- and postintervention. Primary analysis: intention-to-treat (ITT) mixed-effects modeling with diagonal covariance matrices; secondary analysis: ad hoc subgroup sensitivity analysis using only those participants adherent to protocol. Results: ITT analysis showed that the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) increased in the LS group compared with C (p = 0.02), but there was no additional effect of GI. Among adherent participants, sedentary behavior was decreased stepwise relative to C in SRGI (d = -0.73, p = 0.004) > LBGI (d = -0.59, p = 0.04) > LS (d = -0.41, p = 0.07), and moderate + vigorous physical activity was increased in SRGI (d = 0.58, p = 0.001). Among adherent participants, the HEI was increased in LS and SRGI, and glycemic index reduced in LBGI. Conclusions: While ITT analysis was negative, among adherent participants, the Imagine HEALTH lifestyle intervention improved eating habits, reduced sedentary activity, and increased physical activity, suggesting that GI may amplify the role of lifestyle education alone for some key outcomes.

AIMS: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate the feasibility of a guided imagery intervention to change pain scores, anxiety scores, and opioid analgesia usage among hospitalized adults in an acute care setting. DESIGN: Quality improvement project using three measurements (baseline, 24 hours, and 48 hours). SETTINGS: Acute care hospital. PARTICIPANTS/SUBJECTS: Adult inpatients referred to an APRN-led pain management service. METHODS: The intervention was the use of a 30-minute guided imagery recording delivered via MP3 player which patients used twice daily. RESULTS: Limited changes were seen in pain scores, with no statistically significant results (p = .449). Statistically significant reductions were found in both anxiety scores (p < .001) and opioid analgesia usage (p = .043). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this quality improvement project support the impact of guided imagery on anxiety and opioid analgesia use. Changes in pain scores were not demonstrated in this project. Additional research with a rigorous design is needed to determine cause and effect conclusions. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The use of guided imagery as an adjunctive intervention for pain control may engage and empower the patient in self-care activities, which may have an impact on how care is perceived. Guided imagery is a low-cost, easily implemented approach that can be incorporated into patient care to reduce anxiety and, potentially, opioid analgesia use.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To date, no studies have used hypnosis to examine and manage the potential emotional causes of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the scientific field; therefore, we decided to compare the effectiveness of hypnoanalysis and guided imagery for determining and manage these emotional causes. METHODS: Fifteen participants with severe MS were included and assigned into 2 groups: hypnoanalysis and guided imagery. In the hypnoanalysis group, the participants underwent 10 hypnotic sessions to understand events related to the cause of the disease, which were restructured (the events were modified by adding the psychological resources that each involved person needed); in addition, other techniques were used to investigate the causes and solutions according to the participants' unconscious. The guided imagery group received 10 group sessions of body relaxation and guided imagery, which were recorded for practice at home. Outcome measures, namely, disability (the Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS), quality of life (QoL, measured with the SF-36) and number of relapses, were evaluated 4 months previous the intervention, at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months later. RESULTS: Hypnoanalysis revealed that stressful events and psychoemotional maladaptive patterns acted as causal, detonating, or aggravating factors of disease, and psychoemotional changes were the most frequent and varied solutions. No changes were observed in disability between the two groups. The guided imagery group showed an improvement in 2 subscales of QoL when compared with the hypnoanalysis group (which disappeared at the follow-up); this difference is probably due to the increased number of sessions and probably due to psychoemotional maladaptive patterns being more frequently mentioned than difficult circumstances in life and/or unsolved past events. However, the techniques used in hypnoanalysis were effective in understanding the potential emotional causes of MS, which showed high intra- and inter-participant consistency. CONCLUSIONS: The daily use of guided imagery overcame the restructuring of negative past events to improve QoL in patients with MS.

The aim of this research was to determine the effect of guided imagery along with breathing relaxation on sleep quality in elderly patients undergoing abdominal surgery. A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on 90 elderly patients undergoing abdominal surgery in 2 educational hospitals in 2018, Mashhad, Iran. The elderly patients with different abdominal surgical procedures were distributed to the wardrooms and then the rooms were randomly assigned into 2 groups. In the intervention group, the patients learned breathing relaxation the day before surgery and then an audiotape was provided to perform the guided imagery from the day before surgery for 5 days (twice) along with breathing relaxation. St Mary's Hospital Sleep Inventory was completed the night before, 48 hours and 96 hours after the surgery. Data analysis was done using SPSS 21 through analytical tests. Results of the test indicated that the score of sleep quality was significantly higher in the intervention group the night before surgery (P = .001). The total scores of sleep quality in the intervention group 48 and 96 hours after the surgery were significantly higher (P < .001). Based on results of generalized estimating equation model, the score of sleep quality for patients was 8.76 units higher in the intervention group than in the control group by controlling for the effects of time.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Refugees have an increased risk of developing mental health problems. There are insufficient psychosocial care structures to meet the resulting need for support. Stabilizing and guided imagery techniques have shown promising results in increasing traumatized refugees' emotional stabilization. If delivered via audio files, the techniques can be practiced autonomously and independent of time, space, and human resources or stable treatment settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the self-practice of stabilizing and guided imagery techniques via digital audio files for traumatized refugees living in a reception and registration center in Germany. METHODS: From May 2018 to February 2019, 42 traumatized refugees participated in our study. At T1, patients received digital audio files in English, French, Arabic, Farsi, Turkish, or Serbian for self-practice. Nine days later, at T2, a face-to-face interview was conducted. Two months after T2, a follow-up interview took place via telephone. RESULTS: At T2, about half of the patients reported the daily practice of stabilizing and guided imagery techniques. At follow-up, the average frequency of practice was once weekly or more for those experiencing worse symptoms. No technical difficulties were reported. According to T2 and follow-up statements, the techniques helped the patients dealing with arousal, concentration, sleep, mood, thoughts, empowerment, and tension. The guided imagery technique \"The Inner Safe Place\" was the most popular. Self-practice was impeded by postmigratory distress factors, like overcrowded accommodations. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that self-practice of stabilizing and guided imagery techniques via digital audio files was helpful to and well accepted by the assessed refugees. Even though postmigratory distress factors hampered self-practice, \"The Inner Safe Place\" technique was particularly well received. Overall, the self-practiced audio-based stabilizing and guided imagery techniques showed promising results among the highly vulnerable group of newly arrived traumatized refugees.",

Quitlines are effective, standard care approaches for tobacco cessation; however, utilization of quitlines is low. Using guided imagery-based interventions for smoking cessation may appeal to smokers who do not utilize traditional quitline services. This paper reports the development of program materials for a randomized controlled feasibility trial of a guided imagery-based smoking cessation intervention. The objective of the formative work was to ensure that program materials are inclusive of groups that are less likely to use quitlines, including men and racial/ethnic minority tobacco users. METHODS: A three-phase process was used to complete formative assessment: (1) integration of evidence-based cessation practices into program development; (2) iterative small group interviews (N = 46) to modify the program; and (3) pilot-testing the coaching protocol and study process among a small sample of smokers (N = 5). RESULTS: The Community Advisory Board and project consultants offered input on program content and study recruitment based on their knowledge of minority communities with whom they conduct outreach. Small group interview participants included members of underserved quitline populations (52.37% non-white; 55.56% men). Only 28.26% of participants had prior experience with guided imagery, but others described the use of similar mindfulness and meditation practices. Participant feedback was incorporated into program materials and protocols. DISCUSSION: Iteratively collected feedback and pilot testing influenced program content and delivery and informed study processes for a randomized controlled feasibility trial of a telephone-delivered, guided imagery-based intervention."

BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic pain and accompanied by fatigue, depression, sleep problems, decreased daily functioning, and a lack of energy, thus negatively impacting daily functions, mental and physical health, and quality of life. DESIGN: An exploratory, controlled trial. SETTING: The study was conducted at Clalit Health Services (CHS) Physiotherapy Institute, Jerusalem, Israel and approved by the CHS IRB (0015-com2-16). METHODS: Thirty-seven female patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia were alternatively allocated to an intervention group 1 (IG1) including 18 patients, or a control group (CG) including 19 patients. Following the first BGI trial, the 16 remaining participants in CG became intervention group 2 (IG2), and 13 patients completed the trial. OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients completed a Brief Pain Inventory pain questionnaire and an SF-36 satisfaction questionnaire, before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The findings of this study are encouraging. Training in BGI was found to be related to significant improvement in pain management, general activity, mood, walking ability, routine work, relationships with others, sleep and enjoyment of life. Significant improvements were found for overall pain, as well as for mood and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: We see a trend of improvement following BGI, but more research is needed to investigate this technique. Significant improvements were found for overall pain, as well as for mood and quality of life. We recommend adding BGI to treatment plans for patients suffering chronic, fibromyalgia-related pain. While other guided imagery methods last up to 20 minutes per session, BGI is innovative since only two minutes are required to obtain a positive effect on chronic pain and quality of life measures.",

      "abstract": "Slow-wave sleep is one of the most important restorative components of sleep and central for our health and cognitive functioning. Although the amount of slow-wave sleep depends on sleep drive, age and other factors, also the pre-sleep mental state might influence sleep depth. We had shown that a pre-sleep hypnotic suggestion to sleep more deeply increased slow-wave sleep duration in hypnotizable subjects. In contrast, low-hypnotizable participants decreased sleep depth after this intervention. A possible reason might be an aversion to and active resistance against hypnosis. To overcome this potential opposition, we introduced the procedure as 'guided imagery'. We replaced the hypnotic induction by a breathing relaxation. Importantly, the suggestion 'to sleep more deeply' remained identical. We expected that these changes would make it easier for low-hypnotizable subjects to benefit from the suggestion. In contrast, young healthy low-hypnotizable participants did not show positive effects. Similar to our previous studies, they exhibited a reduced slow-wave sleep duration after the intervention. Additionally, the ratio between slow-wave activity and beta band power decreased. Subjective sleep quality remained unaffected. Our results indicate that suggestions to sleep more deeply result in decreased sleep depth in low-hypnotizable participants regardless of the mental technique (guided imagery versus hypnosis). Thus, the aversion against hypnosis per se cannot explain the detrimental effect of the intervention on slow-wave sleep in low-hypnotizable subjects. The results support the notion that our mental state before sleep can influence subsequent slow-wave sleep. However, the mechanisms of the contradictory decrease in low-hypnotizable subjects remain unknown.",

      "abstract": "The currently best-supported psychological treatment for nightmares is imagery rehearsal therapy. The problem, however, is that not enough trained practitioners are available to offer this treatment. A possible solution is to conduct imagery rehearsal therapy in a guided self-help format. In the current study, 70 participants with nightmares according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders were randomized to either telephone-guided imagery rehearsal therapy (n = 36) or a wait-list condition (n = 34). Participants in the imagery rehearsal therapy condition received three sessions over the course of 5 weeks. Every treatment session was followed by telephone support delivered by postgraduate students. Participants who received imagery rehearsal therapy showed larger improvements on nightmare frequency (d = 1.03; p < .05), nightmare distress (d = 0.75; p < .05) and insomnia severity (d = 1.12; p < .001) compared with the participants in the wait-list condition. The effects were sustained at 3- and 6-month follow-up. No significant effects were observed on the number of nights with nightmares per week, anxiety and depression. In line with earlier reports, the treatment effect was mediated by the increase of mastery at mid-treatment, underlining the mechanistic value of mastery in imagery rehearsal therapy. The present study demonstrates that it is possible to deliver imagery rehearsal therapy in a self-help format supported by unexperienced therapists and with relatively little time investment. This opens possibilities in terms of cost-effectiveness, scalability and dissemination of imagery rehearsal therapy in the treatment of nightmares.",

Telephone-based tobacco quitlines are a standard of care, but reach is limited. Adding guided imagery to quitline services might increase reach by offering an alternative approach. PURPOSE: To develop and test the feasibility and potential impact of a guided imagery-based tobacco cessation intervention delivered using a quitline model. METHODS: Participants for this randomized feasibility trial were recruited statewide through a quitline or community-based methods. Participants were randomized to guided imagery Intervention Condition (IC) or active behavioral Control Condition (CC). After withdrawals, there were 105 participants (IC = 56; CC = 49). The IC consisted of six sessions in which participants created guided imagery audio files. The CC used a standard six-session behavioral protocol. Feasibility measures included recruitment rate, retention, and adherence to treatment. We also assessed 6-month quit rates and consumer satisfaction. RESULTS: Both the IC and CC protocols were feasible to deliver. We finalized protocols and materials for participants, coaches and study staff, and delivered the protocols with fidelity. We developed successful recruitment methods, and experienced high retention (6 months = 81.9%) and adherence (all sessions = 66.7%). Long-term quit rates (IC = 27.9%; CC = 38.1%) compared favorably to those of quitlines, and program satisfaction was high, suggesting that the protocols are acceptable to smokers and may contribute to smoking abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: The guided imagery intervention is feasible and promising, suggesting that a fully powered RCT to test the efficacy of the intervention is warranted.

METHODS: It was a randomized non-blinded controlled trial, including pre - and post assessments, comparing a 3-week relaxation intervention with the standard psychological care. Participants were recruited consecutively from two Public Pediatric Oncology - Hematology Departments in Cyprus and Greece. Fifty four parents of children hospitalized with a malignancy, were randomly assigned either to the intervention group (n = 29), receiving the Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) and Guided Imagery (GI) Relaxation Techniques or to the control group (n = 25) receiving only the Standard Psychological Care by nurses and psychologists. Data were collected with the Questionnaire of 'Ways of Coping Checklist' (WofCC). RESULTS: The results showed that the intervention did not have an impact on the coping strategies that parents employed as these are reflected on the WofCC' factors. The results showed that parents in both intervention and control group prefer using positive ways of coping in stressful situations: positive approach, positive re-evaluation and prayer/daydreaming. CONCLUSIONS: The findings did not support the utilization of PMR and GI as coping strategies altering interventions in this clinical context. However, these findings should be interpreted in light of the short duration of the intervention that under these specific circumstances might have required a more lengthy approach for coping strategies to be altered. Furthermore, the stress relieving properties of these interventions could fortify (although not altering) existing coping strategies."

RESULTS: A total of 1101 records were identified, of which 21 were included in the qualitative synthesis. Two random model meta-analysis were performed with eight trials. Guided imagery preoperatively was shown to be effective in relieving preoperative state anxiety in children (d = -3.71), preoperative trait anxiety in adults (d = -0.64) and postoperative pain in adults (d = -0.24). Postoperative pain in children and preoperative state anxiety in adults was reduced but without significant difference.

Materials and methods: This is a quasi-experimental study, with pretest and posttest design, which was carried out on 100 pregnant women with complaints of nausea and vomiting who had referred to general health centers to receive pregnancy care. In accordance with the specified content, women in the intervention group received 3 sessions of psycho-education based on relaxation methods for a week. Four weeks after the end of education and before the 16th week of pregnancy, data were gathered from both the intervention and control groups using the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Vomiting and Nausea (PUQEN) scale. Data were analyzed with the aid of statistical tests. Results: There was no significant difference between the average values of HG in the intervention group and the control group prior to the intervention. However, after receiving psycho-education, the average value of nausea and vomiting in pregnant women of the intervention group (5.11 ± 1.60) was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.00 ± 1.66) (p = 0.035). Conclusion: The psycho-education based on relaxation methods of this study had a positive and significant effect on reducing the intensity of HG. It is helpful to integrate the educational content of this intervention in the caring programs of pregnant women with nausea and vomiting."

To optimize humanistic care, integration of evidence-based complementary and alternative therapies holds promise. However, evidence of critical care nurses' use of complementary and alternative therapies in clinical practice has not been evaluated recently. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine critical care nurses' perspectives of music therapy, aromatherapy, and guided imagery (GI) including perceptions of legitimacy, self-reported knowledge, interest in gaining knowledge, beliefs of harm/benefits, professional use, personal use, recommendations for use in critical care practice, and requests for these therapies by critical care patients or families. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional design with repeated measures was conducted with critical care nurses (N = 53) practicing in 3 intensive care units at a Midwestern academic-affiliated medical center. The nurses' current perceptions, knowledge, beliefs, and use of music therapy, aromatherapy, and GI were assessed. In addition, an evaluation of the consistency of participants' responses using the Critical Care Nurses' Use of Complementary Therapies survey was performed on a subset of the sample (n = 15) at 2 time points 4 to 6 weeks apart. RESULTS: Most nurses (66%-83%) endorsed the legitimacy of these therapies for use with their patients. Nurses had the most knowledge of aromatherapy, followed by music therapy and GI; they showed interest in gaining further knowledge of the therapies even when reporting \"some\" to \"a lot\" of knowledge. Nurses showed a positive response regarding their beliefs about the benefits of each therapy. Professional use was highest for aromatherapy (85%), followed by music therapy (75%), corresponding with greater self-reported knowledge and personal use. A majority recommended aromatherapy (79%) and music therapy in practice (64%) and reported that these therapies were requested by patients or families. Responses on the survey items at 2 time points of administration showed consistency. DISCUSSION: On the basis of the overall survey responses, developing a robust scientific base and addressing educational needs through expanding resources and continuing education programs may promote use of these therapies to benefit patients in critical care.",

The Heideggerian understanding was used for analyzing the data, which occurred in two stages: vague and medium understanding, and hermeneutics. RESULTS: Nine women between the ages of 45 and 67 participated in the study. The data allowed us to understand the meaning of guided imagery relaxation from the participants, since they could be classified into three units of meaning: cancer stigma, facing disease and treatment benefits. CONCLUSION: The meaning of guided imagery relaxation made it possible to understand the being-in-the-world during the provided reflections, and it is possible to verify the importance of the nurse's offer of therapy in caring for women with breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Guided imagery (GI) is an evidence-based method that uses the imagination to practice and achieve a desired outcome. Little research has focused on how GI can be delivered to smokers using remote or virtual methods, such as a telephone-based intervention. Telephone-based services for tobacco cessation (quitlines) have emerged as standard of care for tobacco cessation. However, quitlines reach only a small fraction of smokers, and men and racial/ethnic minorities are less likely to use quitlines than majority women. GI has the potential to attract under-served minority groups as well as smokers who are looking for an alternative approach to cessation. The present study is designed to test the feasibility and potential impact of a GI tobacco cessation intervention delivered by telephone. This study compares the GI intervention with a standard behavioral (SB) intervention. METHODS: Participants (N = 100) are randomized to either the GI (intervention) or SB (control) condition. Each condition features a 6-week intervention in which participants work with coaches to quit tobacco. Primary outcomes are feasibility related (recruitment, retention, adherence), and secondary outcomes include cessation at 6 months post-intervention (7-day and 30-day abstinence). DISCUSSION: A GI intervention delivered via quitline would allow for scalability and dissemination, potentially reaching a more representative group of smokers. Results from this study will determine the feasibility of delivering the GI intervention, and describe the reach of the intervention to under-represented tobacco users. If successful, our study results will guide the design and conduct of a future efficacy trial."

      "abstract": "To analyze how emotions and imagery are shared, processed and recognized in Guided Imagery and Music, we measured the brain activity of an experienced therapist (\"Guide\") and client (\"Traveler\") with dual-EEG in a real therapy session about potential death of family members. Synchronously with the EEG, the session was video-taped and then micro-analyzed. Four raters identified therapeutically important moments of interest (MOI) and no-interest (MONI) which were transcribed and annotated. Several indices of emotion- and imagery-related processing were analyzed: frontal and parietal alpha asymmetry, frontal midline theta, and occipital alpha activity. Session ratings showed overlaps across all raters, confirming the importance of these MOIs, which showed different cortical activity in visual areas compared to resting-state. MOI 1 was a pivotal moment including an important imagery with a message of hope from a close family member, while in the second MOI the Traveler sent a message to an unborn baby. Generally, results seemed to indicate that the emotions of Traveler and Guide during important moments were not positive, pleasurably or relaxed when compared to resting-state, confirming both were dealing with negative emotions and anxiety that had to be contained in the interpersonal process. However, the temporal dynamics of emotion-related markers suggested shifts in emotional valence and intensity during these important, personally meaningful moments; for example, during receiving the message of hope, an increase of frontal alpha asymmetry was observed, reflecting increased positive emotional processing. EEG source localization during the message suggested a peak activation in left middle temporal gyrus. Interestingly, peaks in emotional markers in the Guide partly paralleled the Traveler's peaks; for example, during the Guide's strong feeling of mutuality in MOI 2, the time series of frontal alpha asymmetries showed a significant cross-correlation, indicating similar emotional processing in Traveler and Guide. Investigating the moment-to-moment interaction in music therapy showed how asymmetry peaks align with the situated cognition of Traveler and Guide along the emotional contour of the music, representing the highs and lows during the therapy process. Combining dual-EEG with detailed audiovisual and qualitative data seems to be a promising approach for further research into music therapy."

DESIGN: This is a prospective randomized controlled study. METHODS: In addition to standard treatment and nursing care, guided imagery was applied to the intervention group once in the preoperative period, once on the first day of postoperative period, twice in the second and third days, for six times in total. Only standard treatment and nursing care were given to the patients of the control group. FINDINGS: Anxiety and intensity of pain were significantly higher in the control group than the intervention group, and the level of satisfaction and sleep quality were lower in the control group than the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Results support that guided imagery can be useful in improving perianesthetic symptoms and can be a part of nursing care.",

Due to the unstable setting in refugee state registration and reception centers, recommended trauma-focused treatment approaches are often not applicable. For this purpose, we devised a suitable therapeutic approach to treat traumatized refugees in a German state registration and reception center: Group therapy, focusing on stabilizing techniques and guided imagery according to Reddemann (2017). From May 2017 to April 2018, we conducted semi-structured interviews with n = 30 traumatized refugees to assess their experiences with the stabilizing techniques and guided imagery in group sessions and self-practice. Participants mainly reported that they had more pleasant feelings, felt increasingly relaxed, and could better handle recurrent thoughts. Additionally, the participants noticed that their psychosocial functioning had improved. The main difficulties that participants encountered were feeling stressed, having difficulties staying focused, or concentrating on the techniques. During self-practice, the participants found it most challenging that they did not have any verbal guidance, were often distracted by the surroundings in the accommodation, and had recurrent thoughts about post-migratory stressors, such as insecurity concerning the future or the application for asylum. Our results show that stabilizing techniques and guided imagery according to Reddemann (2017) are a suitable approach to treat traumatized refugees living in volatile conditions."

The objective of this article is to describe the feasibility, acceptability, and quantitative stress-related outcomes of a 6-week pilot lifestyle intervention using guided imagery (GI) council in order to reduce risk factors for obesity-related disease. METHODS: Seventeen urban, adolescents (12 females/5 males, 16 Latino, age 17 ± 1 years, grades 9-12, body mass index 22 ± 4) participated in the 6-week, after-school pilot intervention. The intervention consisted of three, 75-minute after-school sessions delivered weekly for 6 weeks. The 3 weekly sessions included 1 session each of nutrition education, physical activity education and practice, and GI delivered in council, a facilitated group process based on indigenous practices. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed by attendance and qualitative exit interview. Stress outcomes included salivary cortisol and perceived stress. RESULTS: The pilot intervention was found to be feasible to deliver in an after-school setting. The GI and council group format were well liked. A 31% reduction in salivary cortisol was observed following the stress-reduction GI sessions. Diurnal cortisol patterns did not change across the intervention, but change in perceived stress was correlated with change in cortisol awakening response. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was feasible to deliver and highly acceptable. Acute reduction in salivary cortisol was seen following group GI, while no change was seen in daily cortisol patterns. These results support the development of a full 12-week intervention using GI council to reduce obesity-related disease risk."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension (high blood pressure) in pregnancy carries a high risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. Although antihypertensive drugs are commonly used, they have adverse effects on mothers and fetuses. Guided imagery is a non-pharmacological technique that has the potential to lower blood pressure among pregnant women with hypertension. Guided imagery is a mind-body therapy that involves the visualisation of various mental images to facilitate relaxation and reduction in blood pressure. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of guided imagery as a non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension in pregnancy and its influence on perinatal outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, and two trials registers (October 2018). We also searched relevant conference proceedings and journals, and scanned the reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We would have included RCTs using a cluster-randomised design, but none were identified. We excluded quasi-RCTs and cross-over trials.We sought intervention studies of various guided imagery techniques performed during pregnancy in comparison with no intervention or other non-pharmacological treatments for hypertension (e.g. quiet rest, music therapy, aromatherapy, relaxation therapy, acupuncture, acupressure, massage, device-guided slow breathing, hypnosis, physical exercise, and yoga). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for the included studies. We checked extracted data for accuracy, and resolved differences in assessments by discussion. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included two small trials (involving a total of 99 pregnant women) that compared guided imagery with quiet rest. The trials were conducted in Canada and the USA. We assessed both trials as at high risk of performance bias, and low risk of attrition bias; one trial was at low risk for selection, detection, and reporting bias, while the other was at unclear risk for the same domains.We could not perform a meta-analysis because the two included studies reported different outcomes, and the frequency of the intervention was slightly different between the two studies. One study performed guided imagery for 15 minutes at least twice daily for four weeks, or until the baby was born (whichever came first). In the other study, the intervention included guided imagery, self-monitoring of blood pressure, and thermal biofeedback-assisted relaxation training for four total hours; the participants were instructed to practice the procedures twice daily and complete at least three relief relaxation breaks each day. The control groups were similar - one was quiet rest, and the other was quiet rest as bed rest.None of our primary outcomes were reported in the included trials: severe hypertension (either systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or higher, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg or higher); severe pre-eclampsia, or perinatal death (stillbirths plus deaths in the first week of life). Only one of the secondary outcomes was measured.Low-certainty evidence from one trial (69 women) suggests that guided imagery may make little or no difference in the use of antihypertensive drugs (risk ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 2.22). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to inform practice about the use of guided imagery for hypertension in pregnancy.The available evidence for this review topic is sparse, and the effect of guided imagery for treating hypertension during pregnancy (compared with quiet rest) remains unclear. There was low-certainty evidence that guided imagery made little or no difference to the use of antihypertensive drugs, downgraded because of imprecision.The two included trials did not report on any of the primary outcomes of this review. We did not identify any trials comparing guided imagery with no intervention, or with another non-pharmacological method for hypertension.Large and well-designed RCTs are needed to identify the effects of guided imagery on hypertension during pregnancy and on other relevant outcomes associated with short-term and long-term maternal and neonatal health. Trials could also consider utilisation and costs of health service.",

      "abstract": "Several studies have shown the efficacy of psychological interventions in reducing preoperative anxiety in children undergoing surgery. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a specific non-pharmacological technique, the relaxation-guided imagery, in reducing both preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain in a sample of 60 children (6-12 years old) undergoing minor surgery who were randomly assigned to the experimental group (N = 30) or the control group (N = 30). The first group received the relaxation-guided imagery, before the induction of general anesthesia; the second group received standard care. The levels of preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain were assessed using, respectively, the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability Scale. The results showed a statistically significant difference between groups, with less anxiety and less pain for children included in the experimental group (p < .001; p < .001).Conclusion: Results suggest that relaxation-guided imagery reduces preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain in children. Future studies should focus on developing protocols and studying the eventual reduction of administered drugs for anesthesia and pain. What is Known: • Literature suggests the usefulness of relaxation-guided imagery in reducing anxiety and pain in the perioperative period. • Stronger evidences are needed to support the application of relaxation-guided imagery as routine care in pediatric surgery. What is New: • To our knowledge, this is the first randomized study to investigate the efficacy of relaxation-guided imagery in reducing preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain within a single pediatric sample. • The present study provides stronger evidence in an area that is lacking in research.",

This multicentre randomised controlled trial was designed to assess the adjuvant effect of PMR-IGI in alleviating pain in a sample of hospice patients with terminal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 104 patients were randomised to two groups. Group A patients (n = 53) were administered the Revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS-r) and the numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain immediately prior to (T1) and 2 h following an individual PMR-IGI session (T3). Group B patients (n = 51) received usual care and were assessed using the same tools. Acute pain episodes and rescue analgesics over the following 24 h were recorded. RESULTS: The Pain Intensity Difference (NRS at T3-NRS at T1) was 1.83 in group A and 0.55 in group B and was significant in both groups (p < 0.0001). The mean Total Symptom Distress Score declined by 8.83 in group A and by 1.84 in group B.The average difference in the emotional symptoms ESAS-r subscore (anxiety and depression) was 2.93 in group A (p < 0.0001) and 0.07 in group B (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this trial suggest that PMR-IGI may be considered as an effective adjuvant in alleviating pain-related distress in terminal cancer patients. Further studies should be performed to assess the effectiveness of repeated interventions.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a significant mental health issue in modern society and empirical research into effective interventions to address anxiety has been extensive. Spending time in nature is one approach that has demonstrated anxiolytic effects. However, in some situations and contexts spending time in nature in order to reduce anxiety symptoms may not be possible. For example, in therapeutic settings delivered in a space with no access or exposure to any nature stimuli in the immediate surrounding environment. Guided imagery (GI) has also proven to be effective for reducing anxiety symptoms. Thus, nature-based GI might help to overcome the limitation of access to nature and strengthen the impact of GI interventions. The current study investigated the effectiveness of nature-based GI on anxiety reduction. Participants (n = 48, 18 males, 30 females, M age = 34.54, SD age = 12.91, age range = 19 - 71 years) with moderate levels of either trait or state anxiety as measured by the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) were recruited. Participants undertook both a nature-based GI session and a traditional non-nature-based GI session and their pre- and post- state anxiety levels were measured in each GI session. It was anticipated that post state anxiety scores would be significantly lower for both GI conditions and that a significantly greater anxiety reduction would be found in the nature-based GI than the urban-based GI. A two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed results that supported both hypotheses. This study was the first to compare a nature based GI intervention with a traditional (non-nature based) GI intervention. Findings indicate that nature-based GI interventions are effective anxiety management interventions that have the added benefit of being cost-effective and easily accessible."

The current study aimed to compare the effects of EMDR and guided imagery on pain severity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 75 patients were selected using non-random method, and then allocated into two intervention groups and one control group. Interventions were conducted individually in six consecutive sessions for the intervention groups. The Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain Scale was used for data collection before and after the interventions. Collected data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics in SPSS. Significance level was considered at P<0.05. RESULTS: The post-intervention mean scores of physiological, affective, sensory-discriminative, and cognitive pain sub-scales for patients in guided imagery group were 16.3±2.2, 13.9±2.2, 30.6±3.4, and 23.2±3, respectively. The post-intervention mean scores of these sub-scales in the EMDR group were 22±1.5, 18.1±1.8, 39.6±2.8, and 29±1.8, respectively. A significant difference was observed in the mean pain score between EMDR and guided imagery groups, and also between each intervention group and the control group (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Guided imagery and EMDR could reduce pain in rheumatoid arthritis, but pain reduction was more following the EMDR than guided imagery."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects ofguided imagery on state and trait anxiety and sleep quality among hemodial ysis patients. DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled trial. A total of seventy hemodialysis patients were assigned through block randomization to either an intervention group to receive guided imagery or a control group to receive routine care services. SETTING: The study was performed in the hemodialysis unit of Akhavan teaching hospital, Kashan, Iran. INTERVENTION: In addition to routine care services, patients in the intervention group received guided imagery six times a week for four successive weeks via listening to a guided imagery instructional compact disk and following the instructions. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Before and four weeks after the intervention, state and trait anxiety and sleep quality were measured via Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: The results of analysis of covariance showed that the intervention and the control groups significantly differed from each other respecting the posttest mean scores of state anxiety (adjusted mean difference: -9.11; 95% CI = -10.26 to_-7.96; P < 0.001), trait anxiety (adjusted mean difference: -8.94; 95% CI = -10.31_to -7.57; P < 0.001), and sleep quality (adjusted mean difference: -0.877; 95% CI = -1.51_to -0.24; P < 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Guided imagery can significantly alleviate anxiety and improve sleep quality among hemodialysis patients. Nurses are recommended to use guided imagery to alleviate hemodialysis patients' anxiety and improve their sleep quality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain following orthopedic surgery can be intense due to the nature of the surgical procedure. Pain is a multilevel phenomenon that includes physiological and psychosocial components. Interventions that address body, mind, and spirit are needed to provide holistic management of pain. Guided imagery is a mind-body intervention that can address all aspects of the patient's pain experience. PURPOSE: This integrative review, informed by Watson's theory of human caring, identifies evidence that either supports or refutes the use of guided imagery as a supplement to pharmaceutical pain management for postoperative orthopedic patients. METHOD: An integrative literature search was conducted. Twenty-two studies were identified as potentially relevant to this study. Nine of the articles met all inclusion criteria and were included in this study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on the evidence reviewed, it is recommended that guided imagery be used as an adjunct for pain management in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. However, additional research in this area is needed. Future research: Two topics for further research were identified. The first is a need to identify an optimal frequency of use of guided imagery. The second is to identify how to ensure patients are using the intervention as recommended.",

This report describes the protocol of the Imagine HEALTH cluster randomized control trial, that tests an intervention based in Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and uses lifestyle education combined with the mind-body, complementary health modality of guided imagery (GI), to address obesity prevention and treatment in predominantly Latino adolescents. The primary aim is to determine the unique effects of each of the three major components of the 12-week lifestyle intervention (lifestyle education, stress reduction guided imagery, and lifestyle behavior guided imagery) compared to control on primary outcomes of physical activity (accelerometry), dietary intake (3-day recall), and stress biomarker levels (salivary cortisol). Secondary aims assess changes compared to controls in psychosocial outcomes (stress, well-being, depression), diabetes-related metabolic outcomes (adiposity, insulin resistance), maintenance of outcome changes for one year post-intervention, and SDT-based mediation of intervention effects. The development and rationale for each of the intervention components, study design, and outcome measurement processes are described. Adolescent participants recruited from four urban schools are cluster randomized by school into one of four arms of the 12-week (3-month) intervention, followed by 6 months of maintenance and 6 months of no contact. Outcome measures are assessed at the end of each period (3-, 9-, and 15-months). Results to date show successful recruitment of 97% of the target study population. Future results will demonstrate the effects of this integrative intervention on primary and secondary outcome measures in adolescents at risk for lifestyle-related metabolic disease.",

However, there have been no studies on the effect of GI on the comfort of inpatients of palliative care (PC) units. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of GI on the comfort of patients in PC. A 1-group, pretest-posttest, pre-experimental design was used to measure differences in heart rate, respiratory rate, pain, and comfort in patients (n = 26) before and after a 2-session GI program. The intervention featuring GI increased comfort, measured by an Abbreviated Holistic Comfort Scale and the visual analog comfort scale (P < .001), and decreased heart rate (P < .001), respiratory rate (P < .001), and pain, as measured by the (numerical) visual analog pain scale (P < .001). This study demonstrates that the use of an intervention featuring GI increases the comfort of oncology patients admitted to a PC unit. The use of GI by nurses is inexpensive, straightforward to implement, and readily available and may result in the provision of comfort care.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional abdominal pain disorders are chronic abdominal pain conditions, which affect up to 20% of children worldwide. Of the various functional abdominal pain disorder treatment modalities, psychological therapies such as guided imagery therapy appear most effective. However, there are significant barriers to receiving psychological therapies, including access to trained therapists. Alternatively, remotely delivered psychological therapies for functional abdominal pain disorders have been efficacious. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess acceptability of a proposed guided imagery therapy app designed to treat functional abdominal pain disorders through remote delivery of prerecorded audio sessions and to evaluate user preferences for using such an app. METHODS: Using a mixed-methods approach, we conducted a predevelopment formative study among children aged 7 to 12 years with a functional abdominal pain disorder and their parents. The parents completed our modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire, which quantified behavioral intention and related factors for using a guided imagery therapy app. Dyads participated in separate in-person semistructured interviews to assess their attitudes toward and preferences for a guided imagery therapy app. Questionnaire and interview findings were collected concurrently, analyzed separately, and then integrated through methods triangulation. RESULTS: Among the 15 participating parent-child dyads, 5 (33%) children were Hispanic and 11 (73%) had irritable bowel syndrome. They had diverse socioeconomic status. All parent participants were mothers. The TAM questionnaire indicated that mothers scored favorably on behavioral intention to use a guided imagery therapy app (mean score 12.0, SD 2.6, possible range 3-15). Scores for the TAM factors perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, hedonic motivation, compatibility, and habit also were favorable. Maternal interviews confirmed positive attitudes toward the proposed app. They advocated a visual component to hold their child's attention during the guided imagery therapy sessions; recommended incorporating background sounds into the sessions; favored session reminder notifications from the app; and thought the best time for their child to listen to the sessions would be in the evening or before bed. The child interviews also confirmed positive attitudes toward the proposed app. They suggested guided imagery therapy session topics such as sports and adventures; listening to sessions in their bedroom; and the need for parental supervision to install the app on their mobile device. Integration of the quantitative and qualitative methods findings complimented one another on acceptability. The favorable behavioral intention TAM score aligned well with expressed positive maternal and child attitudes toward the app and can be explained by the desire to avoid medications. The questionnaire and interviews also confirmed therapeutic benefit as an intrinsic motivator to promote routine use. CONCLUSIONS: A guided imagery therapy app designed to treat pediatric patients with functional abdominal pain disorders appears to be acceptable to both mothers and children. Incorporating parent and child preferences into a guided imagery therapy app could promote therapeutic compliance and increase access to optimal care."

These techniques targeted the intrusion and elaboration stages of the craving process, respectively (Kavanagh, Andrade, & May, 2005). Participants underwent a seven-day baseline period followed by a seven-day intervention period, during which they recorded their food cravings as they occurred using online diaries accessed via smartphone. In the intervention period, participants were randomly assigned to one of cognitive defusion, guided imagery or control conditions. Participants in the cognitive defusion and guided imagery conditions listened to three-minute audio clips containing their respective instructions every time they experienced a food craving, and rated their craving intensity before and after the intervention, while the control participants recorded their cravings as they did in the baseline week. Results showed that both cognitive defusion and guided imagery techniques reduced craving frequency, intensity, the likelihood of consumption following cravings, and craving-related calorie intake, consistent with predictions. These findings show that cognitive defusion and guided imagery are useful for dealing with naturally occurring cravings across a range of foods, and can reduce craving-related consumption in everyday life.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on pregnant women in the city of Kashan at 28-36 weeks. At the onset of the study, demographic questionnaire, Edinburgh Depression Scale, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were completed. Providing obtaining score of mild-to-moderate in the stress, anxiety, and depression scale and score of 10 or higher in Edinburgh Depression Scale, individuals were divided randomized to the intervention group (n = 33) and control group (n = 33). DASS-21 was again completed in the 4th-7th weeks of beginning of the study by all women. RESULTS: Analysis of variance with repeated measures indicated significant differences in mean of scores of stress, anxiety, and depression at three different times in relaxation group (P < 0.05) whereas found no significant differences in the mean of scores of stress, anxiety, and depression in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, relaxation could reduce stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women during six sessions. Due to the simplicity and low cost of this technique, it can be used to reduce stress and anxiety in pregnant women and improve pregnancy outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous systematic reviews indicate that progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and guided imagery (GI) are both effective interventions to decrease the psychological impact and to alleviate the adverse events in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment. To date, no review studies have investigated the effectiveness of a combination of PMR and GI. AIM: To systematically review the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of the PMR-GI combination on cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: A search for relevant records was carried out in four electronic databases (AMED, Cochrane Library, Pubmed and Scopus). After removing the duplicates 342 publications were screened and 71 were considered as potentially relevant. The flow of information of this study was in line with the PRISMA statement. Original articles investigating the application of both PMR and GI through a randomized trial on patients receiving chemotherapy were included. Those using PMR or GI alone and those combining other techniques together with PMR and GI were excluded. The trials' quality was assessed using the Jadad Scale. RESULTS: Eight papers reporting the results of seven independent trials were finally included. All of them included only breast cancer patients, apart from a single trial using a mixed sample of breast and prostate cancer patients. Seven of the included trials reported beneficial effects on mental state (mood, anxiety, and depression) and on toxicity (nausea and vomiting). Three trials reported an effect on biomarkers (heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol, and immunity). Four trials scored three of five points on the Jadad Scale, two trials scored two points and a single trial scored zero. CONCLUSIONS: Independent trials indicate that the PMR-GI combination is an effective way to tackle the impact of nausea and vomiting and to improve patients' mental state. However, studies involving other types of primary tumors would be useful because seven of the eight clinical trials only included breast cancer patients. Future research on the identification of potential effects on disease-related parameters (e.g., cytokines and disease-recurrence) and on patient survival is highly needed.",

This integrative health technique is used for healing, health maintenance, or the treatment of specific conditions. Guided imagery is an integral part of mindfulness meditation, hypnosis, and various relaxation exercises. However, evidence to support the widespread use and dissemination of guided imagery interventions has been lacking. The purposes of this scoping review were to document the scope of health outcomes and disease processes examined by guided imagery researchers and the journal outlets where this work has been published. Secondary purposes were to review the efficacy of guided imagery, risk of bias from studies published in selected integrative health journals, and gain feedback from clinicians in a practiced-based research network (PBRN) about potential barriers for use in clinical settings. METHODS: Ten bibliographic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1960 and 2013 that included adult participants. Descriptive and analytic methods were employed to document the journal outlets, diseases, and health outcomes investigated. RESULTS: 320 RCTs that included more than 17,979 adult participants were reviewed. The published studies appeared in 216 peer-reviewed journals from diverse disciplines largely representing psychology, the sport sciences, rehabilitation, nursing, and medicine. Major outcomes observed were coping with pain, stroke recovery, anxiety, coping with stress, and sport skills. Practitioner feedback from the PBRN revealed some interest but skepticism and time constraints were discussed as barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing research and creative dissemination techniques are warranted."

This exploratory efficacy study examined the effects of Healing Light Guided Imagery (HLGI), a novel variant of guided imagery, compared with a wait-list control in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Changes in the Beck Depression Inventory, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life instrument (physical and mental components) were compared between groups. Patients who completed HLGI (N = 9) showed significant reductions in depressed mood ( P < .05) and fatigue ( P < .01) and showed significant gains in physical ( P = .01) and mental ( P < .01) quality of life compared with journaling (N = 8). Our results suggest that HLGI can improve self-reported physical and mental well-being in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

DATA SOURCE: PubMed, Lilacs, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Cinahl, between August 2006 and December 2016. Descriptors: Postoperative Pain, Imagery (Psychotherapy) and Guided Imagery. STUDY SELECTION: original studies published in English, Spanish and Portuguese. 291 studies were identified and eight were selected. Descriptive data analysis, presented in detail, with a summary of the knowledge produced in each study. RESULTS: In the primary studies included, the use of guided imagery associated with other complementary therapies was highlighted: hand and foot \"M\" technique, education on postoperative pain management with analgesic drugs, relaxation exercises, respiration exercises, meditation, soothing biorhythmic music combined with positive and encouraging assertions and music with nature sounds. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge synthesis resulting from this study indicates that evidence could be identified on the use of guided imagery associated with relaxation therapy as a complementary approach to drug analgesia in postoperative pain control strengthens its indication for nursing practice. This evidence, however, demonstrates that the quality of the use of this therapy is limited, and it is necessary to carry out new randomized clinical studies to fill the existing gaps in this topic.",

      "abstract": "This review is part II of a 2-part series that presents evidence on the effectiveness of aromatherapy and guided imagery for the symptom management of anxiety, pain, and insomnia in adult critically ill patients. Evidence from this review supports the use of aromatherapy for management of pain, insomnia, and anxiety in critically ill patients. Evidence also supports the use of guided imagery for managing these symptoms in critical care; however, the evidence is sparse, mixed, and weak. More studies with larger samples and stronger designs are needed to further establish efficacy of guided imagery for the management of anxiety, pain, and insomnia of critically ill patients; to accomplish this, standardized evidence-based intervention protocols to ensure comparability and to establish optimal effectiveness are needed. Discussion and recommendations related to the use of these therapies in practice and needs for future research in these areas were generated.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this randomized wait-list controlled trial was to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a guided imagery based multi-behavior intervention intended to address psychological stress, food cravings, and physical activity. Personalized guided imagery scripts were created and participants were instructed to practice guided imagery every day for 35 consecutive days. Of 48 women who enrolled, we report comparisons between 16 randomized to treatment with 19 who were wait-listed (overall Mage = 45.50; Mbodymassindex = 31.43). Study completers reported 89% compliance with practicing guided imagery during the intervention. A significant time-by-group interaction was observed with reductions in food cravings and increases in physical activity compared with wait-list controls. Telephone-based multi-behavior interventions that utilize guided imagery to address food cravings and exercise behavior appear to be acceptable for overweight and obese women. Future phone-based guided imagery research testing this skill to address multiple health behaviors is justified.",
