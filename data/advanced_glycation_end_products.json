      "abstract": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a group of compounds formed through non-enzymatic reactions between reducing sugars and proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids. AGEs can be generated in the body or introduced through dietary sources and smoking. Recent clinical and animal studies have highlighted the significant role of AGEs in various health conditions. These compounds accumulate in nearly all mammalian tissues and are associated with a range of diseases, including diabetes and its complications, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. This review summarizes the major diseases linked to AGE accumulation, presenting both clinical and experimental evidence. The pathologies induced by AGEs share common mechanisms across different organs, primarily involving oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and direct protein cross-linking. Interventions targeting AGE-related diseases focus on inhibiting AGE formation using synthetic or natural antioxidants, as well as reducing dietary AGE intake through lifestyle modifications. AGEs are recognized as significant risk factors that impact health and accelerate aging, particularly in individuals with hyperglycemia. Monitoring AGE level and implementing nutritional interventions can help maintain overall health and reduce the risk of AGE-related complications."

      "abstract": "AGEs are molecules formed by nonenzymatic glycation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, a process accelerated under hyperglycemic conditions such as DM1. These molecules interact with specific receptors, particularly the Receptor for AGEs (RAGE), triggering intracellular signaling cascades that promote oxidative stress through the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and activation of inflammatory pathways. A critical pathological mechanism involves the formation of neoantigens, modified self-proteins that elicit immune responses. Structural alterations caused by AGEs expose new epitopes or modify existing ones, making them targets for autoreactive T cells and autoantibodies. This mechanism is implicated in autoimmune skin diseases such as vitiligo and bullous pemphigoid. Oxidative stress plays a central role in these diseases, exacerbated by AGEs through the generation of ROS and depletion of antioxidants, leading to melanocyte destruction in vitiligo and tissue damage in bullous pemphigoid. In addition, hypoxia enhances ROS production, mitochondria, and other cellular systems contributing to oxidative stress. Emerging evidence suggests that hypoxia can be mitigated by oxygen nanobubbles. Targeting AGE formation and oxidative stress presents a promising approach for the management of autoimmune skin disorders in DM1. Therapeutic strategies targeting AGE formation, oxidative stress, and immune dysregulation show promise for managing autoimmune skin disorders in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). AGE inhibitors, such as aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine, reduce non-enzymatic protein glycation, limiting AGE accumulation and inflammatory signaling. Antioxidants, including polyphenols, vitamins C and E, N-acetylcysteine, selenium, and hydrogen-rich water, help neutralize Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), restoring oxidative balance. Combining AGE inhibitors and antioxidants may provide synergistic benefits by reducing oxidative stress and protein immunogenicity. Additionally, immune modulation therapies, such as Treg therapy and cytokine inhibitors, aim to restore immune tolerance and prevent autoimmune activation. Anti-TNF-α and IL-6 inhibitors offer targeted inflammation suppression, while RAGE antagonists mitigate AGE-induced immune dysregulation. This study aims to explore the role of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) in the pathogenesis of autoimmune skin disorders associated with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) and to evaluate potential therapeutic strategies targeting AGE formation and oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "Thermal treatments used in ultra-processed foods (UPFs) lead to advanced glycation end products (AGEs). UPFs and serum AGEs are associated with cardiometabolic disease. We explore differential cooking methods as a mechanistic link between UPFs and detrimental health outcomes through a randomized cross-over cooking method trial in healthy subjects using identical ingredients and a deep profiling analysis. We show that low-AGE-generating cooking methods such as boiling and steaming decrease serum AGEs, improve lipid profiles, and increase serum protein 4E-BP1. In contrast, high-AGE-generating cooking methods such as grilling and baking increase fecal butyrate. In sum, this suggests that low-AGE-generating cooking methods should be considered in cardiovascular risk prevention. Since current dietary guidelines focus on ingredients, but not cooking methods, our results suggest that culinary techniques should be considered as an important factor in cardiometabolic preventive strategies and future dietary trial design. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06547190)."

This study aims to evaluate the potential of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their endogenous secretory receptor (esRAGE) as non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing MASLD, to explore differences between obese and non-obese MASLD patients, and to develop a novel diagnostic model based on these biomarkers. METHODS: This study enrolled 341 participants, including 246 MASLD patients (118 non-obese, 128 obese) and 95 healthy controls. Serum AGEs and esRAGE levels were measured by ELISA. Key predictors were identified using the Lasso algorithm, and a diagnostic model was developed with logistic regression and visualized as nomograms. Diagnostic accuracy and utility were evaluated through the area under the curve (AUC), bootstrap validation, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Serum AGEs and esRAGE levels were significantly higher in MASLD patients compared to controls. Moreover, obese MASLD patients had higher esRAGE levels than non-obese ones, but no significant difference in AGEs levels was found. A diagnostic model incorporating age, WC, BMI, ALT, TG, HDL, AGEs, and esRAGE achieved an AUC of 0.963, with 94.3% sensitivity and 85.3% specificity. The AUC for bootstrap internal validation was 0.963 (95% CI: 0.944-0.982). Calibration curves showed strong predictive accuracy, and DCA demonstrated high net clinical benefit. CONCLUSION: Serum AGEs and esRAGE serve as non-invasive biomarkers for distinguishing MASLD patients. We developed and validated diagnostic models for MASLD, offering valuable tools to identify at-risk populations and improve prevention and treatment strategies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle mass and function, poses a major health risk to the elderly population. Although dietary advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) have been implicated in worsening sarcopenia, the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: A sarcopenia animal model was established by feeding a high AGE diet to C57BL/6 mice. Muscle function and mass were assessed using grip strength tests, and rotarod tests. Proteomic analysis was used to identify differentially expressed proteins. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and co-immunoprecipitation were employed to investigate protein interactions both in vivo and in vitro. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting were conducted to measure gene and protein expression levels. RESULTS: Our results revealed that dietary AGEs accelerated the onset of sarcopenia in mice by triggering apoptosis. Proteomic analysis showed a marked upregulation of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in the muscle tissues of mice fed a high AGE diet. PRMT1 mediated the arginine methylation of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 3 (CRTC3) at the R534 site within its transactivation domain, leading to CRTC3 activation. The activated CRTC3, together with Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a), transactivated the BAX (BCL2 associated X) gene, initiating Bax downstream signaling, promoting apoptosis in muscle cells, and contributing to muscle atrophy. Inhibition of PRMT1 prevented CRTC3 methylation and suppressed Bax-mediated apoptotic signaling in vitro. Moreover, in vivo treatment with PRMT1 and Bax inhibitors significantly attenuated AGE-induced sarcopenia in mice. CONCLUSION: PRMT1-mediated CRTC3 arginine methylation plays a critical role in AGE-induced sarcopenia and suggests potential therapeutic targets for preventing sarcopenia progression.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of Xiahuo Pingwei San (, XHPWS) on ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice and to explore the underlying mechanisms through a network pharmacology approach. METHODS: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was utilized to identify the chemical composition and authenticate the active constituents of XHPWS, ensuring rigorous quality control across batches. A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC model was established in C57BL/6 mice, which were treated with XHPWS in vivo. The efficacy against UC was assessed by measuring parameters such as body weight, disease activity index (DAI) scores, and colon length. Levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), in colonic tissue were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Histological analysis of colon sections was conducted using hematoxylin and eosin staining. A network pharmacology approach was employed to explore the mechanisms of XHPWS and to predict its potential targets in UC treatment. Predicted protein expressions in colonic tissue were validated using immune-ohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting techniques. RESULTS: XHPWS effectively alle viated DSS-induced UC symptoms in mice, as evidenced by restored body weight, reduced colon shortening, and decreased DAI scores. Histopathological examination revealed that XHPWS significantly reduced intestinal inflammatory infiltration, restored intestinal epithelial permeability, and increased goblet cell count. Network pharmacology analysis identified 63 active compounds in XHPWS and suggested that it might target 35 potential proteins associated with UC treatment. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the protective mechanism of XHPWS could be related to the advanced glycation end products-receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGE-RAGE) signaling pathway. Notably, quercetin, kaempferol, wogonin, and nobiletin, the main components of XHPWS, showed strong correlations with the core targets. Additionally, experimental validation demonstrated that XHPWS significantly decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in UC mice, while downregulating the expression of proteins related to the AGE-RAGE pathway. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that XHPWS effectively alle viates colitis symptoms and inflammation in UC mice, potentially through the regulation of the AGE-RAGE pathway. These findings provide strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of XHPWS in UC treatment, thereby broadening its clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Myocardial infarction (MI) and diabetes pose significant health challenges globally, necessitating the development of innovative medication strategies to improve outcomes in affected populations. This research aimed to determine the defensive impact of ferulic acid (FA) against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in diabetic rats. METHODS: A group of male rats was partitioned into five distinct groups: control group, diabetic group, diabetic + MI, diabetic + MI + 20 mg/kg FA, and diabetic + MI + 40 mg/kg FA. The experimental groups received isoproterenol (ISO) subcutaneously at a dosage of 50 mg/kg body weight for two consecutive days. RESULTS: The outcome was severe cardiac toxicity, as shown by changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm and a substantial increase in blood cardiac enzymes such as creatinine kinase (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Additionally, there was a surge in inflammatory cytokines, like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and a disruption of the antioxidant system, evidenced by a rise in malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Moreover, there was a rise in cardiac receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Treatment with FA with escalating dosages of 20 and 40 mg/kg b.w. effectively mitigated changes in serum cardiac enzymes and improved the cellular architecture, which was evaluated by histopathological examination. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in a dose-dependent manner, FA successfully showed a cardioprotective effect against ISO-induced cardiac toxicity in diabetic rats, as shown by the improvement in ECG findings, normalization of serum cardiac biomarkers, and augmentation of the endogenous antioxidant system. Therefore, the aforementioned data indicate that ferulic acid may potentially have a protective effect on MI patients who have diabetes mellitus."

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, is a rapidly growing global health concern with an anticipated prevalence of 700 million by 2045. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a major complication, is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults worldwide. Neurovascular units (NVUs), comprising neurons, glial cells, and vessels, maintain retinal homeostasis, and their impairment is considered a primary pathological change in early DR. While glycemic control is conventionally assessed by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), studies suggest additional factors influencing DR risk beyond equivalent HbA1c levels. Chronic hyperglycemia triggers neurovascular impairment through advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), inflammation, and oxidative stress. AGEs, accumulating irreversibly, play a crucial role in DR and other diabetic complications. Therapeutic interventions targeting AGEs, both endogenous and exogenous, are gaining traction, offering potential avenues to preserve NVU function. Existing drugs such as pioglitazone, angiotensin II receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and statins, along with natural compounds like benfotiamine and cinnamon bark extract, show promise as anti-AGE strategies. This multifaceted approach presents a paradigm shift in early diabetic retinopathy treatment, with ongoing research focusing on refining these strategies for improved management."

      "abstract": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) represent a class of toxic and irreversible compounds formed through non-enzymatic reactions between proteins or lipids and carbonyl compounds. AGEs can arise endogenously under normal metabolic conditions and in pathological states such as diabetes, kidney disease, and inflammatory disorders. Additionally, they can be obtained exogenously through dietary intake, particularly from foods high in fat or sugar, as well as grilled and processed items. AGEs accumulate in various organs and have been increasingly recognized as significant contributors to the progression of numerous diseases, particularly kidney disease. As the kidney plays a crucial role in AGE metabolism and excretion, it is highly susceptible to AGE-induced damage. In this review, we provide a comprehensive discussion on the role of AGEs in the onset and progression of various kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, and acute kidney injury. We explore the potential biological mechanisms involved, such as AGE accumulation, the AGEs-RAGE axis, oxidative stress, inflammation, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and AGE-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, we discuss recent findings on the metabolic characteristics of AGEs in vivo and their pathogenic impact on renal function. Additionally, we examine the clinical significance of AGEs in the early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of kidney diseases, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. By integrating recent advancements in AGE research, this review aims to provide new insights and strategies for mitigating AGE-related renal damage and improving kidney disease management.",

However, accurately determining individual AGEs in biological samples remains challenging due to the lack of standardized methods. In this study, we optimized and detailed procedures for AGE digestion using enzyme cocktails and separation and detection via high-resolution LC-MS/MS. For the first time, we observed that enzyme backgrounds contained higher levels of methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 (MG-H1) and glucosepane than mouse plasma by 1.4-3 times (e.g., 1512.55 ± 18.89 nM in enzymes vs 496.95 ± 90.91 nM in plasma for MG-H1). Using this optimized method, we quantified fructosyl-lysine and nine AGEs in the plasma, kidneys, and urine of mice. MGO-derived AGEs increased significantly in the plasma and kidneys after MGO treatment. Additionally, both MGO- and GO-derived AGEs were elevated in high-fat-diet (HF)-fed mice compared to low-fat-diet (LF)-fed controls, with further increases in HF-fed mice supplemented with MGO (HFM). This optimized method provides accurate AGE quantification, enabling insights into their role as biomarkers for metabolic syndrome and advancing the understanding of dietary and metabolic contributions to AGE formation.",

METHOD: This study selected community health service centers which had signed medical alliance agreement with the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and outpatints and inpatients in Anhui province. From March 2018 to July 2022, the multi-stage cluster sampling. method was used to screen residents aged 18-90 years in the above areas. Participants' blood was collected on an empty stomach to detect TSH, blood lipids, liver and kidney function and blood glucose, in addition, AGEs levels were detected by skin autofluorescence (SAF), and urine was retained to measure the ratio of urinary microalbumin to creatinine concentration by ACR. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the differences between general data, biochemical markers, and urinary ACR, association between variables. RESULT: A total of 7000 patients who participated in community health examination and inpatients and also had no history of serious mental disorders were selected. After excluding data with missing value of more than 5%, 6921 samples were finally included, and the effective rate was 94.4%. Following health risk factors (HRFs), such as body mass index (BMI), TSH, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), TyG (triglyceride glucose index), systolic blood pressure (SBP), cholesterol (TC), and uric acid (UA) were associated with a higher incidence of urine ACR. In moderation analysis, there is an significant effect among TSH, AGEs and DN, HRFs moderate also these effect. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that HRFs such as HDL, TyG and TC should be prioritized when evaluating indicators related to DN to effectively reduce DN in Chinese patients with high health risk levels. Comprehensive indicators may be an effective and practical. method to evaluate the metabolic progression of DN. Optimizing thyroid function management may be a new strategy to prevent and treat DN and may help reduce the risk of AGE-related complications in people with diabetes. This study highlights the important role of AGEs in the relationship between TSH and DN. In addition, future studies should further explore how to improve the management and prevention of DN by regulating TSH.Among the leading causes of disability and death in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD) occupies a certain position. Multi-factor intervention targeting advanced glycation end products (AGEs), blood glucose, blood pressure and lipids can reduce the morbidity and mortality of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in T2DM patients through thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which plays an important role in the pathological process of metabolic diseases such as DN. AGEs, as a key factor in metabolic regulation, may affect the formation and function of the thyroid gland; However, in DN, the correlation between AGEs and TSH has not been clarified. We hypothesized that AGEs aggravated the negative effect of TSH on DN. The.",

      "abstract": "Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) generated during protein glycation trigger significant concerns for human health. Exploring safe and effective natural ingredients exhibiting excellent AGEs inhibition has become a promising way to overcome this issue. This research focused on the structural features of Diaphragma Juglandis Fructus polysaccharide (FJP-1) as well as its AGE-inhibiting capacity and mechanisms. The results demonstrated that FJP-1 with a Mw of 22.54 kDa was composed of galactose (Gal), rhamnose (Rha), glucuronic acid (Glc-UA), galacturonic acid (Gal-UA), glucose (Glc) and arabinose (Ara) at a molar ratio of 9.58:3.52:2.72:74.95:1.52:7.71. Its backbone was probably composed of → 4)-Galp-UA-(1→, with branches of → 4,6)-Galp-(1 → and → 4)-Glcp-(1→. And the terminal branches were T-Rhap-(1→), T-Galp-(1→) and T-Araf. In three in vitro models of anti-glycosylation, FJP-1 effectively inhibited the formation of total and special fluorescent AGEs, reduced fructosamine levels, and prevented structural modifications, oxidation, and cross-linking of the protein. Mechanistic and multispectral assays elucidated that the anti-glycative mechanisms of FJP-1 were achieved by capturing methylglyoxal, scavenging free radicals, and binding to bovine serum albumin to form adducts. Pearson's correlation analyses showed that there were positive correlations between FJP-1's antioxidant property with the AGEs formation. This study demonstrated that FJP-1 is a potential AGEs inhibitor for development of functional foods and treatment various diseases mediated by AGEs and oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "Central obesity poses a significant health threat. Lutein-rich fruits and vegetables may help manage obesity. Limited evidence suggests that lutein exerts health effects by inhibiting advanced glycation end products (AGEs), but data on its effects in centrally obese individuals are sparse. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of lutein supplementation in subjects with central obesity. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted involving patients with central obesity. Anthropometric indices, dietary intake, metabolic parameters, carotenoid and AGEs levels were compared between those receiving a 32-week intervention of 10 mg d-1 lutein and a placebo group. There were 117 patients randomly assigned in the analysis. Twenty-three patients were lost to follow-up. Both intention-to-treat analysis and the per-protocol analysis showed significant reductions in plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and malonaldehyde levels in the lutein supplementation group compared with the placebo group. Significant differences were also observed between the groups in plasma lutein, carboxyethyl lysine (CEL), carboxymethyl lysine (CML), methylglyoxal hydroimidazolone (MG-HI) levels and skin carotenoid index (all P < 0.05). The mean difference and 95% confidence interval were 0.12 [0.08 to 0.16] μg ml-1, -8.76 [-16.60 to -0.89] ng ml-1, -72.3 [-134.0 to -10.9] ng ml-1, -233.9 [-429.0 to -36.8] ng ml-1 and 0.94 [0.56 to 1.31] a.u., respectively. Furthermore, changes in plasma lutein concentration were positively correlated with changes in the skin carotenoid index (r = 0.41, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated with changes in plasma CEL (r = -0.24, P = 0.018), (CML) (r = -0.21, P = 0.051, and MG-H1) (r = -0.25, P = 0.017). In conclusion, regular lutein intake can improve metabolic health in adults with central obesity by increasing plasma lutein concentrations, reducing oxidative stress, lowering plasma TC, LDL-C, and ApoB levels, and downregulating AGEs.",

They were randomly assigned to 12-weeks of an energy-restricted Standard-AGEs diet(S-AGEs) or an energy-restricted Low-AGEs diet(L-AGEs). At baseline and after 12-weeks of intervention, weight loss, oligo-amenorrhea, hormonal profiles, plasma lipid profiles, and inflammation markers were evaluated. During the intervention, 8 participants from the L-AGEs group and 6 from the S-AGEs group dropped out. Completers had similar baseline characteristics to dropouts. In the per-protocol analysis, similar weight loss was observed in the L-AGEs(n = 14) and S-AGEs(n = 16) groups compared to baseline weight [-8.4 [-10.3 to -5.8] vs. -5.2 [-8.8 to -4.6] kg, respectively, p = 0.183]. However, in the L-AGEs group, fasting glucose levels decreased significantly more compared to the S-AGEs group (-8.5 [-11.5 to -3.5] vs. -0.5 [-3.7 to 0.7] mmol/L, respectively, p = 0.027). Following the diet intervention in the L-AGEs group, the waist-to-hip circumference ratio, LDL-cholesterol, TNF-α, total testosterone (TT), free-androgen index (FAI), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels significantly decreased compared to baseline levels, while sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels increased.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) face complications due to the accumulation of protein-bound uremic toxins, such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular disease. Conventional HD techniques inadequately remove AGEs. This study evaluates the efficacy of the HA130 hemoadsorption cartridge combined with high-flux HD (HF-HD) in enhancing AGE removal. METHODS: This prospective, single-center study included 20 maintenance HD patients randomized into two groups: HF-HD alone (n = 10) and HF-HD plus hemoadsorption (n = 10). Blood samples were collected before and after a single session to measure carboxymethyllysine (CML), soluble RAGE (sRAGE), prolactin, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Reduction ratios (RR) were calculated, including corrected for hemoconcentration (RRc), to ensure accuracy. Statistical analyses included Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: The HF-HD plus hemoadsorption group showed significantly enhanced removal of CML compared to HF-HD alone, with RRc of 64.7% [52.6-74.9] versus 39.3% [33.8-49.4], respectively (p = 0.045). Similarly, uncorrected reduction ratios demonstrated a trend favoring hemoadsorption, with values of 57.5% [45.1-70.7] versus 30.3% [19.1-44.5] (p = 0.053). Importantly, sRAGE levels were preserved in both groups (RRc: 23.4% (15.1-30.4) vs. 21.8% (16.6-31.7), p = 0.791), highlighting the safety of hemoadsorption. Other biochemical parameters, including prolactin, PTH, albumin, and electrolytes, showed no significant differences between groups. All sessions were completed without adverse events. CONCLUSION: Combining hemoadsorption with HF-HD significantly enhances CML removal, as evidenced by corrected RR, without compromising protective sRAGE levels. This innovative approach offers a promising adjunctive therapy for reducing AGEs-related complications in end-stage renal disease patients. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate long-term outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic chronic foot ulcers pose a significant therapeutic challenge around the world, resulting in adverse effects and complications in patients. D-mannose is enriched in cirtus peel and exerts beneficial effects among various diseases, especially against inflammation-related disorders. METHODS: Here, we examined the potential effect of D-mannose during wound healing process in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mice in vivo and by culturing keratinocytes under high glucose condition in vitro. The skin lesion healing was recorded in photos and evaluated by histochemical staining. What's more, the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) concentration in blood and mice skin was quantified. Apoptotic cells were assessed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Inflammatory cytokines and cellular differential gene expression levels were measured by real-time PCR. The expression of the AMPK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling-related molecules was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: We first found that topical supplementation of D-mannose remarkably improved skin wound healing in diabetes mice. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that D-mannose reduced the AGEs generation. Mechanistically, D-mannose inhibited AGEs, then upregulated AMPK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in the context of high glucose to maintain keratinocyte normal functions, which positively influenced macrophage and fibroblast to accelerate diabetic wound healing. Noteworthily, these protective effects of D-mannose were abolished by the pretreatment with inhibitors of AGEs or AMPK. CONCLUSION: As far as we know, this is the first study exploring the protective role of D-mannose on diabetic wound healing via topical supplementation. We find that D-mannose protects keratinocytes from high glucose stimulation via inhibition of AGEs formation as well as orchestrates inflammatory microenvironment in diabetic wounded skin, suggesting its supplementation as a potential therapy to promote refractory wound healing in diabetic patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) play a critical role in the development of vascular diseases in diabetes. Although stem cell therapies often involve exposure to AGEs, the impact of this environment on extracellular vesicles (EVs) and endothelial cell metabolism remains unclear. METHODS: Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were treated with either 0 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml AGEs in a serum-free medium for 48 hours, after which MSC-EVs were isolated. The EVs were characterized by morphology, particle size, and protein markers of MSC-EVs, and microRNA (miRNA) sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. MSC-EVs were cocultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to assess effects on cell viability, metabolic activity, oxidative stress, and antioxidant capacity. Tube formation and glucose transporter protein analyses were conducted to evaluate the angiogenic ability and glucose metabolism capacity. RESULTS: MSC-EVs ranged from 30 to 150 nm, which is consistent with exosomal properties. AGEs treatment reduced MSC viability but had minimal effect on EV morphology and protein markers. miRNA sequencing showed downregulation of hsa-miR-223-3p and hsa-miR-126-3p_R-1, with upregulation of hsa-miR-574-5p, implicating changes in glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. MSC-EVs treated with AGEs decreased HUVEC viability (P < 0.05), pH (P < 0.05), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolism (P < 0.05), glucose metabolism (P < 0.05), while enhancing glycolysis processes, including glycolytic activity, capacity, and reserve (P < 0.05). This likely resulted from impaired mitochondrial function, including reduced ATP production, maximal respiration, basal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity (P < 0.05), or increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) (P < 0.05) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity (P < 0.05). In addition, AGEs reduced glucose transporter types 1, 3, and 4 (GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT4), and synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 expression (P < 0.05), along with angiogenic capacity (P < 0.05) in HUVECs. CONCLUSION: Exposure to AGEs diminishes the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived EVs by disrupting energy metabolism and promoting metabolic reprogramming in endothelial cells. These findings suggest that adjusting the dosage or frequency of MSC-EVs may enhance their efficacy for treating diabetes-related vascular conditions. Further research is warranted to evaluate AGEs' broader impact on various cell types and metabolic pathways for improved exosome-based therapies."

      "abstract": "In recent years, stem cell therapy has become a pivotal component of regenerative medicine. Stem cells, characterized by their self-renewal capacity and multidirectional differentiation potential, can be isolated from a variety of biological tissues, including adipose tissue, bone marrow, the umbilical cord, and the placenta. The classic applications of stem cells include human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, numerous factors can influence the normal physiological function of stem cells. For instance, in diabetes mellitus, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in the extracellular matrix (ECM), impairing the physiological function of stem cells. These substances are closely associated with aging and the progression of numerous degenerative diseases. AGEs can create an environment that is detrimental to the normal physiological functions of stem cells. By binding to the primary cellular receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), AGEs disrupt the physiological activities of stem cells. The binding of RAGE to various ligands triggers the activation of downstream signaling pathways, contributing to the pathophysiological development of diabetes, aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Therefore, there is an urgent need for comprehensive research on the impact of AGEs on stem cells, which could provide new insights into the therapeutic application of stem cells in regenerative medicine."

      "abstract": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are produced in foods during their thermal treatment through routes like the Maillard reaction. They have been linked to various health issues such as diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. There are multiple pathways through which AGEs can form in foods and the body. Therefore, this review work aims to explore multiple formation pathways of AGEs to gain insights into their generation mechanisms. Furthermore, this review work has analyzed the recent trends in the detection and inhibition of AGEs in food matrices. It can be highlighted, based on the surveyed literature, that UHPLC-Orbitrap-Q-Exactive-MS and UPLC-ESI-MS/MS can produce highly sensitive results with a low limit of detection levels for AGEs in food matrices. Moreover, various works on inhibitory agents like spices, herbs, fruits, vegetables, hydrocolloids, plasma-activated water, and probiotic bacteria were assessed for their capacity to suppress the formation of AGEs in food products and simulation models. Overall, it is essential to decrease the occurrence of AGEs in food products, and future scope might include studying the interaction of macromolecular components in food products to minimize the production of AGEs without sacrificing the organoleptic qualities of processed foods."

      "abstract": "KEY POINTS: Our study revealed that high mobility group box 1 activates the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in AKI. MR antagonists and RAGE aptamers inhibited high mobility group box 1–induced Rac1/MR activation and downstream inflammatory molecules in endothelial cells. MR antagonists and RAGE aptamers may represent promising therapeutic strategies for preventing AKI and CKD progression. BACKGROUND: Although AKI is associated with an increased risk of CKD, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), one of the ligands for the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), is elevated in patients with AKI. We recently demonstrated that the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is activated by the RAGE/Rac1 pathway, contributing to chronic renal damage in hypertensive mice. Therefore, this study investigated the role of the HMGB1/RAGE/MR pathway in AKI and progression to CKD. METHODS: We performed a mouse model of renal ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) with or without MR antagonist (MRA). In vitro experiments were conducted using cultured endothelial cells to examine the interaction between the HMGB1/RAGE and Rac1/MR pathways. RESULTS: In renal I/R injury mice, renal MR activation was associated with elevated serum HMGB1, renal RAGE, and activated Rac1, all of which were suppressed by MRA. Renal I/R injury led to renal dysfunction, tubulointerstitial injury, and increased expressions of inflammation and fibrosis mediators, which were ameliorated by MRA. In vitro, RAGE aptamer or MRA inhibited HMGB1-induced Rac1/MR activation and upregulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and NF-κB expressions. Seven days after I/R injury, renal I/R injury mice developed CKD, whereas MRA prevented renal injury progression and decreased the mortality rate. Furthermore, in case of MRA treatment even after I/R injury, attenuated renal dysfunction compared with untreated mice was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that HMGB1 may play a crucial role in AKI and CKD development by activating the Rac1/MR pathway through interactions with RAGE."

      "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic interface controlling the compound translocation between the blood and the brain, thereby maintaining neural homeostasis. There is cumulative evidence that BBB impairment during diabetes mellitus (DM) takes part in the progression of cognitive dementia. As tight junction proteins and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters regulate substance exchange between the circulating blood and brain, the expression and function of these molecules under DM should be fully clarified. To understand the alteration of ABC transporter function in the BBB under DM, in vitro multicellular rat BBB spheroids consisting of conditionally immortalized rat brain capillary endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes were newly developed. Immunostaining and permeability analysis of paracellular transport markers suggested the construction of tight junctions on the surface of the BBB spheroids. Transport analyses using fluorescence substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) indicate the functional expression of these transporters in the spheroids. After treatment with advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), involved in various signals during DM, the mRNA expression of tight junction molecules and ABC transporters in the BBB spheroids was upregulated. Furthermore, the functional changes in P-gp and BCRP in the BBB spheroids exposed to AGEs were canceled by the inhibitors of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). These results suggest that AGE-RAGE interaction upregulates P-gp and BCRP function in the BBB.",

      "abstract": "Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) are formed through non-enzymatic reactions between reducing sugars and proteins, nucleic acids or lipids (for example through hyperoxidation). In diabetes, elevated glucose levels provide more substrate for AGEs formation. AGEs can also be ingested through the diet from foods cooked at high temperatures, or containing much sugar. The present work aimed to review all published randomized controlled trials (RCT) on low-dietary AGE (L-dAGEs) interventions in patients with diabetes. Pubmed, Scopus and Cochrane databases were searched (until 29 February 2024) with appropriate keywords (inclusion criteria: RCT, patients with diabetes, age > 18 years, outcomes related to inflammation, glucose, and lipids; exclusion criteria: non-RCTs, case-series, case reports and Letter to the Editor, or animal studies). The present review was registered to the Open Science Framework (OSF). From 7091 studies, seven were ultimately included. Bias was assessed with the updated Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. A reduction in circulating AGEs was documented in 3/3 studies. No particular differences were documented in glycemic parameters after a L-dAGEs diet. Reductions in glucose levels were observed in one out of six studies (1/6), while HbA1c and HOMA did not change in any study (0/6 and 0/3, correspondingly). Lipid profile also changed in one out of four studies (1/4). More consistent results were observed for oxidative stress (beneficial effects in 3/3 studies) and inflammatory markers (beneficial effects in 4/4 studies). Other athero-protective effects, such as adiponectin increases, were reported. Limitations included the small sample size and the fact that dietary and physical activity habits were not considered in most studies. In conclusion, a L-dAGEs pattern may minimize AGEs accumulation and have beneficial effects on oxidative stress and inflammation indices, while its effects on glycemic and lipemic parameters are inconsistent and modest in patients with diabetes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence supports the role of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in atherosclerosis in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting AGEs may offer potential benefits in this population. The Mediterranean diet is associated with improved biomarkers and anthropometric measurements related with atherosclerosis in addition to its ability to modulate AGE metabolism. Our aim was to determine whether the reduction in atherosclerosis progression (measured by changes in intima-media thickness of both common carotid arteries (IMT-CC)), observed after consumption of a Mediterranean diet compared to a low-fat diet, is associated with a modulation of circulating AGE levels in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS: 1002 CHD patients were divided in: (1) Non-increased IMT-CC patients, whose IMT-CC was reduced or not changed after dietary intervention and (2) Increased IMT-CC patients, whose IMT-CC was increased after dietary intervention. Serum AGE levels (methylglyoxal-MG and Nε-Carboxymethyllysine-CML) and parameters related to AGE metabolism (AGER1 and GloxI mRNA and sRAGE levels) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were measured before and after 5-years of dietary intervention. RESULTS: The Mediterranean diet did not affect MG levels, whereas the low-fat diet significantly increased them compared to baseline (p = 0.029), leading to lower MG levels following the Mediterranean diet than the low-fat diet (p < 0.001). The Mediterranean diet, but not the low-fat diet, produced an upregulation of AGE metabolism, with increased AGER1 and GloxI gene expression as well as increased GSH and sRAGE levels in Non-increased IMT-CC patients (all p < 0.05). Although the Mediterranean diet increased MG levels in Increased IMT-CC patients, this increment was lower compared to the low-fat diet (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an improvement in modulation of AGE metabolism, which facilitates better management of circulating AGE levels, may be one of the mechanisms through which the Mediterranean diet, compared to a low-fat diet, reduces the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with CHD.

      "abstract": "Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is a common complication after cataract surgery. Residual lens epithelial cells (LECs) on the anterior lens capsule, after cataract surgery, migrate to the posterior lens capsule and undergo transdifferentiation into myofibroblast-like cells. Those cells synthesize excessive amounts of extracellular matrix and contribute to fibrosis during PCO. Cellular senescence, a phenomenon that increases with aging, has been implicated in several fibrotic diseases. Here, we have investigated the prevalence of senescent LECs within the lens posterior capsule and the ability of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in lens capsules to induce senescence, contributing to PCO. Aged lens capsules from pseudophakic human cadaver eyes showed the presence of senescent LECs. In human capsular bags, LECs showed an age-dependent increase in senescence after 28 days of culture. Human LECs cultured on aged lens capsules for 3 days underwent senescence; this effect was not seen in LECs cultured on young lens capsules. Human LECs cultured on an AGE-modified extracellular matrix (ECM-AGEs) showed an AGE-concentration-dependent increase in the expression of senescence markers and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Treatment with a RAGE antagonist and ROS inhibitor reduced the expression of senescence and fibrotic markers. Additionally, conditioned media from ECM-AGEs-treated cells induced the expression of fibrotic markers in naïve LECs. Together, these suggest that AGEs in the capsule induce senescence of LECs, which triggers the mesenchymal transition of neighboring non-senescent LECs and contributes to PCO.",

One of the deleterious effects of AGEs is the induction of abnormal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in skeletal muscle. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate how AGEs induce ROS production in skeletal muscle cells. This study demonstrated that AGEs treatment promoted ROS production in myoblasts and myotubes while PKC inhibitor abolished ROS production by AGEs stimulation. Phosphorylation of p47 phox by kinases such as PKCα is required to form the Nox2 complex, which induces ROS production. In this study, AGEs treatment promoted the phosphorylation of PKCα and p47 phox in myoblasts and myotubes. Our findings suggest that AGEs promote ROS production through the phosphorylation of PKCα and p47 phox in skeletal muscle cells.",

Gastric cancer is a malignancy emanating from the epithelial lining of the gastric mucosa and one of the most prevalent forms of cancer worldwide. The development of gastric cancer is associated with multiple risk factors, including Helicobacter pylori infection, advanced age, a diet rich in salt, and suboptimal eating patterns. Despite notable reductions in morbidity and mortality rates, gastric cancer remains a formidable public health concern, impacting patients' lives. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are complex compounds arising from nonenzymatic reactions within living organisms, the accumulation of which is implicated in cellular and tissue damage; thus, the levels are AGEs are correlated with the risk of diverse diseases. The investigation of AGEs is of paramount importance for the treatment of gastric cancer and can provide pivotal insights into disease pathogenesis and preventive and therapeutic strategies. The reduction of AGEs levels and suppression of their accumulation are promising avenues for mitigating the risk of gastric cancer. This approach underscores the need for further research aimed at identifying innovative interventions that can effectively lower the incidence and mortality rates of this malignancy."

Therefore, this work conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effect of dietary AGE intake on the biomarkers of T2DM, the available evidence, and the bias of this evidence. This meta-analysis focused on the association between high AGE intake and fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR. Thirteen parallel studies and 4 randomized crossover studies were finally included. In the pooled analysis, fasting glucose (SMD: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.23, 1.73; p = .011), fasting insulin (SMD: 1.44; 95% CI: 0.63, 2.25; p < .01), and HOMA-IR (SMD: 1.47; 95% CI: 0.59, 2.34; p < .01) significantly increased after dietary intake with high AGEs. In the subgroup analyses, high-AGE diets and healthy participants were associated with changes in the biomarkers of T2DM. Taken together, the intake of high dietary AGE was related to the development of T2DM."

      "abstract": "Dietary advanced glycation end-products (dAGEs) accumulate in organs and are thought to initiate chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI), induce glycoxidative stress, drive immunosenescence, and influence gut microbiota. Part of the toxicological interest in glycation products such as dietary carboxymethyl-lysine (dCML) relies on their interaction with receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). It remains uncertain whether early or lifelong exposure to dAGEs contributes physiological changes and whether such effects are reversible or permanent. Our objective was to examine the physiological changes in Wild-Type (WT) and RAGE KO mice that were fed either a standard diet (STD - 20.8 ± 5.1 µg dCML/g) or a diet enriched with dCML (255.2 ± 44.5 µg dCML/g) from the perinatal period for up to 70 weeks. Additionally, an early age (6 weeks) diet switch (dCML→STD) was explored to determine whether potential harmful effects of dCML could be reversed. Previous dCML accumulation patterns described by our group were confirmed here, with significant RAGE-independent accumulation of dCML in kidneys, ileum and colon over the 70-week dietary intervention (respectively 3-fold, 17-fold and 20-fold increases compared with controls). Diet switching returned tissue dCML concentrations to their baseline levels. The dCML-enriched diet had no significative effect on endogenous glycation, inflammation, oxidative stress or senescence parameters. The relative expression of TNFα, VCAM1, IL6, and P16 genes were all upregulated (∼2-fold) in an age-dependent manner, most notably in the kidneys of WT animals. RAGE knockout seemed protective in this regard, diminishing age-related renal expression of TNFα. Significant increases in TNFα expression were detectable in the intestinal tract of the Switch group (∼2-fold), suggesting a higher sensitivity to inflammation perhaps related to the timing of the diet change. Minor fluctuations were observed at family level within the caecal microbiota, including Eggerthellaceae, Anaerovoracaceae and Marinifilaceae communities, indicating slight changes in composition. Despite chronic dCML consumption resulting in higher free CML levels in tissues, there were no substantial increases in parameters related to inflammageing. Age was a more important factor in inflammation status, notably in the kidneys, while the early-life dietary switch may have influenced intestinal susceptibility to inflammation. This study affirms the therapeutic potential of RAGE modulation and corroborates evidence for the disruptive effect of dietary changes occurring too early in life. Future research should prioritize the potential influence of dAGEs on disease aetiology and development, notably any exacerbating effects they may have upon existing health conditions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) are essential for follicular development. Ovarian advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) accumulation is related to GCs dysfunction. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) illustrates therapeutic capabilities for infertility-related disorders. Therefore, this study assessed the effects of ALA on AGEs-induced GCs hormonal dysfunction. METHODS: The study was conducted from October 2021 to September 2022 at the Department of Medical Genetics, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Isolated GCs (n=50) were divided into control, human glycated albumin (HGA), HGA+ALA, and ALA treatments. Steroidogenic enzymes and AGE receptor (RAGE) genes were assessed by qRT-PCR. Steroid hormones and RAGE protein were evaluated using ELISA and Western blotting. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (ver. 9), and P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Our findings showed that HGA treatment significantly (P=0.0001) increased RAGE (by 140.66%), STAR (by 117.65%), 3β-HSD (by 165.68%), and 17β-HSD (by 122.15%) expression, while it decreased CYP19A1 (by 68.37%) expression. RAGE protein level (by 267.10%) was also increased in HGA-treated GCs. A significant decrease in estradiol (by 59.66%) and a slight and sharp elevation in progesterone (by 30.40%) and total testosterone (by 158.24%) levels was also observed. ALA treatment ameliorated the HGA-induced changes in steroidogenic enzyme mRNA levels (P=0.001) and steroid hormone secretion (P=0.010). CONCLUSION: This work shows that ALA therapy likely corrects hormonal dysfunctions caused by AGEs in luteinized GCs. This effect is probably achieved by decreased RAGE expression. Clinical research is needed to understand how AGEs and ALA interact in the ovary, which might lead to a more targeted ovarian dysfunction therapy.",

This is a one-month controlled dietary counseling trial that restricts nutritional AGEs in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing haemodialysis (n = 22 participants in the intervention and n = 20 participants in the control group). Haematological, biochemical markers, the soluble form of the receptor for AGEs (sRAGE), and carboxymethyl lysine (CML) were measured at baseline and at follow-up. Mononuclear cells were isolated and the protein expression of RAGE and the inflammatory marker COX-2 was measured using Western immunoblotting. The intervention group presented a lower increase in CML compared to the control group (12.39% median change in the intervention vs. 69.34% in the control group, p = 0.013), while RAGE (% mean change -56.54 in the intervention vs. 46.51 in the control group, p < 0.001) and COX-2 (% mean change -37.76 in the intervention vs. 0.27 in the control group, p < 0.001) were reduced compared to the control group. sRAGE was reduced in both groups. In addition, HbA1c (at two months), total cholesterol, and triglycerides were reduced in the intervention versus the control group. The adoption of healthy cooking methods deserves further research as a possible way of modulating inflammatory markers in patients with CKD.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is a common malignant tumor that is closely associated with metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are complex polymers formed by the reaction of reducing sugars with the amino groups of biomacromolecules, mediating the occurrence and development of many chronic metabolic diseases. Recent research has demonstrated that the accumulation of AGEs can affect the tumor microenvironment, metabolism, and signaling pathways, thereby affecting the malignant progression of tumors. However, the mechanism by which AGEs affect EC is unclear. Our research aimed to investigate how AGEs promote the development of EC through metabolic pathways and to explore their potential underlying mechanisms. Our experimental results demonstrated that AGEs upregulated the choline metabolism mediated by choline kinase alpha (CHKA) through the receptor for advanced glycation end products, activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and enhancing the malignant biological behavior of EC cells. Virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation revealed that timosaponin A3 could target CHKA to inhibit AGE-induced progression of EC and that a newly discovered CHKA inhibitor could be a novel targeted inhibitor for the treatment of EC. This study provides new therapeutic strategies and contributes to the treatment of EC.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized cross-over trial, 62 overweight adults were assigned to a Mediterranean or a low-fat vegan diet for 16-week periods in random order, separated by a 4-week washout. Body weight was the primary outcome. Three-day diet records were analyzed using the Nutrition Data System for Research software and dietary AGEs were estimated, using an established database. Statistical approaches appropriate for crossover trials were implemented. RESULTS: Dietary AGEs decreased by 73%, that is, by 9,413 kilounits AGE/day (95% -10,869 to -7,957); p < 0.001, compared with no change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect -10,303 kilounits AGE/day [95% CI -13,090 to -7,516]; p < 0.001). The participants lost 6.0 kg on average on the vegan diet, compared with no change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect -6.0 kg [95% CI -7.5 to -4.5]; p < 0.001). Changes in dietary AGEs correlated with changes in body weight (r = +0.47; p < 0.001) and remained significant after adjustment for total energy intake (r = +0.39; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Dietary AGEs did not change on the Mediterranean diet but decreased on a low-fat vegan diet, and this decrease was associated with changes in body weight, independent of energy intake.

This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) at the Baihui (GV20) and Zusanli (ST36) acupoints in protecting white matter. Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) rat models. Comprehensive motor functions were assessed using the mesh experiment. Morphological changes in the myelin sheath were assessed with Luxol fast blue staining. Morphological changes in oligodendrocytes and myelinated axons were evaluated using Nissl staining. The expressions of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the corpus callosum were detected by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. pMCAO caused severe injury to the corpus callosum, evidenced by significant loss of white matter fibers and myelinated axons, and induced overexpression of HMGB1 and RAGE in the corpus callosum. EA treatment significantly improved comprehensive motor function alleviated white matter damage, and downregulated the expression of HMGB1 and RAGE. Its effects were comparable to those of FPS-ZM1, a RAGE receptor inhibitor. In conclusion, EA effectively improves comprehensive motor function in rats with cerebral infarction and alleviates corpus callosum injury. This effect may be related to the inhibition of HMGB1 and RAGE overexpression.",

METHODS: To illustrate potential effect of GLP-1R agonist on AGEs induced chondrocytes, chondrocytes were administrated by AGEs with LIRA and GLP-1R inhibitor exendin. Inflammatory factors were assessed using ELISA. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the catabolic activity MMPs and ADAMTS mRNA level, as well as anabolic activity (aggrecan and collagen II). RAGE expression was investigated by Western blotting. TUNEL, caspase3 activity and immunofluorescence were performed to test the apoptotic activity. RESULTS: Our results showed that treatment with LIRA at > 100 nM attenuated the AGE-induced chondrocyte viability. Western bolt demonstrated that GLP-1R activation by LIRA treatment reduced RAGE protein expression compared with the AGEs groups. ELISA showed that LIRA hindered the AGEs-induced production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α) in primary chondrocytes. AGEs induced catabolism levels (MMP-1, -3, -13 and ADAMTS-4, 5) are also attenuated by LIRA, causing the retention of more extracellular matrix (Aggrecan and Collagen II). TUNEL, caspase3 activity and immunofluorescence results indicated that LIRA inhibited the AGEs-induced production of inflammatory cytokines in primary chondrocytes and attenuated the caspase 3 level, leading to the reduced apoptotic activity. All the protective effects are reversed by exendin (GLP-1R blockers). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates for the first time that LIRA, an agonist for GLP-1R which is commonly used in type 2 diabetes reverses AGEs induced chondrocyte inflammation and apoptosis through suppressing RAGE signaling, contributing to reduced catabolism and retention of more extracellular matrix. The above results indicate the possible effect of GLP-1R agonist on treating OA.",

How plasma sRAGE changes over time and whether it remains associated with long-term clinical outcomes beyond a single measurement in COVID-19 have not been well studied. We studied two cohorts in randomized clinical trials of monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19 (bamlanivimab and tixagevimab/cilgavimab). We first studied the association between baseline plasma sRAGE and 90-day clinical outcomes, which had been previously demonstrated in the bamlanivimab cohort, among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 supported with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in the tixagevimab/cilgavimab study. Next, we investigated the relationship between day 3 sRAGE and 90-day outcomes and how plasma sRAGE changes over the first 3 days of hospitalization in both clinical trial cohorts. We found that plasma sRAGE in the highest quartile in the HFNO/NIV participants in the tixagevimab/cilgavimab trial was associated with a significantly lower rate of 90-day sustained recovery [recovery rate ratio = 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14-0.71, P = 0.005] and with a significantly higher rate of 90-day mortality (hazard ratio = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.15-5.43, P = 0.021) compared with the lower three quartiles. Day 3 plasma sRAGE in both clinical trial cohorts remained associated with 90-day clinical outcomes. The trajectory of sRAGE was not influenced by treatment assignment. Our results indicate that plasma sRAGE is a valuable prognostic marker in COVID-19 up to 3 days after initial hospital presentation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) is a marker of alveolar type I epithelial cell injury associated with clinical outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome and, more recently, in hospitalized subjects with COVID-19.

This study aims to determine the impact of AGEs on tendon repair and explore the role of pioglitazone in mitigating this impact. METHODS: Forty-eight male 8 week-old Sprague Dawley rats were selected in this study. After transection of Achilles tendon, the rats were randomly divided into four groups. The Achilles tendons of rats were injected with 1000 mmol/L D-ribose to elevate the content of AGEs within the tendons in two groups, the remaining two groups received injections of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. Subsequently, the first two groups were respectively received oral administration of pioglitazone (20 mg/kg/day) and PBS. The remaining two groups were given the same treatment. The expression of the collagen-I, TNF-α, IL-6 of the repaired tendon were detected. The macroscopic, pathologic and biomechanical aspects of tendon healing were also evaluated. RESULTS: AGEs accumulation in tendon during the healing process increases the expression of inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-6, leading to insufficient synthesis of collagen-I and delayed recovery of the tendon's tensile strength. Pioglitazone significantly attenuated the damage caused by AGEs to the tendon healing process, effectively improving the recovery of tendon tensile strength. Pioglitazone could not inhibit the generation of AGEs in the tissue and also had no impact on the normal healing process of the tendon. CONCLUSIONS: Pioglitazone could prevent the deleterious impact of AGEs on the Achilles tendon healing and improve the biomechanical properties of the tendon."

Several factors play an important role as an inducer to diabetic nephropathy, and AGEs elicit their harmful effects via interacting with the receptor for AGEs Receptor for AGEs, by induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and fibrosis in the kidney tissues leading to the loss of renal function. Insulin resistance results in the activation of other alternate pathways governed by insulin, which results in the hypertrophy of the renal cells and tissue remodeling. Apart from the glucose uptake and disposal, insulin dependent PI3K and Akt also upregulate the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, that results in increasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide in the vascular endothelium, which further results in tissue fibrosis. Considering the global prevalence of diabetic nephropathy, and the impact of protein glycation, various inhibitors and treatment avenues are being developed, to prevent the progression of diabetic complications. In this chapter, we discuss the role of glycation in insulin resistance and further its impact on the kidney.",

Accordingly, our objective was to investigate the impact of AGE-promoting diets on mouse models, considering both scenarios with and without methylglyoxal (MGO) as a primary precursor of AGEs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, 5-week-old C57BL/6 mice were split into four groups as a control group (n=5), AGE (n=5), MGO (n=8), and AGE-MGO-diets (n=8). After five weeks the level of fasting blood sugar (FBS), body weight, food intake, sperm parameters, and functional tests were evaluated. Furthermore, testicular superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were assessed. RESULTS: After five weeks, AGE, AGE-MGO, and MGO groups showed the highest level of body weight and FBS in comparison to the control group. Mean sperm concentration, sperm malondialdehyde, testicular lipid peroxidation, and TAC did not differ significantly among the study groups. While, AGE, MGO, and AGE-MGO groups showed a significant reduction in sperm motility and progressive motility compared to the control group (P<0.05). The greatest increases in abnormal sperm morphology and intracytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed in the MGO and AGE-MGO groups than in the control group (P<0.05). Sperm protamine deficiency and residual histone were significantly increased in the three treatment groups compared to the control group (P<0.05). Regarding the DNA damage, the AGE and AGE-MGO groups showed the most severe damage. The lowest amount of testicular superoxide dismutases (SOD, P<0.001) was observed in the AGE-MGO group. CONCLUSION: AGEs and MGO have a negative influence on sperm function and reproductive potential. These effects could be possibly attributed to both increased oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation."

      "abstract": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in the brain, leading to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathophysiology of AD is influenced by receptors for AGEs and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Protein glycation results in irreversible AGEs through a complicated series of reactions involving the formation of Schiff's base, the Amadori reaction, followed by the Maillard reaction, which causes abnormal brain glucose metabolism, oxidative stress, malfunctioning mitochondria, plaque deposition, and neuronal death. Amyloid plaque and other stimuli activate macrophages, which are crucial immune cells in AD development, triggering the production of inflammatory molecules and contributing to the disease's pathogenesis. The risk of AD is doubled by risk factors for atherosclerosis, dementia, advanced age, and type 2 diabetic mellitus (DM). As individuals age, the prevalence of neurological illnesses such as AD increases due to a decrease in glyoxalase levels and an increase in AGE accumulation. Insulin's role in proteostasis influences hallmarks of AD-like tau phosphorylation and amyloid β peptide clearance, affecting lipid metabolism, inflammation, vasoreactivity, and vascular function. The high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, a key initiator and activator of a neuroinflammatory response, has been linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. The TLR4 inhibitor was found to improve memory and learning impairment and decrease Aβ build-up. Therapeutic research into anti-glycation agents, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) inhibitors, and AGE breakers offers hope for intervention strategies. Dietary and lifestyle modifications can also slow AD progression. Newer therapeutic approaches targeting AGE-related pathways are needed."

      "abstract": "Introduction: As inhibitors of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), such as pyridoxamine, significantly inhibit the development of retinopathy and neuropathy in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, treatment with AGE inhibitors is believed to be a potential strategy for the prevention of aging, age-related diseases, and lifestyle-related diseases, including diabetic complications. In the present study, the MeOH extract of Epimedii Herba (EH; aerial parts of Epimedium spp.) was found to inhibit the formation of N ε -(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and N ω -(carboxymethyl) arginine (CMA) during the incubation of collagen-derived gelatin with ribose. Materials and methods: EH was purchased from Uchida Wakan-yaku Co., and a MeOH extract was prepared. Several steps of column chromatography purified the extract. Each fraction was tested for inhibitory activity by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies for CML and CMA. Results: After activity-guided fractionation and purification by column chromatography, three new prenylflavonoids [named Koreanoside L (1), Koreanoside E1 (2), and Koreanoside E2 (3)] and 40 known compounds (4-43) were isolated from EH, and their inhibitory effects against CML and CMA formation were tested. Among these, epimedokoreanin B (8), epimedonin E (21), epicornunin B (22), and epicornunin F (24) inhibited the formation of both CML and CMA, with epimedokoreanin B (8) having the most potent inhibitory effect among the isolated compounds. To obtain the structure-activity relationships of 8, the phenolic hydroxy groups of 8 were methylated by trimethylsilyl-diazomethane to afford the partially and completely methylated compounds of 8. Prenyl derivatives of propolis (artepillin C, baccharin, and drupanin) were used in the assay. Discussion: As only 8 showed significant activity among these compounds, the catechol group of the B ring and the two prenyl groups attached to the flavanone skeleton were essential for activity. These data suggest that 8 could prevent the clinical complications of diabetes and age-related diseases by inhibiting AGEs."

In this study, the ability of plasma-activated water (PAW) to simultaneously mitigate production of HAAs and AGEs in roasted beef patties was investigated.

PAW treatment decreased the contents of free HAAs, free AGEs, bound HAAs, and bound AGEs to 12.65 ng/g, 0.10 μg/g, 297.74 ng/g, and 4.32 μg/g, with the inhibition rates of 23.88%, 23.08%, 11.02%, and 8.47%, respectively. PAW treatment decreased HAAs and AGEs and mitigated their increase during storage. The decrease of HAAs and AGEs in PAW-treated samples was correlated with the enhancement of antioxidant capacity. The increase of free radical scavenging ability by PAW treatment led to the decrease of lipid peroxidation and the decrease of active carbonyls, HAAs, and AGEs in meat products.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic medical condition affecting more than 95% of people with diabetes. Traditionally, some medicinal plants have been considered as an effective approach in management of T2DM. This trial evaluated the effects of date seed powder (DSP) on glycemia indices and oxidative stress in T2DM patients. METHODS: In this trail, 43 patients with T2DM were randomized to two groups: either 5 g/d of the DSP or placebo for 8 weeks. Levels of glycemic indices, lipolpolysaccharide (LPS), and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (s-RAGE), as well as other parameters associated with oxidative stress were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Independent t-test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used for between-groups comparisons at baseline and the post-intervention phase, respectively. RESULTS: The results showed that supplementation with DSP significantly decreased HbA1c (-0.30 ± 0.48%), insulin (-1.70 ± 2.21 μU/ml), HOMA-IR (-1.05 ± 0.21), HOMA-B (-0.76 ± 21.21), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (-3.68 ± 6.05 EU/mL), and pentosidine (118.99 ± 21.67 pg/mL) (P < 0.05, ANCOVA adjusted for baseline and confounding factors). On the other hand, DSP supplementation significantly increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (0.50 ± 0.26 mmol/L), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (0.69 ± 0.32 U/ml), and s-RAGE (240.13 ± 54.25 pg/mL) compared to the placebo group. FPG, hs-CRP, GPx, CML, and uric acid had no significant within- or between-group changes. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of DSP could be considered an effective strategy to improve glycemic control and oxidative stress in T2DM patients (Registration ID at www.irct.ir : IRCT20150205020965N10).",

      "abstract": "Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a highly reactive α-dicarbonyl compound formed endogenously from 3-carbon glycolytic intermediates. Methylglyoxal accumulated in plasma and urine of hyperglycemic and diabetic individuals acts as a potent peptide glycation molecule, giving rise to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) like arginine-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1) and carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL). Methylglyoxal-derived AGEs exert their effects mostly via activation of RAGE, a cell surface receptor that initiates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, favoring a pro-oxidant environment through NADPH oxidase activation and generation of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Diabetic bladder dysfunction is a bothersome urological complication in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and may comprise overactive bladder, urge incontinence, poor emptying, dribbling, incomplete emptying of the bladder, and urinary retention. Preclinical models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes have further confirmed the relationship between diabetes and voiding dysfunction. Interestingly, healthy mice supplemented with MGO for prolonged periods exhibit in vivo and in vitro bladder dysfunction, which is accompanied by increased AGE formation and RAGE expression, as well as by ROS overproduction in bladder tissues. Drugs reported to scavenge MGO and to inactivate AGEs like metformin, polyphenols, and alagebrium (ALT-711) have shown favorable outcomes on bladder dysfunction in diabetic obese leptin-deficient and MGO-exposed mice. Therefore, MGO, AGEs, and RAGE levels may be critically involved in the pathogenesis of bladder dysfunction in diabetic individuals. However, there are no clinical trials designed to test drugs that selectively inhibit the MGO-AGEs-RAGE signaling, aiming to reduce the manifestations of diabetes-associated bladder dysfunction. This review summarizes the current literature on the role of MGO-AGEs-RAGE-ROS axis in diabetes-associated bladder dysfunction. Drugs that directly inactivate MGO and ameliorate bladder dysfunction are also reviewed here."

AGEs, glucose, 25(OH) vitamin D, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities were evaluated in FF. The expression of 3βHSD, CYP11A1, and CYP19A1 genes were analyzed in granulosa cells (GCs) by qRT-PCR technique. Morphokinetic parameters were evaluated using time-lapse technology. The FF level of AGEs was reversely associated with CAT, SOD, and GPX activities, and total and mature oocytes number, blastocyst formation rate, and high-grade embryos number, while it showed positive correlations with the FF MDA levels, the expression of steroidogenesis genes, number of immature oocytes, morphokinetic parameters, and number of low-grade embryos. Furthermore, the level of vitamin D in FF had an inverse association with AGEs and positive correlations with ART outcomes and morphokinetic parameters. Comparison between the those with positive and negative biochemical pregnancy showed no significant differences in terms of FF factors and just the expression of 3βHSD, CYP11A1, and CYP19A1 genes were higher in pregnant women (p < 0.05). AGEs could delay blastomere division and lead to an increase in the number of low-quality embryos, while vitamin D have an adverse effect on AGEs and a protective function against AGEs negative effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the implication of receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) has been reported in coronary artery disease, its roles in coronary artery ectasia (CAE) have remained undetermined. Furthermore, the effect of RAGE polymorfisms were not well-defined in scope of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) levels. Thus, we aimed to investigate the influence of the functional polymorphisms of RAGE -374T > A (rs1800624) and G82S (rs2070600) in CAE development. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in 2 groups selected of 2452 patients who underwent elective coronary angiography (CAG) for evaluation after positive noninvasive heart tests. Group-I included 98 patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease and CAE, and Group-II (control) included 100 patients with normal coronary arteries. SNPs were genotyped by real-time PCR using Taqman® genotyping assay. Serum sRAGE and soluble lectin-like oxidized receptor-1 (sOLR1) were assayed by ELISA and serum lipids were measured enzymatically. RESULTS: The frequencies of the RAGE -374A allele and -374AA genotype were significantly higher in CAE patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). sRAGE levels were not different between study groups, while sOLR1 levels were elevated in CAE (p = 0.004). In controls without systemic disease, -374A allele was associated with low sRAGE levels (p < 0.05), but this association was not significant in controls with HT. Similarly, sRAGE levels of CAE patients with both HT and T2DM were higher than those no systemic disease (p = 0.02). The -374A allele was also associated with younger patient age and higher platelet count in the CAE group in both total and subgroup analyses. In the correlation analyses, the -374A allele was also negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with Plt in all of these CAE groups. In the total CAE group, sRAGE levels also showed a positive correlation with age and a negative correlation with HDL-cholesterol levels. On the other hand, a negative correlation was observed between sRAGE and Plt in the total, hypertensive and no systemic disease control subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that the -374A allele (p < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (p < 0.05), and high sOLR1 level (p < 0.05) are risk factors for CAE. ROC curve analysis shows that RAGE -374A allele has AUC of 0.713 (sensitivity: 83.7 %, specificity: 59.0 %), which is higher than HLD (sensitivity: 59.2 %, specificity: 69.0 %), HT (sensitivity: 62.4 %, specificity: 61.1 %) and high sOLR1 level (≥0.67 ng/ml)) (sensitivity: 59.8 %, specificity: 58.5 %). CONCLUSION: Beside the demonstration of the relationship between -374A allele and increased risk of CAE for the first time, our results indicate that antihypertensive and antidiabetic treatment in CAE patients causes an increase in sRAGE levels. The lack of an association between the expected -374A allele and low sRAGE levels in total CAE group was attributed to the high proportion of hypertensive patients and hence to antihypertensive treatment. Moreover, the RAGE -374A allele is associated with younger age at CAE and higher Plt, suggesting that -374A may also be associated with platelet activation, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of CAE. However, our data need to be confirmed in a large study for definitive conclusions.",

In this study, we examined Moraxella keratitis; based on the findings, we investigated the impact of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) deposition in the cornea of individuals with diabetic mellitus on the adhesion of Moraxella isolates to the cornea. A retrospective analysis of 27 culture-proven cases of Moraxella keratitis at Ehime University Hospital (March 2006 to February 2022) was performed. Moraxella isolates were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Among the patients, 30.4% had diabetes mellitus and 22.2% had the predominant ocular condition of using steroid eye drops. The species identified were Moraxella nonliquefaciens in 59.3% and Moraxella lacunata in 40.7% of patients. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we assessed the effects of M. nonliquefaciens adherence to simian virus 40-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) with or without AGEs. The results demonstrated the number of M. nonliquefaciens adhering to HCECs was significantly increased by adding AGEs compared with that in controls (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in the corneas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice treated with or without pyridoxamine, an AGE inhibitor, the number of M. nonliquefaciens adhering to the corneas of diabetic mice was significantly reduced by pyridoxamine treatment (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the development of Moraxella keratitis may be significantly influenced by the deposition of AGEs on the corneal epithelium of patients with diabetes mellitus.",

Five-week-old C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups, one on a regular diet (control) and the other on an AGE-rich diet. After 13 weeks, various parameters were examined, including fasting blood glucose, body weight, food consumption, sperm parameters and function, testicular superoxide dismutase levels, malondialdehyde content, total antioxidant capacity, Johnson score, AGE receptor (RAGE) content, and carboxymethyl lysine (CML) content. The results showed that mice in the AGE group exhibited increased body weight and elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Furthermore, the AGE group displayed adverse effects on sperm, including reduced sperm counts, motility, increased morphological abnormalities, residual histone, protamine deficiency, sperm DNA fragmentation, reduced testicular antioxidant capacity, and higher levels of RAGE and CML proteins. These findings underscore the negative impact of AGEs on male reproductive health, particularly within the context of metabolic disorders, emphasizing the crucial role of the AGE/RAGE axis in male infertility, especially in the context of Western dietary patterns.",

The effects of cooking conditions and seasoning addition on the formation of HAs and AGEs in Chinese traditional braised lamb were investigated by UPLC-MS/MS analysis. Soy sauce significantly increased the formation of HAs and AGEs, among which light soy sauce had the greatest promoting effect (69.45-15300.62 %). Conversely, spices inhibited HAs and AGEs formation, the inhibition rate of free HAs and AGEs reached 22.06-34.72 % when using 70 % ethanol extract. Hot blanching treatment and adding soy sauce and spices at a later stage could significantly suppress HAs and AGEs production. Flavonoids, including galangin, hesperidin, narirutin, etc., were identified as key effectors in spices. These findings help to promote awareness of the formation of HAs and AGEs in braised lamb and provide valuable insights for optimizing processing techniques to minimize their production.",

      "abstract": "The meniscus is vital for maintaining knee homeostasis and function. Meniscal calcification is one of the earliest radiological indicators of knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and meniscal calcification is associated with alterations in biomechanical properties. Meniscal calcification originates from a biochemical process similar to vascular calcification. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptors (RAGEs) reportedly play critical roles in vascular calcification. Herein, we investigated whether targeting AGE-RAGE is a potential treatment for meniscal calcification. In our study, we demonstrated that AGE-RAGE promotes the osteogenesis of meniscal cells and exacerbates meniscal calcification. Mechanistically, AGE-RAGE activates mTOR and simultaneously promotes ATF4 accumulation, thereby facilitating the ATF4-mTOR positive feedback loop that enhances the osteogenic capacity of meniscal cells. In this regard, mTOR inhibits ATF4 degradation by reducing its ubiquitination, while ATF4 activates mTOR by increasing arginine uptake. Our findings substantiate the unique role of AGE-RAGE in the meniscus and reveal the role of the ATF4-mTOR positive feedback loop during the osteogenesis of meniscal cells; these results provide potential therapeutic targets for KOA.",

Various AGEs are produced by different biological pathways in the body. Glyceraldehyde (GA) is an intermediate of glucose and fructose metabolism, and GA-derived AGEs (GA-AGEs), cytotoxic compounds that accumulate and induce damage in mammalian cells, contribute to the onset/progression of LSRDs. The following GA-AGE structures have been detected to date: triosidines, GA-derived pyridinium compounds, GA-derived pyrrolopyridinium lysine dimers, methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1, and argpyrimidine. GA-AGEs are a key contributor to the formation of toxic AGEs (TAGE) in many cells. The extracellular leakage of TAGE affects the surrounding cells via interactions with the receptor for AGEs. Elevated serum levels of TAGE, which trigger different types of cell damage, may be used as a novel biomarker for the prevention and early diagnosis of LSRDs as well as in evaluations of treatment efficacy. This review provides an overview of the structures of GA-AGEs.",

      "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemias are the most common malignancies in childhood. Although its etiology is still unclear, it is thought that disorders in oxidative stress metabolism may contribute to leukemogenesis. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed as a result of the non-enzymatic binding of sugars to biomolecules. Oxidation reactions are triggered through AGE-Receptor (RAGE) interaction, resulting in the formation of reactive oxygen species. These can play crucial roles in cancer pathogenesis and leukemogenesis. It is thought that sRAGE (soluble RAGE) is the end product of glycation and circulates freely in the circulation by binding to RAGE ligands. We investigate novel leukemia biomarkers and focus on soluble RAGE (sRAGE) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosis and prognosis. Thirty children (1-17 years) diagnosed with ALL were included in the study. Patients were divided into standard, medium, and high risk groups according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) treatment protocol. Patients were evaluated twice; at the time of diagnosis and at the sixth month of remission. sRAGE and blood parameters were compared with healthy controls (n = 30, 1-17 years). The sRAGE levels in ALL patients at diagnosis (138.7 ± 177.3 pg/mL) were found to be significantly higher than they were during the sixth month of remission (17.6 ± 21.1 pg/mL) and in healthy controls (22.2 ± 23.7 pg/mL). The cut-off value of the sRAGE level for the diagnosis of ALL was found to be 45 pg/mL in ROC analysis (sensitivity: 73.3%, specificity: 86.7%, AUC: 0.681). At the same time, the sRAGE level was found to be significantly higher in T-ALL patients (490.9 ± 236.9 pg/mL) than in B-ALL patients (84.5 ± 82.7 pg/mL). No significant difference was found in terms of the sRAGE level between standard (45.8± 33.1 pg/mL), medium (212 ± 222.1 pg/mL), and high (143.9 ± 111.5 pg/mL) risk group ALL patients classified according to the BFM protocol. Despite the fact that this was a small, single-center study, our findings highlight the potential use of sRAGE as a biomarker for diagnosing ALL and assessing response to treatment."

      "abstract": "The \"normobaric oxygen paradox\" (NOP) describes the response to the return to normoxia after a hyperoxic event, sensed by tissues as an oxygen shortage, up-regulating redox-sensitive transcription factors. We have previously characterized the time trend of oxygen-sensitive transcription factors in human PBMCs, in which the return to normoxia after 30% oxygen is sensed as a hypoxic trigger, characterized by hypoxia-induced factor (HIF-1) activation. On the contrary, 100% and 140% oxygen induce a shift toward an oxidative stress response, characterized by NRF2 and NF-kB activation in the first 24 h post exposure. Herein, we investigate whether this paradigm triggers Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) and Advanced Oxidation Protein Products (AOPPs) as circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress. Secondly, we studied if mitochondrial biogenesis was involved to link the cellular response to oxidative stress in human PBMCs. Our results show that AGEs and AOPPs increase in a different manner according to oxygen dose. Mitochondrial levels of peroxiredoxin (PRX3) supported the cellular response to oxidative stress and increased at 24 h after mild hyperoxia, MH (30% O2), and high hyperoxia, HH (100% O2), while during very high hyperoxia, VHH (140% O2), the activation was significantly high only at 3 h after oxygen exposure. Mitochondrial biogenesis was activated through nuclear translocation of PGC-1α in all the experimental conditions. However, the consequent release of nuclear Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM) was observed only after MH exposure. Conversely, HH and VHH are associated with a progressive loss of NOP response in the ability to induce TFAM expression despite a nuclear translocation of PGC-1α also occurring in these conditions. This study confirms that pulsed high oxygen treatment elicits specific cellular responses, according to its partial pressure and time of administration, and further emphasizes the importance of targeting the use of oxygen to activate specific effects on the whole organism.",

METHODS: This study, which included 420 university students (F = 80.2 %; M = 19.8 %), is observational and cross-sectional. Dietary AGEs intakes of individuals were taken with a 24-h food consumption record system. Measuring the depression status of the participants was evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the assessment of their sleep quality was evaluated with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Individuals' dAGEs intakes were divided into three equal groups (low, medium, and high). The energy was adjusted in all analyzes of dAGEs intake. Study data were analyzed with the SPSS (27.0 version) and GraphPad program (8.0 version). RESULTS: The BDI and PSQI total score averages of individuals in the high dAGEs intake group were higher than the other groups, and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). There is no significant difference between individuals' dAGEs intakes and energy and macronutrient intakes. Students' dAGEs intake was affected by BDI (β = 0.722, 95 % Cl = 0.639;0.811) and PSQI (β = 0.286, 95 % Cl = 0.179;0.431) scores (p < 0.001). This effect persisted even when various confounding factors were included (age, gender, smoking, body mass index, chronic disease) (p < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: These data are cross-sectional, which limits the generalizability of results and establishing cause-effect relationships. CONCLUSION: There may be an association between dAGEs intake and the development of depression and sleep quality in young adults. Clinical intervention studies using objective measurement methods should be conducted on this issue in the future.",

On the other hand, few reports have been published concerning such effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. We undertook the present study to evaluate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors on the advanced glycation end products (AGEs), well known as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disorders.Type 2 diabetes mellitus were divided into two groups and treated with either SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors for 3 months. Before and after the 3-month treatment period with each drug, the AGEs and diabetes-related parameters were measured. Methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone-1 (MG-H1) was measured as one of the AGEs.In the SGLT2 inhibitor group, both the blood HbA1c and MG-H1 levels decreased significantly after the 3-month treatment period. In the DPP-4 inhibitor group, only the blood HbA1c level decreased significantly, with no significant change of the blood MG-H1 level.SGLT2 inhibitor reduced both the blood levels of HbA1c and AGEs (MG-H1). Considering that the blood levels of AGEs are associated with the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular disorders, the results of the present study suggest that the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in suppressing cardiovascular death might be mediated by the reduction in the blood levels of AGEs induced by this class of drugs. DPP-4 inhibitors showed no significant effects on the blood levels of AGEs.",

AGEs formation can be triggered by several factors such as UVB, glyoxal and methylglyoxal etc. However, little attention has been paid to glyoxal-derived AGEs (GO-AGEs) and UVB-induced skin inflammaging, with none have investigated together. This study aimed to investigate the possible role of GO-AGEs and UVB in skin inflammaging focusing on revealing its molecular mechanisms. The effects of GO-AGEs in the presence or absence of UVB were studied by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, qPCR, flow cytometry and in silico approaches. In HaCaT cells, GO-AGEs in the presence of UVB irradiation (125 mJ/cm2) dramatically enhanced the release of different pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) with further activation of RAGE signaling pathways (NF-κB, COX 2, and IL- 1β) and increased oxidative stress also noticed in NHEK cells. In NHDF cells, extracellular matrix disruption noted via increasing matrix metalloproteinase release and decreasing collagen type 1 and SIRT1 expression. Besides that, the docking scores obtained from the molecular docking study support the above-mentioned results. This study strongly suggests the pivotal role of GO-AGEs in skin inflammaging and illuminates novel molecular pathways for searching most effective and updated anti-aging therapy.",

To investigate the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in fried shrimp and provide pretreatment guidance for producing low-AGEs fried pacific white shrimp were treated with seven pretreatment methods before frying. The AGEs contents, physicochemical indicators, and their correlations in the fried shrimps' interior, surface, and batter layer were analyzed. Results indicated that pretreatment methods influenced both Maillard and oxidation reactions by altering the basic compositions, which controlled the formation of AGEs. The highest and lowest AGEs contents were obtained in shelled shrimp with exscinded back and whole shrimp, respectively. The batter-coated treatment reduced the AGEs contents in samples but increased the oil content. Correlation analysis showed that lipid oxidation was the decisive chemical reaction to the formation of AGEs by promoting the generation of dicarbonyl compounds and their combination with free amino acids. Conclusively, the whole shrimp was suitable for producing fried shrimp with low AGEs, oil content, and desirable color."

Protein-bound CML and CEL in commercially prepared samples were higher than those in raw prefabricated ones due to the impact of heat treatment. Levels of GO and MGO demonstrated negative correlations with fat (R = -0.720 and -0.751, p < 0.05) in commercially prepared samples, whereas positive correlations were observed (R = 0.526 and 0.521, p < 0.05) in raw prefabricated ones. The heat-induced formation of protein-bound CML and CEL showed a negative correlation with the variations of GO and MGO but was positively related to protein levels in prefabricated products, suggesting that GO and MGO may interact with proteins to generate AGEs during heating. The influence of NaCl on the formation of GO and MGO exhibited variations across different fish products, necessitating further investigation."

We previously demonstrated the involvement of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the pathogenesis of SAH related neuronal death. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of a recombinant soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) on microcirculation impairment following SAH. Intrathecal injection of autologous blood in rats, mixed primary astrocyte and microglia cultures exposed to hemolysates and endothelial cells ​(ECs) from human brain microvascular exposed to glia-conditioned medium or SAH patient's CSF were used as experimental SAH models in vivo and in vitro. The results indicated that intrathecal administration of recombinant sRAGE significantly ameliorated the vasoconstriction of cortical arterioles and associated perfusion impairment, brain edema, reduced cell death, endothelial dysfunction, and improved motor performance at 24 and 48 ​h after SAH induction in rats. The in vitro results further showed that recombinant sRAGE significantly reduced astrocyte swelling and microglia activation, in parallel with decreased mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in vitro. Moreover, the in vitro model of SAH-induced p-eNOS and eNOS suppression, along with stress fiber formation in brain microvascular ECs, was effectively reversed by sRAGE treatment and led to a decrease in cleaved-caspase 3 expression. In summary, recombinant sRAGE effectively lessened microcirculation impairment and vascular injury after SAH via the mechanism of anti-inflammation, which may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for SAH.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent changes in dietary habits have resulted in increased intake of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are known to have a predominant contribution to the pathogenesis and complications of coronary artery disease (CAD). AGEs are also thought to induce weight gain by affecting appetite, energy expenditure, and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here, we investigated whether the restriction of dietary AGEs could affect appetite, body composition, anthropometric indices, and BAT-derived markers in CAD patients treated with angioplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two stented CAD patients were randomly allocated into two groups that received either a low-AGEs or a control diet for 12 weeks. At baseline and postintervention, fasting blood samples were analyzed for total AGEs, nesfatin-1, and BAT-derived markers (fibroblast growth factor 21 and neuregulin 4). Subjective appetite ratings and body composition were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and bioelectric impedance analysis. Anthropometric indices, including fat mass index (FMI), abdominal volume index (AVI), and body adiposity index (BAI), were calculated through the relevant formula. RESULTS: Restricting dietary AGEs for 12 weeks could cause a significant reduction in weight, FMI, AVI, and BAI (P < 0.05) compared to the comparison group. In addition, VAS data analyses indicated a significant decrease in the sense of hunger and prospective food intake (P < 0.05) in the intervention group compared to the comparison group. No significant difference was seen in the measured biochemical markers between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the low-AGEs diet could decrease appetite, weight, and anthropometric indices in stented CAD patients."

We herein evaluated the effects of AGE-Apts on muscle mass and strength in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. Eight-month-old male SAMP8 mice received subcutaneous infusion of control DNA aptamers (CTR-Apts) or AGE-Apts. Mice in an age-matched senescence-accelerated mouse resistant strain 1 (SAMR1) group were treated with CTR-Apts as controls. The soleus muscles were collected after the 8-week intervention for weight measurement and histological, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence analyses. Grip strength was measured before and after the 8-week intervention. AGE-Apt treatment inhibited the progressive decrease in the grip strength of SAMP8 mice. SAMP8 mice had lower soleus muscle weight and fiber size than SAMR1 mice, which was partly restored by AGE-Apt treatment. Furthermore, AGE-Apt-treated SAMP8 mice had a lower interstitial fibrosis area of the soleus muscle than CTR-Apt-treated SAMP8 mice. The soleus muscle levels of AGEs, oxidative stress, receptor for AGEs, and muscle ring-finger protein-1 were increased in the CTR-Apt-treated mice, all of which, except for AGEs, were inhibited by AGE-Apt treatment. Our present findings suggest that the subcutaneous delivery of AGE-Apts may be a novel therapeutic strategy for aging-related decrease in skeletal muscle mass and strength."

      "abstract": "Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), formed through glyceraldehyde (GA) as an intermediate in non-enzymatic reactions with intracellular proteins, are cytotoxic and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Despite their significance, the mechanisms underlying the degradation of GA-derived AGEs (GA-AGEs) remain unclear. In the present study, we found that N-terminal checkpoint kinase 1 cleavage products (CHK1-CPs) and their mimic protein, d270WT, were degraded intracellularly post-GA exposure. Notably, a kinase-dead d270WT variant (d270KD) underwent rapid GA-induced degradation, primarily via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The high-molecular-weight complexes formed by the GA stimulation of d270KD were abundant in the RIPA-insoluble fraction, which also contained high levels of GA-AGEs. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the high-molecular-weight complexes of d270KD were modified by GA-AGEs and that p62/SQSTM1 was one of its components. The knockdown of p62 or treatment with chloroquine reduced the amount of high-molecular-weight complexes in the RIPA-insoluble fraction, indicating its involvement in the formation of GA-AGE aggregates. The present results suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and p62 play a role in the degradation and aggregation of intracellular GA-AGEs. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying GA-AGE metabolism and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with the accumulation of GA-AGEs.",

Endogenous AGEs have been associated with various health problems such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Inflammation is thought to be one of the main mechanisms in the development of these disorders. Although AGEs are produced endogenously in the body, exogenous sources such as smoking and diet also contribute to the body pool. Therefore, when the AGE pool in the body rises above physiological levels, different pathological conditions may occur through various mechanisms, especially inflammation. While the effects of endogenous AGEs on the development of inflammation have been studied relatively extensively, and current evidence indicates that dietary AGEs (dAGEs) contribute to the body's AGE pool, it is not yet known whether dAGEs have the same effect on the development of inflammation as endogenous AGEs. Therefore, this review aimed to evaluate the results of cross-sectional and intervention studies to understand whether dAGEs are associated with inflammation and, if there is an effect on inflammation, through which mechanisms this effect might occur.",

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) exhibit kidney-protective actions through poorly understood mechanisms. Here we interrogated whether the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays a role in mediating the actions of GLP-1 on inflammation and diabetic kidney disease. Mice with deletion of the GLP-1 receptor displayed an abnormal kidney phenotype that was accelerated by diabetes and improved with co-deletion of RAGE in vivo. Activation of the GLP-1 receptor pathway with liraglutide, an anti-diabetic treatment, downregulated kidney RAGE, reduced the expansion of bone marrow myeloid progenitors, promoted M2-like macrophage polarization and lessened markers of kidney damage in diabetic mice. Single cell transcriptomics revealed that liraglutide induced distinct transcriptional changes in kidney endothelial, proximal tubular, podocyte and macrophage cells, which were dominated by pathways involved in nutrient transport and utilization, redox sensing and the resolution of inflammation. The kidney-protective action of liraglutide was corroborated in a non-diabetic model of chronic kidney disease, the subtotal nephrectomised rat. Thus, our findings identify a novel glucose-independent kidney-protective action of GLP-1-based therapies in diabetic kidney disease and provide a valuable resource for exploring the cell-specific kidney transcriptional response ensuing from pharmacological GLP-1R agonism.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are compounds formed due to aging and diabetes mellitus (DM). They activate NADPH oxidase (NOX) by binding to their receptors, thereby increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the effects of AGEs on the tissues of the shoulder joint (such as rotator cuff synovium, and capsule) in patients with DM having rotator cuff tears. METHODS: This study included eight patients with DM who underwent surgical treatment for rotator cuff tears with contracture. The rotator cuff, synovium, and joint capsule were harvested at the time of surgery and evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Furthermore, immunostaining was used for evaluating AGEs and receptor for AGEs (RAGE), cell activity, ROS, and apoptosis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the cellular evaluation of NOX, interleukins, RAGE, and collagen. RESULTS: The AGEs and RAGE staining as well as the ratio of ROS and apoptosis were in the following order: rotator cuff > joint capsule > synovium. In contrast, the cellular activity was significantly higher in the synovium than in the other regions. The type I collagen expression (as shown by qPCR) as well as the RAGE and NOX expressions were as follows: rotator cuff > joint capsule > synovium. Conversely, the expression of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6 and IL-1β) was higher in the synovium than in the other regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is among the first to evaluate the effects of AGEs on each tissue of the shoulder joint in patients with DM having rotator cuff tears and contractures. The accumulation of AGEs in each tissue of the shoulder joint could reveal the locations affected by DM, which can lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of DM-related shoulder diseases.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prediabetic subjects, subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and subjects without a diabetes mellitus diagnosis undergoing fixed orthodontic therapy with MBT prescription brackets (0.022-inch brackets and 0.019 × 0.025-inch stainless steel archwires) were included in the study. The following clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated: (1) plaque score (PS), (2) probing depth (PD), (3) bleeding on probing (BOP), and (4) clinical attachment loss. Crevicular fluid and saliva specimens were collected during regular orthodontic visits. Salivary and crevicular fluid tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, ghrelin, resistin, AGEs, and receptor activator of nuclear factor κΒ ligand were evaluated using a human magnetic Luminex multiplex assay. RESULTS: BOP scores were significantly higher among T2DM subjects (19.2%) than among nondiabetic subjects (11.2%) and prediabetic subjects (15.9%). Comparable values were demonstrated by all three study groups regarding PD scores and PSs. T2DM subjects demonstrated higher scores for gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) chemokines than nondiabetic and prediabetic subjects. A statistically significant difference was found in the levels of AGEs and resistin among the three study groups. The scores revealed for the levels of GCF resistin and AGEs versus periodontal BOP demonstrated a significant positive association by the Pearson correlation test. CONCLUSIONS: T2DM patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of GCF resistin and AGEs during fixed orthodontic therapy. Chronic hyperglycemic patients undergoing orthodontic therapy demonstrated a proinflammatory response.",

RAGE activation caused by the ligand binding initiates a cascade of complex pathways associated with producing free radicals, such as reactive nitric oxide and oxygen species, cell proliferation, and immunoinflammatory processes. The involvement of RAGE in the pathogenesis of disorders such as diabetes, inflammation, tumor progression, and endothelial dysfunction is dictated by the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) at pathologic states leading to sustained RAGE upregulation. The involvement of RAGE and its ligands in numerous pathologies and diseases makes RAGE an interesting target for therapy focused on the modulation of both RAGE expression or activation and the production or exogenous administration of AGEs. Despite the known role that the RAGE/AGE axis plays in multiple disease states, there remains an urgent need to develop noninvasive, molecular imaging approaches that can accurately quantify RAGE levels in vivo that will aid in the validation of RAGE and its ligands as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontitis are two prevalent diseases with mutual influence. Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in hyperglycemia may impair cell function and worsen periodontal conditions. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an important post-transcriptional modification in RNAs that regulates cell fate determinant and progression of diseases. However, whether m6A methylation participates in the process of periodontitis with diabetes is unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of AGEs on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), elucidate the m6A modification mechanism in diabetes-associated periodontitis. METHODS: Periodontitis with diabetes were established by high-fat diet/streptozotocin injection and silk ligation. M6A modifications in alveolar bone were demonstrated by RNA immunoprecipitation sequence. BMSCs treated with AGEs, fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) protein knockdown and sclerostin (SOST) interference were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot, immunofluorescence, alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin red S staining. RESULTS: Diabetes damaged alveolar bone regeneration was validated in vivo. In vitro experiments showed AGEs inhibited BMSCs osteogenesis and influenced the FTO expression and m6A level in total RNA. FTO knockdown increased the m6A levels and reversed the AGE-induced inhibition of BMSCs differentiation. Mechanically, FTO regulated m6A modification on SOST transcripts, and AGEs affected the binding of FTO to SOST transcripts. FTO knockdown accelerated the degradation of SOST mRNA in presence of AGEs. Interference with SOST expression in AGE-treated BMSCs partially rescued the osteogenesis by activating Wnt Signaling. CONCLUSIONS: AGEs impaired BMSCs osteogenesis by regulating SOST in an m6A-dependent manner, presenting a promising method for bone regeneration treatment of periodontitis with diabetes.",

The inhibition of myoblast proliferation is one of the causes that trigger muscle atrophy. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) contribute to muscle atrophy. Since primary cilia are crucial organelles for proliferation, AGEs may inhibit primary cilia formation of myoblasts, thereby leading to impaired proliferation. Therefore, we aimed to clarify whether AGEs impeded the proliferation and formation of primary cilia of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. AGE treatment inhibited the proliferation and formation of primary cilia. However, the inhibitor of the receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGEs) abolished the inhibition of the proliferation and the primary cilia formation of C2C12 cells by AGEs, suggesting that AGEs cause these inhibitions through the RAGE pathway. In summary, our findings suggested that AGEs suppress the proliferation and formation of primary cilia of myoblasts through the RAGE pathway.",

METHODS: VSMC were obtained from non-diabetic rats, grown with or without AGE; while VSMC of in vivo-ex vivo studies were obtained from non-diabetic control animals (C), diabetic (D), C treated with metformin (M) and D treated with metformin (D-M). We studied the osteoblastic differentiation by evaluating alkaline phosphatase (ALP), type I collagen (Col) and mineral deposit. RESULTS: In vitro, AGE increased proliferation, migration, and osteoblastic differentiation of VSMC. Metformin cotreatment prevented the AGE induced proliferation and migration. Both AGE and metformin stimulated the expression of ALP and Col. AGE induced mineralization was prevented by metformin. VSMC from D expressed a higher production of Col and ALP. Those from D-M showed an ALP increase vs C and M, and a partial decrease vs D. Cultured in osteogenic medium, ALP, Col and mineralization increased in D vs C, remained unchanged in M, and were prevented in D-M animals. CONCLUSION: Both AGE and DM favor VSMC differentiation towards the osteogenic phenotype and this effect can be prevented by metformin.",

Body weight and physical activity are strongly associated with recurrence risk, thus lifestyle modification is an attractive strategy to improve prognosis. Trials of dietary modification in breast cancer are promising but the role of specific diets is unclear, as is whether high-quality diet without weight loss can impact prognosis. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are compounds produced in the body during sugar metabolism. Exogenous AGEs, such as those found in food, combined with endogenous AGEs, make up the total body AGE load. AGEs deposit in tissues over time impacting cell signaling pathways and altering protein functions. AGEs can be measured or estimated in the diet and measured in blood through their metabolites. Studies demonstrate an association between AGEs and breast cancer risk and prognosis. Here, we review the clinical data on dietary and serum AGEs in breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation is implicated in the development of diabetic complications including vascular pathology. Centrosome is known to play a role in cell secretion. We have reported that diabetes can trigger centrosome amplification (CA). Thus, in the present study, we investigated the relationship between CA and the release of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in hCMEC/D3 human endothelial cells treated with advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We found that AGEs induced CA via PLK4 and increased the biosynthesis of the three cytokines via NF-κB. Importantly, treatment of the cells with AGEs also increased the release of the three cytokines. Inhibiting CA by knockdown of polo like kinase 4 (PLK4) attenuated the cytokine release but not their biosynthesis. Knockdown of the cytokines inhibited the CA, while addition of the cytokines individually to the cell culture increased the protein level of PLK4 and CA to a moderate level. Addition of the three cytokines together into the cell culture markedly enhanced the CA, to a level higher than that in the AGEs-treated group. In conclusion, our results provide the direct evidence that the cytokines can induce CA, and suggest that there is a mutual promoting cycle between CA and cytokine release in the treated samples. It is proposed that the cycle of CA-cytokine release is a candidate biological link between diabetes and its complications such as vascular pathologies.",

      "abstract": "Complications arising from diabetes can threaten multiple organs. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) play a significant role in inducing these complications. Highly processed diets and hyperglycemia facilitate the accumulation of AGEs in the body. Interaction between AGEs and their main receptor (RAGE) initiates the transmission of intracellular inflammatory and cell death signals, which ultimately lead to complications. To counter AGEs-induced damage, we developed an siRNA-binding tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (TDN) system, termed Tsi, which combines the potent cell membrane penetrability and serum stability of TDN with the gene-targeting specificity of siRNA-RAGE. Tsi effectively and persistently downregulates the expression of RAGE, thereby suppressing inflammation by blocking the NF-κB pathway as well as exhibiting antioxidant functions. Furthermore, Tsi regulates the pyroptosis state of macrophages via the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which inhibits the spread of cell death signals and maintains homeostasis. This is of great significance for the synergistic treatment strategy for systemic complications in patients with refractory hyperglycemia. In summary, this study describes a nanomedicine that targets the RAGE and suppresses AGE-induced inflammation. This nucleic acid drug holds long-lasting efficacy and is independent of lowering hyperglycemia, which provides a strategy for the treatment of diabetic complications and age-related diseases.",

AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the actions and mechanisms of SJZD on bone remodeling in a type 2 diabetes mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetic mice generated with a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) were subjected to SJZD treatment for 8 weeks. Blood glucose and lipid profile, redox status and bone metabolism were determined by ELISA or biochemical assays. Bone quality was evaluated by micro-CT, three-point bending assay and Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR). Bone histomorphometry alterations were evaluated by Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and Safranin O-fast green staining. The expressions of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE), phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa-B (p-NF-κB), NF-κB, cathepsin K, semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), p-GSK-3β, (p)-β-catenin, Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Cyclin D1 in the femurs and/or tibias were examined by Western blot or immunohistochemical staining. The main constituents in the SJZD aqueous extract were characterized by a HPLC/MS. RESULTS: SJZD intervention improved glucose and lipid metabolism and preserved bone quality in the diabetic mice, in particular glucose tolerance, lipid profile, bone microarchitecture, strength and material composition. SJZD administration to diabetic mice preserved redox homeostasis in serum and bone marrow, and prevented an increase in AGEs, RAGE, p-NF-κB/NF-κB, cathepsin K, p-GSK-3β, p-β-catenin expressions and a decrease in Sema3A, IGF1, β-catenin, Runx2 and Cyclin D1 expressions in tibias and/or femurs. Thirteen compounds were identified in SJZD aqueous extract, including astilbin, liquiritin apioside, ononin, ginsenoside Re, Rg1, Rb1, Rb2, Ro, Rb3, Rd, notoginsenoside R2, glycyrrhizic acid, and licoricesaponin B2. CONCLUSIONS: SJZD ameliorates bone quality in diabetic mice possibly via maintaining redox homeostasis. The mechanism governing these alterations are possibly related to effects on the AGEs/RAGE and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. SJZD may offer a novel source of drug candidates for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis.",

      "abstract": "Atrophic nonunion (AN) is a complex and poorly understood pathological condition resulting from impaired fracture healing. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several bone disorders, including osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. However, the role of AGEs in the development of AN remains unclear. This study found that mice fed a high-AGE diet had a higher incidence of atrophic nonunion (AN) compared to mice fed a normal diet following tibial fractures. AGEs induced two C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs), CtBP1 and CtBP2, which were necessary for the development of AN in response to AGE accumulation. Feeding a high-AGE diet after fracture surgery in CtBP1/2-/- and RAGE-/- (receptor of AGE) mice did not result in a significant occurrence of AN. Molecular investigation revealed that CtBP1 and CtBP2 formed a heterodimer that was recruited by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) to assemble a complex. The CtBP1/2-HDAC1-Runx2 complex was responsible for the downregulation of two classes of bone development and differentiation genes, including bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These findings demonstrate that AGE accumulation promotes the incidence of AN in a CtBP1/2-dependent manner, possibly by modulating genes related to bone development and fracture healing. These results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of AN and suggest new therapeutic targets for its prevention and treatment.",

Plasma has been suggested to restore microvascular integrity by preservation and repair of the EG. We sought to evaluate whether plasma administered in a 1:1:1 ratio was associated with less endothelial marker circulation than a 1:1:2 ratio. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the PROPPR trial, which investigated post-traumatic resuscitation with platelets, plasma, and red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio compared with a 1:1:2 ratio. Syndecan-1, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were quantified for each treatment group on admission and at 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. Patients were excluded if they did not survive longer than 3 hours or had data from fewer than two time points. RESULTS: Three hundred eight patients in the 1:1:1 group and 291 in the 1:1:2 group were analyzed. There were no statistically significant differences in syndecan-1, sTM, or RAGE between treatment groups at any time point ( p > 0.05). Patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and death had significantly elevated biomarker expression at most time points when compared with patients who did not develop these sequelae ( p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Administration of FFP in a 1:1:1 ratio does not consistently affect circulation of endothelial biomarkers following significant trauma when compared with a 1:1:2 ratio. The development of post-traumatic ARDS, AKI, and death was associated with increased endothelial biomarker circulation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/Care Management; Level III.",

Considering the role of this receptor in the initiation and establishment of neuroinflammation, and the limited understanding of the function of RAGE in the maintenance of this condition, this study describes the effects of RAGE inhibition in the brain, through an intranasal treatment with the antagonist FPS-ZM1, in an animal model of chronic neuroinflammation induced by acute intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Seventy days after LPS administration (2 mg/kg, i.p.), Wistar rats received, intranasally, 1.2 mg of FPS-ZM1 over 14 days. On days 88 and 89, the animals were submitted to the open-field test and were killed on day 90 after the intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Our results indicate that blockade of encephalic RAGE attenuates LPS-induced chronic neuroinflammation in different brain regions. Furthermore, we found that intranasal FPS-ZM1 administration reduced levels of gliosis markers, RAGE ligands, and α-synuclein in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Additionally, the treatment also reversed the increase in S100 calcium-binding protein B (RAGE ligand) in the cerebrospinal fluid and the cognitive-behavioral deficits promoted by LPS-less time spent in the central zone of the open-field arena (more time in the lateral zones), decreased total distance traveled, and increased number of freezing episodes. In summary, our study demonstrates the prominent role of RAGE in the maintenance of a chronic neuroinflammatory state triggered by a single episode of systemic inflammation and also points to possible future RAGE-based therapeutic approaches to treat conditions in which chronic neuroinflammation and increased α-synuclein levels could play a relevant role, such as in Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) accumulation is associated with ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) dysfunction. Vitamin B6 derivatives positively affected reproduction. The current study was conducted to elucidate the AGEs effects on human luteinized mural GCs steroidogenesis in the presence or absence of pyridoxamine (PM). METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated GCs of 50 healthy women were divided into four parts and treated with media alone (Control), PM alone, or human glycated albumin (HGA) with/without PM. Main steroidogenic enzymes and hormones were assessed by qRT-PCR and ELISA. The AGE receptor (RAGE) protein was also determined using Western blotting. The non-toxic concentration of HGA increased the expression of RAGE, StAR, 3β-HSD, and 17β-HSD (P < 0.0001 for all) but decreased the expression of CYP19A1 at mRNA levels. The increased RAGE protein expression was also confirmed by western blot analysis. These effects resulted in declined estradiol (E2), slightly, and a sharp rise in progesterone (P4) and testosterone (T) levels, respectively. PM, on its own, ameliorated the HGA-altered enzyme expression and, thereby, corrected the aberrant levels of E2, P4, and T. These effects are likely mediated by regulating the RAGE gene and protein expression. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that hormonal dysfunctions induced by the AGEs-RAGE axis in luteinized GCs are likely rectified by PM treatment. This effect is likely acquired by reduced expression of RAGE. A better understanding of how AGEs and PM interact in ovarian physiology and pathology may lead to more targeted therapy for treating ovarian dysfunction.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the roles of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in the mechanisms underlying AGE-induced apoptosis of NPCs. TXNIP was silenced or overexpressed in HNPCs exposed to AGEs. Glycolysis was assessed using extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), ATP level, GLUT1, and GLUT4 measurements. AGEs, TXNIP, GLUT1, and GLUT4 levels in IVDD patients were measured as well. In NPCs, AGEs reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis, inhibited glycolysis, and increased TXNIP expression. Silencing TXNIP compromised the effects of AGEs on cell viability, apoptosis, and glycolysis in NPCs. Furthermore, TXNIP overexpression resulted in decreased cell viability, increased apoptotic cells, and glycolysis suppression. Furthermore, co-treatment with a glycolysis inhibitor improved TXNIP silencing's suppressive effects on AGE-induced cell injury in NPCs. In IVDD patients with Pfirrmann Grades II-V, increasing trends in AGEs and TXNIP were observed, while decreasing trends in GLUT1 and GLUT4. AGE levels had positive correlations with TXNIP levels. Both AGE and TXNIP levels correlated negatively with GLUT1 and GLUT4. Our study indicates that TXNIP plays a role in mediating AGE-induced cell injury through suppressing glycolysis. The accumulation of AGEs, the upregulation of TXNIP, and the downregulation of GLUT1 and GLUT4 are all linked to the progression of IVDD.",

      "abstract": "In diabetic patients, diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the most common causes of death. The inflammatory response is essential in the pathogenesis of DCM. Rhein, an anthraquinone compound, is extracted from the herb rhubarb, demonstrating various biological activities. However, it is unclear whether rhein has an anti-inflammatory effect in treating DCM. In our research, we investigated the anti-inflammatory properties as well as its possible mechanism. According to the findings in vitro, rhein could to exert an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the production of NO, TNF-α, PGE2, iNOS, and COX-2 in RAW264.7 cells that had been stimulated with advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). In addition, rhein alleviated H9C2 cells inflammation injury stimulated by AGEs/macrophage conditioned medium (CM). In vivo have depicted that continuous gavage of rhein could improve cardiac function and pathological changes. Moreover, it could inhibit the accumulation of AGEs and infiltration of inflammatory factors inside the heart of rats having DCM. Mechanism study showed rhein could suppress IKKβ and IκB phosphorylation via down-regulating TRAF6 expression to inhibit NF-κB pathway in AGEs/CM-induced H9C2 cells. Moreover, the anti-inflammation effect of rhein was realized through down-regulation phosphorylation of JNK MAPK. Furthermore, we found JNK MAPK could crosstalk with NF-κB pathway by regulating IκB phosphorylation without affecting IKKβ activity. And hence, the protective mechanism of rhein may involve the inhibiting of the TRAF6-NF/κB pathway, the JNK MAPK pathway, and the crosstalk between the two pathways. These results suggested that rhein may be a promising drug candidate in anti-inflammation and inflammation-related DCM therapy.",

Vascular large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels play important roles in coronary arterial function.Purpose: Our study aimed to investigate the regulatory role of AGEs in BK channels.Research Design: Using gavage of vehicle (V, normal saline) or aminoguanidine (A) for 8 weeks, normal and diabetic rats were divided into four groups: C+V group, DM+V group, C+A group, and DM+A group.Study Sample: Coronary arteries from different groups of rats and human coronary smooth muscle cells were used in this study.Data Collection and Analysis: Data were presented as mean ± SEM (standard error of mean). Student's t-test was used to compare data between two groups. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc LSD analysis was used to compare data between multiple groups.Results: Compared to the C+V group, vascular contraction induced by iberiotoxin (IBTX), a BK channel inhibitor, was impaired, and BK channel densities decreased in the DM+V group. However, aminoguanidine administration reduced the impairment. Protein expression of BK-β1, phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and protein kinase B (PKB or Akt) were down-regulated, while F-box protein 32 (FBXO32) expression increased in the DM+V group and in high glucose (HG) cultured human coronary smooth muscle cells. Treatment with aminoguanidine in vitro and in vivo could reverse the above protein expression. The effect of aminoguanidine on the improvement of BK channel function by inhibiting the generation of AGEs was reversed by adding MK2206 (Akt inhibitor) or Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) in HG conditions in vitro.Conclusions: AGEs aggravate BK channel dysfunction via the AMPK/Akt/FBXO32 signaling pathway.",

However, the relationship between the AGEs measured by an AGEs sensor noninvasively at the fingertip and prognosis in patients with CVD remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationship between AGEs score and prognosis among patients with CVD. METHODS: A total of 191 outpatients with CVD were included. AGEs score were measured using an AGEs sensor and the patients were classified into groups by the median value of AGEs score. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 30 months was compared between high- and low-AGEs score groups. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate cutoff value for the AGEs score, which discriminates the occurrence of MACCE. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with the presence of MACCE. MACCE included cardiac death, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, heart failure, and stroke. RESULTS: AGEs score was normally distributed, with a median value of 0.51. No significant intergroup differences were found in laboratory findings, physical functions, or medications. The high-AGEs score group had a significantly higher incidence of MACCE than the low-AGEs score group (27.1 vs. 10.5%, P = 0.007). A high-AGEs score was a risk factor for MACCE (hazard ratio, 2.638; 95% confidence interval, 1.271-5.471; P = 0.009). After the adjustment for confounders other than 6-min walking distance, the AGEs score remained a factor associated with the occurrence of MACCE. The best cutoff AGEs score for the detection of MACCE was 0.51 (area under the curve, 0.642; P = 0.008; sensitivity, 72.2%; specificity, 54.8%). CONCLUSIONS: AGEs score measured at the fingertip in patients with CVD is associated with MACCE. AGEs score, which can be measured noninvasively and easily, may be useful as an assessment for the secondary prevention of CVD in patients with CVD.",

      "abstract": "Glycolytic overload in diabetes causes large accumulation of the highly reactive dicarbonyl compound methylglyoxal (MGO) and overproduction of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which interact with their receptors (RAGE), leading to diabetes-associated macrovascular complications. The bladder is an organ that stays most in contact with dicarbonyl species, but little is known about the importance of the MGO-AGEs-RAGE pathway to diabetes-associated bladder dysfunction. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of the MGO-AGEs-RAGE pathway in bladder dysfunction of diabetic male and female ob/ob mice compared with wild-type (WT) lean mice. Diabetic ob/ob mice were treated with the AGE breaker alagebrium (ALT-711, 1 mg/kg) for 8 wk in drinking water. Compared with WT animals, male and female ob/ob mice showed marked hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, whereas fluid intake remained unaltered. Levels of total AGEs, MGO-derived hydroimidazolone 1, and RAGE in bladder tissues, as well as fluorescent AGEs in serum, were significantly elevated in ob/ob mice of either sex. Collagen content was also markedly elevated in the bladders of ob/ob mice. Void spot assays in filter paper in conscious mice revealed significant increases in total void volume and volume per void in ob/ob mice with no alterations of spot number. Treatment with ALT-711 significantly reduced the levels of MGO, AGEs, RAGE, and collagen content in ob/ob mice. In addition, ALT-711 treatment normalized the volume per void and increased the number of spots in ob/ob mice. Activation of AGEs-RAGE pathways by MGO in the bladder wall may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated bladder dysfunction.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The involvement of methylglyoxal (MGO) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in bladder dysfunction of diabetic ob/ob mice treated with the AGE breaker ALT-711 was investigated here. Diabetic mice exhibited high levels of MGO, AGEs, receptor for AGEs (RAGE), and collagen in serum and/or bladder tissues along with increased volume per void, all of which were reduced by ALT-711. Activation of the MGO-AGEs-RAGE pathway in the bladder wall contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated bladder dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Senescence is a natural phenomenon of growing old. It accelerates under certain conditions like diabetes mellitus resulting in early decline of bodily functions, which can be avoided by many claimed functional foods. The present study aims to investigate the anti-aging ability of Fenugreek seeds (Trigonellafoenum-graecum); a common ingredient of Indo-Pak cuisines. Briefly, the Fenugreek seeds extract (FgSE) in concentrationsof0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml inhibited the formation of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) and fructosamine adducts in Bovine serum albumin (BSA)/fructose model in vitro. The BSA conformational analysis via Circular Dichorism and Congo red assays showed that it preserves secondary structure of BSA in aforementioned model. Although mechanistic studies revealed insignificant lysine blocking ability of Fenugreek by OPA assay, however carbonyl entrapping was found to be 24%, 34% and 42% at 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml, respectively. In vivo model of High Fructose diet (HFD) induced glycation, FgSE treatment in doses of 10, 25 & 50 mg/kg markedly improved Escape latency (p < 0.01) and preserved cognition in Morris Water Maze. Our data further exhibits significant decrease of CML (Nε-carboxymethyl lysine) levels in serum and hippocampus byFgSE treatment in comparison with HFD group. Therefore, we deduced that FgSE prevents glycation-induced memory decline via entrapping the reactive carbonyl intermediates, formed during production of AGEs. Hence, as a promising functional food it slows down the harmful process of glycation and aging associated morbidities."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The main characteristics of diabetic nephropathy (DN) at the early stage are abnormal angiogenesis of glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) and macrophage infiltration. Galectin-3 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of DN via binding with its ligand, advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Catalpol, an iridoid glucoside extracted from Rehmannia glutinosa, has been found to ameliorate vascular inflammation, reduce endothelial permeability, and protect against endothelial damage in diabetic milieu. However, little is known about whether catalpol could exert an anti-angiogenesis and anti-inflammation effect induced by AGEs. METHODS: Mouse GECs (mGECs) and RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with different concentrations of AGEs (0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 µg/mL) for different time (0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h) to determine the optimal concentration of AGEs and treatment time. Cells were treated with catalpol (10 µmol/L), GB1107 (1 µmol/L, galectin-3 inhibitor), PX-478 (50 µmol/L, HIF-1α inhibitor), adenovirus-green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) [3×107 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/mL] or Ad-galectin-3-GFP (2×108 PFU/mL), which was followed by incubation with 50 µg/mL AGEs. The levels of galectin-3, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and pro-angiogenic factors angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), tunica interna endothelial cell kinase-2 (Tie-2) were detected by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to evaluate the proliferation of these cells. The expression levels of galectin-3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in mGECs and those of galectin-3 and HIF-1α in RAW 264.7 macrophages were detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. The rat DN model was established. Catalpol (100 mg/kg) or GB1107 (10 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically once a day for 12 weeks. Ad-galectin-3-GFP (6×107 PFU/mL, 0.5 mL) or Ad-GFP (6×106 PFU/mL, 0.5 mL) was injected into the tail vein of rats 48 h before the sacrifice of the animals. The expression of galectin-3, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and HIF-1α in renal cortices was analyzed by Western blotting. The expression of galectin-3, F4/80 (a macrophage biomarker), and CD34 (an endothelium biomarker) in renal cortices was detected by IF staining, and collagen accumulation by Masson staining. RESULTS: The expression levels of galectin-3 and VEGFA were significantly higher in mGECs and RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with 50 µg/mL AGEs for 48 h than those in untreated cells. Catalpol and GB1107 could block the AGEs-induced proliferation of mGECs and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Over-expression of galectin-3 was found to reduce the inhibitory effect of catalpol on the proliferation of cells. Catalpol could significantly decrease the levels of Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 released by AGEs-treated mGECs, which could be reversed by over-expression of galectin-3. Catalpol could significantly inhibit AGEs-induced expression of galectin-3, HIF-1α, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 in mGECs. The inhibitory effect of catalpol on galectin-3 in AGEs-treated mGECs was impaired by PX-478. Moreover, catalpol attenuated the AGEs-activated HIF-1α/galectin-3 pathway in RAW 264.7 macrophages, which was weakened by PX-478. Additionally, catalpol significantly inhibited the expression of galectin-3, macrophage infiltration, collagen accumulation, and angiogenesis in the kidney of diabetic rats. Over-expression of galectin-3 could antagonize these inhibitory effects of catalpol. CONCLUSION: Catalpol prevented the angiogenesis of mGECs and macrophage proliferation via inhibiting galectin-3. It could prevent the progression of diabetes-induced renal damage.",

      "abstract": "Patients with rheumatic diseases suffer depression at a far greater rate than the general population. Aside from evident mental health degradation, in this group of patients depression can often lead to failures in the treatment of the basic disease. The aim of the study was to assess the concentration of advanced glycation end-products (AGE) in the skin autofluorescence (SAF) exam in patients with select rheumatic diseases depending on depression concomitance. 139 patients with rheumatic diseases were enrolled into the study-43 (39F/4 M) patients with RA, 31 (24F/7 M) patients with PsA, 27 (22F/5 M) patients with SLE and 38 (33F/5 M) patients with SSc. In all patients, the concentration of AGE was assessed using the AGE Reader device (DiagnOptics BV Groningen, The Netherlands). The Beck Depression Inventory II was used to assess depression in the patients. Patients who scored 14 points or more in the BDI-II were diagnosed with depression. In the studied group, depression was identified in 73 (53%) patients-25 with RA, 21 with PsA, 11 with SLE and 16 with SSc. Mean SAF in patients with depression was 2.8 ± 0.4, and in the group with no depression-2.2 ± 0.5 (p < 0.001). The study results indicate that in the course of rheumatic diseases, the presence of depression may influence the increase in AGE concentration in the skin. Therefore, evaluating AGE levels in the skin may be clinically relevant as it can help identify patients who may be at risk of developing depression.",

      "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR) is commonly observed during aging and is at the root of many of the chronic nontransmissible diseases experienced as people grow older. Many factors may play a role in causing IR, but diet is undoubtedly an important one. Whether it is total caloric intake or specific components of the diet, the factors responsible remain to be confirmed. Of the many dietary influences that may play a role in aging-related decreased insulin sensitivity, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) appear particularly important. Herein, we have reviewed in detail in vitro, animal, and human evidence linking dietary AGEs contributing to the bodily burden of AGEs with the development of IR. We conclude that numerous small clinical trials assessing the effect of dietary AGE intake in combination with strong evidence in many animal studies strongly suggest that reducing dietary AGE intake is associated with improved IR in a variety of disease conditions. Reducing AGE content of common foods by simple changes in culinary techniques is a feasible, safe, and easily applicable intervention in both health and disease. Large-scale clinical trials are still needed to provide broader evidence for the deleterious role of dietary AGEs in chronic disease.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) are the leading causes of death in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Until now, no prospective biomarker to predict new onset of SSc-ILD or SSc-PAH in patients with SSc has reached clinical application. In homeostasis, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is expressed in lung tissue and involved in cell-matrix adhesion, proliferation and migration of alveolar epithelial cells, and remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature. Several studies have shown that sRAGE levels in serum and pulmonary tissue vary according to the type of lung-related complication. Therefore, we investigated levels of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and its ligand high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in SSc and their abilities to predict SSc-related pulmonary complications. METHODS: One hundred eighty-eight SSc patients were followed retrospectively for the development of ILD, PAH, and mortality for 8 years. Levels of sRAGE and HMGB1 were measured in serum by ELISA. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were performed to predict lung events and mortality and event rates were compared with a log-rank test. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the association between sRAGE and important clinical determinants. RESULTS: At baseline, levels of sRAGE were significantly higher in SSc-PAH-patients (median 4099.0 pg/ml [936.3-6365.3], p = 0.011) and lower in SSc-ILD-patients (735.0 pg/ml [IQR 525.5-1988.5], p = 0.001) compared to SSc patients without pulmonary involvement (1444.5 pg/ml [966.8-2276.0]). Levels of HMGB1 were not different between groups. After adjusting for age, gender, ILD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anti-centromere antibodies, the presence of puffy fingers or sclerodactyly, use of immunosuppression, antifibrotic therapy, or glucocorticoids, and use of vasodilators, higher sRAGE levels remained independently associated with PAH. After a median follow-up of 50 months (25-81) of patients without pulmonary involvement, baseline sRAGE levels in the highest quartile were predictive of development of PAH (log-rank p = 0.01) and of PAH-related mortality (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High systemic sRAGE at baseline might be used as a prospective biomarker for patients with SSc at high risk to develop new onset of PAH. Moreover, high sRAGE levels could predict lower survival rates due to PAH in patients with SSc.",

There are documented age-related changes in the ovarian cancer microenvironment that have been shown to create a permissive metastatic niche, including the formation of advanced glycation end products, or AGEs, that form crosslinks between collagen molecules. Small molecules that disrupt AGEs, known as AGE breakers, have been examined in other diseases, but their efficacy in ovarian cancer has not been evaluated. The goal of this pilot study is to target age-related changes in the tumor microenvironment with the long-term aim of improving response to therapy in older patients. Here, we show that AGE breakers have the potential to change the omental collagen structure and modulate the peritoneal immune landscape, suggesting a potential use for AGE breakers in the treatment of ovarian cancer.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is one of the damage-associated molecular patterns produced by stress and induces inflammatory responses mediated by receptors of advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) on the cell surface. Meanwhile, soluble RAGE (sRAGE) exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect by capturing HMGB1. Animal models have shown upregulation of HMGB1 and RAGE in the brain or blood, suggesting the involvement of these proteins in depression pathophysiology. However, there have been no reports using blood from depressed patients, nor ones focusing on HMGB1 and sRAGE changes associated with treatment and their relationship to depressive symptoms. METHODS: Serum HMGB1 and sRAGE concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a group of patients with severe major depressive disorder (MDD) (11 males and 14 females) who required treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and also in a group of 25 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. HMGB1 and sRAGE concentrations were also measured before and after a course of ECT. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in HMGB1 and sRAGE concentrations in the MDD group compared to healthy subjects. Although ECT significantly improved depressive symptoms, there was no significant change in HMGB1 and sRAGE concentrations before and after treatment. There was also no significant correlation between HMGB1 and sRAGE concentrations and the HAMD total score or subitem scores. CONCLUSION: There were no changes in HMGB1 and sRAGE in the peripheral blood of severely depressed patients, and concentrations had no relationship with symptoms or ECT.",

Blocking RAGE signaling with soluble RAGE (sRAGE) is a therapeutic candidate for renal fibrosis. Methods: NRK-52E cells were stimulated with or without HMGB1 and incubated with sRAGE in vitro. Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally treated with sRAGE after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) operation in vivo. Results: HMBG1-stimulated NRK-52E cells showed increased fibronectin expression, type I collagen, α-smooth muscle actin, and connective tissue growth factor, which were attenuated by sRAGE. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were enhanced in NRK-52E cells exposed to HMBG1, and sRAGE treatment alleviated the activation of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. In the UUO rat models, sRAGE significantly ameliorated the increased renal fibronectin, type I collagen, and α-smooth muscle actin expressions. Masson's trichrome staining confirmed the anti-fibrotic effect of sRAGE in the UUO rat model. RAGE also significantly attenuated the activation of the MAPK pathway and NF-κB, as well as the increased number of infiltrated macrophages within the tubulointerstitium in the kidney of the UUO rat models. Conclusion: These findings suggest that RAGE plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis and that its inhibition by sRAGE may be a potential therapeutic approach for renal fibrosis."

Calpain 6 (CAPN6) is a non-classical calpain that has been reported to be overexpressed in CKD. This study aimed to explore the effects of AGEs in CKD progress and their correlation with CAPN6. AGEs production was measured using ELISA. The CCK-8 assay was used to test cell proliferation. mRNA and protein levels were tested using qRT-PCR and western blot. The progress of glycolysis was tested by calculating the ATP and ECAR content in HK-2 cells. The expression of AGEs and CAPN6 was significantly increased in patients with CKD3, CKD4, and CKD5. AGEs treatment inhibited cell proliferation and glycolysis and accelerated apoptosis. Additionally, CAPN6 knockdown effectively reversed the effects of AGEs in HK-2 cells. In addition, overexpressed CAPN6 played similar role to AGEs, which suppressed cell proliferation and glycolysis and facilitated apoptosis. Moreover, the administration of 2-DG, a glycolysis inhibitor, counteracted the effects of CAPN6 silencing in HK-2 cells. Mechanistically, CAPN6 interacts with NF-κB and PDTC reduced CAPN6 expression in HK-2 cells. This investigation revealed that AGEs facilitate CKD development in vitro by modulating the expression of CAPN6.",

The effects of AGEs on renal function in the elderly remain to be clarified. This study aimed to explore the role of AGEs in renal function decline in the elderly and the protective effect of resveratrol, a stilbenoid polyphenol, comparing it with aminoguanidine (an AGEs inhibitor). A D-galactose-induced aging mouse model was used to explore the role of AGEs in the process of renal aging. The mice were administered D-galactose subcutaneously for eight weeks in the presence or absence of orally administered aminoguanidine or resveratrol. The results showed that the serum levels of AGEs and renal function markers BUN, creatinine, and cystatin C in the mice significantly increased after the administration of D-galactose, and this outcome could be significantly reversed by treatment with aminoguanidine or resveratrol. The protein expression levels for apoptosis, fibrosis, and aging-related indicators in the kidneys were significantly increased, which could also be reversed by treatment with aminoguanidine or resveratrol. These findings suggest that resveratrol could alleviate AGEs-related renal dysfunction through the improvement of renal cellular senescence, apoptosis, and fibrosis in D-galactose-induced aging in mice."

The accumulation of AGEs can trigger numerous negative effects such as oxidative stress, carbonyl stress, inflammation, autophagy dysfunction and imbalance of gut microbiota. Recently, studies have shown that cereal polyphenols have the ability to inhibit the formation of AGEs, thereby preventing and alleviating T2D. In the meanwhile, phenolics compounds could produce different biological effects due to the quantitative structure activity-relationship. This review highlights the effects of cereal polyphenols as a nonpharmacologic intervention in anti-AGEs and alleviating T2D based on the effects of oxidative stress, carbonyl stress, inflammation, autophagy, and gut microbiota, which also provides a new perspective on the etiology and treatment of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Postoperative delirium (POD), which occurs in hospital up to 1-week post-procedure or until discharge, is a common complication, especially in older adult patients. However, the pathogenesis of POD remains unclear. Although damage to blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is involved in the neuropathogenesis of POD, the specific role of the BBB in POD requires further elucidation. Anaesthesia using 2% isoflurane for 4 h results in the upregulation of hippocampal receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) expression and β-amyloid accumulation in aged rats. The present study investigated the role of RAGE in BBB integrity and its mechanisms in POD-like behaviours. The buried food, open field and Y maze tests were used to evaluate neurobehavioural changes in aged mice following 2.5% sevoflurane anaesthesia administration with exploratory laparotomy. Levels of tight junction proteins were assessed by western blotting. Multiphoton in vivo microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructural changes in the BBB in the hippocampal CA1 region. Anaesthesia with surgery decreased the levels of tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 5, increased matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9, damaged the ultrastructure of the BBB and induced POD-like behaviour. FPS-ZM1, a specific RAGE antagonist, ameliorated POD-like behaviour induced by anaesthesia and surgery in aged mice. Furthermore, FPS-ZM1 also restored decreased levels of occludin and claudin 5 as well as increased levels of MMP2 and MMP9. The present findings suggested that RAGE signalling was involved in BBB damage following anaesthesia with surgery. Thus, RAGE has potential as a novel therapeutic intervention for the prevention of POD."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study is aimed at evaluating the relationship between dietary and serum advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) with serum inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers in breast cancer (BC). METHODS: A sample of BC patients was followed for 12 months (March 2020-January 2022). Three-day food consumption record and serum samples were taken before surgery (T1), before chemotherapy (T2), at the 6th month of chemotherapy (T3), and at the 12th month of chemotherapy (T4). Dietary AGE intake was represented by carboxymethyl lysine (dCML). Serum levels of CML, inflammation, and oxidation biomarkers were determined with biochemical blood tests. The results were compared according to human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status. RESULTS: Thirty-two women with BC and 32 age and body mass index-matched healthy women participated. No significant correlation was found between dCML and serum CML, inflammatory or oxidative stress biomarkers at T1, T2, and T4. A weak positive correlation was demonstrated between dCML and serum malondialdehyde levels (rho=0.355, p=0.046) at T3. The serum CML, inflammation, and oxidation biomarker levels of the HER2- group were significantly higher than those of the HER2+ group at T1. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there is limited correlation between dCML and serum inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers in BC patients. Inflammation and oxidative biomarker levels appear to decline with treatment although dietary and serum AGE levels show not a corresponding significant decline. The HER2- subtype appears to be associated with higher dietary and serum AGEs and higher inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers.",

      "abstract": "Background Although diabetes attenuates abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), the mechanisms by which diabetes suppresses AAAs remain incompletely understood. Accumulation of advanced glycation end- (AGEs) reduces extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation in diabetes. Because ECM degradation is critical for AAA pathogenesis, we investigated whether AGEs mediate experimental AAA suppression in diabetes by blocking AGE formation or disrupting AGE-ECM cross-linking using small molecule inhibitors. Methods and Results Male C57BL/6J mice were treated with streptozotocin and intra-aortic elastase infusion to induce diabetes and experimental AAAs, respectively. Aminoguanidine (AGE formation inhibitor, 200 mg/kg), alagebrium (AGE-ECM cross-linking disrupter, 20 mg/kg), or vehicle was administered daily to mice from the last day following streptozotocin injection. AAAs were assessed via serial aortic diameter measurements, histopathology, and in vitro medial elastolysis assays. Treatment with aminoguanidine, not alagebrium, diminished AGEs in diabetic AAAs. Treatment with both inhibitors enhanced aortic enlargement in diabetic mice as compared with vehicle treatment. Neither enhanced AAA enlargement in nondiabetic mice. AAA enhancement in diabetic mice by aminoguanidine or alagebrium treatment promoted elastin degradation, smooth muscle cell depletion, mural macrophage accumulation, and neoangiogenesis without affecting matrix metalloproteinases, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, or serum glucose concentration. Additionally, treatment with both inhibitors reversed suppression of diabetic aortic medial elastolysis by porcine pancreatic elastase in vitro. Conclusions Inhibiting AGE formation or AGE-ECM cross-linking enhances experimental AAAs in diabetes. These findings support the hypothesis that AGEs attenuate experimental AAAs in diabetes. These findings underscore the potential translational value of enhanced ECM cross-linking as an inhibitory strategy for early AAA disease.",

A hyperthyroid and hypothyroid state is associated with oxidative stress. This study aimed to evaluate skin AGE deposition, serum carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), and serum soluble receptor for AGEs (sRAGE) levels in hypothyroid and hyperthyroid patients. METHODS: A total of 203 subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. After excluding diabetes mellitus, 103 newly diagnosed hypothyroid patients, 50 newly diagnosed hyperthyroid patients, and 50 control (euthyroid) subjects were enrolled. All tests were done before beginning the appropriate treatment. Accumulated AGEs in the skin collagen were measured by skin autofluorescence (SAF) using an AGE Reader. RESULTS: SAF measurements were 1.82 ± 0.04, 1.80 ± 0.40, and 1.63 ± 0.30 arbitrary units for the hypothyroid, hyperthyroid, and euthyroid groups, respectively (p = 0.04). Serum CML levels were 8.2 ± 2.8, 10.2 ± 2.0, and 8.0 ± 3.3 ng/mL for the hypothyroid, hyperthyroid, and euthyroid groups, respectively (p = 0.01). sRAGE levels were similar between the groups. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and SAF measurements were positively correlated (r = 0.25, p = 0.02) in the hypothyroid group and negatively correlated in the hyperthyroid group (r = -0.36, p = 0.04). There was no correlation between CML and sRAGE levels. CONCLUSION: SAF measurements are increased in both hypo- and hyperthyroid normoglycemic patients. Serum CML levels are increased in hyperthyroid patients. Hypo and hyperthyroid states might be associated with acceleration of AGE accumulation and may have a long term effect on metabolic memory."
