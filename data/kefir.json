      "abstract": "Co-fermenting kefir with Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to enhance the exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by lactic acid bacteria during fermentation, which may further promote intestinal development in the calf. Four different concentrations (0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%) on a weight/weight basis (g/20 g kefir grain) of either dried, activated distiller's yeast or autolyzed yeast powder were evaluated for EPS optimization in kefir, and inclusion of 1% autolyzed yeast powder resulted in the greatest EPS yield. In a randomized, complete block design, 81 Holstein heifers were enrolled at 3 d of age, blocked by birth weight, and randomized within block to receive either 125 mL salable whole milk (CON), 125 mL of kefir (KEF), or 125 mL of kefir fermented with 1% autolyzed yeast powder (YAK) in milk replacer 1x/d until 28 d of age. Feed intake and health scores were recorded daily for each calf through 1-week postweaning (63 d of age). Growth measurements were recorded weekly until 9 wk. Indigestible markers D-mannitol and Cr-EDTA were administered at 15, 29, and 50 d to a subset of calves (n = 36) and recovered in plasma and serum to measure intestinal permeability. Rumen fluid was collected from calves (n = 35) via gastric tube at 63 ± 2 d to measure pH and VFA concentrations, as well as serum BHB at 14, 28, 42, 56, and 63 d. While health outcomes (diarrhea, respiratory illness, dehydration) were not affected by treatment, supplementation with YAK significantly improved starter DMI and BW in the preweaning period compared with CON and KEF, and postweaning DMI was significantly improved in both KEF and YAK compared with CON. Increased butyrate was observed in rumen fluid of calves fed YAK, though serum BHB was not affected. This work contributes to further understanding kefir as a promoter of gastrointestinal development in calves and the potential benefits of EPS in the developing ruminant."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Dental caries and periodontal diseases are the most common illnesses in the oral cavity and represent a public health concern globally. In recent decades, diverse studies showed that Kefir, a traditional beverage that can be milk- or water-based, contains a complex microbial community and has health benefits. The goal of this review was to update the current knowledge of kefir consumption and its impact on oral health. Methods: The search of a combination of keywords-kefir; dental caries; probiotics; microbiota; periodontal diseases; biofilm; and oral health-was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases for studies in human subjects. Discussion: The research suggests that kefir consumption may aid in decreasing counts of microorganisms typically associated with oral illness. Conclusions: Kefir has the potential to inhibit certain oral pathogens and reduce biofilm formation by promoting diversity within the oral microbiota, suggesting that kefir could be a promising adjuvant treatment for dental caries and periodontal diseases by improving oral health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the impact of the daily consumption of kefir on the gut microbiome, body composition, and athletic performance of professional female soccer players. METHODS: The participants encompassed 21 females aged 18-29 years who were assigned to one of the two groups: the experimental group, which comprised females who consumed 200 mL of kefir daily for 28 days, and the control group, which comprised females who continued with their normal diet. Anthropometric measurements, dietary intake, the composition of the gut microbiome through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and an athletic performance test known as the 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test were performed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that the consumption of kefir increased the microbial diversity (Shannon and Chao1 indices), wherein a significant increase was noted in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, microorganisms that regulate energy metabolism and have anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, the athletic performance variables, including VO2max (mL.kg-1.min-1) and finishing speed (km/h), were strongly related to the abundance of these short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. A link between the microbiota profile and the dietary intake of fiber and protein as well as the body composition measurements was also established. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that kefir consumption can positively affect the gut microbiota, which could in turn affect the athletes' performance. Therefore, to determine the effects of kefir as a functional food in sports nutrition over a longer period, more research should be conducted.",

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of kefir fortified with two strains, Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum, on depression, appetite, oxidative stress, and inflammatory parameters in overweight and obese elderly individuals. METHODS: This study was a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted on 67 elderly men aged over 65, who were randomly divided into two groups. One group (n = 35) received one bottle (240 cc) of regular kefir as a placebo, while the intervention group (n = 32) received one bottle of probiotic-fortified kefir for eight weeks. Depression and appetite were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) and a validated Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), respectively. Oxidative stress parameters were assessed using the standard calorimetric method, and inflammatory parameters were measured via the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (ELISA). The differences between the two groups were compared using the independent samples T-test. RESULTS: The median age of participant in both groups was 65 years. A significant difference in depression scores and the mean change between the two groups was observed after eight weeks (p = 0.001 and p = 0.042, respectively). Within-group comparison revealed a significant increase in appetite scores in both groups (p < 0.05 for both). Moreover, a significant difference in the changes in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was noted (p = 0.009). However, no significant differences were observed in other oxidative and inflammatory parameters between the two groups (p˃0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the positive impact of two specific strains of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus on improving depression in the elderly. However, when comparing the two groups, no significant effects were observed on appetite, inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters, except for TAC.",

      "abstract": "Traditional grain kefir is produced from the fermentation of milk with yeast- and bacteria-containing cultures. To maintain consistency and adhere to food safety guidelines, commercial kefir products are based on starter bacterial cultures. Bacterial profiles of starter vs. grain kefirs differ, and their influence on health effects is unknown. Our objectives were to determine the in vitro fermentation characteristics of common dietary fibers using fecal inoculum from dogs supplemented with kefir or kefir bacterial culture as inoculum. Healthy adult dogs were allotted to one of 3 treatments and supplemented for 14 d (n = 4/treatment): 1) 2% reduced-fat milk treated with lactase (CNTL), 2) starter kefir (S-Kefir), or 3) grain kefir (G-Kefir). After 14 d, fresh fecal samples were collected and frozen in a 20% glycerol solution. For the in vitro experiment, fecal samples were thawed, diluted in an anaerobic diluting solution, and used to inoculate tubes containing semi-defined medium and either cellulose (CEL), pectin (PC), beet pulp (BP), or chicory pulp (CP). Tubes were incubated for 0, 6, 12, or 18 h, with short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), pH, and microbiota measured at each time point. A second in vitro experiment was conducted using similar methods and measurements but with S-Kefir and G-Kefir as inoculum sources. Effects of treatment (inoculum), time, and treatment*time interactions within the fiber source were analyzed statistically using Mixed Models and repeated measures, with P < 0.05 being significant. Using fecal inoculum, BP and PC were rapidly fermented, leading to large pH reductions, SCFA increases, and microbiota shifts. pH change was of greater (P < 0.05) magnitude (PC) and higher (P < 0.05) kinetic rate (CP) when using feces from dogs fed S-Kefir or G-Kefir than controls. Butyrate increases were greater (P < 0.05) in tubes inoculated with G-Kefir feces than in S-Kefir or control feces. When PC and BP were fermented, tubes with S-Kefir feces had greater (P < 0.05) acetate, propionate, and total SCFA increases than G-Kefir or control feces. Fermentations were slower when using kefir cultures as inoculum, but some differences were noted. Bacterial beta diversity and relative abundances shifted over time within each substrate and were unique to the inoculum source. Our data suggest that the activity of kefir bacterial populations differs and that kefir consumption changes the abundance and activity of the fecal microbiota of dogs, justifying in vivo investigation.",

      "abstract": "To clarify the effects of kefir in critical periods of development in adult diseases, we study the effects of kefir intake during early life on gut microbiota and prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis in adulthood. Lactating Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control (C), kefir lactation (KL), and kefir puberty (KP) groups. The C and KP groups received 1 mL of water/day; KL dams received kefir milk daily (108 CFU/mL) during lactation. After weaning (postnatal day 21), KP pups received kefir treatment until 60 days. At 67 days old, colorectal carcinogenesis was induced through intraperitoneal injection of 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine. The gut microbiota composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and DESeq2 (differential abundance method), revealing significant differences in bacterial abundances between the kefir consumption periods. Maternal kefir intake strong anticancer power, suppressed tumors in adult offspring and reduced the relative risk of offspring tumor development. The gut microbiota in cecal samples of the KL group was enriched with Lactobacillus, Romboutsia, and Blautia. In contrast, control animals were enriched with Acinetobacter. The administration of kefir during critical periods of development, with emphasis on lactation, affected the gut microbial community structure to promote host benefits. Pearson analysis indicated positive correlation between tumor number with IL-1 levels. Therefore, the probiotic fermented food intake in early life may be effective as chemopreventive potential against colon tumor development, especially in lactation period.",

Kefir drink is a fermented beverage and has indicated some beneficial health effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of kefir drink on liver aminotransferases, anthropometric indices, glycemic index, lipid profile, blood pressure (BP), high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and malondialdehyde in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: In an 8-week randomized clinical trial, 80 patients with NAFLD were randomized into two groups of 40. After a 2-week run-in period, the groups received a dietary plan and dietary plan plus a cup of kefir drink twice a day (500 cc/d), respectively. Also, demographic, anthropometric, laboratory, BP, dietary intake, and physical activity assessments were analyzed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: At last, seventy-two participants completed the study. No significant difference in changes in BP, anthropometric indices, and laboratory data (P > 0.05) except HDL-C (P = 0.02) and fat-free mass (P < 0.001) was observed between the two study groups. CONCLUSION: Based on the results, Drinking 500 cc/d kefir beverage had no significant effect on liver aminotransferases and metabolic indicators, except for HDL-C and fat-free mass in patients with NAFLD.

      "abstract": "This study investigates the biosorption capabilities of kefir grains, a polysaccharide-based byproduct of the fermentation process, for removing copper(II) and arsenic(V) from contaminated water. Unlike traditional heavy-metal removal methods, which are typically expensive and involve environmentally harmful chemicals, biopolymeric materials such as kefir grains provide a sustainable and cost-effective alternative for adsorbing hazardous inorganic pollutants from aqueous solutions. Our experimental results revealed significant differences in the sorption capacities of two types of kefir grains. Grains of milk kefir outperformed water kefir, particularly in copper(II) removal, achieving up to 95% efficiency at low copper concentrations (0.16 mmol·L-1) and demonstrating a maximum sorption capacity of 49 µmol·g-1. In contrast, water kefir grains achieved only 35.5% maximum removal efficiency and exhibited lower sorption capacity. For arsenic(V) removal, milk kefir grains also showed superior performance, removing up to 56% of arsenic in diluted solution with experimental sorption capacities reaching up to 20 µmol·g-1, whereas water kefir grains achieved a maximum removal efficiency of 34.5%. However, these findings also suggest that while kefir grains show potential as low-cost biosorbents, further modifications are needed to enhance their competitiveness for large-scale water treatment applications."

A common predisposing factor for candidiasis is immune system suppression in specific diseases such as AIDS and various cancers. This study aimed to analyze the effect of Kefir probiotic products on the count of C. Albicans in the saliva of chemotherapy patients. METHODS: In this single-blinded clinical trial, 50 patients were selected who have signed informed consent forms. Patients aged 20-60 years with colon or breast cancer who received the same chemotherapy regimen were included and those with a history of radiation therapy, underlying diseases, using antibiotics, anti-fungal and GCSF medicines were excluded. Matched patients in test and control groups received 100 ccs Kefir probiotic and mineral water, respectively at a specific daily time for five weeks. Blood and saliva samples were collected in five steps. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 21 and the significance level was set at p< 0.05. RESULTS: In saliva samples, the count of C. Albicans in the test group dropped significantly (p<0.05), while there were no significant differences between test and control groups in blood samples (p>0.05). Comparing the follow-up sessions, in the test groups, WBC and Neutrophil, and in the control groups, WBC count and hematocrit showed significant differences (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on the results, using probiotic products daily over a short-term period drops the count of oral C. Albicans. Therefore, Kefir probiotic products can be used as an additional treatment for chemotherapy patients."

Milk kefir, a fermented dairy product produced by a symbiotic community of microorganisms, generates milk kefir grains as a by-product, consisting of the polysaccharide kefiran and proteins. This study develops two materials, one from whole milk kefir grains and another from purified kefiran. Film-forming dispersions were subjected to ultrasonic homogenisation and thermal treatment, yielding homogeneous dispersions. Kefiran dispersion exhibited lower pseudoplastic behaviour and higher viscous consistency, with minimal effects from glycerol. Both films exhibited continuous and homogeneous microstructures, with kefiran films being transparent and milk kefir films displaying a yellowish tint. Analysis revealed that milk kefir films comprised approximately 30% proteins and 70% kefiran. Kefiran films demonstrated stronger interpolymeric interactions, as evidenced using thermogravimetric and mechanical tests. Glycerol increased hydration while decreasing thermal stability, glass transition temperature, elastic modulus, and tensile strength in both films. However, in kefiran films, elongation at the break and water vapour permeability decreased at low glycerol content, followed by an increase at higher plasticiser contents. This suggests an unusual interaction between glycerol and kefiran in the absence of proteins. These findings underscore differences between materials derived from the whole by-product and purified kefiran, offering insights into their potential applications."

Water kefir and kefiran could be alternatives to milk kefir for their application in persons with lactose intolerance or milk allergy and could be incorporated into vegan diets. Using mice models, this work demonstrated that the oral administration of water kefir or kefiran can modulate the respiratory Toll-like receptor (TLR3)-mediated innate antiviral immunity and improve the resistance to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The treatment of mice with water kefir or kefiran for 6 days improved the production of interferons (IFN-β and IFN-γ) and antiviral factors (Mx2, OAS1, RNAseL, and IFITM3) in the respiratory tract after the activation of the TLR3 signaling pathway, differentially modulated the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, reduced RSV replication, and diminished lung tissue damage. Maintaining a proper balance between anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is vital for ensuring an effective and safe antiviral immune response, and the results of this work show that water kefir and kefiran would help to maintain that balance promoting a controlled inflammatory response that defends against infection while minimizing tissue damage.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: This study investigated the impact of in vitro adaptations to acid and bile stress on the cholesterol-lowering activity of the probiotic Lactobacillus kefir M20. (2) Methods: Lactobacillus kefir M20 was extracted from fermented dairy products in Xinjiang, China, and isolated using MRS medium. The lactic acid bacteria were cultured for stress resistance to acid and bile salts and then gavaged into mice for animal experiments. (3) Results: The adaptation to bile stress treatment resulted in a notable enhancement of the cholesterol-lowering capacity of Lactobacillus kefir M20, with reductions of 16.5% and 33.1% in total and non-HDL cholesterol, respectively, compared to the untreated strain. Furthermore, the daily fecal total bile acid excretion was 9.2, 5.4 and 5.0 times higher in the M20-BSA group compared to the HC, M20 and M20-ASA groups, respectively. (4) Conclusions: This study suggests that targeted probiotics have the potential for application in the next generation of functional foods and probiotic formulations aimed at combating hypercholesterolemia."

      "abstract": "AIM: Preeclampsia is a complex and serious pregnancy disorder that leads to maternal and neonatal mortality worldwide. Kefir peptides (KPs), derived from various prebiotic fermentations in whole milk by kefir grains, were investigated for their potential therapeutic effects. In this study, we used the L-NAME in drinking water to induce a preeclampsia-like condition in spontaneous hypertension stroke-prone (SHRSP) pregnant rats. MAIN METHODS: The rats were assigned to five groups: the normal group (WKY rats), the untreated group (SHRSP rat control pregnant), the L-NAME/Mock group (SHRSP rats fed with L-NAME water), the L-NAME/KPs-LD group (SHRSP rats fed with L-NAME water and low-dose KPs diets), and the L-NAME/KPs-HD group (SHRSP rats fed with L-NAME water and high-dose KPs diets) for a 20-day experiment. Chorioallantois membrane (CAM) assay was applied for ex vivo angiogenesis study of KPs treatment. KEY FINDINGS: Data showed that rats in the L-NAME group developed severe hypertension, proteinuria, placental damage, and embryo resorption. Pre-administration of KPs significantly reduced hypertension, proteinuria, improved generalized endothelial dysfunction, and decreased levels of anti-HIF-1α, sFLT1, anti-TNF-α, and IL-6 in the placenta of SHRSP rats. In ex vivo CAM study, L-NAME administration in chicken embryos resulted in lower vessel density and hemorrhage; however, angiogenesis was observed after KPs-HD treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: The results indicate that kefir peptides improve renal lesions, prevent renal parenchyma damage, and balance endothelial and angiogenic dysfunction in both maternal and fetal sites in L-NAME-induced SHRSP pregnant rats.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition and the primary form of dementia among elderly people. The amyloidogenic hypothesis is the main theory that explains this phenomenon and describes the extracellular accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides. Model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster have been utilized to improve the understanding of this disease and its treatment. This study evaluated the effects of peptide and metabolic fractions of Brazilian kefir on a strain of D. melanogaster that expresses human Aβ peptide 1-42 in the eye. The parameters assessed included ommatidial organization, vacuole area, retinal thickness, and Aβ peptide quantification. The present study revealed that the fractions, particularly the peptidic fraction, significantly reduced the vacuole area and increased the retina thickness in treated flies, indicating an improvement in neurodegeneration phenotype. The peptidic fraction was also found to alter Aβ aggregation dynamics, inhibiting Aβ fibril formation, as revealed by dynamic light scattering. This study demonstrated that kefir fractions, particularly the peptidic fraction < 10 kDa, have the potential to regulate Aβ aggregation and alleviate neurodegeneration in a Drosophila melanogaster AD-like model. These findings suggest that kefir fractions could be viable for the bioprospection of novel drug prototypes for AD treatment, providing valuable insights into strategies targeting Aβ aggregation and neurodegeneration in AD.",

Gut microbiota disorders impact brain function via the bidirectional gut-brain axis, influencing behavior through inflammatory cascades, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter levels. This study highlights the potential effect of integrating lyophilized milk kefir alone and lyophilized milk kefir as solid carriers loaded with a self-nanoemulsifying self-nanosuspension (SNESNS) of licorice extract on an induced chronic IBD-like model in rats. Licorice-SNESNS was prepared by the homogenization of 30 mg of licorice extract in 1 g of the selected SNEDDS (30% Caraway oil, 60% Tween 20, and 10% propylene glycol (w/w)). Licorice-SNESNS was mixed with milk kefir and then freeze-dried. Dynamic TEM images and the bimodal particle size curve confirmed the formation of the biphasic nanosystems after dilution (nanoemulsion and nanosuspension). Daily oral administration of lyophilized milk kefir (100 mg/kg) loaded with SNESNS (10 mg/kg Caraway oil and 1 mg/kg licorice) restored normal body weight and intestinal mucosa while significantly reducing submucosal inflammatory cell infiltration in induced rats. Importantly, this treatment demonstrated superior efficacy compared to lyophilized milk kefir alone by leading to a more significant alleviation of neurotransmitter levels and improved memory functions, thereby addressing gut-brain axis disorders. Additionally, it normalized fecal microbiome constituents, inflammatory cytokine levels, and oxidative stress in examined tissues and serum. Moreover, daily administration of kefir-loaded SNESNS normalized the disease activity index, alleviated histopathological changes induced by IBD induction, and partially restored the normal gut microbiota. These alterations are associated with improved cognitive functions, attributed to the maintenance of normal neurotransmitter levels and the alleviation of triggered inflammatory factors and oxidative stress levels."

      "abstract": "Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is a widely accepted method for inducing depressive-like states in animal models. We decided to explore the effects of CUMS on the CantonS lineage of Drosophila melanogaster, which differs from the OregonR lineage in various ways. Additionally, we wanted to investigate the potential benefits of kefir in treating these chronically stressed flies, as previous research has shown promising results in using kefir components for depression treatment. To begin, we exposed male CantonS flies to a 10-day CUMS protocol and compared them to non-stressed flies. Within the stressed group, we had two subgroups: one treated with kefir (CUMS + Kefir group) and the other treated with sertraline (positive control). We then analysed various factors including serotonin levels, brain structure, markers of oxidative damage in lipids and proteins, and behavioural manifestations such as sociability, locomotor function, and anhedonic-like behaviour. Our results showed that flies exposed to CUMS experienced a decrease in serotonin levels without any signs of degeneration. They also exhibited reduced sociability, increased motor agitation, and decreased sucrose consumption, which are all indicative of stress-induced depressive-like behaviour. However, treatment with sertraline partially reversed these effects. Interestingly, treatment with kefir not only restored serotonin levels but also improved sociability and anhedonic-like behaviours. Additionally, flies in the CUMS + Kefir group had a longer lifespan compared to their untreated counterparts. These findings suggest that kefir has multiple advantageous effects on flies subjected to the 10-day CUMS protocol. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the CantonS lineage of D. melanogaster displays depressive-like manifestations after exposure to CUMS. Furthermore, kefir emerges as a powerful nutritional tool capable of reversing these effects and promoting beneficial outcomes in chronically stressed flies.",

Kefir has been shown to have many beneficial health effects; however, its effect on PCOS is unknown. This study aimed to examine the effect of kefir on the intestinal microbiota and health outcomes in PCOS. In this intervention study, 17 women with PCOS consumed 250 mL/day of kefir (containing Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefiranofaciens, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefirgranum, Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus parakefiri, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesentereoides, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Kluyveromyces lactis, Acetobacter pasteurianus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for 8 weeks. Food consumption and physical activity records, anthropometrical measurements, quality of life, and fecal and blood samples were taken at the study's beginning and end. Quality of life in mental health (58.8 ± 15.08; 64.0 ± 15.23, respectively) and physical function (95.00 and 100.00, respectively) categories showed a significant increase after kefir intervention (p < .05). Additionally, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), one of the inflammatory cytokines, significantly decreased (174.00 and 109.10 ng/L, respectively) (p < .05). The intestinal barrier permeability was evaluated with zonulin, and no significant change was observed. Gut microbiota analysis showed that while the relative abundance of the class Bacilli and genus Lactococcus significantly increased, the genus Holdemania decreased with kefir consumption (p < .05). In conclusion, kefir appears to be beneficial for improving the microbiota and some health outcomes, like reducing inflammation and improving quality of life in PCOS. Therefore, kefir may be useful in the treatment of PCOS."

      "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is the most commonly used effective alkylating drug in cancer treatment, but its use is restricted because its toxic side effect causes testicular toxicity. CTX disrupts the tissue redox and antioxidant balance and the resulting tissue damage causes oxidative stress. In our study based on this problem, kefir against CTX-induced oxidative stress and testicular toxicity were investigated. Rats were divided into 6 groups: control, 150 mg/kg CTX, 5 and 10 mg/kg kefir, 5 and 10 mg/kg kefir + 150 CTX. While the fermented kefirs were mixed and given to the rats for 12 days, CTX was given as a single dose on the 12th day of the experiment. Testis was scored according to spermatid density, giant cell formation, cells shed into tubules, maturation disorder, and atrophy. According to our biochemical findings, the high levels of total oxidant status (TOS), and the low levels of total antioxidant status (TAS) in the CTX group, which are oxidative stress markers, indicate the toxic effect of CTX, while the decrease in TOS levels and the increase in TAS levels in the kefir groups indicate the protective effect of kefir. In the CTX-administered group, tubules with impaired maturation and no spermatids were observed in the transverse section of the testicle, while in the kefir groups, the presence of near-normal tubule structures and tubule lumens despite CTX showed the protective effect of kefir. In our study, it was observed that kefir had a protective and curative effect on CTX-induced toxicity and oxidative stress and could be a strong protector.",

      "abstract": "Dairy products are an important source of protein and other nutrients in the Mediterranean diet. In these countries, the most common sources of milk for producing dairy products are cow, goat, sheep, and buffalo. Andalusia is traditionally the largest producer of goat milk in Spain. Kefir is a fermented product made from bacteria and yeasts and has health benefits beyond its nutritional properties. There is a lack of knowledge about the molecular mechanisms and metabolites that bring about these benefits. In this work, the combination of analytical techniques (GC-FID, UHPLC-MS-QToF, GC-QqQ-MS, and GC-ToF-MS) resulted in the detection of 105 metabolites in kefir produced with goat milk from two different thermal treatments (raw and pasteurized) fermented at four time points (12, 24, 36, and 48 h, using 0 h as the control). Of these, 27 metabolites differed between kefir produced with raw and pasteurized milk. These changes could possibly be caused by the effect of pasteurization on the microbial population in the starting milk. Some interesting molecules were identified, such as shikimic acid, dehydroabietic acid, GABA, and tyramine, which could be related to antibacterial properties, strengthening of the immune system, and arterial pressure. Moreover, a viability assay of the NIRS technique was performed to evaluate its use in monitoring the fermentation and classification of samples, which resulted in a 90% accuracy in comparison to correctly classified samples according to their fermentation time. This study represents the most comprehensive metabolomic analysis of goat milk kefir so far, revealing the intricate changes in metabolites during fermentation and the impact of milk treatment.",

This study evaluated Nigella sativa (black cumin) seeds (BCS) and kefir as alternatives to antibiotics for broilers. An in vivo study over a 28-day period, using 384 Cobb 500 male broilers organized into six treatment groups as part of a completely randomized block experimental design was conducted. Each treatment group included eight replicates, with each replicate containing eight birds. The treatments included positive control, negative control, antibiotic control, 5% BCS in feed, 20% kefir in drinking water, and a combination of 5% BCS and 20% kefir. NE was induced in broilers by administering ~5000 oocysts of Eimeria maxima orally on day 14, followed by inoculation with about 108 CFU/mL of Clostridium perfringens (Cp) (strain Cp#4) on days 19, 20, and 21. Live performance metrics including feed intake, body weight gain, and feed conversion were assessed in broilers. Additionally, NE disease outcomes such as lesion scores, mortality rates, and Cp populations in cecum were determined during the study. The BCS, kefir, and the combination had no detrimental effect on broiler live performance. BCS-treated and combination groups had lower NE scores (p > 0.05) in comparison to the positive control and exhibited no significant difference (p > 0.05) from antibiotic control. Additionally, treatment groups and antibiotic control were not significantly different (p > 0.05) in mortality, whereas the BCS and kefir combination significantly reduced (p < 0.05) mortality to 14.1% compared to 31.3% for the positive control. C. perfringens vegetative cells significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in treatments with BCS, kefir, and their combination on days 22 and 28 compared to the positive control. On day 22, Cp sores were significantly lower (p < 0.05) for the kefir and combination treatments compared to the positive control. In conclusion, BCS and kefir successfully reduced C. perfringens infection and mortality without any detrimental impact on broiler live performance with the combined treatment being the most effective. These results suggest that BCS and kefir could serve as potential alternatives to antibiotics in managing NE."

Following a 24-hour KE treatment subsequent to OTC exposure from 3 to 8 days post-fertilization of zebrafish larvae, molecular-level and microbiomic assessments revealed significant improvements. These included reduced expression of proinflammatory factors (IL-8 and IL-1β), increased antioxidant levels, and reversed unhealthy distribution of intestinal microbiota. Furthermore, KE supplementation showed potential in enhancing intestinal motility in the experiment of Nile red staining and fluorescent microbead transit. However, histological analysis showed that this short-term treatment with KE only partially reversed the intestinal morphological changes induced by OTC, suggesting that a longer treatment period might be necessary for complete restoration.",

      "abstract": "Fermented prebiotic and probiotic products with kefir are very important to slow down and prevent the growth of tumors and to treat cancer by stimulating the immune response against tumor cells. Cyclophosphamide (CPx) is widely preferred in cancer treatment but its effectiveness in high doses is restricted because of its side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of kefir against CPx-induced heart and liver toxicity. In an experiment, 42 Wistar albino rats were divided into six treatment groups: the control (Group 1), the group receiving 150 mg/kg CPx (Group 2), the groups receiving 5 and 10 mg/kg kefir (Groups 3 and 4) and the groups receiving 5 and 10 mg/kg kefir + CPx (Group 5 and 6). Fermented kefirs obtained on different days by traditional methods were mixed and given by gavage for 12 days, while a single dose of CPx was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) on the 12th day of the experiment. It was observed that alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB), ischemia modified albumin (IMA) and Troponin I values, which indicate oxidative stress, increased in the CPx-administered group, and this level approached that of the control in the CPx + kefir groups. Likewise, as a result of the kefir, the rats' CPx-induced histopathological symptoms were reduced, and their heart and liver tissue were significantly improved. In conclusion, it was observed that kefir had a cytoprotective effect against CPx-induced oxidative stress, hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity, bringing their biochemical parameters closer to those of the control by suppressing oxidative stress and reducing tissue damage."

      "abstract": "Although only Saccharomyces boulardii has been studied for ulcerative colitis (UC), probiotic yeasts have immense therapeutic potential. Herein, we evaluated the kefir yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus A4 (Km A4) and its anti-inflammatory effect with sulfasalazine in BALB/c mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Oral administration continued for 7 days after the mice were randomly divided into seven groups: control (CON, normal mice administered with saline), DSS-induced colitis mice administered saline (DSS), and DSS-induced colitis mice administered sulfasalazine only (S), Km A4 only (A4), Km A4 plus sulfasalazine (A4 + S), S. boulardii ATCC MYA-796 (Sb MYA-796) only (Sb), and Sb MYA-796 plus sulfasalazine (Sb + S). The β-glucan content of Km A4 was significantly higher than that of Sb MYA-796 (P < 0.05). Body weight gain (BWG) significantly correlated with colon length, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) levels, and Bacteroides abundance (P < 0.05). In colitis-induced mice, the A4 + S group had the lowest histological score (6.00) compared to the DSS group (12.67), indicating the anti-inflammatory effects of this combination. The A4 + S group showed significantly downregulated expression of interleukin (Il)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (Tnf-α), and Cox-2 and upregulated expression of Il-10 and occludin (Ocln) compared to the DSS group. Mice treated with A4 + S had enhanced Bacteroides abundance in their gut microbiota compared with the DSS group (P < 0.05). Bacteroides were significantly correlated with all colitis biomarkers (BWG, colon length, Il-6, Tnf-α, Il-10, Cox-2, and Ocln; P < 0.05). The anti-inflammatory effects of Km A4 could be attributed to high β-glucan content and gut microbiota modulation. Thus, treatment with Km A4 and sulfasalazine could alleviate UC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and life-threatening lung disease with high mortality rates. The limited availability of effective drugs for IPF treatment, coupled with concerns regarding adverse effects and restricted responsiveness, underscores the need for alternative approaches. Kefir peptides (KPs) have demonstrated antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties, along with the capability to modulate gut microbiota. This study aims to investigate the impact of KPs on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: Mice were treated with KPs for four days, followed by intratracheal injection of bleomycin for 21 days. Comprehensive assessments included pulmonary functional tests, micro-computed tomography (µ-CT), in vivo image analysis using MMPsense750, evaluation of inflammation- and fibrosis-related gene expression in lung tissue, and histopathological examinations. Furthermore, a detailed investigation of the gut microbiota community was performed using full-length 16 S rRNA sequencing in control mice, bleomycin-induced fibrotic mice, and KPs-pretreated fibrotic mice. RESULTS: In KPs-pretreated bleomycin-induced lung fibrotic mice, notable outcomes included the absence of significant bodyweight loss, enhanced pulmonary functions, restored lung tissue architecture, and diminished thickening of inter-alveolar septa, as elucidated by morphological and histopathological analyses. Concurrently, a reduction in the expression levels of oxidative biomarkers, inflammatory factors, and fibrotic indicators was observed. Moreover, 16 S rRNA sequencing demonstrated that KPs pretreatment induced alterations in the relative abundances of gut microbiota, notably affecting Barnesiella_intestinihominis, Kineothrix_alysoides, and Clostridium_viride. CONCLUSIONS: Kefir peptides exerted preventive effects, protecting mice against bleomycin-induced lung oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. These effects are likely linked to modifications in the gut microbiota community. The findings highlight the therapeutic potential of KPs in mitigating pulmonary fibrosis and advocate for additional exploration in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Water kefir grains (WKGs), the starter used to develop a traditional beverage named water kefir, consist of a symbiotic mixture of probiotics with diverse bioactivities, but little is known about their abilities to remove mycotoxins that have serious adverse effects on humans and animals. This study investigated the ability of WKGs to remove aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), one of the most toxic mycotoxins, under different settings, and determined the mechanism of absorption mediated by WKGs and the effect of WKGs on the toxicity induced by AFB1 and the reduction in AFB1 in cow milk and tea soups. The results showed the WKGs used herein were dominated by Lactobacillus, Acetobacter, Phenylobacterium, Sediminibacterium, Saccharomyces, Issatchenkia, and Kodamaea. HPLC analysis demonstrated that the WKGs effectively removed AFB1 at concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 µg/mL, pH values ranging from 3 to 9, and temperatures ranging from 4 to 45 °C. Additionally, the removal of AFB1 mainly depended on absorption, which was consistent with the Freundlich and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Moreover, only 49.63% of AFB1 was released from the AFB1-WKG complex after four washes when the release of AFB1 was non-detectable. Furthermore, WKG treatment caused a dramatic reduction in the mutagenicity induced by AFB1 according to an Ames test and reduced more than 54% of AFB1 in cow milk and three tea soups. These results suggested that WKGs can act as a potential bio-absorbent with a high binding ability to detoxify AFB1 in food and feed via a chemical action step and multi-binding sites of AFB1 absorption in a wide range of scenarios.",

Sweet whey permeates and SWP supplemented with 1.5% milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) proved to be the most viable by-products for kefir grain fermentation, exhibiting diverse abundance of traditional kefir microorganisms and positive indicators of bioactive properties. Grain viability was assessed with shotgun metagenomics, texture profile analysis, live cell counts, and scanning electron microscopy. Assessed bioactivities of the kefir-like products included antibacterial, antioxidant, potential anticancerogenic properties, and membrane barrier effects on human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells. All kefir grains were most abundant in Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens when analyzed with shotgun metagenomics. When analyzed with live cell counts on selective media, AWP kefir-like product had no countable Lactococcus spp., indicating suboptimal conditions for kefir grain microbiota survival and application for fermented dairy starter culture bacterium. Live cell counts were affirmed with kefir grain surface scanning electron microscopy images. The SWP treatment had the most adhesive kefir grain surface, and SWP+MFGM had the largest exopolysaccharide yield from grain extraction. All kefir and kefir-like products were able to achieve a 6-log reduction against Listeria innocua and Escherichia coli. Traditional milk kefirs had the highest antioxidant capacity for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and the 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid; ABTS) assay. The AWP formulation had a significantly higher DPPH antioxidant activity compared with the other kefir and kefir-like products, and SWP had the lowest Trolox equivalence concentration in the ABTS assay. Sweet whey and supplemented milk fat sweet whey had upregulation of Cldn-1 and Ocln-1 gene expression, which correspond with a significant increase in transepithelial electrical resistance.",

We established an UC murine model by orally administrating with 109 CFUs of Fusobacterium nucleatum for 3 weeks and 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment in the third week. KS was used to intervene in this colitis model. Our results showed that KS supplementation ameliorated the symptoms, restrained the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17F), promoted the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), and ameliorated oxidative stress. Furthermore, the increased number of goblet cells and upregulated expression of MUC2, occludin and claudin-1 indicated that the colon barrier was protected by KS. Additionally, KS supplementation mitigated gut microbiota dysbiosis in the UC murine model, leading to an increase in the abundance of Blautia and Akkermansia and a decrease in the level of Bacteroides. The altered gut microbiota also affected colon metabolism, with differential metabolites mainly associated with the biosynthesis of the l-arginine pathway. This study revealed that KS supplementation restored the community structure of gut microbiota, altered the biosynthesis of l-arginine, and thereby modulated the process of colonic inflammation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Current interventions for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are primarily medication, behavioural therapy and parent training. However, research suggests dietary manipulations may provide therapeutic benefit for some. There is accumulating evidence that the gut microbiome may be atypical in ADHD, and therefore, manipulating gut bacteria in such individuals may help alleviate some of the symptoms of this condition. The aim of this study is to explore the effects of supplementation with kefir (a fermented dairy drink) on ADHD symptomatology, sleep, attention and the gut microbiome in children diagnosed with ADHD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A 6-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 70 children aged 8-13 years diagnosed with ADHD. Participants will be recruited throughout the UK, through support groups, community groups, schools, social media and word of mouth. Children will be randomised to consume daily either dairy kefir or a placebo dairy drink for 6 weeks. The primary outcome, ADHD symptomatology, will be measured by The Strengths and Weakness of ADHD-symptoms and Normal-behaviour scale. Secondary outcomes will include gut microbiota composition (using shotgun metagenomic microbiome sequencing), gut symptomatology (The Gastrointestinal Severity Index questionnaire), sleep (using 7-day actigraphy recordings, The Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire and Sleep Self Report questionnaire), inattention and impulsivity (with a computerised Go/NoGo test). Assessments will be conducted prior to the intervention and at the end of the intervention. Interaction between time (preintervention/postintervention) and group (probiotic/placebo) is to be analysed using a Mixed Model Analysis of Variances. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study was granted by St Mary's University Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, presentations to the scientific community and support groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05155696.",

Male Swiss mice were divided into three groups: control (Vehicle; UHT milk at a dose of 0.3 mL/100 g), proton pump inhibitor (PPI; lansoprazole 30 mg/kg), and 4% milk kefir (Kefir; 0.3 mL/100 g). After 14 days of treatment, gastric ulcer was induced by oral administration of indomethacin (40 mg/kg). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), DNA content, cellular apoptosis, IL-10 and TNF-α levels, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme activity were determined. The interaction networks between NADPH oxidase 2 and kefir peptides 1-35 were determined using the Residue Interaction Network Generator (RING) webserver. Pretreatment with kefir for 14 days prevented gastric lesions. In addition, kefir administration reduced ROS production, DNA fragmentation, apoptosis, and TNF-α systemic levels. Simultaneously, kefir increased NO bioavailability in gastric cells and IL-10 systemic levels. A total of 35 kefir peptides showed affinity with NADPH oxidase 2. These findings suggest that the gastroprotective effect of kefir is due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Kefir could be a promising natural therapy for gastric ulcers, opening new perspectives for future research.",

Kefir has been studied for its properties of anti-obesity, rebuilding intestinal homeostasis, and alleviating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the possible role of kefir in the prevention or treatment of ALD has not been carefully considered. Here, it evaluated the protective effects of kefir supplementation on alcohol-induced liver injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice are fed to Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing alcohol to build ALD mouse model, followed by oral administration with kefir. Results indicate that kefir treatment improves liver pathological changes, decreases the expression levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and inflammatory markers, and increases antioxidant levels. Kefir supplementation also restores the intestinal barrier and altered microbial composition, indicates as increases of Blautia, Bacteroides, and Parasutterella and decreases in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and populations of Psychrobacter, Bacillus, and Monoglobus. Moreover, kefir supplementation decreases the levels of total bile acids (BAs) and primary BAs and increases the secondary/primary BA ratio. Gut microbes play a key role in the conversion of primary to secondary fecal BAs. CONCLUSION: Kefir can ameliorate ALD through regulating the composition of the gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "A novel kefir exopolysaccharides (KEPS) derived from kefir grain fermentation were found to have a small molecular weight (12 kDa) compared to the traditionally high molecular weight (12,000 kDa) of kefiran (KE). KE has been shown to possess antioxidant, blood pressure-lowering, and immune-modulating effects. In this study, we characterized KEPS and KE and evaluated their anti-inflammatory properties in vitro using RAW264.7 macrophages. The main monosaccharide components were identified as glucose (98.1 ± 0.06%) in KEPS and galactose (45.36 ± 0.16%) and glucose (47.13 ± 0.06%) in KE, respectively. Both KEPS and KE significantly reduced IL-6 secretion in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. We further investigated their effects in LPS-induced systemic injury in male and female NF-κB-luciferase+/+ transgenic mice. Mice received oral KEPS (100 mg/kg) or KE (100 mg/kg) for seven days, followed by LPS or saline injection. KEPS and KE inhibited NF-κB signaling, as indicated by reduced luciferase expression and phosphorylated NF-κB levels. LPS-induced systemic injury increased luciferase signals, especially in the kidney, spleen, pancreas, lung, and gut tissues of female mice compared to male mice. Additionally, it upregulated inflammatory mediators in these organs. However, KEPS and KE effectively suppressed the expression of inflammatory mediators, including p-MAPK and IL-6. These findings demonstrate that KEPS can alleviate LPS-induced systemic damage by inhibiting NF-κB/MAPK signaling, suggesting their potential as a treatment for inflammatory disorders."

The present study aims to evaluate the in vivo anti-diabetic potential of the isolated Lactobacillus paracasei from Malaysian water kefir grains (MWKG) which was reported to have excellent probiotic properties and high antioxidant activities as reported previously. High-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ) induction was used to obtain a T2DM model followed by treatment with the isolated L. paracasei from MWKG. The levels of glucose, insulin, and in vivo liver antioxidants were quantified after 14 weeks. Gene expression analysis of the liver was also carried out using microarray analysis, and several genes were selected for validation using quantitative real-time PCR. Insulin tolerance test demonstrated that the L. paracasei isolated from the MWKG alleviated T2DM by improving the area under the curve of the insulin tolerance test whereby low-dose and high-dose concentrations treated groups showed 2424.50 ± 437.02 mmol/L·min and 2017.50 ± 347.09 mmol/L·min, respectively, compared to untreated diabetic mice which was 3884.50 ± 39.36 mmol/L·min. Additionally, treatment with the isolated L. paracasei from MWKG regulated the expression of several genes related to glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism in diabetic mice. These results suggested that the isolated L. paracasei from MWKG could be a potential dietary supplement for T2DM.",

      "abstract": "Kefir is a fermented dairy beverage that has been consumed by humans for centuries, but poorly studied in pets. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of commercial or traditional kefir supplementation on apparent total tract macronutrient digestibility (ATTD) and fecal characteristics, microbiota populations, and metabolite and immunoglobulin (Ig) A concentrations of healthy adult dogs. Twelve healthy adult dogs (5.67 ± 1.72 yr, 7.27 ± 1.15 kg) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design (n = 12/group). All dogs were fed a commercial diet and allotted to 1 of 3 treatments (60 mL/d): 2% reduced-fat milk treated with lactase [CNTL; 4.57E + 03 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL], commercial kefir (C-Kefir; 6.95E + 04 LAB CFU/mL), or traditional kefir brewed daily from 2% reduced-fat milk and kefir grains (T-Kefir; 1.79E + 09 LAB CFU/mL). The experiment was composed of three 28-d periods, with each consisting of a 22-d transition phase, a 5-d fecal collection phase, and 1 d for blood collection. Fecal samples were collected for determination of ATTD and fecal pH, dry matter, microbiota, and metabolite, and IgA concentrations. Data were analyzed using the Mixed Models procedure of SAS 9.4. The main effects of treatment were tested, with significance set at P ≤ 0.05 and trends set at P ≤ 0.10. Kefir products differed in microbial density and profile, but fecal microbiota populations were weakly impacted. Bacterial alpha diversity tended to be greater (P = 0.10) in dogs fed T-Kefir than those fed CNTL. Bacterial beta diversity analysis identified a difference (P < 0.0004) between dogs-fed CNTL and those fed C-Kefir. Dogs-fed C-Kefir tended to have a greater (P = 0.06) relative abundance of Fusobacteriota than those fed CNTL or T-Kefir. Dogs-fed T-Kefir had a greater (P < 0.0001) relative abundance of Lactococcus than those fed CNTL or C-Kefir. Dogs-fed T-Kefir also tended to have a lower (P = 0.09) relative abundance of Escherichia Shigella and greater (P = 0.09) relative abundance of Candidatus stoquefichus than dogs-fed CNTL or C-Kefir. Dogs-fed C-Kefir tended to have lower (P = 0.08) fecal valerate concentrations than those fed CNTL or T-Kefir. All other measures were unaffected by kefir treatments. Our results suggest that kefir supplementation had minor effects on the fecal microbiota populations and fecal metabolite concentrations of healthy adult dogs without impacting ATTD, fecal characteristics, or fecal IgA concentrations.",

We hypothesized that kefir and yacon can improve bone and intestinal health and that their synbiotic effects will enhance these benefits. The properties of yacon and kefir and their association were evaluated in the intestinal and bone health in rats. Forty Wistar male rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 10): control (C), kefir (K), yacon (Y), and yacon + kefir (YK) and received an AIN-93 M diet containing 50% of the daily recommendation of calcium for 42 days. Group K received 1 mL/day of kefir containing 10⁸ CFU/mL; group Y received yacon flour (5% fructooligosaccharides); and the YK group received the same treatment as the Y and K groups. Urine and feces were collected to determine the calcium balance. Serum biomarkers of bone formation and resorption, osteocalcin, N telopeptides of collagen type I and C-telopeptide of collagen type I, intraluminal pH, intestinal permeability, and secretory immunoglobulin A were evaluated. Yacon reduced intraluminal pH alone or in association with kefir (groups Y and YK). Yacon also improved intestinal permeability (lowered lactulose and mannitol excretion) and increased calcium balance and osteocalcin, a biomarker of bone formation. In turn, K improved immunity by increasing secretory immunoglobulin A secretion and reducing bone resorption biomarkers (C-telopeptide of collagen type I and N telopeptides of collagen type I). Thus, yacon and kefir had beneficial effects on intestinal and bone health; however, the association between them did not demonstrate a synbiotic effect.",

However, kefir products have limited acceptance among Western consumers due to their characteristic flavor and texture. Plain, unsweetened commercial kefir with 1% milkfat was subjected to vacuum evaporation and freeze-drying processes to assess the effect on volatile organic compound concentration, sensory quality, and microbial viability. Vacuum evaporation and freeze-drying both significantly decreased the concentration of 26 out of 27 volatiles in the kefir (p < 0.05), by an average of 61%. Vacuum evaporation exhibited an apparent greater reduction than freeze-drying in the concentrations of the ketones and aldehydes, while freeze-drying showed a more noticeable reduction in the concentrations of the acids, alcohols, and esters. While lowering the concentration of volatiles did not significantly improve the average consumer acceptance of commercial kefir, both treatments showed differences in the range of acceptability responses. Both treatments also produced a small but significant reduction in the concentrations of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus species present.",

      "abstract": "Kefir is a fermented beverage made of a symbiotic microbial community that stands out for health benefits. Although its microbial profile is still little explored, its effects on modulation of gut microbiota and production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) seems to act by improving brain health. This work aimed to analyze the microbiota profile of milk kefir and its effect on metabolism, oxidative stress, and in the microbiota-gut-brain axis in a murine model. The experimental design was carried out using C57BL-6 mice (n = 20) subdivided into groups that received 0.1 mL water or 0.1 mL (10% w/v) kefir. The kefir proceeded to maturation for 48 h, and then it was orally administered, via gavage, to the animals for 4 weeks. Physicochemical, microbiological, antioxidant analyzes, and microbial profiling of milk kefir beverage were performed as well as growth parameters, food intake, serum markers, oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes, SCFAs, and metabarcoding were analyzed in the mice. Milk kefir had 76.64 ± 0.42% of free radical scavenging and the microbiota composed primarily by the genus Comamonas. Moreover, kefir increased catalase and superoxide dismutase (colon), and SCFAs in feces (butyrate), and in the brain (butyrate and propionate). Kefir reduced triglycerides, uric acid, and affected the microbiome of animals increasing fecal butyrate-producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Lachnoclostridium). Our results on the brain and fecal SCFAs and the antioxidant effect found were associated with the change in the gut microbiota caused by kefir, which indicates that kefir positively influences the gut-microbiota-brain axis and contributes to the preservation of gut and brain health. KEY POINTS: • Milk kefir modulates fecal microbiota and SCFA production in brain and colon. • Kefir treatment increases the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria. • Milk kefir increases antioxidant enzymes and influences the metabolism of mice.",

Moreover, a solid bilateral association between NAFLD and depression has been shown, which may alleviate by kefir consumption. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of milk kefir drinks on the depression status of individuals with NAFLD. METHODS: In a secondary outcome analysis of a randomized, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial, 80 adults with grades 1 to 3 of NAFLD were included in an 8-week intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to Diet or Diet + kefir groups to either follow a low-calorie diet or a low-calorie diet along with a 500 cc milk kefir drink daily. The participants' demographic, anthropometric, dietary, and physical data were recorded before and after the study. Depression status was assessed using the Persian format of the second version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II-Persian) at the baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: Overall, 80 participants aged 42.87 ± 10.67 years were included in the analysis. The data on the baseline demographic, dietary, and physical activity of the groups were not significantly different. During the study, participants in Diet + Kefir group had a significantly decreased energy (P = 0.02), carbohydrate (P = 0.4), and fat consumption (P = 0.4). However, during the study, the depression score was not significantly reduced in the Diet group, the Diet + Kefir group showed a significant reduction in depression (P = 0.02). However, between-group analyses for changes in depression were not significant (P = 0.59). CONCLUSION: Consumption of milk kefir drink for 8 weeks may not reduce depression symptoms in adults with NAFLD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at IRCT.ir as IRCT20170916036204N6 (August 2018)."

Blending different biopolymers is an alternative approach to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed new biopolymeric blend materials based on the entire biomasses of water kefir grains and yeast. Film-forming dispersions with varying ratios of water kefir to yeast (100/0, 75/25, 50/50 25/75 and 0/100) underwent ultrasonic homogenisation and thermal treatment, resulting in homogeneous dispersions with pseudoplastic behaviour and interaction between both biomasses. Films obtained by casting had a continuous microstructure without cracks or phase separation. Infrared spectroscopy revealed the interaction between the blend components, leading to a homogeneous matrix. As the water kefir content in the film increased, transparency, thermal stability, glass transition temperature and elongation at break also increased. The thermogravimetric analyses and the mechanical tests showed that the combination of water kefir and yeast biomasses resulted in stronger interpolymeric interactions compared to single biomass films. The ratio of the components did not drastically alter hydration and water transport. Our results revealed that blending water kefir grains and yeast biomasses enhanced thermal and mechanical properties. These studies provided evidence that the developed materials are suitable candidates for food packaging applications."

This study aimed to compare how consumption of a commercial kefir without traditional kefir organisms and a pitched kefir containing traditional organisms affected plasma lipid levels, glucose homeostasis, and markers of endothelial function and inflammation in males with elevated LDL cholesterol. We utilized a crossover design in n = 21 participants consisting of two treatments of 4 weeks each in random order separated by a 4-week washout. Participants received either commercial kefir or pitched kefir containing traditional kefir organisms for each treatment period. Participants consumed 2 servings of kefir (350 g) per day. Plasma lipid profile, glucose, insulin, markers of endothelial function, and inflammation were measured in the fasting state before and after each treatment period. Differences within each treatment period and comparison of treatment delta values were performed using paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, respectively. When compared to baseline, pitched kefir consumption reduced LDL-C, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, while commercial kefir consumption increased TNF-α. Pitched kefir consumption resulted in greater reductions in IL-8, CRP, VCAM-1, and TNF-α when compared to commercial kefir consumption. These findings provide strong evidence that microbial composition is an important factor in the metabolic health benefits associated with kefir consumption. They also provide support for larger studies examining these to assess whether traditional kefir organisms are necessary to confer health benefits to individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular disease.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the effects of this kefir beverage on cardiometabolic risk factors. METHODS: Literature search utilised PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar for articles published from inception until June 2021. Cardiometabolic risk indices extracted included insulin and insulin resistance (HOMA_IR), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting blood sugar (FBS), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight (BW). In total, six RCTs (314 subjects) were selected for the meta-analysis. Inverse-variance weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the mean changes in TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, FBS, HbA1c and BW compared to baseline. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled WMD. RESULTS: Kefir intake significantly reduced fasting insulin (WMD: -3.69 micro-IU/mL,95% CI: -6.30 to -1.07, p = 0.006, I2 = 0.0%) and HOMA-IR (WMD: -2.56, 95% CI: -3.82 to -1.30, p<0.001, I2 = 19.4%). No effect on TC (p = 0.088), TG (p = 0.824), HDL-C (p = 0.491), LDL-C (p = 0.910), FBS (p = 0.267), HbA1c (p = 0.339) or body weight (p = 0.439) were found for kefir treatment. CONCLUSION: Kefir has a beneficial effect in decreasing insulin resistance; however, no effect was seen on BW, FBS, HbA1C, and lipid profile.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) and osteoporosis were previously considered two distinct diseases. However, current understanding indicates that they share common pathogenetic mechanisms. The available medicines for treating VC and osteoporosis are limited. We previously demonstrated that kefir peptides (KPs) alleviated atherosclerosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE -/- ) mice. The present study further addressed the preventive effects of KPs on VC and osteoporosis in ApoE -/- mice fed a high-cholesterol atherogenic diet (AD). Main methods: Seven-week-old ApoE -/- and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6). The development of VC and osteoporosis was evaluated after AD feeding for 13 weeks in KP-treated ApoE -/- mice and compared to C57BL/6 and ApoE -/- mice fed a standard chow diet (CD). Key findings: The results indicated that KP-treated ApoE -/- mice exhibited lower serum total cholesterol, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine kinase (CK) activities, which suggested that KPs prevented hyperlipidemia and possible damages to the liver and muscle in ApoE -/- mice. KPs reduced serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the local expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and macrophage-specific CD68 markers in aortic tissues, which suggested that KPs inhibited inflammatory responses in AD-fed ApoE -/- mice. KPs reduced the deposition of lipid, collagen, and calcium minerals in the aortic roots of AD-fed ApoE -/- mice, which suggested that KPs inhibited the calcific progression of atherosclerotic plaques. KPs exerted osteoprotective effects in AD-fed ApoE -/- mice, which was evidenced by lower levels of the bone resorption marker CTX-1 and higher levels of the bone formation marker P1NP. KPs improved cortical bone mineral density and bone volume and reduced trabecular bone loss in femurs. Significance: The present data suggested that KPs attenuated VC and osteoporosis by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in AD-fed ApoE -/- mice. Our findings contribute to the application of KPs as preventive medicines for the treatment of hyperlipidemia-induced vascular and bone degeneration."

      "abstract": "Increasing research has been conducted on the role of probiotics in disease treatment. Kefir, a safe, low-cost probiotic fermented milk drink, has been investigated in many in vitro and animal studies, although parameters for human therapeutic dose or treatment time have not yet been determined. Here we perform a scoping review of clinical studies that have used kefir as a therapeutic agent, compiling the results for perspectives to support and direct further research. This review was based on Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, including studies on the effects of kefir-fermented milk in humans. Using the term KEFIR, the main international databases were searched for studies published in English, Spanish or Portuguese until 9 March 2022. A total of 5835 articles were identified in the four databases, with forty-four eligible for analysis. The research areas were classified as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal health/disorders, maternal/child health and paediatrics, dentistry, oncology, women's and geriatric health, and dermatology. The many study limitations hampered generalisation of the results. The small sample sizes, methodological variation and differences in kefir types, dosage and treatment duration prevented clear conclusions about its benefits for specific diseases. We suggest using a standard therapeutic dose of traditionally prepared kefir in millilitres according to body weight, making routine consumption more feasible. The studies showed that kefir is safe for people without serious illnesses.",

However, host gut microbiota modulation of kefir yeasts remains unclear. Here, we compared kefir yeast strains K. marxianus A4 (Km A4) and K. marxianus A5 (Km A5) with Saccharomyces boulardii ATCC MYA-796 (Sb MYA-796) by investigating their adherence to colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells and gut microbiota modulation in BALB/c mice. The kefir yeast strains exhibited higher intestinal cell adhesion than Sb MYA-796 (p < 0.05). Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidales, and Bacteroides were more abundant in the 1 × 108 CFU/mL of Km A4 treatment group than in the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, 1 × 108 CFU/mL of Km A5 increased Corynebacteriales and Corynebacterium compared to the 1 × 108 CFU/mL of Km A4 treatment group (p < 0.01). The results showed that Km A4 and Km A5 had good Caco-2 cell adhesion ability and modulated gut microbiota upon short-term administration in healthy mice.

This work was conducted to prepare a real champagne yoghurt and explore the difference between it and ordinary yoghurt. The nutritional evaluation of the two treatment groups was carried out by amino acid analysis, and the volatile flavour substances of the two treatment groups were detected by solid phase microextraction (SPME)-gas chromatograph (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS). Results showed that the addition of acetic acid bacteria and yeast increased the water content of kefir, resulting in a decrease in its water-holding rate. Moreover, the increase in acidity weakened the connection between the protein networks, the flocculent protein structure was not more densely stacked than the L1 group, and the internal bonds were unstable. The rheological results showed that the apparent viscosity decreased faster with the increase in shear force. The CLSM and LF-NMR showed that the hydration and degree of freedom of kefir yoghurt protein decreased, resulting in an increased protein network density. The SEM showed that the cross-linking between kefir casein clusters was considerably tight to form small chains, the pore distribution was uneven, and a weak cheese structure was formed. In addition, the volatile flavour substances in the kefir group increased the phenylethyl alcohol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol compared with those in the L1 group, with a slight refreshing taste brought by alcohol and special soft malt alcohol aroma and rose aroma not found in ordinary yoghurt, which was more in line with the characteristics and taste of traditional kefir champagne yoghurt.

      "abstract": "This study aims to characterize the microbiota and peptidomic composition of raw milk kefir, and to address the potential anti-allergic effects of raw milk kefir using validated research models for food allergy. Raw milk kefir was produced after incubation with a defined freeze-dried starter culture. Kefir was sampled during fermentation at seven time intervals. For comparison, kefir was also prepared from heat-treated milk. Peptide compositions were determined for the raw and heated milk, and kefir end products made from these milks. In a murine food allergy model, the two kefir end products were investigated for their allergy modulating effects. In both kefirs, we identified amplicon sequence variants identical to those in the starter culture, matching the bacteria Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Leuconostoc and the yeast Debaryomyces. In raw milk kefir, additional sequence variants of Lactococcus lactis and the yeasts Pichia and Galactomyces could be identified, which were absent in heated milk kefir. Analysis of peptide compositions in both kefirs indicated that the number and intensity of peptides drastically increased after fermentation. Heating of the milk negatively affected the diversity of the peptide composition in kefir. Only raw milk kefir suppressed the acute allergic skin response to the food allergen ovalbumin in sensitised mice. These effects coincided with differences in the T-cell compartment, with lower percentages of activated Th1 cells and IFNg production after treatment with kefir made from heated milk. The results of this study indicate specific properties of raw milk kefir that may contribute to its additional health benefits.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease. Its pathological features are synovial inflammation, bone erosion, and joint structural damages. Our previous studies have shown that kefir peptides (KPs) can reduce cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and renal inflammation. In this study, we further evaluate the efficacy of KPs on adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in a rat model. MAIN METHODS: After the 14th day of adjuvant induction, rats were subsequently orally administered KPs (83 or 166 mg/day/kg) or tofacitinib (6.2 mg/day/kg) for 14 days. On the 28th day, the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane for ultrasonic, in vivo imaging system (IVIS), and radiographic imaging and then sacrificed for ankle tissues collection and analysis. In vitro, IL-1β-treated human synovial cells (SW982) were subjected to anti-arthritis mechanism study in the presence of KPs. KEY FINDINGS: The results of ultrasonography, radiograph, histology, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), inflammatory cytokines and RANKL/OPG ratio demonstrated decreasing severity of synovitis and bone erosion in the ankle joints after KPs treatment. Activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways was significantly reduced in KPs treated AIA group. Furthermore, KPs attenuated IL-1β-induced inflammatory cytokine production and the expression of MMPs in a human synovial cell line SW982. These results demonstrated that KPs alleviated adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats by inhibiting IL-1β-related inflammation and MMPs production. SIGNIFICANCE: We concluded that KPs can exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the levels of macrophage-related inflammatory cytokines and MMPs, thus alleviating bone erosion in the ankle joint and constituting a potential therapeutic strategy for rheumatoid arthritis.",

      "abstract": "The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a dynamic system influenced by various environmental factors, including diet and exposure to ingested probiotics, and prone to various functional impairments. These impairments are mostly related to any combination of motility alterations, visceral hypersensitivity, and changes in the mucosa, immune function, and intestinal microbiota. Intestinal microbial imbalance and immunological dysfunction have been linked to several chronic inflammatory disease states, including atopic dermatitis (AD). Disruption of the intestinal microbial balance, known as gut dysbiosis, has been demonstrated to negatively impact skin function by increasing the intestinal permeability. Consequently, the gut-skin axis may be receptive to modulation via dietary modification, namely, via ingestion of probiotics, thus representing interesting potential as an AD therapy. Kefir is an ancient probiotic food that has been demonstrated to positively impact the general condition of the digestive system, including the intestinal microbiota. However, the literature is still scarce on the impact on the gut-skin relationship of a diet containing kefir. This study, continuing research in our group, aimed to evaluate the impact of kefir intake on GI symptoms in healthy and AD skin subjects. Results showed a significant improvement in GI status, namely, in functional constipation, abdominal pain intensity, and abdominal distension, thus supporting the hypothesis that kefir intake is positively associated with improvement in GI status. The existence of a relationship between the improvement in skin parameters and the improvement in GI status after kefir consumption was established, thus reinforcing the role of homemade kefir as a potential modulator of the gut-skin axis in both healthy and atopic individuals.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Fractures are the result of fragile bone structures after trauma caused by direct or indirect external impact or strong muscular contraction. Most fracture patients undergo surgical fixation to accelerate the healing process and restore the function of mutilated bone. Promoting the healing process remains an important issue for the treatment of bone fractures. Our previous studies demonstrated the remarkable bone-protective effects of kefir peptides (KPs) in ovariectomized rats and mice. In this study, we further evaluate the efficacy of KPs on fracture healing using a rat model of femoral fracture. MAIN METHODS: Fifteen 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were divided into the sham, mock, and KPs groups, in which the mock and the KPs groups underwent femur-fracture surgery with nail fixation, while the sham group underwent a sham operation. The next day, rats were orally administered with daily 400 mg/kg of KPs (KPs group) or distilled water (sham and mock groups) for four weeks. X-ray imaging, histochemical staining and serum osteogenic markers were applied for fracture healing evaluation. In vitro, mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and MC3T3-E1 line were subjected to osteoblast differentiation in the presence of KPs and compared with no KPs treatment. KEY FINDINGS: The results demonstrated that KPs treatment improved the progression of the fracture healing process (p < 0.05) and significantly increased the expressions of Col1a1, Alp, Spp1, Vegfa and Cox2 mRNA in the femurs of the KPs-treated fractured rats compared to those of the mock-treated fracture rats. In vitro, KPs treatment promoted bone regeneration factor (Col1a1, Alp, M-csf and Phospho1) expression in MC3T3-E1-derived osteoblast cultures (on Day 3) and enhanced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization in BMMSC-derived osteoblast cultures (on Day 17 and Day 21). SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to show that KPs can help with fracture healing by promoting osteogenic differentiation, and it also suggests that KPs can be used as a nutritional supplement to accelerate fracture healing.",

      "abstract": "The AKR1A1 protein is a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily that catalyzes the transformation of D-glucuronate to L-gulonate in the synthesis of L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C, Vit C). We previously demonstrated that AKR1A1 knockout mice (AKR1A1eGFP/eGFP) with Vit C deficiency exhibited aberrant bone formation and osteoporosis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the osteoprotective effects of kefir peptides (KPs) in AKR1A1eGFP/eGFP mice and uncover the underlying mechanism of KPs in the modulation of bone remodeling. Six male CD-1 mice and 24 male AKR1A1eGFP/eGFP mice were used in this study, in which the AKR1A1eGFP/eGFP mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6). KPs treatment for 12 weeks exerted several effects in AKR1A1eGFP/eGFP mice including the reduction of serum proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), bone resorption markers (CTX-1, RANKL), and the increase of serum bone formation markers (P1NP, OPG, OC). μ-CT analysis indicated that KPs prevented the bone loss in the femurs of AKR1A1eGFP/eGFP mice by significantly increasing the trabecular parameters of bone mineral density, bone volume and bone number. Nanoindentation analysis demonstrated that KPs enhanced the elasticity and hardness of femoral cortical bones in AKR1A1eGFP/eGFP mice. KPs promoted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs)-derived osteoblast differentiation and mineralization by upregulating positive regulators of osteoblastogenesis (Runx2, β-catenin, BMP-2, NFATc1). Conversely, KPs inhibited bone marrow macrophages (BMMs)-derived osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, which was demonstrated by the facts that KPs suppressed RANKL-induced p38, NF-κB, Akt, PLCγ2 and CREB-1 phosphorylation, decreased the nuclear translocation of NFATc1 and c-Fos. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of KPs in the prevention of osteoporosis in AKR1A1eGFP/eGFP mice and also unveil the dual effects of KPs in osteogenic promotion and osteoclastic inhibition. This study supports the use of KPs as nutritional supplements for the prevention of osteoporosis.",

This study aims to find a strain with a good promoting effect on PD-1 inhibitor treatment from 5 probiotic strains with the function of modulating the gut microbiota or enhancing immunity. A preclinical study on the effect of probiotics combined with PD-1 inhibitors in murine melanoma was designed. In this study, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW18 (ZW18) was found to have the best anti-melanoma effect among the probiotic candidates in PD-1 inhibitor treatment. ZW18 inhibited the tumor growth in PD-1-treated mice with an inhibition rate of 66.16% by activating the body's immunity and promoting the tumor CD8+ T cell infiltration. Moreover, the supplement of ZW18 optimized the composition of the gut microbiota in mice treated with PD-1 inhibitors, and significantly increased the abundance of Akkermansia, the Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group and Muribaculum. Collectively, ZW18 could be regarded as a potential candidate strain for promoting tumor immunotherapy. ZW18 combined with PD-1 inhibitors has a possibility of serving as a functional food to assist tumor immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Kefir consists of a large number of probiotics, which can regulate or shape the balance of intestinal microbiota, and enhance the host's immune response. Kefir microbiota can shape the mucosal immunity of the body through SCFAs, EPS, polypeptides, lactic acid, and other metabolites and microbial antigens themselves, and this shaping may have time windows and specific pathways. Kefir can regulate antibody SIgA and IL-10 levels to maintain intestinal homeostasis, and its secreted SIgA can shape the stable microbiota system by wrapping and binding different classes of microorganisms. The incidence of intestinal inflammation is closely linked to the development and maturation of intestinal mucosal immunity. Based on summarizing the existing research results on Kefir, its metabolites, and immune system development, this paper proposes to use Kefir, traditional fermented food with natural immune-enhancing components and stable functional microbiota, as an intervention method. Early intervention in the immune system may seize the critical window period of mucosal immunity and stimulate the development and maturation of intestinal mucosal immunity in time.",

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) has emerged as a challenge after long-term glucocorticoids (GCs) administration. Exercise has been an important non-pharmacological option, while medications modulate bone remodeling despite adverse effects. In this way, milk Kefir (MK) therapy stands out as a safe alternative to improve bone metabolism. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of MK associated to resistance exercise on bone loss in rats with GIO. For this, sixty male Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups: normal (N) and subjected to GIO, which was subdivided into 4 groups: control (C), milk kefir therapy (K), Exercise (Ex), and Exercise+K (ExK). GIO was induced by dexamethasone (7 mg/kg - i.m.; 1×/wk, 5 wk). MK was administered daily (1×/day; 0.7 ml/animal) and the climb exercise with load was performed 3×/wk; both for 16 wk. Femur was collected for assessment of bone microarchitecture, quality and metabolism. GIO markedly reduced trabecular bone volume density (BV/TV) (-35 %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) (-33 %), mineral content of femur (-26 %) as well as bone collagen content (-56 %). Bone strength and its biomechanical properties given by flexural strength (-81 %), fracture load (-80 %), and the number of osteocytes (-84 %) were lowered after GIO. GCs reduced osteoblast number and function while increased osteoclast number, altering bone remodeling (p < 0.05). On the other hand, ExK significantly improved bone microarchitecture and quality, marked by fractal dimension increase (+38 %), cortical volume (+34 %), BV/TV (+34 %), Tb.Th (+33 %), mineral content and collagen maturity, while reduced the space between trabecula (-34 %). The Ex and ExK increased the number of osteocytes (p < 0.05) and they were able to reverse the lower osteoblast number. Both treatments used alone significantly enhanced bone biomechanical properties, but the ExK showed a more significant improvement. ExK ameliorated bone strength and biomechanics (p < 0.05) and stimulated bone formation and modulated bone remodeling (p < 0.05). MK and exercise administered isolated or in association increased the percentage of collagen bone filling after GIO (p < 0.05), but only ExK improved collagen maturity. Our results showed that MK associated to resistance exercise enhanced bone microarchitecture, quality and metabolism, being therefore an interesting tool to improve skeletal response during GIO.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Kefir, a traditional, fermented-milk beverage, has increasingly been promoted for various health benefits. The evidence from systematic reviews, however, is limited. OBJECTIVE: Evidence from randomized controlled trials testing oral consumption of fermented-milk kefir on any outcome of human health or disease. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Cochrane Trials) from inception to July 31, 2021, was conducted. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were conducted by 2 reviewers independently. DATA ANALYSIS: A total of 18 publications reporting the results of 16 studies were included. Per the narrative analysis, fermented-milk kefir may have potential as a complementary therapy in reducing oral Streptococcus mutans, thereby reducing dental caries risk, and in Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. Kefir may further aid treatment of adult dyslipidemia and hypertension, although evidence was very limited. Safety was only assessed in 5 of the 18 included publications, and 12 of the studies had an overall high risk for bias. CONCLUSION: Kefir is a dairy product with a unique microbiological profile that appears to be a safe for generally healthy populations to consume. However, efficacy and safety data from high-quality human trials are essential before any recommendations may be made for conditions of the oral and gastric microbiota and metabolic health.

      "abstract": "The effect of dietary Kefir supplementation on the biometric, biochemical, and histological parameters of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) exposed to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1, 200 µg/kg diet) contamination was studied. The yeasts were dominant in Kefir followed by lactic and acetic acid bacteria. The Kefir showed relatively interesting antioxidant potential in the DPPH• (IC50 = 0.9 ± 0.02 mg/ml) and ABTS•+ (IC50 = 2.2 ± 0.03 mg/ml) scavenging activities, Fe3+-reducing power (EC0.5 = 1.2 ± 0.01 mg/ml), and β-carotene bleaching assay (IC50 = 3.3 ± 0.02 mg/ml). Three hundred and sixty Nile tilapia weighing 23 ± 5 g were divided into four groups (30 fish/group with 3 replicates), and fed with diets containing Kefir (D2), AFB1 (D3), and Kefir+AFB1 (D4) for 4 weeks, whereas D1 was kept as control group where fish were fed with basal diet. The Kefir supplementation in D4 group significantly increased (p < .05) the percent weight gain as compared to D3 group. Moreover, Kefir improved the antioxidant enzymes in the liver, such as catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, that significantly increased (p < .05) by 2-, 3-, and 1.5-folds, respectively, as compared to D3 group. The Kefir treatment significantly decreased (p < .05) the liver malonaldehyde content by ~50% as compared to D3 group. Histopathological analysis revealed the hepatoprotective effects of Kefir by showing normal liver histological architecture in D4 group, as compared to degenerative changes observed in D3 group. These results suggest that Kefir could be considered as a potential probiotic in Nile tilapia feed to mitigate the AFB1 harmful effects."

      "abstract": "Ochratoxin A (OTA) is reported to cause intestinal damage following ingestion of contaminated foods. Tibetan kefir (TK) is a fermented dairy product that possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiota-regulating properties. However, it is not clear if TK can alleviate OTA-associated intestinal toxicity. Here, we investigated whether TK can prevent OTA-induced intestinal barrier disruption in mice. To this end, OTA-fed mice were treated with sterile water (control) or TK by oral gavage once daily, for 3 weeks. The histological changes of ceca, the expression of tight junction proteins and mucins, and the levels of oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and gut microbiota were then assessed. Results revealed that treatment with TK reversed OTA-driven histopathological changes in the ceca, and was associated with increased cecal mucin levels. TK administration to OTA-treated mice significantly elevated the expression levels of tight junction proteins (claudin-1, zonula occludens-1, and occludin). Additionally, TK supplementation suppressed OTA-induced oxidative stress and reduced inflammation via the NF-κB signaling pathway in the ceca. Moreover, TK supplementation depleted harmful bacteria (e.g., Turicibacter and Desulfovibrio), while supporting short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Blautia, and Ruminococcus), which maintained the SCFAs levels. Taken together, our findings indicate that TK may emerge as a viable dietary strategy to prevent intestinal toxicity-based injuries.",

Different hypotheses explain AD's mechanism, such as the amyloidogenic hypothesis. Moreover, this disease is multifactorial, and several studies have shown that gut dysbiosis and oxidative stress influence its pathogenesis. Knowing that kefir is a probiotic used in therapies to restore dysbiosis and that the bioactive peptides present in it have antioxidant properties, we explored its biotechnological potential as a source of molecules capable of modulating the amyloidogenic pathway and reducing oxidative stress, contributing to the treatment of AD. For that, we used Drosophila melanogaster model for AD (AD-like flies). Identification of bioactive peptides in the kefir sample was made by proteomic and peptidomic analyses, followed by in vitro evaluation of antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibition potential. Flies were treated and their motor performance, brain morphology, and oxidative stress evaluated. Finally, we performed molecular docking between the peptides found and the main pathology-related proteins in the flies. The results showed that the fraction with the higher peptide concentration was positive for the parameters evaluated. In conclusion, these results revealed these kefir peptide-rich fractions have therapeutic potential for AD.",

Azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) were used to establish a mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC). The treatment group mice were administered with LK, SC, or the combination of LK and SC for five days per week from the day of receiving AOM. The composition of the gut microbiota was assessed using internal transcribed spacer 2 and 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, the biomarkers associated with gut barrier integrity, inflammation, regulators of cell proliferation, and apoptosis were evaluated. The results showed that the administration of LK, SC, and their combination increased the body weights and decreased the disease activity index (DAI) score and tumor multiplicity. As compared to the CRC model group, the three treatment groups positively regulated the gut microbiota. Meanwhile, the three treatments also enhanced the gut barrier, decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and oncocyte proliferation indicators, and increased the expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive tumor epithelial cells and content of short chain fatty acids in fecal samples. All these results indicated that the LK and SC alleviated the inflammation and colorectal carcinogenesis in AOM/DSS-induced CRC mouse models, and the majority of tested indexes in the combination group were superior to single strain groups.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decades, an increase of male infertility through the decrease of sperm count has been noted. It has been suggested that environmental factors and lifestyle could a negative impact over sperm quality. Among these factors, the consumption of foods high in fat, which leads to overweight and obesity, can negatively influence fertility. The present study was designed to highlight the protective effect of Kefir, natural probiotic, against the decline in sperm quality related to fat high diet. Thirty adult rats were divided into four groups: Control (1 ml/100 g of body weight (bw) of semi-shimmed cow milk), KM (1 ml/100 g bw of Kefir milk), HFD (1 ml/100 g bw of semi-shimmed cow milk + high-fat diet) and KM/HFD (1 ml/100 g bw Kefir milk + high-fat diet). After 60 days of treatment, sperm quality, biochemical assays of lipids profil, blood cell count and histological examination in testis were assessed. The results described an improved of sperm density (64.28 106  ml vs 54.14 106  ml), viability (70.50% vs 55.33%), mobility (65.40% vs 63.60%) and morphological abnormalities (52% vs 25%) in the KM/HFD group compared to HFD group. In the same group, the lipid profil (Triglycerides (128.39 mg/dl vs 102.85 mg/dl), C-LDL (13.65 mg/dl vs 15.32 mg/dl) and C-HDL (23.21 mg/dl vs 19.15 mg/dl)) was corrected compared to HFD group. The histological observation of testis revealed a normal spermatogenesis compared to seminiferous tubules of HFD group, which showed a serious disruption and damage of testicular epithelium exerted by the high-fat diet. These findings corroborated the previous beneficial effect of Kefir and brought new insights into its beneficial effect against deteriorated spermatogenesis in obese adult rats.",

Simvastatin is a potent lipid-lowering statin that can be utilized for pharmacological therapy in obesity. This study aimed to determine the effect of goat milk kefir supplemented with porang glucomannan (synbiotic kefir) and goat milk kefir without glucomannan (probiotic kefir) on blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), free fatty acids (FFAs), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg), and insulin-producing cells in rats fed a high-fat and high-fructose (HFHF) diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five dietary groups: (1) Normal control, (2) rats fed HFHF, (3) rats fed HFHF+probiotic kefir, (4) rats fed HFHF+synbiotic kefir, and (5) rats fed HFHF+simvastatin. All of these treatments were administered for 4 weeks. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in plasma glucose levels in HFHF diet-fed rats before and after treatment. However, plasma HbA1c and TNF-α decreased, and FFAs were inhibited in rats after treatment with synbiotic kefir. Synbiotic kefir decreased the gene expression of PPARγ2 in HFHF diet-fed rats but did not affect the total number of islets of Langerhans and insulin-producing cells. CONCLUSION: Synbiotic kefir improved the health of rats fed an HFHF diet by decreasing HbA1c, TNF-α, and PPARγ2 gene expression and preventing an increase in FFAs."

      "abstract": "Tibetan kefir grain as the starter of milk fermentation has been applied as functional food with many bioactive characteristics. In this study, the milk whey product (TKG-MW) was obtained through the milk fermentation of Tibetan kefir grain containing the dominant Lactobacillus, Acetobacter, and Bacillus after 3 and 6 days of cultivation. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and melanogenesis inhibition capacities under TKG-MW treatment were analyzed. Results revealed that the antioxidation of TKG-MW at 6 days of fermentation was higher than that at 3 days of fermentation according to the DPPH and ABTS+ radical scavenging analysis. However, the anti-inflammation of TKG-MW was only observed at 6 days of fermentation by using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. The inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase activity by TKG-MW was demonstrated. The decrease of melanin content was verified using α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-stimulated B16-F10 cell. The real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction result indicated that the mRNA levels of Tyr, Trp-1, and Trp-2 of the B16 cell involved in melanin synthesis were down-regulated over a two-fold change by the TKG-MW treatment. Additionally, the protein expressions of Tyr, Trp-1, Trp-2, and Mitf of the B16 cell were reduced with the TKG-MW treatment. Organic acids, such as lactic acid, succinic acid, 3-phenyllactic acid, l-pyroglutamic acid, and malic acid, were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in TKG-MW and were found to significantly inhibit tyrosinase activity. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to report melanogenesis suppression by TKG-MW. Results suggested that the fermentation product of TKG could be applied as a depigmenting agent in food and cosmetics.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a clinically prevalent comorbidity in patients with hemophilia. A preventive effect of kefir peptides (KPs) on postmenopausal osteoporosis has been proved. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of KPs for the treatment of osteoporosis in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) gene knockout mice (F8KO), a model of hemophilia A. In this study, male F8KO mice at 20 weeks of age were orally administered different doses of KPs for 8 weeks. The therapeutic effects of KPs were shown in the femoral trabeculae and the 4th lumbar vertebrae, which increased the trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume (Tb.BV/TV), and trabecular number (Tb.N) and decreased the trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), and they were also observed in the femoral cortical bones, in which the mechanical properties were enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. Characterization of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) demonstrated that the serum RANKL/OPG ratio and IL-6 levels were significantly decreased in the F8KO mice after the KP treatment. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining of mature osteoclasts indicated that the therapeutic effect of KPs in F8KO mice was associated with the functions of KPs to inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by reducing serum RANKL/OPG ratio and IL-6 secretion. The present study is the first to address the potentials of KPs for the treatment of hemophilia-induced osteoporosis in mice and it also provides useful information for the application of KPs as a complementary therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis in hemophilic patients."

In smooth muscle cells (SMCs), the Kef-1 peptide decreased ROS production through the reduced participation of NADPH oxidase and mitochondria. The aorta of 2K1C mice treated with Kef-1 showed lesser wall-thickening and partial restoration of the endothelial structure. In conclusion, these novel findings highlight the in vivo biological potential of this peptide demonstrating that Kef-1 may be a relevant nutraceutical treatment for cardiovascular diseases.",

Kefir may have health beneficial effects, but its mechanism of action remains mostly unclear. Herein, we investigated the impact of dietary high fructose on tight junction proteins and mitogenic pathways in rat testis as well as their modulation by kefir supplementation. Twenty-two male Wistar rats (4 weeks old) were divided into the following three groups: Control; Fructose; Fructose + Kefir. Fructose was added to drinking water at concentration of 20% and administered to the rats for 15 weeks and kefir was supplemented by gavage once a day during final 6 weeks. Dietary fructose-induced testicular degeneration was associated with the downregulation of the blood-testis barrier proteins, claudin-11 and N-cadherin as well as SIRT1 expression in testicular tissue of rats. However, p38MAPK, p-p38MAPK and p-ERK1/2 levels were increased in testis of fructose-fed rats. Interestingly, JNK1 and p-JNK1 protein levels were decreased following this dietary intervention. Raf1, ERK1/2, and caspase 3 and TUNEL staining of the testis reveal the activation of apoptosis due to fructose intake. Kefir supplementation markedly promoted the expression of claudin-11, SIRT1, JNK1 and p-JNK1 but suppressed testicular mitogenic and apoptotic factors in fructose-fed rats.",

      "abstract": "Diet has a fundamental role in the homeostasis of bodily functions, including the skin, which, as an essential protective barrier, plays a crucial role in this balance. The skin and intestine appear to share a series of indirect metabolic pathways, in a dual relationship known as the \"gut-skin axis\". Hence, the gut-skin axis might be receptive to modulation via dietary modification, where probiotics can be included, thus representing a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), in order to control and/or ameliorate symptoms. Kefir is one of the most ancient fermented foods, with probiotic characteristics that have been associated with a wide variety of health-promoting benefits, and it presents a microbiological diversity that makes its application as a probiotic in the gut-skin relationship of the utmost interest. However, the impact of a diet containing kefir on skin health has yet to be reported in scientific literature. This study aimed to assess the impact of the intake of homemade kefir in the skin of healthy and atopic volunteers. The intervention resulted in a boost on barrier function in both skin types verified only in the respective kefir intake groups. An improvement in the degree of severity of AD was also confirmed for the kefir intake group. Atopic individuals may benefit from kefir intake, especially in regard to their skin hydration. Finally, the effects observed on skin barrier function in this study probably culminate from the effects of all the ingredients in kefir, including the complex microbiota, its metabolites and macro- and micronutrients resulting from the fermentation. This work opens the way for more advanced research on the impact of the probiotic kefir on cutaneous health, further clarifying its mechanism of action namely via gut-skin axis."

Kefir is fermented milk resulting from the metabolism of a complex microbiota in symbiosis. Recent researches have investigated the bioactive compounds responsible for the preventive and therapeutic effects attributed to kefir. However, differences in functional potential between industrial and artisanal kefir are still controversial. Firstly, we identified differences in the microbial composition among both types of kefir. Available evidence concerning the action of different bioactive compounds from kefir on health, both from in vitro and in vivo studies, was subsequently summarized to draw a primary conclusion of the dose and the intervention time for effect, the producer microorganisms, the precursor in the milk, and the action mechanism. Meta-analysis was performed to investigate the statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between intervention and control and between both types of kefir for each health effect studied. In summary, the bioactive compounds more commonly reported were exopolysaccharides, including kefiran, bioactive peptides, and organic acids, especially lactic acid. Kefir bioactive compounds presented antimicrobial, anticancer, and immune-modulatory activities corroborated by the meta-analysis. However, clinical evidence is urgently needed to strengthen the practical applicability of these bioactive compounds. The mechanisms of their action were diverse, indicating that they can act by different signaling pathways. Still, industrial and artisanal kefir may differ regarding functional potential-OR of 8.56 (95% CI: 2.27-32.21, P ≤ .001)-according to the observed health effect, which can be associated with differences in the microbial composition between both types of kefir.",

Furthermore, the biomarkers associated with the gut barrier, inflammation, and cell proliferation regulators were evaluated. The results indicated that the size and the amount of tumor were decreased and the immunity regulators (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17a) and oncocyte proliferation indicator (Ki67, NF-κB, and β-catenin) were all decreased. Increased short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) lowered the pH in the colon and helped enhance the intestinal barrier. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and Ascomycota/Basidiomycota ratio were decreased at the phylum level; the relative abundance of probiotics was increased and the pathogenic bacterium (Clostridium sensu stricto, Aspergillus and Talaromyces) were decreased after supplementation of kefir.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, Control, Kefir, HFCS, and HFCS plus Kefir groups were formed; kefir was given by gastric gavage, while HFCS (20% beverages) was given in drinking water; for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Based on morphological evaluations, immunohistochemical, and gene expression results, it was clearly determined that excess dose of HFCS consumption decreased osteoblastic activity in craniomandibular bones while increasing osteoclastic activity. However, it has been determined that the intake of kefir with the HFCS-feeding greatly suppresses the effects of HFCS on bone tissues. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, dietary the excess dose of HFCS at an early age has been observed to pose a risk for cranial and mandible bone development. The healing effects of kefir may be a new approach to the treatment via kefir consumption in young's.",

METHODS: All participants were enrolled in a structured exercise training program and separated into kefir (KEF) or control (CON) treatment groups. KEF consumed 8 oz. of kefir after exercise sessions (3 d·wk-1) for 12 wk. Outcome measures included assessments for body size and composition, aerobic fitness and muscular strength, medical history, and psychological state at pre- and postintervention time points. Blood was collected and analyzed for C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations, and LPS-stimulated whole blood IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α production were obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at both time points. Monocyte numbers and phenotype were obtained using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Participants (N = 24; 9 males and 15 females) were an average of 61 ± 9.9 yr old. Kefir consumption was associated with 6.3% (P = 0.034) improvements in lean body mass, as well as 51.4% (P = 0.046), 39.3% (P = 0.017), and 64.7% (P = 0.021) improvements in measures of depression, fatigue, and gastric distress, respectively. KEF also experienced a significant 35.4% (P = 0.01) reduction in circulating LPS along with an 18.0% increase (P < 0.001) in classical monocytes % and a 22.3% decrease (P = 0.04) in nonclassical monocytes %. There were no significant changes in any other variables. CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of kefir consumption improved lean body mass, depression, fatigue, gastric distress, and a biomarker of gut dysbiosis. Kefir improved overall and classical monocyte numbers. Kefir should be considered as a component of a postexercise dietary regimen for cancer survivors.",

CASE REPORT: The patient is a young man under pharmacotherapy for epilepsy, exhibiting classical abnormal movements, which are consider typical hallmarks of RE. During clinical care sessions, he presented many episodes of tonic-clonic seizures involving sudden loss of consciousness followed by a post-ictal phase with weakness and interaction difficulty. During the kefir supplementation, the patient presented only short-term absence seizures, quickly returning to activities. Additionally, he presented cognitive and language improvement, being more responsive to commands. The daily diary control of patient's mother and caregiver at school reported an impressive reduction in number and severity of seizures, becoming less aggressive and more involved in school activities. The serum biochemical markers showed that kefir administration caused a significant decrease of pro-inflammatory and a simultaneous increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. In parallel, after treatment, this probiotic reduced reactive oxygen species levels, increased NO bioavailability, revealing antiapoptotic and antigenotoxic effects. Regarding the microbiological analysis, kefir increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting remarkable beneficial effects of the probiotic kefir in RE. This case report strongly suggests kefir supplementation as a potential and safe-effective adjuvant therapeutic strategy in the control and treatment of RE.",

Remarkably, alteration in the gut microbiome and resultant insulin resistance has been shown to be connected to metabolic syndrome, the crucial risk factor for AD, and also to be implicated in AD pathogenesis. Thus, this study, we assessed the efficiency of probiotics fermentation technology (PFT), a kefir product, in enhancing insulin signaling via modulation of gut microbiota to halt the development of AD. We also compared its effectiveness to that of pioglitazone, an insulin sensitizer that has been confirmed to substantially treat AD. AD was induced in mice by a single injection of intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ; 3 mg/kg). PFT (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) and pioglitazone (30 mg/kg) were administered orally for 3 weeks. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess cognitive function, and hippocampal levels of acetylcholine (Ach) and β-amyloid (Aβ1-42) protein were assessed along with histological examination. Moreover, the expression of the insulin receptor, insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), and the phosphorylated forms of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and tau were detected. Furthermore, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers were estimated. Treatment with PFT reversed STZ-induced neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment, enhanced hippocampal Ach levels, and reduced Aβ1-42 levels after restoration of IDE activity. PFT also improved insulin signaling, as evidenced by upregulation of insulin receptor expression and activation of PI3K/Akt signaling with subsequent suppression of GSK-3β and mTOR signaling, which result in the downregulation of hyperphosphorylated tau. Moreover, PFT significantly diminished oxidative stress and inflammation induced by STZ. These potential effects were parallel to those produced by pioglitazone. Therefore, PFT targets multiple mechanisms incorporated in the pathogenesis of AD and hence might be a beneficial therapy for AD."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty school children with initial carious lesions in the age group of 8-12 years were selected and divided into four groups. Children in group I (control) were undergone with restorations without supplementation of probiotics. Children in group II (kefir milk), group III (probiotic curd), and group IV (probiotic drink) supplemented 100 mL of their respective probiotics for 1 month. Assessment of saliva sample was done at baseline, 1 hour after administration of probiotics followed by weekly intervals till 1 month. RESULTS: The study showed a marked reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs) at a 1-hour time interval in all four groups when compared to baseline. On the 30th-day, children in group II and group III have shown an equal reduction of CFUs when compared to group IV and group I. CONCLUSION: Probiotic products like kefir milk and probiotic curd have shown an equal and marked decrease in CFUs when compared to the probiotic drink group. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The administration of probiotics along with dairy products can be used as an adjuvant to routine preventive treatment procedures in the prevention of dental caries along with the remineralization of the demineralized tooth structure.

      "abstract": "Kefir is a fermented beverage obtained as a result of lactic-alcoholic fermentation of milk by using kefir grains or a starter culture. Kefir beverage has numerous health benefits owing to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties, while it could also regulate the gut microbiota. This beverage is recommended as a nutritional approach to glycemic control. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the effects of kefir beverage on the glycemic control. For this purpose, a literature search was conducted via databases such as PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar for the articles published until July 2020 with no limitation. The indicators of glycemic control were fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and insulin. In total, six RCTs on a total sample size of 323 subjects were selected for the meta-analysis. Inverse-variance weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the mean changes in HbA1c, FBG and insulin compared to baseline. Considering the clinical heterogeneity caused by the varied duration and dosage of kefir beverage treatment, a random effects model was used to estimate the pooled WMD. Findings indicated a more significant reduction in the FBS (WMD = -10.28; 95% CI: -16.53-4.02; P = 0.001) and insulin (WMD = -2.87; 95% CI: -3.96-1.78; P < 0.00001) in the kefir treatment group. Furthermore, kefir consumption could reduce HbA1c (HbA1c = -0.64 -1.36, 0.08), while this effect was not considered significant (-0.64; 95% CI: -1.36-0.08; P = 0.08). The results of our meta-analysis indicated that kefir beverage could reduce the FBS and insulin levels without a significant effect on HbA1c. In general, our findings showed that kefir beverages may have beneficial effects on glycemic control. However, more clinical data and research into the mechanism of probiotics are required to clarify the beneficial effects of probiotics on glycemic markers.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most severe developmental disorders, affecting on average 1 in 150 children worldwide. There is a great need for more effective strategies to improve quality of life in ASD subjects. The gut microbiome has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in ASD. A novel modulator of the gut microbiome, the traditionally fermented milk drink kefir, has recently been shown to modulate the microbiota and decrease repetitive behaviour, one of the hallmarks of ASD, in mice. As such, we hypothesized that kefir could ameliorate behavioural deficits in a mouse model relevant to ASD; the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J mouse strain. To this end, adult mice were administered either kefir (UK4) or a milk control for three weeks as treatment lead-in, after which they were assessed for their behavioural phenotype using a battery of tests. In addition, we assessed systemic immunity by flow cytometry and the gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that indeed kefir decreased repetitive behaviour in this mouse model. Furthermore, kefir prolonged stress-induced increases in corticosterone 60 min post-stress, which was accompanied by an ameliorated innate immune response as measured by LY6Chi monocyte levels. In addition, kefir increased the levels of anti-inflammatory Treg cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). Kefir also increased the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae bacterium A2, which correlated with reduced repetitive behaviour and increased Treg cells in MLNs. Functionally, kefir modulated various predicted gut microbial pathways, including the gut-brain module S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis, as well as L-valine biosynthesis and pyruvate fermentation to isobutanol, which all correlated with repetitive behaviour. Taken together our data show that kefir modulates peripheral immunoregulation, can ameliorate specific ASD behavioural dysfunctions and modulates selective aspects of the composition and function of the gut microbiome, indicating that kefir supplementation might prove a viable strategy in improving quality of life in ASD subjects.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of different types of high-calorie foods leads to the development of various metabolic disorders. However, the effects of multi-strain probiotics on different types of diet-induced obesity and intestinal dysbiosis remain unclear. In this study, mice were fed a control diet, high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat and 20% kcal carbohydrate), or western diet (WD; 40% kcal fat and 43% kcal carbohydrate) and administered with multi-strain AB-Kefir containing six strains of lactic acid bacteria and a Bifidobacterium strain, at 109 CFU per mouse for 10 weeks. Results demonstrated that AB-Kefir reduced body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis with a minor influence on gut microbiota composition in HFD-fed mice, but not in WD-fed mice. In addition, AB-Kefir significantly reduced the weight and size of adipose tissues by regulating the expression of CD36, Igf1, and Pgc1 in HFD-fed mice. Although AB-Kefir did not reduce the volume of white adipose tissue, it markedly regulated CD36, Dgat1 and Mogat1 mRNA expression. Moreover, the abundance of Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group and Ruminiclostridium significantly correlated with changes in body weight, liver weight, and fasting glucose in test mice. Overall, this study provides important evidence to understand the interactions between probiotics, gut microbiota, and diet in obesity treatment.",

Here, the antioxidant potentials of the six different kefir water samples were analysed by total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) assays, whereas the anti-apoptotic activity on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced SH-SY5Y cells was examined using MTT, AO/PI double staining, and PI/Annexin V-FITC assays. The surface and internal morphological features of SH-SY5Y cells were studied using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that Kefir B showed the higher TPC (1.96 ± 0.54 µg GAE/µL), TFC (1.09 ± 0.02 µg CAT eq/µL), FRAP (19.68 ± 0.11 mM FRAP eq/50 µL), and DPPH (0.45 ± 0.06 mg/mL) activities compared to the other kefir samples. The MTT and PI/Annexin V-FITC assays showed that Kefir B pre-treatment at 10 mg/mL for 48 h resulted in greater cytoprotection (97.04%), and a significantly lower percentage of necrotic cells (7.79%), respectively. The Kefir B pre-treatment also resulted in greater protection to cytoplasmic and cytoskeleton inclusion, along with the conservation of the surface morphological features and the overall integrity of SH-SY5Y cells. Our findings indicate that the anti-oxidative, anti-apoptosis, and neuroprotective effects of kefir were mediated via the upregulation of SOD and catalase, as well as the modulation of apoptotic genes (Tp73, Bax, and Bcl-2)."

An obesity model was established by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) to human-microbiota-associated rats. Next-generation sequencing and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry were applied for gut microbiota and untargeted metabolomics, respectively. After 8 weeks of feeding, the enterotype in the HFD group was switched from ET1 (Prevotella/Akkermansia-dominant) to ET2 (Bacteroides/Akkermansia-dominant). Branched-chain amino-acids- and aromatic amino-acids-metabolism increased, and taurine-conjugated bile acids decreased in the HFD group. Compared with the HFD group, taurocholic acid increased in the TKM1 group, while l-threonine decreased, and equol, taurochenodeoxycholate, and taurodeoxycholic acid increased in the TKM2 group. The metabolite alteration suggested restorative bile acid metabolism, modified metabolic pattern of amino acids, and elevation of anti-obesity factors in the TKM-intervened animals. It can be deduced that changes by TKM intervention in the host gut metabolites are the major contributors to reducing fat deposition.",

It is traditionally characterized by amyloidogenic pathway formation of senile plaques, and recent studies indicate that dysbiosis is also an important factor in AD's pathology. To overcome dysbiosis, probiotics-as kefir-have shown to be a great therapeutic alternative for Alzheimer's disease. In this present work, we explored kefir as a probiotic and a metabolite source as a modulator of microbiome and amyloidogenic pathway, using a Drosophila melanogaster model for AD (AD-like flies). Kefir microbiota composition was determined through 16S rRNA sequencing, and the metabolome of each fraction (hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol) was investigated. After treatment, flies had their survival, climbing ability, and vacuolar lesions accessed. Kefir and fraction treated flies improved their climbing ability survival rate and neurodegeneration index. In conclusion, we show that kefir in natura, as well as its fractions may be promising therapeutic source against AD, modulating amyloidogenic related pathways.",

      "abstract": "Excess intake of fructose may contribute to the high prevalence of metabolic disorder. In this study, we investigated the effects of kefir supplementation on the intestine-liver-adipose tissue axis in metabolic disorder induced by high-fructose diet in rats to describe mechanistic action and potential therapeutic value of kefir. Fructose was given to the rats as a 20% solution in drinking water for 15 weeks. Kefir was administrated by gastric gavage once a day during the final six weeks. Kefir supplementation improved metabolic parameters, including plasma triglyceride and insulin levels; hepatic weight, triglyceride content and fatty degeneration; omental fat mass in fructose-fed rats. Kefir supplementation decreased the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in feces, as well as necrotic degeneration, expression levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but increased expression of tight-junction proteins occludin and claudin-1, in the ileum of the fructose-fed rats. Kefir treatment also reduced the mRNA levels of key lipogenic genes sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) together with a decline in expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), NF-κB, and glycosylated glycoprotein (CD68) in the liver. Moreover, kefir treatment improved insulin signaling at the level of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (peNOS) as well as fructose transporters (GLUT2 and GLUT5) in the liver, but not in the adipose tissue, of high-fructose-fed rats. Consequently, kefir supplementation suppresses hepatic lipogenesis and inflammatory status, but promotes insulin signaling, in association with a change of the fecal microbiota and attenuation of the intestinal permeability factors in high-fructose-fed rats. Thus, we propose that kefir has favorable effects on the hepatic and intestinal irregularities induced by fructose overconsumption.",

The increase in the consumption of healthy foods has consequently led to an increased demand for functional foods with specific health benefits. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry's interest in natural products has grown every time and is therefore considered as an alternative to synthetic drugs. Kefir has been outstanding for several years as promising in the manufacture of various pharmaceutical products, due to its nutritional and therapeutic properties for the treatment of many diseases. Currently, a wide variety of new functional foods are appearing on the market, representing an important segment. Postbiotics, for example, has stood out for being a product with action similar to probiotics, without offering side effects. The kefiran is the postbiotic from kefir that promotes potential beneficial effects on food allergy from the intestinal microbiome to the immune system. In this context, it is necessary to know the main promoting component of this functional effect. This review compiles the benefits that kefir, and especially its postbiotic, kefiran, can bring to food allergy. In addition, it serve as a subsidy for studies on the development of innovative nutraceutical products, including the use of kefiran as an alternative therapy in food allergy.",

This study evaluated the anti-inflammatory and antiresorptive effects of milk kefir (MK) on periodontitis in rats. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was performed on MK at different fermentation times to verify the presence of Lactobacillus kefiri. From these results, Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: C (Control); EP (experimental periodontitis); K1 (animals that received MK with one day of fermentation); K1+EP; K4 (animals without EP using MK with four days of fermentation) and K4+EP. MK was administered 28 days before EP induction and during the disease development period (11 days). On day 28, in the EP groups, periodontitis was induced. The animals were euthanized on day 39. The hemimaxillae were removed and the following parameters were evaluated: micro-Raman analysis of the presence of inflammation; histomorphometric analysis to quantify alveolar bone loss and immunohistochemistry for IL-6, TNF-α, IL-Iβ and IL-10 in the periodontal ligament. Micro-Raman analysis showed that four days fermentation MK has a higher intensity spectrum of L. kefiri. Furthermore, the administration of this probiotic reduced the intensity of the inflammation spectrum when compared to one day fermentation MK. It was observed that the animals from the K4+EP group showed significant reduction of alveolar bone loss, as well as a lower IL-6, TNF-α and IL-Iβ immunoexpression and a higher IL-10 immunoexpression, when compared to EP groups. We conclude that MK has anti-inflammatory and antiresorptive effects on periodontitis in rats and that these effects are fermentation time dependent.",

Several therapies are focused on activated T cells as key targets. Although Lactobacillus kefiri has shown anti-inflammatory effects in animal models, few studies were done using human mucosal T cells. The aim of this work was to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of this bacterium on intestinal T cells from patients with active IBD. Mucosal biopsies and surgical samples from IBD adult patients (n = 19) or healthy donors (HC; n = 5) were used. Lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated by enzymatic tissue digestion, and entero-adhesive Escherichia coli-specific lamina propria T cells (LPTC) were expanded. The immunomodulatory properties of L. kefiri CIDCA 8348 strain were evaluated on biopsies and on anti-CD3/CD28-activated LPTC. Secreted cytokines were quantified by ELISA, and cell proliferation and viability were assessed by flow cytometry. We found that L. kefiri reduced spontaneous release of IL-6 and IL-8 from inflamed biopsies ex vivo. Activated LPTC from IBD patients showed low proliferative rates and reduced secretion of TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ and IL-13 in the presence of L. kefiri. In addition, L. kefiri induced an increased frequency of CD4+FOXP3+ LPTC along with high levels of IL-10. This is the first report showing an immunomodulatory effect of L. kefiri CIDCA 8348 on human intestinal cells from IBD patients. Understanding the mechanisms of interaction between probiotics and immune mucosal cells may open new avenues for treatment and prevention of IBD."

      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate whether high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) intake (20% beverages) impacts antioxidative structures and inflammation in the gingival tissue and masseter muscle of rats. Kefir was tested for its potential utility on changes induced by HFCS. Animals were randomly divided into four groups as control, kefir, HFCS, and HFCS plus kefir. HFCS was given as 20% solutions in drinking water while kefir supplementations were given by gastric gavage for 8 weeks. It has been clearly determined that the HFCS diet increased expressions of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α proinflammatory structures via lymphocyte infiltration by suppressing antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in both tissues. Kefir improved these undesirable changes in rats fed with HFCS. The results of this current study, the first investigation to examine the effects of kefir on masseter muscle and gingival tissue, may provide new access to the restorative effects of kefir consumption on oral health disorders caused by high fructose in the diet. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this study, at an early age, the effects of kefir on improving inflammation via antioxidation in the masseter muscle and gingival tissue were investigated for the first time. We showed that kefir feeding ameliorates lymphocyte infiltration on the high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)-induced masseter muscle and gingival tissue inflammation in rats. The mRNA expressions of inflammatory parameters measured in the study were supported by protein measurements via ELISA or immunohistochemistry. In the present study, kefir may play an important role in the antioxidation and inflammation process on the masseter muscle and gingival tissue against HFCS.",

      "abstract": "The adverse health effects of benzene occupational and circumstance pollution exposure are an increasing concern. It leads to damage to various human tissues including bone marrow and ovarian tissues and many vital physiological processes. Previous studies showed that kefir is a rich probiotic, having protective effect, thanks to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory capacity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy of kefir to remediate benzene toxicity in rat. Thirty-two female rats were randomly allocated and administered orally with benzene and/or kefir during a period of 21 consecutive days. At the end of the experiment, hematological and bone marrow cell changes were estimated. The animals exposed to benzene exhibited anemia and a significant decrease in the levels of white blood cell. Moreover, benzene led to the activation of gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), a myelotoxicity in bone marrow cells. Our data showed that kefir treatment alleviated benzene-associated weight loss and increased the number of whole blood cells in peripheral blood and nucleated cells in the bone marrow. Furthermore, these physiological results were observed with animals showing high concentrations of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) determined from fecal samples, which are considered an indicator of kefir-associated microorganisms. Our study suggests that kefir is a potential nutritional supplement target to attenuate hematotoxicity induced by benzene.",

      "abstract": "In the last decades changes in the pattern of health and disease in Latin America and in the world has been observed, with an increase in cases of chronic non-communicable diseases. Changes in intestinal microbiota composition can contribute to the development of these diseases and be useful in their management. In this context, the consumption of fermented foods with probiotic properties, such as kefir, stands out due to its gut microbiota-modulating capacity. There is an increasing interest in the commercial use of kefir since it can be marketed as a natural beverage containing health-promoting bacteria and has been gaining international popularity in Latin America. Also the consumption of these drinks in Latin America seems to be even more relevant, given the socioeconomic situation of this population, which highlights the need for disease prevention at the expense of its treatment. In this narrative review, we discuss how kefir may work against obesity, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, cardiovascular disorders, immunity, and neurological disorders. Peptides, bioactive compounds and strains occurring in kefir, can modulate gut microbiota composition, low-grade inflammation and intestinal permeability, which consequently may generate health benefits. Kefir can also impact on the regulation of organism homeostasis, with a direct effect on the gut-brain axis, being a possible strategy for the prevention of metabolic diseases. Further studies are needed to standardize these bioactive compounds and better elucidate the mechanisms linking kefir and intestinal microbiota modulation. However, due to the benefits reported, low cost and ease of preparation, kefir seems to be a promising approach to prevent and manage microbiota-related diseases in Latin America and the rest of the world."

Kefir yeast was grown in the cell culture supplemented with juglone and resveratrol (1:2). After 48 h incubation, JRK solution was applied (0.1 mL/day i.p.) to the EAC-bearing mice throughout five days. Molecular regulatory mechanisms of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathway components were evaluated in the plasma of mice and isolated EAC cells with ELISA, qRT-PCR, and immunocytchemical experiments. EAC-induced upregulation in Bcl-2 and downregulation in Caspase-3 were normalized with JRK in the plasma of mice. Additionally, JRK upregulated the expression levels of apoptotic Bax, p53, Caspase-3,8,9, and APAF-1 proteins together with BAX, CASPASE-8, and CASPASE-9 genes in isolated EAC cells. These changes were also associated with decreased expression levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl proteins. Immunocytochemical studies also confirmed the activation of apoptotic pathways and repression of anti-apoptotic proteins in EAC cells with JRK treatment. JRK activates apoptotic pathway and inhibits anti-apoptotic genes and proteins in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma- bearing BALB/c mice that could be beneficial in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Kefir is an acidic, carbonated, and fermented dairy product produced by fermenting milk with kefir grains. The Lactobacillus species constitutes an important part of kefir grains. In a previous animal study, kefir effectively improved exercise performance and had anti-fatigue effects. The purpose of this research was to explore the benefits of applying kefir to improve exercise performance, reduce fatigue, and improve physiological adaptability in humans. The test used a double-blind crossover design and supplementation for 28 days. Sixteen 20-30 year-old subjects were divided into two groups in a balanced order according to each individual's initial maximal oxygen uptake and were assigned to receive a placebo (equal flavor, equal calories, 20 g/day) or SYNKEFIR™ (20 g/day) every morning. After the intervention, there were 28 days of wash-out, during which time the subjects did not receive further interventions. After supplementation with SYNKEFIR™, the exercise time to exhaustion was significantly greater than that before ingestion (p = 0.0001) and higher than that in the Placebo group by 1.29-fold (p = 0.0004). In addition, compared with the Placebo group, the SYNKEFIR™ administration group had significantly lower lactate levels in the exercise and recovery (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in the changes in the gut microbiota. Although no significant changes in body composition were found, SYNKEFIR™ did not cause adverse reactions or harm to the participants' bodies. In summary, 28 days of supplementation with SYNKEFIR™ significantly improved exercise performance, reduced the production of lactic acid after exercise, and accelerated recovery while also not causing any adverse reactions."

Numerous investigation have been accomplished in the field of the therapeutic property of probiotic products. In the present study, we assessed the cytotoxic effect of kefir on the rate of growth and increase of glioblastoma cancer cell as the most severe form of brain tumors. In this experimental study, we used a U87 cancer cell line (glioblastoma). The interaction between cancer cells and different concentrations of kefir drink and supernatants at 24 and 48 hours was considered. The cell cytotoxicity of kefir and sedimentation of cell lysate and extract of kefir was assessed using the MTT test after 24 and 48 hours. The result of the MTT test, treatment of the cells with the 48-hour fermented drink, demonstrated the most cell cytotoxicity in comparison with the control group. Results showed that the toxicity effect in all groups was dose-dependent, and by increasing the concentration, cell survival decreased noticeably. The results indicated that the supernatant of fermented kefir drink as a probiotic product has more toxicity and lethality effect on the glioblastoma cancer cell. This product can be utilized as a replacement or a complementary therapy of cancer."

Human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) Caco-2 were treated with PRCC-1301 EVs and then stimulated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Real-time RT-PCR revealed that PRCC-1301 EVs inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in Caco-2 cells. PRCC-1301 EVs enhanced intestinal barrier function by maintaining intestinal cell integrity and the tight junction. Loss of Zo-1, claudin-1, and occludin in Caco-2 cells and the colitis tissues was recovered after PRCC-1301 EVs treatment, as evidenced by immunofluorescence analysis. Acute murine colitis was induced using 4% DSS and chronic colitis was generated in piroxicam-treated IL-10-/- mice. PRCC-1301 EVs attenuated body weight loss, colon shortening, and histological damage in acute and chronic colitis models in mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that phosphorylated NF-κB p65 and IκBα were reduced in the colon tissue sections treated with PRCC-1301 EVs. Our results suggest that PRCC-1301 EVs may have an anti-inflammatory effect on colitis by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway and improving intestinal barrier function."

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a major skeletal disease associated with estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women. Kefir-fermented peptides (KPs) are bioactive peptides with health-promoting benefits that are produced from the degradation of dairy milk proteins by the probiotic microflora in kefir grains. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of KPs on osteoporosis prevention and the modulation of the composition of the gut microbiota in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. OVX mice receiving an 8-week oral gavage of 100 mg of KPs and 100 mg of KPs + 10 mg Ca exhibited lower trabecular separation (Tb. Sp), and higher bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular number (Tb. N) and bone volume (BV/TV), than OVX groups receiving Ca alone and untreated mice, and these effects were also reflected in bones with better mechanical properties of strength and fracture toughness. The gut microbiota of the cecal contents was examined by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. α-Diversity analysis indicated that the gut microbiota of OVX mice was enriched more than that of sham mice, but the diversity was not changed significantly. Treatment with KPs caused increased microbiota richness and diversity in OVX mice compared with those in sham mice. The microbiota composition changed markedly in OVX mice compared with that in sham mice. Following the oral administration of KPs for 8 weeks, the abundances of Alloprevotella, Anaerostipes, Parasutterella, Romboutsia, Ruminococcus_1 and Streptococcus genera were restored to levels close to those in the sham group. However, the correlation of these bacterial populations with bone metabolism needs further investigation. Taken together, KPs prevent menopausal osteoporosis and mildly modulate the structure of the gut microbiota in OVX mice.",

This study was aimed to identify the probiotic potential of Lactobacillus strains isolated from kefir and evaluate their antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). METHODS: Twelve Lactobacillus strains were evaluated. Antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of Cell Free Supernatant (CFS) of the Lactobacillus strains against UPEC isolates were evaluated by agar well diffusion method and crystal violet assay, respectively. Probiotic potential of selected isolates was assessed by analyzing their tolerance to acidic pH and bile salts, auto-aggregation ability, co-aggregation with Escherichia coli (E. coli) and hemolytic activity. The isolates were identified by phenotypic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: The CFS of all lactobacilli strains was able to inhibit UPEC isolates even after neutralization. Four out of 12 isolates inhibited the biofilm formation by UPEC in the range 62-75%. The viability under acidic condition varied among the isolates ranging from 6-89.8%. All the isolates could tolerate the 0.3% bile and eight isolates showed the adaptation time of less than 1 hr. All the strains exhibited co-aggregation with E. coli. Auto-aggregation was highly correlated with co-aggregation of all lactobacilli strains with E. coli (r=0.889, p<0.001). The isolates with satisfactory probiotic potential and higher ability of biofilm inhibition and antibacterial activity belonged to the species Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus paracasei. CONCLUSION: All four selected probiotic strains exhibited antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities, which suggest potential applications for controlling or preventing infections caused by UPEC."

In the present study, we examine the protective effects of PFT, a novel kefir product, against age-associated oxidative stress using aged (10-month-old) mice. METHODS: Mice were treated with PFT orally at a daily dose of 2 mg/kg body weight over 6 weeks, and antioxidant status, protein oxidation, and lipid peroxidation were studied in the brain, liver, and blood. RESULTS: PFT supplementation significantly reduced the oxidative stress biomarkers malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide; reversed the reductions in glutathione (GSH) levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR) content; enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD); inhibited the liver enzyme levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT); significantly reduced triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels; and significantly elevated high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Interestingly, PFT supplementation reversed the oxidative changes associated with aging, thus bringing levels to within the limits of the young control mice in the brain, liver, and blood. We also note that PFT affects the redox homeostasis of young mice and that it is corrected post-treatment with PFT. CONCLUSION: Our findings show the effectiveness of dietary PFT supplementation in modulating age-associated oxidative stress in mice and motivate further studies of PFT's effects in reducing age-associated disorders where free radicals and oxidative stress are the major cause.",

      "abstract": "The increased prevalence of renal dysfunction and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the high costs and poor outcomes of treatment are a significant health issue. The consequence of chronic high blood pressure is the increased prevalence of target organ end-stage renal disease, which has been proven to be a strong independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular disease. A previous study showed that kefir products have anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive activities and immunological modulation functions. However, no data regarding the beneficial effects of kefir peptides (KPs) on salt-induced renal damage or related kidney diseases are available. In this study, KPs were orally administered to aged salt-induced stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rats, and the effects of KPs against inflammation and oxidative stress and their ability to protect against renal dysfunction were evaluated. Fifty-five-week-old SHRSP rats under induction with 1% NaCl in drinking water for 4 weeks showed multiple renal injuries with increased renal inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress, tubular atrophy, and glomerulosclerosis. In contrast, oral gavage with KPs reduced the urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio, the fractional excretion of electrolytes (FeNa and FeCl), extracellular matrix deposition, and the interstitial fibrotic α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) levels in salt-induced SHRSP rats. The renal infiltration of inflammatory cells; the release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and the cytokine nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β); the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels; and histopathological lesions were also decreased in salt-induced SHRSP rats. Furthermore, KP treatment significantly increased the renal superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which exerted potent protection against salt-induced chronic kidney disease in SHRSP rats. The results of this study suggest that KPs ameliorate salt-induced renal damage, tubular atrophy, and glomerular dysfunction through anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and antifibrotic activities, and might be a promising protective agent against high salt-induced renovascular-related diseases."

Previous studies have suggested that probiotics seem to be a new and promising alternative to vaccinations to protect animals against potential viral infections. In this study, we used the Vero cell culture model of infection to study porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). We screened lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with anti-PEDV potential from kefir grains, which are starter cultures used to ferment milk into kefir. Twenty-nine LAB strains were isolated and identified as Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactococcus lactis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, according to 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and rpoA gene sequence analyses. The anti-PEDV activities of the LAB intracellular extracts were compared, and the intracellular extracts of Ln. mesenteroides showed higher anti-PEDV activities than that of the other species. Among the Ln. mesenteroides strains, a strain designated YPK30 showed a higher growth rate than that of the other strains and was further evaluated for its anti-PEDV activity. The results showed that the intracellular extracts of Ln. mesenteroides YPK30 possessed in vitro prophylactic, therapeutic, and direct-inhibitory effects against PEDV in the Vero cell model. The expression levels of Type 1 interferon (IFN)-dependent genes, including Myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), were significantly increased after treatment with intracellular extracts of Ln. mesenteroides YPK30 for 24 h. Such expression suggests that the anti-PEDV activity of Ln. mesenteroides YPK30 could be attributed to its up-regulatory effect on the expression of MX1 and ISG15 genes. These results suggested that Ln. mesenteroides YPK30 has the potential to provide some levels of host protection against PEDV infections."

Interestingly, the strain was able to remove more than 99% of Pb2+ ions in water at low concentrations and a maximum of 325.68 mg lead/g of dry biomass. The results of selective passivation experiments suggested that phosphate, amide and carboxyl groups on the cell wall contributed to lead removal. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photomicrographs revealed that large amounts of micro/nanoparticles formed on the cell wall, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) results further indicated the presence of lead along with phosphorus and chlorine in the particles. Furthermore, the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed that the particles were composed of pyromorphite [Pb5(PO4)3Cl], a highly insoluble lead mineral. Importantly, this is the first time that the biomineralization of lead into pyromorphite has been observed as the major mechanism for lead removal by G. candidum LG-8, providing a new strategy to scavenge heavy metals from aquatic environment in an eco-friendly manner.",

      "abstract": "Ionizing radiation is a double-edged sword because of its benefits and risks to human health. Therefore, protecting human organs from harmful effects of radiation is an important concern of researchers. Kefir, as a good source of probiotics, received growing interest in protective medicine owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Thus, this study was planned to investigate the protective role of kefir against γ-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. Thirty-two male rats were distributed in four groups: (I) control, (II) received Kefir orally (5 ml/kg body weight) for 28 days, (III) exposed to whole body γ-irradiation (6.5 Gy) to induce hepatotoxicity, and (IV) was pretreated with kefir for 21 days then exposed to γ-irradiation followed by 7 days of kefir treatment. At the end of the experiment, complete blood picture (CBC), liver function, and lipid profile were estimated. Furthermore, levels of lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide content, and endogenous antioxidants, in addition to concentrations of copper, iron, and calcium were measured in liver tissue. Furthermore, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and relative gene expression of nuclear factor kappa (NF-κB) were assessed. The results revealed that oral administration of kefir significantly reduced the radiation-induced hepatic histological alterations, hepatic function impairment, and dyslipidemia. Moreover, kefir notably ameliorated the state of oxidative stress and appeared to inhibit the induced inflammation. This study provides a possible counteracting role of kefir against hepatotoxicity induced γ-radiation. This can focus the benefit of kefir application as a prophylactic treatment to limit hepatic inflammation during radiotherapy.",

In this study, the performance of Tunisian Kefir grains during the biological treatment of a mixture of Gouda cheese whey and white wastewaters (GCW) in ratio 1:1 with very high organic matter concentration is investigated. The biological process was evaluated and optimized through the response surface methodology. Under the optimum conditions, Kefir grains concentration of 1.02%, temperature at 36.68 °C, and incubation time of 5.14 days, the removal efficiencies of COD, PO43-, and NO3- were 87, 37.48, and 39.5%, respectively. Interestingly, the reusability tests of the grains proved not only their high resistance to harsh environmental conditions but also their great potential for more practical applications. Particularly, different strains were isolated from the grains and identified as Kluyveromyces marxianus, Lactoccocus lactis, Lactobacillus kefiri, and Bacillus spp. using 16S rDNA sequence analysis and rep-PCR fingerprinting. At the biological level, the raw GCW (RGCW) has a negative impact on the Hordeum vulgare both on seed germination, and on the growth parameters of seedlings. Interestingly, after Kefir grains treatment, the treated GCW (TGCW) allow a seedlings growth and germination rate similar to those soaked in water.",

Evidence for pathways affected and suggestions of possible mechanisms of action are also considered. RECENT FINDINGS: Human trials examining the ability of kefir to recapitulate metabolic health benefits previously observed in rodent models have found mixed results. Kefir has long been associated with improvements in health including obesity, diabetes, NAFLD, and dyslipidemia in preventative animal trials. While recent evidence from human trials supports a positive role of kefir in modulating diabetes-related markers, the impact of kefir consumption on markers of dyslipidemia, NAFLD, and body composition has been for the most part contradictory to animal findings. Variability in organisms for kefir fermentation poses a significant challenge in making meaningful comparisons. Recommendations for future well-controlled animal and human research are provided.",

      "abstract": "The wastewater from the dumping site usually contains high pollutant levels. Biological process and physico-chemical treatments are among several technologies for wastewater treatment. Using microorganisms in the treatment of landfill leachate is an emerging research issue. Furthermore, bioremediation is a feasible approach for pollutants removal from landfill leachate which would provide an efficient way to resolve the issue of landfill leachate. In this study, the performance of yeast and bacteria isolated from kefir grains was assessed for landfill leachate treatment. Kefir grains microbial composition was evaluated by molecular approaches (Rep-PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing). The obtained outcomes denoted that high concentrations of lactic acid bacteria and yeast populations (over 107  CFU/ml) were found in the kefir grains and were essentially composed of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobaccillus kefirien, bacillus sp., L. lactis, and Kluyveromyces marxianus. The co-culture with 1% of inoculum size was demonstrated as the most efficient in the degradation of different contaminants. The overall abatement rate of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (  NH 4 + - N  ), and salinity were 75.8%, 85.9%, and 75.13%, respectively. The bioremediation process resulted in up of 75% removal efficiency of Ni and Cd, and a 73.45%, 68.53%, and a 58.17% removal rates of Cu, Pb, and Fe, respectively. The research findings indicate the performance of L. lactis and K. marxianus co-culture isolated from kefir grains for the bioremediation of LFL. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Isolation and identification of microorganisms from kefir grains was carried out. Biological treatment of LFL using monoculture of (Lactoccocus lactis; Kluyveromyces marxianus) and co-culture (5% of L. lactis and 5% K. marxianus) has been performed. Biological treatment using co-culture strain is an effective approach to remove organic matter,  NH 4 + - N  and heavy metals.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this research was to determine how coadministration of ascorbic acid prior to the beginning of X-irradiation influences the lymphocyte DNA damage and also if the kefir supplementation to irradiated mice may alter the recovery procedure of lymphocyte genetic material injury. Following treatment of animals with these agents, the whole-body of mice were irradiated to 6 MV X-rays, then genotoxicity activity was investigated by comet assay. Our results show that the Total Comet Score (TCS) value was 1.39 and 1.5 fold less in the kefir and ascorbic acid groups respectively the following irradiation than in the irradiated mice only. Coadministration of ascorbic acid and kefir with 2 h, before relatively to 2 Gy radiation decreased DNA damage in lymphocyte blood cells. The antioxidant strength of ascorbic acid and kefir were investigated by the study of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging properties and also ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Our results revealed that ascorbic acid and kefir show strong antioxidant activity by these methods. According to these results, it seems that ascorbic acid and kefir, as a free radical scavenging capacitiy, protect animal lymphocyte blood cells from radiation-induced DNA injury and genotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Increased intestinal permeability has been shown to be involved in several diseases associated with low-grade chronic inflammation, including obesity and metabolic syndrome. In the last decade, growing evidence shows the beneficial effects of probiotic-containing food supplementation on these conditions. In this crossover intervention study on 28 asymptomatic overweight adults, we tested the effects of a 3-wk kefir supplementation compared with a 3-wk milk supplementation on serum zonulin levels. The effects on serum glucose, triacylglycerols, low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins, total cholesterol, markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein and adiponectin), anthropometric variables, mood, and appetite were also determined. Kefir supplementation resulted in a greater improvement of serum zonulin levels (F = 6.812, η2 = 0.275), whereas a significant yet similar improvement in lipid profile and serum glucose levels was found in both supplementations. Positive mood was slightly but significantly enhanced with kefir supplementation, and reduced with milk supplementation. The C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and appetite were unaffected. In conclusion, supplementation with both dairy products had health beneficial effects, but only kefir showed an effect on the intestinal barrier dysfunction marker.",
