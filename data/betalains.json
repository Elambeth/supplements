      "abstract": "Chenopodium quinoa Willd. is a betalainic crop with remarkable tolerance to extreme environmental conditions. Despite numerous varieties grow at high altitudes, where UV-B radiation is intense, research on the effects of UV-B stress on this and related species is very scarce. In the present work we aimed to determine whether UV-B radiation induces the production of betalains, and evaluated the role of these pigments and other key antioxidants in preventing oxidative damage, in seedlings of C. quinoa (ecotypes CICA and Villarrica) and its close relative C. berlandieri Moq., grown in darkness and after exposure to an acute pulse of UV-B radiation (24 h, 2.5 W m-2). UV-B significantly increased MDA accumulation and induced the production of betalains (particularly betacyanins), polyphenols and UV-B-absorbing compounds in all seedlings tested. The activity of antioxidant enzymes showed comparatively minor changes, with the exception of GPOX which consistently decreased after UV-B irradiation. The degree of oxidative damage was not correlated to the concentration of betalains present in the tissues at the end of the treatment. However, when pigment synthesis was stimulated by short white light pulses prior to UV-B irradiation, the increase in MDA levels could be prevented in C. berlandieri seedlings despite no major changes occurred in most of the remaining metabolites evaluated, suggesting that betalains have an important role in controlling oxidative damage in this species. In contrast, the presence of high levels of polyphenolic compounds rather than the accumulation of betalains contributed to improved UV-B tolerance in C. quinoa seedlings.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin is a potentially active signaling molecule and plays a crucial role in regulating the growth and development of plants under stress conditions, alleviating oxidative damage, enhancing antioxidant defence mechanisms and regulating ion homeostasis. This study examined the effects of exogenous melatonin application on leaf biomass, ion concentrations, betalains, phenolic acid and endogenous melatonin contents comparing red beet (Beta vulgaris L. 'Ruby Queen' and 'Scarlet Supreme') and white beet ('Rodeo' and 'Ansa') cultivars under increasing salinity levels of 50, 150, and 250 mM NaCl. Exogenous melatonin increased salinity-induced reductions in fresh and dry weights and osmotic potential in leaves. Na+ concentrations rose significantly with increasing salinity, but cultivar-specific decreases were observed in K+ and Ca2+ concentrations. Additionally, melatonin application improved betalain, betanin and neobetanin contents induced by salt stress. Furthermore, melatonin application caused salt stress and cultivar-specific changes in phenolic acid contents e.g., ferulic acid, sinapic acid, or m-coumaric acid, in soluble free, ester- and glycoside-conjugated and cell wall-bound forms. In addition, antioxidant enzyme activities and compound contents increased significantly in the beets and were subsequently lowered in a cultivar-specific manner by salt stress + melatonin treatment. The current findings indicate that exogenous melatonin improved plant stress tolerance suppressing reactive oxygen species levels, increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities and compound contents and reducing the levels of Na+, maintaining an ionic homeostasis in the selected red and white sugar beet cultivars. It appears that melatonin application may help improve cultivar-specific salt tolerance by enhancing ion homeostasis and betalain and phenolic acid production levels in beets.",

      "abstract": "Although many drugs have been discovered to treat malaria infection, many of them face resistance from the host's body with long-term use. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the activity of betalains (from Beta vulgaris) and chloroquine (a reference drug) against brain oxidative stress induced by Plasmodium berghei in male mice. Two protocols were applied in this study: the therapeutic and prophylactic protocols. The results of the therapeutic protocol revealed a significant decrease in the level of parasitemia caused by P. berghei. Additionally, the histopathological changes in various brain regions were markedly improved after treatment with betalains. Regarding the prophylactic protocol, betalains were able to protect the brain tissues from oxidative stress, inflammation, and disrupted neurotransmitters expected to occur as a result of infection by P. berghei. This was demonstrated by modulating the activities of brain antioxidants (SOD and GSH), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-α, and INF-γ), and neurotransmitters (serotonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine). This study has proven that using betalains as a treatment or as a preventive has a vital and effective role in confronting the brain histopathological, oxidative stress, and inflammatory changes induced by P. berghei infection."

      "abstract": "Betalain is a water-soluble pigment contained in Caryophyllales plants. It not only holds potential as a natural food colorant but also offers various health benefits, acting as an antioxidant. This study focused on analyzing the pH-dependent stability of encapsulated betalain pigments extracted from red beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) using methods such as absorption spectroscopy, HPLC, and LC-MS. The major pigments identified were vulgaxanthin I, betanin, isobetanin, and neobetanin, alongside minor components, including three betaxanthin species and a degradation product known as betalamic acid. Spectrophotometric analyses revealed that above pH 8, the betalain peak at 435 nm decreased and red-shifted to a peak at 549 nm, a shift that could be reversed through neutral pH treatment. At pH 11, a new broad peak appeared at 410 nm and was identified as betalamic acid. To assess the pH-dependency of each betalain, the targeted betalains were separated and quantified through HPLC after incubation across a wide pH range of 2-11 and during storage. After 3 days of storage in highly alkaline conditions (pH 10-11), major betalains, with the exception of neobetanin, underwent significant degradation. Conversely, these pigments displayed relative stability in acidic conditions. In contrast, neobetanin showed vulnerability to acidic conditions but exhibited tolerance to alkaline pH levels of 10-11. The degradation product, betalamic acid, demonstrated a similar susceptibility to alkaline pH as betanins. In conclusion, the significant stability decrease under highly alkaline conditions results not only from the hydrolytic reaction of betalains but also from the degradation of betalamic acid itself. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Encapsulation methods are used to enhance the stability of betalains against temperature variations; however, the effects of pH, especially when considering individual betalain species, are not well understood. Despite betalains exhibiting similar features and being suitable for a wide pH range from acid to alkaline conditions, they are significantly affected by alkaline pH levels exceeding 10, as well as by storage duration. This study demonstrated the application of encapsulation to pH-dependent stability, and the findings offer valuable insights and a fresh perspective on betalains as red biocolorants, extending their potential application to a wide range of pH-controlled food products.",

      "abstract": "Natural pigments are components very important in the dye industry. The betalains are pigments found in plants from Caryophyllales order and are relevant in the food manufacturing. The main source of betalains is beetroot, which has unfavorable aftertaste. Therefore, the demand for alternative species producing betalains has increased. Elicitor molecules such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA) induce metabolic reprogramming acting in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites and can enhance pigment concentrations. Here, we used this strategy to identify if treatment with MeJA at 100 µM can promote the accumulation of betalains and other bioactive compounds in Alternanthera philoxeroides and Alternanthera sessilis. We performed the gene expression, concentration of betalains, phenols, flavonoids, amino acids (phenylalanine and tyrosine), and antioxidant activity. The results showed that MeJA treatment increased betalains and other bioactive compounds in the two Alternanthera species but A. sessilis had a better performance. One key factor in this pathway is related to the phenylalanine and tyrosine concentration. However, the species have distinct metabolic regulation: in A. philoxeroides, high concentrations of betalain pigments increase the tyrosine concentration and gene expression (include ADH) under MeJA and in A. sessilis, high concentrations of betalain pigments reduce the gene expression and tyrosine concentration after 2 days under MeJA. This study brings new questions about betalain biosynthesis and sheds light on the evolution of this pathway in Caryophyllales.",

      "abstract": "Betalains are plant pigments with biological properties and can be used instead of synthetic colorants to confer color and functional properties to foods. The objective of this work was to carry out the chemical characterization of two varieties of prickly pear of Opuntia ficus-indica, one of yellow-orange coloration (Mandarina) and the other of purple coloration (Vigor), through measurements of chemical parameters and color in pulp, antioxidant activity, total phenolic compounds, and betalain content. Considering the thermolability of betalains and their potential applications in food, the thermal stability and activation energy of betacyanins from Vigor variety and betaxanthins from the Mandarina variety were also evaluated and compared with those from beetroot, the main source of betalains. Results for chemical characterization agreed with previous prickly pear reports of other regions, while the thermal degradation kinetics of betalains showed a first-order degradation pattern with respect to time and temperature treatment. Betacyanins from Vigor prickly pear showed similar thermal stability to those from beetroot, which was reflected in similar values of activation energy, while betaxanthins from Mandarina prickly pear showed a higher stability, and therefore a higher activation energy, than those from beetroot. Based on the results, the prickly pear varieties used in this study can be considered as a good source of betalains with potential applications in food and, in addition, the methodology for the evaluation of thermostability can be used to compare the stability of betalains from different sources in a temperature range of 50-90°C. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The varieties of prickly pear used in this study can be considered a good source of red-purple and yellow-orange easily extractable pigments. In addition, we report a methodology that can be used for the evaluation of the thermal stability of these pigments and to compare this stability between different plant sources. Gaining knowledge on betalain thermal stability will make it possible to propose specific applications, for example, in processed foods requiring different pigment stabilities.",

The encapsulation efficiency of the betalains was above 79%, and the particle size and Zeta potential values were 275.46 nm and -29.01 mV, respectively. Compared to the control sample, onset temperature and DPPH free radical scavenging of betalains microcapsules under the modest ultrasound treatment (200 W, 5 min) was increased by 1.6 °C and 12.24%, respectively. This increase could be due to the ability of ultrasonification to create interactions between maltodextrin and betalains (as evidenced by FT-IR).

Although activities described for betalain-containing formulations include cancer prevention and treatment, the use of extracts instead of purified pigments has avoided the investigation of the real chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential of these phytochemicals. Three betalain-rich extracts and six individual pure betalains were used in this work to characterize the activity and to explore possible molecular mechanisms. The animal model Caenorhabditis elegans (tumoral strain JK1466) was used to evaluate the effect of betalains as chemotherapeutics drugs. An objective evaluation method of tumor growth in C. elegans has been developed to assess the possible antitumoral activity of the different treatments. This protocol allowed a fast and reliable screening of possible antitumoral drugs. Among the betalains tested, tryptophan-betaxanthin reduced tumor size by 56.4% and prolonged the animal's lifespan by 9.3%, indicating high effectiveness and low toxicity. Structure-activity relationships are considered. Assays with mutant strains of C. elegans showed that the mechanism underlying these effects was the modulation of the DAF-16 transcription factor and the insulin signaling pathway. Our results indicate that tryptophan-betaxanthin and related betalains are strong candidates as antitumoral molecules in cancer treatment."

Herein, we expand upon our previous observations and demonstrate the analgesic and antioxidant effect of betalains. Betalains [10-1000 mg/kg; intraperitoneal route (i.p.)] diminished acetic acid- and PBQ-induced abdominal contortions, and the overt pain-like behaviour induced by complete Freund`s adjuvant (CFA) and formalin (intraplantar; i.pl.) injection. Moreover, betalains (100 mg/kg) administered by various routes [i.p. or subcutaneous (s.c.)] or as a post-treatment reduced carrageenin- or CFA-induced hyperalgesia. Mechanistically, betalains mitigated carrageenin-induced tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, superoxide anion levels, and lipid peroxidation. Betalains also stopped the depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and ferric reducing ability produced by carrageenin, as well as upregulated Nrf2 and Ho1 transcript expression in the plantar tissue of mice. Furthermore, betalains showed hydroxyl radical, 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical (ABTS+), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl radical (DPPH•) scavenging ability and iron-chelating activity (bathophenantroline assay), and inhibited iron-independent and iron-dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) in vitro. Finally, betalains-treated bone marrow-derived macrophages exhibited lower levels of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), and superoxide anion levels and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Therefore, this betalain-rich dye extracted using a novel precipitation approach presents prominent analgesic effect in varied models of pain by mechanisms targeting cytokines and oxidative stress.",

Composition, stability, influencing factors, processing effects have been widely investigated. Carotenoids isomerize and oxidize while anthocyanins undergo hydrolysis, nucleophilic attack of water, ring fission, and polymerization during thermal processing. Betacyanins suffer deglycosylation, isomerization, dehydrogenation, hydrolysis, and decarboxylation. Biotechnological production dominates research on carotenoids as food colorants while the search for plant sources continues with anthocyanins and betalains. Stabilization studies presently focus on microencapsulation and nanoencapsulation. For anthocyanins, co-pigmentation has also been intensely researched. Carotenoids have been the most studied in terms of health effects, involving epidemiological, cell, animal, and human intervention studies, yet some inconsistencies in the results persist. A wide range of biological activities have been attributed to anthocyanins and betalains, based mainly on cell and animal studies; human clinical studies are lacking.",

      "abstract": "Betalains are nitrogen-containing colorants with antioxidant properties that can be found in plant materials such as pitaya peels. However, thermo-stability of these natural colors may vary with different source, yet few study has reported the rate orders of degradation for pitaya-sourced betalains. In this study, accelerated storage test of betalains, namely betacyanin and betaxanthin, extracted from pitaya peel are investigated by heat treatment of the extract at elevated temperatures. The results show that degradation kinetics of betacyanins and betaxanthins can both fit first-order kinetics and Arrhenius equation with activation energies at - 49.2 kJ/mol and - 40.0 kJ/mol, respectively. The result of Student's t-test indicated that the predicted k values are statistically the same as compared to their corresponding experimental values. LSD estimation also showed that k value variation tendency of the two betalains appears to be the same at 60 °C or below, while betacyanins tend to degrade faster above 80 °C than betaxanthins due to higher coefficient value of k value variation. This result also suggests that the pitaya-sourced betalains tend to degrade gradually even though they are stored under refrigerated condition. However, the betalains showed appreciably lower rate of degradation if they are processed at 60 °C or below."

      "abstract": "Betalains are unique nitrogen-containing pigments found exclusively in families of the Caryophyllales order and some higher order fungi, where they replace anthocyanin pigments. Betalains, consisting of betacyanins and betaxanthins are generally used as color additives in food. This review discusses on the favorable effects of acute and chronic consumption of betalains, whose edible sources consist primarily of red beetroots (Beta vulgaris) and prickly pears (fruit of the Opuntia genus of cacti). Moreover, it encompasses in vivo and in vitro studies about the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of betanin and indicaxanthin. It seems that treatment with betalains and betalain-rich diets is not only nontoxic but could also prove to be a promising alternative to supplement therapies in oxidative stress-, inflammation-, and dyslipidemia-related diseases such as stenosis of the arteries, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and cancer, among others. Due to its toxicological safety, accessibility, low price, biodegradability, and potentially advantageous biological effects on health, the incorporation of betalains in food manufacturing and related industries could pave the way to overcome current concerns over the health risks of artificial colors. Nevertheless, further studies using pure betalains are required to gain a deeper understanding of their precise biological functions.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to develop a simple and reproducible method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of betalains in plasma samples, based on Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) and micro-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (micro-HPLC-MS/MS). The eight betalain compounds detected and quantified were characterized in the fortified rat blood plasma samples. The developed method showed a good coefficient of determination (R² = 0.999), good recovery, precision, and appropriate limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for these compounds. Application of this method for the treatment of rat plasma samples collected after the betalain preparation administration, for the first time, revealed the presence of native betalains and their metabolites in plasma samples. Moreover, among them, betanin (2.14 ± 0.06 µmol/L) and isobetanin (3.28 ± 0.04 µmol/L) were found at the highest concentration. The results indicated that the combination of an SPE method with a micro-HPLC-MS/MS analysis may be successfully applied for the determination of betalains in the blood plasma.",

Degradation of betalains followed first order kinetics while changes of L(∗), Hue angle and Chroma values fitted zero order and first order kinetic, respectively. Reaction rate for degradation of betalains, L(∗), Hue angle and Chroma values ranged between 1.588-30.975 × 10(-3) min(-1), 90.50-379.75 L(∗)min(-1), 0.581-5.008 Hue anglemin(-1) and 3.250-19.750 × 10(-3) min(-1), respectively. Between 70 and 90 °C, activation energy for the degradation of betalains was 42.449 kJ mol(-1). L(∗) values was more stable than Hue angle and Chroma color values in colored milk during heating. 74.150 kJ mol(-1), 111.174 kJ mol(-1) and 93.311 kJ mol(-1) of activation energy values were found for L(∗), Hue angle and Chroma values of milk, respectively. Significant positive and negative linear correlations were determined between betalains and color values. Multiple regression models were also established to predict the content of betalains in milk during thermal process by using color values.",

For the extraction, two solvent systems were used, methanol/water and ethanol/water. A three-variable Box-Behnken statistical design was used for extraction: solvent concentration (0-80%, v/v), temperature (5-30 °C), and treatment time (10-30 min). The extraction and stability of betalains from xoconostle were studied using response surface methodology (RSM). Techniques such as UV-vis, column chromatography, and HPLC were employed for the separation and analysis of the main pigments present in the extracts. Maximum pigment concentration (92 mg/100 g of fruit) was obtained at a temperature of 15 °C and a time of 10 min for methanol/water (20:80), whereas maximum stability of the pigment was observed at pH 5 and a temperature of 25 °C. HPLC chromatograms showed the main betalains of the xoconostle characterized were betalain, betanidin, and isobetalain.",

      "abstract": "Effectiveness of a betalains/sorbate curing system versus a conventional nitrite system for color development and control of microbial growth in chicken frankfurters was tested. Normal heat processing involved in the manufacture of frankfurters was successful in reducing cell levels of indigenous aerobic mesophiles, and spore levels of inoculated Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium sporogenes by 1 to 2 log cycles. There were no significant differences in numbers of C. perfringens spores for either treatment after 9 d of storage at 4 or 20°C. The two curing systems tested were also equally effective in controlling growth of C. sporogenes when tested at 20°C over a 9-d storage period. The betalains/sorbate system proved to be more effective in inhibiting growth of aerobic mesophiles over the 9-d storage period at both 4 and 20°C. It is concluded that in chicken frankfurters under the conditions of this experiment, a betalains/sorbate curing system provided the same level of microbiological protection as a nitrite curing system."

Pendula were used to study the influence of several treatment: white light, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), kinetin, gibberellic acid (GA3) on betalains biosynthesis. The pigments, betacyanins and betaxanthins, were separated using a Sephadex G-15 column chromatography. Qualitative as well as quantitative differences were observed according to the treatments applied.The amaranthin biosynthesis seemed to be favored in the absence of DOPA. Under the combined effect of kinetin and white light a small quantity of betanin was also synthesized. Adding exogenous DOPA led to a more diversified production which included betacyanins (amaranthin and betanin), betaxanthins (vulgaxanthin and miraxanthin), and even dopachrome. As a general rule, kinetin activated the betalains biosynthesis whereas GA3 inhibited it. The stimulating effect of white light was always much greater than that of kinetin."
