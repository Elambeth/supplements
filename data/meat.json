      "abstract": "Inulin, a natural dietary fiber, has various health-promoting bioactivities. However, the impacts of dietary inulin on duck productivity and overall health remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of inulin supplementation on systemic health and its underlying mechanisms by integrating the microbiota and metabolome analyses. One hundred twenty 16-day-old male Cherry Valley ducks with similar initial body weight (BW) were randomly assigned to 20 cages, with two treatments (6 ducks/cage and 10 cages/treatment): a basal diet (CON group) or a basal diet supplemented with 25 g inulin/kg (INU group). The 18-d feeding trials demonstrated that ducks fed the inulin-supplemented diet presented significantly improved growth performance, bone health, and meat quality compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, inulin supplementation reshaped the intestinal microbiota, increasing diversity and the abundance of Alistipes, Ligilactobacillus, and Streptococcus (P < 0.05). Metabolome analysis revealed that inulin feeding significantly modulated 13 metabolites (P < 0.05), which were enriched primarily in health-related metabolic pathways such as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and histidine metabolism. Correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship among the modulated microbes and metabolites and improved healthy parameters. Overall, inulin supplementation improved the bone and muscle health of ducks by specifically modulating key gut microbes, metabolites, and associated metabolic pathways. These findings suggest that inulin supplementation represents a feasible nutritional strategy for improving the meat quality and bone health of intensively raised ducks.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the intrinsic relationships between meat quality, protein properties, and enzyme activities of pork longissimus dorsi treated with L-lysine (Lys) during postmortem aging. METHODS: The pork was obtained from 18 twelve-month-old crossbred pigs (120 kg, Duroc × Long White Large × White, longissimus dorsi muscle) in three batches of six samples each. The meat was then immediately placed in a thermal container and transported to the laboratory within 1 hour for subsequent processing at 4 ℃. After removing fat and connective tissue, the pork was cut into 20 g ± 1 g meat blocks. Then, the samples were vacuum sealed and left in a freezer (4 ℃) for 0, 1 and 3 days. RESULTS: The results indicated that Lys addition (0.10%, 0.15%, and 0.20%) could improve pork quality (water-holding capacity and tenderness). On the third day of aging, the shear force values reached their lowest levels (P < 0.05), measuring 38.21 N, 34.04 N, and 30.94 N for the respective treatment groups. In addition, the postmortem addition of Lys significantly increased the myofibrillar fragmentation index and actomyosin solubility during pork aging (P < 0.05), with maximum values of 105.07 and 90.35%, respectively. Meanwhile, microscopic structure and electrophoresis results indicated that Lys treatment disrupted the muscle fiber structure, promoted the degradation of MPs (myofibrillar proteins) and dissociation of actomyosin. Furthermore, with increasing Lys addition, calpain-1 activity, caspase-3 activity, and Ca2+-ATPase activity in the muscle significantly increased (P < 0.05), reaching maximum values of 17.46 ng/mL, 55.68 µg/mL, and 2.79 μmol (Pi)/min·mg protein, respectively. The activation of these enzymes promoted the dissociation and hydrolysis of key structural proteins. CONCLUSION: Lys improved pork quality by activating calpain-1, caspase-3, and Ca2+-ATPase activity during the postmortem aging, thereby promoting the degradation of MPs and the dissociation of the actomyosin."

      "abstract": "Resistant starch (RS) is recognized as a nutritional strategy that supports gut and overall host health by modulating gut microbiota. To directly assess the effects of RS on gut microbiota and its role in improving intestinal barrier function in meat ducks, this study first established an antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis model, which was characterized by reduced gut microbial diversity, intestinal dysfunction, and an inflammatory outburst following antibiotic exposure. Whereafter, in addition to the control group, ducks treated with antibiotics for 7 consecutive days were further allocated to two groups and fed the basal diet and RS diet that derived from 12 % raw potato starch until 21 d. The results demonstrated that dietary RS supplementation reversed the antibiotic-induced reduction in microbial diversity and restored the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio. Additionally, RS inclusion enriched beneficial bacterial genera, including Coprobacter, Odoribacter, and Faecalibacterium (LDA score > 3). Post-antibiotic intervention led to a reduction in villus density and muscular thickness, accompanied by a significant downregulation (P < 0.05) of zonula occludens-1 and mucin-2 expression, along with increased serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (P < 0.05). Notably, dietary RS supplementation significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) the expression of glucagon-like peptide receptor and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2, while suppressing caspase transcription. This resulted in increased villus height and muscular thickness in the ileum (P < 0.05). Furthermore, RS intervention remarkably reduced (P < 0.05) pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, particularly interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, in both the ileum and serum. These effects were likely linked to alterations in cecal microbiota, including increased abundances of Barnesiella, Ruminiclostridium 9, Megamonas, Faecalitalea, Adlercreutzia, Coprobacter and Collinsella. In conclusion, dietary RS supplementation mitigated antibiotic-induced cecal microbial dysbiosis and restored intestinal structure by promoting enterocyte proliferation and reducing apoptosis. Consequently, RS supplementation helped alleviate systemic inflammation in meat ducks following antibiotic treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of selenium (Se) on animal health due to its antioxidant and immune system regulatory properties are very well-documented. However, there is still a lack of scientific evidence about the effect of Se on muscle tissue. Se supplementation in ruminants will enhance the antioxidant activity of myocytes and increase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Generating bioactive peptides derived from meat could prevent the production of angiotensin II, a key player in the development of cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Forty-five suckling goat kids were randomized into one of three groups: (1) CG: group without Se supplemented in the diet; (2) GSS: group with a single injectable dose subcutaneously of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg of body weight; (3) GSM: group with an oral administration of selenomethionine (SeMe) at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg of body weight). The effect of both sources of Se was evaluated on the proximate composition of meat and liver and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of meat-derived enzymatic hydrolysates. RESULTS: The kids-goat meat from the GSM group had a higher protein content (p < 0.05). The fat content gradually increased over time in the treatment GSM, which increased ca. two-fold (from 1.77 to 3.68). The degree of hydrolysis of the meat samples decreased (p < 0.05) in the treatments supplemented with Se (GSS and GSM). The degree of hydrolysis increased significantly (p < 0.05) over time in treatments with Se (GSS and GSM). The electrophoretic patterns of the enzymatic hydrolysates at two h showed a molecular weight between 23.44 and 27.5 kDa, the bands with more intensity. At 21 d of slaughter, a major degree of hydrolysis was observed in the treatments supplemented with Se (GSS and GSM) compared to the CG. Meat protein content and rate of ACE inhibition after hydrolysis improved (50% and 2%, p < 0.05) with GSM at 7 d of slaughter. After hydrolysis, the IC50 of the selenium-supplemented groups decreased (p < 0.05) the amount of CAE and IC50 values. CONCLUSION: This is the first report describing the ACE inhibitory activity of bioactive peptides derived from goat-kids meat with supplemental. These results indicate the presence of ACE in goat meat; however, the percentage of ACE inhibition after hydrolysis was only improved with selenomethionine dosing at 7 days of slaughter. The study's novelty indicates that supplemented selenium synergized with ACE in goat meat. It is necessary to continue these studies to identify specific bioactive peptides, antioxidant activities, and goat meat's biological and functional value, considering it a functional food that can prevent metabolic diseases and be a healthy alternative for the human population.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated whether the supplementation of prebiotic inulin to gestating sows programmatically affects offspring growth performance and meat quality while exploring its epigenetic effects through histone acetylation modulation. After mating, sixty multiparous sows (Landrace × Yorkshire; parity 2-3) were assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with inulin (0% vs. 1.5%) and fat (0% or 5%) supplementation until farrowing. Post-weaning, five litters (10 piglets per litter) per treatment were selected and maintained in their original litter for fattening under standardized feeding. The results demonstrated that maternal inulin supplementation during gestation accomplished the following: (1) Increased offspring liver index by 13.4% at weaning and 6.8% at finishing (p < 0.05) while reducing the finishing-phase backfat thickness by 11.6% (p < 0.01), with a significant inulin × fat interaction attenuating fat-induced abdominal lipid accumulation at weaning (p = 0.05). (2) Decreased longissimus dorsi muscle lightness (L*) by 4.5% in finishing pigs (p = 0.02) without altering the other meat quality parameters. (3) Suppressed offspring liver lipid deposition at birth and finishing (p < 0.05), concomitant with upregulated hepatic PGC-1α and CPT1A expression (p < 0.05). (4) Elevated neonatal serum butyrate by 15.6% (p = 0.06) while inhibiting hepatic histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and enhancing histone H3/H4 acetylation (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that maternal inulin supplementation during gestation mitigates offspring hepatic lipid deposition through butyrate-mediated epigenetic regulation, where microbial-derived butyrate from inulin fermentation inhibits HDAC activity, enhances histone acetylation levels, and upregulates fatty acid β-oxidation gene expression. This study provides novel mechanistic insights into how maternal dietary fiber nutrition programs offspring development through epigenetic reprogramming."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Broiler chickens are excellent animals for protein production and play an essential role in the food industry. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of coated sodium butyrate (CSB) on the biochemical indices, antioxidant capacity, meat quality, fatty acid composition, and gut health of Xianju broilers. METHODS: A total of 192 one-day-old broilers were randomly divided into four treatment groups: the basal diet (CK), the basal diet with 250 mg/kg CSB (CSB250), the basal diet with 500 mg/kg CSB500 (CSB500), and the basal diet with 1000 mg/kg CSB (CSB1000). Each group included six replicates, with eight chicks per replicate. RESULTS: We found that CSB supplementation in the diets has no function on plasma biochemical indices; however, CSB1000 broilers exhibited markedly elevated plasma TG levels. Furthermore, CSB supplementation at different concentrations significantly increased plasma antioxidase capacity in broilers. Moreover, breast meat supplemented with CSB displayed a higher shear force, pH24h, and inosinic acid content than CK meat. Breast meat of broilers fed CSB1000 showed improved fatty acid composition, evidenced by increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (C16:1, C18:2, C22:4, and C22:6). Moreover, supplementation with CSB1000 optimized the gut microbiota composition, particularly by enhancing the abundance of Firmicutes and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings offer a basis for the extensive application of CSB as a feed addition to enhance the quality of meat in the broiler sector.",

      "abstract": "Salmonella is a prominent zoonotic pathogen that continues to represent a large threat to food safety and public health worldwide. Concurrently, the inappropriate use of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella, highlighting the urgent need for new approaches to manage these bacteria. In this context, virulent bacteriophages are increasingly recognized as a potential and effective biological control method against Salmonella. This study identifies two newly isolated virulent Salmonella phages, phage vB_SalD_ABTNLS3 (S3 for short) and phage 2-3 (2-3 for short). Both phages exhibited effectiveness in preventing biofilm formation and reducing biofilm. S3 and 2-3 could maximize the inhibition of more than 70% and 91% of biofilm formation after 48 h of treatment, and maximize the removal of more than 59% and 96% of mature biofilm after 3 h and 5 h, respectively. Based on these, our study assessed the efficacy of 2-3 in controlling Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (SE) on raw chicken meat at 4°C with varying MOIs, including 1, 100, and 10,000. The maximum reduction observed in SE on chicken meat was 1.15 log10 CFU/mL following a 12-h treatment with the 2-3, a significant decrease of more than 92% compared to the initial levels present in the experiment (MOI = 10,000). In conclusion, our phages performed well in controlling biofilm and disinfecting refrigerated food at 4°C, suggesting their potential as biological agents to reduce Salmonella contamination in the food industry."

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effectiveness of antibiotic, probiotic, and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) supplements in mitigating adverse consequences of necrotic enteritis (NE) in broilers. In total, 720 one-day-old (Ross-308) male broiler chicks were randomly assigned to five distinct feeding regimens (each treatment consisting of six replicates of 24 birds) including: (1) negative control (NC), fed only basal diet; (2) positive control (PC); with C. perfringens challenge + basal diet; (3) CP-Ab: challenged + virginiamycin (Stafac® 500) at 200 g/ton, (4) CP-Pro: challenged + 200 g/ton B. subtilis PB6 (Clostat dry®) probiotic additive, and (5) CP-LS2: challenged and fed an antimicrobial peptide (LassoTide Plus®) at 200 g/ton. The NE challenge was induced by administering 10X coccidia vaccine on day 15 followed by inoculation with a pathogenic field strain of C. perfringens type G (1 × 108 CFU/ml/ bird; 1 ml) on days 19 and 20 through oral gavage. Feeding AMP and probiotic to the NE-affected broilers resulted in 23.93% and 19.70% respectively higher body weight gain and 76.59% and 70.27% lower mortality compared to the PC. Similarly, supplementation with AMP improved (P < 0.05) gut morphology, carcass yield (5.82%), meat water holding capacity (14.73%), and reduced cooking loss (10.01%), dripping loss (20.87%), and shear force (25%) as compared to the PC. Additionally, the excreta score, litter quality and welfare attributes were significantly ameliorated (P < 0.05) with AMP addition. In conclusion, the findings suggest that AMP outperformed both virginiamycin and probiotic, demonstrating its potential as a superior substitute for AGPs in broilers.",

This study investigated the effects of HI and TM meals - alone and as a mixture (MIX, 1:1) - on productive performance, nutrient digestibility, carcass traits, and meat quality of broiler chickens. After assessing the nutrient digestibility of the insect meals (72 26-day-old male broilers, 4 treatments, 9 cages/treatment, 2 birds/cage), a total of 420 1-day-old male broiler chicks were allotted to 7 diets for 37 days (6 pens/diet, 10 birds/pen): C (control), HI5 (5 % HI), HI10 (10 % HI), TM5 (5 % TM), TM10 (10 % TM), MIX5 (5 % MIX), and MIX10 (10 % MIX). In the whole experimental period, better feed efficiency was observed in TM5, TM10 and MIX5 than C, HI10 and MIX10 birds (P < 0.001). Overall, TM5 and MIX5 groups showed the highest slaughtering, ready-to-cook carcass, and chilled carcass weights, while the lowest values were observed in HI10 and MIX10 (P < 0.001). Meat pH and color were limitedly influenced by dietary insect meal inclusion, while higher breast cooking losses were observed in HI10 birds than C, HI5 and MIX5 (P < 0.001). Higher breast dry matter was observed in HI5 birds than TM5 and HI10 (P < 0.001), with the same broilers displaying greater breast crude protein than TM5 (P < 0.001). The highest and lowest percentage of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively, were observed in TM10 birds, along with the lowest polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acids ratio (P < 0.001). The TM5, HI5 and HI10 meat displayed lower tenderness than C meat (P = 0.001), with lower juiciness and overall liking being also overall identified for TM5 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, including 5 % of TM and MIX meals in diets for broiler chickens improved growth performance and carcass traits, while the 10 % inclusion level of HI and MIX meals was associated with the worst outcomes. Including 10 % of HI meal or using TM meal (mainly 5 %) also worsened meat quality and consumer perception."

      "abstract": "In Denmark, the Yellow Card scheme enforces restrictions on pig herds exceeding official permitted limits for antimicrobial use (AMU). To assess if a Yellow Card is related to poor animal health, we examined the association between AMU and the health status of Danish finishers using meat inspection data as a proxy for pig health. We included meat inspection findings in 10.5 million finishers delivered to 9 Danish abattoirs between 2016 and 2020 from herds classified as having a low, medium, or high AMU (Yellow Card herds). The prevalence of meat inspection findings was calculated and analysed in mixed-effects logistic regression models to determine the associations between each of eight selected lesions and AMU level while also considering the effect of herd size, location (east or west) and herd type (indoor or outdoor). Despite differences in AMU, only minor differences in meat inspection lesions were present. The overall result of the multivariable modelling was that herds with a medium AMU level were associated with the lowest prevalence of meat inspection lesions - observed for five out of the eight lesions investigated. Moreover, large herds were associated with a lower prevalence of meat inspection lesions than small herds - observed for seven out of eight lesions. The prevalence of lung and tail lesions was higher for herds in the western region of Denmark compared to the eastern regions, and the prevalence of tail lesions, arthritis and osteomyelitis was higher in outdoor herds compared to indoor herds. Hence, both a high and a low AMU could be linked with health and welfare issues. The results indicate that the advisory role of the herd veterinarian is pivotal in preventing adverse effects of antimicrobial reduction measures on animal health and welfare, in particular, if the Yellow Card limits are reduced further."

A total of 24 Suffolk lambs [3 months of age, 21.4 ± 1.08 kg body weight (BW)] were allocated for 60 days to three treatments (8 lambs per treatment) in a completely randomized design, as follows: 1- SBM at 150 g/kg dry matter (DM)], 2- FM at 50 g/kg DM, and 3- TMM at 60 g/kg DM. Feed intake, BW, and blood samples were collected on days 0, 20, 40, and 60. At the end of the trial, the lambs were slaughtered for carcass evaluation and meat quality assessment. The average daily gain was higher for SBM-fed than for TMM-fed lambs (0.25 and 0.21 kg/d; P < 0.001). Plasma levels of creatinine were higher in FM-fed when compared to SBM-fed lambs, while TMM-fed lambs showed intermediate values (88.72, 85.69 and 87.57 μmol/L, respectively; P < 0.05). The hot and cold carcass weights (15.99 and 15.52 kg vs 18.49 and 18.03 kg) and yields (44.31 and 43.02 % vs 46.03 and 44.87 %) were lower in the TMM group compared with the SBM group (P < 0.05). The dietary treatment had no effect (P > 0.05) on meat pH, color, texture, water loss and contents of fat, protein, and moisture. Further research should evaluate optimal inclusion levels of TMM in combination with conventional protein sources to avoid negative economic implications."

In this study, the effects of adding citrus flavonoids to the diet on growth performance, feed efficiency, rumen morphology, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of Awassi lambs were investigated. Thirty-six male lambs (27.36 ± 0.025 kg initial body weight) at 14 weeks of age were individually allocated to 3 dietary treatments (T1 = basal diet without any additives, T2 = basal diet with 0.4 g Bioflavex/kg diet dry matter and T3 = basal diet with 0.8 g Bioflavex/kg diet dry matter) with 12 lambs as replicates per treatment in a completely randomized design. Performance was evaluated, including body weight, weight gain, growth rate and feed conversion ratio over 56 days. At the end of the study, all lambs were slaughtered to measure rumen histomorphology and carcass and meat characteristics. The results showed that T2 and T3 had higher growth indicators, carcass weights of hot and cold and better feed conversion than T1 (p < 0.05). In addition, lambs fed T2 and T3 had higher rumen histomorphology parameters (papilla length, papilla width, papilla surface area, and total surface of papillae) than lambs fed T1 (p < 0.05). Shoulder weight, backfat thickness, body wall fat and carcass redness decreased, while foreshank and breast weight increased with the addition of Bioflavex (p < 0.05). Shear force, cooking loss, water holding capacity, and myofibril fragmentation index were lower with Bioflavex than with T1 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the study showed that supplementation with citrus flavonoids (0.8 g Bioflavex/kg diet dry matter) can have a positive effect on lamb growth, rumen development and meat quality."

      "abstract": "Reducing meat consumption, especially in high-intake countries such as the United States, is crucial in mitigating the climate and biodiversity crises and improving public health and animal welfare. Choice-architecture interventions or nudges in the food domain, such as choice defaults (e.g., reduced default portion sizes), can be powerful levers of behavior change. However, evidence remains limited in large-scale, real-life settings, and little is known about potential effects on diner satisfaction and backfiring effects that reduce or even reverse the desired behavior. These uncertainties have posed substantial barriers to scalability and wider adoption by the food service industry. In our single-blinded, quasi-experimental, pre-registered field interventions in Stanford University dining halls with staff-served portions, a 25% reduction in the serving spoon size (Study 1, 24 days, 364 diners, made-to-order burritos) produced a non-significant trend of 18% less meat served per day without reducing overall diner satisfaction (p = 0.059, d = 0.64) but with a wide CI that included the null (- 49.2, 1.07). A more substantial 50% reduction in serving spoon size (Study 2, 29 days, 1802 diners, varying menu items) did not reduce the amount of meat served (p = 0.60, d = 0.20), triggered backfiring effects, and significantly decreased diner satisfaction. Combining the two studies, the intervention did not significantly reduce meat consumption. While the trends in our findings are consistent with the 'norm range model'-i.e., that moderate portion reductions may decrease intake but drastic reductions may prompt compensatory eating-key differences and contextual nuances between the two studies help explain the mixed results. Future studies on the 'norm range' of default portion size nudges to reduce meat consumption across different menu items and food service models is suggested to increase our understanding of effective and scalable interventions that facilitate collective shifts towards more sustainable dietary behaviors.",

This study investigated the synergistic bacteriostatic effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and indole-3-carboxaldehyde (I3A). Results showed a pronounced synergistic action of EGCG and I3A against diverse food spoilage microorganisms, most notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), with a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.25. Further research revealed that EGCG disrupted the cell wall and cell membrane of P. aeruginosa, while supplementing I3A significantly boosted the concentration of intracellular reactive oxygen species, thereby inflicting cellular damage. Moreover, the EGCG-I3A treatment inhibited the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in a dose-dependent manner, with the effectiveness increasing with the quantity of I3A added. Metabolomic study revealed a perturbation in glutathione and taurine metabolic pathways post synergistic treatment, compromising redox homeostasis. This synergistic treatment also downregulated uracil, proline, and glutamate metabolites, thereby suppressing Quorum Sensing (QS) and biofilm-associated expression within P. aeruginosa. Additionally, the combination significantly inhibited P. aeruginosa growth in fish meat. In essence, this study underscored the synergistic bacteriostatic efficacy of EGCG and I3A, highlighting its potential application in food preservation."

The quality was evaluated on the basis of physical and barrier properties, as well as lipid oxidation for coated and uncoated chicken meat. Chicken breast meat was cut into small pieces, pasteurized, and coated with the active film solution. The active gelatin-chitosan film enriched was prepared with different concentrations of rosemary extract (0 to 2%). The application of the coating solution, with or without ultrasonic treatment was conducted. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to freeze drying for 72 h. The water activity, color, hygroscopic, and rehydration properties of the freeze-dried coated meat were measured. Moreover, the lipid oxidation of the coated vs. uncoated meat was also investigated during a 6 month storage period. Results showed that the coating can form a non-porous surface, which resists the exchange of water vapor, thereby decreasing hygroscopicity and rehydration rates. Likewise, the reduction in the color change and the level of malondialdehyde proved that the active coating allowed good preservation of the meat samples against lipid oxidation during the storage period. However, the application of coating with the use of ultrasound treatment did not positively affect lipid oxidation reduction, and an even higher value was observed in comparison to samples immersed in film forming solutions without ultrasound treatment. It can be concluded that the phenolic compounds incorporated into the film matrix had antioxidant activity, minimizing the extent of lipid oxidation in foods."

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of HIU application in meat from two rabbit breeds (Flemish Giant, FG and Azteca Negro, AN) on its physicochemical parameters (PQs) and sensory profile (SEN). Five carcasses of each breed were frozen and dorsally cut into half carcasses. HIU was applied (20 min, 50 kHz, and 200 W) to one randomly selected half carcass of each rabbit. PQs evaluated were pH, color (L*, a*, and b*), chroma (C*), hue angle (HUE), water holding capacity (WHC), collagen content, and shear force (SF). Color, odor, flavor, and texture were evaluated for the SEN. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, adjusting a general mixed model with the fixed effects of treatment, breed, and their interaction. Significant interaction differences (p < 0.05) of breed and HIU were observed in the collagen content. Breed had an effect (p < 0.05) on pH, a*, b*, C*, and on the descriptors of the sensory attribute color. HIU had an effect (p < 0.05) on L*, a*, HUE, C*, and SF, as well as on sensory descriptors like texture and color. HIU increases the physicochemical and sensory perception of the tenderness of the meat of both breeds."

      "abstract": "Contemporary poultry farming involves extensive antibiotic use, which could potentially pose health risks to consumers through antibiotic residues in animal-derived food products, especially meat. Recent decisions, particularly the ban on nearly all antibiotic feed additives utilized as growth promoters, have resulted in a decrease in their usage. Nonetheless, their essential role in therapy and their economic value are indisputable. This study evaluated the presence of antibiotic residues in marketed turkey meat using the four-box method. The analyses indicated that, of the 400 samples examined, the overall prevalence of contamination was 65.75%. Among the different types of antibiotics identified in the samples, β-lactam/tetracycline residues were the highest, with a prevalence of 41.44%. The analysis of different sample types revealed significant contamination rates in turkey organs, particularly the liver, with a contamination prevalence of approximately 83.75%, and the wing muscle, 78.75%. Two antibiotic families, β-lactam and tetracycline, were identified in the wing muscle and liver at frequencies of 44.44% and 43.28%, respectively. Regarding cross-contamination, positive samples exhibited contamination concurrently by a specific type of residue, with a notable rate of 58.19%. All analyzed organs exhibited contamination by multiple residue types, with varying contaminants present in different organs. The findings indicated varying detection rates of antibiotic residues in consumed turkey meat. These highlight the excessive use of antibiotics in the poultry industry, increasing consumer exposure to these residues'associated risks. Therefore, it is essential to implement stricter measures and monitoring systems regarding the use of antibiotics in poultry farming.",

This study analyzed the changes in lipids and volatile compounds in crayfish muscle subjected to three thermal processes: boiling (BO), air-frying (AF), and boiling combined air-frying (BO-AF). Aldehydes and heterocyclic compounds were found to be the predominant volatile compounds in crayfish muscle during thermal processing and storage. The intensity of lipid oxidation (POV, TBARS and p-AnV) was greatest in AF, and was notably lower in BO-AF. the total concentration of free fatty acids (FFAs) was highest in the AF group (4.14 mg/g) after processing, followed by BO (3.26 mg/g) and BO-AF (2.04 mg/g). During storage, the FFAs content gradually decreased, with generally lower levels observed at 65 °C compared to 45 °C. A total of 383 phospholipid species were identified, phosphatidylethanolamine being the primary difference lipid type in BO (26.7 %) and AF (36.7 %), while fatty acids were the main differential lipid types in BO-AF group, under the comparison between processed and stored. Overall, the BO-AF method improved the flavor sensory and decreased lipid oxidation, compared to the other two methods. These findings provide valuable insights into the effects of different thermal processing and storage methods on the quality and safety of crayfish muscle."

Compared with the shelf life of 14 days at 4 °C, the shelf life of prepared pork chops was extended to 56 days at -2 °C storage. The content of carbonyl groups, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), and total viable count (TVC) values were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The super-chilled storage effectively delayed the oxidation of proteins and lipids. The 16srRNA gene amplicon sequencing results showed that the microbial communities of marinated pork chops between -2 °C and 4 °C storages showed a high similarity, except for Serratia, a specific spoilage bacteria in high O2 MAP storing at 4 °C. The gas composition significantly affected the bacterial communities in the different treatment groups (P < 0.05). The spoilage biomarkers in high O2 and high CO2 MAPs were Brochothrix and Leuconostoc, respectively. Significant differences were also observed between high O2 and high CO2 MAPs for the functional potentials based on KEGG, especially for carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (P < 0.05). The results of this paper provide valuable information for the preservation strategies of prepared meat products."

Ciprofloxacin, a widely used antibiotic in poultry farming, promotes growth and disease prevention but raises concerns about antibiotic residues in meat and the development of antibiotic resistance. This study examines the dietary effects of WH and ciprofloxacin on broiler growth rate, feed conversion ratio (FCR), meat quality, and muscle histology. Ninety broilers were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group, a WH-supplemented group (2.5% of daily feed), and a ciprofloxacin (Cipro) group (8 mg/kg body weight). Feed consumption and body weight were monitored daily, and after sacrifice, breast muscles were collected for meat quality assessment and histopathological analysis. WH supplementation significantly improved (P < 0.05) body weight gain, feed conversion ratio (FCR), and meat quality in broilers. Compared to control and ciprofloxacin groups, WH-treated broilers exhibited lower cooking and drip loss (P < 0.05), higher water-holding capacity (P < 0.01), and reduced shear force value (P < 0.05), indicating improved texture. Ciprofloxacin treatment resulted in reduced redness (P < 0.001) and increased yellowness (P < 0.01), while lightness remained unchanged across groups. Histological analysis revealed greater perimysium thickness and intermuscular adipose infiltration in WH-treated broilers, suggesting enhanced muscle structure.

It also induced MPs oxidation and aggregation, reflected by elevated carbonyl content, turbidity, zeta potential, and particle size. MPs structural alterations were confirmed by fluorescence quenching and increased exposure of hydrophobic groups. Correlation analysis revealed strong associations between physicochemical changes and MPs oxidation. Metabolomic analysis identified 161 and 105 differential metabolites in the CON vs. LS and CON vs. SS comparisons, respectively, involving 25 metabolic pathways related to energy, amino acids, and fatty acids. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular pathways of AHS-induced meat quality deterioration and reveal potential intervention timing for the poultry industry."

Analysis demonstrated few storage period effects on lamb meat quality. Shear force was perceivably reduced after Week 1 (P < 0.001); myofibrillar protein solubility increased with storage period (P = 0.004); and purge (P < 0.001), cooking (P < 0.05), and drip loss (P < 0.05) show a reduction in water-holding capacity between Weeks 0-14. Intramuscular fat, crude protein, dry matter, total moisture, and sarcoplasmic protein solubility were not affected by storage period (P > 0.05). The packaging effects on meat quality were somewhat limited to PACK 3. Differences in water holding capacity was most apparent between PACK 1-2 and PACK 3-4, the latter having the highest amount of water loss (P < 0.05). TVC increased with storage period (P < 0.001), but remained > log 7 CFU/g for any treatment combination. TVB-N concentrations increased between Weeks 1-14 (P < 0.001), but remained > 15 mg/100 g. Lamb meat stored for > 6 weeks became unacceptably discoloured (based on a* and brownness indices) increasingly sooner into the 3 d retail display period. These findings support a longer shelf-life for chilled lamb meat."

Results indicated that the microbiota differed between the meat and contact surface, both across the two processing lines and within each individual processing line. Differences in the microbiota composition were also strongly associated with both the specific processing dates and the time of day during processing. Much of this variation was associated with distinct amplicon sequence variants unique to each processing date and each processing line throughout the day. The abundance of key taxa associated with food safety and spoilage was also temporally dynamic across a production shift and was different between the meat and contact surface. Overall, the results of this study indicate significant differences in the microbial profiles of the meat and contact surfaces between two processing lines within the same plant. These differences are likely influenced by daily variation in processing and sanitation procedures, as well as differences in the design of the processing lines, which appear to affect the microbiotas of both the meat and contact surfaces.IMPORTANCEThis study provides critical knowledge that can be used as a foundation for tailored processes to improve fresh pork safety and quality, potentially customized to individual processing lines, time points within a shift, and/or production days. Additionally, this study provides a list of potential biological markers associated with food safety and quality that could be used by processors to develop and validate intervention strategies specific to different processing lines.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of added fat 15%-16% (in form of pork fat, liquid oil or bigel structured with collagen and mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids), fibers (3.0%) in the form of lingonberry pomace and protein collagen (2.0%-3.0%) as well as interactions between them on the stability, the rheological and textural properties, the color and printing performance of meat-based ink formulations and its application in the dysphagia diet. Results showed that all samples exhibited shear-thinning behavior (the viscosity of a material decreases as the shear rate increases) with n < 1. Pork fat, fiber incorporation and increase in protein concentration affected the increase in apparent viscosity, consistency coefficient, elasticity and loss modulus values. Structured oil addition helped to create a more stable gel-like network (confirmed by higher elastic modulus G' and hardness values) that provided stability to the matrix by trapping inside the oil phase, affecting higher post-printing stability (> 98%) as well as stability after thermal treatment (80%-93%). Thermally treated samples with structured oil addition were selected and labeled as Level 6 (soft and bite-sized), as defined by the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) framework, suggesting that they suit people with mild dysphagia. The outcome of this study provides insights into how to tailor meat-based ink formulations to meet the needs of dysphagia patients.",

We address this question with a theoretical review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that measured MAP consumption at least one day after intervention. We meta-analyze 35 papers comprising 41 studies, 112 interventions, and approximately 87,000 subjects. We find that these papers employ four major strategies to change behavior: choice architecture, persuasion, psychology, and a combination of persuasion and psychology. The pooled effect of all 112 interventions on MAP consumption is quite small (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.07 (95% CI: [0.02, 0.12]), indicating an unsolved problem. Interventions aiming to reduce only consumption of red and processed meat were more effective (SMD = 0.25; 95% CI: [0.11, 0.38]), but it remains unclear whether such interventions also decrease consumption of other forms of MAP. We conclude that while existing approaches do not provide a proven remedy to MAP consumption, designs and measurement strategies have generally been improving over time, and many promising interventions await rigorous evaluation."

      "abstract": "The chicken's gastrointestinal tract is home to complex and diverse microbial communities that can be manipulated to enhance health and productivity. Although polyphenols have recently attracted the attention of researchers due to their potent antioxidant capabilities, their impact on the gut microbiota remains largely unexplored. Hence, in this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the effects of dietary supplementation with polyphenol-rich extract from shredded, steam-exploded pine particles (PSPP) on growth, meat quality, and gut microbial dynamics in broiler chickens. Supplementation of PSPP was found to significantly improve birds' FCR until the third week of the trial but only marginally affected meat quality. Based on metataxonomic analyses of the cecal microbiotas of broilers fed increasing concentrations of PSPP, dietary PSPP modulated the composition of the cecal microbiota of the birds with a concomitant increase of Bacteroidetes and a decrease in the Firmicutes population. Similar trends were observed for the proportions of Alistipes and Faecalibacterium at the genus level. Additionally, 43 unique bacterial species were detected in the cecal microbiome of birds fed with PSPP. However, microbial diversity did not vary significantly among treatment groups. A particularly interesting finding was the specialization observed in the microbiome of birds receiving PSPP supplementation. Microbial co-occurrence network analyses revealed substantial modifications in their network structure when compared to control birds. Families like Rikenellaceae and Eubacteriaceae were notably absent, and the number of microbial interactions was drastically lower in the PSPP-fed group. Microbial taxa modeling revealed that the impact of increasing dietary PSPP levels primarily affected genus-level taxa, showing a decreasing trend. Overall, this offers compelling evidence that continuous PSPP supplementation may not only alter the composition of intestinal microbes but also have a profound effect on the interactions among different microbial species. Conversely, PSPP had minimal effects on broilers' performance and meat quality."

The impact of various treatments on irradiated chicken patties was evaluated on physicochemical properties, storage stability analysis, peroxide value (POV), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) by varying storage intervals (0, 7, and 14 days) at freezing temperature (-5°C). The results showed that the gamma irradiated samples (4 kGy) led to a substantial decrease in the microbiological load in SPP added treated samples (T5: 4 kGy + 3%SPP>T4:2 kGy 3% SPP>T2: 4 kGy) as compared to control. Other parameters including heme pigment, hunter's color value, POV, TBARS, and TVBN also varied among various treatments and storage intervals significantly (p < 0.05). The highest POV and TBARS with irradiation (4 kGy) observed in T1 was 0.46 ± 0.04 meq peroxide/kg and 0.68 ± 0.12 MDA/kg, respectively, at 14th day of storage. While the highest POV (0.55 ± 0.09 meq peroxide/kg) was observed in T4 treatment samples with 4 kGy + 3% SPP. Total phenolic content and antioxidant potential (DPPH) were also observed to be higher in treated samples (T5 59.41% ± 0.03%; T4 63.7 ± 0.05bmg/g GAE respectively) as compared to control groups during storage. Conclusively, study results confirmed that the sweet lime peel powder extracts encapsulation combined with gamma irradiation resulted in improved physiochemical and antioxidant characteristics along with microbial quality of chicken meat patties during storage at freezing temperature."

A total of 30 Fleckvieh bulls (average initial weight 441 kg; SD = 33 kg) were housed under identical conditions and fed ad libitum diets similar in protein and energy contents, but with different protein sources-YL seed meal (70 g/kg DM), WL seed meal (77 g/kg DM), and RS meal (75 g/kg DM)-for an average of 85 days. The RS bulls gained weight more rapidly (p < 0.05) and were more efficient (lower feed to gain ratio; p < 0.001) than the YL animals, with the WL group being intermediary. The slaughter and carcass traits, most blood parameters, and meat quality attributes measured in two different muscles were not affected by diet. The proportions and contents of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were higher in YL and WL meat (p < 0.001), whilst polyunsaturated fatty acid proportions were higher in RS meat (p < 0.001). Several meat texture characteristics were slightly more favourable in the YL samples compared to the other treatment groups. In conclusion, WL could be used as a replacement of RS in the diets for finishing bulls. However, further research is needed to examine different varieties and inclusion levels of YL in cattle feeding."

As a foodborne illness, it also poses a public health risk due to potential cross-contamination. Probiotics have been proposed as alternative feed additives aiming to enhance growth, livestock productivity, and overall health. This study investigated the dietary impact of Lactococcus lactis JNU 534 on growth performance, blood characteristics, internal organ weight, and meat quality in broilers inoculated with Salmonella enteritidis (SE). A total of 96 one-day-old Arbor Acres broiler chickens, comprising both sexes, were challenged with SE and randomly assigned into two treatment groups and housed in eight pens (four pens per each treatment, with 12 birds per pen). They were fed a commercial broiler diet for 35 days. The two dietary treatment groups consisted of a control group receiving commercial feed, and a treatment group receiving commercial feed supplemented with 0.3% L. lactis JNU 534. Probiotic supplementation significantly improved average body weight gain, feed efficiency, and carcass yield compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Notably, the abdominal fat pad was significantly reduced in the probiotics group (p < 0.05). Meat quality assessments revealed no significant differences between the groups in terms of meat pH, cooking loss, drip loss, and water-holding capacity. These findings suggest that L. lactis JNU 534 is a promising candidate to mitigate the negative effects of Salmonella on growth performance in commercial broiler farms, without adversely affecting health. Extending the research to other types of livestock could help confirm its wider use as an alternative to antibiotics."

In this study, 40 Huanghuai male goats, weighing 30 ± 0.5 kg at six months of age, were selected and randomly divided into four treatments: ginger straw 0% (G0), 5% (G5), 10% (G10) and 20% (G20) replacing peanut straw, with 10 goats in each treatment. Goat dry matter intake (DMI) improved as the proportion of peanut straws replaced with ginger straws increased (linear, P < 0.001, quadratic, P < 0.001). The highest average daily gain (ADG) and the lowest feed-to-gain ratio (F/G) were observed in G5 goats (P < 0.001). The digestibilities of neutral detergent fibre (NDF, P = 0.031) and acid detergent fibre (ADF, P = 0.014) were higher in the G5 group than in G10 and G20. With increasing ginger straw replacement, the plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels increased (linear, P = 0.035, quadratic, P = 0.041). The microbial protein (MCP) increased as the proportion of ginger straw increased (linear, P = 0.034, quadratic, P = 0.041). The butyrate was increased (linear, P = 0.028, quadratic, P = 0.035) at all levels of ginger straw inclusion into the diet. A linear (P < 0.001) increase in the height of the jejunal mucosal villi was observed as the proportion of ginger straw in the diet increased. The tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) and claudin-1 mRNA expression in the jejunal mucosa were significantly higher in groups G5, G10, and G20 than in the G0 group (P < 0.001). In general, substituting peanut straw with ginger straw in goat diets promoted rumen fermentation and produced more volatile fatty acids and microbial proteins to meet the needs of goats for improved growth performance. Substituting ginger straw for peanut straw improved immunity and the intestinal barrier in goats and did not adversely affect meat quality. Replacing peanut straw with 5% ginger straw in the goat diet resulted in higher NDF digestibility and growth performance. Therefore, the replacement of peanut straw with 5% ginger straw in goat diets is recommended."

The results showed that either HPH or heat-treatment modified CP exhibited a considerable improvement in emulsion stability, textural attributes (hardness, cohesiveness, and chewiness), and b⁎ values (P < 0.05), promoted the formation of inorganic and organic sulfide compounds, and enhanced the umami, richness, and saltiness of RPMEs. Moreover, HPH + heat-treatment dual-modified CP showed superior enhancement effects on most technofunctional properties, thereby imparting the meat emulsion with quality characteristics comparable with high-phosphate control (0.4 % STPP, w/w). Hierarchical cluster analysis and partial least squares regression analysis suggested that the changes in technofunctional traits of RPMEs containing modified CP could be associated with rheological and structural modifications in meat emulsions. Theses alterations included enhanced viscoelasticity, elevated stabilization of internal water, reinforced aliphatic-residue hydrophobic interactions, strengthened intermolecular hydrogen and disulfide bonding, the uncoiling of α-helices concurrent with the formation of β-sheets and random coils, and an increased fractal dimension and decreased porosity of the gel networks. Therefore, HPH combined with heat-treatment modified CP is an intriguing phosphate substitute for developing reduced-phosphate meat products."

Most of the meat samples showed saturated MOH (MOSH) in a carbon chain length range that could have accumulated by the animals. However, the highest contamination found in two beef rib samples occurred probably during slaughter or handling prior to commercialization. This was suggested by the MOSH profile (i.e. high molecular weight), the presence of aromatic MOH (MOAH), hopanes and alkylbenzenes. The primary type of MOSH found in the meat was generally paraffins, and the MOAH in beef ribs were exclusively composed of 1-2 ring compounds.

The Texture Profile Analysis (hardness, springiness, gumminess, chewiness) and Extended Craft Knife parameters (firmness and work of shear) in the meat samples significantly decreased (p < 0.05) following the combined treatment of marination and SVT. The study identified zingibain, an enzyme found in ginger, as the most effective for tenderizing beef (p < 0.05). In contrast, actinidin, the enzyme present in kiwi, was found to be the most effective for tenderizing goose and rabbit meats. The microstructural analysis showed significantly larger spaces between muscle fibers in the treated meats compared to the control samples. The combination of plant protease and SVT significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the microorganism count in the meats and received higher texture scores from the panelists (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the purees did not cause any sensory defects."

      "abstract": "The objective of the study was to determine the effect of sex, season, and breed on creatine kinase (CK) levels, carcass, and the physicochemical properties of village chickens slaughtered using the transverse neck incision (TNI). One hundred chickens were stratified based on sex, breed, and season and were randomly assigned to different treatment groups to assess their live weight, carcass weight, meat quality, and CK levels. Results indicated that sex influenced live and carcass weights, with cocks (P < 0.05) being heavier than hens. Seasonal variations had a more significant effect on weights and meat quality, with the hot-dry season yielding the highest (P < 0.05) weights and the rainy season the lowest (P < 0.05). Seasonal changes also affected (P < 0.05) pH, meat colour, cooking loss, and drip loss, creatine kinase levels. The Leghorn chickens exhibited the highest (P < 0.05) live weight, and the Australorp had the lowest (P < 0.05). The Orpington breed produced the firmest meat (P < 0.05), whereas the Australorp yielded the tenderest. The study suggests that season and genetic factors significantly influence meat quality in village chickens. Further research is recommended into the nutritional status and muscle fibre composition to enhance meat quality. These findings offer valuable insights for improving slaughter practices and meat production in resource-limited farming systems.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different exogenous additives, specifically sodium tripolyphosphate and lysine, on the quality of chicken breast meat in canned assorted vegetables and diced chicken using different curing methods: static curing, ultrasonic curing, vacuum tumbling curing, and ultrasonic combined with vacuum tumbling curing. The texture, moisture mobility and distribution, microstructure, and sensory acceptability of the chicken meat were evaluated. The results showed that lysine demonstrates better water retention than sodium tripolyphosphate, combining ultrasonic and vacuum tumbling treatments with 0.2% Lys (SL-UVT) significantly enhanced the texture characteristics and reduced the cooking loss of chicken breast meat. Additionally, SL-UVT treatment improved the texture, appearance, flavor, and overall acceptability scores. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis showed that SL-UVT treatment affected water distribution and flowability, increasing the retention of less mobile water in chicken breasts. In addition, the gap between myogenic fibers increased after SL-UVT treatment, trapping more water. In conclusion, SL-UVT treatment significantly improved the tenderness and water-holding capacity of the chicken breast from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. This study provided a theoretical foundation for refining and optimizing canned meat processing techniques.",

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to evaluate a blend of yeast and saccharides based-product fed via diet to feedlot cattle on performance, health, meat quality, and rumen metabolism when compared to monensin. Twenty-four non-castrated crossbred male steers (Charolais x Nellore) were divided into control (n = 12), receiving the basal diet with monensin (215 mg/animal/day) and treatment (n = 12) receiving the basal diet with the blend of yeast and saccharides based-product (17.2 g/animal/day). Animals were weighed on days 1, 20, and 113, and on days 20, 70, and 113, blood and rumen fluid were collected, which was also used to determine the genera of bacteria present in the rumen and to quantify protozoa. Total feces were collected to determine apparent total tract digestibility from days 108 to 112 of the experiment. There was no treatment effect for weight gain, feed intake, or feed efficiency. There was a gain in the loin eye area in the control group (P = 0.05) and greater subcutaneous fat thickness in the loin and rump cap control group (P = 0.01). In the ruminal fluid, there was higher protozoa count in the treatment group on day 113 (P = 0.03) and a higher proportion of propionic acid in the treatment group on day 70 (P = 0.03). Total short-chain fatty acids were lower in steers in the treatment group. There was no treatment effect on the ruminal microbiota. There were lower counts of lymphocytes and granulocytes in the blood of steer in the treatment group (P < 0,05). A significant increase in the concentrations of immunoglobin A (IgA) and others heavy-chain immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, IgM and IgE) were observed in the treatment group. There was an effect of treatment on glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity on days 70 and 113 (P = 0.02). Likewise, high GST activity in the liver was identified in the treatment group (P = 0.01). For fatty acid profile in meat, oleic acid presented higher proportion in the treatment group (P = 0.04), in contrast to docis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid, which was lower in the same group (P = 0.05). It is concluded that the blend of yeast and saccharides based-product played a role similar to monensin's in productive performance, demonstrating a potential to substitute monensin. Furthermore, the inclusion of yeast and saccharides in the diet stimulated the humoral immune response and antioxidant action without affecting meat quality.",

The gut microbiota produces TMAO from substrates mainly found in red meat, eggs, and dairy. However, some saltwater fish also contain high levels of TMAO. Although fish consumption is generally linked to beneficial effects, its effects on CKD patients require further research. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study compares the effect of red meat and cod fish intake on TMAO plasma levels in CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Participants received a single animal protein source (red meat vs. cod fish) for lunch and dinner for four consecutive days (each intervention), with a 2-week washout period in between. TMAO plasma levels were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. All 14 patients concluded the red meat intervention, while one refused to participate in the fish intervention. No significant difference in TMAO plasma levels was found post-red meat (p = 0.21) or fish intervention (p = 0.91), as well as between groups (p = 0.43). CONCLUSION: In this study, 4 days of red meat and cod fish intake did not significantly impact TMAO levels in HD patients, while other factors may be associated with their circulating levels.",

A total of 90 pigs (99.60 ± 1.63 kg) were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group fed a commercial diet (CN), and two treatment groups fed 100 (AC1) and 300 (AC2) g/kg of acorns, respectively. Each group contained five replicates with six pigs per replicate. After a 120-day treatment period, the AC2 group showed significantly higher pH24h, a*, intramuscular fat, and umami amino acid and significantly lower L*, cooking loss, and shear force than the CN group (p < 0.05). Further, the AC2 group showed significantly increased glycogen, ATP, and ADP, creatine kinase activity, and myofiber density and significantly decreased glycolytic potential, lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase muscle, and pyruvate kinase activities (p < 0.05). The mRNA levels of MYH7, MYH2, and MYH1 were significantly upregulated in the AC2 group (p < 0.05). A transcriptome analysis further revealed significant differences in gene expression patterns between the AC2 and CN groups. These findings suggest that dietary acorns at 300 g/kg improve pork quality by inducing the conversion of myofiber types and regulating glycolysis."

This study aimed to enhance the productivity of cultivated meat through optimization of the cell source and organization process. RESULTS: We engineered fibroblasts into myogenic cells via non-viral introduction of the MYOD1 gene, avoiding viral methods for safety. After confirming the stable derivation of myogenic cells, we combined knockout (KO) of MSTN, a negative regulator of myogenesis, with MYOD1-mediated myogenesis to improve cultivated meat production. Primary cells from MSTN KO cattle exhibited enhanced myogenic potential. Additionally, when tested in immortalized fibroblasts, myostatin treatment reduced MYOD1-induced myogenesis in two-dimensional cultures, while MSTN knockout increased it. To achieve muscle-like cell alignment, we employed digital light processing (DLP)-based three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting to organize cells into 3D groove-shaped hydrogels. These bioactive hydrogels supported stable cell proliferation and significantly improved muscle cell alignment. Upon differentiation into myotubes, the cells demonstrated an ordered alignment, particularly the MSTN KO cells, which showed highly efficient differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of genetic modification and advanced DLP 3D bioprinting with groove-patterned hydrogels provides an effective strategy for producing high-quality, muscle-aligned cultivated meat."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutrient deficiency globally. There is increasing interest in the use of food-based approaches for improving and maintaining iron status. OBJECTIVE: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify, critically-appraise, and meta-analyze data from intervention studies that investigated the effect of increasing red meat intake on iron status in adults. DATA EXTRACTION: The search was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar databases, as well as other supplementary search strategies up to October 2024. Inclusion criteria for reviewed articles were participants who were adults aged 18 to 70 years, interventions that involved ≥4 weeks of increased red meat intake, included a suitable control condition, and measured at least 1 biomarker of iron status. The initial search yielded 5212 articles, with 10 articles (n = 397 participants) meeting the inclusion criteria. DATA ANALYSIS: The effect of intervention on markers of iron status were analyzed using a meta-analytic multivariate model, and the potential moderating effect of multiple variables were considered. The final meta-analysis included 42 effects (k) for serum ferritin (k = 25) and hemoglobin (Hb; k = 17) concentrations. Interventions involving increasing red meat intake had no significant effect on serum ferritin concentrations (raw mean change difference [RMCD] = 1.87 μg L-1; 95% CI, -0.73 to 4.48; t = 1.619; P = .139) but did have a positive effect on Hb concentrations (RMCD = 2.36 g L-1; 95% CI, 0.71 to 4.02; t = 3.297; P = .011). Moderator analysis revealed a positive effect of increasing red meat intake on serum ferritin concentrations when the intervention lasted at least 8 weeks (RMCD = 2.27 μg L-1; 95% CI, 0.87 to 3.67), and longer than 16 weeks (RMCD = 5.62 μg L-1; 95% CI, 0.67 to 10.6). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing red meat intake can improve iron status as indicated by increases in serum ferritin and Hb concentrations, but the extent to which such increases are clinically meaningful remains to be established.

A total of 288 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Cobb500; initial BW: 37.2 g) were allotted to one of 3 dietary treatments: 1) a corn basal diet with conventional SBM (CSBM); 2) a corn basal diet with expeller-extruded conventional soybeans (EECS); 3) a corn basal diet with expeller-extruded high oleic soybeans (EEHS) in a randomized complete block design. Diets were fed over 3 phases (starter phase 1: 0-1 weeks, grower phase 2: 1-3 weeks, and finisher phase 3: 3-6 weeks). At the end of each feeding phase, BW and feed consumption were measured to calculate average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). At the end of the feeding trial (d 42), one bird per pen was bled for blood profile analysis, and two birds per pen were euthanized for breast and thigh collection. Data were subjected to analysis of variance testing the main effect of diet with pen as the experimental unit. Broilers fed the CSBM diet had greater (P < 0.05) BW at the end of each phase and overall ADG than those fed EECS and EEHS. Broilers fed EEHS showed greater (P < 0.05) final BW and overall ADG than EECS by 10.6 % and 10.7 %, respectively. The EEHS significantly increased (P < 0.05) blood basophil proportion compared with CSBM (15.7 % vs. 7.6 %). However, dietary treatment did not affect other blood cell count parameters and blood antioxidant status. Oleic acid contents for breast and thigh meats from broilers fed EEHS were higher (P < 0.05) than those of broilers fed CSBM and EECS by 63 % and 53 %, respectively. In conclusion, EEHS improved meat fatty acid composition with higher oleic acid contents and improved growth performance compared with EECS, suggesting its potential as a protein source for high quality broiler meat production.",

      "abstract": "Liver fluke infection in cattle is typically sub-clinical, with animals lacking in visible clinical signs. Consequently, farmers are often dubious about investing in control measures as they are often unaware of its deleterious effects on meat quality and weight gain. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of liver fluke infection on carcass weight and meat quality in Australian cattle, and, in turn, to estimate the economic loss to the producer. This study utilised abattoir data obtained from an Australian meat processor. The data encompassed observations of over 4 million cattle processed between 2016 and 2020. Six response variables were considered: the carcass weight, fat depth, AUS-MEAT marbling, muscle area, Meat Standards Australia index and ossification age days. The large volume of data, combined with a high degree of diversity in management practices and animals, meant accurate estimation of the effect of liver fluke infection was challenging. A generalised random forest model was used for heterogeneous causal effect estimation, while adjusting for relevant confounding variables and accounting for complex variable interactions. Substantive differences in the effect of liver fluke infection were found across groups of animals, with hormonal growth promotant free (HGP-free) animals sourced from properties being the most negatively impacted in terms of the carcass weight and meat quality. The expected loss for the producer per animal infected with liver fluke was estimated to be A$35 (95 % CI 26, 43) for Angus females and A$32 (95 % CI 24, 41) for Angus males (both HGP-free and sourced from properties). Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that cattle producers operating in high-risk regions carefully consider the relative benefits of liver fluke treatment and control.",

These parasites form cysts in the muscles of livestock, causing economic losses and health risks, including reduced meat and milk production, abortions, and, in severe cases, death in intermediate hosts. This study evaluates the antiparasitic effects of nitrate and lactic acid against Sarcocystis bradyzoites in sheep meat, aiming to identify effective decontamination methods to enhance food safety. Samples of Sarcocystis cysts were collected from infected sheep organs and treated with various concentrations (3%, 6%, 9%, and 12%) of nitrate and lactic acid for 3-48 h. Bradyzoite viability was assessed microscopically after staining and digestion. Additionally, bioassays were conducted using cats to confirm the treatment's efficacy. Results demonstrated that both compounds significantly increased bradyzoite mortality with higher concentrations and longer exposure times. Lactic acid showed greater efficacy at lower concentrations; 100% mortality was achieved at 3% lactic acid after 48 h and 6% after 24 h. In contrast, nitrate required 12% concentration for 100% mortality within 24 h. Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between compound concentration and exposure time with bradyzoite mortality, highlighting lactic acid's superior antiparasitic properties at lower concentrations compared with nitrate. This study highlights the potential of lactic acid and nitrate as natural decontamination agents for meat safety. Their application could mitigate Sarcocystis-related risks, reduce foodborne parasitic infections, and contribute to the economic sustainability of meat production."

      "abstract": "The objective of this meta-regression was to evaluate the influence of ruminant species, sex, and climatic regions on the metabolizable energy (ME) requirements for maintenance (MEm) and weight gain (MEg) in growing small ruminants raised for meat production across different climatic regions. Data included 655 and 337 treatment means from 173 and 99 studies on sheep and goats, respectively. Metabolizable energy intake (MEI; MJ/kg^0.75) was regressed against average daily gain (ADG; g/kg^0.75), with the study included as a random effect. The analysis found that MEm was not affected by species (P = 0.50), but MEg (MJ/g ADG) was significantly different between species (P = 0.02), with sheep requiring 0.032 (± 0.002) and goats 0.026 (± 0.002) MJ/g ADG. Sex did not affect MEm in either species (P ≥ 0.32). However, in goats, intact males had a greater MEg (P = 0.02) than females (0.030 ± 0.003 vs. 0.013 ± 0.006 MJ/g ADG). MEm was lower (P = 0.03) in small ruminants raised in subtropical regions (0.497 ± 0.046 MJ/kg^0.75) compared to those in semi-arid (0.600 ± 0.038 MJ/kg^0.75) and tended to be lower than those in arid regions (0.529 ± 0.050 MJ/kg^0.75). However, these differences disappeared when adjusting for maturity, diet composition, digestibility, or altitude. MEg was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in animals raised in arid regions (0.032 ± 0.006 MJ/g ADG) compared to those in Mediterranean (0.009 ± 0.004 MJ/g ADG) or semi-arid regions (0.009 ± 0.004 MJ/g ADG) after adjusting for diet composition and digestibility. Similarly, ruminants in Mediterranean regions had lower MEg (0.019 ± 0.004 and 0.009 ± 0.004 MJ/g ADG) than those in tropical regions (0.033 ± 0.002 and 0.024 ± 0.002 MJ/g ADG), respectively after adjusting for maturity, diet composition, and digestibility. MEg in semi-arid regions was consistently lower than in tropical regions, regardless of the covariates tested. For predictive purposes, the global model exhibited the best accuracy (CCC = 0.57 and RSR = 0.79), comparable to the model derived specifically for the tropical region (CCC = 0.58 and RSR = 0.80). This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of species-specific differences in ME requirements in small ruminants while recognizing the challenges posed by confounding effects and climatic variability inherent in global datasets. The analysis suggests that animals raised in tropical conditions may have lower MEm than current feeding systems that use data from temperate climates."

A chlorinated alkaline agent and a quaternary ammonium-based agent were evaluated for their ability to remove biofilms. The E. coli O157:H7 strain was a non-biofilm former. In dual-species biofilms, if the companion MPB did not produce detectable biofilm, then the pairing did not produce measurable biofilms either. The interaction effect between MPB and E. coli O157:H7 was predominantly no-effect (neutral). Among the four MPB isolates tested by viable cell enumeration method, only generic E. coli genotype 136 reduced viable numbers of E. coli O157:H7 in dual-strain biofilm. Sequential treatment with cleaning and sanitizing treatment provided a better removal of biofilm than a single-agent treatment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess the feasibility of incorporating food-grade zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) for making zinc-fortified meatballs from broiler meat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 20 broiler breasts were treated with different concentrations of elemental zinc (Zn) of food-grade ZnSO₄ for making meatballs. The study included a control group without added Zn (T0: 0 mg/kg) and treatment groups with Zn concentrations of 10 mg/kg (T1), 20 mg/kg (T2), 30 mg/kg (T3), and 40 mg/kg (T4). Post-cooking, the meatball samples underwent preservation at -20°C for proximate composition, quality parameters, storage quality, texture, and sensory analysis. RESULTS: Though the moisture content of meatballs did not differ significantly (p > 0.05), the T4 meatballs showed higher moisture percentages and significantly (p < 0.01) higher crude protein content compared to the control. However, a significant increase in cook yield (p < 0.01) and water-holding capacity (p < 0.05) were revealed by the T4 group. The T4 meatball recovered around 41.8% Zn. The malondialdehyde levels in all samples were acceptable when kept in the chiller for ten days. Moreover, the addition of varying doses of ZnSO4 did not result in a significant alteration (p > 0.05) in the hardness of the meatballs. The sensory panelists also validated the instrumental outcome of hardness. CONCLUSION: The addition of 40 mg/kg of elemental Zn from ZnSO4 improves nutritional composition and quality with no alteration of the texture and sensory properties of the meatball. This dose could be an effective strategy for fortifying chicken meat products and could offer a valuable source of dietary Zn for human consumption."

Some of the by-products are rich in bioactive compounds that could lead to an increase in the quality of animal meat products. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary incorporation of grape pomace (GP), a by-product rich in polyphenols, on growth and on the oxidation status and the fatty acid profile of rabbit meat. Forty-eight male rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) (aged 55 ± 3 d and ca 2.3 kg) divided into three groups of 16 were used in the trial. The rabbits were housed in pairs in wire-mesh cages (26 × 46 × 35 cm) giving n = 8 for each diet treatment. The first group was fed a basal diet (CTR) (ca 18% protein and ca 4% fat), the second was given a basal diet supplemented with 5 g GP per head per day (low-GP) and the third group was fed a basal diet supplemented with 10 g GP per head per day (high-GP). The trial lasted three weeks, and the animals were weighed weekly. The rabbits were slaughtered, and the weight and the pH of the carcasses was measured immediately after slaughter and after 24 h of cooling at 4 °C. The pH of the stomach and cecum was measured. A sample of Longissimus Dorsi (LD) was collected and stored at -80 °C for the analysis of proximate composition, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) and fatty acid profile (FA). The diet did not influence the growth or the pH of the stomach and cecum of the rabbits. The chemical composition of the meat was similar in all groups, with a mean protein of 22.3% and fat of 0.95%. The fatty acid profiles of the LD were not influenced by the diet, and the most abundant FAs were C16:0, C18:2n6 and C18:1c9. Feeding GP to the rabbits gave a linear decrease of TBARs in the meat, indicating a reduction in oxidative stress. The TBARs' reduction was 60% in the meat of the rabbits given high-GP compared to CTR. In conclusion, GP could be used in rabbit diets without any negative influence on meat quality but with an increase in oxidation stability that could enhance meat shelf-life."

      "abstract": "Ferulic acid is an antimicrobial and antioxidant phenolic compound located in the cell walls of plants and therefore classified as a natural antioxidant. The objective of this study was to assess the antimicrobial and antioxidant potential of ferulic acid as a substitute for nitrites in the elaboration of dried meat. Four treatments were evaluated: dried meat without nitrites or ferulic acid, (control treatment), dried meat with nitrites, dried meat with 0.05% of ferulic acid, and dried meat with 0.1% of ferulic acid. The antioxidant activity, lipid oxidation, and microbiological quality were evaluated throughout the dried meat shelf life. The protein, fat, and ash content was not different between the treatments with nitrites and ferulic acid (p > 0.05) and all values were within the ranges established for these nutrients. Regarding the moisture content, although there was a difference between treatments (p < 0.05), the values found were within the reported range (5-15%) in dried meat. Treatment with nitrites had the highest sodium content (p < 0.05), although all treatments surpass the daily consumption of sodium recommended by the World Health Organization. In addition, color differences would not be noticeable to the human eye. Treatments with ferulic acid exhibited the highest (p < 0.05) antioxidant activity and the lowest lipid oxidation and total aerobic mesophile counts. Finally, the change in the formulation of dried meat using ferulic acid instead of nitrites was not perceptible to panelists in sensory evaluation. These findings suggest that the incorporation of ferulic acid, when added to dried meat, can improve its oxidative stability and increase its antioxidant activity. In conclusion, the use of ferulic acid at a concentration of 0.1% is recommended because, at this concentration, the antioxidant activity was greater, and the oxidation was below the threshold of perceived rancidity. However, further research is needed to study the effect of nitrite substitution using ferulic acid in combination with other potential natural antioxidants."

In total, 60 Hu lambs (two months old and weighing 17.32 ± 0.81 kg) were randomly assigned to four treatment groups, each with three replicates and five lambs per replicate. The lambs were fed basal diets supplemented with 0, 1.5, 3, or 4.5 g/kg XOSs in a basal diet for 60 days, with the groups designated XOS0%, XOS1.5%, XOS3%, and XOS4.5%, respectively. The results revealed, compared to theXOS0% group, the XOS3% group presented a lower F:G during 31 to 45 d (p = 0.06). By the 60th day, the body length indices of groups XOS3% and XOS4.5% increased compared to the XOS0% group, with a significant increase observed in group XOS4.5% (p < 0.05). Additionally, the GR values of the XOS1.5%, XOS3%, and XOS4.5% groups increased significantly, and the rumen fluid pH values of the XOS3% and XOS4.5% groups increased significantly (p < 0.01). The crude fat content in the XOS1.5% and XOS4.5% groups were significantly lower (p < 0.05). The hardness, adhesiveness, elasticity, cohesiveness, and chewiness of the mutton in the XOS1.5%, XOS3%, and XOS4.5% groups were increased, although the differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis indicates that there is a significant correlation between growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality (p < 0.05). The factors influencing meat quality originate from the growth period and the slaughtering phase, which can be attributed to the effects of xylooligosaccharides. In conclusion, XOS had positive effects on the growth performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of Hu lambs. The comprehensive effect of group XOS3% was best. Considering the production cost, the 3 g/kg XOSs is identified as the optimal supplementation level for sheep."

Mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds formed by heating in protein-rich food include, among others, heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs). Modifying the heat treatment of meat and using natural additives with antioxidant properties can lead to a reduction in their formation. The aim of this study was to determine polar HAAs (imidazoquinolines, IQ and MeIQ; imidazoquinoxalines, 8-MeIQx and 4,8-DiMeIQx; and phenylimidazopyridine, PhIP) in pork loin prepared without additives and with three types of dried fruit (apricots, cranberries, and prunes), baked in a roasting bag. HAAs were isolated from meat samples by solid-phase extraction. Quantitative analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (FLD) and a diode array detector (DAD). Only two HAAs, 8-MeIQx and PhIP, were detected in extracts isolated from meat samples. The total content of these compounds in meat roasted without additives was 5.9 ng/g. Using a dried fruit stuffing content of 200 g/kg of meat reduced these concentrations in dishes prepared with prunes, apricots, and cranberries by 42%, 47%, and 77%, respectively."

      "abstract": "A novel direct lysis method combined with amplification-free CRISPR/Cas12a-SERS genosensor was for the first time developed to rapidly and sensitively identify meat adulteration. Notably, polystyrene (PS) microspheres, with distinct shrinking and swelling properties, were dexterously employed to encapsulate biological-silent Raman reporter 4-mercaptobenzonitrile (4-MBN) and act as a controlled-release signal probe. Target DNA activated the trans-cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas12a towards ssDNA linked with PS microsphere to liberate the signal probe, which was able to release numerous Raman reporters after treatment with THF solution, resulting in high signal amplification. Through this platform, trace target DNA was deftly transformed into a sensitive Raman signal and could be on-site determined through a portable Raman equipment. Under optimized conditions, this strategy displayed good linearity in the range 1-450 ng/μL (R2 = 0.9943) and favorable sensitivity with limit of detection as low as 0.23 ng/μL without any pre-amplification. Moreover, it exhibited good applicability to on-site identification of commercial meat samples in complicated food matrix. In addition, DNA extraction by direct lysis and amplification-free detection realized ultrafast meat adulteration determination within 35 min from sampling to result. This method possessed great potential in rapid and on-site accurate determination of meat authenticity.",

      "abstract": "Ozone nanobubbles represent an environmentally friendly sanitation agent. In this study, we compared the bactericidal effect of ozone nanobubbles on pork muscle and adipose tissue to peracetic acid treatments. Pork samples were surface-inoculated with a cocktail of common meat-spoilage-associated microorganisms composed of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Latilactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc gelidum, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Hafnia paralvei and Yersinia rohdei at a viable cell count of 102 CFU/cm2 or 104 CFU/cm2. Both freshly inoculated and stored pork samples were treated with the two sanitation agents, followed by differential enumeration of viable bacteria. Ozone nanobubbles were comparable to peracetic acid solution, achieving a reduction between 1 and 2 log (CFU/cm2), regardless of the initial inoculum concentration and sample type. The efficacy of ozone nanobubble increased with increased solution volume and flow rate. Moreover, the sanitizing agents differentially impacted the members of the microbiota and shifted the composition of tested strains during storage. Gram-negative Y. rohdei and H. paralvei were more sensitive to peracetic acid than Gram-positive strains. Microbial profiling using 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis of samples that were treated at a commercial processing scale revealed that Serratia, Carnobacterium, Yersinia, Vagococcus, Morganella, Dellaglioa were the dominant taxa (relative abundance >1 %) on stored pork samples. The use of ozone nanobubbles significantly reduced the relative abundance of Vagococcus and Clostridium when compared to control samples. In summary, ozone nanobubbles are an effective tool to reduce bacterial counts on meat and show promise to extend the shelf life of fresh meat.",

It was found that ultrasound, AMP, and their combined application significantly reduced the shear force of CWB (p < 0.05), effectively improving its tenderness. The combined treatment of ultrasound and AMP significantly decreased the filtering residues of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) and increased myofibrillar fragmentation index (p < 0.05). MPs structure analysis showed that the combined ultrasound and AMP treatment facilitated the degradation of tropomyosin, the transformation of α-helix into β-sheet, and decreased intensity of tryptophan fluorescence, promoting MPs degradation and improving CWB tenderness. Pathological analysis and scanning electron microscopy also observed muscle fiber damage and the loss of myofibrillar membrane integrity following the combined treatment.

Results of amino acid, vitamin, and mineral analysis of drone pupae revealed the presence of branched-chain amino acids, Glu, essential amino acids, vitamins B6, C and Mg, K, and so on. Additionally, drone pupae were shown to have an antioxidant ability. HSC were cultured for proliferation by adding 0, 10, 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL DEP to the medium. As a result of MTS analysis, DEP increased the proliferation capacity of HSC, with cell viability being significantly higher after treatment with DEP, especially when DEP was used at 100 μg/mL (p < 0.05). To measure the differentiation ability of HSC, 0 and 100 μg/mL DEP (CON, D100) were added to the medium, and cells were cultured. Myotube formation was confirmed through images using immunofluorescence staining. Fusion index and myotube area in the D100 were higher than those in the CON (p < 0.01). DEP promoted differentiation ability and myotube formation by increasing the expression of MYH2, MYOG, and DES genes and MYH2 and DES proteins in HSC. Additionally, in HSC differentiation culture, proteome expression intensity was higher in D100 than in CON. Proteins upregulated in the D100 group included Myosin, IL18, MYO1D, and so on. In conclusion, characteristics of various components present in DEP could improve the proliferation and differentiation ability of HSC. This suggests that drone pupae can be used as a functional substance to enhance muscle growth."

In total, 90 pigs [(Yorkshire × Landrace) × Duroc] were erratically dispensed to 3 treatments (6 replicate/treatment) with 5 pigs (3 barrows and 2 gilts) per pen, and their average primary body weight was 20.51± 0.02 kg. The trial period was 16 weeks (growing stage, initial to week 8; finishing stage, week 8 to week 16). The dietary treatments used included control (CON) as the basal diet, TRT1 (basal diet + 0.05% SID lysine), and TRT2 (basal diet + 0.05% SID lysine + 0.084 MJ/kg net energy) for both the growing and finishing stages. Both the TRT1 and TRT2 group diets improved (p = 0.033) average daily gain (ADG) at week 12 and tended to enhance (p = 0.088) body weight at week 12 and ADG at the overall period compared to the CON group. Moreover, pigs in the TRT2 group had higher backfat thickness (p = 0.034) at week 12 in comparison to the TRT1 and CON diets. Nevertheless, no treatment effect was found (p > 0.05) in nutrient absorption or carcass grade among the dietary treatments. Hence, incorporating the increasing level of 0.05% SID lysine and 0.084 MJ/kg net energy into the pig diet during the growing and finishing stages can be considered a suitable approach for enhancing both growth efficiency and carcass backfat thickness in pigs."

      "abstract": "Grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) is a type of plant polyphenol with a wide variety of biological activities, such as antioxidant properties. This study investigated the effects of GSP supplementation on growth performance and meat quality in growing-finishing pigs. A total of 180 pigs (with an initial average body weight of 30.37 ± 0.66 kg) were randomly assigned to five treatments: a control diet or a control diet supplemented with GSP at 15, 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg. Each treatment group comprised six replicate pens (6 pigs per pen). Results showed that GSP supplementation linearly increased the average daily gain (P = 0.048) and quadratically decreased the feed intake to gain ratio (P = 0.049) with the lowest values at 30 and 60 mg/kg GSP. Serum concentrations of immunoglobulins (Ig) (IgA, IgG, IgM), total antioxidative capacity, catalase, and total superoxide dismutase were elevated with the peak levels at 30 mg/kg GSP (P < 0.05). Serum glutathione peroxidase increased and malondialdehyde decreased quadratically (P < 0.05), with peak and trough levels at 120 and 60 mg/kg GSP, respectively. The GSP also improved dressing percentage and muscle redness (a∗45 min) with optimal levels at 30 and 60 mg/kg (P < 0.05). Additionally, GSP supplementation quadratically reduced the muscle yellowness (b∗24 h) and shear force (P < 0.05), with the lowest values at 120 mg/kg. The expression level of myosin heavy chain I in muscle was quadratically increased with maximum expression at 30 and 60 mg/kg (P = 0.015). Furthermore, the expression levels of fatty acid synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and glucokinase in the muscle were decreased quadratically (P < 0.05) with the lowest values at 120 mg/kg. Additionally, GSP supplementation at 60 mg/kg upregulated the expression of hepatic hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase and PEPCK (P < 0.05). These results suggest that GSP enhances carcass characteristics and meat quality in growing-finishing pigs, potentially through improved antioxidative capacity, modified muscle fiber type distribution, and altered glucose-lipid metabolism in muscle and liver."

This research aimed to study Salmonella spp contamination and its antibiotic resistance in turkey meat in Isfahan province, Iran.400 samples were collected from the turkey meat in slaughter line (May 2021 to May 2022). The conventional microbiological and biochemical tests were applied for isolation and typing of Salmonella spp. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized for detection and typing of Salmonella strains. The antibiotic sensitivity test was achieved and all strains were evaluated for resistance genes of Act (3)-IV, Sul1 and qnrA. In microbiological examination, 32 Salmonella strains (8 %) were identified. All tested strains were positive for invA gene. By amplifying the FlicC and Prot6E genes, 28 and 4 strains had genes related to enteritidis and typhimurium, respectively. In disc diffusion test, the highest antibiotic resistance was to oxytetracycline (50 %) and the lowest was to gentamicin, amoxiclavulanic acid, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. The results showed that 6 (18.75 %) and 10 (31.25 %) of the Salmonella spp were able to amplify Sul1 and qnrA genes, respectively. No Salmonella strain could amplify Act (3)-IV gene. 100 % of the strains carried the Sul1 and qnrA genes were resistant to sulfonamide, and enrofloxacin. Furthermore, 3 sulfonamide resistant strains (75 %) and 5 enrofloxacin resistant strains (83.33 %) were harbored Sul1 and qnrA genes, respectively. The prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella spp in turkey meat can induce health risk concern. However, the wide spectrum antibiotic resistance complicates the proper treatment of Salmonella infection in human."

The impact of different treatments-ultrasound combined with SAEW, SAEW alone, ultrasound combined with water, and water-alone treatment-on the freshness, texture, protein oxidation, and microbiological diversity of the meat was assessed under vacuum packaging at 4 °C. The results demonstrated that the ultrasound-SAEW combination significantly slowed pH decline, inhibited total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) formation, and preserved the redness (a*) and texture of duck breast meat. Additionally, carbonyl and total sulfhydryl measurements indicated that the combined treatment delayed protein oxidation. 16S rDNA analysis showed that combined treatment reduced the microbial abundance, particularly Pseudomonas and Candida. After 9 days of storage, the total viable count (TVC) of the treated duck breast meat remained within the GB 16869-2005 microbial contamination threshold for fresh meat (5.56 log10 CFU/g). These findings highlight the effectiveness of ultrasound-assisted SAEW in extending the shelf life and maintaining the quality of duck breast meat."

This study aimed to develop three patty prototypes (meat, hybrid, and plant-based) enhanced with vegetable fat replacement and broccoli extract using a soy allergen-free protein matrix treated with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and sous vide cooking to create sustainable and nutritious burger alternatives. The samples were evaluated for microbiological safety, proximal composition, physicochemical properties, sensory characteristics, and carbon footprint. The key findings revealed that the plant-based patties had the smallest carbon footprint (0.12 kg CO2e), followed by the hybrid patties (0.87 kg CO2e) and the meat patties (1.62 kg CO2e). The hybrid patties showed increased hardness, cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness compared to the meat patties after sous vide treatment. This improvement likely results from synergies between the meat and plant proteins. Regarding the treatments, in all the samples, the highest hardness was observed after the combined HHP and sous vide treatment, an interesting consideration for future prototypes. Sensory analysis indicated that the plant-based and hybrid samples maintained appealing visual and odour characteristics through the treatments, while the meat patties lost the evaluator's acceptance. Although further improvements in sensory attributes are needed, hybrid patties offer a promising balance of improved texture and intermediate carbon footprint, making them a viable alternative as sustainable, nutritious patties."

Water holding capacity (WHC) was highest (P < 0.05) in lambs fed the AMSVL, while shear force values were highest in lambs fed the UMS diet. The UMS diet obtained the highest amounts of SFAs. Nevertheless, the lambs in the AMSVL treatment obtained the highest (P < 0.05) proportions of total UFAs. Diet had no effect on PUFAs, PUFA/SFA and omega6/omega 3 ratios.

      "abstract": "The production and welfare of Pekin ducks can be affected by the lighting type they are housed under. There is no standard lighting system in industry and little data evaluating effects of different light systems on duck production and welfare. Pulsed Alternating Wavelength System (PAWS) is a novel LED technology that delivers multiple wavelengths of light in pulsating patterns. This study aimed to determine the effects of PAWS on brain serotonin turnover and skeletal quality in ducks. Ducks housed under PAWS were hypothesized to have lower brain serotonin turnover and equal bone quality compared to those housed under control lights (fluorescent with digital ballasts, 4500K, ∼40 lux). Ducks were placed in floor pens under PAWS or control lighting (1200 ducks/pen, n = 4 pens/treatment) at day of hatch until processing at 30 days of age (DOA). Body weights and feed intake were monitored weekly. Brains, femurs, tibiae, and humeri were collected on days 7, 14, 21 and 29 (n = 6 ducks/age/lighting type). Brain serotonin and metabolites were measured. Bone length, width, breaking strength, and ash were determined. Serotonin data were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA for age and lighting treatment with a post-hoc Fisher's LSD test. Bone data were analyzed with independent t-tests between treatments within each age. Ducks housed under PAWS were heavier by 29 DOA than controls (P < 0.001) with no differences in feed conversion. Brain analyses revealed no differences in serotonin turnover between lighting types. Early interstitial growth of PAWS femur and tibia was increased (P < 0.05), and PAWS femurs had increased bone mineral content at 29 DOA (P = 0.001). At 29 DOA, the PAWS humeri were wider than controls (P = 0.025) and had increased geometrical bone mechanical properties (P < 0.003), but no differences in breaking stress were evident. Results suggest that PAWS may have benefits for production traits and skeletal quality, however, a complete understanding of the welfare effects need further study.",

METHODS: 24 atopic dermatitis-affected pet dogs, all fed poultry meat and egg, and another 48 apparently healthy controls fed both poultry meat and egg (n = 24) or vegetable diet (24) were included in the study. The study was undertaken in the Bhubaneswar Smart City, Odisha, India, from July to December 2023. Fecal samples were collected at 2 points for DNA analysis, ie, on day 0 and day 60 of the change from a meat/egg-based diet to a vegetable-based diet. Extracted DNA samples were pooled category-wise and subjected to the gut microbiome analysis in the Nanopore sequencer targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Burrows-Wheeler Transform, Ferragina-Manzini index, and Krona charts were used for taxonomical classification and visualization of relative abundances of bacterial species within the metagenome. Alpha- and beta-diversity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Atopic pets at day 0 showed elevation in the gut microbiome population with an adequate concentration of pathogens like Escherichia coli and Clostridiodes difficile with lower amounts of the beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus sp, while the pets at 60 days after dietary intervention showed a significant decline in bacterial species like E coli and C difficile with higher amount of Lactobacillus sp. Both control groups showed variations of microbiome between them as well as from the atopic pets. CONCLUSIONS: We found a close association of poultry meat/egg diet with gut microbiome population and atopic symptoms as well in dogs, and elimination of such diet could be helpful in clinical recovery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dietary intervention with the exclusion of potential allergens from poultry meat and egg sources can be an effective approach for the management of canine atopic dermatitis."

The highest concentration of linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6 trans) was observed in 15% POL treatment. Feeding the POL reduced the malondialdehyde concentration and increased the oxidative stability (p < 0.05). The results showed that POL nutrition had increased the meat quality by increasing oxidative stability, improving properties such as fatty acid composition.

This study assessed the potential of dietary supplementation with linseed oil, Ascophyllum nodosum or treated A. nodosum in an intensive beef cattle feeding system on animal performance, gaseous emissions, ruminal fermentation and microbiota, and muscle fatty acid profiles. Seventy-two dairy-beef bulls (380 kg; 11 mo of age) were randomly allocated to one of four dietary treatments (n = 18) for a 70-d period. The diet consisted of a 60:40 grass silage:concentrate ratio. Silage was offered daily (0900 hours) and concentrates were offered twice daily (0800 and 1500 hours). Dietary treatments were incorporated into the concentrate portion of the diet as follows; 1) CON (no supplementation), 2) LSO (linseed oil), 3) SW (A. nodosum), and 4) EX (A. nodosum extract), included to target 0%, 4%, 2%, and 2% of dry matter intake (DMI), respectively. The concentrates were formulated to be isonitrogenous across the 4 treatment groups. Total DMI (American Calan Inc., Northwood, NH), average daily gain (ADG), gain:feed, and enteric emissions (GreenFeed; C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD) were measured for the 70-d supplementation period. Total DMI (P = 0.17), ADG (P = 0.28), gain:feed (P = 0.68), and total tract digestibility (P = 0.70) did not differ across treatments. Daily methane production (P < 0.001) for CON, LSO, SW, and EX was 210, 170, 202, and 193 g/d, respectively, resulting in reductions of 19% and 8% for LSO and EX, respectively, relative to CON. Ruminal fermentation parameters show that LSO was the only dietary treatment to increase propionate (P = 0.09) and decrease butyrate (P = 0.04) concentrations relative to CON. Microbial analyses showed LSO supplementation increased and decreased relative abundances of fungal genera Buwchfawromyces and Piromyces, respectively, while altering relative abundances of the bacterial genera Muribaculaceae, Bacteroidales RF16 group and Bacterium F082. Additionally, LSO increased linolenic acid (P < 0.001) and n-3 PUFA (P < 0.001) concentration of the longissimus dorsi muscle compared to CON, SW, and EX. In conclusion, LSO was the most effective dietary supplementation strategy compared to CON, EX, and SW, whereby it reduced methane emissions, modified ruminal fermentation and microbial profiles, and enhanced beneficial muscle PUFA concentration, without impacting animal performance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This research aims to reduce white striping muscle defects induced by vascular inflammation and hypoxia using the anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet and anti-atherothrombotic properties of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). To this end, the effects of different doses (0.3, 0.6, 1, 3 and 6 g L-1) of ASA added to drinking water at 24-48 days on growth performance, carcass traits, footpad dermatitis, white striping and breast meat quality parameters were investigated. RESULTS: The results indicate that 0.3, 1, 3 g L-1 and especially 0.6 g L-1 ASA treatment significantly improved growth performance and meat quality parameters. Also, doses of 0.3, 6 g L-1 and especially 0.6 g L-1 of ASA treatment reduced the incidence of white stripe muscle defects. CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, 0.6 g L-1 ASA treatment reduced macrophage infiltrations and myodegeneration caused by growth rate. In addition, this dose increased vascular endothelial growth factor and decreased irisin level in breast muscle. The study also shows that high doses of ASA treatment (3 and 6 g L-1) may make footpad dermatitis more common. This may be due to the fact that ASA can cause side effects such as gizzard ulcers and kidney damage in broiler chickens. © 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Estimates for the cost-effectiveness of food safety interventions are needed to direct food safety management decisions. In this study, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of food safety interventions to control Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. along the chicken meat supply chain in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia. Using Monte-Carlo simulation models, we estimated the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of these interventions from the annual costs of an intervention (in United States Dollar, ($)) divided by their respective public health benefits (avoided disability-adjusted life years (DALY)) for each pathogen separately and for the two pathogens combined. The lower the CER of an intervention the better. In Burkina Faso, out of 16 candidate interventions, the three interventions with the lowest CER were improved handwashing in chicken restaurants (Campylobacter spp. 387 $/avoided DALY (95 % Prediction interval: 69-1468); Salmonella spp. 7801 (1067-33,492)), using designated kitchen utensils at restaurants (549 (107-2026); 4515 (671-18,957)), and avoiding cross contamination between live birds at market (768 (187-2620); 5127 (933-20,423)). In Ethiopia, out of 15, the interventions that came first were improved transport conditions of live birds (296 (79-996); 534 (150-1770)), adding plant extracts to feed or water at farms (387 (69-1532); 581 (108-2256)), and adding organic acids to feed or water at farms (454 (69-1947); 1226 (195-5178)). When all costs were attributed to chicken meat, the household interventions in Ethiopia had substantially higher CER than interventions in other supply chain stages, because of the low number of chickens prepared and consumed at home in a year. When only part of the costs was attributed, the CER of these household interventions were reduced by over 90 % ranking them as the most cost-effective interventions in the supply chain. When considering public health benefits of both Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. in Burkina Faso, the CERs were 11 to 64 % lower compared to the CER when only considering Campylobacter spp. and 59 to 96 % lower if only looking at Salmonella spp., depending on the intervention. In Ethiopia, this was 25 to 80 % for Campylobacter spp. and 36 to 87 % for Salmonella spp., respectively. Thus, attribution of intervention costs to the food product of interest and inclusion of multiple pathogens can have a substantial impact on the estimated cost-effectiveness of control measures. Our developed framework and models can be used to estimate the CER of food safety interventions, guide implementation of food safety measures in chicken meat supply chains of not only in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia but also in other LMICs with similar conditions.",

      "abstract": "During the harvest of Ilex paraguariensis, approximately 2-5 tons per hectare of thick stems are left on the soil surface. The outer portion of these stems, referred to as the coproduct, constitutes 30% of the total residue mass. Although this coproduct has been partially characterized in terms of its phytochemical profile, its technological applications remain unexplored. The objective of this research is to evaluate whether broilers fed with feed incorporating I. paraguariensis harvest prunings will exhibit improved zootechnical performance as well as enhanced biochemical and impacts on meat quality. One-day-old Cobb 500 broilers (n = 300) were raised for 42 days in the broiler shed at the experimental farm in housed in 2.0 m2 pens with a 10 cm layer of poultry litter and equipped with tubular feeders and nipple drinkers. They were arranged in a completely randomized design, comprising four treatments with five replicates of 15 birds each. The treatments consisted of the following diets: a basal diet (0%; the control), feed with 1% coproduct (1% treatment), feed with 2% coproduct (2% treatment), and feed with 3% coproduct (3% treatment). Broilers were assessed for zootechnical performance, intestinal morphometry, and serum biochemical properties. Additionally, meat quality was evaluated, including centesimal composition, chlorogenic acid content, antioxidant activity, metal concentration, and fatty acid profile. Chlorogenic acid was not detected in the meat of broiler chickens. The inclusion of the coproduct impacted both zootechnical performance and meat quality, with a linear effect proportional to the concentration of the additive used in the diet; that is, the worst performance was seen in chickens that consumed 3% of the co-product. It reduced feed consumption and weight gain, lowered cholesterol and triglyceride levels in broiler blood, but increased polyunsaturated fatty acids in the meat, one effect verified for the two largest inclusions (2 and 3% of the co-product). In the intestine, greater villus height and levels of reactive oxygen species were observed in the highest dose of the additive, a group of birds in which greater activity of the enzymes creatine kinase and pyruvate kinase was also observed. In general, none of the doses tested proved to be effective in enhancing productive performance; in addition, it did not increase the concentration of chlorogenic acid in the meat, which would be our hypothesis of having a nutraceutical food.",

Two hundred1-day-old Cobb broilers were randomly divided into four treatment groups and each treatment consisted of 4 replicates of 10 broilers each. The treatment group adopts a 2 × 2 two-factor setting, which is divided into two diets (basic diet or 250 mg/kg ALA diet) and two temperatures (24 ± 1℃ or 33 ± 1℃). Starting from the 28th day of age, broilers are kept at room temperature (24 ± 1℃) or exposed to cyclic HS (33 ± 1℃ from 8:00 am to 18:00, 24 ± 1℃ from 18:00 to 8:00 am). HS significantly decreased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), direct bilirubin (D-BIL), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD). However, HS increased breast meat pH, serum uric acid (UA), total cholesterol (TC) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Dietary ALA significantly decreased leg meat shear force and water loss rate, serum total bilirubin(T-BIL), UA, triglyceride (TG) and MDA of broilers. However, it increased daily gain (ADG), serum D-BIL and T-SOD. There is a significant interaction between temperature and additives. HS can destroy the balance of the oxidation-antioxidant system, and lead to damage to liver and kidney function and confusion energy metabolism. Dietary ALA improves the antioxidant capacity of broilers, reduces the level of blood lipids and liver and kidney metabolism, and increases the daily gain of heat-stressed broilers.",

      "abstract": "Ivermectin (IVM) is one of the most widely used antiparasitic drugs worldwide and has become the drug of choice for anthelmintic and tick treatment in beef cattle production. Drugs used in production animals requires a withdrawal period after treatment to avoid residual concentrations above the defined maximun residue level (MRL). The aims of this study were to quantify the residue level of IVM in different muscles of cattle at several different time periods following 1% or 3.15% IVM administration and also determined whether the residue concentration was affected by industrial thermal processing. Distinct pattern of IVM residue distribution was observed in each tissue evaluated. After completed the IVM withdrawal periods, nearly all tissues presented IVM residues concentration below the established Codex Alimentarius MRLs, except for the injection site, which means that the calculation to determine the withdrawal period for the injection site should not be the same as that used for standard edible tissues. Also, the thermal processing to which canned products are exposed causes changes in the levels of quantified residues in comparison to raw products, which must be taken into consideration in surveillance program assessments and generates concerns regarding the possibility of residue limit violation in importing markets."

      "abstract": "Worldwide, there are reports indicating that sheep raised in insular systems spontaneously consume seaweed. In the southern hemisphere, there exists Durvillaea antarctica, a brown seaweed that possesses minerals and fatty acids that could improve some aspects of sheep production and meat quality, respectively. However, the consumption of this algae in lambs has been scarcely studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary inclusion of Durvillaea antarctica meal on the growth performance, blood profile, and meat quality of fattening lambs. Thirty Araucana Creole lambs were housed and allocated to three pens. One pen served as a control, while the remaining two were supplemented with diets containing 5% and 10% Durvillaea antarctica meal. After 9 weeks, the animals were slaughtered. The dietary treatments did not significantly affect body weight and blood biochemical parameters. However, changes were observed in meat quality traits, including increased redness and reduced luminosity in the loin for the high inclusion treatment, in addition to slight alterations in pH and lower lipid oxidation in lambs' meat fed Durvillaea antarctica. Furthermore, the meat from lambs supplemented with Durvillaea antarctica exhibited increased levels of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, along with higher monounsaturated fatty acid content and a reduced omega-3/omega-6 ratio. This study shows that Durvillaea antarctica can be used to feed lambs without impairing growth or production parameters, which has been little studied. It is possible that this brown seaweed could be considered a natural additive to improve the quality and nutritional value of lamb meat. The effect of this seaweed on other ruminant models could be addressed in future studies."

      "abstract": "This research investigated the effects of cassava residue meal (CRM) and fermented CRM (FCRM) on the growth performance, serum lipid indicators, carcass traits, and meat quality of Huanjiang mini-pigs. One hundred twenty Huanjiang mini-pigs with similar BW (body weight, 8.85 ± 0.64 kg) were divided into three dietary treatment groups: the CON group with a basal diet; the CRM group with a diet containing 5% CRM; and the FCRM group with a diet containing 5% FCRM. The feeding trial was conducted for 30 days. The findings revealed that dietary CRM and FCRM did not influence the growth performance and diarrhea rate of Huanjiang mini-pigs (p > 0.05). Dietary FCRM supplementation increased serum total cholesterol level compared to the CON group while decreasing serum cholinesterase level compared to the CON and CRM groups (p < 0.05). The level of serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was higher (p < 0.05) in the CRM and FCRM groups in regard to the CON group. In addition, CRM and FCRM supplementation reduced (p < 0.05) the backfat thickness and carcass yield of Huanjiang mini-pigs. The meat quality analysis showed that dietary CRM and FCRM improved the meat quality by increasing the intramuscular fat content and redness (a*) value and decreasing the lightness (L*) value. Moreover, the MyHC-IIx expression in the longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle was upregulated (p < 0.05) in the CRM group, while MYHC-IIb expression displayed an increasing trend (p = 0.076) in the FCRM group relative to the CON group. The fatty acid composition in the LT muscle also revealed that the C20:0 level was lower in the CRM and FCRM groups, while the ∑SFA and ∑SFA/∑UFA were reduced (p < 0.05) in the FCRM group relative to the CON group. In summary, dietary CRM and FCRM supplementation improved the meat quality of Huanjiang mini-pigs without affecting growth performance and diarrhea rate. Notably, FCRM exhibited better effects on meat quality than CRM."

      "abstract": "The safety and health of food have been persistent concerns, particularly about meat products. Low-temperature meat products refer to those that are processed at lower temperatures. Meat, rich in proteins and other nutrients, is highly susceptible to microbial contamination, leading to spoilage, particularly when processed at lower temperatures that increase storage and transportation requirements. In response to the limitations of conventional preservation methods, such as heat treatment and chemical bacteriostats, emerging preservation technologies are increasingly being adopted. These technologies aim to mitigate the negative effects of microorganisms on meat products. Non-thermal technologies and biotechnological approaches, which are low in energy consumption and energy efficiency, are becoming more prevalent. Non-thermal sterilization technology is widely applied in various food products. It maintains the original quality of food, enhances food safety, reduces energy consumption, and improves production efficiency. Biocides are extensively used in the antibacterial field owing to their high efficiency, low toxicity, and long-lasting properties. Both non-thermal sterilization technology and biocides can ensure food safety, extend the shelf life of food products, improve food quality, meet consumers' demand for natural and healthy food, enhance market competitiveness, and play a positive role in promoting the sustainable development of the food industry. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the specific applications of biocides and non-thermal sterilization methods in food, highlighting the control parameters and their effects on microbes during low-temperature meat processing, to supply pertinent researchers with theoretical references."

The inclusion of tamarind components led to a reduction in the moisture and protein content of the reformulated frankfurters. In terms of mineral composition, CT5 showed the highest (p < 0.05) calcium content. Additionally, ST5 and CT5 treatments demonstrated the lowest processing loss values. The pH was lower in the PT5 treatment (p < 0.05). Incorporating tamarind components reduced the lightness (L*) of the frankfurters, resulting in darker sausages. However, ST5 exhibited greater redness (a*), while higher yellowness (b*) values were observed in PT5 and CT5 treatments (p < 0.05). Texture analysis revealed no differences (p > 0.05) in hardness and chewiness between T0 and PT5; however, ST5 exhibited the highest values for these parameters (p < 0.05). No variation in the conformational order of the lipid acyl chains due to the incorporation of tamarind compounds was observed related to physical entrapment of these compounds in the frankfurter matrix. Both T0 and PT5 were well accepted by consumers, and scores higher than 7 were observed for overall acceptability and purchase intention. The study demonstrated that incorporating tamarind components, especially pulp paste (PT), is a viable alternative for replacing lean pork meat in frankfurters, improving the sustainable aspects of frankfurter production."

      "abstract": "The quality grade of cow meat is often lower than that of steer meat, resulting in economic losses and reduced consumer satisfaction. This review explores various strategies for improving the quality of cow meat, with a focus on slaughter and post-slaughter practices. Certain slaughter methods, including electrical stimulation and suspension techniques, have been shown to improve meat tenderness by alleviating rigor mortis and inducing an increase in sarcomere length. Electrical stimulation triggers an increase in calcium release, which activates proteolytic enzymes, including calpain, resulting in the breakdown of muscle fibers. In contrast, suspension methods, including pelvic suspension, utilize gravity to maintain muscle elasticity. Post-slaughter treatments, which include wet and dry aging, have varying effects on the tenderness and flavor of meat. Wet aging helps retain moisture and activate the meat-tenderizing enzymes, whereas dry aging enhances flavor through moisture evaporation and microbial activity. Several patented technologies, which include electrical stimulation combined with suspension methods, heat treatments, and microbial pre-treatment, have been developed to further improve the tenderness and flavor of meat during slaughter and aging. The application of these techniques promise significant enhancement in the quality and consumer appeal of cow meat."

      "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes raises major challenges for the food industry. Due to its capacity to form biofilms, this pathogen can persist in processing environments and contaminate the final products. Neutral electrolyzed water (NEW) may offer a promising and eco-friendly method for controlling L. monocytogenes biofilms, though current in vitro studies on its antibiofilm activity are limited and often focused on reference strains. In this study, we assessed the effect of NEW on biofilms formed by meat-related and reference L. monocytogenes strains on polystyrene and stainless steel. Forty wild-type strains isolated from meat products and processing environments were firstly screened for their biofilm-forming abilities and classified as weak (30 %; 12/40), moderate (55 %; 22/40), and strong (15 %; 6/40) biofilm producers. Twenty-two wild-type and two reference strains were selected for the eradication assays, performed by treating the biofilms with NEW for 9 minutes of total contact time. In silico functional enrichment analysis and the visualization of biofilms by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were also performed. The NEW treatment resulted in a greater average reduction of viable cells in biofilms formed on polystyrene (4.3 ± 1.0 log10 CFU/cm2) compared to stainless steel (2.9 ± 2.0 log10 CFU/cm2), and a remarkable intraspecies variability was observed. SEM images revealed higher structural damage on biofilms formed on polystyrene. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated elements could be involved in resistance to the treatments. NEW could be a promising additional tool to mitigate L. monocytogenes biofilms in meat processing environments, although its effect varied with surface material and strain-specific characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Iron deficiency is a widespread nutritional problem affecting millions of people globally, leading to various health issues including anemia. Iron fortification of meat and meat products has emerged as an effective strategy to combat this issue. This review explores the process and benefits of iron fortification, focusing on the types of iron compounds suitable for fortification, such as ferrous sulfate and ferric pyrophosphate, their bioavailability, and their impact on the sensory and nutritional qualities of meat products. Technological challenges and solutions, including encapsulation, chelation, and microencapsulation techniques, have been examined to minimize their negative impacts on sensory qualities. This review also discusses the regulatory framework governing iron fortification and consumer acceptance. Analytical methods for determining iron content, such as spectrophotometric and colorimetric detection, are discussed. Although iron-fortified meat products offer health benefits, sensory aspects and consumer acceptance are important considerations. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the role and significance of iron fortification in meat products as a public health intervention to address iron deficiency.",

This study evaluated the effects of shade-dried ground garlic leaf (GL) powder and papaya leaf (PL) powder as crop waste on feed intake, growth performance, ruminal microbial counts, gut epithelial barrier functions, and meat quality in goats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty male adult Beetal goats were randomly divided into five treatment groups: (1) Control (basal diet only); (2) basal diet supplemented with 6% bromodichloromethane (BCM); (3) basal diet supplemented with 30% GL powder; (4) basal diet supplemented with 26% PL powder; and (5) basal diet supplemented with 30% GL powder and 26% PL powder (GP). RESULTS: Average weight gain, feed conversion ratio, fecal score, and albumin improved in the GP. Aspartate transferase increased significantly in BCM, GL, and PL and was insignificant in the GP group compared with the C group. There was a 13% decrease in methanogen count in PL compared with C, but this difference was not significant between BCM and GP. Ruminal bacteria and protozoa were lowest in GL. Ruminal papilla height and surface area increased in the supplemented groups compared with C (p < 0.05). In vitro experiments using isolated ruminal epithelia revealed a 39% increase in short-circuit current in GP compared with C (p < 0.05). For meat parameters, the pH 24 h decreased significantly in GL compared to BCM. CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementations with GL and PL alone or in combination improved growth parameters and gut performance and reduced rumen methanogen levels without altering meat quality parameters. Proper diet formulation and further research on other ruminants may help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock."

      "abstract": "Exploitation of compensatory growth (CG) is a widely practised management strategy in beef production, especially under pastoral conditions due to its potential to reduce feed costs. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of nutritional restriction during backgrounding in Angus steers slaughtered at either similar age and/or similar BW on feed efficiency, body composition, carcass characteristics and meat quality attributes under either a forage or feedlot-based finishing diet. Eighty steers (BW: 444 ± 39 kg, age: 18 ± 1 months) were blocked and randomly assigned within block to either an optimal (0.6-0.7 kg/day) or suboptimal (0.3-0.4 kg/day) growth rate, during 97 days of backgrounding. Following, half of the steers in each group were finished on a forage diet while the other half were finished on feedlot-based diet. Half of the steers in each treatment were then slaughtered at similar age (24 months), whilst all remaining steers were slaughtered at similar BW (∼620 kg). Two extra slaughters were done with other representative steers on day 0 and day 97, to provide baseline parameters for carcass and non-carcass measurements. During the backgrounding period, optimal steers gained more than suboptimal (P < 0.01), resulting in higher BW and hot carcass weight (HCW; P < 0.01). During the finishing period, the suboptimal group increased BW gain (P < 0.01) and displayed an improved feed conversion ratio (FCR; P < 0.01). Differences (P < 0.01) in BW and HCW remained between the treatments when slaughtered at a similar age. When the steers were slaughtered at similar BW, after additional days of finishing for the suboptimal groups, no differences (P > 0.05) in backgrounding treatment on HCW, carcass grading, body composition or FCR for the entire period (backgrounding and finishing) were apparent. Indeed, no differences (P > 0.05) by backgrounding growth strategy were observed for any meat quality variables assessed using instrumental or sensory evaluations. During the finishing period, feedlot steers had increased (P < 0.01) BW and HCW gains, improved (P < 0.05) FCR and carcass grading, and had higher (P < 0.05) HCW compared to forage finished steers. However, no differences (P > 0.05) were observed for any meat quality variables assessed by finishing system. Overall, exploiting CG within pasture-based beef cattle production systems improves growth rate and FCR in both forage and feedlot finishing. Suboptimal backgrounded steers required additional days on feed to achieve similar BW to their contemporaries. Nevertheless, at similar BW, there were no residual differences in body composition, FCR during the entire period, meat tenderness or overall meat liking because of the backgrounding conditions.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of acrylamide in commercially available plant-based meat alternatives before and after heat treatment. Trace levels of acrylamide were detected in all samples before heat-treatment, while the concentrations increased in 11 samples out of 16 after heat-treatment. The highest concentration of acrylamide increased from 65.7 ± 6.6 µg kg-1 before to 119 ± 12 µg kg-1 after heat-treatment. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that besides macronutrient composition, the use of additives and processing techniques have a strong influence on acrylamide formation in plant-based meat alternatives.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary methionine (Met) supplementation on performance, immunity, and meat quality in growing Japanese quail exposed to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-contaminated diets. Nine experimental diets were formulated, incorporating three levels of dietary Met (5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 g/kg) and three levels of AFB1 (0.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg) in a completely randomized design and fed from d 8 post-hatch to d 35 of age. The results revealed that increasing dietary Met levels significantly improved body weight gain (BWG; P < 0.001), feed conversion ratio (FCR; P < 0.001), and feed intake (FI; P < 0.001), while counteracting the negative effects of AFB1 on these performance parameters. Dietary Met supplementation also exerted a protective effect against elevated hepatic enzyme levels (AST, P < 0.001; ALT, P < 0.001; ALP, P = 0.001; and LDH, P < 0.001) and serum uric acid levels (P < 0.001) induced by AFB1. Furthermore, dietary Met enhanced humoral immunity responses by increasing antibody production against sheep red blood cell antigen (P < 0.001) and hemagglutination inhibition response (P < 0.001), mitigating the AFB1-induced immune impairment. Meat quality parameters, including pH (P = 0.04), drip loss (P < 0.001), and malondialdehyde concentration (P < 0.001), were significantly influenced by the interaction between dietary Met and AFB1. Lastly, dietary Met supplementation effectively counteracted AFB1's detrimental effects on ileal lactic acid bacteria populations (P < 0.001). In conclusion, dietary Met supplementation shows promise as a nutritional intervention to alleviate the harmful effects of AFB1 exposure in Japanese quail, particularly in improving food quality and overall health."

      "abstract": "In the pursuit of more sustainable diets, researchers have been studying ways to promote a transition from animal-based to plant-based meals in foodservice contexts by influencing participants' conscious choices through names, labels, claims, and information. This critical review found that these interventions usually mobilize only those already engaged in reducing the consumption of animal products and often only during the intervention period, failing to influence those who eat most meat or to create long-lasting effects. Analyzing the choice for vegetarian meals against meals with meat in recently published studies conducted in foodservice contexts, we argue that the transition to more sustainable diets should rely less on consumers' willpower and more on public policies and institutional measures that change the availability, price, and visibility of plant-based meals. Inspired by behavioral sciences, this paper discusses interventions that challenge meals with meat as the default option and suggests hybrids as a path to increase the availability, convenience, and sensory familiarity of vegetarian meals. The paper ends with proposals for questions, interventions, metrics, and issues to be researched by consumer science, including questions on the degree of freedom of consumers' choice and what would be the ethical limits to telling half the truth about hybrids.",

The treatment groups are: control: basal diet; DsAp0.5: basal diet + 0.25 g Ds+ 0.25 g Ap/kg diet; DsAp1: basal diet + 0.50 g Ds+ 0.50 g Ap/kg diet; and DsAp2: basal diet + 1.00 g Ds+ 1.00 g Ap/kg diet. The outcomes of dietary inclusion of Ds plus Ap revealed a significant difference in live body weight at 5 week and body weight gain from (1-5wk) (P=0.049) and the group DsAp1 recorded the best results (191.19g, 5.69g). The mixture of Ds plus Ap did not significantly (P>0.05) change the feed intake during the experiment. The DsAp0.5 group significantly (P=0.019) presented the best feed conversion ratio during (1-5 wk of age) compared to the control and other groups. The finding showed a non-significant difference in carcass traits (P>0.05). Liver and kidney function markers were affected by the supplements, and DsAp2 group recorded the highest levels of total protein and albumin. The DsAp1 group significantly (P=0.003) presented the lowest level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the DsAp2 group significantly (P<0.001) presented the lowest levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and urea. Dietary supplementation of Ds plus Ap affected the lipid profiles of the quail. Dietary supplementation of Ds plus Ap mixture reduced the concentration of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) when compared to control (P<0.001). Furthermore, the immune parameters, complement 3 (C3) and lysozyme showed a non-significant variation with Ds plus Ap supplementation. The net revenue and economic efficiency of treated quails was significantly increased during the experiment (1-5 wks of age); the best values were observed in DsAp0.5 group. In conclusion, the use of Ds plus Ap mixture as growth promoters in quail diets improves the growth performance, liver functions and lipid profile.",

Evaluations were conducted at storage intervals of 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 days. The methodology assessed antioxidant activity through 2,2-diphenyl 1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, which showed a linear increase with pine nut extract concentration, reaching 59.24% at 2%. Chemical indicators, such as peroxide values, thiobarbituric acid values, free fatty acids, and total volatile basic nitrogen, decreased significantly (p ≤ 0.05) with higher concentrations of pine nut extract, with the lowest values recorded at 2% across all storage days. Microbial analysis showed a significant reduction (p ≤ 0.05) in the total viable count, psychrotrophic bacteria count, lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and H₂S-producing bacteria with increasing pine nut concentrations, with the 2% treatment yielding the lowest microbial loads throughout storage. Sensory evaluation indicated that higher pine nut concentrations improved the acceptability of color, odor, and taste (p ≤ 0.05). However, significant degradation (p ≤ 0.05) in chemical, microbial, and sensory parameters occurred with prolonged storage duration. In conclusion, the 2% pine nut extract was the most effective immersion treatment for extending the shelf life of rainbow trout fillets for up to 12 days."

The production of cultured meat requires efficient, animal component-free in vitro systems for muscle stem cell (MuSC) expansion. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) is a critical growth factor that regulates the MuSC function. In this study, we established an efficient method for the soluble expression and purification of recombinant porcine FGF1 (rpFGF1) in Escherichia coli, achieving a yield of 48 mg of purified protein per liter of culture. Treatment with rpFGF1 significantly enhanced the proliferation of porcine MuSC under serum-free conditions. Furthermore, rpFGF1 induced mitochondrial fission and mitophagy by activating the ERK-dependent phosphorylation of DRP1 at Ser616, resulting in improved mitochondrial function and proliferation capacity in porcine MuSC. These findings highlight the potential of rpFGF1 in the development of serum-free media for scalable and sustainable cultured meat production.",

Birds in the control (CON) group and LPS-challenged treatment (LPS) group were fed a basal diet, and birds in the other three treatment groups received the basal diet with 150, 300, or 450 mg/kg added GA (GA150, GA300, GA450). On days 14, 17, and 20, chickens in the LPS, GA150, GA300, and GA450 groups received intramuscular injections of LPS, while chickens in the CON group received saline. The results showed that the addition of GA to the diet could effectively increase the average daily gain (ADG) of broilers from 1 to 50 days of age, and had a trend (p = 0.078) of increasing the average daily feed intake (ADFI). Adding 450 mg/kg GA to the diet significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the drip loss and pH value of pectoral muscles 45 min after slaughter, and significantly increased (p < 0.05) the lightness value of pectoral muscles 45 min post-slaughter. With an increase in GA level, the content of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) in pectoral muscles decreased linearly (p < 0.05), and the concentration of C22:6n-3 increased linearly (p < 0.05). GA effectively improved (p < 0.05) the antioxidant capacity of muscles and significantly increased (p < 0.05) the activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) in pectoral muscles after LPS stimulation, exhibiting linear and quadratic changes (p < 0.05). It also significantly increased (p < 0.05) the activity of hydrogen peroxide and decreased the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), while it linearly decreased (p < 0.05) the content of malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition, the dietary supplementation of GA significantly increased (p < 0.05) the expression levels of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) I and MyHC IIa in pectoral muscles and significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the expression level of MyHC IIx. In summary, the dietary addition of GA can alleviate the effect of the stress response on the growth performance of broiler chickens and improve antioxidant capacity and meat quality. The appropriate amount of dietary GA at each stage was 300 mg/kg."

The objective of this work is to study productive performances of heavy Duroc X (Landrace X Large white) male and female pigs during the finishing stage under a 2% CP reduction with crystalline AA supplementation. A total of 60 entire male and 60 female pigs (means ± standard deviations: 109 ± 4.9 days of age; 67.9 ± 7.18 kg of body weight) were distributed in split-sex pens (6 pigs/pen) and fed ad libitum. Two isoenergetic diets were provided (145 and 125 g CP/kg with AA supplementation, control and low-CP) during the final 42 days of finishing period. Growth performance, carcass and meat traits were evaluated. The fixed effects of dietary treatment, sex and their interaction were considered and simple least squares models used. Males were 7.25% heavier (p < 0.001) and had 16% higher average daily gains (p < 0.0001) than females in both treatments with no differences in feed intake or feed conversion ratio (p > 0.05). Nitrogen efficiency was 35% higher in low-CP males. Little difference was found for most carcass and meat traits between treatments. Males had 7-8% higher loin subcutaneous fat thickness in both dietary treatments (p = 0.011). Males and females of the low-CP diet showed higher fat and saturated fat contents than controls (p = 0.020). A 20 g/kg CP reduction with AA supplementation is an efficient strategy during the finishing phase without productivity losses in heavy Duroc sire line genotypes of both sexes."

      "abstract": "Salmonella Abortusequi (S. Abortusequi) is the primary cause of abortions in equine animals, and can cause serious foodborne illness. Thus, effective biocontrol strategies are needed to decontaminate and control the emergence of foodborne diseases. In recent years, phages have been used as a new strategy for modulating foodborne pathogens and food safety. In this study, a new phage, vB_SalP_LDDK01, was isolated from donkey farm bedding. The data indicated that the incubation period of vB_SalP_LDDK01 was 10 min, the burst size was 378 PFU/cell, as well as a wide range of heat resistance (40-70°C) and pH stability (4-12). Furthermore, genomic analysis and electron microscopy indicated that vB_SalP_LDDK01 belongs to the Class Caudoviricetes and genus Jerseyvirus. Moreover, its genome was 42,378 bp long, encoded 57 ORFs, was double-stranded DNA with a 49.52% GC content, and lacked virulence and drug-resistant genes. In addition, how vB_SalP_LDDK01 inhibits the growth of S. Abortusequi and removes the biofilm of S. Abortusequi was assessed in a liquid broth medium, and the results showed that vB_SalP_LDDK01 inhibited the growth of S. Abortusequi for about 8 h and significantly reduced the viable bacteria abundance compared with the phage-free positive control. Further, vB_SalP_LDDK01 treated the host bacteria for 12 h and effectively destroyed the biofilm of S. Abortusequi. This study further investigated how effectively vB_SalP_LDDK01 modulates bacterial contamination in donkey meat inoculated with S. Abortusequi LCU-S-ABORT-F at 4°C and 25°C. Furthermore, after 72 h of vB_SalP_LDDK01 treatment with different multiplicity of infection (1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001), the bacterial contamination on the surface of donkey meat was reduced by 4.3, 3.7, 3.3, and 3.5 log10 CFU/piece at 25°C, and 4.5, 3.9, 2.8, and 2.7 log10 CFU/piece at 4°C. Whereas the phage titers at different temperatures were basically comparable to the initial titers. Overall, these results indicated that vB_SalP_LDDK01, the new phage, can serve as an effective biological agent and inhibit S. Abortusequi in donkey meat.",

A total of 450, 21-wk-old finishing pigs with an average body weight of 113.7 ± 8 kg were housed in 90 pens assigned to one of five dietary treatments in a 2 × 2 + 1 factorial design. Dietary treatments consisted of two fat sources (CWG: 4% inclusion of choice white grease and HOSO: 4% inclusion of high oleic soybean oil) each provided 2 or 4 wk before marketing. The \"+1\" diet was corn-based without fat inclusion (CON). Observations included growth performance, carcass characteristics, fatty acid (FA) profile, and sensory evaluation. Data was analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS considering dietary treatment as a main effect, feeding duration, and their interactions. Preplanned contrasts were used to compare dietary treatments with the control. From day 14 to 28 and the overall experimental period (day 0-28), pigs fed fat-supplemented diets had a greater (P < 0.05) average daily gain and gain-to-feed ratio than CON-fed pigs. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in growth performance when comparing fat sources or feeding periods. Pigs supplemented with either CWG or HOSO showed a tendency to have a greater (P < 0.10) belly weight and belly yield, and a lesser (P < 0.10) loin yield and loin muscle area when compared with CON pigs. The loin from pigs fed fat sources had greater (P < 0.05) oleic acid and eicosenoic acid concentration when compared with CON. When CWG was compared with HOSO, pigs fed CWG had a higher (P < 0.05) concentration of palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the HOSO pigs had a higher concentration of oleic acid and linolenic acid in the loin. In the belly, CON had a higher (P < 0.05) concentration of palmitic acid and stearic acid compared to HOSO, while pigs fed fat sources had a higher concentration of oleic acid and eicosenoic acid. Bellies from HOSO had higher (P < 0.05) oleic acid and α-linolenic acid methyl ester concentrations, while CWG had higher concentrations of g-linolenic acid. For the sensory evaluation, the palatability and acceptability of pork were not affected (P > 0.05) by dietary treatments. In conclusion, supplementation with HOSO not only improved performance but tended to improve some carcass characteristics and increased the concentration of oleic acid, and some other unsaturated FA with a concomitant decrease in the concentration of some saturated FA in pork.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gynura procumbens (Lour.) Merr is a common traditional Chinese medicine with anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, no related studies reported the potential application effect of Gynura procumbens on meat ducks. The study aims to investigate the potential effects of Gynura procumbens extract (GPE) supplementation on growth performance, carcass traits, antioxidant capacity, immunity and meat quality. METHODS: A total of 480 21-day-old female healthy ducks were randomly allocated to four treatments, each treatment containing six replicates with 20 ducks per replicate. The groups received a corn-soybean basal diet supplemented with 0 mg/kg GPE (CON), 200 mg/kg GPE (GPE200), 400 mg/kg GPE (GPE400), and 600 mg/kg GPE (GPE600), respectively. The entire experiment lasted for 7 weeks. RESULTS: The results showed that dietary supplementation with 600 mg/kg GPE significantly reduced the contents of serum urea nitrogen, triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC). GPE (200, 400, and 600 mg/kg) supplementation effectively reduced the contents of IL-2 and MDA. The levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) as well as total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) in GPE600 group dramatically elevated in comparison with the control group. Dietary GPE supplementation considerably increased the moisture content of the breast muscle. Furthermore, dietary supplementation with GPE markedly decreased the water loss rate and shear force. DISCUSSION: With the ban of antibiotics in poultry production, traditional Chinese medicines have been widely used in livestock and poultry production due to their high efficiency and low toxicity. Gynura procumbens extract GPE as a natural plant origin contains a series of biologically active components, including flavonoids, polyphenols, saponin, tannin and terpenoid. This study indicated that dietary supplementation with GPE can increase serum total antioxidant capacity, regulate immune function and improve meat quality to some extent in meat ducks. The recommended optimal GPE level in the diet of meat ducks is 600 mg/kg according to the results in this study."

The data were analyzed using a completely randomized experimental design, with each lamb considered an experimental unit (nine replicates/treatment). Dietary supplementation with CaPr or NaPr did not affect (p > 0.05) growth performance or dietary energetics. However, greater (p = 0.05) apparent dry matter digestibility was observed in the lambs that consumed the diet with NaPr10. Dietary supplementation with CaPr or NaPr did not affect (p > 0.05) ruminal pH or ruminal concentrations of ammonia nitrogen, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total volatile fatty acids. However, ruminal lactate concentration increased (p = 0.01) in lambs consuming the NaPr diet. Hot carcass weight and yield, backfat thickness, meat pH, meat color (L*, a*, and b*), cooking loss, and water holding capacity were not affected by dietary supplementation with CaPr or NaPr. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 10 g/kg DM of calcium propionate or sodium propionate does not affect growth performance, dietary energetics, ruminal fermentation, and the meat quality of finishing lambs."

      "abstract": "Yak (Bos grunniens) is a large ruminant endemic to the Tibetan plateau. The addition of enzyme complexes to feed can significantly improve their growth performance. Therefore, studying the effects of ruminant compound enzyme preparations dosage on yak rumen microorganisms and production performance is crucial to promoting the development of the yak industry. This study aimed to determine the effects of feeding yaks with different doses of ruminant enzyme compounds on the performance, meat quality, and rumen microorganisms of yaks. Three kinds of experimental diets with doses of 0.5 g/kg (LE group), 1 g/kg (ME group), and 2 g/kg (HE group) were selected to determine the growth index, meat quality, serum biochemical indexes, rumen fluid pH and other indexes of the three experimental groups. Metagenomics studies were used to investigate the differences in rumen microbial composition and function among yak groups, and transcriptome sequencing of the longest dorsal muscle was performed to reveal the expression of differential genes among different groups. It was determined that the levels of dietary enzyme complexes significantly affected growth performance, rumen fluid pH, and serum biochemical indices. At the phylum level, the dominant phylum in all three treatment groups was Bacteroidota, Bacillota, Kiritimatiellota, and Pseudomonadota. At the genus level, Prevotella, Methanobrevibacter, Oscillibacter. Fibrobacter showed statistically significant differences in abundance (p < 0.05). CAZymes family analysis revealed significant differences in GHs, CTs, and CEs among the three groups. Genome-wide differential gene expression in the longest muscle of the yak back was analyzed by RNA-seq between the three experimental groups. Some DEGs were found to be enriched in the ECM, PI3K-Akt, PPAR, and protein digestion and absorption receptor pathways. Combined metagenomics and transcriptomics analyses revealed that some microorganisms were significantly associated with the genes COL11A1, POSTN, and PTHLH, which are involved in growth metabolism. In summary, this study investigated the effects and interrelationships of ruminant complex enzymes on yak performance, meat quality, and rumen environment. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for adding ruminant enzymes to yaks."

This study was designed to determine the prevalence of S. aureus strains in raw milk and meat in Italy and to evaluate their antibiotic resistance profiles and biofilm production. Among the meat isolates, 41.67% were resistant to ampicillin, and 25% were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In milk, 20% of the isolates were resistant to gentamycin, while 5.71% were MRSA. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains was higher in meat (16.67%) compared to milk (5.71%). The biofilm formation capability was assessed in most of the isolates (80% in milk and 100% in meat). Representative strains exhibiting different antibiotic resistance profiles were all negative for the enterotoxin genes sea, seb, sec, sed, and see, but harbored potential virulence factors such as hemolytic activity, high pigmentation, low cell envelop permeability, charged and hydrophobicity. Finally, the interaction of representative strains with human Caco-2 intestinal cell line showed that most strains had an adhesion capacity. Our findings reveal that foodborne isolates of S. aureus present a considerable threat to consumers due to their production of virulence factors, which enhance their pathogenicity and increase the likelihood of antibiotic treatment failures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A healthy diet has been proposed to support good mental health, but the addition of either red meat or meat alternatives is nuanced. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine if psychological and physiological well-being is differentially affected by consuming recommended weekly amounts of either lean red meat or plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs) supplemented with a plant-rich diet. METHODS: The trial was a parallel 2-arm randomized intervention of 10 wk duration. Eighty healthy omnivorous young adults were clustered as 40 cohabitating household pairs. Each pair was randomly assigned to consume 3 weekly servings of either fresh New Zealand beef and lamb or the equivalent PBMA. They maintained an otherwise ovo-lacto vegetarian diet, aided by a weekly meal kit and supported by engaged advice from research dietitians. Psychological measures were well-being (World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index); depression, anxiety, and stress (depression anxiety stress scales-short form-21); and fatigue (multidimensional fatigue symptom inventory-short form) assessed weekly throughout the trial. Blood biomarkers included neurotransmitter-related compounds, iron status and vitamins B12 and D. Physical activity and sleep were estimated by a fitness wristband. Mixed effect modeling evaluated changes in each outcome over time relative to its baseline and compared the 2 interventions accounting for randomization unit clustering. RESULTS: Thirty-nine household pairs completed the trial. Participants measured as psychologically healthy at baseline. There were no significant differences between groups in the degree of change from baseline for the psychological outcomes, nor for the majority of the circulatory markers. Differences in changes to vitamin B12 status and 3 neurotransmitter-related compounds (adenosine, agmatine, and tyrosine) from baseline to week 10 were observed between groups. Results were similar in all sensitivity analyses when adjusting for physical activity, sleep, and diet quality covariates. CONCLUSIONS: There was no effect on the psychological measures and limited change to physiological status when comparing a balanced diet containing either red meat or PBMAs in healthy young adults."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effectiveness of cysteine in improving the functional properties of pea proteins within low-salt myofibrillar protein (MP) gels. Cysteine treatment, at a concentration of 3.3 mM/g protein, cleaved 71-82 % of the disulfide bonds in native and pH-shifted pea protein isolates (PPIN and PPIpH), which increased the solubility and hydrophobicity of PPIpH. PPIN showed slight changes, primarily an increase in tryptophan fluorescence. The cleavage of disulfide bonds improved the hardness, elastic component (G'), and network integrity of hybrid gels. When combined with transglutaminase, the MP + PPIpH gel reached its maximum hardness (0.38 N) at a cysteine concentration of 1.7 mM/g protein. SDS-PAGE patterns and gels treated with additional N-ethylmaleimid confirmed the involvement of cysteine-treated PPI in the gel matrix. Consequently, cysteine-mediated disulfide bond disruption effectively modifies pea proteins, rendering them a more suitable functional ingredient for enhancing the texture of low-salt meat products.",

      "abstract": "Glutathione (GSH) is an important precursor of meat flavor. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of GSH-curing on the flavor of cooked chicken. GSH-cured chicken with different concentrations and uncured chicken (blank) were roasted separately and comprehensively analyzed in terms of flavors, odor-active compounds, free amino acids, and fatty acids profile. Volatile flavor compounds were analyzed using solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) along with GC-MS, GC-O/AEDA, and odor activity value (OAV) calculations. The results showed that the contents of most flavors derived from the Maillard reaction increased due to GSH-curing treatment, such as 2-methylthiophene, 3-methylthiophene, 2-methylthiazole, and 5-methylthiazole, while the lipid degradation flavors reduced, like hexanal, heptanal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal. In particular, during sensory analysis, the cured sample with 1.6 mmol GSH had the greatest roasted meaty odor. In addition, GSH curing results in the increased formation of key odor-active substances (OAV ≥ 1), such as 2-acetylthiazole.",
