      "abstract": "Orthosiphon stamineus (OS) or Orthosiphon aristatus var. aristatus (OAA) is commonly known as cat's whiskers or \"misai kucing\". It is an herbaceous shrub that is popular in many different traditional and complementary medicinal systems. Its popularity has been justified by the plethora of studies that have shown that the secondary metabolites of the plant has effects that range from anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective to anorexic and antihypertensive. As such, OS could also be a potential treatment for Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders. However, a cohesive synthesis of the protective actions of OS was lacking. This systematic review was therefore commenced to elaborate on the various protective mechanisms of OS in the CNS. The PRISMA model was used and five databases (Google Scholar, SCOPUS, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and PubMed) were searched with relevant keywords to finally identify four articles that met the inclusion criteria. The articles described the protective effects of OS extracts on Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, learning and memory, oxidative stress, and neurotoxicity. All the articles found were experimental or preclinical studies on animal models or in vitro systems. The reported activities demonstrated that OS could be a potential neuroprotective agent and might improve CNS conditions like neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Orthosiphon stamineus is used traditionally to treat gout, arthritis, and inflammatory related conditions. The in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of the plant have been scientifically investigated. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the potential of the 50% ethanol extract of O. stamineus (EOS) to treat rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: Anti-arthritic activity was assessed using the in vitro heat denaturation test and the (FCA)-induced arthritis model. Efficacy was assessed by measurements of paw edema and granulation, X-ray radiography, fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), and histological evaluation. Levels of (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and (COX-1 and COX-2) were analyzed in vitro in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human macrophage (U937). TNF-α and IL-1 levels in the serum samples of arthritic rats were also measured using an ELISA kit. RESULTS: Treatment with EOS resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of paw edema in acute and chronic models of inflammation. It also inhibited significantly the production of TNF-α, IL-1 COX-1, and COX-2 in the LPS-stimulated U937 macrophages. EOS significantly suppressed FCA-induced paw edema as well as the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-1. X-rays of the synovial joint of the hind leg showed considerable improvement in joint integrity and recovery of tibia-talus bones from degeneration and osteoporotic lesions. Histology of proximal interphalangeal joints of EOS-treated animals showed obvious protection of cartilage and soft tissue. Finally, FMT analysis strongly supported the anti-arthritic effect of EOS. EOS had high phenolic and total flavonoid content as well as strong antioxidant activity. CONCLUSIONS: Results illustrated that the anti-arthritic properties of O. stamineus could be beneficial for prevention and management of rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory disorders. Illustration of the Anti- arthritis efficacy of Orthosiphon Stamineus standardized extract.",

      "abstract": "Antiapoptotic and antioxidant activities of aqueous-methanolic extract (CAME) of Orthosiphonstamineus Benth(OS), and its hexane (HF), chloroform (CF), n-butanol (NBF), ethyl acetate (EAF) and water (WF) fractions were investigated. Antioxidant properties were evaluated using the assays of Folin-Ciocalteu, aluminiumtrichloride, β-carotene bleaching and DPPH. The role of OS against hydrogen peroxide induced apoptosis on MDA-M231 epithelial cells was examined using MTT assay, phase contrast microscope, colorimetric assay of caspase-3, western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. Results showed that EAF showed the highest total phenolic content followed by CAME, NBF, WF, CF and HF, respectively. Flavonoid content was in the order of the CF > EAF > HF > CAME > NBF > WF. The IC(50) values on DPPH assay for different extract/fractions were 126.2 ± 23, 31.25 ± 1.2, 15.25 ± 2.3, 13.56 ± 1.9, 23.0 ± 3.2, and 16.66 ± 1.5 μg/ml for HF, CF, EAF, NBF, WF and CAME, respectively. OSreduced the oxidation of β-carotene by hydroperoxides. Cell death was dose-dependently inhibited by pretreatment with OS. Caspase-3 and distinct morphological features suggest the anti-apoptotic activities of OS. This plant not only increased the expression of Bcl-2, but also decreased Bax expression, and ultimately reduced H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. The current results showed that phenolics may provide health and nutritional benefits."
