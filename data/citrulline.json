      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In large clinical trials, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have improved prognosis in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Although several beneficial pharmacological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors for HFpEF have been suggested, their presumed metabolic pathways remain insufficiently proven. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the metabolomic profile, determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, of 16 patients with HFpEF before and after empagliflozin therapy. Only citrulline levels (expressed as a ratio to methionine sulfone levels) were significantly elevated after therapy (3.57±1.88 vs. 6.47±3.78; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin significantly increased citrulline levels in HFpEF patients. Although further studies are needed, it would be intriguing if this metabolite change were related to the cardiovascular protective effects of empagliflozin.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lactational performance depends heavily on age, health, and nutrition. L-Citrulline (Cit) is an effective precursor of L-arginine (Arg), an amino acid that has important roles in synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and polyamines. Ruminal microbes degrade extracellular Arg; however, extracellular L-citrulline (Cit) is not degraded by ruminal microbes due to lack of uptake and can be fed unencapsulated as a precursor for Arg. As NO is a vasodilator, an increase in blood flow and transport of molecules to mammary tissue may enhance lactational performance and milk composition. Increases in polyamine production may increase milk protein synthesis within mammary tissue, thus increasing milk protein content. This study determined, for the first time, effects of dietary Cit supplementation on milk production and milk composition of Alpine dairy goats. METHODS: Does were synchronized to estrus and bred to Alpine bucks. Parturition was induced on d 149 of gestation and does were suckled overnight allowing kid(s) to obtain colostrum before being milked 24 h later (d 1 of lactation). Does were assigned to either control (CON, n = 24) or Cit (CIT, n = 23) diets. The isonitrogenous control diet consisted of 97.63% basal diet and 2.37% supplement (1.37% L-alanine and 1.00% soybean hydrogenated oil). The CIT supplemented diet consisted of 97.63% basal diet and 2.37% supplement (0.5% Cit, 0.5% L-glutamine, 1% soybean hydrogenated oil, 0.37% cornstarch). Diets were group fed ad-libitum by treatment group. Blood samples were collected on d 0 and 30 of lactation, milk volumes measured twice daily, and on d 10, 20, and 40 of lactation, milk samples were collected. RESULTS: CIT-treated does had greater daily milk production (P < 0.05) and there was an effect of day of lactation on daily milk production (P < 0.0001). Sire had significant effect on daily milk production as well (P < 0.05). Milk compositional analyses revealed Cit supplementation increased solid-non-fat (SNF; P < 0.05) and protein (P < 0.05) content in milk. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel results indicate that dietary supplementation of Cit fed ad-libitum in Alpine does increased daily milk yield, milk SNF content, and protein content. Supplemental Cit may be a proxy for Arg in goats to enhance lactational performance."

      "abstract": "We previously observed elevated plasma levels of citrulline and arginine in diabetic retinopathy patients compared to diabetic controls. We tested our hypothesis that citrulline plus arginine induces angiogenesis and increases permeability in retinal endothelial cells. Human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) were treated with citrulline, arginine, or citrulline + arginine, and angiogenesis was measured with cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation assays. Permeability was measured in HRMEC monolayers via trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and FITC-labeled dextran. We also measured arginase activity, arginase-1 and arginase-2 expression, protein expression and phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and nitric oxide (NO) production. Citrulline + arginine induced endothelial cell proliferation (p = 0.018), migration (p = 0.011), and tube formation (p = 0.0042). Citrulline + arginine also increased FITC-dextran flow-through (p = 1.5 × 10-5) and decreased TEER (p = 0.010). Citrulline + arginine had no effect on arginase activity, but it increased eNOS (p = 6.3 × 10-4) and phosphorylated eNOS (p = 0.029), as well as NO production (p = 0.025). Inhibiting eNOS prevented the increase in NO (p = 0.0092), inhibited citrulline + arginine-induced cell migration (p = 0.0080) and tube formation (p = 0.0092), and blocked citrulline + arginine-related alterations in FITC-dextran flow-through (p = 3.6 × 10-4) and TEER (p = 3.9 × 10-4). These data suggest that citrulline + arginine treatment induces angiogenesis and increases permeability in retinal endothelial cells by activating eNOS and increasing NO production.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic dysregulation and altered metabolite concentrations are widely recognized as key characteristics of aging. Comprehensive exploration of endogenous metabolites that drive aging remains insufficient. Here, we conducted an untargeted metabolomics analysis of aging mice, revealing citrulline as a consistently down-regulated metabolite associated with aging. Systematic investigations demonstrated that citrulline exhibited antiaging effects by reducing cellular senescence, protecting against DNA damage, preventing cell cycle arrest, modulating macrophage metabolism, and mitigating inflammaging. Long-term citrulline supplementation in aged mice yielded beneficial effects and ameliorated age-associated phenotypes. We further elucidated that citrulline acts as an endogenous metabolite antagonist to inflammation, suppressing proinflammatory responses in macrophages. Mechanistically, citrulline served as a potential inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in macrophage and regulated the mTOR-hypoxia-inducible factor 1α-glycolysis signaling pathway to counter inflammation and aging. These findings underscore the significance of citrulline deficiency as a driver of aging, highlighting citrulline supplementation as a promising therapeutic intervention to counteract aging-related changes.",

      "abstract": "Poultry lacks carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, which is a key enzyme in the endogenous synthesis of arginine, thus poultry must obtain arginine from their diet. Citrulline (L-Cit), as a precursor of arginine, produces the same biological effects as arginine, and may even be more effective. In these experiments, we discovered that the addition of L-Cit significantly increased production performance, antioxidant and immune properties, and modulated the intestinal microbiota. The study involved 240 1-day-old male yellow-feathered broilers randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: control (CON), 0.5% L-Cit, 1% L-Cit, and 1.5% L-Cit, with 10 replicates per group and six birds per replicate. The feeding trial lasted for 63 days. The body weight at 42 days and 63 days, as well as the average daily weight gain from day 1 to 63, increased linearly and quadratically with the addition of L-citrulline. The plasma concentrations of citrulline, ornithine, and arginine increased linearly with the dose of L-Cit. L-citrulline increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and decreased interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Dietary addition of 1% L-Cit also significantly altered the overall composition of the broiler intestinal microbiota, increasing the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 while reducing the relative abundance of Synergistota and Campylobacterota. This indicates that L-Cit can enhance the production performance of broilers, and improve antioxidant activity and immune functions, thereby protecting intestinal health. The optimum dietary amount of L-Cit is 1 to 1.5%."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Athletes often use sport supplements to improve their physical and physiological performance. This randomized, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of combined versus single supplementation of creatine (Cr), beta-alanine (BA), and L-citrulline (L-Cit) during short sprint interval training (SSIT) on basketball players' physical and physiological performance over a period of 28 days. METHODS: Forty-eight basketball players were equally assigned to 6 groups of Cr (0.1 g/kg of Cr monohydrate daily), BA (4.8 g daily), L-Cit (6 g daily), combined supplementation, PL, and an active control group, and each group consisted of 8 participants. The training groups participated in SSIT (3 sets of 10 repetitions of 5-s all-out runs) sessions 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Physical (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Illinois change of direction) and physiological (Wingate anaerobic power and cardiorespiratory fitness test) performance were evaluated before and after the training period. RESULTS: All training groups (Cr, BA, L-Cit, combined, and PL) showed significant improvements in physical and physiological performance over the 4-week intervention (P < .05). Interestingly, the supplement groups displayed significantly (P = .001) greater changes than the PL group, indicating better outcomes in performance adaptations. However, significant differences in performance variables were observed among the supplement groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that short-term supplementation with Cr, BA, and L-Cit, as well as a combination of them during SSIT, can significantly improve the physical and physiological performance of basketball players compared to a PL.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The widespread application of nuclear technology has markedly heightened the risk of extensive, uncontrolled exposure to radiation. Nevertheless, in contrast to external irradiation, the biological impacts and countermeasures against internal irradiation from radionuclides remain inadequately characterized. METHODS: Mice were administered yttrium-90 (Y90) carbon microspheres via gavage at different dosages (0-5.0 mCi) to establish a radionuclides exposure model. A multi-omics analysis was employed to access alterations in gut microbiota, fecal and colonic metabolites profiles, and intestinal mRNA expression post-irradiation. The function of significant metabolite was validated at both cellular levels and organismal levels. Additionally, ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq techniques were utilized to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the actions of key metabolite. RESULTS: Exposure to Y90 resulted in intestinal damage and hematological impairment. Multi-omics analysis revealed significant alternations of gut microbiota, fecal metabolites, colonic metabolites, and intestinal mRNA expression following internal radiation exposure. Notably, L-citrulline was identified as a metabolite with changes observed in both fecal and colonic tissues, demonstrating radioprotective properties in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, L-citrulline facilitated the citrullination of histone H3 at the 17th site (H3Cit17), and multiple mRNAs including C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (Cxcl3), were transcriptionally regulated by H3Cit17 post L-citrulline treatment. Furthermore, Cxcl3 conferred protective effects for intestinal epithelial cells against ionizing radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The research offers critical perspectives on the intestinal and gut microbiota's reaction to radionuclides exposure. It underscores the promise of L-citrulline as a radioprotective compound, which may have substantial ramifications for the formulation of strategies to mitigate radiation exposure.",

Following an educational challenge, ERNDIM provided a mass spectrum of the 'trimethylsilyl derivative of cyclic derivative of citrulline' to participating laboratories. Though there is knowledge among some in the biochemical genetics' community, that the cyclic derivative of citrulline can be identified in urine of patients with citrullinemia type I, we could not find any published literature regarding this analyte in patient samples, nor were able to obtain any standard material. We did note two publications that proposed chemical structures for the cyclic derivative of citrulline, but neither suggested a clinical utility for this compound and the two proposed structures differed. Here, we used the mass spectrum provided by ERNDIM to retrospectively evaluate existing urine organic acids data from patients affected with conditions associated with elevated levels of plasma citrulline to learn more about this marker in urine and to correlate it with plasma citrulline data in diagnostic and follow-up samples. We document a positive correlation between the concentration of this compound in patient urine and the concentration of citrulline in concurrently collected plasma. We establish that this analyte is a good marker for citrullinemia type I but is not unique to this condition. Finally, we correlate the mass spectrum with the chemical structure originally proposed by Wilson et al. in 1978.",

A metabolomics analysis discovered fecal metabolites with anti-inflammatory effects in CDI. We aimed to identify an anti-CDI metabolite that can inhibit CDI-mediated colitis and prevent recurrence. METHODS: Fresh human colonic tissues and primary human cells were used to determine metabolite effects. Humanized C. difficile-infected HuCD34-NCG mice and antibiotics-treated human gut microbiota-treated (ABX + HGM) hamsters were used to simulate the human environment. RESULTS: High-throughput screening and fecal metabolomics analysis identified anti-inflammatory metabolites. Compared with other tested metabolites, citrulline preserved the mucosal integrity of toxin-exposed fresh human colonic tissues with reduced macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1a) and increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression. Oral citrulline treatment alleviated cecal inflammation in hamsters infected with C. difficile ribotype 027. This was accomplished by the augmented expression of cecal IL-10 and the diminished level of cecal MIP-1a. Citrulline and vancomycin synergistically prevented recurrence in the infected ABX + HGM hamsters. In C57BL/6J mice infected with C. difficile VPI10463, citrulline ameliorated colitis by reducing colonic Ccl3 mRNA expression. In immunologically humanized HuCD34-NCG mice infected with toxin B-expressing C. difficile ribotype 017, citrulline ameliorated colitis with increased human IL-10 expression in colonic macrophages. Citrulline suppressed MIP-1a secretion and GSK3a/b dephosphorylation in the toxin A-exposed human colonic epithelial cells and promoted IL-10 expression in toxin B-exposed human macrophages and heat shock protein 27 phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Citrulline exerts anti-inflammatory effects in the intestines against C. difficile toxins and inhibits CDI recurrence in mice and hamsters."

      "abstract": "L-citrulline (L-CIT), a precursor to L-arginine (L-ARG), is a key contributor to the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by deficient nitric oxide synthesis, is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neonatal conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) associated pulmonary hypertension (PH). This review summarizes the current evidence around the possible role of L-CIT supplementation in the treatment of these conditions. Detoxification of endogenously produced superoxide radicals is inadequate in preterm infants due to immature antioxidants that leads to the production of peroxynitrite, a reactive oxygen-free radical that is cytotoxic and causes damage to organelles and cellular membranes, further disrupting the coupling of endothelial NO synthase enzyme and the generation of high levels of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Animal studies in lipopolysaccharide-induced models of chorioamnionitis and hyperoxia- and inflammation-induced BPD-PH in rodent lung models revealed that L-CIT supplementation significantly mitigated structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature, preserved alveolar growth, and increased vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression, highlighting the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of L-CIT supplementation. Similar benefits were noted in newborn piglet models of chronic hypoxia-induced PH and NEC. Pharmacokinetic studies in neonates have shown doses of 100-300 mg/kg/day to be safe and well tolerated. A few studies have shown the beneficial effects of L-CIT supplementation in pulmonary hypertension secondary to congenital heart disease, but evidence of efficacy in the neonatal population is lacking. While L-CIT shows promise in the treatment of various neonatal conditions, adequately powered studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of L-CIT supplementation post-surgical NEC and BPD ± PH in the extremely preterm population are needed to translate this novel therapy to clinical practice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests L-arginine may be effective at reducing pre-eclampsia and related outcomes. However, whether L-arginine can prevent or only treat pre-eclampsia, and thus the target population and timing of initiation, remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of L-arginine and L-citrulline (precursor of L-arginine) on the prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus and the Cochrane Library were searched through 7 February 2024. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials administering L-arginine or L-citrulline to pregnant women, with the comparison group receiving placebo or standard care, were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Meta-analyses were conducted separately for prevention or treatment trials, using random-effects models. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (2028 women) and three non-randomised trials (189 women) were included. The risk of bias was 'high' in eight RCTs and showed 'some concerns' in 12. In prevention trials, L-arginine was associated with a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia (relative risk [RR] 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35, 0.78; low-certainty evidence, four trials) and severe pre-eclampsia (RR 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09, 0.55; low-certainty evidence, three trials). In treatment trials, L-arginine may reduce mean systolic blood pressure (MD -5.64 mmHg; 95% CI, -10.66, -0.62; very low-certainty evidence, three trials) and fetal growth restriction (RR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26, 0.81; low-certainty evidence, two trials). Only one study (36 women) examined L-citrulline and reported no effect on pre-eclampsia or blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: L-arginine may be promising for pre-eclampsia prevention and treatment, but findings should be interpreted cautiously. More trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and time to commence supplementation and support clinical decision-making.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE) contributes to maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Supplementation with L-arginine, the precursor of nitric oxide, has not proven effective, possibly due to extensive arginine catabolism in the splanchnic bed. Citrulline is converted by the kidney to L-arginine. Citrulline, therefore, could be a more effective nitric oxide donor in the treatment of PE. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine whether oral L-citrulline supplementation would prolong the delay between diagnosis and delivery in preeclamptic females. METHODS: A total of 115 females with monofetal preeclamptic pregnancy were enrolled before 36 weeks of gestation in a multicenter randomized, double-blind trial: 58 received oral L-citrulline supplementation, and 57 received placebo. The duration of pregnancy, neonatal and maternal outcomes, and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1/placental growth factor ratio, an index of placental dysfunction, were monitored. RESULTS: Gestational age at inclusion was similar in both groups. The duration of pregnancy between inclusion and delivery was unaltered (hazard ratio: 0.90; 95% confidence interval: 0.62, 1.31). Neither neonatal weight nor pregnancy outcome differed between groups. Liver enzymes were higher on the day of delivery in the treated, compared to the placebo group (65.1 compared with 33.2 UI and 70.4 compared with 33.7 UI for alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, respectively, (estimate: 5.92; 95% confidence interval: 1.09, 10.74). Systolic blood pressure (BP) was higher at delivery in the citrulline group compared with the control group (P = 0.015), whereas the diastolic BP showed no difference. We did not find any difference in neonatal outcomes nor soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1/placental growth factor ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The current trial found no benefit of oral L-citrulline supplementation to females with PE regarding either the duration of pregnancy, fetal growth, or maternal and neonatal outcomes. Systolic BP and liver enzymes levels were found to increase at delivery in the treated group. L-citrulline oral supplementation does not seem to be a promising candidate as a therapeutic intervention in pregnancies with PE. This trial was registered at CITRUPE as NCT02801695.",

      "abstract": "L-citrulline (referred to hereafter as citrulline), a non-essential amino acid and an intermediate in the urea cycle, is widely recognized for its role in managing genetic urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Recent studies, however, suggest that citrulline's therapeutic potential extends beyond UCDs, particularly in conditions associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. This review explores citrulline's emerging applications in sickle cell disease (SCD), post-operative pulmonary hypertension (PH), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), as well as its speculative use in asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In SCD, citrulline may restore NO bioavailability, potentially reducing the incidence and severity of vaso-occlusive crises and preventing complications like pulmonary hypertension. In the context of post-operative PH, citrulline's capacity to enhance NO production can improve pulmonary vascular resistance, decrease right ventricular strain, and reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. Citrulline's protective effects on endothelial function and its ability to mitigate oxidative stress offer promising adjunctive therapy for HVOD, particularly in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. In BPD, citrulline could promote alveolar development, reduce inflammation, and improve long-term respiratory outcomes. Despite these promising findings, further research is necessary to determine optimal dosing strategies and to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety. The potential role of citrulline in modulating NO production in conditions like asthma and ARDS also warrants further investigation. This review underscores the versatile therapeutic potential of citrulline and highlights the need for continued research into its applications across various conditions associated with NO deficiency and endothelial dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: The role of Lactobacillus murinus as a potential probiotic is being explored. Our objectives were to explore the effects of Lactobacillus murinus on insulin resistance and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Insulin resistance animal models were applied to study the effect of L. murinus and the underlying mechanism by six weeks of treatment. Metformin was administered in vitro to analyze the growth and metabolites of L. murinus. Serum metabolites were further analyzed after L. murinus administration. The effect of L-citrulline and the underlying mechanism in alleviating insulin resistance were evaluated. RESULTS: L. murinus not only reduced body weight gain and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) but improved impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and insulin resistance. Moreover, L. murinus inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) while promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory factor (IL-10). Further, L. murinus promoted the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) while inhibited phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). A total of 147 metabolites of L. murinus were identified, in which the content of L-citrulline increased to 7.94 times after metformin regulation. Further, the serum concentration of L-citrulline significantly increased after L. murinus administration. Similarly, L-citrulline reduced body weight gain and PBG, improved IGT and insulin resistance. Additionally, L-citrulline improved inflammation, promoted CPT1 while inhibited PCK and G6Pase. CONCLUSIONS: L. murinus mediated by L-citrulline alleviated insulin resistance via promoting fatty acid oxidation and inhibiting gluconeogenesis, suggesting that supplementation of L. murinus could be a potential therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes related to insulin resistance.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress mediate the pathological progression of diabetic complications, like diabetic retinopathy (DR), peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and impaired wound healing. Studies have shown that treatment with a stable form of arginase 1 that reduces l-arginine levels and increases ornithine and urea limits retinal injury and improves visual function in DR. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of PEGylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) that depletes l-arginine and elevates l-citrulline on diabetic complications in the db/db mouse model of type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: Mice received intraperitoneal (IP), intramuscular (IM), or intravitreal (IVT) injections of ADI-PEG20 or PEG20 as control. Effects on body weight, fasting blood glucose levels, blood-retinal-barrier (BRB) function, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, thermal sensitivity, and wound healing were determined. Studies using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) examined the underlying signaling pathway. RESULTS: Systemic injections of ADI-PEG20 reduced body weight and blood glucose and decreased oxidative stress and inflammation in db/db retinas. These changes were associated with improved BRB and visual function along with thermal sensitivity and wound healing. IVT injections of either ADI-PEG20, anti-VEGF antibody or their combination also improved BRB and visual function. ADI-PEG20 treatment also prevented LPS/IFNℽ-induced activation of BMDM in vitro as did depletion of l-arginine and elevation of l-citrulline. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: ADI-PEG20 treatment limited signs of DR and DPN and enhanced wound healing in db/db mice. Studies using BMDM suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of ADI-PEG20 involve blockade of the JAK2-STAT1 signaling pathway via l-arginine depletion and l-citrulline production.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Palmitic acid (PA), the most abundant saturated free fatty acids, induces apoptosis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MECs). It is suggested that oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are key mechanisms underlying PA-induced cell death. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between ER stress and oxidative stress during PA-induced cell death in mammary alveolar cell-T (MAC-T) cells. Additionally, we examined whether L-citrulline can protect against PA-induced damage of MAC-T cells. METHODS: MAC-T cells were treated with 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) or N-acetyl-Lcysteine (NAC) to inhibit PA-induced ER stress and oxidative stress, respectively. MAC-T cells were pretreated with or without L-citrulline for 48 h followed by PA treatment. Cell viability was measured with MTT assays. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MAC-T cells were assessed using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluores cein diacetate acetyl ester dye. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to explore the regulation of genes associated with oxidative stress, and ER stress genes. Western blotting analysis was also carried out. RESULTS: 4-PBA significantly reduced PA-induced mRNA expressions of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), and intracellular ROS levels. Furthermore, NAC dramatically reduced PA-induced ROS levels and the mRNA expressions of NRF2, ATF4, and CHOP. L-citrulline pretreatment effectively rescued cell viability decreased by PA. Moreover, L-citrulline pretreatment significantly downregulated the PA-induced upregulation of GRP78, ATF4, and CHOP mRNA expression, and protein expression of p-PERK and cleaved caspase-3. PA increased intracellular ROS levels and NRF2 mRNA expression, whereas L-citrulline pretreatment remarkably reduced these levels. CONCLUSION: Both ER and oxidative stresses interact during PA-induced cell death in MAC-T cells, and L-citrulline could attenuate this cell death by inhibiting ER and oxidative stresses. Therefore, L-citrulline may be a promising supplement for protecting against PA-induced cell death in bovine MECs during the lactation period of dairy cows."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid that is depleted in critically ill or surgical patients. In pediatric and adult patients, sepsis results in an arginine-deficient state, and the depletion of plasma arginine is associated with greater mortality. However, direct supplementation of arginine can result in the excessive production of nitric oxide (NO), which can contribute to the hypotension and macrovascular hypo-reactivity observed in septic shock. Pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20, pegargiminase) reduces plasma arginine and generates citrulline that can be transported intracellularly to generate local arginine and NO, without resulting in hypotension, while maintaining microvascular patency. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of ADI-PEG20 with and without supplemental intravenous citrulline in mitigating hypovolemic shock, maintaining tissue levels of arginine, and reducing systemic inflammation in an endotoxemic pediatric pig model. METHODS: Twenty 3-week-old crossbred piglets were implanted with jugular and carotid catheters as well as telemetry devices in the femoral artery to measure blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, and respiration rate. The piglets were assigned to one of three treatments before undergoing a 5 h lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infusion protocol. Twenty-four hours before LPS infusion, control pigs (LPS; n=6) received saline, ADI-PEG20 pigs (n=7) received an injection of ADI-PEG20, and seven pigs (ADI-PEG20 + CIT pigs [n=7]) received ADI-PEG20 and 250 mg/kg citrulline intravenously. Pigs were monitored throughout LPS infusion and tissue was harvested at the end of the protocol. RESULTS: Plasma arginine levels decreased and remained low in ADI-PEG20 + CIT and ADI-PEG20 pigs compared with LPS pigs but tissue arginine levels in the liver and kidney were similar across all treatments. Mean arterial pressure in all groups decreased from 90 mmHg to 60 mmHg within 1 h of LPS infusion but there were no significant differences between treatment groups. ADI-PEG20 and ADI-PEG20 + CIT pigs had less CD45+ infiltrate in the liver and lung and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma. CONCLUSION: ADI-PEG20 and citrulline supplementation failed to ameliorate the hypotension associated with acute endotoxic sepsis in pigs but reduced systemic and local inflammation in the lung and liver.",

Clinical data and serum samples were prospectively collected from 100 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between July 2020 and August 2021. Patients with COVID-19 were categorized into three groups for analysis based on lung infiltrates, oxygen inhalation upon admission, and the initiation of oxygen therapy after admission. Blood data, oxidative stress-related biomarkers, and serum amino acid levels upon admission were compared in these groups. Patients with lung infiltrations requiring oxygen therapy upon admission or starting oxygen post-admission exhibited higher serum levels of hydroperoxides and lower levels of citrulline compared to the control group. No remarkable differences were observed in nitrite/nitrate, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and arginine levels. Serum citrulline levels correlated significantly with serum lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels. A significant negative correlation was found between serum levels of citrulline and hydroperoxides. Levels of hydroperoxides decreased, and citrulline levels increased during the recovery period compared to admission. Patients with COVID-19 with extensive pneumonia or poor oxygenation showed increased oxidative stress and reduced citrulline levels in the blood compared to those with fewer pulmonary complications. These findings suggest that combined oxidative stress and abnormal citrulline metabolism may play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

We obtained blood samples at baseline and 12 weeks and assessed the plasma amino acid profile by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry liquid chromatography. We also calculated the Fischer ratio (the ratio of branched-chain to aromatic amino acids). RESULTS: In the empagliflozin group but not in the control group, plasma levels of citrulline, histidine, and α-aminobutyric acid (AABA), the Fischer ratio, and serum high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin increased significantly (p = 0.0099, 0.0277, 0.0318, 0.0135, and 0.0304, respectively) and plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) decreased significantly (p = 0.0014).

      "abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) is one of the major malignant diseases threatening human health. The study aimed to identify the effect of citrulline on the malignant phenotype of LC cells and to further disclose the potential molecular mechanism of citrulline in regulating the development of LC, providing a novel molecular biological basis for the clinical treatment of LC. The effects of citrulline on the viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of LC cells (A549, H1299) were validated by CCK-8, colony formation, EdU, and transwell assays. The cell glycolysis was assessed via determining the glucose uptake, lactate production, ATP levels, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). RNA-seq and molecular docking were performed to screen for citrulline-binding target proteins. Western blotting experiments were conducted to examine the expression of related signaling pathway molecules. In addition, the impacts of citrulline on LC growth in vivo were investigated by constructing mouse models. Citrulline augmented the viability of LC cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The proliferation, migration, invasion, glycolysis, and EMT processes of LC cells were substantially enhanced after citrulline treatment. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that citrulline could bind to RAB3C protein. Western blotting results indicated that citrulline activated the IL-6/STAT3 pathway by binding to RAB3C. In addition, animal experiments disclosed that citrulline promoted tumor growth in mice. Citrulline accelerated the glycolysis and activated the IL6/STAT3 pathway through the RAB3C protein, consequently facilitating the development of LC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: L-Arginine (Arg) is an essential amino acid and a precursor for the synthesis of vascular nitric oxide, while L-Citrulline is a non-essential amino acid substrate for increasing L-arginine. Both L-arginine and L-Citrulline in translational studies may acutely lower the blood pressure. Current meta-analysis for L-arginine or L-Citrulline interventions in blood pressure have identified significant heterogeneity. Clinical trial evidence for L-arginine or L-Citrulline in chronic blood pressure reduction in the general population requires an examination of trial designs, as not all translational studies may have influenced vascular reactivity. Our aims are to explore whether L-arginine and L-citrulline intervention trials in chronic blood pressure consider standardized end points relevant to the general adult populations. METHODS: A step-wise search on clinicaltrials.gov, the U.S. Library of Medicine registry for clinical trials, was performed including the following keyword search parameters: \"completed\" \"L-Citrulline\" \"L-arginine\" trial\", and \"adults\", involving \"blood pressure\" reduction as a primary end point in adult humans. RESULTS: Of the forty-four completed trials, only five were included for analysis. Following the careful evaluation of trial design, we observed heterogeneity across participant inclusion criteria (population sample size, age range, sex), interventional design (dosages, duration), and primary outcomes, measured with respect to changes in diastolic or systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there is a lack of robust trial design evidence to suggest that L-arginine or L-Citrulline, based on current RCTs in the general population, have an overall positive effect on vascular endothelial reactivity and a beneficial chronic blood pressure-lowering effect. Indeed, conclusions drawn from human meta-analysis studies have been heterogenous between studies, which may be attributed to study design heterogeneity, including differences in sample population, age, and blood pressure at the time of entry. Inconsistencies in the study design poses a challenge for systematic reviews and meta-analysis to accurately assess the effect size and impact of L-arginine or L-citrulline on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Oxidative stress caused by iron overload tends to result in intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction and intestinal microbiota imbalance. As a neutral and nonprotein amino acid, L-Citrulline (L-cit) has been implicated in antioxidant and mitochondrial amelioration properties. This study investigates whether L-cit can alleviate iron overload-induced intestinal injury and explores the underlying mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice are intraperitoneally injected with iron dextran, then gavaged with different dose of L-cit for 2 weeks. L-cit treatment significantly alleviates intestine pathological injury, oxidative stress, ATP level, and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activities, accompanied by ameliorating mitochondrial quality control. L-cit-mediated protection is associated with the upregulation of Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression, inhibition Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated ferritinophagy and ferroptosis, and improvement of gut microbiota. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, Intestinal Porcine Epithelial Cell line-J2 (IPEC-J2) cells are treated with L-cit or AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) inhibitor. AMPK signaling has been activated by L-cit. Notably, Compound C abolishes L-cit's protection on intestinal barrier, mitochondrial function, and antioxidative capacity in IPEC-J2 cells. CONCLUSION: L-cit may restrain ferritinophagy and ferroptosis to regulate iron metabolism, and induce AMPK pathway activation, which contributes to exert antioxidation, ameliorate iron metabolism and mitochondrial quality control, and improve intestinal microbiota. L-cit is a promising therapeutic strategy for iron overload-induced intestinal injury.",

      "abstract": "Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiencies are rare urea cycle disorders, which can lead to life-threatening hyperammonemia. Liver transplantation (LT) provides a cure and offers an alternative to medical treatment and life-long dietary restrictions with permanent impending risk of hyperammonemia. Nevertheless, in most patients, metabolic aberrations persist after LT, especially low plasma citrulline levels, with questionable clinical impact. So far, little is known about these alterations and there is no consensus, whether l-citrulline substitution after LT improves patients' symptoms and outcomes. In this multicentre, retrospective, observational study of 24 patients who underwent LT for CPS1 (n = 11) or OTC (n = 13) deficiency, 25% did not receive l-citrulline or arginine substitution. Correlation analysis revealed no correlation between substitution dosage and citrulline levels (CPS1, p = 0.8 and OTC, p = 1). Arginine levels after liver transplantation were normal after LT independent of citrulline substitution. Native liver survival had no impact on mental impairment (p = 0.67). Regression analysis showed no correlation between l-citrulline substitution and failure to thrive (p = 0.611) or neurological outcome (p = 0.701). Peak ammonia had a significant effect on mental impairment (p = 0.017). Peak plasma ammonia levels correlate with mental impairment after LT in CPS1 and OTC deficiency. Growth and intellectual impairment after LT are not significantly associated with l-citrulline substitution.",

      "abstract": "The growing recognition of the association between maternal chronic kidney disease (CKD) and fetal programming highlights the increased vulnerability of hypertension in offspring. Potential mechanisms involve oxidative stress, dysbiosis in gut microbiota, and activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Our prior investigation showed that the administration of adenine to pregnant rats resulted in the development of CKD, ultimately causing hypertension in their adult offspring. Citrulline, known for enhancing nitric oxide (NO) production and possessing antioxidant and antihypertensive properties, was explored for its potential to reverse high blood pressure (BP) in offspring born to CKD dams. Male rat offspring, both from normal and adenine-induced CKD models, were randomly assigned to four groups (8 animals each): (1) control, (2) CKD, (3) citrulline-treated control rats, and (4) citrulline-treated CKD rats. Citrulline supplementation successfully reversed elevated BP in male progeny born to uremic mothers. The protective effects of perinatal citrulline supplementation were linked to an enhanced NO pathway, decreased expression of renal (pro)renin receptor, and changes in gut microbiota composition. Citrulline supplementation led to a reduction in the abundance of Monoglobus and Streptococcus genera and an increase in Agothobacterium Butyriciproducens. Citrulline's ability to influence taxa associated with hypertension may be linked to its protective effects against maternal CKD-induced offspring hypertension. In conclusion, perinatal citrulline treatment increased NO availability and mitigated elevated BP in rat offspring from uremic mother rats.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Intestinal ischemia and reperfusion (IIR) injury is closely associated with oxidative stress. Evidence shows that oral supplementation with glutamine and citrulline alleviates IIR-induced jejunal damage. We investigated the effects of a combination of glutamine, citrulline, and antioxidant vitamins on IIR-induced jejunal damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation. METHOD: Male Wistar rats that underwent 60 min of superior mesenteric artery occlusion were orally administered glutamine plus citrulline (GC), vitamin C plus E (CE), or a combination of GC and CE 15 min before and 3, 9, and 21 h after reperfusion. Healthy rats without IIR were used as controls. RESULTS: After reperfusion for 24 h, rats with IIR showed lower levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, serum glucose, and jejunal DNA and increased white blood cell counts compared to controls (1-way ANOVA with the least significant difference, P < 0.05). The IIR-induced decrease in serum albumin and increase in plasma interleukin-6 and jejunal thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were significantly reversed by GC and/or CE. The results of the 2-way ANOVA indicated that GC was the main factor that increased jejunal villus height and muscularis DNA, and CE was the main factor that increased jejunal muscularis protein and decreased jejunal proinflammatory cytokine levels and myeloperoxidase activity. In addition, GC and CE are the main factors that decrease plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels and the jejunal apoptotic index. CONCLUSION: Oral post-treatment supplementation with glutamine and citrulline, combined with vitamins C and E, may alleviate IIR-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and jejunal damage.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Liver transplantation (LTx) is an intervention when medical management is not sufficiently preventing individuals with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) from the occurrence of hyperammonemic events. Supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine is regularly performed prior to LTx to support ureagenesis and is often continued after the intervention. However, systematic studies assessing the impact of long-term L-citrulline/arginine supplementation in individuals who have undergone LTx is lacking to date. METHODS: Using longitudinal data collected systematically, a comparative analysis was carried out by studying the effects of long-term L-citrulline/arginine supplementation vs. no supplementation on health-related outcome parameters (i.e., anthropometric, neurological, and cognitive outcomes) in individuals with UCDs who have undergone LTx. Altogether, 52 individuals with male ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, citrullinemia type 1 and argininosuccinic aciduria and a pre-transplant \"severe\" disease course who have undergone LTx were investigated by using recently established and validated genotype-specific in vitro enzyme activities. RESULTS: Long-term supplementation of individuals with L-citrulline/arginine who have undergone LTx (n = 16) does neither appear to alter anthropometric nor neurocognitive endpoints when compared to their severity-adjusted counterparts that were not supplemented (n = 36) after LTx with mean observation periods between four to five years. Moreover, supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine was not associated with an increase of disease-specific plasma arithmetic mean values for the respective amino acids when compared to the non-supplemented control cohort. CONCLUSION: Although supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine is often continued after LTx, this pilot study does neither identify altered long-term anthropometric or neurocognitive health-related outcomes nor does it find an adequate biochemical response as reflected by the unaltered plasma arithmetic mean values for L-citrulline or L-arginine. Further prospective analyses in larger samples and even longer observation periods will provide more insight into the usefulness of long-term supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine for individuals with UCDs who have undergone LTx.",

MAIN METHODS: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) was induced using a high-fat diet followed by low-dose of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg) injection. Male and female Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 6/group): Control, control+Cit, T2D, and T2D + Cit. Cit (4 g/L in drinking water) was administered for 8 weeks. Obesity indices were recorded, serum fasting glucose and lipid profile were measured, and glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests were performed during the Cit intervention. White (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues were weighted, and the adiposity index was calculated at the end of the study. KEY FINDINGS: Cit was more effective in decreasing fasting glucose (18 % vs. 11 %, P = 0.0100), triglyceride (20 % vs. 14 %, P = 0.0173), and total cholesterol (16 % vs. 11 %, P = 0.0200) as well as decreasing gluconeogenesis and improving glucose tolerance, in females compared to male rats with T2D. Following Cit administration, decreases in WAT weight (16 % vs. 14 % for gonadal, 21 % vs. 16 % for inguinal, and 18 % vs. 13 % for retroperitoneal weight, all P < 0.0001) and increases in BAT weight (58 % vs. 19 %, for interscapular and 10 % vs. 7 % for axillary, all P < 0.0001) were higher in females than male rats with T2D. The decrease in adiposity index was also higher (11 % vs. 9 %, P = 0.0007) in females.

      "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that causes progressive paralysis. L-Citrulline is a non-essential neutral amino acid produced by L-arginine via nitric oxide synthase (NOS). According to previous studies, the pathogenesis of ALS entails glutamate toxicity, oxidative stress, protein misfolding, and neurofilament disruption. In addition, L-citrulline prevents neuronal cell death in brain ischemia; therefore, we investigated the change in the transport of L-citrulline under various pathological conditions in a cell line model of ALS. We examined the uptake of [14C]L-citrulline in wild-type (hSOD1wt/WT) and mutant NSC-34/ SOD1G93A (MT) cell lines. The cell viability was determined via MTT assay. A transport study was performed to determine the uptake of [14C]L-citrulline. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to determine the expression levels of rat large neutral amino acid transported 1 (rLAT1) in ALS cell lines. Nitric oxide (NO) assay was performed using Griess reagent. L-Citrulline had a restorative effect on glutamate induced cell death, and increased [14C]L-citrulline uptake and mRNA levels of the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1) in the glutamate-treated ALS disease model (MT). NO levels increased significantly when MT cells were pretreated with glutamate for 24 h and restored by co-treatment with L-citrulline. Co-treatment of MT cells with L-arginine, an NO donor, increased NO levels. NSC-34 cells exposed to high glucose conditions showed a significant increase in [14C]L-citrulline uptake and LAT1 mRNA expression levels, which were restored to normal levels upon co-treatment with unlabeled L-citrulline. In contrast, exposure of the MT cell line to tumor necrosis factor alpha, lipopolysaccharides, and hypertonic condition decreased the uptake significantly which was restored to the normal level by co-treating with unlabeled L-citrulline. L-Citrulline can restore NO levels and cellular uptake in ALS-affected cells with glutamate cytotoxicity, pro-inflammatory cytokines, or other pathological states, suggesting that L-citrulline supplementation in ALS may play a key role in providing neuroprotection."

L-citrulline potentially prevents skeletal muscle damage after acute eccentric exercise. This study aimed to assess the dose-response effect of L-citrulline as a preventive therapy for skeletal muscle damage in mice after acute eccentric exercise. METHODS: This is a controlled laboratory in vivo study with a post-test-only design. Male mice (BALB/c, n = 25) were randomized into the following groups: a normal control (C1) (n = 5); a negative control (C2) with downhill running and placebo intervention (n = 5); treatment groups: T1 (n = 5), T2 (n = 5), and T3 (n = 5), were subjected to downhill running and 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg of L-citrulline, respectively, for seven days. Blood plasma was used to determine the levels of TNNI2 and gastrocnemius muscle tissue NOX2, IL-6, and caspase 3 using ELISA. NF-κB and HSP-70 expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Skeletal muscle damage (plasma TNNI2 levels) in mice after eccentric exercise was lower after 250 and 500 mg/kg of L-citrulline. Further, changes in oxidative stress markers, NOX2, were reduced after a 1,000 mg/kg dose. However, a lower level of change has been observed in levels of cellular response markers (NF-κB, HSP-70, IL-6, and caspase 3) after administration of L-citrulline doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: L-citrulline may prevent skeletal muscle damage in mice after acute eccentric exercise through antioxidant effects as well as inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. In relation to dose-related effects, it was found that L-citrulline doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg significantly influenced the expression of NF-κB and HSP-70, as well as the levels of IL-6 and caspase 3. Meanwhile, only doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg had an impact on TNNI2 levels, and the 1,000 mg/kg dose affected NOX2 levels.",

These SMDCs are distinguished by their cleavable linker modules: one utilizing the widely known valine-citrulline linker, susceptible to cleavage by cathepsin B, and the other featuring a novel acid-labile phosphoramidate-based (PhosAm) linker. Both SMDCs maintained nanomolar affinity to PSMA. Furthermore, we confirmed the selective release of the payload and observed chemotherapeutic efficacy specifically within PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells, while maintaining cell viability in PSMA-negative cells. These findings not only validate the efficacy of our approach but also highlight the potential of the innovative pH-responsive PhosAm linker. This study contributes significantly to the field and also paves the way for future advancements in targeted cancer therapy.",

Here, the effects of L-Cit on lifespan were assessed in C. elegans, while the effects of L-Cit on aging-associated decline were determined in C57BL/6J mice. For lifespan analysis, C. elegans were treated with ±5 mM L-Cit. Twelve-month-old male C57BL/6J mice (n = 8-10/group) fed a standard chow diet received drinking water ± 2.5 g/kg/d L-Cit or 5 g/kg/d hydrolyzed soy protein (Iso-N-control) for 16 or 32 weeks. Additionally, 4-month-old C57BL/6J mice were treated accordingly for 8 weeks. Markers of senescence, glucose tolerance, intestinal barrier function, and intestinal microbiota composition were analyzed in mice. L-Cit treatment significantly extended the lifespan of C. elegans. The significant increase in markers of senescence and signs of impaired glucose tolerance found in 16- and 20-month-old control mice was attenuated in L-Cit-fed mice, which was associated with protection from intestinal barrier dysfunction and a decrease in NO2- levels in the small intestine, while no marked differences in intestinal microbiota composition were found when comparing age-matched groups. Our results suggest that pharmacological doses of L-Cit may have beneficial effects on lifespan in C. elegans and aging-associated decline in mice.",

Based on our single-dose pharmacokinetic study, we evaluated the ability of a multi-dose enteral L-citrulline strategy to achieve a target trough steady-state L-citrulline plasma concentration and its tolerability in premature infants. STUDY DESIGN: Plasma L-citrulline concentrations were measured in six premature infants receiving 60 mg/kg L-citrulline every 6 h for 72 h before the first and last L-citrulline doses. L-citrulline concentrations were compared to concentration-time profiles from our previous study. RESULTS: Target trough plasma L-citrulline concentrations were achieved in 2/6 subjects. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-dose L-citrulline was well tolerated. These results will assist in the design of phase II RCTs evaluating L-citrulline dosage strategies to achieve target plasma L-citrulline concentrations in infants at risk for BPD-PH.

This early-phase randomised feasibility trial assessed the acceptability of L-citrulline supplementation to pregnant women with chronic hypertension and its effects on maternal BP and other vascular outcomes. Pregnant women with chronic hypertension were randomised at 12-16 weeks to receive 3-g L-citrulline twice daily (n = 24) or placebo (n = 12) for 8 weeks. Pregnant women reported high acceptability of oral L-citrulline. Treatment increased maternal plasma levels of citrulline, arginine and the arginine:asymmetric dimethylarginine ratio, particularly in women reporting good compliance. L-citrulline had no effect on diastolic BP (L-citrulline: - 1.82 95% CI (- 5.86, 2.22) vs placebo: - 5.00 95% CI (- 12.76, 2.76)), uterine artery Doppler or angiogenic biomarkers. Although there was no effect on BP, retrospectively, this study was underpowered to detect BP changes < 9 mmHg, limiting the conclusions about biological effects. The increase in arginine:asymmetric dimethylarginine ratio was less than in non-pregnant populations, which likely reflects altered pharmacokinetics of pregnancy, and further pharmacokinetic assessment of L-citrulline in pregnancy is advised.Trial Registration EudraCT 2015-005792-25 (2017-12-22) and ISRCTN12695929 (2018-09-20).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Restoring plasma arginine levels through enteral administration of L-citrulline in critically ill patients may improve outcomes. We aimed to evaluate whether enteral L-citrulline administration reduced organ dysfunction based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and affected selected immune parameters in mechanically ventilated medical intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial of enteral administration of L-citrulline versus placebo for critically ill adult patients under invasive mechanical ventilation without sepsis or septic shock was conducted in four ICUs in France between September 2016 and February 2019. Patients were randomly assigned to receive enteral L-citrulline (5 g) every 12 h for 5 days or isonitrogenous, isocaloric placebo. The primary outcome was the SOFA score on day 7. Secondary outcomes included SOFA score improvement (defined as a decrease in total SOFA score by 2 points or more between day 1 and day 7), secondary infection acquisition, ICU length of stay, plasma amino acid levels, and immune biomarkers on day 3 and day 7 (HLA-DR expression on monocytes and interleukin-6). RESULTS: Of 120 randomized patients (mean age, 60 ± 17 years; 44 [36.7%] women; ICU stay 10 days [IQR, 7-16]; incidence of secondary infections 25 patients (20.8%)), 60 were allocated to L-citrulline and 60 were allocated to placebo. Overall, there was no significant difference in organ dysfunction as assessed by the SOFA score on day 7 after enrollment (4 [IQR, 2-6] in the L-citrulline group vs. 4 [IQR, 2-7] in the placebo group; Mann‒Whitney U test, p = 0.9). Plasma arginine was significantly increased on day 3 in the treatment group, while immune parameters remained unaffected. CONCLUSION: Among mechanically ventilated ICU patients without sepsis or septic shock, enteral L-citrulline administration did not result in a significant difference in SOFA score on day 7 compared to placebo.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of L-citrulline on central and peripheral blood pressure, pulse wave reflection, and central arterial stiffness at rest and during an isometric knee extension exercise protocol. Twelve older males received 6 g of L-citrulline or a placebo for six days using a double-blind crossover design. Blood hemodynamics parameters (i.e., aortic and brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, heart rate), pulse wave reflection (i.e., augmented pressure, augmentation index, forward/backward wave pressure), and arterial stiffness (i.e., carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity) were measured at baseline, post-supplementation, and during isometric exercise. No significant effects of L-citrulline supplementation were observed at rest or during exercise on blood pressure, pulse wave reflection, or arterial stiffness. Both central and peripheral blood pressure were increased during the exercise, which is consistent with isometric contractions. The results of the present study do not support any blood pressure-lowering effect of short-term L-citrulline at rest or during low-intensity isometric exercise compared to the pre-exercise values in older males."

However, research on this approach is limited. Thus, this study performed a meta-analysis review to explore the effects of combined exercise with CIT supplementation on body composition and lower limb function among overweight older adults. The search strategy and manuscript development of this study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Eligible studies were first searched through four databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and EBSCO) from January 2003 until April 2023, followed by screening. The main inclusion criteria for the article selection are as follows: 1) Randomized Controlled Trial studies; 2) Participants aged over 55; 3) Studies involved exercise with CIT supplementation for the experimental group and exercise with Placebo (PLA) supplementation for the control group; 4) Body composition and lower limb function were measured at pre- and post-intervention. Subsequently, the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was utilized to evaluate the selected studies' quality. The Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) was chosen as the suitable effect scale index, and the mean differences of the data from the selected articles were analyzed using Revman 5.4 software with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI). A total of seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were selected for the meta-analysis. The included studies involved 105 males and 198 females, where 157 belonged to the PLA group and 146 from the CIT group. Significant improvements were observed among overweight older adults with CIT supplementation in 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) (P = 0.04, I2 = 4%), SMD (95% CI) = -0.28 (-0.54, -0.01), and Lower Limb Strength (LLS) (P < 0.01, I2 = 30%), SMD (95% CI) = -0.38 (-0.65, -0.12) compared to those with PLA supplementation. Combined exercise with CIT supplementation could be an effective non-pharmaceutical intervention to improve the physical function of overweight older adults by increasing their muscle strength.",

This study was implemented to determine the effects of L-arginine (Arg), guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), and L-citrulline (Cit) supplementation to Arg-deficient reduced-protein diets on bone morphology, strength, and mineralization status of laying hens. Individually housed Hy-Line Brown laying hens were evenly distributed to five dietary treatments with 25 replicates per treatment from 20 to 40 wk of age. Treatments consisted of a standard protein diet (17% crude protein, SP), a reduced-protein diet deficient in Arg (13% crude protein, RP), and RP supplemented with Arg (0.35% Arg, RP-Arg), GAA (0.46% GAA equivalent to 0.35% Arg, RP-GAA), or Cit (0.35% Cit equivalent to 0.35% Arg, RP-Cit) to reach the Arg level of SP diets. Birds fed the SP diet had similar bone weight, ash, length, width, Seedor index, breaking strength, and serum mineral concentration, but higher toe B level (P < 0.001) compared to those fed the RP diet at wk 40. Birds fed the SP diet consumed more but also excreted more K and B compared to those fed the RP diet (P < 0.01). Birds fed the SP diet had lower Cu digestibility (P = 0.01) and higher B retention (P < 0.01) compared to those offered the RP diet. Supplementation of Arg, GAA, and Cit to the RP diet increased relative femur weight and length (P < 0.001). Citrulline supplementation also increased relative tibia and femur ash, and Zn digestibility (P < 0.05). Supplementation of GAA to the RP diet decreased serum Ca, P, and Mg levels, decreased tibia Fe and Mg levels and toe Mg level, but increased Al, Fe, Zn, and Mn digestibility (P < 0.05). The current findings demonstrated the capacity of laying hens to adapt to low mineral intake by increasing mineral utilization. Overall, bone morphology and breaking strength, and serum mineral level in laying hens were not influenced by dietary CP levels. Dietary Arg, GAA, or Cit supplementation were effective in improving bone morphology and mineralization in laying hens fed Arg-deficient RP diets."

This study retrospectively reviewed clinical and biological data from patients with UCDs treated with citrulline and/or arginine at a reference center since 1990. The aim was to describe the prescription, impact, and safety of these therapies. Data collection included patient background, treatment details, changes in biochemical parameters (plasma ammonia and amino acids concentrations), decompensations, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 79 patients (median age at diagnosis, 0.9 months) received citrulline and/or arginine in combination with a restricted protein diet, most with ornithine transcarbamylase (n = 57, 73%) or carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (n = 15, 19%) deficiencies. Most patients also received ammonium scavengers. Median follow-up was 9.5 years and median exposure to first treatment with arginine + citrulline, citrulline monotherapy, or arginine monotherapy was 5.5, 2.5, or 0.3 years, respectively. During follow-up, arginine or citrulline was administered at least once (as monotherapy or in combination) in the same proportion of patients (86.1%); the overall median duration of exposure was 5.9 years for arginine + citrulline, 3.1 years for citrulline monotherapy, and 0.6 years for arginine monotherapy. The most common switch was from monotherapy to combination therapy (41 of 75 switches, 54.7%). During treatment, mean ammonia concentrations were 35.9 µmol/L with citrulline, 49.8 µmol/L with arginine, and 53.0 µmol/L with arginine + citrulline. Mean plasma arginine concentrations increased significantly from the beginning to the end of citrulline treatment periods (from 67.6 µmol/L to 84.9 µmol/L, P < 0.05). At last evaluation, mean height and weight for age were normal and most patients showed normal or adapted behavior (98.7%) and normal social life (79.0%). Two patients (2.5%) experienced three treatment-related gastrointestinal adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines the importance of citrulline supplementation, either alone or together with arginine, in the management of patients with UCDs. When a monotherapy is considered, citrulline would be the preferred option in terms of increasing plasma arginine concentrations.",

      "abstract": "In preeclampsia, the shallow invasion of cytotrophoblast cells to uterine spiral arteries, leading to a reduction in placental blood flow, is associated with an imbalance of proangiogenic/antiangiogenic factors to impaired nitric oxide (NO) production. Proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF), require NO to induce angiogenesis through antioxidant regulation mechanisms. At the same time, there are increases in antiangiogenic factors in preeclampsia, such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase type 1 receptor (sFIt1) and toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which are mechanism derivates in the reduction of NO bioavailability and oxidative stress in placenta.Different strategies have been proposed to prevent or alleviate the detrimental effects of preeclampsia. However, the only intervention to avoid the severe consequences of the disease is the interruption of pregnancy. In this scenario, different approaches have been analysed to treat preeclamptic pregnant women safely. The supplementation with amino acids is one of them, especially those associated with NO synthesis. In this review, we discuss emerging concepts in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia to highlight L-arginine and L-citrulline supplementation as potential strategies to improve birth outcomes. Clinical and experimental data concerning L-arginine and L-citrulline supplementation have shown benefits in improving NO availability in the placenta and uterine-placental circulation, prolonging pregnancy in patients with gestational hypertension and decreasing maternal blood pressure.",

Our goal was to evaluate the tolerability and ability to achieve a target steady-state L-citrulline plasma concentration in prematures treated enterally with a multi-dose L-citrulline strategy based on our single-dose pharmacokinetic study. STUDY DESIGN: Six prematures received 60 mg/kg of L-citrulline every 6 hours for 72 hours. Plasma L-citrulline concentrations were measured before the first and last L-citrulline doses. L-citrulline concentrations were compared to concentration-time profiles from our previous study. RESULTS: Plasma L-citrulline concentrations agreed with the simulated concentration-time profiles. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Simulations based on single-doses can be used to predict target multi-dose plasma L-citrulline concentrations.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether dynamic monitoring of citrulline (Cit) has guiding value for early enteral nutrition (EN) in patients with severe gastrointestinal injury. METHODS: A observational study was conducted. A total of 76 patients with severe gastrointestinal injury admitted to different intensive care units of Suzhou Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from February 2021 to June 2022 were enrolled. Early EN was performed in 24-48 hours after admission as recommended by the guidelines. Those who did not terminate EN after 7 days were enrolled in the early EN success group, and those who terminated EN within 7 days due to persistent feeding intolerance or deterioration of general condition were enrolled in the early EN failure group. There was no intervention during the treatment. Serum Cit levels were measured by mass spectrometry at admission, before EN starting and EN 24 hours, respectively, and the changes in Cit within EN 24 hours (ΔCit) were calculated (ΔCit = EN 24-hour Cit-Cit before EN starting). Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was plotted to investigate the predictive value of ΔCit for early EN failure, and the optimal predictive value was calculated. Multivariate unconditional Logistic regression was used to analyze the independent risk factors for early EN failure and death at 28 days. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were enrolled in the final analysis, of which 40 succeeded in early EN and 36 failed. There were significant differences in age, main diagnosis, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score at admission, blood lactic acid (Lac) before EN initiation and ΔCit between the two groups. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age [odds ratio (OR) = 0.929, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.874-0.988, P = 0.018], ΔCit (OR = 2.026, 95%CI was 1.322-3.114, P = 0.001) and increased feeding rate within 48 hours (OR = 13.719, 95%CI was 1.795-104.851, P = 0.012) were independent risk factors for early EN failure in patients with severe gastrointestinal injury. ROC curve analysis showed that ΔCit had a good predictive value for early EN failure in patients with severe gastrointestinal injury [area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.787, 95%CI was 0.686-0.887, P < 0.001], and the optimal predictive value of ΔCit was 0.74 μmol/L (sensitivity was 65.0%, specificity was 75.0%). Combined with the optimal predictive value of ΔCit, \"overfeeding\" was defined as ΔCit < 0.74 μmol/L and increased feeding within 48 hours. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age (OR = 0.825, 95%CI was 0.732-0.930, P = 0.002), APACHE II score (OR = 0.696, 95%CI was 0.518-0.936, P = 0.017) and early EN failure (OR = 181.803, 95%CI was 3.916-8 439.606, P = 0.008) were independent risk factors for 28-day death in patients with severe gastrointestinal injury. The new variable \"overfeeding\" was also associated with an increased risk of death at 28 days (OR = 27.816, 95%CI was 1.023-755.996, P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic monitoring of Cit has guiding value for early EN in patients with severe gastrointestinal injury.",

      "abstract": "Physical activity and nutrition play important roles in preventing adverse health outcomes that accompany aging. It has been shown that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) combined with citrulline (CIT) supplementation can improve physical and functional capacities. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum metabolites following a 12-week HIIT combined or not with CIT in obese older adults, and to correlate the metabolic changes with clinico-biological parameters changes. Eighty-six obese older adults completed a 12-week HIIT program combined with a 10 g daily supplementation of either CIT or placebo (PLA) during a double-blinded randomized interventional trial. Only participants with blood samples at T0 (before the intervention) and/or T12 (after the intervention) were included in our sub-analysis (HIIT-PLA-T0: n = 44 and HIIT-PLA-T12: n = 28; HIIT-CIT-T0: n = 39 and HIIT-CIT-T12: n = 42). Serum samples were analyzed by different liquid or gas phase chromatography methods coupled to mass spectrometry. Among the identified metabolites, 44 changed significantly following the 12-week intervention (Time effect), and 10 of them were more affected when HIIT was combined with CIT (Time × Supp effect). Arginine increased significantly due to the 12-week intervention. Correlation analyses demonstrated that decreased triglyceride (TG) (16:1/18:1/16:0) and aspartic acid significantly correlated with a reduction of adiposity-related parameters (fat mass, leg lean mass, leptin, total triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein). Arginine, TG (16:1/18:1/16:0) and aspartic acid might constitute biomarkers of cardiometabolic health and adiposity. Further studies are needed to confirm these associations and understand the underlying mechanisms.Highlights A 12-week intervention involving high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with or without citrulline (CIT) supplementation induced adaptations in the serum metabolome of obese older adults through significant changes in 44 metabolites.Changes in 23 metabolites were observed when a CIT supplementation was administered along with a 12-week HIIT intervention.TG (16:1/18:1/16:0) correlated with several adiposity parameters including leptin, triglycerides, legs lean mass.Aspartic acid correlated with several adiposity parameters including leptin, LDL cholesterol as well as android, arms and trunk fat mass.",

The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was to investigate effects of L-citrulline + Glutathione on aerobic exercise performance and blood flow in well-trained men. METHODS: Twenty-five males (Mean ± SD; Age: 22.2 ± 2.4 yrs; Height: 177.0 ± 4.8 cm; Weight: 75.3 ± 6.9 kg) were randomly assigned to the L-citrulline + Glutathione (Setria Performance Blend: SPB; L-citrulline [2 g] + glutathione [200 mg], 6 capsules) or placebo (PL; 3.1 g cellulose, 6 capsules) group. Participants performed a maximal oxygen consumption treadmill test to determine peak velocity (PV) and returned after eight days of ingesting either PL or SPB. Three timed treadmill runs to exhaustion (TTE) were performed at 90%, 100%, and 110% PV. Brachial artery blood flow and vessel diameter were assessed using ultrasound at 1-hr prior to exercise (1hrPrEX), after each exercise bout, immediately post-exercise (immediate PEX), and 30 minutes post exercise (30minPEX) at visits 2 and 4. Blood analytes were assessed via venous blood draws at visit 1, visit 3, and 1hrPEX, immediate PEX, and 30minPEX at visits 2 and 4. After a 14-day washout, participants repeated the same procedures, ingesting the opposite treatment. Separate repeated measures ANOVAs were performed for TTE, vessel diameter, blood flow, and blood analytes. RESULTS: Blood flow was significantly augmented 30minPEX (p = 0.04) with SPB in comparison with PL. L-citrulline and L-arginine plasma concentrations were significantly elevated immediately PEX (p = 0.001) and 30-minPEX (p = 0.001) following SPB in comparison to PL. CONCLUSION: Acute ingestion of SPB after eight days may enhance blood flow, L-citrulline, and L-arginine plasma concentrations after high-intensity exercise, which may enhance performance.

The l-arginine precursor, l-citrulline, improves NO signaling and has therapeutic potential in PH. However, there is evidence that l-citrulline might increase arginase activity, which in turn, has been shown to contribute to PH. Our major purpose was to determine if l-citrulline increases arginase activity in hypoxic human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs). In addition, to avoid potential adverse effects from high dose l-citrulline monotherapy, we evaluated whether the effect on NO signaling is greater using co-treatment with l-citrulline and another agent that improves NO signaling, folic acid, than either alone. Arginase activity was measured in human PAECs cultured under hypoxic conditions in the presence of l-citrulline (0-1 mM). NO production and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) coupling, as assessed by eNOS dimer-to-monomer ratios, were measured in PAECs treated with l-citrulline and/or folic acid (0.2 μM). Arginase activity increased in hypoxic PAECs treated with 1 mM but not with either 0.05 or 0.1 mM l-citrulline. Co-treatment with folic acid and 0.1 mM l-citrulline increased NO production and eNOS dimer-to-monomer ratios more than treatment with either alone. The potential to increase arginase activity suggests that there might be plasma l-citrulline concentrations that should not be exceeded when using l-citrulline to treat PH. Rather than progressively increasing the dose of l-citrulline as a monotherapy, co-therapy with l-citrulline and folic acid merits consideration, due to the possibility of achieving efficacy at lower doses and minimizing side effects."

Nitric oxide plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of vaso-occlusion. The amino acid, citrulline, is the main endothelial nitric oxide booster that offers the potential to ameliorate vaso-occlusion and decrease the risk of hospitalization. OBJECTIVE: In this two-part study, the goal of the first part is to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous (IV) l-citrulline and optimal dose for the second part of the study, which is to determine the efficacy and tolerability of the intervention in patients with SCD. DESIGN: A phase I/IIA open-label dose-finding study with subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Study of l-citrulline in children and adolescents with SCD presenting to the ED in VOC. METHODS: Part 1: Subjects experiencing VOC are enrolled in an open-label, ascending dose of IV l-citrulline to identify the optimum dose with endpoints of pharmacokinetic parameters, pain scores, reduction of opioid use, quality of life, proportion admitted to the hospital for treatment of pain, readmission rates, and assessment of adverse events. Part 2 of the trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled adaptive \"pick-the-winner\" design to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of IV l-citrulline in patients with SCD while receiving standard of care therapy for VOC. SUMMARY: This ED based sickle cell adaptive trial will determine the optimal dose for IV citrulline and whether the intervention improves outcome as a potential novel therapy for VOC in SCD."

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of L-citrulline, alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMZ-TMP) on acute toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii RH virulent strain. In our study, 60 Swiss albino mice were divided into two main groups; the control group and the infected treated group, which was subdivided into group IIa: infected treated with L-citrulline, group IIb: infected treated with SMZ-TMP, and group IIc: infected treated with L-citrulline combined with SMZ-TMP. The effects of treatment were assessed by parasitological study, electron microscopic study of tachyzoites, and histopathological study of the liver. Moreover, ELISA measurement of the serum level of Interferon-gamma, Interleukin 10, Nitric oxide, and apoptotic markers was used. It was noticed that L-citrulline combined with SMZ-TMP significantly increased the survival time of infected mice with a significant decrease in the number of tachyzoites compared to the other groups. Moreover, it increased the levels of measured cytokines and serum anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and improved the extent of liver cell damage associated with a decrease in inflammatory infiltration. In conclusion, L-citrulline supplementation was found to be effective against acute toxoplasmosis, especially when combined with SMZ-TMP as it has multifactorial mechanisms; nitric oxide production, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and immune stimulator.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Effective parenteral and enteral amino acid replacement is crucial for critically ill patients with altered amino acid metabolism. This study aimed to assess the effects of l-citrulline supplementation on the clinical and laboratory outcomes in critically patients. METHODS: This was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. 82 critically ill patients who were expected to receive mechanical ventilation for more than 72 hours were selected. The patients were assigned to either a placebo or an intervention group. The patients in the placebo group received 10 gr of microcrystalline cellulose and the ones in the intervention group were given l-citrulline daily for 7 days. Serum levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), lipid profile, hepatic enzymes, serum electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated before and after the intervention. Duration of invasive ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ventilator-free days, and 28-day mortality rate were recorded and compared between groups. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients completed the trial. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of age (p = 0.46), sex (p = 0.49), body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.41), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score (p = 0.08), Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) score (p = 0.76), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score (p = 0.58), risk factors (p = 0.13), ICU stay before randomization (p = 0.32), and reason of admission (p = 0.50) before the intervention. Citrulline group had a notable reduction in FBS (p = 0.04), total cholesterol (TC) (p = 0.02), low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) (p <0.001) and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) (p <0.001). Also, a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration (p <0.001) was observed in the intervention group at the end of the trial. Total duration of invasive ventilation and the mean SOFA score on 7th day were significantly lower in the citrulline group compared to the control group. Moreover, a significant increase in days alive and ventilator-free days within 28 days after admission was found in the citrulline group at the end of the trial. Also, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of mortality rate during intervention, serious adverse events, endotracheal intubation, the use of tracheotomy or non-invasive ventilation after extubation, length of ICU stay, ICU-free days at 28 days, and CPIS and APACHE II scores. For mortality, in the citrulline group, there was two deaths compared to eight deaths in the control group. This resulted in an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 14.05% (95% CI: 0.39-27.71%) and a number needed to treat (NNT) of 7.1 (95% CI: 3.6-29.5), regarding mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrated the probable positive effects of citrulline supplementation on lipid profile, hs-CRP levels, duration of invasive ventilation, and SOFA score. Also, l-citrulline consumption may increase the probability of survival without mechanical ventilation."

The objective of this study was to conduct two 4-week clinical trials to evaluate the safety and tolerability of graded dosages of oral ornithine (as hydrochloride) and citrulline. Healthy male adults (n = 60, age 41.4 ± 1.5 years) completed graded dosages of either ornithine hydrochloride (3.2, 6, 9.2, and 12 g/day) or citrulline (6, 12, 18, and 24 g/day) supplement for 4 weeks with 2-week wash-out periods in between. Primary outcomes included vitals, a broad spectrum of circulating biochemical analytes, body weight, sleep quality, and mental self-assessment. In the ornithine hydrochloride supplementation group, minor increase in plasma aspartic acid and glutamic acid concentrations was observed at the highest intake dosages. In the citrulline supplementation group, minor changes in laboratory data for serum lactate dehydrogenase and plasma amino acid concentration of lysine, methionine, threonine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine and ornithine, arginine, and citrulline itself were measured. No other changes in measured parameters were observed, and study subjects tolerated 4-week-long oral supplementation of ornithine hydrochloride or citrulline without treatment-related adverse events. A clinical, no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of ornithine hydrochloride and citrulline supplementation in healthy adult males was determined to be 12 g/day and 24 g/day (4 weeks), respectively.",

However, the role of L-cit in ameliorating oxidative damage and immune dysfunction against iron overload in the thymus remains unclear. This study explored the underlying mechanism of the antioxidant and anti-inflammation qualities of L-cit on iron overload induced in the thymus. We reported that L-cit administration could robustly alleviate thymus histological damage and reduce iron deposition, as evidenced by the elevation of the CD8+ T lymphocyte number and antioxidative capacity. Moreover, the NF-κB pathway, NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy, and ferroptosis were attenuated. We further demonstrated that L-cit supplementation significantly elevated the mTEC1 cells' viability and reversed LDH activity, iron levels, and lipid peroxidation caused by FAC. Importantly, NCOA4 knockdown could reduce the intracellular cytoplasmic ROS, which probably relied on the Nfr2 activation. The results subsequently indicated that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy was required for ferroptosis by showing that NCOA4 knockdown reduced ferroptosis and lipid ROS, accompanied with mitochondrial membrane potential elevation. Intriguingly, L-cit treatment significantly inhibited the NF-κB pathway, which might depend on restraining ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis. Overall, this study indicated that L-cit might target ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammation capacities, which could be a therapeutic strategy against iron overload-induced thymus oxidative damage and immune dysfunction.",

Increased citrulline concentration was associated with decreased odds of LRTI (discovery cohort: aOR 0.83 [95% CI 0.70-0.99], p = 0.04; replication cohorts: aOR 0.58 [95% CI 0.28-1.22], p = 0.15).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Options to treat pulmonary hypertension (PH) in neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are few and largely ineffective. Improving the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) might be an efficacious treatment for BPD-PH. When administered orally, the NO-L-arginine precursor, L-citrulline, increases NO production in children and adults, however, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of oral L-citrulline have not been performed in infants and children. OBJECTIVES: This study characterized the PK of enterally administered L-citrulline in neonates at risk of developing BPD-PH to devise a model-informed dosing strategy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten premature neonates (≤ 28 weeks gestation) were administered a single dose of 150 mg/kg (powder form solubilized in sterile water) oral L-citrulline at 32 ± 1 weeks postmenstrual age. Due to the need to limit blood draws, time windows were used to maximize the sampling over the dosing interval by assigning neonates to one of two groups (ii) samples collected pre-dose and at 1- and 2.5-h post-dose, and (ii) pre-dose and 0.25- and 3-h post-dose. The L-arginine concentrations (µmol/L) and the L-citrulline (µmol/L) plasma concentration-time data were evaluated using non-compartmental analysis (Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.1). Optimal dosage strategies were derived using a simulation-based methodology. Simulated doses of 51.5 mg or 37.5 mg/kg given four times a day produced steady-state concentrations close to a target of 50 µmol/L. The volume of distribution (V/F) and clearance (CL/F) were 302.89 ml and 774.96 ml/h, respectively, with the drug exhibiting a half-life of 16 minutes. The AUC from the time of dosing to the time of last concentration was 1473.3 h*μmol/L, with Cmax and Tmax of 799 μmol/L and 1.55 h, respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first PK study in neonates presenting data that can be used to inform dosing strategies in future randomized controlled trials evaluating enteral L-citrulline as a potential treatment to reduce PH associated with BPD in premature neonates.

Yet, within the framework of exercises repeated at close time interval, the consequences of CM ingestion on mechanical performance are controversial and the bioenergetics side remains undocumented. The aim of this double-blind placebo-controlled study was to evaluate in vivo the effect of short-term (7 doses in 48 h) oral administration of CM upon gastrocnemius muscle function and bioenergetics using non-invasive multimodal NMR techniques in healthy rats. The experimental protocol consisted of two 6-min bouts of fatiguing exercise spaced by an 8-min recovery period. CM treatment did not affect the basal bioenergetics status and increased the half-fatigue time during the first exercise bout. With exercise repetition, it prevented PCr cost alteration and decreased both the glycolytic ATP production and the contractile ATP cost in working muscle, but these changes were not associated to any improvement in mechanical performance. In addition, CM did not influence the replenishment of high-energy phosphorylated compounds during the post-exercise recovery periods. Therefore, short-term CM administration enhances muscle bioenergetics throughout fatiguing bouts of exercise repeated at close time interval but this enhancement does not benefit to mechanical performance.",

The present study aimed to investigate if the organic compound citrulline has a protective against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated ALI and its potential mechanisms. ALI was induced in mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS (10 mg/kg). Citrulline (1 g/kg/day) was administrated i.p. 7 days prior to LPS injection. Mouse lung vascular endothelial cells (MLVECs) were divided into five groups: Control, LPS, LPS + Cit, LPS + N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and LPS + Cit + ML385. Lung injury was determined by morphology changes. Apoptosis and pyroptosis were detected using western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The present results indicated that citrulline can significantly attenuate ALI. Citrulline pretreatment decreased the expression of NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and decreased pyroptosis and apoptosis. Intervention with the total reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine attenuated NLRP3 inﬂammasome-associated pyroptosis and apoptosis in LPS-treated MLVECs. Citrulline pretreatment inhibited pyroptotic cell death and apoptosis induced by LPS. Citrulline decreased accumulation of intracellular ROS and activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. Furthermore, the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 reversed ROS generation, NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis and apoptosis suppressed by citrulline. In summary, the present data demonstrated that citrulline may confer protection against ALI via inhibition of ROS/NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis and apoptosis via the Nrf2 signaling pathway."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 25 patients with CLPD were examined. Examinations were conducted twice: before chemotherapy (CT) and after 3 courses of CT. Several biochemical markers in the blood were determined: the activity of catalase, the level of plasma citrulline, the concentration of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) and the concentration of substances that form a trimethine complex (TBARS) with 2-thiobarbituric acid. Patients were divided into groups: І (n=14) - patients who underwent only CT; ІІ (n=16) - patients who during CT received S-ademetionine, at a dose of 1000 mg/day intravenously for 10 days, then 500 mg twice a day for 20 days. ІІІ (n=20) -the control group of 20 practically healthy individuals. RESULTS: Results: Patients in both groups with CLPD had pre-existed mucosal injury that was characterized by 1.25 (p=0.0025) and 1.26 times (р=0.006) higher blood NANA concentration compared to the control group. The conduction of CT was associated with enterocytes dysfunction, which was characterized by 1,66 times (p=0,0002) lower plasma citrulline level in patients of group I compared to the initial examination. The infusion of S-ademetionine attenuated intestinal dysfunction that was associated with 1,23 times (p=0,0005) higher blood citrulline level after the CT as compared to group I. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The infusion of S-ademetionine as adjuvant treatment in patients with CLPD provided effective prophylaxis of intestinal injury that was associated with higher blood citrulline level after the conduction of CT.",

L-citrulline is a naturally occurring amino acid and has been suggested to influence heat shock responses. This study aimed to test whether L-citrulline supplementation would preserve mitochondrial integrity and attenuate heat-induced skeletal muscle injury, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. At 37°C, L-citrulline (2 mM) increased mitochondrial elongation in mouse C2C12 myoblasts, a process associated with a reduction in mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 levels. Mechanistic studies revealed that L-citrulline increased cellular nitric oxide (NO) levels, but not S-nitrosylation of Drp1. L-citrulline caused a decrease in phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser 616 and an increase in phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser 637, which resulted in a reduced mitochondrial localization of Drp1. L-NAME, a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor, abolished the increase in L-citrulline-induced NO levels and inhibited Drp1 phosphorylation changes and mitochondrial elongation, which indicates involvement of a NO-dependent pathway. Under 43°C heat stress conditions, L-citrulline prevented translocation of Drp1 to mitochondria, mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased membrane potential. Finally, L-citrulline pretreatment inhibited heat-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, caspase 3/7 activation, apoptotic cell death, and improved cell viability. NO inhibitor L-NAME abolished all the above protective effects of L-citrulline under heat stress. Our results suggest that L-citrulline prevents heat-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell injury through NO-mediated Drp1 inhibition in C2C12 myoblasts. L-citrulline may be an effective treatment for heat-related illnesses and other mitochondrial diseases."

      "abstract": "Earlier studies have suggested that severe intestinal mucositis (IM; citrulline < 10 µmol/L) is an independent risk factor for bloodstream infections (BSI) after cytotoxic therapy. Our aim was to grade IM in patients receiving commonly used chemotherapy and conditioning regimens, and characterize its relationship with BSI incidence. In a retrospective analysis of remission induction (RI) chemotherapy, or conditioning for autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; myeloablative conditioning [MAC] and non-myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning [NMA/RIC]), data were collected on central venous catheter (CVC) characteristics and BSI. The relationship between BSI occurrence and the degree of IM (determined by citrulline levels) and neutropenia was analyzed. In 626 CVC episodes, 268 (42.8%) laboratory-confirmed BSIs (LCBIs) occurred, classified as mucosal barrier injury (MBI)-LCBIs in 179 (28.6%) episodes, central line-associated BSIs in 113 (18.1%) episodes, and catheter-related BSIs in 55 (8.8%) episodes. In NMA/RIC, the mean duration of hypocitrullinemia was 0.77 days, with LCBI and MBI-LCBI occurring in 11.1% and 4.8% of episodes. In autologous HSCT, RI, and MAC allogeneic HSCT, LCBI and MBI-LCBI occurred frequently (40.0-63.8% and 22.8-53.2% of episodes, respectively) and the mean duration of hypocitrullinemia was significantly higher (9.2-13.8 days). There was a strong correlation between LCBI and the duration of hypocitrullinemia (Pearson's correlation coefficient R = 0.96), as opposed to the relationship between LCBI and the duration of neutropenia (R = 0.42). We conclude that citrulline can be used to grade BSI risk for commonly used intensive treatment regimens.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Cervical cancer is the deadliest gynecological malignancy. This study aims to examine the anticancer effects of L-citrulline on HeLa cell culture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HeLa cells were cultured in complete Eagle's minimum essential medium. HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated with L-citrulline. After incubation, MTT dye was added and incubated. Annexin- V technique was used to test the apoptosis. The activated caspases of HeLa cells by L-citrulline exposure were measured with the Caspase 3/7 technique. One-way variance analysis was conducted for statistical analysis by using GraphPad Prism 6.0 for Windows. RESULTS: L-citrulline showed its toxicity on HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner in application times of 24 and 48 hours. The IC50 dose of L-citrulline was 0.19 and 0.16 mg/mL at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. When HeLa cells were exposed to an IC50 dose of L-citrulline for 24 hours, the percentages of the dead, early apoptotic, and late apoptotic cells were detected to be 0.75%, 23.05%, and 12.75%, respectively. The differences in the wideness of the scratch area were observed at the initial stage and after 24 hours of applying L-citrulline. CONCLUSION: L-citrulline showed its toxicity on HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner. Based on Annexin and Caspase findings, it can be concluded that L-citrulline exerted a pro-apoptotic effect on HeLa cells in only a short exposure time. L-citrulline also showed a migration inhibitory effect. The findings of this study indicate L-citrulline to be worthy of investigation for its anticancer activities in vitro and in vivo, and as a candidate for cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays an important role in the ageing of the retina and in the pathogenesis of retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Hydrogen peroxide is a reactive oxygen species generated by the photo-excited lipofuscin that accumulates during ageing in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the age-related accumulation of lipofuscin is associated with ARMD. Iron also accumulates with age in the RPE that may contribute to ARMD as an important source of oxidative stress. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of L-Citrulline (CIT), a naturally occurring amino acid with known antioxidant properties, on oxidative stressed cultured RPE cells. Human RPE (ARPE-19) cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) or iron/ascorbate (I/A) for 4 h, either in the presence of CIT or after 24 h of pretreatment. Here, we show that supplementation with CIT protects ARPE-19 cells against H2 O2 and I/A. CIT improves cell metabolic activity, decreases ROS production, limits lipid peroxidation, reduces cell death and attenuates IL-8 secretion. Our study evidences that CIT is able to protect human RPE cells from oxidative damage and suggests potential protective effect for the treatment of retinal diseases associated with oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with a progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength as well as an increase in adiposity. These changes may have devastating impact on the quality of life of older adults. Mitochondrial dysfunctions have been implicated in aging-related and obesity-related deterioration of muscle function. Impairments in mitochondrial quality control processes (biogenesis, fusion, fission, and mitophagy) may underlie this accumulation of mitochondrial dysfunction. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) was shown to improve muscle and mitochondrial function in healthy young and old adults and to improve body composition in obese older adults. Recent studies also positioned citrulline (CIT) supplementation as a promising intervention to counter obesity-related and aging-related muscle dysfunction. In the present study, our objectives were to assess whether HIIT, alone or with CIT, improves muscle function, functional capacities, adipose tissue gene expression, and mitochondrial quality control processes in obese older adults. METHODS: Eighty-one-old and obese participants underwent a 12 week HIIT with or without CIT on an elliptical trainer [HIIT-CIT: 20 men/25 women, 67.2 ± 5.0 years; HIIT-placebo (PLA): 18 men/18 women, 68.1 ± 4.1 years]. Handgrip and quadriceps strength, lower limb muscle power, body composition, waist circumference, and functional capacities were assessed pre and post intervention. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed in a subset of participants to quantify markers of mitochondrial content (TOM20 and OXPHOS subunits), biogenesis (TFAM), fusion (MFN1&2, OPA1), fission (DRP1), and mitophagy (Parkin). Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies were also performed to assess the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. RESULTS: HIIT-PLA and HIIT-CIT displayed improvements in functional capacities (P < 0.05), total (mean ± SD: HIIT-PLA: +1.27 ± 3.19%, HIIT-CIT: +1.05 ± 2.91%, P < 0.05) and leg lean mass (HIIT-PLA: +1.62 ± 3.85%, HIIT-CIT: +1.28 ± 4.82%, P < 0.05), waist circumference (HIIT-PLA: -2.2 ± 2.9 cm, HIIT-CIT: -2.6 ± 2.5 cm, P < 0.05), and muscle power (HIIT-PLA: +15.81 ± 18.02%, HIIT-CIT: +14.62 ± 20.02%, P < 0.05). Only HIIT-CIT decreased fat mass (-1.04 ± 2.42%, P < 0.05) and increased handgrip and quadriceps strength (+4.28 ± 9.36% and +10.32 ± 14.38%, respectively, P < 0.05). Both groups increased markers of muscle mitochondrial content, mitochondrial fusion, and mitophagy (P < 0.05). Only HIIT-CIT decreased the expression of the lipid droplet-associated protein CIDEA (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High-intensity interval training is effective in improving functional capacities, lean mass, muscle power, and waist circumference in obese older adults. HIIT also increases markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial fusion, and mitophagy. Importantly, adding CIT to HIIT results in a greater increase in muscle strength and a significant decrease in fat mass. The present study therefore positions HIIT combined with CIT as an effective intervention to improve the health status of obese older adults.",

      "abstract": "The mechanism that mediates L-citrulline (L-Cit) hypothermia is poorly understood, and the involvement of nitric oxide signaling has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to determine L-Cit's influence on body temperature and to ascertain the central and peripheral mechanisms associated with this response. Chicks responded to intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of L-Cit with high and low body temperatures (P < 0.05) depending on the dose tested, for both the surface and rectal temperatures. Peripheral (i.p.) L-Cit injection did not affect body temperature responses. Nitric oxide (NO) concentration and NO synthase (NOS) were influenced with varying doses of L-Cit. Hypothalamic NO was increased at 4 µg L-Cit whereas, plasma iNOS was elevated at 2µg L-Cit treatment. However, i.p. L-Cit did not change the NO content, rather it induced higher (P < 0.05) plasma tNOS and iNOS activity, and further upregulated iNOS and nNOS gene expression in the hypothalamus. In addition, ICV L-Cit potentiated a pro- versus anti-inflammatory milieu with the induction of IL-8, IL-10, and TGFβ (P < 0.05), which may be related to the changes in body temperature. Following ICV L-Cit administration, it was observed that L-Cit caused dose variable changes in the ultrastructure of hypothalamic neurons. The lowest dose was associated with a higher number of dead or degenerating neurons, whereas the highest L-Cit dose had fewer neuronal numbers with larger sizes. Therefore, this study shows that central and peripheral L-Cit administration imposes changes in body temperature, nitric oxide production, and inflammatory responses, in a dose-dependent manner.",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made on 80 RA patients who received treatment in Wenjiang District People's Hospital of Chengdu from February 2017 to February 2020. According to their condition, they were identified as acute-stage patients (n=48) or remission-stage patients (n=32). In addition, 40 healthy individuals who received physical examination in our hospital during the same period were enrolled in a control group. Serum 25-(OH)-D3, IL-6, and CCP antibodies in all enrolled participants were quantified, and their levels were compared between RA patients at the acute stage and those at the remission stage before therapy, and also between patients with different efficacy after 3 months of therapy. The correlations of serum 25-(OH)-D3, IL-6, and CCP antibodies with disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS-28) were analyzed. A corresponding joint receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to analyze the diagnostic value of the combination of 25-(OH)-D3, IL-6, and CCP antibodies in the staging of RA patients, and logistic regression was used to establish an efficacy risk model. RESULTS: The highest serum 25-(OH)-D3 level was found in the control group, followed by the remission-stage patients and then acute-stage patients from high to low (all P<0.05), and the lowest levels of serum IL-6 and CCP antibodies were also found in the control group, followed by the remission-stage patients and then the acute-stage patients from low to high (all P<0.05). The Pearson's test revealed a negative correlation of 25-(OH)-D3 with DAS-28 and a positive correlation of IL-6 and CCP antibodies with DAS-28. According to ROC curve-based analysis, the area under the joint curve of 25-(OH)-D3, IL-6, and CCP antibodies was >0.9. After therapy, patients showed an increase in 25-(OH)-D3 and decreases in IL-6 and CCP antibodies (all P<0.05). The logistic model confirmed that the area under the ROC curve of RA affecting the efficacy on patients was >0.8. CONCLUSION: A combination of 25-(OH)-D3, IL-6, and CCP antibodies can be adopted as a diagnostic indicator in acute and remission stages of RA. A risk factor model of clinical efficacy in RA patients can help us effectively identify high-risk patients before therapy and take intervention measures early."

L-citrulline (L-CIT) supplementation has shown to reduce aortic SBP and pulse pressure (PP) responses to cold pressor test (CPT) induced sympathoactivation in young men. The aim of this study was to elucidate the efficacy of L-CIT supplementation to attenuate aortic hemodynamic responses to CPT in older adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen older adults were randomly assigned to placebo or L-CIT (6 g/day) for 14-days in a crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Brachial SBP and aortic SBP, PP, augmented pressure (AP), augmentation index standardized at 75 bpm (AIx@75), and pressure of the forward (Pf) and reflected (Pb) waves were evaluated at rest and during CPT pre- and post-intervention. Although no hemodynamic changes at rest, brachial SBP (Δ-12 ± 18 vs. Δ4 ± 14 mmHg; P = 0.008) and aortic SBP (Δ-10 ± 14 vs. Δ4 ± 12 mmHg; P = 0.005), PP (Δ-10 ± 12 vs. Δ4 ± 11 mmHg; P = 0.002), AP (Δ-4 ± 4 vs. Δ2 ± 7 mmHg; P = 0.004), AIx@75 (Δ-3.2 ± 7.2 vs. Δ2.2 ± 6.9%; P = 0.038), Pf (Δ-6 ± 10 vs. Δ3 ± 9 mmHg; P = 0.019), and Pb (Δ-4 ± 6 vs. Δ2 ± 6 mmHg; P = 0.008) responses to the CPT were significantly attenuated following L-CIT supplementation vs. placebo.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preeclampsia, characterized by hypertension, proteinuria and restriction of fetal growth, is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality. So far, there is no effective pharmacological therapy for preeclampsia. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of supplementation with l-citrulline in Dahl salt-sensitive rats, a model of superimposed preeclampsia. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Parental Dahl salt-sensitive rats were treated with l-citrulline (2.5 g·L-1 in drinking water) from the day of mating to the end of lactation period. Blood pressure was monitored throughout pregnancy and markers of preeclampsia were assessed. Endothelial function of the pregnant Dahl salt-sensitive rats was assessed by wire myograph. KEY RESULTS: In Dahl salt-sensitive rats, l-citrulline supplementation significantly reduced maternal blood pressure, proteinuria and levels of circulating soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1. l-Citrulline improved maternal endothelial function by augmenting the production of nitric oxide in the aorta and improving endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated vasorelaxation in resistance arteries. l-Citrulline supplementation improved placental insufficiency and fetal growth, which were associated with an enhancement of angiogenesis and reduction of fibrosis and senescence in the placentas. In addition, l-citrulline down-regulated genes involved in the TLR4 and NF-κB signalling pathways. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This study shows that l-citrulline supplementation reduced gestational hypertension and improved placentation and fetal growth in a rat model of superimposed preeclampsia. l-Citrulline supplementation may provide an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for preeclampsia that benefits both the mother and the fetus.",

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to examine longer-term and postprandial effects of L-citrulline supplementation and watermelon consumption on these markers for cardiovascular disease in adults. Summary estimates of weighted mean differences (WMDs) in vascular function and cardiometabolic risk markers with accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random or fixed-effect meta-analyses. Seventeen RCTs were included involving an L-citrulline intervention, of which six studied postprandial and twelve longer-term effects. Five studies investigated longer-term effects of watermelon consumption and five assessed effects during the postprandial phase. Longer-term L-citrulline supplementation improved brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) by 0.9 %-point (95 % CI: 0.7 to 1.1, P < 0.001). Longer-term watermelon consumption improved pulse wave velocity by 0.9 m/s (95% CI: 0.1 to 1.5, P < 0.001), while effects on FMD were not studied. No postprandial effects on vascular function markers were found. Postprandial glucose concentrations decreased by 0.6 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.4 to 0.7, P < 0.001) following watermelon consumption, but no other longer-term or postprandial effects were observed on cardiometabolic risk markers. To conclude, longer-term L-citrulline supplementation and watermelon consumption may improve vascular function, suggesting a potential mechanism by which increased L-citrulline intake beneficially affects cardiovascular health outcomes in adults. No effects on postprandial vascular function markers were found, while more research is needed to investigate effects of L-citrulline and watermelon on risk markers related to cardiometabolic health."

      "abstract": "Concomitant with developing pulmonary hypertension (PH), newborn piglets exposed to chronic hypoxia develop pulmonary vascular NO signaling impairments. PH is reduced and NO signaling is improved in chronically hypoxic piglets treated with the NO-arginine precursor, L-citrulline. Folic acid positively impacts NO signaling. We evaluated whether the effect on NO signaling and PH is greater using co-treatment with folic acid and L-citrulline than either alone. From day 3 to day 10 of hypoxia, piglets were treated solely with folic acid, solely with L-citrulline, or co-treated with both. Catheters were placed to measure in vivo hemodynamics. NO production was measured in vitro in dissected pulmonary arteries. Compared to normoxic piglets, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was elevated and NO production was reduced in untreated hypoxic piglets. Regardless of treatment strategy, PVR was less in all three treated groups of hypoxic piglets when compared to the untreated hypoxic group. In addition, for all three groups of treated hypoxic piglets, NO production was higher than the untreated group. Improvements in PVR and NO production did not differ between piglets co-treated with folic acid and L-citrulline and those treated solely with either. Thus, the impact on NO production and PVR was not augmented by combining folic acid and L-citrulline treatments. Nonetheless, treatment with folic acid, either singly or when combined with L-citrulline, increases NO production and inhibits PH in chronically hypoxic newborn piglets. Folic acid merits consideration as a therapy for PH in human infants with chronic heart and lung conditions that are associated with chronic hypoxia.",

Dietary supplementation of arginine (Arg) and citrulline (Cit) might increase the performance of broilers raised under warm temperature due to vasodilation effects. This study investigated the effects of L-Arg or L-Cit supplementation in broilers fed a reduced protein wheat-based diet deficient in Arg under thermoneutral (NT) and cyclic warm temperature (WT). Ross 308 cockerels (n = 720) were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatments with 12 replicates of 15 birds per pen from d 7 to 21. The 4 treatments were: normal protein (NP), i.e., 22.3% and 20.9% crude protein in grower and finisher, respectively; reduced protein (RP), i.e., 2.5% lower protein and deficient in Arg; and RP supplemented with 0.28% Arg (RP-Arg) or 0.28% Cit (RP-Cit). A factorial arrangement of treatments was applied during the finisher phase (21 to 35 d). Factors were: diet (4 diets above); and temperature, NT (24 °C) or cyclic WT (33 ± 1 °C for 6 h per day) with 6 replicate pens per treatment. During 7 to 35 d and 21 to 35 d, the birds fed the RP diet had lower body weight gain (BWG) and higher FCR compared to the NP diet (P < 0.01). The addition of Arg or Cit to RP decreased FCR compared to RP (P < 0.01). During 21 to 35 d, the birds exposed to WT had lower feed intake (FI), lower BWG (P < 0.001) but similar FCR (P > 0.05) compared to birds exposed to NT. Diet by temperature interactions were not observed for performance parameters during the period of WT (P > 0.05). On d 35, the RP-fed birds had a lower yield of thigh and drumstick, higher fat pad, lower femur ash, and breaking strength but similar serum uric acid level and higher nitrogen digestibility on d 21 compared to those offered NP (P < 0.05). Supplementation of Arg or Cit to RP resulted in increased femur ash on d 35 (P < 0.05). Thus, feeding the NP diets is necessary to maintain growth performance in broilers regardless of the temperature conditions."

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases that causes worldwide suffering. L. helveticus is a probiotic that can enhance intestinal barrier function via alleviation of excessive inflammatory response. Citrulline, a functional amino acid, has been reported to stimulate muscle synthesis and to function with a prebiotic-like action with certain Lactobacillus strains. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential synergistic effect of combining L. helveticus and citrulline on protection against damage induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in a mouse model. 6-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed with DSS water and randomly divided for administering with different milk treatments: 1) plain milk (control or DSS control), 2) 1% (w/v) citrulline enriched milk (Cit_milk), 3) milk fermented with L. helveticus (LHFM) and 4) DSS+milk fermented with L. helveticus with 1% (w/v) citrulline (Cit_LHFM). The treatment effects on the survival and macroscopic and microscopic signs were examined. All treatments presented different degrees of protective effects on attenuating the damages induced by DSS. All treatments reduced the body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), histological scores, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ) and production (IL-4) (all P <0.05) and the tight junction (TJ) protein (zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1) expression. LHFM and Cit_LHFM improved survival rate (both at P<0.05). Particularly, Cit_LHFM showed greater effects on protecting the damages induced by DSS, especially in ameliorating colonic permeability, TJ protein (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1) expression and distribution as well as in reducing IL-4 and IL-17 expression (all P <0.05). Our findings suggested that the combination of and citrulline had significant synergistic effect on protecting against injury from DSS-induced colitis. Therefore, citrulline enriched L. helveticus fermented milk is suggested to be a potential therapy for treating IBD.",

In this context, we have tested citrulline supplementation in a group of 44 participants aged from 60-73 years that followed a physical activity program adapted to their age and capacities. Volunteers were divided in two groups: placebo (n = 22) and citrullline supplemented (n = 22). Different physical tests and blood extractions were performed at the beginning and at the end of intervention (six weeks). Strength and endurance showed a tendency to increase in the citrulline supplemented group, with no significant differences respect to placebo. However, walking speed in the citrulline supplemented group improved significantly compared to placebo. Markers of muscle damage as well as circulating levels of testosterone, cortisol and vitamin D showed no significant changes, but a tendency to improve at the end of intervention in the supplemented group compared to placebo. Additional studies are necessary to confirm the effect of citrulline supplementation in sarcopenia delay.",

Obesity is commonly associated with cardiometabolic risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hypertension that contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, precedes vascular abnormalities including atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Thus, early detection and treatment of cardiometabolic risk factors are necessary to prevent deleterious vascular consequences of obesity at an early age. Non-pharmacological interventions including L-Citrulline (L-Cit) supplementation and aerobic training stimulate endothelial NO mediated vasodilation, leading to improvements in organ perfusion, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, atherosclerosis and metabolic health (glucose control and lipid profile). Few studies suggest that the combination of L-Cit supplementation and exercise training can be an effective strategy to counteract the adverse effects of obesity on vascular function in older adults. Therefore, this review examined the efficacy of L-Cit supplementation and aerobic training interventions on vascular and metabolic parameters in obese individuals.",

Therefore, developing a new treatment method and elucidating its mechanism is necessary. L-citrulline (L-Cit) is a free amino acid found mainly in watermelon. No reports regarding its effects on the improvement of hepatic steatosis and fibrogenesis are currently available. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect and the mechanism of L-Cit on inhibition of body weight gain and hepatic fat accumulation in high-fat and high-cholesterol fed SHRSP5/Dmcr rats. METHODS: L-Cit or water (controls) was administered to six-week-old male SHRSP5/Dmcr rats by gavage for nine weeks. We recorded the level of body weight and food intake while performing the administration and sacrificed rats. After that, the blood and lipid metabolism-related organs and tissues were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: L-Cit treatment reduced body weight gain and hepatic TC and TG levels, and serum levels of AST and ALT. L-Cit enhanced AMPK, LKB1, PKA, and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) protein phosphorylation levels in the epididymal fat. L-Cit treatment improved steatosis as revealed by HE staining of liver tissues and enhanced AMPK and LKB1 phosphorylation levels. Moreover, activation of Sirt1 was higher, while the liver fatty acid synthase (FAS) level was lower. Azan staining of liver sections revealed a reduction in fibrogenesis following L-Cit treatment. Further, the liver levels of TGF-β, Smad2/3, and α-SMA, fibrogenesis-related proteins and genes, were lower in the L-Cit-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: From the results of analysis of the epididymal fat and the liver, L-Cit inhibits body weight gain and hepatic fat accumulation by activating lipid metabolism and promoting fatty acid β-oxidation in SHRSP5/Dmcr rats."

In spite of a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological basis of mitochondrial disorders, treatment options remain limited. Over the past two decades, there is growing evidence that patients with mitochondrial disorders have nitric oxide (NO) deficiency due to the limited availability of NO substrates, arginine and citrulline; decreased activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS); and NO sequestration. Studies evaluating the use of arginine in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) presenting with stroke-like episodes showed symptomatic improvement after acute administration as well as a reduction in the frequency and severity of stroke-like episodes following chronic use. Citrulline, another NO precursor, was shown through stable isotope studies to result in a greater increase in NO synthesis. Recent studies showed a positive response of arginine and citrulline in other mitochondrial disorders besides MELAS. Randomized-controlled studies with a larger number of patients are warranted to better understand the role of NO deficiency in mitochondrial disorders and the efficacy of NO precursors as treatment modalities in these disorders."

The identification of GI mucosal damage at an early stage with high sensitivity and specificity across preclinical species and humans remains difficult. To date, in preclinical studies, no qualified mechanistic, diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers exist for GI mucosal toxicity. L-citrulline is one of the most promising biomarker candidates used in clinical settings to quantify enterocyte integrity in various small intestinal diseases. L-citrulline is an intermediate metabolic amino acid produced mainly by functional enterocytes of the small intestine, whereby enterocyte loss will cause a drop in circulating L-citrulline. METHODS: In several repeat-dose toxicity studies, plasma L-citrulline has been evaluated as a potential safety biomarker for intestinal toxicity in beagle dogs and Wistar (Han) rats treated with different oncological drug candidates in drug development. Clinical observations and body weight determinations were performed during the pretreatment, treatment and treatment-free recovery period as well as toxicokinetic, gross and histopathology examinations. The quantitative determination of plasma L-citrulline levels during the pretreatment (only dogs), treatment and treatment-free recovery period were performed using an HPLC MS/MS assay. In cynomolgus monkeys, the first investigations on baseline L-citrulline levels were performed. RESULTS: In dogs, a dose- and exposure-dependent decrease of up to 50% in plasma L-citrulline was seen without histopathological alterations. However, a decrease of more than 50% in comparison to the individual animal pretreatment value of L-citrulline correlated very well with histopathological findings (intestinal crypt necrosis, villus atrophy, enterocyte loss) and clinical signs (bloody faeces and diarrhoea). During a treatment-free recovery period, a trend of increasing levels was observed in dogs. In rats, absolute L-citrulline plasma levels of treated animals decreased compared to the values of the concurrent control group. This decrease also correlated with the histopathological findings in the small intestine (single cell necrosis and mucosa atrophy). Because of a large physiological variation in L-citrulline plasma levels in dogs and rats, a clear cut-off value for absolute L-citrulline levels predictive of intestinal mucosal toxicity was difficult to establish. However, a > 50% decrease in L-citrulline plasma levels during the treatment period strongly correlated with histopathological findings. DISCUSSION: Based on the performed analysis, a longitudinal investigation of L-citrulline plasma levels for individual animals in the control and treatment groups is essential and pretreatment values of L-citrulline levels in rodents would be highly informative. Overall, further cross-species comparison (Cynomolgus monkey, mouse) and implementation in clinical trials as exploratory biomarker is essential to foster the hypothesis and to understand completely the clinical relevance of L-citrulline as a small intestine biomarker.",

METHODS: A total of 110 critically ill patients with acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) admitted to ICU were enrolled. The AGI grade was determined by the AGI classification proposed by ESICM. There were 67 patients in gastrointestinal dysfunction (GID) group (AGI grade II), 43 patients in GIF group (AGI grade III-IV), and 41 healthy adults in healthy control (HC) group. APACHE II and SOFA score were used to evaluate the disease severity. Peripheral blood samples of patients were collected within 24 hours of admission to the ICU (prior-treatment) and after the conventional medication therapy for 7 consecutive days (post-treatment). Citrulline serum level was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method, and D-lactate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serum levels were measured by ELISA. Pearson correlation, logistic regression, and ROC curve analysis were used. RESULTS: Patients with GID or GIF had lower serum level of citrulline, while higher levels of D-lactate and LPS than HC. Compared with GID patients, serum level of citrulline was reduced, while D-lactate and LPS were elevated in GIF patients. Correlation analysis displayed that serum levels of citrulline, D-lactate, and LPS were associated with the APACHE II and SOFA score in patients with GID or GIF. Logistics regression analysis showed that citrulline and D-lactate were risk for both GID and GIF. ROC curve analysis exhibited that combination of citrulline and D-lactate had relatively high value to distinguish GID from HC, GIF from GID, and GIF from HC. CONCLUSION: Serum citrulline and D-lactate were associated with severity of GIF, combination of citrulline and D-lactate improved the diagnostic efficacy to identify GIF in critically ill patients."

      "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a spontaneously occurring pregnancy complication diagnosed by new-onset hypertension and end-organ dysfunction with or without proteinuria. This pregnancy-specific syndrome contributes to maternal morbidity and mortality and can have detrimental effects on fetal outcomes. Preeclampsia is also linked to increased risk of maternal cardiovascular disease throughout life. Despite intense investigation of this disorder, few treatment options are available. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of maternal l-citrulline supplementation on pregnancy-specific vascular dysfunction in the male C57BL/6J × female C57BL/6J C1q-/- preeclampsia-like mouse model. l-Citrulline is a nonessential amino acid that is converted to l-arginine to promote smooth muscle and blood vessel relaxation and improve nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vascular function. To model a preeclampsia-like pregnancy, female C57BL/6J mice were mated to C1q-/- male mice, and a subset of dams was supplemented with l-citrulline throughout pregnancy. Blood pressure, systemic vascular glycocalyx, and ex vivo vascular function were investigated in late pregnancy, and postpartum at 6 and 10 mo of age. Main findings show that l-citrulline reduced blood pressure, increased vascular glycocalyx volume, and rescued ex-vivo vascular function at gestation day 17.5 in this preeclampsia-like model. The vascular benefit of l-citrulline also extended postpartum, with improved vascular function and glycocalyx measures at 6 and 10 mo of age. l-Citrulline-mediated vascular improvements appear, in part, attributable to NO pathway signaling. Taken together, l-citrulline supplementation during pregnancy appears to have beneficial effects on maternal vascular health, which may have translational implications for improved maternal cardiovascular health.",

      "abstract": "A study was conducted with Hy-Line Brown laying hens to examine the effects of reduced protein diet, deficiency of arginine (Arg), and addition of crystalline Arg, citrulline (Cit) and guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) as substitutes for Arg. Hen performance, egg quality, serum uric acid, liver and reproductive organ weights, and energy and protein digestibility were measured using a completely randomized design with 5 treatments. Treatments were a standard diet (17% protein diet; SP), a reduced diet (13% protein diet deficient in Arg; RP) and RP with added Arg (0.35%, RP-Arg), GAA (0.46% equivalent to 0.35% Arg, RP-GAA) or Cit (0.35%, RP-Cit) to the level of SP. It was hypothesized that performance would decrease with Arg deficient RP diet and the addition of GAA or Cit in RP would allow birds to perform similar or greater than Arg-added RP treatment. The experiment was conducted from 20 to 39 wk of age but the treatment effect was seen only after 29 wk of age. The birds offered RP had reduced egg and albumin weights (P < 0.01), lower yolk color score (P < 0.01), lower protein intake and excretion (P < 0.01) than those offered SP. When Arg or Cit were added to RP to make them equivalent to SP, feed intake (FI) and egg production were not different than those of RP (P > 0.05). The birds offered RP-GAA decreased FI and egg production (P < 0.01) compared to those offered RP. The addition of Arg, Cit or GAA to the RP had no effect on egg quality parameters, protein and energy digestibilities (P > 0.05). However, birds offered the RP-Cit diet tended to have higher Haugh unit (P = 0.095) and lower shell breaking strength (P = 0.088) compared to all other treatments while those offered RP-GAA had higher energy digestibility (P < 0.05) than all other groups but RP. The limited performance response of hens fed RP with added Arg, GAA, or Cit may be due to deficiency of some other nutrients in RP such as phenylalanine, potassium or non-essential amino acids and other components of soybean meal in the diet."

      "abstract": "There are marked decreases in plasma concentrations of cortisol and arginine (an essential amino acid for neonates) as well as intestinal citrulline synthesis in piglets during the first 14 days of life. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that increasing plasma cortisol concentrations by cortisol administration may prevent the decline in intestinal citrulline and arginine synthesis from proline, thereby possibly increasing plasma arginine concentration in suckling piglets and their growth. Seven-day-old pigs reared by sows received daily intramuscular injections of hydrocortisone 21-acetate (25 mg/kg) or vehicle solution (saline) (n = 10/group). At 14 days of age, piglets were used to prepare jejunal enterocytes. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in oxygenated Krebs buffer containing 5 mM glucose, 2 mM [U-14C]proline, and 2 mM glutamine. Cortisol treatment increased plasma cortisol concentration, mitochondrial proline oxidase and N-acetylglutamate synthase activities, cytosolic argininosuccinate lyase activity, and the intracellular concentrations of N-acetylglutamate and carbamoyl phosphate for citrulline and arginine synthesis. However, cortisol treatment induced the expression of intestinal arginase-II for arginine hydrolysis, resulting in no change in plasma arginine concentration. Administration of cortisol had no effect on milk consumption or the whole-body growth rate of piglets, but increased villus height in the jejunum and ileum. Collectively, these results suggest an important role for proline oxidase and N-acetylglutamate in regulating citrulline and arginine synthesis from proline in pig enterocytes. Because proline catabolism plays an important role in modulating protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and arginine production, our findings may have important implications for understanding the role of proline oxidase in the growth and health of the mammalian small intestine.",

Dietary citrulline supplementation improves nutritional status in situations such as short bowel syndrome and aging, and is of potential interest in oncology. However, a mandatory prerequisite is to test this amino acid for interaction with tumor growth and chemotherapy response. Dietary citrulline (Cit; 2%), or an isonitrogenous mix of non-essential amino acids (control), was given to Ward colon tumor-bearing rats the day before chemotherapy initiation. Chemotherapy included 2 cycles, one week apart, each consisting of one injection of CPT-11 (50 mg/kg) and of 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/kg) the day after. Body weight, food intake and tumor volume were measured daily. The day after the last injection, rats were killed, muscles (EDL, gastrocnemius), intestinal mucosa, tumor, spleen and liver were weighed. Muscle and intestinal mucosa protein content were measured. Phosphorylated 4E-BP1 was measured in muscle and tumor as a surrogate for biosynthetic activation. FRAPS (Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma) and thiols in plasma, muscle and tumor were evaluated and plasma amino acids and haptoglobin were measured. Numerous parameters did not differ by diet overall: a) response of tumor mass to treatment, b) tumor antioxidants and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 levels, c) relative body weight and relative food intake, d) weight of EDL, gastrocnemius, intestinal mucosa, spleen and liver and e) plasma haptoglobin concentrations. Moreover, plasma citrulline concentration was not correlated to relative body weight, only cumulated food intake and plasma haptoglobin concentrations were correlated to relative body weight. Citrulline does not alter the tumor response to CPT-11/5FU based therapy but, has no effect on nutritional status, which could be due to the anorexia and the low amount of citrulline and protein ingested.",

      "abstract": "The objective of the study was to examine how l-citrulline supplementation to ewes during mid-gestation influences placental activity, placental blood flow, lamb body weight, and carcass characteristics. Two studies were completed. A pharmacokinetic study to compare circulating plasma amino acid concentrations after a single intravenous injection of 155 µmol/kg BW l-citrulline or after an isonitrogenous amount of l-alanine (control; 465 µmol/kg BW). Increases (P < 0.05) in circulating citrulline concentrations were detected for 8 h after l-citrulline injection versus the control. Similarly, increases (P < 0.05) in circulating arginine concentrations were detected for 24 h after l-citrulline treatment. The second study used 12 ewes with twin pregnancies. Daily intravenous injections of either l-citrulline or l-alanine were administered for 39 d from d 42-45 to 81-84 of gestation. Ewes were limit-fed at 85% daily energy requirements during the injection period. A decrease (P < 0.0001) in body weight was observed in both treatment groups during this period. No treatment differences were observed in circulating pregnancy-specific protein B concentrations or placental blood flow during the treatment and post-treatment gestational period. No treatment differences were observed in lamb survival nor in lamb birth, weaning and slaughter weights. Treatment did not influence lamb carcass composition or organ weights. However, there was a tendency (P = 0.10) for an increase in antral follicle numbers in ovaries from ewe lambs derived from ewes treated with l-citrulline. In summary, a daily l-citrulline injection increased both circulating citrulline and arginine concentrations in ewes, but daily l-citrulline injections during mid-gestation did not produce any detectable changes in placental activity and blood flow, neonatal and postnatal lamb development, and lamb carcass composition at slaughter. In conclusion, no benefits in placental function and lamb development were observed after providing l-citrulline during mid-gestation in ewes exposed to a mild energy restriction, but there was an indication that follicle numbers in ewe lambs were positively influenced by l-citrulline treatment during fetal development."

METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, 54 patients with T2D referred to specialized clinics of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences were assigned to L-CIT group (receiving orally one 3 g sachet of L-CIT daily before breakfast) or placebo group (receiving orally one 3 g sachet of microcrystalline cellulose daily before breakfast) for eight weeks. Serum levels of fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), CIT, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) were determined. The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B) index were estimated at the baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between the studied parameters at the baseline. L-CIT supplementation significantly reduced not only serum concentrations of fasting blood glucose but also HbA1c, serum IL-6 and TLR-4 levels in the L-CIT group (p < 0.05). Additionally, at the end of the study serum levels of CIT increased significantly in L-CIT group compared to the baseline and placebo group. Fasting blood glucose concentrations and HbA1c significantly decreased after the intervention compared to the placebo. There was no significant difference in serum IL-6, TLR-4, MCP-1 levels, as well as QUICKI and HOMA-B index between the two groups, even after adjusting for baseline variables and confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that, although L-CIT supplementation significantly reduced fasting blood glucose concentrations, HbA1c and increased serum levels of CIT. It seems it could not significantly improve insulin sensitivity and meta-inflammation biomarkers. Additional studies with longer duration and different doses of L-CIT are required. Trial registration The protocol of this clinical trial is registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (registration no: IRCT20100209003320N16 at www.irct.ir )."

L-arginine can induce arginase, which, in turn, may diminish nitric oxide production. Our major purpose was to determine if L-citrulline increases arginase activity in hypoxic piglet pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and if so, concomitantly impacts the ability to increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase re-coupling and nitric oxide production. Piglet pulmonary arterial endothelial cells were cultured in hypoxic conditions with L-citrulline (0-3 mM) and/or the arginase inhibitor S-(2-boronoethyl)-L-cysteine. We measured arginase activity and nitric oxide production. We assessed endothelial nitric oxide synthase coupling by measuring endothelial nitric oxide synthase dimers and monomers. L-citrulline concentrations ≥0.5 mM increased arginase activity in hypoxic pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. L-citrulline concentrations ≥0.1 mM increased nitric oxide production and concentrations ≥0.5 mM elevated endothelial nitric oxide synthase dimer-to-monomer ratios. Co-treatment with L-citrulline and S-(2-boronoethyl)-L-cysteine elevated endothelial nitric oxide synthase dimer-to-monomer ratios more than sole treatment. Despite inducing arginase, L-citrulline increased nitric oxide production and endothelial nitric oxide synthase coupling in hypoxic piglet pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. However, these dose-dependent findings raise the possibility that there could be L-citrulline concentrations that elevate arginase to levels that negate improvements in endothelial nitric oxide synthase dysfunction. Moreover, our findings suggest that combining an arginase inhibitor with L-citrulline merits evaluation as a treatment for chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension."

METHODS: Three-month citrulline or water supplementation was blindly given to male and female wild-type and 3 × Tg mice with AD trained and tested in the Morris water maze. Cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue were collected. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography was used for arginine determinations and the Griess method for NO. RESULTS: Eight-month-old male 3 × Tg mice with AD supplemented with citrulline performed significantly better in the Morris water maze task. Arginine levels increased in the cerebrospinal fluid although no changes were seen in brain tissue and only a tendency of increase of NO was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Citrulline oral administration is a viable treatment for memory improvement in the early stages of AD, pointing to NO as a viable, efficient target for memory dysfunction in AD.",

The identification of GI mucosal damage at an early stage with high sensitivity and specificity across preclinical species and humans remains difficult. To date, in preclinical studies, no qualified mechanistic, diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers exist for GI mucosal toxicity. l-citrulline is one of the most promising biomarker candidates used in clinical settings to quantify enterocyte integrity in various small intestinal diseases. l-citrulline is an intermediate metabolic amino acid produced mainly by functional enterocytes of the small intestine, whereby enterocyte loss will cause a drop in circulating l-citrulline. METHODS: In several repeat-dose toxicity studies, plasma l-citrulline has been evaluated as a potential safety biomarker for intestinal toxicity in beagle dogs and Wistar (Han) rats treated with different oncological drug candidates in drug development. Clinical observations and body weight determinations were performed during the pretreatment, treatment and treatment-free recovery period as well as toxicokinetic, gross and histopathology examinations. The quantitative determination of plasma l-citrulline levels during the pretreatment (only dogs), treatment and treatment-free recovery period were performed using an HPLC MS/MS assay. In cynomolgus monkeys, the first investigations on baseline l-citrulline levels were performed. RESULTS: In dogs, a dose- and exposure-dependent decrease of up to 50% in plasma l-citrulline was seen without histopathological alterations. However, a decrease of more than 50% in comparison to the individual animal pretreatment value of l-citrulline correlated very well with histopathological findings (intestinal crypt necrosis, villus atrophy, enterocyte loss) and clinical signs (bloody faeces and diarrhoea). During a treatment-free recovery period, a trend of increasing levels was observed in dogs. In rats, absolute l-citrulline plasma levels of treated animals decreased compared to the values of the concurrent control group. This decrease also correlated with the histopathological findings in the small intestine (single cell necrosis and mucosa atrophy). Because of a large physiological variation in l-citrulline plasma levels in dogs and rats, a clear cut-off value for absolute l-citrulline levels predictive of intestinal mucosal toxicity was difficult to establish. However, a > 50% decrease in l-citrulline plasma levels during the treatment period strongly correlated with histopathological findings. DISCUSSION: Based on the performed analysis, a longitudinal investigation of l-citrulline plasma levels for individual animals in the control and treatment groups is essential and pretreatment values of l-citrulline levels in rodents would be highly informative. Overall, further cross-species comparison (Cynomolgus monkey, mouse) and implementation in clinical trials as exploratory biomarker is essential to foster the hypothesis and to understand completely the clinical relevance of l-citrulline as a small intestine biomarker.",

      "abstract": "Radiation combined injury (RCI, radiation exposure coupled with other forms of injury, such as burn, wound, hemorrhage, blast, trauma and/or sepsis) comprises approximately 65% of injuries from a nuclear explosion, and greatly increases the risk of morbidity and mortality when compared to that of radiation injury alone. To date, no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved countermeasures are available for RCI. Currently, three leukocyte growth factors (Neupogen®, Neulasta® and Leukine®) have been approved by the FDA for mitigating the hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome. However these granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) products have failed to increase 30-day survival of mice after RCI, suggesting a more complicated biological mechanism is in play for RCI than for radiation injury. In the current study, the mitigative efficacy of combination therapy using pegylated (PEG)-G-CSF (Neulasta) and -citrulline was evaluated in an RCI mouse model. L-citrulline is a neutral alpha-amino acid shown to improve vascular endothelial function in cardiovascular diseases. Three doses of PEG-G-CSF at 1 mg/kg, subcutaneously administered on days 1, 8 and 15 postirradiation, were supplemented with oral -citrulline (1 g/kg), once daily from day 1 to day 21 postirradiation. The combination treatment significantly improved the 30-day survival of mice after RCI from 15% (vehicle-treated) to 42%, and extended the median survival time by 4 days, as compared to vehicle controls. In addition, the combination therapy significantly increased body weight and bone marrow stem and progenitor cell clonogenicity in RCI mice, and accelerated recovery from RCI-induced intestinal injury, compared to animals treated with vehicle. Treatment with -citrulline alone also accelerated skin wound healing after RCI. In conclusion, these data indicate that the PEG-G-CSF and -citrulline combination therapy is a potentially effective countermeasure for mitigating RCI, likely by enhancing survival of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and accelerating recovery from the RCI-induced intestinal injury and skin wounds.",

      "abstract": "In our previous study, we found that the vasodilation of retinal arterioles induced by acetylcholine and BMS-191011, a large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channel opener, were diminished in diabetic rats. Currently, few agents ameliorate the impaired vasodilator responses of retinal blood vessels. Our recent finding that the intravenous infusion of L-citrulline dilated retinal arterioles, suggests that L-citrulline could be a potential therapeutic agent for circulatory disorders of the retina. In this study, we determined the effect of an oral L-citrulline treatment on impaired acetylcholine- and BMS-191011-induced vasodilation in the retinal arterioles of diabetic rats. To induce diabetes, rats were administered an intravenous dose of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) and a 5% D-glucose solution as drinking water. The L-citrulline (2 g/kg/day) and L-arginine (2 g/kg/day) treatments commenced either 15 days before or just after the streptozotocin injection and continued throughout the experimental period. A 29-day treatment with L-citrulline, but not L-arginine, significantly ameliorated the impaired acetylcholine- and BMS-191011-induced retinal vasodilation in diabetic rats without affecting their plasma glucose levels. The 2-week L-citrulline treatment tended to ameliorate the dysfunction of the acetylcholine-induced retinal vasodilation in diabetic rats. In conclusion, these results showed that the retinal blood vessel dysfunction induced by diabetes mellitus could be prevented by the long-term administration of L-citrulline and suggest that the latter could play a potentially prophylactic role in diabetic retinopathy."

All the above ligands bind selectively and preferentially to Cys-145 active site and also to other amino acids surrounding to it in the main protease. Of which arginine forms less number of weaker bonds compared to the other ligands, it by itself is a precursor for the formation of citrulline analogues with in the cell. Major advantage of using the above ligands is that in addition to its preferential binding, they have the ability to increase the immunity by assisting NO generation.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Specific modifications to carriers to achieve targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics into malignant tissues are a critical point for efficient diagnosis and therapy. In this case, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was conjugated with cetuximab-valine-citrulline (vc)-doxorubicin (DOX) to target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and enable the release of drug in EGFR-overexpressed tumor cells. METHODS: Maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzylcarbonyl-p-nitrophenol (MC-Val-Cit-PAB-PNP) and DOX were used to synthesize MC-Val-Cit-PAB-DOX, which was further linked with cetuximab to prepare antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Then, the ADCs were adsorbed to the surface of the BSA nanoparticles (NPs), which were prepared by a desolvation method to obtain cetuximab-vc-DOX-BSA-NPs. The cetuximab-vc-DOX conjugates adsorbed on the surface of the BSA nanoparticles were determined and optimized by size exclusion chromatography. An in vitro cytotoxicity study was conducted using a colon carcinoma cell line with different EGFR-expression levels to test the selectivity of cetuximab-vc-DOX-NPs. RESULTS: The vc-DOX and cetuximab-vc-DOX conjugates were both synthesized successfully and their structural characteristics confirmed by 1H-NMR and SDS-PAGE. The MTT assay showed stronger cytotoxicity of cetuximab-vc-DOX-NPs versus control IgG-vc-DOX-NPs in EGFR-overexpressing RKO cells. Cellular binding and intracellular accumulation determined by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed the strong binding ability of cetuximab-vc-DOX-NPs to RKO cells. The in vivo imaging study demonstrated that cetuximab-vc-DOX-NPs exhibited higher fluorescent intensity in tumor tissues than non-decorated nanoparticles (IgG-vc-DOX-NPs). In vivo tumor inhibition and survival tests showed that cetuximab-vc-DOX-NPs revealed higher tumor inhibition efficacy and lower systemic toxicity than control IgG-vc-DOX- NPs. CONCLUSION: The obtained results emphasize that cetuximab-vc-DOX-NPs, with good tumor-targeting ability and low systemic toxicity, are a promising targeting system for drug delivery.",

The non-proteogenic amino acid l-citrulline (L-Cit) has been shown to protect mice from the development of NAFLD. Here, we aimed to further assess if L-Cit also attenuates the progression of a pre-existing diet-induced NAFLD and to determine molecular mechanisms involved. Female C57BL/6J mice were either fed a liquid fat-, fructose- and cholesterol-rich diet (FFC) or control diet (C) for 8 weeks to induce early stages of NASH followed by 5 more weeks with either FFC-feeding +/- 2.5 g L-Cit/kg bw or C-feeding. In addition, female C57BL/6J mice were either pair-fed a FFC +/- 2.5 g L-Cit/kg bw +/- 0.01 g/kg bw i.p. N(ω)-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine (NOHA) or C diet for 8 weeks. The protective effects of supplementing L-Cit on the progression of a pre-existing NAFLD were associated with an attenuation of 1) the increased translocation of bacterial endotoxin and 2) the loss of tight junction proteins as well as 3) arginase activity in small intestinal tissue, while no marked changes in intestinal microbiota composition were prevalent in small intestine. Treatment of mice with the arginase inhibitor NOHA abolished the protective effects of L-Cit on diet-induced NAFLD. Our results suggest that the protective effects of L-Cit on the development and progression of NAFLD are related to alterations of intestinal arginase activity and intestinal permeability.",

      "abstract": "Increased blood pressure (BP), vascular dysfunction and inflammation are involved in the etiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although several dietary components such as polyphenols and L-citrulline may help to control BP, their combined impact on ambulatory BP in individuals at risk of CVD remains unknown. The objective of this research was to investigate the short-term impact of supplementation with a combination of polyphenol extract and L-citrulline on ambulatory BP, endothelial function and inflammation. In a randomized double-blind parallel trial, 73 men and women with prehypertension were supplemented with a placebo (cellulose, n = 34, Plac) or 548 mg/day of polyphenols and 2 g/day of L-citrulline (n = 35, Suppl) for 6 weeks. The primary outcome of this study was the difference between groups in 24-h ambulatory diastolic BP (DBP) at week six. Secondary outcomes were a difference between groups at week six in ambulatory systolic BP (SBP), casual BP, serum lipids and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations and skin advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Potential interaction of treatment with sex was examined. Suppl had no impact on mean ambulatory SBP and DBP (p > 0.10 vs. placebo). Daytime and 24-h SBP were reduced with Suppl in women (p ≤ 0.01), but not in men (p ≥ 0.27). A non-significant reduction in AGEs was observed after Suppl compared to Plac among all participants (p = 0.07) and there was no difference in the concentrations of blood lipids (p > 0.20) or CRP (p = 0.36) between treatments at week six. Therefore, supplementation with polyphenol extract and L-citrulline for 6 weeks has no impact on ambulatory BP, blood lipids and CRP in adults with prehypertension. However, the polyphenol extract/L-citrulline supplement may reduce ambulatory SBP in women, but not in men. These preliminary results need further research efforts towards further documenting this sex-dependent BP response to supplementation with polyphenols and L-citrulline.",

Oral citrulline, a precursor to NO synthesis, is safe and efficacious for decreasing the risk of postoperative PH. Objective: OBJETIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate in pediatric patients the changes of plasma citrulline, arginine, homocysteine and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites and pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) pre-post cardiac surgery in order to describe our population status with regard to the risk of pulmonary hypertension and look for potential biomarkers for early detection and treatment. MAIN RESULTS/DISCUSSION: 16 Argentine pediatric patients with CHD undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized in two groups: (A) with and (B) without perioperative citrulline supplementation. We found that plasma citrulline median levels before surgery were lower in both groups respect to referential values, probably due to the poor nutritional status of our patients; only group A surpassed post-surgery the minimum recommended level to avoid PH. Furthermore, none of the patients in group A showed mean PAP higher than 20 mmHg, whereas in group B, 67% of the measurements were ≥ than the reference level. CONCLUSIONS: We reaffirm that citrulline supplementation it is effective in reducing postoperative pulmonary hypertension and biomarkers could evidence patient status as a translational medicine application.",

METHODS: In preterm infants with NEC (Bell's stage ≥2) we measured citrulline-P levels during the first 48 h after NEC onset. Categorizing the measurements into 0-8 h, 8-16 h, 16-24 h, 24-36 h, and 36-48 h, we determined the course of citrulline-P using linear regression analyses. Next, we analyzed whether citrulline-P levels measured at 0-24 h and 24-48 h differed between conservative and surgical treatment, survivors and nonsurvivors, and equal/below and above total group's median time to full enteral feeding (FEFt). RESULTS: We included 48 infants, median gestational age 28.3 [IQR:26.0-31.4] weeks, birth weight 1200 [IQR:905-1524] grams. Citrulline-P levels decreased the first 48 h (B per time interval: -1.40 μmol, 95% CI, -2.73 to -0.07, p = 0.04). Citrulline-P was not associated with treatment, nor with survival. Citrulline-P at 0-24 h, but not 24-48 h, was higher in infants with FEFt ≤20 days than in infants with FEFt >20 days (20.7 [IQR:19.9-25.3] µmol/L (n = 13) vs. 11.1 [IQR:8.4-24.0] µmol/L (n = 11), p = 0.049), with a citrulline-P cut-off value of 12.3 μmol/L. CONCLUSION: Citrulline-P levels decreased the first 48 h after NEC onset, suggesting on-going intestinal injury. In survivors, measuring citrulline-P in the first 24 h after NEC onset may provide an indication for intestinal recovery rate.",

      "abstract": "Gestating ewes consuming ergot alkaloids, from endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue seed, suffer from intrauterine growth restriction and produce smaller lambs. Arginine (Arg) supplementation has been shown to increase birth weight and oral citrulline (Cit) administration is reported to increase arginine concentrations. Two experiments were conducted to: 1) evaluate if oral supplementation with Cit or water, to ewes consuming E+ fescue seed, increases lamb birth weight and 2) determine the effectiveness of Cit and citrulline:malate as an oral drench and elevating circulating levels of Cit to determine levels and dose frequency. In experiment 1, gestating Suffolk ewes (n = 10) were assigned to one of two treatments [oral drench of citrulline-malate 2:1 (CITM; 81 mg/kg/d of citrulline) or water (TOX)] to start on d 86 of gestation and continued until parturition. Ewes on CITM treatment had decreased (P < 0.05) plasma Arg and Cit concentrations during gestation. At birth, lambs from CITM ewes had reduced (P < 0.05) crude fat and total fat but did not differ (P > 0.05) in birth weight from lambs born to TOX ewes. In experiment 2, nonpregnant Suffolk ewes (n = 3) were assigned to either oral citrulline (CIT; 81 mg/kg/d), citrulline-malate 2:1 (CITM; 81 mg/kg/d of citrulline), or water (CON) drench in a Latin Square design for a treatment period of 4 d with a washout period of 3 d. On d 4, blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 18 h post drench. Oral drenching of CIT and CITM increased (P < 0.0001) Cit concentrations within 2 h and levels remained elevated for 6 h. Apparent half-life of elimination for CIT and CITM were 8.484 and 10.392 h, respectively. Our results show that lamb birth weight was not altered with a single oral drench of citrulline-malate; however, lamb body composition was altered. The level and frequency of citrulline dosing may need to be greater in order to observe consistent elevation of Cit/Arg concentrations to determine its effectiveness in mitigating fescue toxicosis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Systemic infections are a major cause of morbidity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, identification of patients at increased risk is still a challenge. Knowing that both neutropaenia and gastrointestinal toxicity are risk factors for bacteraemia, we aimed at comparing absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and plasma citrulline levels (indicating enterocyte loss) in children with ALL with and without bacteraemia during induction treatment. PROCEDURE: We prospectively included 61 children with ALL treated according to the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-2008 protocol. ANC and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on treatment days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Plasma citrulline was measured on days 1, 8, 15 and 29. Bacteraemia episodes during induction treatment were recorded retrospectively. RESULTS: Nineteen of sixty-one (31%) patients experienced bacteraemia occurring on median day 13 (range 5-20). Patients with bacteraemia during induction treatment had lower citrulline level on day 15 (P < .01) compared to patients without bacteraemia, indicating more severe enterocyte loss. Nevertheless, ANC was similar in the two patient groups on days 8 and 15. CRP was negatively correlated with same-day citrulline (P < .03 for all) and ANC (P < .04 for all). CONCLUSIONS: During chemotherapy-induced neutropaenia, plasma citrulline may help identify patients at increased risk of bacteraemia.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Sexuality is very important for men's health. Currently, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) remain the first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction, and no other oral drugs or drinks are approved and used clinically to treat male libido or orgasm dysfunction. In reference to a pharmaceutical dosage document, growing health consciousness is said to have boosted yearly sales of supplement drinks to more than 170 billion yen (1.58 billion US dollars) in Japan. We have created a supplement drink comprised of testofen, L-citrulline, resveratrol, and caffeine. We hypothesized that our supplement drink would be effective for men with sexual dysfunction, and especially libido dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, men with sexual dysfunction received a placebo drink for 14 days or our supplement drink (testofen, 600 mg/d; L-citrulline, 800 mg/d; resveratrol, 300 mg/d; and caffeine, 40 mg/d) for another 14 days separated by a 7-day washout period. Patients continued on-demand use of PDE5i. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score and adverse events were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty patients aged 30-7 years old were enrolled in and concluded the study with no adverse events experienced. The IIEF domains of desire frequency, erection frequency, erection firmness, erection confidence, intercourse satisfaction, ejaculation frequency, orgasm frequency, and overall satisfaction were significantly improved with our supplement drink. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that our supplement drink may not only be effective for erection but also for libido, orgasm, and ejaculation."
