      "abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis is a pathophysiological process characterized by the destruction of muscle cells and the release of intracellular contents into the systemic circulation, which can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and failure. Causes are classified mainly as traumatic and non-traumatic, with statin-induced rhabdomyolysis being widely recognized. Other causes are seldomly reported, one being red yeast rice (RYR) or its active ingredient, monacolin K. We present a life-threatening case of fulminant rhabdomyolysis with severe hyperkalemia, accompanied by ECG changes, tetraparesis, impending compartment syndrome, and liver injury requiring intensive care treatment. Prompt renal replacement therapy was commenced, initially for the treatment of hyperkalemia and subsequently for myoglobin adsorption using the CytoSorb membrane. High doses of corticosteroids were administered as the trigger factor was initially unknown. The condition gradually improved, and the patient regained full functionality. The diagnosis of toxic rhabdomyolysis was confirmed only after the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit. An over-the-counter supplement containing red yeast rice (RYR) was identified as the sole possible triggering factor, with symptoms occurring two days after beginning the self-treatment."

      "abstract": "Recently, several Japanese patients have developed interstitial nephritis or acute tubular injury/necrosis, both accompanied by Fanconi syndrome, after consuming a specific red yeast rice supplement. In most cases, the renal function did not fully recover even after discontinuation of supplements and glucocorticoid treatment. A 52-year-old woman developed interstitial nephritis and Fanconi syndrome after receiving supplements. A renal biopsy revealed mild lymphocytic infiltration. Her renal function recovered after discontinuing the supplement without glucocorticoids. The supplement was contaminated with puberulic acid, a known cause of tubular necrosis; however, the cause of interstitial nephritis remains uncertain. Biopsy findings guided the decision to avoid glucocorticoids."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A comparative 12-week dietary intervention of red yeast rice (RYR, Beni-koji, Kobayashi, Japan) and Cuban policosanol (PCO, Raydel®, Thornleigh, Australia) was assessed for dyslipidemia, antioxidant status, and vital organ functionality in hyperlipidemic zebrafish. METHODS: Hyperlipidemic zebrafish were supplemented with a high-cholesterol diet (HC, final 4%, w/w) infused with either a powdered RYR tablet (final 1.0%, w/w), a PCO tablet (final 1.0%, w/w), or a combination of 0.5% (w/w) each of RYR and PCO powder for 12 weeks. Subsequently, blood and organs were collected and processed for biochemical and histological examination. RESULTS: RYR and PCO consumption showed a substantial effect against HC-induced hyperlipidemia by reducing the total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Exclusively, PCO supplementation revealed a significant elevation in the HC-diminished high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). In addition, PCO supplementation showed a significant elevation in plasma ferric ion-reducing ability (FRA) and sulfhydryl content, as well as alleviating the blood glucose level of hyperlipidemic zebrafish. The most noteworthy impact, with a significant two-fold (p < 0.001) augmentation of HC-diminished plasma paraoxonase (PON) activity, was observed in response to PCO. In contrast, the RYR supplementation failed to establish curative effects against HC-disturbed plasma antioxidant variables and blood glucose levels. The histological outcome revealed a severe toxicological impact of the RYR on the liver, reflected by fatty liver changes and three-fold heightened IL-6 production compared to HC control. Contrastingly, PCO exhibited significant hepatoprotection and effectively neutralized the hepatic toxicity triggered by HC and RYR. Also, RYR showed kidney atrophy, intense ROS generation, apoptosis, and senescence. Conversely, the PCO supplementation protected the kidney from HC- and RYR-induced toxicity. Likewise, PCO supplementation notably alleviated histological alterations and oxidative stress in the brain, ovary, and testis of hyperlipidemic zebrafish. CONCLUSIONS: This comparative study establishes PCO's therapeutic effect against the challenges posed by HC, while RYR emerged with serious toxicological concerns towards the liver, kidney, and other organs of hyperlipidemic zebrafish."

      "abstract": "To date, the treatment strategy and long-term prognosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) after taking Benikoji CholesteHelp®, a red yeast rice supplement, remains unclear. We present three cases wherein renal dysfunction improved within a few months of supplement discontinuation, without immunosuppressive therapy. Case 1: A 59-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, treated with telmisartan (serum creatinine [sCr]: 0.65 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]: 71.3 mL/min/1.73 m2) and Benikoji CholesteHelp® for 7 months, developed Fanconi syndrome (FS) and severe renal impairment (sCr: 2.32 mg/dL; eGFR: 17.7 mL/min/1.73 m2). Renal biopsy and gallium-67 scintigraphy revealed no active drug-induced interstitial nephritis. Her condition improved significantly after supplement discontinuation. Her renal function gradually improved, with 3-month follow-up sCr and eGFR values of 0.96 mg/dL and 46.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively; however, these were still worse than the pre-onset values. Case 2: A 48-year-old man had mild renal dysfunction (sCr: 1.12 mg/dL; eGFR: 56.76 mL/min/1.73 m2) after taking Benikoji CholesteHelp® for approximately 2 years; this was reversed upon supplement discontinuation. Case 3: A 47-year-old man with FS and mild renal dysfunction (sCr: 1.09 mg/dL; eGFR: 58.5 mL/min/1.73 m2) after taking Benikoji CholesteHelp® for approximately 4 months, showed notable improvement in FS after supplement discontinuation; however, the mild renal dysfunction persisted. The primary intervention in all cases was immediate supplement discontinuation, leading to rapid improvement in renal function, without need for immunosuppressive therapy. These findings increase our understanding of renal impairment caused by red yeast rice, with improvement after withdrawal, sometimes after several months."

Electron microscopy revealed fluffy materials in the tubular lumen surrounded by necrotic tubular cell debris and intracellular contents. Discontinuation of the supplement and treatment with prednisolone improved kidney function and Fanconi syndrome. Longitudinal monitoring and surveys are required to detect and prevent the progression to chronic kidney disease in people who have consumed \"Beni Koji Choleste Help.\"",

Under the rising demand for natural bioactive molecules, we present a green ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) optimization study for MK in RYR. The development and validation of a fast, sensitive, selective, reproducible, and accurate ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) method coupled to diode array detection for LMK and AMK allowed us to evaluate the MK recovery in different extract media. Firstly, the ethanol comparability to acetonitrile was assessed (recovery of 80.7 ± 0.1% for ethanol and 85.5 ± 0.2% for acetonitrile). Then, water/ethanol mixtures, with decreasing percentages of organic solvent, were tested by modulating temperature and extraction times. Water extractions at 80 °C for 10 min produced MK yield > 85%. Thus, UAE conditions were optimized by a DOE study using a water-based formulation (mouthwash). The optimal total MK extraction yield (86.6 ± 0.4%) was found under the following conditions: 80 °C, 45 min, 5 mg mL-1 (RYR powder/solvent). Therefore, the new single-process green approach allowed the simultaneous direct extraction of MK and mouthwash enrichment (MK concentration = 130.0 ± 0.6 µg mL-1), which might be tested for the prevention and treatment of periodontitis or oral candidiasis."

A kidney biopsy revealed findings consistent with acute tubular necrosis and localized tubulointerstitial nephritis, with no specific vascular or glomerular lesions. The patient's medical history revealed that prior to both AKI episodes, the patient had been taking \"Red Yeast Cholestehelp\", a lipid-lowering supplement for a period of time. Her kidney dysfunction and Fanconi syndrome improved with the discontinuation of the supplement and correction with oral medications. In Japan, a series of similar health hazards related to the red yeast rice supplement has been reported, but the causative toxin and its causal relationship with AKI have not been established.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Drug-induced tubulointerstitial injury is a common cause of renal impairment. Since the mechanisms of drug-induced tubular injury are diverse, various treatment approaches are needed according to the pathogenesis. Renal biopsy is indispensable to determine not only the pathological diagnosis, but also the underlying mechanism, and to guide appropriate treatment. Most recently, one of the red yeast supplements has been widely highlighted as a novel cause of tubular damage, mainly in Japan and Asia. However, neither detailed pathological findings nor the mechanism of renal impairment has been sufficiently reported. CASE PRESENTATION: Two cases of renal impairment after taking red yeast supplement internally are presented. Both cases showed renal dysfunction with low uric acid, potassium, and phosphorus levels, characteristic features of Fanconi syndrome. The renal biopsy findings of both cases showed severe injury to the proximal tubules with mild inflammatory cell infiltration. The proximal tubules exhibited diffuse loss of the brush border, flattening, and tubular lumen dilation. Immunofluorescence showed no deposition of immunoglobulin and complement in the glomeruli and tubules. Electron microscopic findings indicated proximal tubular damage without crystal deposition. Moreover, immunohistochemistry using the proximal tubular marker CD10 and a marker for distal tubules including the loop of Henle, E-cadherin, collectively demonstrated that the focus of renal injury in both cases was mainly the proximal tubules. CONCLUSIONS: The red yeast rice supplement itself, its metabolized product, or other unknown contaminant components might directly induce proximal tubulopathy rather than an allergic reaction-related tubulointerstitial nephritis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Significant challenges are associated with the pharmacological management of dyslipidemia, an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Limited reliable evidence exists regarding the efficacy of red yeast rice (RYR)-containing commercial Chinese polyherbal preparation (CCPP), despite their widespread use in China. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the efficacy of RYR-containing CCPPs combined with statins in treating dyslipidemia. METHODS: Eight databases were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from database inception date to November 2023. Outcome measures, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions, were assessed. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was used for quality evaluation, and the meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 15.1. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies involving 4,098 participants were included. The combination of RYR-containing CCPP, such as Xuezhikang (XZK), Zhibitai (ZBTAI), or Zhibituo (ZBTUO) with statins had a significant effect on the increase in clinical efficacy [RR:1.16, 95%CI (1.13, 1.19), p < 0.00001]. In addition, they also improved blood lipid profile parameters by increasing HDL-C levels [MD:0.21, 95%CI(0.17, 0.25), p < 0.00001], and decreasing TC [MD: 0.60, 95%CI(-0.76, -0.45), p < 0.00001], TG [MD: 0.33, 95%CI(-0.39, -0.26), p < 0.00001] and LDL-C levels [MD: 0.45, 95%CI(-0.54, -0.36), p < 0.00001]. No significant adverse reactions was observed in the RYR-containing CCPPs. Notably, ZBTAI and XZK significantly reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances and muscular adverse reactions. However, subgroup analyses suggested that the type of CCPPs, dose, and treatment duration might affect the efficacy of RYR-containing CCPPs. CONCLUSION: RYR-containing CCPPs combined with statins appears to improve lipid profiles and clinical efficacy in patients with dyslipidemia. However, due to the poor quality of the included studies, and some studied showing negative findings was unpublished. The results should be interpreted with caution until further confirmation by well-designed RCTs.

We present the case of a 56-year-old woman with Fanconi syndrome that developed after she consumed a red yeast rice supplement. She was referred to our hospital because of renal dysfunction, and was found to have electrolyte abnormalities, including hypophosphatemia and hypouricemia, renal diabetes, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and was, therefore, diagnosed with Fanconi syndrome. Renal biopsy revealed proximal tubular injury characterized by severely degenerated tubular epithelial cells as well as mild hypocellular fibrosis. We speculated that the red yeast rice supplement, which the patient had been consuming for approximately 1 year, might be a cause of her syndrome, because reports of renal dysfunction associated with the consumption of red yeast rice supplements have emerged in Japan since 2024. After the supplement was discontinued and oral prednisolone treatment was initiated, the patient's renal function improved and her electrolyte abnormalities were ameliorated. Furthermore, even after tapering off and discontinuing the prednisolone over approximately 12 weeks, her renal function remained. Because Fanconi syndrome may be caused by various exogenous substances, the taking of a thorough medical history is crucial, including with respect to the use not only of prescription medications, but also other substances, including supplements.",

Since around March 2024, there have been many cases of kidney dysfunction in people who have taken certain supplements containing red yeast rice in Japan. We experienced a case of acute kidney injuries induced after taking a supplement containing red yeast rice. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to renal dysfunction suspected to be caused by taking the supplement Benikoji CholesteHelp®, which contains red yeast rice. With elevations of urinary tubular injury markers such as urinary β2-microglobulin and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, serum creatinine levels were elevated up to 2.75 mg/dL. A kidney biopsy revealed a diagnosis of tubulointerstitial nephritis with lymphocytic infiltration of the interstitium, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrotic changes. After discontinuation of the supplement and initiation of the prednisolone treatment, renal dysfunction rapidly improved. The course of this case suggests tubular damage caused by the supplements containing red yeast rice. For early diagnosis and treatment, it should be noted that even what are regarded as nutritional health supplements can cause renal dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction. An imbalance in the production of Nitric Oxide (NO) and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), leading to impaired NO-cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, contributes to this disorder. Red Yeast Rice (RYR), produced from the fermentation of rice with Monascus purpureus, is a traditional functional food originating from China. Although recognized for its anti-dyslipidemia properties, there has been growing evidence regarding the anti-hypertensive effects of RYR. However, these studies only focused on its direct and short-term effects. AIM: This study aims to investigate the vasoprotective effects of chronic oral RYR administration using Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: SHR were randomly divided into 3 groups: SHR - Control; SHR - RYR extract (100 mg/kg/day); SHR - lovastatin (10 mg/kg/day). Wistar-Kyoto Rats (WKY) were used as normotensive controls. All animals were treated for 12 weeks by oral gavage. Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) was measured weekly (tail-cuff method). Vascular reactivity was determined using isolated rat aortic rings in an organ bath. Aortic ROS, NO, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and cGMP levels were evaluated. RESULTS: Administration of RYR attenuated SBP elevation and enhanced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in aortic rings. In addition, RYR decreased ROS production and significantly improved the level of vascular NO, BH4, and cGMP. CONCLUSION: In an SHR model, treatment with RYR for 12 weeks exerts an SBP lowering effect that can be attributed to improved vascular function via reduction of oxidative stress, decreased endothelial NO Synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and enhanced NO-cGMP pathway.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted from January 2012 to May 2022. The search was strictly focused on clinical trials that examined the association between RYR extract consumption and parameters of the lipid profile in humans. Fourteen double-blinded clinical trials were identified. The interventions lasted 4-24 weeks. In most studies, there was one intervention group and one control group. RYR extract consumption statistically significantly reduced total cholesterol (mean absolute reduction: 37.43 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -47.08, -27.79) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; mean absolute reduction: 35.82 mg/dL; 95% CI: -43.36, -28.29), but not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoproteins A-I and B. As regards the safety, RYR extract was considered a safe choice with neither threatening nor frequent side effects. The consumption of RYR extract by people with hypercholesterolemia was associated with statistically significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-C, whereas it was not associated with an increase in life-threatening side effects. Further research on specific subpopulations and outcomes could establish a consensus on determining the clinical benefits and potential risks, if any, of this nutraceutical.",

In particular, Monascus pigments possess a wide range of biological activities (e.g. antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory or antitumoral). To broaden the scope of their possible application, this study focused on testing Monascus pigment extracts as potential photosensitizing agents efficient in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) against bacteria. For this purpose, eight different extracts of secondary metabolites from the liquid- and solid-state fermentation of Monascus purpureus DBM 4360 and Monascus sp. DBM 4361 were tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative model bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli and further screened for ESKAPE pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To the bacterial culture, increasing concentration of extracts was added and it was found that all extracts showed varying antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria in dark, which was further increased after irradiation. Gram-negative bacteria were tolerant to the extracts' exposure in the dark but sensitivity to almost all extracts that occurred after irradiation. The Monascus sp. DBM 4361 extracts seemed to be the best potential candidate for aPDT against Gram-positive bacteria, being efficient at low doses, i.e. the lowest total concentration of Monascus pigments exhibiting aPDT effect was 3.92 ± 1.36 mg/L for E. coli. Our results indicate that Monascus spp., forming monascuspiloin as the major yellow pigment and not-forming mycotoxin citrinin, is a promising source of antimicrobials and photoantimicrobials.",

Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutraceutical formulation including leucoselect® phytosome®, red yeast rice, policosanol and folic acid on LDL-c levels in patients at low cardiovascular risk with dyslipidemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled all consecutive patients with dyslipidemia at low cardiovascular risk who were unresponsive to diet and physical activity. Clinical assessments and laboratory analyses, encompassing lipid profile, hepatic function, and CPK levels, were performed at baseline prior to initiating treatment and repeated at the 12-week mark following administration of the study nutraceutical. RESULTS: Sixty (60) consecutive patients (mean age 48.02 ± 10.1 years; 60% male) were included. At the 12-week follow-up, a statistically significant reduction in Total Cholesterol (13.1%) and LDL-c serum level (20.4%) was observed. Hepatic and muscular function remain stable over the time. The adherence to therapy was 99% and the persistence was maximum. CONCLUSIONS: The nutraceutical formulation including leucoselect® phytosome® red yeast rice, policosanol and folic acid significantly reduced the LDL-c plasma levels, consistent with previous research showing that the bioactive component in red yeast rice-lovastatin-is effective in addressing problems with lipid metabolism. Importantly, it was safe and well-tolerated among patients with dyslipidemia in a real-world setting."

      "abstract": "Red yeast rice (RYR) is known for its lipid-lowering effects in patients with hypercholesterolemia; however, its comparative efficacy with statins and risk reduction remains uncertain. This retrospective study analyzed data from 337,104 patients with hyperlipidemia in the Chang Gung Research Database cohort, spanning from January 2016 to December 2021. Exclusion criteria were applied to ensure data completeness and compliance, including an age limit of [Formula: see text] years, absence of RYR or statin treatment, and a treatment duration of [Formula: see text] days. Propensity score matching was employed to minimize bias based on baseline factors, with one patient matching with four patients in the comparison group. The study encompassed a total of 5,984 adult hyperlipidemic patients, with 1,197 in the RYR group and 4,787 in the statin group. The patients were also stratified into statin ([Formula: see text]) or combined use ([Formula: see text]) groups for further comparison. Following one year of treatment, both the RYR and statin groups exhibited reductions in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Most biochemical parameters showed no significant differences, except for elevated glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase levels in the RYR group ([Formula: see text]) and increased glycohemoglobin levels in the statin group at the three-month mark ([Formula: see text]). In patients with comorbid diabetes, hypertension, kidney, or liver diseases, RYR and statins demonstrated comparable risks for emergency room (ER) visits, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). However, the combination of RYR and statins was associated with reduced stroke-related hospitalizations in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease, as well as decreased MI-related hospitalizations in patients with hypertension and kidney disease (all [Formula: see text]). In conclusion, both RYR and statins effectively lower blood lipid levels and mitigate related complications. Combining these therapies may lead to fewer ER visits, reduced stroke frequency, and fewer MI hospitalizations in hypertensive and kidney disease patients, and they decreased all-cause mortality in the kidney disease population. Further research on combined therapy is warranted.",

However, the existing meta-analyses concerning the safety of RYR preparations have yielded inconsistent results, and the credibility of the evidence has not been quantified. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and offer a comprehensive understanding of the associations between the use of RYR preparations and various adverse health outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: Seven literature databases were searched from inception to May 5, 2023, using medical subject headings and free-text terms (e.g., \"red yeast rice,\" \"Xuezhikang,\" and \"Zhibitai\"). INCLUSION CRITERIA: Meta-analyses that investigated and quantitatively estimated associations between the use of RYR preparations and adverse health outcomes were included in this study. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two researchers independently extracted data using a standardized data collection table; any disagreements were resolved by consulting a third researcher. Based on the participant, intervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) framework in each eligible meta-analysis, a series of unique associations between the use of RYR preparations and adverse health outcomes were determined. The associations' effect estimates were re-evaluated using random-effect models. RESULTS: Fifteen meta-analyses, comprising 186 (164 unique) randomized controlled trials, were identified. Based on A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews version 2, 3 (20%) and 12 (80%) of these meta-analyses had low and critically low confidence, respectively. A total of 61 unique associations between the use of RYR preparations and adverse health outcomes were extracted from eligible meta-analyses. Based on the random-effect models, 10 (16.4%) associations indicated a significant protective effect of RYR preparations against adverse health outcomes, while 5 (8.2%) indicated an increased risk of adverse health outcomes related to uric acid, alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels. The other 46 (75.4%) associations showed no significant difference between the use of RYR preparations and control treatments. Regarding the credibility of the evidence, 21 (34.4%), 34 (55.7%) and 6 (9.8%) associations showed moderate, low and very low credibility, respectively. CONCLUSION: The evidence examined in this study suggests that RYR preparations are safe; however, the credibility of the evidence was not high. Further high-quality evidence is required.

However, they have rarely been tested in combination. The aim of our study was to test the short-term effect of a combined nutraceutical including red yeast rice and PUFAs on plasma lipids, jigh-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and endothelial function in healthy subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with parallel groups testing the effect of 8 weeks of supplementation with softgels containing red yeast rice (2.8 mg monacolins) and PUFAs (588 mg of fish oil, standardized in PUFAs: 350 EPA, 45 mg DHA) versus placebo. A full lipid panel, hsCRP, and endothelial reactivity were measured at the baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The tested combined nutraceutical was very well tolerated, and after 8 weeks of supplementation it was associated with a 17.3 ±3.4% reduction of lipid-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), a 12.1 ±2.2% reduction of total cholesterol (TC), a 22.3 ±4.3% reduction of apoB, and a -14.9 ±1.8% reduction of hsCRP, as well as a significant improvement of pulse volume change by 5.0 ±0.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The tested combined dietary supplement containing red yeast rice and PUFAs was very well tolerated and significantly improved LDL-C, TC, apoB, hsCRP and endothelial function in healthy subjects with suboptimal LDL-cholesterolaemia."

      "abstract": "Background: Hyperlipidemia is associated with a higher rate of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease. Conventional drugs such as statins are effective in controlling hyperlipidemia; however, they are associated with various side effects, especially myalgia. Nutraceutical lipid-lowering interventions are becoming increasingly popular, particularly among patients who are intolerant or refractory to statins. Substantial preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that extracts of amla, walnut, and olive, and red yeast rice (RYR) powder possess significant antihyperlipidemic effects. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and patient satisfaction of a combined supplementation of standardized dry extracts of amla fruit (500 mg), walnut leaves (50 mg), olive fruit (25 mg), and RYR powder (33.6 mg) (Cholesfytol NG®) in hypercholesterolemic patients. Methods: This was a real-life setting, retrospective, observational, single-arm, non-randomized study in hypercholesterolemic patients (total cholesterol (TC) ≥ 200 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 130 mg/dL), enrolled at 57 general practitioner (GP) surgeries in Belgium from March 2020 to January 2022. These patients received a GP-prescribed daily single dosage of two oral tablets of Cholesfytol NG® supplementation for 2 months to overcome their hypercholesterolemia in the absence of a conventional lipid-lowering drug (n = 208) or with a lipid-lowering drug (n = 13). At 2-month follow-up, the lipid profile was re-evaluated, alongside a patient's questionnaire on treatment general satisfaction and willingness to pursue supplementation. Results: After supplementation, TC decreased by 15%, LDL-C by 19%, non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) by 20% (all p < 0.0001), triglycerides (TG) by 9% (p = 0.0028) (-18.4%, p = 0.0042, in patients with baseline TG > 180 mg/dL, n = 58), and remnant cholesterol (RC) by 12% (p = 0.0001). These changes were unaffected by statin intolerance status in patients who received Cholesfytol NG® alongside statin. The supplement was well tolerated by all patients, and no serious adverse events or supplement-emergent effects were reported. Most patients were satisfied with the supplementation and wanted to pursue the nutraceutical. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, a combined supplementation of amla, walnut, and olive extracts, and RYR powder exerts a significant antihyperlipidemic effect, leading to a decrease in circulatory LDL-C and RC levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The supplementation bears excellent safety and tolerability, and is rated as satisfactory and pursuable, even among patients with statin intolerance.

CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old man presented with progressive limb weakness, muscle soreness, and acute kidney injury (AKI). He had been taking the anti-prostate cancer drug abiraterone for 14 mo and had added a RYR supplement 3 mo before symptom onset. After being diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI, the patient discontinued these drugs and responded well to hemodialysis and hemoperfusion. After 23 d of treatment, creatine kinase levels returned to normal and serum creatinine levels decreased. CONCLUSION: We speculate that statins, the main lipid-lowering component of RYR, or a combination of statins and abiraterone, will increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis."

A 62 years old woman presented to the emergency service with 38.5ºC fever, coluric orine and loss of weight in the previous 3 weeks. The patient was taking RYR since the week before to the initial symptoms. Mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic acute hepatitis was diagnosed. Autoimmune liver serology resulted positive. Total DILI RECAM Score was 8 (highly probable DILI). Conservative treatment with exclusion of RYR was decided and during follow-up bilirubin and transaminases gradually dropped off. It has been reported a few cases of hepatitis associated to the use of RYR, promoted by a toxic or immunogenic metabolite. Cross-reactions may justify positive autoantibodies so hepatotoxicity should not be discard as a diagnose.",

      "abstract": "Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels is a key target for lowering cardiovascular risk and preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Red yeast rice (RYR) is a nutraceutical widely used as a lipid-lowering dietary supplement. The main cholesterol-lowering components of RYR are monacolins, particularly monacolin K, which is structurally identical to lovastatin and targets the same key enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. RYR supplementation reduces LDL-C levels by approximately 15-34% versus placebo, with a similar effect to low-dose, first-generation statins in subjects with mild-to-moderate dyslipidemia. RYR has also demonstrated beneficial reductions of up to 45% versus placebo in the risk of ASCVD events in secondary prevention studies. RYR at a dose that provides about 3 mg/d of monacolin K is well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of low-dose statins. RYR is therefore a treatment option for lowering LDL-C levels and ASCVD risk for people with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia who are ineligible for statin therapy, particularly those who are unable to implement lifestyle modifications, and also for people who are eligible for statin therapy but who are unwilling to take a pharmacologic therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is a prominent cause of cardiovascular disease as it leads to inflammation and plaque deposition within arteries. Treatment includes lifestyle modifications and lipid-lowering medications. We aimed to assess the therapeutic effects of red yeast rice (RYR) alongside statin therapy. METHODS: This triple-blind randomized clinical trial involved 92 dyslipidemia patients and was performed in 2019. Standard laboratory tests were used to assess the serum LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. Subsequently, patients randomly received one daily RYR or placebo tablet for 1 month beside routine single statin therapy. Subsequently, blood tests were repeated and compared against the baseline. Liver function tests were also requested. RESULTS: Total cholesterol significantly (P = 0.019) decreased in the treatment group (- 10.2 mg/dL) compared with the placebo group (- 1.3 mg/dL). HDL cholesterol decreased by 2.19 mg/dL in the treatment group but increased by 0.53 mg/dL in the treatment group (P = 0.083). LDL cholesterol declined in both placebo (- 5.09) and treatment (- 0.73) groups (P = 0.187). TG increased by about 7 mg/dL in the treatment group but fell by roughly 1 mg/dL in the placebo group (P = 0.386). Hs-CRP increased by 0.28 mg/dL in the treatment group but decreased by 0.09 mg/dL in the placebo group (P = 0.336). CONCLUSIONS: We found that adding RYR (Lesstat®) to statin medications significantly decreases total cholesterol. However, no significant effect was seen on other lipid profile components or Hs-CRP. Finally, we showed that RYR is safe to add to statins considering liver function (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05095480)."

Red Yeast Rice (RYR) herbal supplement may be helpful in improving serum fat levels due to some mechanisms. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of RYR consumption on total serum cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels in adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four comprehensive databases (SCOPUS, PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science) were employed until 23 December 2021 RCTs, with 24 treatment arms included after screening 3623 articles. RESULTS: Pooled data showed significant effectiveness in lowering TC (WMD: -33.16 mg/dl, 95% CI: -37.69, -28.63, P < 0.001), LDL-C (WMD: -28.94 mg/dl, 95% CI: -32.90, -24.99, P < 0.001), and TG (WMD: -23.36 mg/dl, 95% CI: -31.30, -15.43, P < 0.001) concentration and increasing HDL-C concentration (WMD: 2.49 mg/dl, 95% CI: 1.48, 3.49, P < 0.001) following RYR supplementation. Furthermore, the effect of this herbal drug in doses less than 1200 mg and with an intervention duration of less than 12 weeks was more in individuals with dyslipidemia. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this comprehensive article and meta-analysis showed that RYR significantly decreases TC, TG, and LDL-C as well as increases HDL-C.",

This study aimed to further evaluate the effects of RYR in carotid atherosclerosis. Several databases were searched for original trials of RYR for the treatment of carotid atherosclerosis that reported plaque indicators. Carotid plaque area (AREA), carotid plaque score (SCORE), and intima-media thickness (IMT) were set as the primary outcomes, while lipid profile and safety indicators were set as the secondary outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed on the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I 2 index and Q statistic. Subgroup, sensitivity, and dose-effect analyses were conducted. Twenty RCTs with 2217 patients were included. Compared to the control group, AREA (SMD = -0.855, 95%CI: -1.259 to -0.451, p < 0.001), IMT (SMD = -0.588, 95%CI: -0.792 to -0.384, p < 0.001), SCORE (SMD = -0.708, 95%CI: -1.135 to -0.282, p = 0.001), LDL-C (SMD = -0.938, 95%CI: -1.375 to -0.502, p < 0.001), triglyceride (SMD = -0.766, 95%CI: -0.980 to -0.551, p < 0.001), and total cholesterol (SMD = -0.858, 95%CI: -1.254 to -0.462, p < 0.001) were significantly decreased and HDL-C (SMD = 0.389, 95%CI: 0.044-0.733, p = 0.027) was significantly increased following RYR therapy. The indicators for safety were not significant and did not differ between the two groups (p > 0.050). Heterogeneities mainly existed for the treatment time or control group setting. Most results showed no changes in the sensitivity analysis. Dose-effect relationships were observed for all indicators except for TC and HDL-C. We concluded that RYR therapy showed considerable efficacy and an acceptable safety profile for the treatment of carotid atherosclerosis in the Chinese population."

      "abstract": "The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is strongly related to lifetime exposure to low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in longitudinal studies. Lipid-lowering therapy (using statins, ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors) substantially ameliorates the risk and is associated with long-term reduction in cardiovascular (CV) events. The robust evidence supporting these therapies supports their continued (and expanding) role in risk reduction. In addition to these 'conventional' therapeutics, while waiting for other innovative therapies, growing evidence supports the use of a range of 'nutraceuticals' (constituents of food prepared as pharmaceutical formulations) including preparations of red yeast rice (RYR), the product of yeast (Monascus purpureus) grown on rice, which is a constituent of food and is used in traditional Chinese medicine. The major active ingredient, monacolin K, is chemically identical to lovastatin. RYR preparations have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in reducing LDL-C, and CV events. However, surprisingly, RYR has received relatively little attention in international guidelines - and conventional drugs with the strongest evidence for event reduction should always be preferred in clinical practice. Nevertheless, the absence of recommendations relating to RYR may preclude the use of a product which may have clinical utility in particular groups of patients (who may anyway self-prescribe this product), what in the consequence might help to reduce population CV risk. This Position Paper of the International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP) will use the best available evidence to give advice on the use of red-yeast rice in clinical practice.",

To understand the anti-aging function of RYR in vivo, this study established a D-galactose-induced aging mouse model to verify the positive effects of RYR dietary intervention on aging and explore the related underlying mechanism. Eight weeks of RYR dietary intervention was shown to have a significant inhibitory effect on cognitive decline and hippocampal damage. The molecular mechanistic studies showed that the anti-aging effects of RYR were achieved by (i) improving the oxidative stress-related damage (increasing SOD, CAT, and GSH, and reducing MDA), (ii) regulating the NF-κB inflammation pathway induced by oxidative stress (decreasing the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, iNOs, and IL-1β, increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and decreasing the expression of the NF-κB protein), (iii) slowing down apoptosis caused by oxidative stress (reducing the expression of P21 and P53), (iv) restoring the abundance of Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae and Rikenellaceae downregulated by D-galactose, and (v) reducing the abundance of Akkermansia and Helicobacter enriched by D-galactose. Mass spectrometry revealed orange pigments (rubropunctatin and monascorubrin) as the main antioxidant components in RYR, which might play key roles in aging inhibition. This study provides theoretical support for the wide application of orange pigments as an antioxidant dietary supplement.",

METHODS: Totally 117 subjects with moderate to severe dyslipidemia (according to Chinese guidelines) and low CV risk were randomly assigned into three treatment groups: lifestyle modification (LM), LM plus a low dosage of MKA, LM plus a high dosage of MKA, and treated for 60 d. The primary endpoint was the reduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC). Safeties along with Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndromes were assessed through the study. RESULTS: A low dosage of MKA along with lifestyle modifications caused a significant decrease in LDL-C by 15.6% on average (95% , 9.6% to 21%) with, a decrease in TC by 15.3% on average (95% CI, 9.26% to 21.4%), and a decrease in non-HDL-C by 35.4% (95% CI, 25.76% to 41.34%). Weak evidence of a reduction of triglycerides but an increment of HDL-C was observed in patients with severe hyperlipidemia. No severe adverse events occurred during the study. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the LDL-C and TC lowering properties of MKA is clinically meaningful. It also produces a significant reduction of non-HDL-C, and slightly effects on TG and HDL-C as well.",

      "abstract": "Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by the cooccurrence of obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension. Red yeast rice (RYR) preparations might be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of MetS. Objective: To implement a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether RYR preparations improve clinical endpoints and reduce risk factors for MetS. Methods: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese VIP Information, and WanFang databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (published up to September 2020), and a meta-analysis was performed using fixed- or random-effects models. The primary outcome measures were mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and the secondary outcome measures were biochemical parameters of blood glucose, blood lipids, and blood pressure. The registration number is CRD42020209186. Results: A total of 921 articles were identified, of which 30 articles were included in this article. RYR preparations group demonstrated significant improvements in MetS compared with control group. RYR preparations reduced the mortality and MACEs (RR = 0.62, 95% CI [0.49, 0.78]; RR = 0.54, 95% CI [0.43, 0.66]). In terms of blood glucose metabolism, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (MD = -0.46 mmol/L, 95% CI [-0.71, -0.22]), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (MD = -0.49, 95% CI [-0.71, -0.26]) and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (MD = -0.93, 95% CI [-1.64, -0.21]) were decreased. Regarding the lipid metabolism, total cholesterol (TC) (MD = -0.74 mmol/L, 95% CI [-1.02, -0.46]), triglycerides (TG) (MD = -0.45 mmol/L, 95% CI [-0.70, -0.21]), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) (MD = -0.42 mmol/L, 95% CI [-0.78, -0.06]) were decreased, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (MD = 0.14 mmol/L, 95% CI [0.09, 0.20]) was increased. Regarding blood pressure, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) (MD = -3.79 mmHg, 95% CI [-5.01, -2.57]) was decreased. In addition, RYR preparations did not increase the incidence of adverse reactions (RR = 1.00, 95% CI [0.69, 1.43]). Conclusion: RYR preparations reduce mortality, MACEs, and multiple risk factors for MetS without compromising safety, which supports its application for the prevention and treatment of MetS. However, additional high-quality studies are needed to provide more evidence for the effect of RYR on MetS due to the heterogeneity in this study.

Moreover, RYR effectively synergized nutraceutical to further reduce TC (MD, -31.10; 95% CI, -38.83 to -23.36; p < 0.00001), LDL-C (MD, -27.91; 95% CI, -36.58 to -19.24; p < 0.00001), and TG (MD, -26.32; 95% CI, -34.05 to -18.59; p < 0.00001). Additionally, RYR significantly reduced apoB (MD, -27.98; 95% CI, -35.51 to -20.45; p < 0.00001) and, whether alone or in combination, did not increase the risk of adverse events in patients with hyperlipidemia. Conclusion: RYR at 200-4800 mg daily appears to be a safe and effective treatment for hyperlipidemia, effectively regulating blood lipid levels with an exceptional impact on TG. Looking forward, high-quality clinical trials with longer observation periods are required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RYR as a long-term medication.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Red yeast rice (RYR), a nutraceutical with a profound cholesterol-lowering effect, was found to attenuate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice. Despite monacolin K in RYR being a specific inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMCGR), the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of RYR against NAFLD are not fully elucidated. METHODS: Using a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and a cellular model of HepG2 cells challenged by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and palmitic acid (PA), the possible molecular mechanisms were exploited in the aspects of NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome and mTORC1-SREBPs signaling pathways by examining the relevant gene/protein expressions. Subsequently, the correlation between these two signals was also verified using cellular experiments. RESULTS: RYR ameliorated lipid accumulation and hepatic inflammation in vivo and in vitro. RYR improved lipid metabolism through modulating mTORC1-SREBPs and their target genes related to triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, RYR suppressed hepatic inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. Interestingly, the treatment with RYR or MCC950, a specific NLRP3 inhibitor, resulted in the reduced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells challenged by LPS plus PA, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of RYR on NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated hepatic inflammation may partially, in turn, contribute to the lipid-lowering effect of RYR. CONCLUSIONS: The modulation of NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome and lipid synthesis may contribute to the ameliorative effects of RYR against HFD-induced NAFLD."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia. METHODS: Relevant literature published until 13 August 2021, was retrieved from six electronic databases. Randomized clinical trials of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice in patients with hyperlipidaemia were included in the review. Network meta-analysis was performed using Stata 13.1 software. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve probability values were used to rank the treatments. RESULTS: This study included 47 trials involving 4824 subjects. In terms of reduced total cholesterol levels, Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 84.5%) had the highest probability of being the most effective formulation, with Simvastatin (66.4%) and Zhibitai (65.4%) ranked second and third, respectively. Xuezhikang also had the highest probability of reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to the greatest extent (SUCRA: 82.6%) with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 74.9%) and Zhibituo (SUCRA: 52.8%) being the second and third choices, respectively. For reduced triglyceride levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 80.2%) exhibited the highest probability of being the most effective, with Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 63.4%) and Simvastatin (SUCRA: 57.6%) in second and third places, respectively. Finally, in terms of improving high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 90.1%) had the highest probability of being the most effective, with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 82.1%) and Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 51.1%) ranked second and third, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Xuezhikang was found to have the highest probability of being the most effective formulation for reducing total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, while Zhibituo had the highest probability of being the most effective for controlling triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The studies included in the review exhibited certain limitations and, therefore, more rigorously designed studies should be performed.

(2) Aim: To compare adherence to Mediterranean diet (Med-D), orthorexia nervosa (ON), and musculoskeletal pain in individuals in treatment with statins metabolized by CYP3A4, not metabolized by CYP3A4 or red yeast rice (RYR, containing monacolin K: MON-K). (3) Methods: starting from 80 individuals, after the exclusion of those with other causes of possible pain, 56 individuals were selected and divided into three groups according to the type of statin (CYP3A4, NO-CYP3A4 and MON-K). Adherence to the Med-D was evaluated with the MEDScore and a sub-score was calculated for fruit and vegetables consumption (MEDScore-FV). ON and musculoskeletal pain were assessed with the ORTO-15 and with the Nordic Musculoskeletal questionnaires, respectively. A retrospective analysis of CHOL decrease after treatment was conducted. (4) Results: CHOL levels were lower in CYP3A4 and NO-CYP3A4 after treatment (182.4 ± 6.3 and 177.0 ± 7.8 mg/dL, respectively), compared with MON-K (204.2 ± 7.1 mg/dL, p < 0.05). MON-K and CYP3A4 groups had a high prevalence of reported knee pain (33.3% and 18.8%, respectively) than NO-CYP3A4 group (0%, p < 0.05). A high percentage of individuals in MON-K take supplements and nutraceuticals (87.5%), whereas MEDScore-FV was higher in CYP3A4 (9.4 ± 0.2) compared to NO-CYP3A4 (7.6 ± 0.5, p < 0.05). (5) Conclusions: This study suggests that individuals receiving treatment with statins and RYR should be monitored from the perspective of plant foods' consumption and nutraceutical use, to prevent musculoskeletal pain."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Red yeast rice contains monacolin K, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, and gamma-aminobutyric acid, a neurotransmitter. The daily dose of red yeast rice and monacolin K in previous studies was relatively high; therefore, there were safety concerns. We aimed to examine the effects of low daily dose red yeast rice on arteriosclerosis in patients with mild dyslipidemia. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Eighteen patients without known cardiovascular disease and unsatisfactory low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.96±0.19 mmol/L) controlled only by diet therapy were randomly allocated to receive low dose red yeast rice (200 mg/day) containing 2 mg monacolin K or diet therapy alone for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the absolute change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Secondary outcomes included total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and blood pressure. RESULTS: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly in the red yeast rice group than in the diet therapy group (median [interquartile range]: control -0.20 [-0.62, 1.19] mmol/L vs. red yeast rice -0.96 [-1.05, -0.34] mmol/L, p=0.030). The red yeast rice group also exhibited significant decreases in total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and blood pressure. No severe treatment-related adverse effects on muscles, liver, or renal function were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients in the red yeast rice group exhibited significant reductions in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and blood pressure without any recognised adverse effect. This suggests that low daily dose red yeast rice could reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with dyslipidemia.",

However, the influence of Xuezhikang on the non-fasting levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) has not been explored in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: Fifty CHD patients were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups (n = 25 each) to receive 1,200 mg/d of Xuezhikang or a placebo for 6 weeks as routine therapy. Blood lipids were repeatedly measured before and after 6 weeks of treatment at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after a standard breakfast containing 800 kcal and 50 g of fat. Results: The serum LDL-C levels significantly decreased, from a fasting level of 3.88 mmol/L to non-fasting levels of 2.99, 2.83, and 3.23 mmol/L at 2, 4, and 6 h, respectively, after breakfast (P < 0.05). The serum non-HDL-C level mildly increased from a fasting level of 4.29 mmol/L to non-fasting levels of 4.32, 4.38, and 4.34 mmol/L at 2, 4, and 6 h post-prandially, respectively, and the difference reached statistical significance only at 4 and 6 h after breakfast (P < 0.05). After 6 weeks of Xuezhikang treatment, the patients had significantly lower fasting and non-fasting serum levels of LDL-C and non-HDL-C (P < 0.05) than at pretreatment. The LDL-C levels were reduced by 27.8, 28.1, 26.2, and 25.3% at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h, respectively, and the non-HDL-C levels were reduced by 27.6, 28.7, 29.0, and 28.0% at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h, respectively, after breakfast. No significant difference was found in the percent reductions in the LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels among the four different time-points. Conclusions: Six weeks of Xuezhikang treatment significantly decreased LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels, with similar percent reductions in fasting and non-fasting states in CHD patients, indicating that the percent change in non-fasting LDL-C or non-HDL-C could replace that in the fasting state for evaluation the efficacy of cholesterol control in CHD patients who are unwilling or unable to fast."

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a nutraceutical multitargeted approach on lipid profile and inflammatory markers along with vascular remodelling in a cohort of dyslipidemic subjects without history of cardiovascular (CV) disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 25 subjects (mean age 48.2 years) with low to moderate CV risk profile and total cholesterol (TC) levels between 150 and 250 mg/dl. The patients were assigned to receive for one year a tablet/die of a nutraceutical combination containing red yeast rice (RYR) extract (Monacolin 3 mg/tablet) and coenzyme Q10 (30 mg/tablet). Treatment with the nutraceutical compounds led to a significant reduction of TC (from 227 to 201 mg/dl, p < 0.001), LDL-c (from 150 to 130 mg/dl, p = 0.001), triglycerides (from 121 to 109 mg/dl, p = 0.013), non-HDL-cholesterol (from 168 to 141 mg/dl, p < 0.001), hs-CRP (from 1.74 to 1.20 mg/l, p = 0.015), and osteoprotegerin (from 1488 to 1328 pg/ml, p = 0.045). Levels of HDL-c, Lp(a), glucose, liver enzyme, CPK, or creatinine did not change over time. An ultrasound study was performed to assess changes in mean carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and maximum IMT (M-MAX) as well as modification in local carotid stiffness by means of determining the carotid compliance coefficient (CC) and distensibility coefficient (DC). At the end of the treatment, we observed small but significant reductions in both mean-IMT (from 0.62 to 0.57 mm, p = 0.022) and M-MAX (from 0.79 to 0.73 mm, p = 0.002), and an improvement in carotid elasticity (DC from 22.4 to 24.3 × 10-3/kPa, p = 0.006 and CC from 0.77 to 0.85 mm2/kPa, p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: A long-term treatment with a combination of RYR and coenzyme Q10 showed lipid-lowering activity along with a reduction of inflammatory mediators and an improvement of vascular properties in young subjects with a low-to-moderate CV risk profile.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Increased serum cholesterol levels constitute one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Statins are a major method for reducing the levels which also lower the risk of cardiovascular events. However, these valuable drugs cannot be used in all patients who need them due to contraindications and intolerance. In such cases, help can be sought from nutraceutics that reduce the serum cholesterol concentration. Since there are numerous products of this type available at drugstores, registered as supplements, there seems to be a need to demonstrate their effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular diseases induced by atherosclerosis. In literature, increasingly more attention is drawn to red yeast rice, Armolipid, berberine and bergamot. BRIEF DESCRIPTION: This article presents knowledge about these nutraceutics based on clinical studies and expert statements relating to their use. The results of clinical studies and metaanalyses have shown that nutraceutics with cholesterol lowering properties, red yeast rice and Armolipid are the most favourable for reducing cardiovascular events. However, the evidence of benefits of berberine and bergamot is not so conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Red yeast rice products and Armolipid may be used as an alternative treatment in statin intolerant patients, especially in combination with ezetimibe. These nutraceutics can be also considered, as an adjunct to diet therapy in primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in patients with mild and moderate hypercholesterolaemia. The opinion of experts on berberine and bergamot is ambiguous.",

The patients who take red fermented rice consciously choose an alternative agent in the field of phytotherapy because they already have to take several conventional medicines and are no longer willing to use an additional drug of this kind.

      "abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, edema, necrosis, etc. Studies have reported that some dietary nutrition factors have beneficial effects in improving ALD. Red yeast rice (RYR), a traditional herbal supplement, has been confirmed to lower cholesterol mainly due to its component monacolin K. However, the effect of RYR on ALD has not been investigated. In this study, mice were supplemented with a daily oral gavage of 4 g/kg 50% ethanol for 8 weeks to induce a chronic ALD. RYR (150 mg kg-1  day-1 ) was supplied to ALD mice in treatment group. The results showed that RYR supplementation significantly attenuated hyperlipidemia, elevated circulating inflammatory cytokines, hepatic structural damage, and oxidative stress in mice supplemented with alcohol with no effects on body weight. Moreover, RYR significantly suppressed alcohol-induced hepatic NF-κB activation and apoptosis. Our results suggest that RYR is capable of preventing ALD mainly by attenuating hepatic oxidative stress and inflammatory response. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: RYR was known for cholesterol-lowering effect through its main component monacolin K. The current study revealed that RYR was capable of ameliorating ALD, which is characterized by profound dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, edema, etc. Our results indicated that the protective effect of RYR on ALD is largely achieved by regulating lipid metabolism, and closely related to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of RYR. This study provides research foundation for the development of RYR-related food or pharmaceutical products, especially targeting for ALD.",

The experimental results show that, compared with the high-fat model group, the weight growth rate, liver weight ratio, kidney weight ratio, spleen weight ratio, and fat weight ratio of rats in the gavage lovastatin (LOV), RYR, and PIG group were all significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Intervention with RYR and PIG can significantly reduce the serum TC, TG, and LDL-C levels, which has the effect of lowering blood lipids. The 16SrDNA sequencing results showed that the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes decreased significantly (p ≤ 0.01) after the intervention of LOV, RYR, and PIG; the abundance of the ratio of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Bacteroidales-S24-7-group also changed. The combined analysis of transcriptome and metabolome showed that lovastatin, RYR, and PIG can all improve lipid metabolism in rats by regulating Steroid hormone biosynthesis, Glycerolipid metabolism, and the Arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. In addition, RYR and PIG also have a unique way of regulating blood lipids. Although a lot of research on the lipid-lowering components of Monascus rice and the single pigment component of Monascus has been carried out, the actual application is RYR and pigments as mixtures, as a mixture of RYR and PIG contains a variety of biologically active ingredients, and each component may have a synergistic effect. Hence it has a lipid-lowering mechanism that lovastatin does not have. Therefore, RYR and PIG are effective in reducing lipid potential development and can be utilized in functional foods."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxysterol relationship with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors is poorly explored, especially in moderately hypercholesterolaemic subjects. Moreover, the impact of nutraceuticals controlling hypercholesterolaemia on plasma levels of 24-, 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC, 25-OHC, 27-OHC) is unknown. METHODS: Subjects (n = 33; 18-70 years) with moderate hypercholesterolaemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C:): 130-200 mg/dL), in primary CV prevention as well as low CV risk were studied cross-sectionally. Moreover, they were evaluated after treatment with a nutraceutical combination (Bifidobacterium longum BB536, red yeast rice extract (10 mg/dose monacolin K)), following a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. We evaluated 24-OHC, 25-OHC and 27-OHC levels by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS: 24-OHC and 25-OHC were significantly correlated, 24-OHC was correlated with apoB. 27-OHC and 27-OHC/total cholesterol (TC) were higher in men (median 209 ng/mL and 77 ng/mg, respectively) vs. women (median 168 ng/mL and 56 ng/mg, respectively); 27-OHC/TC was significantly correlated with abdominal circumference, visceral fat and, negatively, with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Triglycerides were significantly correlated with 24-OHC, 25-OHC and 27-OHC and with 24-OHC/TC and 25-OHC/TC. After intervention, 27-OHC levels were significantly reduced by 10.4% in the nutraceutical group Levels of 24-OHC, 24-OHC/TC, 25-OHC, 25-OHC/TC and 27-OHC/TC were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, conducted in moderate hypercholesterolemic subjects, we observed novel relationships between 24-OHC, 25-OHC and 27-OHC and CV risk biomarkers. In addition, no adverse changes of OHC levels upon nutraceutical treatment were found.",

This study aimed to test whether a nutraceutical combination of these 3 materials prevented dedifferentiation of pancreatic β cells. Male db/db mice (8 weeks of age) were allocated into four groups (DB, DB/L, DB/M, and DB/H; n = 8-10) and fed a high-fat diet containing 0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, or 1% nutraceutical, respectively, whereas wild-type mice receiving a standard diet served as a healthy control (C; n = 10). The nutraceutical contained 10 mg/g monacolin K, 165 µg/g chromium, and 300 mg/g bitter gourd. After 8-weeks dietary treatment, diabetic syndromes (including hyperglycemia, hyperphagia, excessive drinking, polyuria, glucosuria, albuminuria, and glucose intolerance), were improved by the nutraceutical in a dose-dependent fashion. Decreased insulin and increased glucagon in serum and pancreatic islets in db/db mice were abolished in the DB/H group. Furthermore, supplementation curtailed dedifferentiation of β cells, as evidenced by decreasing the dedifferentiation marker (Aldh1a3) and increasing β-cell-enriched genes and transcription factors (Ins1, Ins2, FOXO1, and NKX6.1), as well as nuclear localization of NKX6.1 in pancreatic islets when compared to the DB group. We concluded that this nutraceutical, a combination of Monascus purpureus, Momordica charantia, and chromium, could be used as an adjunct for type 2 diabetes treatment and delay disease progression by sustaining β-cell function."

They comprise atherosclerosis dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. However, there is no single drug that can simultaneously treat multiple diseases with complex underlying mechanisms. Therefore, it is necessary to identify a class of adjuvant drugs that block the development of metabolic diseases from a preventive perspective. Red yeast rice is a food fermentation product widely used to promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis. Modern pharmacology has shown that red yeast rice exerts potential protective effects on the liver, pancreas, blood vessels, and intestines. Therefore, this study was carried out to analyze and summarize the effect of red yeast rice on several metabolic diseases and the mechanisms of action involved. It was found that red yeast rice may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases.",

METHODS: Chinese and English language databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Elsevier, Google Scholar, SpringerLink, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Weipu Chinese Sci-tech periodical full-text database (VIP), and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (Wanfang), were searched from their establishment to February 2020 using the following terms: \"hongqu,\" \"red yeast rice,\" \"Monascus purpureus-fermented rice,\" \"bone mineral density,\" \"osteoblast,\" \"osteoporosis,\" and \"animal models.\" After excluding nonrelevant articles, Review Manager 5.2 was used to evaluate article quality and to analyze the data. Outcome indicators included bone mineral density (BMD), osteoblast proliferation, and the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). RESULTS: A total of 11 randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis, all of which were animal studies. Six studies included data on BMD, five on osteoblast proliferation, and six on the expression of ALP. The results of the meta-analysis showed that RYR can significantly improve BMD (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 3.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 4.83, P = 0.0003), promote osteoblast proliferation (SMD = 1.64, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.23, P < 0.00001), and increase ALP expression in rats (SMD = 1.25, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.80, P < 0.00001).

Results showed that RYR can alleviate S. enterica infection in vivo and Monascus pigments are the main functional components. The analysis of microbiota, gene expression profile and serological immunology revealed that RYR can regulate the intestinal flora and increase the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Akkermansia. Meanwhile, RYR is also found to regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory factors and tight junction-related genes to inhibit the NO and NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response and maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier.

Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries worldwide. An increasing attention is now paid to nutraceuticals development for prevention and cure of dyslipidemia, especially for patients who do not wish to use chemical statins. The cholesterol lowering effect and the tolerability of NutraforChol®, a nutraceutical product containing red yeast rice extract, guggulipid extract and chromium picolinate, was evaluated on subjects who had total cholesterol level 200-239 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol level 100-159 mg/dL. In this study, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study which consisted of 4 weeks run-in period and 8 weeks treatment period was performed. Based on the study results, NutraforChol® effectively decreased total cholesterol (-15.9 %) and LDL level (-19.9 %) after two weeks consumption. The total cholesterol and LDL reduction were maintained during 8 weeks study period. At study termination (week 8), there was a significant difference between total cholesterol level of NutraforChol® treated group (173.5 ± 21.7 mg/dL) and placebo-treated group (204.5 ± 22.8 mg/dL) (p < 0.05). In addition, there was a significant difference between LDL level at week 8 in NutraforChol® group (115.5 ± 22.2 mg/dL) and placebo-treated group (145.1 ± 23.7 mg/dL) (p < 0.05). The tolerability of NutraforChol® was also evaluated. There were no significant changes (p > 0.05) on renal and liver function parameters between baseline and study termination. Thus, NutraforChol® may be considered as a complementary or alternative safe nutraceuticals for the treatment of mild dyslipidemic subjects.",

More than 101 chemical constituents have been isolated from RYR, mainly consisting of monacolins, pigments, organic acids, sterols, decalin derivatives, flavonoids, polysaccharides, and other compounds. Crude extracts of RYR, as well as its isolated compounds, possess broad pharmacological properties with hypolipidemic, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-cancer, neurocytoprotective, anti-osteoporotic, anti-fatigue, anti-diabetic, and anti-hypertensive activities. However, further studies are needed to characterize its diverse chemical constituents and the toxicological actions of the main bioactive compounds. New pharmacological trials addressing the overlooked traditional uses of RYR, such as in the treatment of indigestion and diarrhea, are required."

Clinical studies suggest that red yeast rice (RYR) has the potential to reduce blood lipid levels. However, the mechanisms under which RYR regulates atherosclerosis by affecting the composition of the gut microbiome have not been elucidated. In the current study, results showed that treatment with RYR significantly decreased the plaque formation and levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) compared with the atherosclerotic model group which were fed with a high-fat diet. In addition, the height of enteral villus in the red Monascus group was increased, indicating that RYR can improve the intestinal barrier function. Further analysis revealed that RYR might attenuate atherosclerosis through inhibiting hydroxy methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and the consequent inflammatory signaling pathways mediated by TLR2 and TLR4. Moreover, the RYR treatment led to significant structural changes on the intestinal microbiota of high-fat diet-fed mice and reduced the relative abundance of Alistipes and Flavonifractor that exhibited positive relationships with the plasma levels of cholesterol and LDL. Collectively, these findings illustrated that RYR could significantly protect against atherosclerosis, which was possibly associated with the alterations in the gut microbiota composition.",

Because redox imbalance has been implicated, among other factors, in the pathophysiology of CDs, antioxidant compounds may have a beneficial effect in their treatment. Red yeast rice (RYR), besides its lipid-lowering effect, exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. METHODS: Thirty-five schizophrenia outpatients (age range, 18-60 years) on stable antipsychotic treatment and assessed by neuropsychological (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [WCST], Verbal Fluency, and Stroop task) and psychodiagnostic instruments (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) received RYR at daily dosage of 200 mg/d (total monacolin K/capsule content, 11.88 mg) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Red yeast rice supplementation significantly improved WCST \"perseverative errors\" (P = 0.015), \"total errors\" (P = 0.017, P = 0.001), and phonemic fluency test (P = 0.008); a trend for improvement on other WCST variables (\"nonperseverative errors,\" \"perseverative responses,\" and \"categories\") was observed. Effect sizes, according to Cohen's suggestions, were small in all explored cognitive dimensions. There were no significant change in clinical symptoms and no subject-reported adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite several limitations (open design, lack of a control group, short period of observation, small sample size, mode of controlling patients' compliance, the lack of assessment of patients' functional improvement), results suggest that RYR supplementation may be a potentially promising strategy for addressing CDs in schizophrenia; further randomized, placebo-controlled studies are needed to better evaluate the potential role of RYR for the treatment of CDs in schizophrenia.",

Their effect on lipid profile is well known, but few data are available on their effect on endothelial function. Objectives: To study the effect of a novel nutraceutical compound (NC) containing low monacolin K dose, polymethoxyflavones and antioxidants on lipid profile, endothelial function and oxidative stress. Methods: Fifty-two subjects with low-moderate CV risk and dyslipidaemia (according to European guidelines) were enrolled and treated for 8 weeks with the NC. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of treatment to assess changes in lipid profile, endothelial function and oxidative stress. The primary endpoint was the reduction of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Endothelial function was assessed through measurement of rate of apoptosis and nitric oxide (NO) production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with subject's serum. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) were markers of oxidative stress. Results: Fifty subjects completed the study. The treatment caused a significant decrease in LDL (-15.6%, p < 0.001), oxLDL (-21.5%, p < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, and ApoB. Apoptosis rate of HUVECs significantly decreased (-15.9%, p < 0.001). No changes were noted for NO levels and 4-HNE protein adducts. The reduction of the apoptosis rate was correlated to the reduction of oxLDL. Conclusion: An 8-week treatment based on a novel NC containing low manocolin K dose, polymethoxyflavones and antioxidants improved lipid profile in subjects with dyslipidaemia and low-moderate CV risk. Secondarily, we observed an improvement in surrogate markers of endothelial function that may result from the reduction of oxLDL (Registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03216811)."

According to the previous studies, other compounds, besides monacolin K in RYR, may also reduce the serum lipid level. This study aims at examining the efficacy of monacolin K-rich and Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)-rich RYR (Monascus pilosus) with regards to treating hyperlipidemia in a randomized control, double-blind clinical trial. In the research, we assigned 50 eligible subjects to monacolin K-rich RYR, GABA-rich RYR and placebo groups ( n=16 , 17, 17, respectively). The concentrations of TC, LDL-C, HDL, TG and blood biochemical data were evaluated at different phases: before applying (visit 1), after 1-month (visit 2), 2-month (visit 3), 3-month (visit 4) of providing the intervention and 1-month after ending the test food (visit 5) among three groups. During the 3-month intervention, the serum TC and LDL-C levels decreased significantly in the monacolin K group compared to the baseline and the other two groups. The Serum TG level declined steadily but was not statistically significant. Meanwhile, no marked differences in the serum HDL level were revealed among the three groups. Most safety assessment data had minor variation except two subjects (in monacolin K and GABA group separately) reported elevated liver enzymes. Monacolin K-rich RYR can reduce cholesterol as expected, while the GABA-rich RYR performed non-significant reduction on serum triglyceride. The research results demonstrate that using different concentrations and ratios between monacolin K and GABA could be beneficial for antihyperlipidemia.",

      "abstract": "Recently, concerns regarding the safety of red yeast rice (RYR) have been raised after the publication of some case reports claiming toxicity. Since the previous meta-analyses on the effects of RYR were mainly focused on its efficacy to improve lipid profile and other cardiovascular parameters, we carried out a meta-analysis on safety data derived from the available randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Primary outcomes were musculoskeletal disorders (MuD). Secondary outcomes were non-musculoskeletal adverse events (Non-MuD) and serious adverse events (SAE). Subgroups analyses were carried out considering the intervention (RYR alone or in association with other nutraceutical compounds), monacolin K administered daily dose (≤3, 3.1-5 or >5 mg/day), follow-up (>12 or ≤12 weeks), with statin therapy or statin-intolerance and type of control treatment (placebo or statin treatment). Data were pooled from 53 RCTs comprising 112 treatment arms, which included 8535 subjects, with 4437 in the RYR arm and 4303 in the control one. Monacolin K administration was not associated with increased risk of MuD (odds ratio (OR) = 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53,1.65). Moreover, we showed reduced risk of Non-MuD (OR = 0.59, 95%CI 0.50, 0.69) and SAE (OR = 0.54, 95%CI 0.46, 0.64) vs. control. Subgroups analyses confirmed the high tolerability profile of RYR. Furthermore, increasing daily doses of monacolin K were negatively associated with increasing risk of Non-MuD (slope: -0.10; 95%CI: -0.17, -0.03; two-tailed p < 0.01). Based on our data, RYR use as lipid-lowering dietary supplement seems to be overall tolerable and safe in a large kind of moderately hypercolesterolaemic subjects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Probiotics incorporated into dairy products have been shown to reduce total (TC) and LDL cholesterolemia (LDL-C) in subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia. More specifically, probiotics with high biliary salt hydrolase activity, e.g. Bifidobacterium longum BB536, may decrease TC and LDL-C by lowering intestinal cholesterol reabsorption and, combined with other nutraceuticals, may be useful to manage hypercholesterolemia in subjects with low cardiovascular (CV) risk. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nutraceutical combination containing Bifidobacterium longum BB536, red yeast rice (RYR) extract (10 mg/day monacolin K), niacin, coenzyme Q10 (Lactoflorene Colesterolo®). The end-points were changes of lipid CV risk markers (LDL-C, TC, non-HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), HDL-C, apolipoprotein AI (ApoAI), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)), and of markers of cholesterol synthesis/absorption. METHODS: A 12-week randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Thirty-three subjects (18-70 years) in primary CV prevention and low CV risk (SCORE: 0-1% in 24 and 2-4% in 9 subjects; LDL-C: 130-200 mg/dL) were randomly allocated to either nutraceutical (N = 16) or placebo (N = 17). RESULTS: Twelve-week treatment with the nutraceutical combination, compared to placebo, significantly reduced TC (- 16.7%), LDL-C (- 25.7%), non-HDL-C (- 24%) (all p < 0.0001), apoB (- 17%, p = 0.003). TG, HDL-C, apoAI, Lp(a), PCSK9 were unchanged. Lathosterol:TC ratio was significantly reduced by the nutraceutical combination, while campesterol:TC ratio and sitosterol:TC ratio did not change, suggesting reduction of synthesis without increased absorption of cholesterol. No adverse effects and a 97% compliance were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week treatment with a nutraceutical combination containing the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum BB536 and RYR extract significantly improved the atherogenic lipid profile and was well tolerated by low CV risk subjects.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the hypolipidaemic activities of different Monascus pigments (yellow, red and orange pigments) and elucidate their possible regulatory mechanisms on lipid and cholesterol metabolism in rats fed on a high-fat diet (HFD). Results showed that oral administrations of Monascus yellow, red and orange pigments can markedly alleviate the disturbance of lipid metabolism through ameliorating the serum lipid levels and suppressing hepatic lipid accumulation and steatosis. Meanwhile, the excretion of fecal cholesterol, triacylglycerols and bile acids was also promoted by the oral administrations of different Monascus pigments (MPs). Furthermore, Monascus pigment (MP) supplementation produced significant structural changes in the intestinal microbiota of HFD-fed rats, and modulated the relative abundance of functionally related microbial phylotypes compared with the HFD group in particular. Key phylotypes in response to the HFD and Monascus pigment (MP) intervention were found to strongly correlate with the lipid metabolism disorder associated parameters using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Some beneficial gut microbiota (such as Oscillibacter sp., Ruminococcus albus, Clostridium sp., etc.) were found to be negatively correlated with the serum and hepatic lipid indicator. Moreover, Monascus pigment (MP) treatments regulated the mRNA expression levels of the genes responsible for lipid and cholesterol metabolism. In general, different Monascus pigments (MPs) regulate the homeostasis of lipid and cholesterol metabolism through different regulatory pathways. These findings illustrated that not only Monascus yellow pigments, but also Monascus red and orange pigments have the potential to ameliorate lipid metabolic disorders, and therefore could be used as potential functional food ingredients for the prevention or treatment of hyperlipidemia and gut microbiota dysbiosis.",

The Panel reviewed the scientific evidences available as well as the information provided by interested parties in response of a public 'Call for data' launched by EFSA. The Panel considered that monacolin K in lactone form is identical to lovastatin, the active ingredient of several medicinal products authorised for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in the EU. On the basis of the information available, the Panel concluded that intake of monacolins from RYR via food supplements, could lead to estimated exposure to monacolin K within the range of the therapeutic doses of lovastatin. The Panel considered that the available information on the adverse effects reported in humans were judged to be sufficient to conclude that monacolins from RYR when used as food supplements were of significant safety concern at the use level of 10 mg/day. The Panel further considered that individual cases of severe adverse reactions have been reported for monacolins from RYR at intake levels as low as 3 mg/day. The Panel concluded that exposure to monacolin K from RYR could lead to severe adverse effects on musculoskeletal system, including rhabdomyolysis, and on the liver. In the reported cases, the product contained other ingredients in addition to RYR. However, these reported effects in particular musculoskeletal effects, have both occurred after ingestion of monacolin K and lovastatin independently. On the basis of the information available and several uncertainties highlighted in this opinion, the Panel was unable to identify a dietary intake of monacolins from RYR that does not give rise to concerns about harmful effects to health, for the general population, and as appropriate, for vulnerable subgroups of the population."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have a negative impact on metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors for their effects on body weight and on metabolic parameters. Statins are widely used in the treatment of dyslipidemia; less is known on the ability of statins to treat SGAs-induced dyslipidemia, and nutraceutical approaches may represent promising strategies in SGAs-treated patients. Red Yeast Rice (RYR), the fermented product of the Aspergillaceae mold Monascus purpureus (red yeast) grown on white rice, has been shown to have a cholesterol-lowering effect which can be ascribed to monacolin K, although other active compounds may play a role management of hyperlipidemia. The present study was aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of RYR treatment on clinical and metabolic parameters in a sample of subjects receiving SGAs. METHODS: Fifteen outpatients treated with SGAs assumed RYR at the oral daily dose of 200 mg/day (total monacolin K = 11.88 mg) for 30 days. Fasting levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and glucose were determined. RESULTS: RYR administration resulted in a statistically significant reduction of LDL (p = 0.029), corresponding to 11.0% decrease from baseline mean value. No significant differences in clinical and in other and metabolic parameters were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RYR, at the daily dose of 200 mg for 30 days, could be a promising agent to prevent and/or treat SGAs-induced hyperlipidemia. However, future adequately-powered and well-designed studies with long-term follow-up should evaluate RYR effectiveness, as an alternative option to statins, on the SGAs-induced metabolic side effects.",

We showed that low-dose (600 mg/kg/d) XZK improved plaque stability without decreasing plaque area, whereas high-dose (1200 mg/kg/d) XZK dramatically inhibited vulnerable plaque progression accompanied by decreased plaque area. Mechanistically, XZK significantly suppressed lesional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in mouse carotid arteries. In vitro, XZK inhibited 7-KC-induced activation of ER stress in RAW264.7 macrophages, as assessed by the reduced levels of p-PERK, p-IRE1α, p-eIF2α, c-ATF6, s-XBP1, and CHOP. Compared to controls, the XZK-treated group displayed dramatically decreased apoptotic cell numbers (shown by decreased TUNEL- and cleaved caspase3-positive cells), lower necrotic core area and ratio, and reduced expression of NF-κB target gene. In RAW264.7 cells, XZK inhibited 7-KC-induced upregulation of apoptosis, protein expression of apoptotic markers (cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP), and NF-κB activation (shown by target gene transcription and IκBα reduction). Collectively, our results suggest that XZK effectively suppresses vulnerable plaque progression and rupture by mitigating macrophage ER stress and consequently inhibiting apoptosis and the NF-κB pro-inflammatory pathway, thereby providing an alternative therapeutic strategy for stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques.",

A 2-months observational non-randomized study was performed to evaluate the efficacy, tolerance and safety of Cholesfytol® (1 tablet/day) in 642 hypercholesterolemic patients (mean age: 59 yrs; total cholesterol (TC) ≥200; LDL-C ≥140mg/dl). Patients were followed by 126 GPs, and included irrespective of SAMS history and/or diabetes. None of the patients were taking statins or other lipid-modifying therapy at inclusion. At baseline, 26% had fasting glucose >100 ≤125mg/dL, and 5% >125mg/dL; 32% (n=194) had a SAMS history; and 21% had atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD). In the entire cohort, pre-treatment TC; non-HDL-C; LDL-C; and TG were 259; 200; 168; 158mg/dL, respectively, and decreased significantly on treatment (-17.5% (TC) and -23.3% (LDL-C)). Fasting glucose and HbA1c decreased between visits. The reduction in lipids was greater in patients with higher values at baseline. For comparable pre-treatment values, patients with SAMS history had reductions in TC, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB100 slightly less than patients without myalgia. AD patients had greater on-treatment decrease in TG. Overall, 13 patients reported minor side-effects, and 4 patients reporting myalgia had antecedent SAMS. In conclusion, a substantial decrease in LDL-C was obtained with a combination of RYR and olive extract in high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients, without inducing new-onset SAMS.",

Our aim was to test the effect on lipid profile of phytosterols, red yeast rice and their association. METHODS: We performed a three parallel arms, double blind, clinical trial randomizing 90 moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects to treatment with phytosterols 800 mg (group 1), red yeast rice standardized to contain 5 mg monacolins from Monascus purpureus (group 2), or both combined nutraceuticals (group 3). RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, in group 1 no significant variation of lipid parameters has been detected. In group 2 a significant reduction (p < 0.001) of LDL-Cholesterol (-20.5% vs. baseline) and Apolipoprotein B (-14.4% vs. baseline) as it occurred in group 3 (LDL-Cholesterol vs. baseline: -27.0%, Apolipoprotein B vs. baseline: -19.0%) (P < 0.001). LDL-Cholesterol and Apolipoprotein B changes were significantly different comparing group 2 with group 1 (P < 0.05), and group 3 with group 1 (P < 0.05). LDL-Cholesterol change was also significantly higher in group 3 than in group 2 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The association of phytosterol and red yeast rice seems to have additive cholesterol lowering effect, reaching a clinically significant LDL-Cholesterol reduction in mildly hypercholesterolemic patients.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of red yeast rice (RYR) on blood lipid levels, aortic atherosclerosis (AS), and plaque stability in apolipoprotein E gene knockout (ApoE-/-) mice. METHODS: Twenty-four ApoE-/- mice were fed with a high-fat diet starting from 6 weeks of age. Mice were randomized into three groups (n = 8 in each group): model group (ApoE-/- group), RYR group (ApoE-/- + RYR group), and simvastatin group (ApoE-/- + simvastatin group). Eight 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were assigned as the control group and fed with a basic diet. After 36 weeks, plasma lipids and inflflammatory factors were measured. Aortic atherosclerotic lesions by microscope, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope were observed. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The level of high sensitivity C-reaction protein (Hs-CRP) was detected by the scattering immunoturbidimetric assay. Protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in aorta were tested by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, treatment with RYR significantly decreased the levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein (a), and apolipoprotein B100 in ApoE-/- mice (P<0.01). Compared with the model group, treatment with RYR decreased the levels of Hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α (P<0.01). RYR also reduced the protein levels of NF-κB and MMP-9 of the aorta. CONCLUSIONS: RYR has the anti-atherosclerotic and stabilizing unstable plaque effects. The mechanism might be related to the inflflammatory signaling pathways.",

This state-of-the-science review seeks to explore the most recent evidence on the effectiveness and safety of RYR supplementation in treating dyslipidemic adults. METHODS: This review extends the time frame of a meta-analysis performed by Li and colleagues in 2014; specifically, we looked at the literature published between September 2013 and April 2016. We conducted a search of four electronic databases-PsycINFO, CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus-using the terms red yeast rice and cholesterol. We excluded studies that included berberine or lovastatin. RESULTS: Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Eleven articles reported on randomized controlled trials, one reported on an open-label pilot study, and one reported on an open-label clinical trial. Two articles were meta-analyses. The 13 studies involved a total of 1,246 participants, with an additional 7,467 participants reported in the two meta-analyses. Significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol levels with RYR supplementation were observed in all trials. There were no significant changes in liver and kidney function, and 10 studies noted no significant changes in creatine kinase levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although RYR appears to be a safe and effective lipid-lowering agent, there is insufficient evidence to support the recommendation of RYR supplementation to patients. Further research is needed, including long-term studies, studies that include participants with comorbidities and complex medical histories, and studies that take into account the variability of formulation and dosage of RYR in the marketplace.",

The aim of the study is to test the efficacy of the nutraceutical formulation (one daily) in lowering non-HDL cholesterol vs. placebo at 12 weeks in individuals with non-HDL-cholesterol levels ≥160 mg/dL. 39 subjects (age 52 ± 11 years; 54% females; body mass index 27 ± 4 kg/m²) were randomized (3:1) in a double blind phase II placebo-controlled study. At baseline, 4 and 12 weeks main clinical/biohumoral parameters, pro-inflammatory cytokines, (gut)-hormones, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels and endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) number were assessed. Baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. The intervention significantly decreased non-HDL cholesterol (-30 ± 20 mg/dL; p = 0.012), LDL cholesterol (-31 ± 18 mg/dL, p = 0.011) and apolipoprotein (Apo) B (-14 ± 12 mg/dL, p = 0.030) levels compared to the placebo. Pro-inflammatory, hormonal, PCSK9 and EPC levels remained stable throughout the study in both groups. The intervention was well tolerated. Three adverse events occurred: Epstein Barr virus infection, duodenitis and asymptomatic but significant increase in creatine phosphokinase (following intense physical exercise) which required hospitalization.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) refers to clustered cardiovascular risk factors (abdominal obesity, pre-diabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia). Therapies targeting oxidative stress may delay progression to atherosclerosis and diabetes. We investigated the anti-oxidative effect of a supplement combining red yeast rice and olive extract in patients with MetS. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial was conducted with 50 patients with MetS as defined by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Forty-nine subjects randomly assigned to red yeast rice-olive extract (RYR-olive extract; 10.82 mg of monacolins and 9.32 mg of hydroxytyrosol per Cholesfytolplus capsule) or placebo completed the 8-week trial. Whereas effects on cardiovascular risk parameters of MetS have been reported recently, the observed significant 20% increase in oxidised low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) prompted us to investigate other oxidative stress-related parameters: malondialdehyde (MDA), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Statistical calculations included univariate quantitative analysis, multivariate linear regression and correlation analysis. RESULTS: The updated results indicate that an RYR-olive extract supplement significantly reduced Lp-PLA2 by 7% (p < 0.001), but it failed to show a significant decrease in plasma MDA and 8-OHdG (p > 0.05). Reductions in OxLDL (20%) and Lp-PLA2 (7%) were associated with each other (r = 0.740, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RYR-olive extract significantly reduced Lp-PLA2 in correlation with the marked reduction in plasma OxLDL, which may lead to a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with MetS.

      "abstract": "Red yeast rice, a commercially available food supplement known to reduce serum cholesterol, has been repeatedly advocated as alternative therapy for hypercholesterolemic patients that refuse statins, cannot tolerate statin therapy's side effects, or request a \"naturopathic\" medicine. Red yeast rice contains a fungus (Monascus purpureus), which was utilized in the original production of lovastatin (MEVACOR, Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ), the first marketed pharmaceutical statin, and is chemically identical to such product. Their identical properties account for the similarity in therapeutic and side effects of red yeast rice and lovastatin. The red yeast rice ingredient that blocks cholesterol production is monacolin K. Because red yeast rice preparations have large variability in monacolin K content, predicting or understanding dose-related efficacy and side-effect risks of red yeast rice is practically impossible. The lipid-regulating potency of red yeast rice in commercial preparations was found to be extensively different according to the number or concentration of monacolin K they possess. Furthermore, more than one type of monacolin was found in different preparations (or batches) of red yeast rice. Other ingredients found in red yeast rice are also known to be potentially toxic. The US Food and Drug Administration issued warnings to consumers in 2007 and in 2013 against taking red yeast rice products due to the lack of assurance about its efficacy, safety, and lack of standardized preparation methods. This article discusses my clinical trial results with red yeast rice, reviews the literature on its therapeutic and side effects, and discusses why red yeast rice is not an acceptable substitution for statins.",

There is supporting evidence that the consumption of red yeast rice (RYR; Monascus purpureus-fermented rice) reduces the vascular complications of diabetes; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of RYR extract in PACs, focusing particularly on the role of a potent antioxidative enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). We found that treatment with RYR extract induced nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor nuclear translocation and HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in PACs. RYR extract inhibited high-glucose-induced (30 mM) PAC senescence and the development of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. The HO-1 inducer cobalt protoporphyrin IX also decreased high-glucose-induced cell senescence and oxidative stress, whereas the HO-1 enzyme inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX and HO-1 small interfering RNA significantly reversed RYR extract-caused inhibition of senescence and reduction of oxidative stress in high-glucose-treated PACs. These results suggest that RYR extract serves as alternative and complementary medicine in the treatment of these diseases, by inducing HO-1, thereby decreasing the vascular complications of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Red yeast rice (RYR) is a dietary supplement containing monacolins obtained by fermentation of Monascus purpureus strains. Because of its structural homology with lovastatin, monacolin K inhibits HMG-CoA reductase and shows hypocholesterolemic properties comparable to synthetic statins. We studied all cases of myopathy involving RYR reported in the French national pharmacovigilance database (6 cases) and in scientific literature (9 cases). Among these cases, 9 showed elevated creatine kinase, 3 rhabdomyolysis and 2 myalgia. Recent studies seem to show good efficacy of the RYR, however, our work reports the existence of related muscular disorders. In addition, dietary supplements currently available on the market may show considerable variability of formulation and/or the presence of contaminants. When clinicobiological disorders occur, physicians should consider the eventual use of an herbal treatment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of combining red yeast rice and Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) in lowering cholesterol in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, the later has also been shown to remove cholesterol in in vitro studies. METHODS: A double-blind clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the cholesterol-lowering effect of the combination of red yeast rice and L. casei. Sixty patients with primary hyperlipidemia were recruited and randomized equally to either the treatment group (red yeast rice + L. casei) or the control group (red yeast rice + placebo). One red yeast rice capsule and two L. casei capsules were taken twice a day. The treatment lasted for 8 weeks, with an extended follow-up period of 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was a difference of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at week 8. RESULTS: At week 8, the LDL-C serum level in both groups was lower than that at baseline, with a decrease of 33.85±26.66 mg/dL in the treatment group and 38.11±30.90 mg/dL in the control group; however, there was no statistical difference between the two groups (P>0.05). The total cholesterol was also lower than the baseline in both groups, yet without a statistical difference between the two groups. The only statistically signifificant difference between the two groups was the average diastolic pressure at week 12, which dropped by 2.67 mm Hg in the treatment group and increased by 4.43 mm Hg in the placebo group (P<0.05). The antihypertensive activity may be associated with L. casei. Red yeast rice can signifificantly reduce LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglyceride. CONCLUSION: The combination of red yeast rice and L. casei did not have an additional effect on lipid profifiles.",

      "abstract": "Twenty castrated Boer crossbred goats were used in the present study with two treatments to examine the effect of dietary replacement of ordinary rice with red yeast rice on nutrient utilization, enteric methane emission and ruminal archaea structure and composition. Two treatment diets contained (DM basis) 70.0% of forage, 21.8% of concentrates and 8.2% of either ordinary rice (control) or red yeast rice (RYR). Nutrient utilization was measured and enteric methane emissions were determined in respiration chambers. Results showed that RYR had significantly lower digestibility of N and organic matter compared to control group. However, feeding red yeast rice did not affect N retention as g/d or a proportion of N intake, and reduced heat production as MJ/d or as a proportion of metabolizable energy intake, thus leading to a higher proportion of metabolizable energy intake to be retained in body tissue. RYR also had significantly lower methane emissions either as g/d, or as a proportion of feed intake. Although feeding red yeast rice had no negative effect on any rumen fermentation variables, it decreased serum contents of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. In the present study, 75616 archaeal sequences were generated and clustered into 2364 Operational Taxonomic Units. At the genus level, the predominant archaea in the rumen of goats was Methanobrevibacter, which was significantly inhibited with the supplementation of red yeast rice. In conclusion, red yeast rice is a potential feed ingredient for mitigation of enteric methane emissions of goats. However, caution should be taken when it is used because it may inhibit the digestibility of some nutrients. Further studies are required to evaluate its potential with different diets and animal species, as well as its effects on animal health and food safety.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Evidence suggests prolonged exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), starting at a younger age, substantially lowers cardiovascular (CV) risk. Accordingly, the CV pandemic affecting younger population in low- to low-middle-income countries, where statin usage is poor even in secondary prevention, may benefit from lipid-lowering nutritional products, as nutritional intervention is generally preferred in these cultures. However, the safety and efficacy of such preparations have not been systematically tested. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind study, 191 statin-free subjects with newly-diagnosed hyperlipidemia (LDL-C >120 mg/dL, 3.11 mmol/L) and no evidence of CV disease were randomized to one capsule of a proprietary bioactive phytonutrient formulation containing red yeast rice, grape-seed, niacinamide, and folic acid (RYR-NS) or matched placebo twice daily, along with lifestyle modification, for 12 wk. RESULTS: Mean baseline LDL-C levels were 148.5 ± 24.0 mg/dL (3.85 ± 0.62 mmol/L) and 148.6 ± 21.9 mg/dL (3.85 ± 0.57 mmol/L) in the RYR-NS and placebo groups respectively. Compared with placebo, RYR-NS resulted in a significant reduction in LDL-C (-29.4% versus -3.5%, P < 0.0001) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C; -29.8% versus -10.3%, P < 0.0001) at 12 wk. With RYR-NS, 43.4% individuals attained desirable LDL-C levels and 55.4% desirable non-HDL-C levels by week 12, compared to only 0% and 1.1%, respectively, at baseline. No safety issues were observed. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of RYR-NS in lowering LDL-C and non-HDL-C after 12 wk, with magnitude of LDL-C reduction being comparable to that seen with moderate-intensity statin therapy. Further long-term studies are required to determine the impact of RYR-NS on treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.",

At each study step, a complete lipid pattern, safety parameters, hs-CRP, and endothelial function have been measured. When compared to the placebo phase, during monacolin treatment, patients experienced a more favorable percentage change in total cholesterol (TC) (TC after monacolin treatment, -18.35%; TC after placebo treatment, -5.39%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (LDL after monacolin treatment, -22.36%; LDL after placebo treatment, -1.38%), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (non-HDL after monacolin treatment, -22.83%; non-HDL after placebo treatment: -7.15%), hs-CRP (hs-CRP after monacolin treatment: -2.33%; hs-CRP after placebo treatment, 2.11%), and endothelial function (pulse volume displacement after monacolin treatment, 18.59%; pulse volume displacement after placebo treatment, -6.69%).

However 10% to 15% of patients are intolerant to any statin drugs, even at low daily doses and almost one-third of statin users discontinue therapy within 1 year. Some nutraceuticals are prescribed as lipid-lowering substances, but doubts remain about their efficacy and tolerability. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the efficacy and the safety of a nutraceutical combination consisting mainly of 200 mg red yeast rice extract (equivalent to 3 mg monacolins), 500 mg berberine, and 10 mg policosanols (MBP-NC) in patients with low-moderate risk hypercholesterolemia. METHODS: In this single centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 60 consecutive outpatients (29 men and 31 women; age range = 18-60 years), with newly diagnosed primary hypercholesterolemia not previously treated, after a run-in period of 3 weeks on a stable hypolipidic diet, were randomized to receive a pill of MBP-NC (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) once a day after dinner, in addition to the hypolipidic diet. The efficacy and the tolerability of the proposed nutraceutical treatment were fully assessed after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: In the MBP-NC group both total cholesterol and LDL-C already showed a significant reduction at Week 4 (-30.3% ± 33.9% and -29.4% ± 35.3%, respectively) that remained substantially unchanged at Week 12 (-26.7% ± 33.1% and -25.6% ± 31.5%, respectively) and at Week 24 (-24.6% ± 32.1% and -23.7% ± 32.6%, respectively). The between-groups differences were significant at all time points for both total cholesterol and LDL-C. There were no significant changes in HDL-C, fasting glucose, and triglyceride serum levels in either group. MBP-NC was also safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with low- to moderate-risk hypercholesterolemia a nutraceutical combination in association with a hypolipidic diet significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL-C levels and may favor the reaching the recommended cholesterol targets.

Monacolin K, an extract of red yeast rice (RYR, Hongqu), plays important roles in the management of dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, and diabetes. Our study aimed to investigate the protective effect of monacolin K on ovariectomy-induced bone loss in rats. Fifty female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham-operated and five ovariectomized (OVX) groups: OVX with vehicle, OVX with fluvastatin, and OVX with RYR extract of three graded doses. Bone mineral density (BMD), biochemical markers, and cell viability were analyzed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification and western blot. Our results showed that administration of RYR extract markedly increased the bone mineral density in OVX rats. Moreover, RYR extract decreased the levels of bone turnover markers, including osteocalcin and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase activity. The MMT assay revealed that RYR extract treatment significantly improved the osteoblast viabilities in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). At the molecular level, we further demonstrated that RYR extract enhanced the expression of Bmp2 and Bmp4 both at the mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, these data suggested RYR extract could protect against osteoporosis in ovariectomized rats, most likely through activation of BMP2/4 expression.",

      "abstract": "Lovastatin, the progenitor of the statin family, is in fact a naturally occurring compound produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus. Red yeast rice (RYR), a traditional Chinese food made by fermenting rice with M purpureus, is an herbal medicine that has been used for 1200 y as a therapy for problems related to circulation and digestion. RYR contains a range of compounds known as monacolins, of which monacolin K-renamed lovastatin by pharmaceutical researchers-was found to be the most potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. Standardized extracts of RYR, providing 10 mg of monacolins daily, have been shown to lower elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by approximately 20%. In a large secondary prevention trial in China, RYR was found to be markedly protective with respect to cardiovascular events and total mortality. Yet RYR very rarely induces the myopathy and hepatic damage commonly seen with prescription statin therapy. The Chinese herbal compound berberine, used to treat diabetes and congestive heart failure in China, has been shown to increase hepatic expression of LDL receptors and, hence, to lower LDL cholesterol, by extending the half-life of LDL receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). This effect is complementary to the increased transcription of this mRNA promoted by statin therapy. Because berberine is well tolerated aside from transient gastrointestinal (GI) upset in some people and, in particular, has not been reported to cause myopathy or hepatic damage, the combination of RYR and berberine may have the potential to achieve reductions in LDL cholesterol comparable with those achieved with prescription statin therapy, but without the associated risks such as muscle damage and diabetes. Moreover, berberine, via its ability to activate adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK), which it shares with the drug metformin, can lower triglycerides, improve metabolic syndrome, aid glycemic control in diabetics, and act directly on the vasculature to promote vascular health. It may also have the potential to reduce risk for various cancers, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, although such predictions are highly speculative. Whereas statin therapy modestly increases risk for type 2 diabetes, berberine likely has the opposite effect. These considerations suggest that combined administration of RYR and berberine may provide a broader range of health protection than is afforded by prescription statin therapy, with lower risks for serious adverse effects compared with statins. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of optimal intakes of RYR and berberine on serum lipids and other vascular risk factors are needed.",

This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of RYR on blood pressure (BP), lipid profile, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in treating hypertension. Seven electronic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and the Wanfang database were searched. To investigate the role of RYR for hypertension, randomized controlled trials for the use of RYR either as monotherapy or in combination with conventional medicine versus placebo, no intervention, or conventional medicine for hypertension were identified. A total of 21 trials containing 4558 patients were analyzed, the majority of which had low methodological quality. \"RYR plus conventional therapy\" exhibited significant lowering effects on serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and CRP but exhibited no significant effect on systolic BP, diastolic BP, triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with \"placebo plus conventional therapy.\" \"RYR plus conventional therapy\" showed significant lowering effects on systolic BP, TC, LDL-C, and CRP but no effect on diastolic BP, TG, and HDL-C compared with \"placebo plus conventional therapy.\" No significant difference in BP and lipid profile between \"RYR plus conventional therapy\" and \"statins plus conventional therapy\" was observed. \"RYR plus statins\" appeared to be more effective in lowering BP, TC, TG, and LDL-C but without a significant difference in HDL-C compared to statins. No serious adverse events were reported. The results of this meta-analysis suggested some supportive but limited evidence regarding RYR for hypertension. Further rigorously designed trials are warranted before RYR could be recommended to hypertensive patients.",

Previous studies have shown red yeast rice (RYR) effectiveness in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of RYR on obesity and hyperlipidemia. Mice were randomly separated into five groups: the control group with a normal diet, the high-fat diet (HFD) group fed a HFD without any treatment, and HFD-fed groups supplemented with RYR (1 g/kg/day for 8 weeks, 1 g/kg/day for 12 weeks, and 2.5 g/kg/day for 8 weeks). Body weight was recorded twice and food intake thrice weekly. Liver and fat pads were surgically removed and weighed. The levels of lipid parameters, liver enzymes, and leptin levels were measured. The HFD feeding resulted in obesity, which was associated with increases in body weight, liver weight, fat pad weight, liver enzymes, and plasma leptin levels with the development of hyperlipidemia. RYR prevented weight gain and fat pad weight in mice fed a HFD. RYR alleviated blood lipid parameters, liver enzymes, and leptin levels, and improved atherogenic index. These findings suggest that RYR has therapeutic potential in treating obesity and hyperlipidemia.",

METHODS: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Medline and EMBASE were searched until November 2014. We selected randomized studies in which RYR with a known content of the active substance monacolin K was tested against placebo or an active control group. Outcome measures were the effect of RYR on LDL cholesterol and incidence of adverse reactions with emphasis on liver and kidney injury and muscle symptoms. RESULTS: Twenty studies were analyzed. Quality of safety assessment was low in the majority of studies. RYR lowered LDL cholesterol with 1.02 mmol/L [-1.20; -0.83] compared to placebo. Effect of RYR on LDL was not different from statin therapy (0.03 mmol/L [-0.36; 0.41]). The incidence of liver and kidney injury was 0-5% and the risk was not different between treatment and control groups (risk difference -0.01 [-0.01; 0.0] and 0.0 [-0.01; 0.02]). CONCLUSIONS: RYR exerts a clinically and statistically significant reduction of 1.02 mmol/L LDL cholesterol. Only when the mild profile of adverse reactions can be affirmed in studies with adequate methodology for safety assessment, RYR might be a safe and effective treatment option for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk reduction in statin intolerant patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises a spectrum of clinical phenotypes in which dyslipidemia, dysglycemia and hypertension are clustered and where all share a high level of oxidative stress and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This study examines the effect of a nutritional supplement combining red yeast rice and olive fruit extract on the lipid profile and on oxidative stress in a population of patients with MetS. METHODS: In a double blind placebo controlled randomized trial, 50 persons with MetS, as defined by the ATPIII criteria, received the study product or placebo for 8 weeks. The study product contained 10.82 mg of monacolins and 9,32 mg of hydroxytyrosol per capsule, and is commercialized as Cholesfytol plus. The primary outcome measure was the difference in LDL reduction between intervention and control groups. Furthermore, differences in changes of CH, HDL, ApoA1, ApoB, HbA1c and oxLDL were measured, as well as side-effects, CK elevation, changes in clinical parameters and in cardiovascular risk. RESULTS: In the intervention group, LDL cholesterol was lowered by 24% whereas it increased by 1% in the control group (p < 0.001). Other effects observed were a change in total cholesterol (-17% in the intervention group vs +2% in the control group, p < 0.001), apolipoprotein B (-15% vs +6%, p < 0.001), and TG (-9% vs + 16%, p = 0.02). Oxidized LDL decreased by 20% vs an increase of 5% in the control group (p < 0.001). Systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure decreased significantly by 10 mmHg (vs 0% in the control group, p = 0.001) and 7 mmHg (vs 0% in the control group, p = 0.05) respectively. One person in the intervention group, who suffered from Segawa's syndrome, dropped out because of severe muscle ache. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of active products in this study may be an alternative approach to statins in people who do not need, or cannot or do not want to be treated with chemical statins. Side effects, effects on oxidative stress and on glucose metabolism need to be examined more thoroughly. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02065180 (February 2014).",

The Chinese have used RYR to flavor, color, and preserve foods and as a traditional medicine for many years. In the USA, RYR has been used as an alternative to statin therapy in treating patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia. RYR contains a variety of monacolins, which inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. Consumption of RYR has increased recently especially among patients who might be intolerant to standardized therapy due to statin-associated myalgia (SAM). Several clinical trials have shown RYR to be safe, effective, and well tolerated; however, the studies are small and of short duration. The US Food and Drug Administration has prohibited the sale of all RYR products containing monacolin K, which is chemically identical to lovastatin, because it is considered an unapproved drug. However, many RYR supplements continue to remain on the market and lack standardization and quality control.",

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of XZK on the kidneys and investigate the related mechanisms in a rat model of hyperlipidemia. Thus, the effect on inflammatory transcription factors and kidney damage was investigated with in vitro and in vivo experiments on hyperlipidemic rats following XZK treatment. The results revealed that the plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly decreased, while the levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were significantly upregulated in the XZK treatment group, as compared with those in the hyperlipidemia group (P<0.05). In addition, the results demonstrated that XZK was able to repair the kidney damage caused by hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, the expression levels of the inflammatory transcription factors, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, were shown to be reduced in the XZK group when compared with the hyperlipidemia group. In summary, XZK reduces kidney injury, downregulates the levels of TG, TC and LDL-C, as well as the expression levels of inflammatory transcription factors, and upregulates HDL-C. These results further the understanding of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms underlying hyperlipidemia and aid the development of XZK as an effective therapeutic agent for hyperlipidemia."

It has highly toxic, mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic properties and is often found in crops, vegetables and fruit. To our knowledge there is no specific legislation on maximum levels permitted for citrinin, so no official analytical method is currently available for its determination. Our laboratory developed a fluorometric flow-through optosensor using Sephadex SPC-25 as solid support. Multi-commutated flow injection analysis was used for the construction of the manifold and for handling solutions. In this way, we minimised waste generation and human intervention, which are critical aspects when dealing with highly toxic compounds such as citrinin. The optimum excitation/emission wavelengths were set at 330/494 nm; the calibration curve was linear in the concentration range 35-900 ng ml⁻¹. A detection limit of 10.5 ng ml⁻¹ and relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 3% were obtained. The developed optosensor was applied to the determination of citrinin in rice and dietary supplements containing red yeast rice.",

Absence of monacolin-k, lower level of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), higher content of total amino acids, and antioxidant activities were detected in MARDI fermented red yeast rice water extract (MFRYR). In vivo MFRYR treatment on hypercholesterolemic mice recorded similar lipid lowering effect as commercial red yeast rice extract (CRYR) as it helps to reduce the elevated serum liver enzyme and increased the antioxidant levels in liver. This effect was also associated with the upregulation of apolipoproteins-E and inhibition of Von Willebrand factor expression.

One hundred and thirty-four dislipidemic patients were randomised to take placebo or a patented nutraceutical association in tablet form (Zeta ColestRT), 1 tablet /day (immediately after the dinner), for three months in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. At baseline and after 3 months the following were evaluated: body weight, body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profile, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), metalloprotineases-2 and -9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The nutraceutical combination decreased total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol compared to baseline (p = 0.042, and p = 0.041, respectively) and to placebo (p = 0.039, and p = 0.037, respectively). Triglycerides were reduced by the active treatment (p = 0.039), but not by placebo, even if, in group to group comparison, no differences were recorded (p = 0.061).

This study examines the efficacy and safety of red yeast rice (RYR), a source of natural statins, as compared with atorvastatin, which is the most widely used synthetic statin. Statin interference with the endogenous synthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) prompted the hypothesis that its deficiency may be implicated in the pathogenesis of statin-associated myopathy. Hence, the effects of combination of CoQ10 with either statin have been evaluated. Rats were rendered hyperlipidemic through feeding them a high-fat diet for 90 days, during the last 30 days of the diet they were treated daily with either atorvastatin, RYR, CoQ10, or combined regimens. Lipid profile, liver function tests, and creatine kinase were monitored after 15 and 30 days of drug treatments. Heart contents of CoQ9 and CoQ10 were assessed and histopathological examination of the liver and aortic wall was performed. RYR and CoQ10 had the advantage over atorvastatin in that they lower cholesterol without elevating creatine kinase, a hallmark of myopathy. RYR maintained normal levels of heart ubiquinones, which are essential components for energy production in muscles. In conclusion, RYR and CoQ10 may offer alternatives to overcome atorvastatin-associated myopathy.",

      "abstract": "Despite a recent health claim by the European Agency on Food Safety, the effect of high doses of dietary monacolin supplements from red yeast rice on cholesterolemia has not been tested in Italian subjects. Our aim via a crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was to test if a short-term treatment with 10 mg monacolins could improve lipid pattern, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and vascular remodeling biomarkers in a small cohort of Mediterranean subjects. Thus, 25 healthy, mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects were enrolled, and after 4 weeks of a stabilization diet, subjects were randomized to the sequence placebo-washout-monacolins or monacolins-washout-placebo, with each period being 4 weeks long. At each study step, a complete lipid pattern, safety parameters, hs-CRP, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 levels were measured. When compared to the placebo group, monacolins-treated patients experienced a more favorable percent change in total cholesterol (-12.45%, 95% CI -16.19 to -8.71), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-21.99%, 95% CI -26.63 to -17.36), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-14.67%, 95% CI -19.22 to -10.11), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (-28.05%, 95% CI -35.18 to -20.93), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (-27.19%, 95% CI -36.21 to -18.15), and hs-CRP (-23.77%, 95% CI -30.54 to -17.01). No significant differences were observed in regards to triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and safety parameters. On the basis of our data, we demonstrate that a 10-mg monacolin nutraceutical appears to safely reduce cholesterolemia, hs-CRP, and markers of vascular remodeling in Italian subjects. These results have to be confirmed in larger patient samples and longer studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, red yeast rice (RYR) supplements have been marketed aggressively as a natural way to lower cholesterol; however, the large majority of commercially available products have not been studied according to current research standards. METHODS: In a double blind placebo controlled randomized trial, 52 physicians and their spouses with a total cholesterol level of > 200 mg/dL were randomly allocated to receive a RYR extract or placebo for 8 weeks. As a primary outcome measure, we compared the before-after difference in lipid levels between both groups. As secondary outcome measures we looked at side-effects, CK elevation and a change in cardiovascular risk. RESULTS: LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol was lowered with 36 mg/dL (22%) and total cholesterol with 37 mg/dL (15%) in the intervention group. This result was statistically significant as compared to the control group, in which no reduction in total cholesterol and LDL was observed (p < 0.001). There was no marked difference in CK (creatine kinase)-elevation or reported side-effects between study groups. In 5/31 participants in the intervention group, the lipid lowering effect resulted in lower cardiovascular risk as measured with SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation). CONCLUSIONS: The RYR formulation under study was effective in lowering cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in this study population. RYR therapy may be an attractive and relatively well studied alternative in patients who are intolerant for statins or who have objections against pharmacological lipid lowering. However, consumers need to be warned that the actual content of commercially available preparations is not assured by governmental regulations, which raises effectiveness and safety issues.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the lipid-lowering effects of phytosterol tablets and lifestyle change (LC) on top of red yeast rice (RYR) therapy in patients with a history of statin refusal or statin-associated myalgias. DESIGN: A total of 187 participants (mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], 154 mg/dL) took RYR 1800 mg twice daily and were randomized to phytosterol tablets 900 mg twice daily or placebo. Participants were also randomized to a 12-week LC program or usual care (UC). Primary end point was change in LDL-C at 12, 24, and 52 weeks. Secondary end points were effect on other lipoproteins, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, weight, and development of myalgia. RESULTS: Phytosterols did not significantly improve LDL-C at weeks 12 (P = .54), 24 (P = .67), or 52 (P = .76) compared with placebo. Compared with the UC group, the LC group had greater reductions in LDL-C at weeks 12 (-51 vs -42 mg/dL, P = .006) and 24 (-48 vs -40 mg/dL, P = .034) and was 2.3 times more likely to achieve an LDL-C <100 mg/dL (P = .004). The LC group lost more weight for 1 year (-2.3 vs -0.3 kg, P < .001). All participants took RYR and had significant decreases in LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol for 1 year when compared with baseline (P < .001). Four participants stopped supplements because of myalgia. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of phytosterol tablets to RYR did not result in further lowering of LDL-C levels. Participants in an LC program lost significantly more weight and were more likely to achieve an LDL-C <100 mg/dL compared with UC.",

All randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with Xuezhikang as a treatment for CHD combined with dyslipidemia were considered for inclusion. Data extraction and analyses and quality assessment were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. Results. We included 22 randomized trials. Xuezhikang showed significant benefit on the incidence of all-cause deaths, CHD deaths, myocardial infarction, and revascularization as compared with placebo based on conventional treatment for CHD. It remarkably lowered total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) as compared with the placebo or inositol nicotinate group, which was similar to statins group. Xuezhikang also raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared to placebo or no intervention, which was similar to Inositol nicotinate and slightly inferior to statins. The incidence of adverse events did not differ between the Xuezhikang and control group. Conclusions. Xuezhikang showed a comprehensive lipid-regulating effect and was safe and effective in reducing cardiovascular events in CHD patients complicated by dyslipidemia. However, more rigorous trials with high quality are needed to give high level of evidence."

      "abstract": "Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is estimated that 42% of females and 34% of males in the USA have elevated total cholesterol. The current mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy utilizes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (i.e., statin) medications that lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by an average of 20% and 28%, respectively. However, due to the significant side effects of statin medications, many patients seek alternative therapies to help manage their hypercholesterolemia. Red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) has been used as a food and as an herbal medication in China for centuries. Phytosterols are foods that are similar in structure and function to animal cholesterol. Both of these compounds have been shown in clinical studies to significantly lower LDL cholesterol. We report on a case series of 18 patients with hypercholesterolemia despite therapeutic lifestyle change through diet and exercise who took a proprietary product combining red yeast rice and phytosterols as a powdered shake in an effort to improve their cholesterol indices. Statistically significant reduction (p < .05) in the following mean variables was seen: total cholesterol 19% (46 mg/dL) and LDL 33% (53 mg/dL) after 6 weeks using the blend. There was no significant difference in body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, or systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the same period. This magnitude of reduction in LDL cholesterol is significantly greater than the 28% reduction observed in the 1999 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) meta-analysis on the average effectiveness of statin medications in lowering cholesterol levels. None of the participants in our study reported any muscle pains, and no abnormal liver function tests were seen while taking the product. Though this case series is limited by small sample size, study duration, and lack of control group, the product's significant reduction in LDL cholesterol without severe side effects indicates that this product may be a clinically effective and well tolerated alternative treatment to using statin medications to treat hypercholesterolemia.",
