      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response with Conventional Behaviour Guidance techniques on the reduction of dental anxiety in children aged 7-11 years during the administration of local anaesthesia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This parallel, randomised controlled trial involved 78 children requiring invasive dental treatment under local anaesthetic block, who were allocated into three groups: Progressive Muscle Relaxation, Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, and Conventional Behaviour Guidance techniques. The primary outcome was reduction of dental anxiety, as measured by objective (pulse rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure) and subjective (Visual Facial Anxiety Scale) parameters before, after intervention and during local anaesthesia by a blinded outcome assessor. RESULTS: Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response demonstrated a significant reduction in blood pressure during local anaesthesia (p = 0.009 and 0.042, respectively). Progressive Muscle Relaxation significantly reduced mean Visual Facial Anxiety scores after intervention (p < 0.001), whilst Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response significantly reduced these scores during injection (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The use of Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response resulted in a reduction in dental anxiety and can be used as adjuncts to basic behaviour guidance techniques. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI Reg no.: CTRI/2022/09/045796, Dated 23 September 2022)."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To date, the feasibility of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) as a complement to traditional treatments for patients with depression remains unclear. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of breathing-relaxation training plus ASMR on mood and depressive symptoms in patients with mild depression. METHODS: A quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design with a non-equivalent control group was used. Forty patients with mild depression were assigned to the experimental group that received breathing-relaxation training plus ASMR or the wait-list control group for a total of 8 training sessions. To assess mood and depressive symptoms, the Korean version of the Profile of Mood State-Brief and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were performed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in baseline demographic characteristics between both groups. After the 8 training sessions, the experimental group achieved a significantly greater improvement in mood and depressive symptoms with more ASMR experiences compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: These findings illustrated the feasibility of ASMR as a complementary tool and breathing-relaxation training plus ASMR might be clinically beneficial to alleviate negative mood and depressive symptoms in patients with mild depression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a sensory response such as tingling and pleasantness from audiovisual stimuli. ASMR videos come in a wide variety of types, and personal preferences are biased. There are many reports of the effects os ASMR on sleep onset, anxiety relief, and other relaxation effects. However, prior task-oriented studies have used ASMR videos provided by the experimenter. We hypothesized that ASMR movies of a personal preference would show significantly increased activity in the nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, and insular cortex, which are brain areas associated with relaxation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the neuroscientific basis for the relaxation effects of ASMR videos that match someone's personal preferences. METHODS: This study included 30 healthy individuals aged ≥18 years. ASMR enthusiasts were included as the target population due to the need to have a clear preference for ASMR videos. A control video (1 type) and ASMR videos (20 types) were used as the stimulus tasks. Among the ASMR videos, those with high and low evaluation scores were considered liked and dislikedASMR videos, respectively. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed while the participants viewed a block design with a resting task in between. The data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 to identify the areas activated by control, disliked, and liked ASMR videos. RESULTS: Emotion-related areas (the amygdala, frontal cortex, and insular cortex) not activated by control and unliked ASMR videos were activated only by liked ASMR videos. CONCLUSION: The amygdala, frontal cortex, and insular cortex may be involved in the limbic dopamine circuits of the amygdala and middle frontal gyrus and the autonomic balance of the left and right insular cortices. This suggests the potential of positive mood and its use as a treatment for patients with anxiety and depression. These results suggest that the use of ASMR videos to match individual preferences may induce relaxation and have beneficial effects on depression and other disorders, and also support the introduction of ASMR videos in mental health care."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the effects of Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) and binaural beat (BB) on stress reduction, and to determine whether ASMR and BB can induce changes in quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). A double-blind randomized trial was conducted. Subjects with stress were recruited considering their perceived stress scale (PSS), Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II), insomnia severity index (ISI), and state-trait anxiety inventory-state anxiety (STAI-S) scores. Subjects listened to ASMR or BB with music (8 Hz for daytime, 5 Hz for nighttime) for 15 min in daytime and 30 min before going to sleep for 3 weeks. QEEG was measured before and after the intervention. Seventy-six participants (57 female, mean age = 46.12 ± 12.01) finished the trial. After the intervention, PSS, BDI-II, ISI, STAI-S, and PSQI scores improved significantly in both groups. BDI-II and ISI mean scores were normalized in both groups after the intervention. Changes of absolute beta and high beta power in the ASMR group were larger than those in the BB group (p = 0.026, p = 0.040, respectively). Both ASMR and BB are equally effective in reducing stress levels. Unlike BB, ASMR can lead to an increase in beta and high beta waves associated with cortical arousal.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) on the psychological cravings and anxiety of women compulsorily isolated for detoxification. METHOD: Around 122 women were recruited in a female drug detoxification center. Except for the 12-week training of ASMR, the experimental conditions of the experimental group (n = 60) were the same as those of the control group (n = 62). The addiction Stroop task was used to assess the level of psychological cravings and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to assess the level of anxiety. RESULTS: After the training, the decrease in state anxiety of the experimental group was larger than that of the control group, and the reaction time of the experimental group in the Stroop was also significantly lower than before the training. CONCLUSIONS: ASMR could thus reduce to a certain extent the state anxiety and attentional bias for drug-related clues under signaling psychological cravings among women compulsorily isolated for detoxification. HIGHLIGHTS: Intervention effects on psychological cravings and anxiety of women isolated for detoxification Basis for role of ASMR in regulating psychological cravings and anxiety in forced abstainers ASMR intervention reduced forced abstainers' attentional bias to drug-related clues.",

      "abstract": "The Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is an intensely pleasant tingling sensation originating in the scalp and neck and is elicited by a range of online video-induced triggers. Many individuals now regularly watch ASMR videos to relax, and alleviate symptoms of stress and insomnia, all which are indicative of elevated levels of anxiety. Emerging literature suggests that ASMR-capable individuals are characterised by high trait neuroticism, which is associated with a tendency to experience negative emotional states such as anxiety. To date however no literature has empirically linked these personality constructs and watching ASMR videos on the effect of reducing anxiety. In the current study, 36 ASMR-experiencers and 28 non-experiencers watched an ASMR video, and completed assessments of neuroticism, trait anxiety, and pre- / post-video state anxiety. MANCOVA with Group as the independent measures factor showed that ASMR-experiencers had significantly greater scores for neuroticism, trait anxiety, and video engagement than non-experiencers. Pre-video state anxiety was also significantly greater in the ASMR-experiencers and was significantly attenuated on exposure to the ASMR video, whereas non-experiencers reported no difference in state anxiety pre- and post-video. Thus, watching ASMR alleviated state anxiety but only in those who experienced ASMR. Subsequent mediation analyses identified the importance of pre-existing group differences in neuroticism, trait and (pre-video) state anxiety in accounting for the group difference in the reduction of state anxiety. The mediation analysis further lends support for watching ASMR videos as an intervention for the reduction of acute state anxiety. Future areas for research are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a special perceptual phenomenon in which some people can experience a tingling, static-like sensation in response to some certain auditory/visual stimulations. This study compared the performance of executive function (working memory, set shifting, and inhibitory control) between ASMR participants and control participants after three auditory treatment conditions, i.e., ASMR-triggering audio (Triggering), normal-speaking audio (Normal), and with no auditory treatment (Baseline). The results showed that the ASMR individuals did not differ in executive function with the control participants in either Normal or Baseline condition. However, the set shifting and inhibitory control of ASMR individuals slowed down after ASMR-triggering auditory treatment. In this study, ASMR individuals with ASMR-triggering auditory treatment reported that they all experienced three ASMR episodes before completing executive function tasks. These findings indicated that there was no intrinsic difference in executive function between ASMR and control individuals. But ASMR individuals' executive function would be interfered when the ASMR was triggered.",
