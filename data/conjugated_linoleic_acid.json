      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of linseed oil (LO) supplementation on conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) biosynthesis in lactating Saanen goats. Goats (DIM = 96 ± 14 days) were divided into control (n = 6) and LO treatment (n = 6) groups. LO supplementation was implemented in both short- and long-term experimental settings. Short-term LO supplementation significantly increased trans-11 vaccenic acid and cis-9,trans-11 CLA in milk fat without affecting lactation performance. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we identified six upregulated proteins in milk somatic cells, including translocon-associated protein (SSRD), succinyl-CoA ligase (SUCB2), ATP synthase subunit (ATPD), stress-70 protein (GRP75), NADH dehydrogenase (NDUFS2), and cytochrome complex QCR1. Long-term LO supplementation enhanced milk fat content and cis-9,trans-11 CLA levels, while significantly elevating the mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and all previously identified proteins-including proteasome 20s subunit alpha 5 (PSMA5). These findings extend beyond the known SCD pathway, revealing novel protein markers and potential mechanisms associated with CLA biosynthesis in mammary tissue and milk somatic cells.",

The BMECs were treated with different concentrations of H2O2 for 8 h, 600 µmol/L was determined to be the damage concentration. Using different concentrations of c9, t11-CLA to process BMECs for 24 h, 50 and 100 µmol/L were determined to be the effective concentrations for subsequent analyses. Thus, four BMEC groups were established: Control group; H2O2 group; 50 µmol/L c9, t11-CLA + H2O2 group; 100 µmol/L c9, t11-CLA + H2O2 group. We observed that the H2O2 group exhibited significantly lower total antioxidant activity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and significantly higher secretions of malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 than the control group (p < 0.05). Pretreatment with c9, t11-CLA enhanced SOD, CAT, and GPx activities and SOD mRNA expression and repressed IL-6 and IL-8 secretion and expression in H2O2-treated BMECs (p < 0.05). In conclusion, c9, t11-CLA treatment efficiently enhanced antioxidant capacity and decreased inflammation induced by H2O2 in BMECs.",

      "abstract": "Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers exhibit anti-inflammatory properties within the central nervous system (CNS). This study investigated the effects of CLA isomers c9,t11 and t10,c12 on fatty acid (FA) and N-acylethanolamine (NAE) profiles and their association with pro-inflammatory molecule expression in BV-2 microglia cell line, the CNS's resident immune cells responsible for maintaining neuronal activity and immune homeostasis. BV-2 cells were treated with 25 μM of c9,t11-CLA, t10,c12-CLA, or oleic acid (OA) for 24 h, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. After treatment, the cell's FA and NAE profiles and pro-inflammatory molecule expression were analyzed. Our results demonstrated that CLA isomers mitigate LPS-induced morphological changes in BV-2 cells and reduce gene expression and protein levels of inflammatory markers. This effect was linked to an upregulation of acyl-CoA oxidase 1, a key enzyme in the anti-inflammatory peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway that efficiently metabolizes CLA isomers. Notably, t10,c12-CLA significantly suppressed stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, impacting monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis. The NAEs profile was remarkably altered by CLA isomers, with a significant release of the anti-neuroinflammatory mediator docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived N-acylethanolamine (DHAEA). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of CLA isomers are due to their unique influences on FA metabolism and the modulation of bioactive FA-derived NAEs, highlighting a potential strategy for nutritional intervention in conditions characterized by neuroinflammation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A dietary supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was shown to attenuate inflammation and increase the proportions of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-type macrophages in disease models such as autoimmune encephalitis and arteriosclerosis. Since Tregs and anti-inflammatory (M2-type) macrophages were found to enhance stroke recovery, we hypothesized that CLA-supplementation might improve stroke recovery via immune modulatory effects. METHODS: Functional assessment was performed over 90 days after induction of experimental photothrombotic stroke in wild type mice (n = 37, sham n = 10). Subsequently, immunological characterization of different immunological compartments (n = 16), ex vivo magnetic resonance (MR, n = 12) imaging and immunohistochemical staining (n = 8) was performed. Additionally, we tested the effect of CLA in vitro on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from human stroke patients and healthy controls (n = 12). RESULTS: MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) demonstrated enhanced microstructural reorganization of interhemispheric white matter tracts, dependent on lesion size. Functional recovery over 90 days remained unaffected. Detailed immunological analyses across various compartments revealed no significant long-term immunological alterations due to CLA. However, analyses of human blood samples post-stroke showed reduced levels of pro-inflammatory interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) release by T-lymphocytes following in vitro treatment with CLA. CONCLUSION: We aimed to explore the efficacy of a dietary intervention with minimal known side effects that could be accessible to human stroke patients, regardless of the degree of disability, and without the risks associated with aggressive immunomodulatory therapies. Our main findings include improved microstructural reorganization in small infarcts and a reduced inflammatory response of human T cells in vitro."

In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies have confirmed CLA isomers to possess anti-cancer activity. CLA has demonstrated its potential as an alternative treatment for cancer and also used as an adjuvant to reduce the side effects of existing treatment methods. The mechanism of the anticancer activity of CLA is still not clear; however, it may involve intervention with the cell cycle and modulation of gene expression. A greater potential of CLA for cancer treatment has been supported by more and more clinical trials to evaluate its potential. Some advanced technologies are in progress to overcome the flaws of current methods and enhance the microbial production of CLA. In conclusion, nutritional enrichment as a functional food and direct consumption of CLA may contribute to cancer management."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Previous studies investigating the effectiveness of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation in body weight reduction provided unequivocal results. We hypothesized that psychological factors such as self-efficacy, locus of control or dispositional optimism can affect the success of the intervention. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the psychological factors that modulate the effectiveness of CLA supplementation in overweight or obese women and affect the ability to successfully complete the study. METHODS: In total, 74 subjects were recruited into this three-month randomized trial and divided into intervention and control groups receiving, respectively, capsules containing 3 g 80% CLA per day and capsules containing 3 g of sunflower oil. The following psychological tests were performed before the intervention: Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scale, Acceptance of Illness Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES), Health Behavior Inventory scale and Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). RESULTS: A total of 60 women completed the study and the subjects who dropped out obtained higher scores in the GSES (p = 0.0490) and the LOT-R (p = 0.0087) tests than subjects who completed the trial. Besides, multivariate linear regression demonstrated that the SWLS test (p = 0.0345) results were independent predictors of body weight changes. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, psychological factors like self-efficacy and optimism may be associated with a higher risk of withdrawal from the study, while satisfaction with life may have an impact on the effectiveness of body weight reduction.Clinical trial registration: [https://drks.de/search/en], identifier [DRKS00010462]."

      "abstract": "Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a group of natural isomers of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) linoleic acid, exerting biological effects on cow physiology. This study assessed the impact of the mixture 50:50 (vol:vol) of CLA isomers (cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12) on bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proteome, identifying 1608 quantifiable proteins. A supervised multivariate statistical analysis, sparse variant partial least squares - discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) for paired data identified 407 discriminant proteins (DP), allowing the clustering between the CLA and controls. The ProteINSIDE workflow found that DP with higher abundance in the CLA group included proteins related to innate immune defenses (PLIN2, CD36, C3, C4, and AGP), with antiapoptotic (SERPINF2 and ITIH4) and antioxidant effects (HMOX1). These results demonstrated that CLA modulates the bovine PBMC proteome, supports the antiapoptotic and immunomodulatory effects observed in previous in vitro studies on bovine PBMC, and suggests a cytoprotective role against oxidative stress. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we report for the first time that the mixture 50:50 (vol:vol) of cis-9, trans-11, and trans-10, cis-12-CLA isomers modulates the bovine PBMC proteome. Our results support the immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic effects observed in bovine PBMC in vitro. In addition, the present study proposes a cytoprotective role of CLA mixture against oxidative stress. We suggest a molecular signature of CLA treatment based on combining a multivariate sparse discriminant analysis and a clustering method. This demonstrates the great value of sPLS-DA as an alternative option to identify discriminant proteins with relevant biological significance.",

However, the studies reported inconstant results about the CLA-related effects on lipid profiles. As a result, meta-analysis and systematic review were performed to survey the CLA supplementation-related effect on lipid profile including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG). To identify the relevant research, a systematic comprehensive search was initiated on the medical databases such as Scopus and PubMed/Medline until December 2022. The overall effect size was estimated by weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) in a random effect meta-analysis. In the final quantitative analysis, the meta-analysis considered 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1,476 participants (707 controls and 769 cases). The pooled results demonstrated that CLA supplementation, compared with olive oil, significantly increased serum TG levels (WMD: 0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.1; p = 0.04; I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.91). With regard to TC level, CLA supplementation compared with placebo significantly reduced TC concentrations (WMD: -0.08 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.14 to -0.02; p < 0.001; I2 = 82.4%). Moreover, the non-linear dose-response analysis indicated a decreasing trend of TC serum level from the 15th week of CLA supplementation compared with olive oil (Pnon-linearity = 0.01). The present meta-analysis and systematic review of 35 RCTs showed that the CLA intervention was able to raise the level of TG in comparison to olive oil; however, it can decrease TC level compared with placebo and olive oil."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether adding phytoncide oil (PO) and soybean oil (SBO) to the dairy cow diet could increase milk conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and depress methane (CH4) emissions in Holstein dairy cows. Rumen fermentation was conducted at four levels of SBO (0, 1, 2, and 4%, on DM basis) and two levels of PO (0 and 0.1%, on DM basis) with in vitro experiment. To evaluate blood parameters, fecal microbe population, milk yield and fatty acid compositions, and CH4 production, in vivo experiment was conducted using 38 Holstein dairy cows divided into two groups of control (fed TMR) and treatment (fed TMR with 0.1% PO and 2% SBO as DM basis). In the in vitro study (Experiment 1), PO or SBO did not affect rumen pH. However, SBO tended to decrease ruminal ammonia-N (p = 0.099). Additionally, PO or SBO significantly decreased total gas production (p = 0.041 and p = 0.034, respectively). Both PO and SBO significantly decreased CH4 production (p < 0.05). In addition, PO significantly increased both CLA isomers (c9, t11 and t10, c12 CLA) (p < 0.001). Collectively, 0.1% PO and 2% SBO were selected resulting in most effectively improved CLA and decreased CH4 production. In the in vivo study (Experiment 2), 0.1% PO with 2% SBO (PSO) did not affect complete blood count. However, it decreased blood urea nitrogen and magnesium levels in blood (p = 0.021 and p = 0.01, respectively). PSO treatment decreased pathogenic microbes (p < 0.05). It increased milk yield (p = 0.017) but decreased percentage of milk fat (p = 0.013) and MUN level (p < 0.01). In addition, PSO treatment increased both the concentration of CLA and PUFA in milk fat (p < 0.01). Finally, it decreased CH4 emissions from dairy cows. These results provide compelling evidence that a diet supplemented with PSO can simultaneously increase CLA concentration and decrease CH4 production with no influence on the amount of milk fat (kg/day) in Holstein dairy cows.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is tightly associated with liver dysfunction and injury in dairy cows. Previous studies have shown that cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidative abilities. In this study, the bovine hepatocytes were pretreated with CLA for 6 h, followed by treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for another 6 h to investigate the antioxidative effect of CLA and uncover the underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrated that H2O2 treatment elevated the level of mitophagy, promoted mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage into the cytosol, and activated the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to trigger an inflammatory response in bovine hepatocytes. In addition, the dynamin-related protein 1(DRP1)-mtDNA-STING-NF-κB axis contributed to the H2O2-induced oxidative injury of bovine hepatocytes. CLA could reduce mitophagy and the inflammatory response to attenuate oxidative damage via the DRP1/mtDNA/STING pathway in bovine hepatocytes. These findings offer a theoretical foundation for the hepatoprotective effect of CLA against oxidative injury in dairy cows.",

Herein, we report on the fabrication of a targeted delivery nanosystem for paclitaxel (PTX) functionalized with a short antimatrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) CTT peptide for selective MMP-2 targeting and effective antitumor activity in NSCLC. The fabrication of the targeted nanosystem (CLA-coated PTX-SPIONs@CTT) involved coating of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) via chemisorption, onto which PTX was adsorbed, and subsequent surface functionalization with carboxylic acid groups for conjugation of the CTT peptide. CLA-coated PTX SPIONs@CTT had a mean particle size of 99.4 nm and a PTX loading efficiency of ∼98.5%. The nanosystem exhibited a site-specific in vitro PTX release and a marked antiproliferative action on lung adenocarcinoma cells. The CTT-functionalized nanosystem significantly inhibited MMP-2 secretion by almost 70% from endothelial cells, indicating specific anti-MMP-2 activity. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with subcutaneous injection of the CTT-functionalized nanosystem resulted in 69.7% tumor inhibition rate, and the administration of the nanosystem subcutaneously prolonged the half-life of PTX and circulation time in vivo. As such, CLA-coated PTX-SPIONs@CTT presents with potential for application as a targeted nanomedicine in NSCLC management."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress, hyperactivation of compensatory mechanisms (unfolded protein response, UPR; nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, Nrf2) and the stimulation of maladaptive response (inflammation/apoptosis) are interconnected pathogenic processes occurring during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. The neuroprotective ability of dietary Conjugated linoleic acid (CLAmix) in a mouse model of AlCl3-induced AD was recently described but, the effects of AlCl3 or CLAmix intake on these pathogenic processes are still unknown. The effects of dietary AlCl3 or CLAmix - alone and in combination - were examined in the brain cortex of twenty-eight BalbC mice divided into 4 groups (n = 7 each). The neurotoxic effects of AlCl3 were investigated in animals treated for 5 weeks with 100 mg/kg/day (AL). CLAmix supplementation (600 mg/kg bw/day) for 7 weeks (CLA) was aimed at evaluating its modulatory effects on the Nrf2 pathway while its co-treatment with AlCl3 during the last 5 weeks of CLAmix intake (CLA + AL) was used to investigate its neuroprotective ability. Untreated mice were used as controls. In the CLA group, the NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation in the brain cortex was accompanied by the modulation of the Nrf2 pathway. By contrast, in the AL mice, the significant upregulation of oxidative stress markers, compensatory pathways (UPR/Nrf2), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFα) and the proapoptotic protein Bax levels were found as compared with control. Notably, in CLA + AL mice, the marked decrease of oxidative stress, UPR/Nrf2 markers and proinflammatory cytokines levels were associated with the significant increase of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2. The involvement of NOX in the adaptive response elicited by CLAmix along with its protective effects against the onset of several pathogenic processes triggered by AlCl3, broadens the knowledge of the mechanism underlying the pleiotropic activity of Nrf2 activators and sheds new light on their potential therapeutic use against neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "The skeleton is a living organ that undergoes constant changes, including bone formation and resorption. It is affected by various diseases, such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, and osteomalacia. Nowadays, several methods are applied to protect bone health, including the use of hormonal and non-hormonal medications and supplements. However, certain drugs like glucocorticoids, thiazolidinediones, heparin, anticonvulsants, chemotherapy, and proton pump inhibitors can endanger bone health and cause bone loss. New studies are exploring the use of supplements, such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and glucosamine, with fewer side effects during treatment. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the effects of CLA and glucosamine on bone structure, both direct and indirect. One mechanism that deserves special attention is the regulatory effect of RANKL/RANK/OPG on bone turnover. The RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway is considered a motive for osteoclast maturation and bone resorption. The cytokine system, consisting of the receptor activator of the nuclear factor (NF)-kB ligand (RANKL), its receptor RANK, and its decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG), plays a vital role in bone turnover. Over the past few years, researchers have observed the impact of CLA and glucosamine on the RANKL/RANK/OPG mechanism of bone turnover. However, no comprehensive study has been published on these supplements and their mechanism. To address this gap in knowledge, we have critically reviewed their potential effects. This review aims to assist in developing efficient treatment strategies and focusing future studies on these supplements.",

Here, the authors have explored the influence and underlying mechanisms of NO2-CLA on the proinflammatory reaction of murine macrophages that were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Prevotella intermedia, a putative periodontopathic bacterium. Treatment of LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells with NO2-CLA notably dampened the secretion of iNOS-derived NO, IL-1β and IL-6 as well as their gene expressions and significantly enhanced the markers for M2 macrophage polarization. NO2-CLA promoted the HO-1 expression in cells challenged with LPS, and tin protoporphyrin IX, an HO-1 inhibitor, significantly reversed the NO2-CLA-mediated attenuation of NO secretion, but not IL-1β or IL-6. We found that cells treated with NO2-CLA significantly increased mRNA expression of PPAR-γ compared to control cells, and NO2-CLA significantly reverted the decrease in PPAR-γ mRNA caused by LPS. Nonetheless, antagonists to PPAR-γ were unable to reverse the NO2-CLA-mediated suppression of inflammatory mediators. In addition, NO2-CLA did not alter the p38 and JNK activation elicited by LPS. Both NF-κB reporter activity and IκB-α degradation caused by LPS were notably diminished by NO2-CLA. NO2-CLA was observed to interrupt the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of p50 subunits caused by LPS with no obvious alterations in p65 subunits. Further, NO2-CLA attenuated the phosphorylation of STAT1/3 elicited in response to LPS. We propose that NO2-CLA could be considered as a possible strategy for the therapy of periodontal disease, although additional researches are certainly required to confirm this.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) can improve bone health in animals, yet the effects on humans have not been consistent. Therefore, this parallel randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the effect of CLA supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC) in overweight or obese women. Materials and Methods: The study population included 74 women who were divided into the CLA (n = 37) and control (n = 37) groups. The CLA group received six capsules per day containing approximately 3 g of cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 CLA isomers in a 50:50 ratio. The control group received the same number of placebo capsules that contained sunflower oil. BMC and BMD at total body, lumbar spine (L1-L4), and femoral neck were measured before and after a three-month intervention. Results: The comparison of BMC and BMD for the total body, lumbar spine (L1-L4), and femoral neck before and after the intervention showed no differences between the groups. However, a within-group analysis demonstrated a significant increase in BMC (p = 0.0100) and BMD (p = 0.0397) at lumbar spine (L1-L4) in the CLA group. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences between the CLA and placebo groups in changes in all analysed densitometric parameters. Conclusions: Altogether, three-month CLA supplementation in overweight and obese women did not improve bone health, although the short intervention period could have limited our findings, long-term intervention studies are needed. The study protocol was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register database (ID: DRKS00010462, date of registration: 4 May 2016).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a major global health issue, resulting in significant costs and increased mortality rates. Finding effective treatments for obesity is therefore essential. This study investigated the combined effects of L-Carnitine (LC) and Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) on weight loss and adipose tissue microRNA levels. SUBJECTS /METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats weighing 150-200 g and about 8 weeks old were fed either a normal fat diet (NFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Afterwards, the HFD group was randomly divided into four subgroups: control, LC (200 mg kg-1), CLA (500 mg kg-1), and both (n = 8 in each group). The study lasted for an additional 4 weeks. The animals' weights were recorded regularly, and after 12 weeks, miRNAs were extracted from epididymal adipose tissue and analysed using real-time PCR. The miRNA expression levels of miR-27a and miR-143 were compared between groups using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and one-way ANOVA tests in SPSS software. RESULTS: At the end of the first 8 weeks, the HFD group weighed significantly more than the NFD group. LC significantly decreased weight gain (4.2%) compared to the control group, whereas CLA alone (3.5%) or in combination with LC (3.1%) did not significantly slow weight gain. Real-time PCR results showed that the HFD group had higher miR-143 levels and lower miR-27a levels compared to the NFD group. LC and CLA increased miR-27a expression after 4 weeks, but their combination decreased miR-27a expression. CLA alone reduced miR-143 expression, whereas LC had almost no effect. Their combination also reduced miR-143 expression. CONCLUSION: CLA and LC, which are considered weight loss supplements, can potentially regulate metabolism and cellular pathways. However, their combination did not show a synergistic effect on weight loss, possibly due to the reduction in miR-27a expression. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of combined fat burners on obesity treatment.",

Studies have demonstrated that NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes are essential in cardiac redox biology and are responsible for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NOX2 is linked to left ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI). It was hypothesized that conjugated linoleic acid (cLA) treatment increases NOX-2 levels in heart tissue and disrupts connexins between the myocytes in the ventricle. Data herein demonstrate that cLA treatment significantly decreases survival in a murine model of MI. The observance of cLA-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia's (VT) led to the subsequent investigation of the underlying mechanism in this MI model. Mice were treated with cLA for 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h to determine possible time-dependent changes in NOX and Cx43 signaling pathways in isolated left ventricles (LV) extracted from cardiac tissue. The results suggest that ROS generation, through the stimulation of NOX2 in the LV, triggers a decrease in Cx43 levels, causing dysfunction of the gap junctions following treatment with cLA. This cascade of events may initiate VT and subsequent death during MI. Taken together, individuals at risk of MI should use caution regarding cLA consumption.",

Modifying the amounts and ratios of prostaglandin (PG) F2α and PGE2 can benefit the establishment of pregnancy in cattle. Adding conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) to endometrial and fetal cells culture affects PG synthesis, but its effect on bovine trophoblast cells (CT-1) is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of CLA (a mixture of cis- and trans-9, 11- and -10,12-octadecadienoic acids) on PGE2 and PGF2α synthesis and the expression of transcripts involved with maternal-fetal recognition of bovine trophectoderm. Cultures of CT-1 were exposed to CLA for 24, 48 and 72 h. Transcript abundance was determined by qRT-PCR and hormone profiles were quantified by ELISA. The PGE2 and PGF2α concentrations were reduced in the culture medium of CLA-exposed CT-1 compared to that of unexposed cells. Furthermore, CLA supplementation increased the PGE2:PGF2α ratio in CT-1 and had a quadratic effect (P < 0.05) on the relative expression of MMP9, PTGES2, and PTGER4. The relative expression levels of PTGER4 were reduced (P < 0.05) in CT-1 cultured with 100 μM CLA than in the unsupplemented and 10 μM-CLA groups. Treatment of CT-1 with CLA decreased PGE2 and PGF2α synthesis but a biphasic effect of CLA was observed on the PGE2:PGF2α ratio and relative abundance of transcripts with 10 μM CLA providing maximal improvements in each endpoint. Our data suggest that CLA may influence eicosanoid metabolic process and extracellular matrix remodeling.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation, as natural parts of metabolic adaptations during the transition from late gestation to early lactation, are critical indicators of dairy cows' metabolic health. This study was designed to investigate the effects of abomasal infusion of essential fatty acids (EFA), particularly α-linolenic acid, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on plasma, erythrocyte, and liver markers of oxidative stress in dairy cows during the transition period. Rumen-cannulated German Holstein cows (n = 38) in their second lactation (11,101 ± 1,118 kg milk/305 d, mean ± standard deviation) were abomasally infused with one of the following treatments from d -63 antepartum until d 63 postpartum (PP): CTRL (n = 9; 76 g/d coconut oil); EFA (n = 9; 78 g/d linseed plus 4 g/d safflower oil); CLA (n = 10; isomers cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA; 38 g/d); and EFA+CLA (n = 10; 120 g/d). Hematological parameters as well as markers of oxidative status were measured in plasma, erythrocytes, and liver before and after calving. Immunohematological parameters, including erythrocyte number, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, leukocytes, and basophils, were affected by time, and their peak levels were observed on the day after calving. The oxidative stress markers glutathione peroxidase 1 and reactive oxygen metabolites in plasma and erythrocytes were both affected by time, exhibiting the highest levels on d 1 PP, whereas β-carotene, retinol, and tocopherol were at their lowest levels at the same time. Immunohematological parameters were only marginally affected by fatty acid treatment in a time-dependent manner. As such, lymphocyte and atypical lymphocyte counts were both significantly highest in the groups that received EFA at d 1 PP. Moreover, EFA supplementation increased the mean corpuscular volume and showed a trend for induction of mean corpuscular hemoglobin compared with the CLA group during the transition period. The PP mean thrombocyte volume was higher in the EFA than in the CLA group (except for d 28) and both EFA and CLA reduced number of thrombocytes and thrombocrit at distinct time points. Hepatic mRNA abundance of markers related to oxidative status, including glutathione peroxidase (GPX-1) and catalase (CAT), was lower (P < 0.05) in EFA-treated than non-EFA-treated cows at d 28 PP. Dairy cows at the onset of lactation were characterized by induced markers of both oxidative stress and inflammation. Supplementing EFA and CLA had minor and time-dependent effects on markers of oxidative stress in plasma, erythrocytes, and liver. A comparison of EFA supplementation with CLA or CTRL showed higher immunohematological response at d 1 PP and lower hepatic antioxidant levels by d 28 PP. Supplementation with EFA+CLA had only a minor effect on oxidative markers, which were more similar to those with the EFA treatment. Altogether, despite the time-dependent differences, the current findings show only minor effects of EFA and CLA supplementation in the prevention of early lactation-induced oxidative stress.",

However, the resistance of cancer cells to cisplatin and additionally serious side effects from cisplatin limit its use. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been shown to suppress the development of carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo studies and has antitumoral activity in many cancers. The study aimed to investigate the potential effect of using cisplatin, the first-line treatment for NSCLC, in combination with CLA to increase its efficacy in low-dose use. MTT cytotoxicity assay was performed to determine the effects of CLA in combination with cisplatin on cell viability of NSCLC cell lines. The apoptotic effect of this combination on NSCLC cell lines and cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. At the same time, apoptosis and cell cycle-related gene expression levels were determined by Real-Time PCR. Combination treatment of low-dose cisplatin with CLA resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability compared to cisplatin alone, and an increase in the rate of apoptotic cells was observed. While cisplatin caused G1 phase arrest in cancer cells, there was an increase in cell percentages in S and G2 phases after combined application with CLA. In high-dose cisplatin administration, it was observed that the efficiency of the decrease in anti-apoptotic BCL2 expression related to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents was less than that of low-dose cisplatin administration. Combined administration of high-dose cisplatin with CLA significantly recovered BCL2 downregulation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer cis-9, trans-11 is an anticarcinogen that inhibits cell proliferation and/or induces apoptosis of tumor cells. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of genes responsible for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in tumor explants of mammary anaplastic carcinoma (AC) and mammary tubulopapillary carcinoma (TC) cultured in vitro with the CLA isomers cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12. METHODS: In this study we used mammary explants from two adult female dogs that revealed two types of malignant tumors: (a) anaplastic mammary carcinoma (AC) and (b) mammary tubulopapillary carcinoma (TC). The explants (n = 6 per treatment) had an average weight of 80.0 ± 2.0 mg and were cultured for 24 h in 35 mm culture plates under the following treatments: (a) Control: Culture medium + fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA); (b) Culture medium + cis-9, trans-11 CLA (75 µM) diluted with fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA), and; (c) Culture medium + trans-10, cis-12 CLA (75 µM) diluted with fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA). After that, total RNA was extracted, complementary DNA was synthesized (cDNA), and quantitative analysis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. RESULTS: Compared with the Control, the CLA trans-10, cis-12 treatment decreased expression of the gene encoding the p53 by 20% (P = 0.02), Caspase-3 by 25% (P = 0.06) and Bax by 51% (P = 0.001) in AC. The CLA cis-9, trans-11 increased the gene expression of proapoptotic protein Bax in TC by 68% (P = 0.01), but increased the expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl2 gene in AC by 72% (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The CLA cis-9, trans-11 stimulates apoptotic genes in mammary tubulopapillary carcinoma, but has a contrary effect on the anaplastic carcinoma, and the CLA trans-10, cis-12 stimulates cell cycle progression genes and may have an antiapoptotic effect, mainly in mammary anaplastic carcinoma.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore whether conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) could alleviate fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) induced by estradiol benzoate intramuscular injection in laying hens. One hundred male Hy-Line white chickens were randomly divided into two groups, namely, the control (CON) and estradiol benzoate (E) groups, and both groups were fed the same basal diet. After injections of estradiol benzoate at 2 mg/kg every two days for a total of 7 times, chickens in the E group showed FLHS symptoms, including liver enlargement, hemorrhage, and steatosis. Then half of the chickens in the E group received an additional diet containing 5000 mg/kg CLA for 8 weeks. The results of morphological observations, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and Oil Red O staining showed that CLA alleviated liver enlargement, hemorrhage, and lipid accumulation in FLHS chickens. In addition, we measured liver function and lipid metabolism indicators, including ALT, AST, TG, TCH, HDL-C, and LDL-C, which further suggested that CLA mitigated the disturbance of serum and liver metabolism in FLHS chickens. Mechanistically, CLA inhibited hepatic de novo lipogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and TG accumulation and increased TG hydrolysis in FLHS chickens by regulating the gene expression of CD36, ACC, FAS, SCD 1, DGAT2, LIPE, ATGL, CPT1A, SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, PPARγ, and PPARα. Furthermore, CLA ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress and inhibited NF-κB signaling pathway-mediated inflammation in FLHS chickens. In conclusion, CLA regulated lipid metabolism, thus further alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation to alleviate FLHS induced by estrogen in chickens.",

      "abstract": "Certain dietary supplements such as trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10-c12 CLA), and diets including caloric-restricted diets can promote weight loss in certain animal models and humans. A very recent study showed that exercise induces the biosynthesis of N-lactoyl-phenylalanine (Lac-Phe), a circulating signaling metabolite that suppresses feeding and obesity selectively in mice fed with a high-fat diet, and that cytosolic nonspecific dipeptidase 2 (CNDP2) catalyzes the synthesis of Lac-Phe from lactate (Lac) and phenylalanine (Phe). In this in silico study, we found that two anti-obesity strategies, namely treatment with t10-c12 CLA and caloric restriction, increase CNDP2 expression in adipose tissue in mice and rats, respectively. We showed that the effect of t10-c12 CLA on CNDP2 expression might be isomer-specific. We hypothesized that these t10-c12 CLA treatment- or caloric-restricted diet-mediated increases in CNDP2 expression might contribute to their anti-obesity effects, possibly due to increased Lac-Phe levels and ultimately due to Lac-Phe-mediated decreases in daily food consumption, reduced body weight and fat mass. A better understanding of the regulation of CNDP2 expression in diverse tissues in mammals might be of high importance in the treatment of obesity, considering its role in the synthesis of Lac-Phe, a metabolite that decreases body weight and fat mass selectively in mice fed with a high-fat diet. Further research is needed to find out how these two strategies lead to the upregulation of CNDP2 expression and whether this increased expression of CNDP2 might translate to reduced body weight and fat mass through higher Lac-Phe levels.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Adaptive immunity is crucial in controlling Giardia lamblia infection in the intestinal mucosa, and some dietary lipids may improve mucosal immune function. The aim of this study was to evaluate conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the Th17/Treg response and secretory IgA production in a model of giardiasis infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C3H/HeN male mice were infected with 5×106 G. lamblia trophozoites (GS/M-83-H7, ATCC collection). Mice were assigned randomly to experimental and control groups. CLA was administered to the experimental group and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was given to the control group. Parasite load kinetics was determined. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to evaluate IgA and cytokines. Nuclear transcription factors and cytokines were measured by RT-qPCR, and histology of small bowel cells was evaluated. RESULTS: CLA administration reduced the parasite load (P<0.05) and increased early Giardia-specific secretory IgA production. CLA also increased the expression of interleukin-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (P<0.05), while infection elevated the expression of Foxp3, with a peak at 40 days post-infection (P<0.05). There were no pathological changes in the colonic mucosa due to infection or treatment. Thus, CLA stimulated mucosal immunity and enhanced the humoral response against G. lamblia, not only for early infection control but also to promote regulatory cytokine production at 40 dpi, restoring the intestinal balance after parasite elimination. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal novel anti-parasitic effects through the immune-modulatory activity of CLA against the intestinal parasite G. lamblia."

      "abstract": "Intramuscular fat (IMF) is correlated positively with meat tenderness, juiciness and taste that affected sensory meat quality. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been extensively researched to increase IMF content in animals, however, the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) gene has been proposed as candidates for IMF accretion. The purpose of this study is to explore the molecular regulatory pathways of CLA on intramuscular fat deposition. Here, our results by cell lines indicated that CLA treatment promoted the expression of A-FABP through activated the transcription factor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Moreover, in an animal model, we discovered that dietary supplemental with CLA significantly enhanced IMF deposition by up-regulating the mRNA and protein expression of PPARα and A-FABP in the muscle tissues of mice. In addition, our current study also demonstrated that dietary CLA increased mRNA expression of genes and enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and lipid metabolism the muscle tissues of mice. These findings suggest that CLA mainly increases the expression of A-FABP through PPARα signaling pathway and regulates the expression of genes and enzymes related to IMF deposition, thus increasing IMF content. These results contribute to better understanding the molecular mechanism of IMF accretion in animals for the improvement of meat quality."

The diet supplementing with CLA is an emerging area, requiring studies to elucidate its effects on animals and human reproduction, as well as its side effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CLA gastric administration, during the pregestational and gestational period in biometric and reproductive parameters, as well as in ovarian morphophysiology. Animals were distributed in three groups: (1) control (n = 10); (2) fish oil (n = 10); and (3) CLA (n = 10), that daily received, by gavage, phosphate-buffered saline, fish oil and CLA, respectively, carried out over 50 days (before mating, mating and pregnancy). There was an increment in the nasoanal distance and Lee index of the CLA and fish oil-treated groups during the first weeks (P > 0.05). CLA administration did not affect the ovarian follicle mobilization (P > 0.05), the number of follicles (P > 0.05) and the integrated density of lipid content of oocytes included in antral follicles (P > 0.05). There was no effect of CLA administration on the litter weight (P > 0.05; F2 and F3), however, an increment (P < 0.05) in the number of pups per litter (F2) was observed. Overall, this study demonstrated the absence of side effects of the CLA gastric administration on mice reproductive performance and suggests that this treatment would transgenerationally enhance fertility in this species.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A growing number of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and recurrence frequency recently have drawn researchers' attention to alternative approaches. The concept of differentiation therapies (DT) relies on inducing differentiation in HCC cells in order to inhibit recurrence and metastasis. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) is the key hepatogenesis transcription factor and its upregulation may decrease the invasiveness of cancerous cells by suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) treatment, natural ligand of HNF4α, on the proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities of HCC cells in vitro. Materials and Method. Sk-Hep-1 and Hep-3B cells were treated with different doses of CLA or BIM5078 [1-(2'-chloro-5'-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-2-methylbenzimidazole], an HNF4α antagonist. The expression levels of HNF4a and EMT related genes were evaluated and associated to hepatocytic functionalities, migration, and colony formation capacities, as well as to viability and proliferation rate of HCC cells. RESULTS: In both HCC lines, CLA treatment induced HNF4α expression in parallel to significantly decreased EMT marker levels, migration, colony formation capacity, and proliferation rate, whereas BIM5078 treatment resulted in the opposite effects. Moreover, CLA supplementation also upregulated ALB, ZO1, and HNF4α proteins as well as glycogen storage capacity in the treated HCC cells. CONCLUSION: CLA treatment can induce a remarkable hepatocytic differentiation in HCC cells and attenuates cancerous features. This could be as a result of HNF4a induction and EMT inhibition."

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the effect of CLA on obesity and lipid metabolism and its possible mechanism. METHODS: Eight-month-old male BKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ Leprdb /JNju (db/db) mice (n = 12) were fed a CLA mix composed of equivalent c9, t11-CLA and t10, c12-CLA for 1 month. The effect of CLA on body weight, water and food intake, and triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels was investigated. PPARα, PPARγ and CD36 expression was determined by quantitative PCR and western blotting. Additionally, the expression of these three genes was studied in HepG2 cells treated with CLA and linoleic acid. RESULTS: CLA treatment notably reduced the dietary and water intake of db/db mice, effectively reduced body weight, and decreased serum TG and TC levels (p < 0.05). Increased expression of PPARα (p < 0.05) and decreased expression of CD36 (p < 0.001) were observed in the liver of mice that were fed CLA. CLA increased PPARα expression (p < 0.001) and decreased PPARγ (p < 0.001) and CD36 expression (p < 0.01) in HepG2 cells.

However, the benefits of CLA combined with exercise remain unclear, and studies report conflicting results. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to investigate the synergistic effect of CLA and exercise on body composition, exercise-related indices, insulin resistance, and lipid profiles; and of the safety of CLA supplements. DATA SOURCES: In October 2021, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for reports on clinical trials of the combined intervention of CLA and exercise. DATA EXTRACTION: A total of 18 randomized controlled trials and 2 crossover trials were included. The methodological quality assessment was performed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Pooled effect sizes were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio for dichotomous data with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was tested using the I2 statistic. DATA ANALYSIS: The combination of CLA and exercise resulted in significantly decreased body fat (SMD, -0.42 [95%CI, -0.70, -0.14]; P = 0.003; I2 = 65) and insulin resistance (SMD, -0.25 [95%CI, -0.44, -0.06]; P = 0.01; I2 = 0) than did exercise alone. In subgroup analysis, the following factors were associated with significant outcomes: (1) body mass index ≥25 kg/m2; (2) female sex; (3) follow-up time >4 weeks; and (4) intervention duration >4 weeks. Nevertheless, supplementation with CLA during exercise programs was not effective for body-weight control, exercise performance enhancement, or lipid-profile improvement. CLA in combination with exercise did not result in a higher risk of adverse events (risk ratio, 1.32 [95%CI, 0.94-1.84]; P > 0.05; I2 = 0). CONCLUSION: CLA combined with exercise is generally safe and can lower body fat and insulin resistance but does not reduce body weight, enhance exercise performance, or improve lipid profiles.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation and glucose dysmetabolism are pathological signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dietary aluminum (Al) overload is often used to induce AD in rodents and trigger the onset of oxidative-stress hallmarks resembling those of the human disease. The Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), owing to its key role in redox homeostasis, mitochondrial function and inflammation, is a promising drug target for neurological disorders, but only a few data are available on its modulatory effects on glucose transporter expression levels. While it has been found that the protective effect of Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) occurs through the activation of an Nrf2-mediated adaptive response, its beneficial effect on the considered pathological signs in the Al-induced model has not been established yet. Thirty-five male BalbC mice were divided into 5 groups: two Al-intoxicated groups were treated for 5 weeks with low or high Al doses (8 or 100 mg/kg/day in drinking water, respectively; L or H). Two groups of animals, orally supplemented with CLA (600 mg/kg bw/day) for 7 weeks (2 preliminary weeks plus the 5-week treatment with Al; CLA + L, CLA + H) were used to investigate its protective effect, while untreated mice were used as control (Cntr). We provide evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction, Nrf2 alteration, inflammation and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) hyperactivation can occur even from L exposure. Interestingly, animal pre-treatment with an allometric CLA dose led to significant downregulation of the toxic effects elicited by L or H, likely through the activation of an adaptive response. In conclusion, CLA ability to increase the level of glucose transporters - along with its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect - expands the therapeutic targets of these molecules and comes out as an intriguing suitable candidate for the treatment of multifactorial disease.",

      "abstract": "Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) are thought to pose beneficial effects on inflammatory responses and oxidative stress (OS). Thus, the present systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to assess the net effects of CLA supplementation on various OS parameters and antioxidant enzymes. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for publications on CLA supplementation effects on OS parameters up to March 2021. The data extracted from eligible studies were expressed as standardized mean difference with 95% confidence intervals and then combined into meta-analysis using the random-effects model. Overall, 11 RCTs (enrolling 586 participants) met the inclusion criteria and were included in meta-analysis; however, since those trials evaluated different OS parameters, meta-analysis was carried out considering different sets for each parameter separately. According to our results, CLA supplementation significantly increases 8-iso-PGF2α urinary concentration (SMD: 2; 95% CI: 0.74, 3.27; I2 = 87.7%). On contrary, the intervention does not seem to change 15-keto-dihydro-PGF2α urinary concentration, nor the serum levels of CAT, SOD, GPx and MDA. Taken all together, CLA supplementation does not appear to have substantial effects on OS markers in general; albeit due to relatively small sample size and high level of heterogeneity between studies, the obtained findings should be interpreted with caution. Further large well-designed RCTs, investigating the impact of CLA and including various groups of patients, are still needed.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to reveal the CLA-induced changes in the plasma metabolome associated with body composition improvement and the predictive performance of baseline metabolome on intervention responsiveness. METHODS: Plasma metabolome from overnight fasted samples at pre- and post-intervention of 65 participants in a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled trial (3.2 g/day CLA vs 3.2 g/day sunflower oil) were analyzed using untargeted LC-MS metabolomics. Mixed linear model and machine learning were applied to assess differential metabolites between treatments, and to identify optimal panel (based on baseline conventional variables vs metabolites) predicting responders of CLA-derived body composition improvement (increased muscle variables or decreased adiposity variables) based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, CLA altered 57 metabolites (P < 0.10) enriched in lipids/lipid-like molecules including glycerophospholipids (n = 7), fatty acyls (n = 6), and sphingolipids (n = 3). CLA-upregulated cholic acid (or downregulated aminopyrrolnitrin) was inversely correlated with changes in muscle and adiposity variables. Inter-individual variability in response to CLA-derived body composition change. The areas under the curves of optimal metabolite panels were higher than those of optimal conventional panels in predicting favorable response of waist circumference (0.93 [0.82-1.00] vs 0.64 [0.43-0.85]), visceral adiposity index (0.95 [0.88-1.00] vs 0.58 [0.35-0.80]), total fat mass (0.94 [0.86-1.00] vs 0.69 [0.51-0.88]) and appendicular fat mass (0.97 [0.92-1.00] vs 0.73 [0.55-0.91]) upon CLA supplementation (all FDR P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Post-intervention metabolite alterations were identified, involving in lipid/energy metabolism, associated with body composition changes. Baseline metabolite profiling enhanced the prediction accuracy for responsiveness of CLA-induced body composition benefits.",

The purpose of this study was to synthesize novel trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)-coated SPIONs loaded with PTX to enhance the anti-proliferative activity of PTX. CLA-coated PTX-SPIONs with a particle size and zeta potential of 96.5 ± 0.6 nm and -27.3 ± 1.9 mV, respectively, were synthesized. The superparamagnetism of the CLA-coated PTX-SPIONs was confirmed, with saturation magnetization of 60 emu/g and 29 Oe coercivity. CLA-coated PTX-SPIONs had a drug loading efficiency of 98.5% and demonstrated sustained site-specific in vitro release of PTX over 24 h (i.e., 94% at pH 6.8 mimicking the tumor microenvironment). Enhanced anti-proliferative activity was also observed with the CLA-coated PTX-SPIONs against a lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cell line after 72 h, with a recorded cell viability of 17.1%. The CLA-coated PTX-SPIONs demonstrated enhanced suppression of A549 cell proliferation compared to pristine PTX, thus suggesting potential application of the nanomedicine as an effective site-specific delivery system for enhanced therapeutic activity in NSCLC therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is an effective supplement for reducing fat mass, but its effect on hepatic steatosis remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effect of CLA on liver fat accumulation, inflammation, gut microbiome, and intestinal barrier integrity. DESIGN: Wild-type (WT) mice and ob/ob (OB) mice were randomly divided into four groups according to the treatment with/without 1% CLA: WT, WT mice treated with CLA (WT-CLA), OB, and OB mice treated with CLA (OB-CLA). Lipid metabolism and hepatic fat accumulation were evaluated by changes in histological and biochemical parameters. Gene expressions related to liver inflammation and intestinal barrier integrity were examined. The effect of CLA on the gut microbiota population was investigated. RESULTS: The body weight, fatty tissue mass, and serum lipid levels of the WT-CLA group and OB-CLA group were separately lower than those of the WT group and OB group, but the livers of the WT-CLA group had more fatty lipids, higher triglyceride properties, and saturated fatty acid (FA) composition than those of the WT group, which was contrary to the effect of CLA on OB mice. Real time quantitative PCR results showed that CLA increased hepatic inflammation and intestinal permeability in the WT mice, while it significantly decreased the mRNA expression of liver TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-1β and markedly ameliorated intestinal tight junction proteins in the OB mice. The gut microbiota testing indicated a higher abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lachnoclostridium, Roseburia, Dubosiella, Oscillibacter, and Anaerostipes) and a lower abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Tyzzerella and Alistipes) in the OB-CLA group than those of the OB group. Correlation analysis suggested that gut microbiota correlated with liver inflammation, intestinal permeability, and hepatic FA composition. CONCLUSION: CLA potentially contributed to ameliorating hepatic steatosis in OB mice via modulating liver inflammation, intestinal permeability, and gut microbiota, which suggests CLA is more suitable for people with obesity or overweight."

Hyperphagia and increasing body weight follow unless drastic calorie restriction is initiated. Recently, our laboratory showed that one of the genes in the deleted locus causative for PWS, Snord116, maintains increased expression of hypothalamic Nhlh2, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. We have previously also shown that obese mice with a deletion of Nhlh2 respond to a conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) diet with weight and fat loss. In this study, we investigated whether mice with a paternal deletion of Snord116 (Snord116m+/p-) would respond similarly. We found that while Snord116m+/p- mice and mice with a deletion of both Snord116 alleles were not significantly obese on a high-fat diet, they did lose body weight and fat on a high-fat/CLA diet, suggesting that the genotype did not interfere with CLA actions. There were no changes in food intake or metabolic rate, and only moderate differences in exercise performance. RNA-seq and microbiome analyses identified hypothalamic mRNAs, and differentially populated gut bacteria, that support future mechanistic analyses. CLA may be useful as a food additive to reduce obesity in humans with PWS.",

Different B. longum strains were administered at 109 cfu/day 7 days before DSS treatment. B. longum CCFM681 significantly increased goblet cells, mucin2 (MUC2), claudin-3, α-catenin1, and ZO-1, but neither B. longum CCFM760 nor B. longum CCFM642 had those protective effects. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were downregulated, while IL-10 was upregulated by B. longum CCFM681 but neither by B. longum CCFM760 nor by B. longum CCFM642. Moreover, B. longum CCFM681 treatment inhibited the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway. Furthermore, B. longum CCFM681 treatment rebalanced gut microbiota via regulating the diversity and key microorganisms. Colonic CLA concentrations in mice fed with B. longum CCFM681 were significantly higher than that of DSS-exposed mice, while those in B. longum CCFM760 and B. longum CCFM642 groups showed insignificant difference compared with the DSS group. Moreover, CLA showed a significantly positive correlation with the effectiveness of relieving colitis. B. longum CCFM681 alleviated colitis by protecting the intestinal mechanical barrier, modulating the gut microbiota, and inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB pathway and associated pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results will help the clinical trials of probiotics and the development of functional products for colitis.",

Twenty Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatments: 1) supplementing 110 g per day of fat (control), 2) supplementing 120 g per day of rumen-protected CLA. The diets were formulated to be nutritionally isocaloric and isonitrogenous. The experimental period started 21 days pre-calving and continued until 60 days in milk (DIM). Treatments had no effect on dry matter intake (DMI), body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS). The CLA treatment increased milk yield (3.04 kg per day and milk lactose concentration, but decreased milk fat concentration and, short and medium chain fatty acids concentrations. No treatment differences were observed in milk protein concentration, milk energy output and net energy balance. Serum concentrations of glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1), estradiol and progesterone were higher in CLA treated cows when compared to cows fed on the control diet. Serum beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) concentration was reduced in cows fed on the CLA treatment. Days to first insemination and days open were not different between the two treatment groups. Cows fed on the CLA supplement had increased conception rate from the first service. The results indicated that cows fed on diets supplemented with CLA produced milk with decreased milk fat concentration whereas some related cow blood serum metabolic parameters associated with reproductive response were increased and resulted in an increased conception rate from the first service."

      "abstract": "A major proportion of milk rumenic acid (RA; cis-9,trans-11 CLA) is synthesized through mammary Δ9-desaturation of vaccenic acid (VA; trans-11 18:1). Diet composition may determine the relative contribution of this endogenous synthesis to milk RA content, with effects that might differ between ruminant species. However, this hypothesis is mostly based on estimated values, proxies of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity, and indirect comparisons between publications in the literature. With the aim of providing new insights into this issue, in vivo Δ9-desaturation of 13C-labeled VA (measured via milk 13C-VA and -RA secretion) was directly compared in sheep and goats fed a diet without lipid supplementation or including 2% of linseed oil. Four Assaf sheep and 4 Murciano-Granadina goats were used in a replicated 2 × 2 crossover design to test the effects of the 2 dietary treatments during 2 consecutive 25-d periods. On d 22 of each period, 500 mg of 13C-VA were i.v. injected to each animal. Dairy performance, milk fatty acid profile, including isotope analysis, and mammary mRNA abundance of genes coding for SCD were examined on d 21 to 25 of each period. Supplementation with linseed oil improved milk fat concentration and increased the content of milk VA and RA. However, the isotopic tracer assay suggested no variation in the relative proportion of VA desaturated to milk RA, and the percentage of this CLA isomer deriving from SCD activity would remain constant regardless of dietary treatment. These results put into question a major effect of lipid supplementation on the endogenous synthesis of milk RA and support that mammary Δ9-desaturation capacity would not represent a limiting factor when designing feeding strategies to increase milk RA content. The lack of diet-induced effects was common to caprines and ovines, but inherent interspecies differences in mammary lipogenesis were found. Thus, the higher proportions of VA desaturation and endogenous synthesis of milk RA in sheep supported a greater SCD activity compared with goats, a finding that was not associated with the similar mRNA abundance of SCD1 in the 2 species. On the other hand, transfer efficiency of the isotopic tracer to milk was 37% higher in caprine than in ovine, suggesting a greater efficiency in mammary fatty acid uptake from plasma in caprine.",

Phosphatidylcholine from soya (soy-PC) was used as the comparison of PC form. Both the lipid accumulation and activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were measured to determine lipogenesis, whereas the glycerol content was measured to evaluate lipolysis. The CLA uptake also measured to find out the utilization of CLA by the cells. As a results, lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with CLA-PC (50-400 μM). Both CLA-PC and soy-PC significantly suppressed lipid accumulation compared with CLA-FFA, even though the amount of CLA in CLA-PC was a half than CLA-FFA. The CLA uptake of PC form was superior to FFA form, however, no difference was noted between CLA-PC and soy-PC. These forms exerted their antiadipogenic activity via the suppression of lipogenesis, and not by increasing lipolysis. Short-term treatment, especially in the middle stage of differentiation, was more effective than long-term treatment; especially for CLA-FFA. The antiadipogenic effect of CLA-PC was partially attributed to the chemical structure of the PC molecule. These results provide important information for the utilization of physiologically functional fatty acids and particularly CLA in the food and medical fields.",

Twenty-eight Lacaune ewes (36 (sd 2) days in lactation; 70·5 (sd) 9·6 kg of body weight), producing 1·8 (sd 0·4) kg of milk/d, were used in a completely randomised design (seven ewes/treatment) for 21 d. The treatments were: (1) Control; (2) CLA (6·4 g/d of trans-10, cis-12 CLA); (3) SA (28 g/d of SA) and (4) SA in association with trans-10, cis-12 CLA (CLASA; 6·4 g/d of trans-10, cis-12 CLA plus 28 g/d of SA). All data were analysed using a mixed model that included the fixed effect of treatment and the random effect of ewe. SA did not alter milk fat content and yield relative to Control (91·9 v. 91·2 (sd 4·1) g/d). CLASA was not able to overcome the reduction in fat content and fat yield induced by CLA (75 v. 82 (sd 0·14) g/d). SA increased the relative abundance of CD36, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) and PPAR-γ mRNA by 140, 112 and 68 % compared with CLASA. SA also reduced the relative abundance of acetyl-CoA carboxylase α promoter II and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) when compared with Control (45 and 39 %). Compared with CLA, CLASA treatment had no effect on the mRNA abundance of fatty acid synthase, lipoprotein lipase, CD36, SCD, FABP4, acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase 6, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and PPAR-γ. In conclusion, SA supplementation did not increase milk fat synthesis and did not overcome the CLA-induced milk fat depression when associated with trans-10, cis-12 CLA."

      "abstract": "Two common conjugated linoleic acids (LAs), cis-9, trans-11 CLA (c9,t11 CLA) and trans-10, cis-12 CLA (t10,c12 CLA), exert various biological activities. However, the effect of CLA on the generation of neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) protein remains unclear. We found that c9,t11 CLA significantly suppressed the generation of Aβ in mouse neurons. CLA treatment did not affect the level of β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a component of active γ-secretase complex presenilin 1 amino-terminal fragment, or Aβ protein precursor (APP) in cultured neurons. BACE1 and γ-secretase activities were not directly affected by c9,t11 CLA. Localization of BACE1 and APP in early endosomes increased in neurons treated with c9,t11 CLA; concomitantly, the localization of both proteins was reduced in late endosomes, the predominant site of APP cleavage by BACE1. The level of CLA-containing phosphatidylcholine (CLA-PC) increased dramatically in neurons incubated with CLA. Incorporation of phospholipids containing c9,t11 CLA, but not t10,c12 CLA, into the membrane may affect the localization of some membrane-associated proteins in intracellular membrane compartments. Thus, in neurons treated with c9,t11 CLA, reduced colocalization of APP with BACE1 in late endosomes may decrease APP cleavage by BACE1 and subsequent Aβ generation. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of c9,t11 CLA-PC/LPC in neuronal membranes suppresses the production of neurotoxic Aβ in neurons.",

      "abstract": "Acrolein (AC) is a toxic substance that can have a neurotoxic effect. It can cause oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a dietary supplement, has many biological functions. Limited information is available about the effect of CLA on AC-induced brain toxicity. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the effect of CLA on mitochondrial oxidative stress, respiratory enzymes, krebs cycle enzymes and ATP levels in AC treated rat brain. Sprague Dawley male rats were given AC (5 mg/kg i.p.), CLA (200 mg/kg orally) and CLA with AC for six days per week for 30 days. Some oxidative stress parameters and mitochondrial enzymes such as manganese super oxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH), malate dehydrogenase, reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LP), protein carbonyl (PC), oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzymes, and ATP levels were determined. AC significantly decreased the activities of GSH, antioxidant enzymes, OXPHOS enzymes (complex I and IV), TCA enzymes (ICDH and α-KGDH) and ATP levels. Significant increases were also observed in mitochondrial LP and PC levels in AC group. Co-treatment with AC + CLA improved oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by AC. As a result of our findings, it was observed that CLA was effective in improving oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial functions in brain tissue by the effect of AC. Considering the association between neurodegenerative diseases and mitochondrial dysfunction, CLA can play a role in the prevention and therapy of neurodegenerative disorders.",

Forty-five purebred mid-lactating Chios ewes (average milk yield 2.23 kg/d in 96 ± 5 d in lactation) were offered three iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic diets (15 animals per diet) for a 10 d adaptation period followed by a 5-week recording and sampling period. The diets contained 0, 6, and 12% DDGS on DM basis for the DG0, DG6, and DG12 treatment, respectively, as a replacement of concentrate mix, whilst concentrate-to-forage ratio remained at 60:40 in all treatments. Individual milk yield, milk composition, and FA profile were recorded weekly and analyzed using a complete randomized design with repeated measurements. No significant differences were observed among groups concerning dry matter intake (overall mean of 2.59 kg/d), milk yield or 6% fat-corrected milk and milk protein percentage or protein yield. Milk fat percentage was decreased in the DG12 (4.76%) compared to DG0 (5.69%) without, however, significantly affecting the daily output of milk fat. The concentration of all major saturated FA between C4:0 to C16:0 was reduced, whereas long-chain (>16 carbons), mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated FAs were increased in the milk of DDGS groups. Among individual FA, increments of oleic acid and C18:1 trans-monoenes like C18:1 trans-10 and C18:1 trans-11 were demonstrated in DG12 group, whereas linoleic and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA cis-9, trans-11) were elevated in both DDGS groups compared to control. Changes in FA profile resulted in a decline in the atherogenic index of milk by 20% and 35% in DG6 and DG12 treatments, respectively, compared with control. In conclusion, feeding DDGS to dairy ewes increased the levels of unsaturated FA that are potentially beneficial for human health without adversely affecting milk, protein or fat yield.",

      "abstract": "A close interaction between gut immune responses and distant organ-specific autoimmunity including the CNS in multiple sclerosis has been established in recent years. This so-called gut-CNS axis can be shaped by dietary factors, either directly or via indirect modulation of the gut microbiome and its metabolites. Here, we report that dietary supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid, a mixture of linoleic acid isomers, ameliorates CNS autoimmunity in a spontaneous mouse model of multiple sclerosis, accompanied by an attenuation of intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammation as well as an increase in intestinal myeloid-derived suppressor-like cells. Protective effects of dietary supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid were not abrogated upon microbiota eradication, indicating that the microbiome is dispensable for these conjugated linoleic acid-mediated effects. Instead, we observed a range of direct anti-inflammatory effects of conjugated linoleic acid on murine myeloid cells including an enhanced IL10 production and the capacity to suppress T-cell proliferation. Finally, in a human pilot study in patients with multiple sclerosis (n = 15, under first-line disease-modifying treatment), dietary conjugated linoleic acid-supplementation for 6 months significantly enhanced the anti-inflammatory profiles as well as functional signatures of circulating myeloid cells. Together, our results identify conjugated linoleic acid as a potent modulator of the gut-CNS axis by targeting myeloid cells in the intestine, which in turn control encephalitogenic T-cell responses.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet B (UVB) has been reported to prevent bone loss by promoting the synthesis of vitamin D. However, UVB can also enhance osteoclastic differentiation, inhibit osteogenic differentiation, and cause oxidative damage. The present study aimed to analyze the osteoprotective effects of UVB and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in rats with ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis, and to determine the interactions between UVB and CLA and their effects on bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs). METHODS: In vitro, the distance of UVB irradiation and the dose of CLA were selected by immunofluorescence assays and Cytotoxicity assay. BMSCs and BMMCs were detected by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence assays. In vivo, three-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats that had undergone ovariectomy were treated with UVB and CLA. After 8 weeks of therapy, the femurs of the rats were examined by micro-computed tomography (CT) and immunohistochemical detection to assess the therapeutic efficacy. RESULTS: The least inhibitive UVB distance and dosage of CLA were selected for the in vivo experiments. CLA effectively weakened the osteogenic inhibitory effect of UVB (72 cm), significantly improved the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), promoted the formation of mineralized nodules, and alleviated the oxidative damage induced by UVB. CLA also effectively weakened the osteoclast-promoting effect of UVB (72 cm), inhibited osteoclast formation, and inhibited the inflammatory damage to BMMCs caused by UVB (72 cm) irradiation. Micro-CT results showed that UVB irradiation could promote bone formation in ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats, while CLA could significantly promote bone regeneration. Immunofluorescence assays results showed that CLA alleviated UVB-induced oxidative damage to osteoblasts. The ROS detection results demonstrated that CLA effectively alleviated UVB-induced oxidative damage to BMSCs. Furthermore, Immunohistochemical assays showed that UVB and CLA treatment increased bone density, inhibited osteolytic osteolysis, and enhanced osteogenic activity. CONCLUSIONS: CLA can effectively weaken osteoclast promotion, osteogenic inhibition, and oxidative damage caused by UVB. Combination treatment of UVB and CLA exerts an osteoprotective effect on ovariectomized osteoporotic rats and stimulates osteogenesis. The molecular mechanism of this interaction requires further investigation."

      "abstract": "Phosphoproteomics is a cutting-edge technique that can be utilized to explore adipose tissue (AT) metabolism by quantifying the repertoire of phospho-peptides (PP) in AT. Dairy cows were supplemented with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA, n = 5) or a control diet (CON, n = 5) from 63 d prepartum to 63 d postpartum; cows were slaughtered at 63 d postpartum and AT was collected. We performed a quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis of subcutaneous (SC) and omental (OM) AT using nanoUPLC-MS/MS and examined the effects of CLA supplementation on the change in the phosphoproteome. A total of 5919 PP were detected in AT, and the abundance of 854 (14.4%) were differential between CON and CLA AT (p ≤ 0.05 and fold change ± 1.5). The abundance of 470 PP (7.9%) differed between OM and SC AT, and the interaction treatment vs. AT depot was significant for 205 PP (3.5% of total PP). The integrated phosphoproteome demonstrated the up- and downregulation of PP from proteins related to lipolysis and lipogenesis, and phosphorylation events in multiple pathways, including the regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, mTOR signaling, insulin signaling, AMPK signaling, and glycolysis. The differential regulation of phosphosite on a serine residue (S777) of fatty acid synthase (FASN) in AT of CLA-supplemented cows was related to lipogenesis and with more phosphorylation sites compared to acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (ACSS2). Increased protein phosphorylation was seen in acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACACA;8 PP), FASN (9 PP), hormone sensitive lipase (LIPE;6 PP), perilipin (PLIN;3 PP), and diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLA;1 PP) in CLA vs. CON AT. The relative gene expression in the SC and OM AT revealed an increase in LIPE and FASN in CLA compared to CON AT. In addition, the expression of DAGLA, which is a lipid metabolism enzyme related to the endocannabinoid system, was 1.6-fold higher in CLA vs. CON AT, and the expression of the cannabinoid receptor CNR1 was reduced in CLA vs. CON AT. Immunoblots of SC and OM AT showed an increased abundance of FASN and a lower abundance of CB1 in CLA vs. CON. This study presents a complete map of the SC and the OM AT phosphoproteome in dairy cows following CLA supplementation and discloses many unknown phosphorylation sites, suggestive of increased lipid turnover in AT, for further functional investigation.",

      "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that the maternal supply of essential fatty acids (EFA), especially α-linolenic acid, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), affects glucose metabolism, the endocrine regulation of energy metabolism and growth, and the intestinal development of neonatal calves. We studied calves from dams that received an abomasal infusion of 76 g/d coconut oil (CTRL; n = 9), 78 g/d linseed oil and 4 g/d safflower oil (EFA; n = 9), 38 g/d Lutalin (BASF SE) containing 27% cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA (CLA; n = 9), or a combination of EFA and CLA (EFA+CLA; n = 11) during the last 63 d of gestation and early lactation. Calves received colostrum and transition milk from their own dam for the first 5 d of life. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, leptin, and adiponectin concentrations were measured in milk. Blood samples were taken before first colostrum intake, 24 h after birth, and from d 3 to 5 of life before morning feeding to measure metabolic and endocrine traits in plasma. On d 3 of life, energy expenditure was evaluated by a bolus injection of NaH13CO3 and determination of CO2 appearance rate. On d 4, additional blood samples were taken to evaluate glucose first-pass uptake and 13CO2 enrichment after [13C6]-glucose feeding and intravenous [6,6-2H2]-glucose bolus injection, as well as postprandial changes in glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), insulin, and glucagon. On d 5, calves were killed 2 h after feeding and samples of small intestinal mucosa were taken for histomorphometric measurements. The concentrations of IGF-I, adiponectin, and leptin in milk decreased during early lactation in all groups, and the concentrations of leptin in first colostrum was higher in EFA than in CTRL cows. Plasma glucose concentration before first colostrum intake was higher in EFA calves than in non-EFA calves and was lower in CLA calves than in non-CLA calves. Plasma IGF-I concentration was higher on d 1 before colostrum intake in EFA calves than in EFA+CLA calves and indicated an overall CLA effect, with lower plasma IGF-I in CLA than in non-CLA calves. Postprandial NEFA concentration was lowest in EFA and CLA calves. The postprandial rise in plasma insulin was higher in EFA than in non-EFA calves. Plasma adiponectin concentration increased from d 1 to d 2 in all groups and was higher on d 3 in CLA than in non-CLA calves. Plasma leptin concentration was higher on d 4 and 5 in EFA than in non-EFA calves. Maternal fatty acid treatment did not affect energy expenditure and first-pass glucose uptake, but glucose uptake on d 4 was faster in EFA than in non-EFA calves. Crypt depth was lower, and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth was higher in the ilea of CLA than non-CLA calves. Elevated plasma glucose and IGF-I in EFA calves immediately after birth may indicate an improved energetic status in calves when dams are supplemented with EFA. Maternal EFA and CLA supplementation influenced postprandial metabolic changes and affected factors related to the neonatal insulin response.",

Curcumin (CUR), an antioxidant compound, can be a potent treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, such as MS. CUR has poor bioavailability; therefore, it is used in nanoforms to increase its bioavailability. In the present study, the effects of CUR and conjugated linoleic acid-CUR (Lino-CUR) on spatial memory and oxidative stress in a putative animal model of MS were investigated. Forty-nine adult male Wistar rats (250 ± 50 g) were randomly divided into seven groups (n = 7): control, sham, ethidium bromide (EB), CUR (20 and 40 μg/kg) + EB, and Lino-CUR (20 and 40 μg/kg) + EB groups. Following MS induction, the groups were treated for 5 consecutive days. Finally, spatial memory and levels of oxidative stress parameters were assessed. Treatment with CUR and Lino-CUR at two doses significantly improved spatial memory and reduced oxidative stress parameters in the experimental models of MS. Furthermore, the effects of high dose (40 μg/kg) of Lino-CUR were more remarkable. These findings suggest that the microinjection of CUR in its synthetic form Lino-CUR significantly ameliorated spatial memory, through the reduction of oxidative stress markers in the brain of studied animals as a rat model of MS.",

Skeletal muscle plays an important role in this adaptation. The objective of this study was to characterize the metabolome in skeletal muscle (semitendinosus muscle) and in serum of dairy cows in the context of the physiological changes occurring in early lactation and to test the effects of dietary supplementation (from d 1 in milk onwards) with conjugated linoleic acids (sCLA; 100 g/d; supplying 7.6 g of cis-9,trans-11 CLA and 7.6 g of trans-10,cis-12 CLA per cow/d; n = 11) compared with control fat-supplemented cows (CTR; n = 10). The metabolome was characterized in skeletal muscle samples collected on d 21 and 70 after calving in conjunction with their serum counterpart using a targeted metabolomics approach (AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit; Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria). Thereby 188 metabolites from 6 different compound classes (acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and hexoses) were quantified in both sample types. In both groups, dry matter intake increased after calving. It was lower in sCLA than in CTR on d 21, which resulted in reduced calculated net energy and metabolizable protein balances. On d 21, the concentrations of dopamine, Ala, and hexoses in the skeletal muscle were higher in sCLA than in CTR. On d 21, the changed metabolites in serum were mainly long-chain (>C24) diacyl phosphatidylcholine PC (PC-aa) and acyl-alkyl phosphatidylcholine (PC-ae), along with lysophosphatidylcholine acyl (lysoPC-a) C26:1 that were all lower in sCLA than in CTR. Supplementation with CLA affected the muscle concentrations of 22 metabolites on d 70 including 10 long-chain (>C22) sphingomyelin (SM), hydroxysphingomyelin [SM(OH)], PC-aa, and PC-ae along with 9 long-chain (>C16) lysoPC-a and 3 metabolites related to amino acids (spermine, citrulline, and Asp). On d 70, the concentrations of lysoPC-a C18:2 and C26:0 in serum were higher in the sCLA cows than in the CTR cows. Regardless of treatment, the concentrations of Ile, Leu, Phe, Lys, His, Met, Trp, and hydroxybutyrylcarnitine (C4-OH) decreased, whereas those of ornithine, Gln, and trans-4-hydroxyproline (t4-OH-Pro) increased from d 21 to 70 in muscle. The significantly changed metabolites in serum with time of lactation were 28 long-chain (>C30) PC-ae and PC-aa, 7 long-chain (>C16) SM and SM(OH), along with lysoPC-a C20:3 that were all increased. In conclusion, in addition to other significantly changed metabolites, CLA supplementation mainly led to changes in muscle and serum concentrations of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids that might reflect the phospholipid compositional changes in muscle. The metabolome changes observed in sCLA on d 21 seem to be, at least in part, due to the lower DMI in these cows. The changes in the muscle concentrations of AA from d 21 to 70, which coincided with the steady energy and MP balances, might reflect a shift of protein synthesis/degradation balance toward synthesis.",

      "abstract": "This experiment was designed to investigate the effect of supplementing conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in breeder hens diet on development and hepatic lipid metabolism of chick offspring. Hy-Line Brown breeder hens were allocated into two groups, supplemented with 0 (control (CT)) or 0·5 % CLA for 8 weeks. Offspring chicks were grouped according to the mother generation and fed for 7 d. CLA treatment had no significant influence on development, egg quality and fertility of breeder hens but darkened the egg yolks in shade and increased yolk sac mass compared with the CT group. Addition of CLA resulted in increased body mass and liver mass and decreased deposition of subcutaneous adipose tissue in chick offspring. The serum TAG and total cholesterol levels of chick offspring were decreased in CLA group. CLA treatment increased the incorporation of both CLA isomers (c9t11 and t10c12) in the liver of chick offspring, accompanied by the decreased hepatic TAG levels, related to the significant reduction of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) enzyme activities and the increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1) enzyme activity. Meanwhile, CLA treatment reduced the mRNA expression of genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS, ACC and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c) and induced the expression of genes related to β-oxidative (CPT1, AMP-activated protein kinase and PPARα) in chick offspring liver. In summary, the addition of CLA in breeder hens diet significantly increased the incorporation of CLA in the liver of chick offspring, which further regulate hepatic lipid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Sufficient glucose availability is crucial for exploiting the genetic potential of milk production during early lactation, and endocrine changes are mainly related to repartitioning of nutrient supplies toward the mammary gland. Long-chain fatty acids, such as essential fatty acids (EFA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), have the potential to improve negative energy balance and modify endocrine changes. In the present study, the hypothesis that combined CLA and EFA treatment supports glucose metabolism around the time of calving and stimulates insulin action and the somatotropic axis in cows in an additive manner was tested. Rumen-cannulated German Holstein cows (n = 40) were investigated from wk 9 antepartum (AP) until wk 9 postpartum (PP). The cows were abomasally supplemented with coconut oil (CTRL, 76 g/d); 78 g/d of linseed and 4 g/d of safflower oil (EFA); Lutalin (CLA, isomers cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA, each 10 g/d); or the combination of EFA+CLA. Blood samples were collected several times AP and PP to determine the concentrations of plasma metabolites and hormones related to glucose metabolism and the somatotropic axis. Liver tissue samples were collected several days AP and PP to measure glycogen concentration and the mRNA abundance of genes related to gluconeogenesis and the somatotropic axis. On d 28 AP and 21 PP, endogenous glucose production (eGP) and glucose oxidation (GOx) were measured via tracer technique. The concentration of plasma glucose was higher in CLA than in non-CLA-treated cows, and the plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration was higher in EFA than in non-EFA cows on d 21 PP. The eGP increased from AP to PP with elevated eGP in EFA and decreased eGP in CLA-treated cows; GOx was lower in CLA than in CTRL on d 21 PP. The plasma insulin concentration decreased after calving in all groups and was higher in CLA than in non-CLA cows at several time points. Plasma glucagon and cortisol concentrations on d 21 PP were lower in CLA than non-CLA groups. The glucagon/insulin and glucose/insulin ratios were higher in CTRL than in CLA group during the transition period. Plasma IGF-I concentration was lower in EFA than non-EFA cows on d 42 AP and was higher during the dry period and early lactation in CLA than in non-CLA cows. The IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3/-2 ratio in blood plasma was higher in CLA than in non-CLA cows. Hepatic glycogen concentration on d 28 PP was higher, but the mRNA abundance of PC and IGFBP2 was lower in CLA than non-CLA cows on d 1 PP. The EFA treatment decreased the mRNA abundance of IGFBP3 AP and PCK1, PCK2, G6PC, PCCA, HMGCS2, IGFBP2, and INSR at several time points PP. Results indicated elevated concentrations of plasma glucose and insulin along with the stimulation of the somatotropic axis in cows treated with CLA, whereas EFA treatment stimulated eGP but not mRNA abundance related to eGP PP. The systemic effects of the combined EFA+CLA treatment were very similar to those of CLA treatment, but the effects on hepatic gene expression partially corresponded to those of EFA treatment.",

A 0.5% iodine containing soy oil in glass box with a glass lid was photoisomerized, under natural solar light for 0, 11, and 27 days, and CLA isomers were determined with gas chromatography with flame ionization detector. After 27 days of solar light photoisomerization, the cis-9, trans-11 CLA; other cis, trans CLA; trans-10, cis-12 CLA; trans, trans CLA, and total CLA were found to be 0.62 ± 0.05%, 1.04 ± 0.09%, 0.54 ± 0.11%, 6.16 ± 0.68%, and 8.37 ± 0.90%, respectively. The concentration of CLA isomers between 0 and 11 days was significantly different (p < .05), and the concentration of CLA isomers between 0 and 27 days was also significantly different (p < .05). There is no significant difference (p > .05) in CLA concentration between 11 and 27 days treatment. The CLA was not found in control soy oil samples. The CLA isomers were measured with GDFID in 45 min instead of 120min. The temperature of the edible oil in glass boxes ranged from 26 °C (8 a.m.) to 56 °C (1 p.m.). The light intensity ranged from 4,146 lux (7 p.m.) to 95,490 lux (12 p.m.). Glass lid on the glass box affected light transmission to a small but statistically significant extent (p < .05). The CLA isomers could be energy efficiently and inexpensively produced in soy oil by solar light photoisomerization, at low temperature and without needing expensive reactor vessels or catalysts. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: CLA was produced effectively with the iodine sensitized solar light photoisomerization. CLA is produced in large quantities, inexpensively, for possible food additive applications. Produced CLA is in the form of stable triacylglycerides.",

CLA was prepared by a simulated moving bed chromatography system and its influence on the gut microbes was analyzed by 16S amplicon V3-V4 region analysis. We observed a significant increase in the bacterial biodiversity and the abundance of genera of butyrate- and acetate-producing bacteria. After taking CLA for 6 weeks, the abundance of Bacteroides in the intestines of mice greatly increased, while the abundance of Firmicutes decreased. The corresponding decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio reflected a positive modulatory effect of CLA on the intestinal microbiota. In addition, KEGG pathways for the nucleotide metabolism, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides and lipid metabolism were among the most differentially expressed genes after CLA intervention. The current study revealed that CLA can be used as a functional food component with potential therapeutic value to prevent obesity-related metabolic disorders by manipulating the intestinal microbiota.",

      "abstract": "Dairy cows are exposed to increased inflammatory processes in the transition period from late pregnancy to early lactation. Essential fatty acids (EFA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) are thought to modulate the inflammatory response in dairy cows. The present study investigated the effects of a combined EFA and CLA infusion on the fatty acid (FA) status in plasma lipids, and whether changes in the FA pattern were associated with the acute phase and inflammatory response during late pregnancy and early lactation. Rumen-cannulated Holstein cows (n = 40) were assigned from wk 9 antepartum to wk 9 postpartum to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Cows were abomasally supplemented with coconut oil (CTRL, 76 g/d), linseed and safflower oil (EFA, 78 g/d of linseed oil and 4 g/d of safflower oil; ratio of oils = 19.5:1; n-6:n-3 FA ratio = 1:3), Lutalin (CLA, 38 g/d; isomers cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12; each 10 g/d), or both (EFA+CLA). Blood samples were taken to measure changes in FA in blood plasma on d -63, -42, 1, 28, and 56, and in plasma lipid fractions (cholesterol esters, free fatty acids, phospholipids, and triglycerides) on d -42, 1, and 56 relative to calving, and in erythrocyte membrane (EM) on d 56 after calving. Traits related to the acute phase response and inflammation were measured in blood throughout the study. Liver samples were obtained for biopsy on d -63, -21, 1, 28, and 63 relative to calving to measure the mRNA abundance of genes related to the inflammatory response. The concentrations of α-linolenic acid and n-3 FA metabolites increased in lipid fractions (especially phospholipids) and EM due to EFA supplementation with higher α-linolenic acid but lower n-3 metabolite concentrations in EFA+CLA than in EFA treatment only. Concentration of linoleic acid decreased in plasma fat toward calving and increased during early lactation in all groups. Concentration of plasma arachidonic acid was lower in EFA- than in non-EFA-treated groups in lipid fractions and EM. The cis-9,trans-11 CLA increased in all lipid fractions and EM after both CLA treatments. Plasma haptoglobin was lowered by EFA treatment before calving. Plasma bilirubin was lower in EFA and CLA than in CTRL at calving. Plasma concentration of IL-1β was higher in EFA than in CTRL and EFA+CLA at certain time points before and after calving. Plasma fibrinogen dropped faster in CLA than in EFA and EFA+CLA on d 14 postpartum. Plasma paraoxonase tended to be elevated by EFA treatment, and was higher in EFA+CLA than in CTRL on d 49. Hepatic mRNA abundance revealed time changes but no treatment effects with respect to the inflammatory response. Our data confirmed the enrichment of n-3 FA in EM by EFA treatment and the inhibition of n-3 FA desaturation by CLA treatment. The elevated n-3 FA status and reduced n-6:n-3 ratio by EFA treatment indicated a more distinct effect on the inflammatory response during the transition period than the single CLA treatment, and the combined EFA+CLA treatment caused minor additional changes on the anti-inflammatory response.",

Four cows (126 ± 4 d in milk) were used in a dose-escalation study design and were abomasally infused with coconut oil (CTRL; 38.3 g/d; providing saturated fatty acids), linseed and safflower oils (EFA; 39.1 and 1.6 g/d; n-6:n-3 FA ratio = 1:3), Lutalin (CLA; cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA, 4.6 g/d of each), or EFA and CLA (EFA+CLA) for 6 wk. The initial dosage was doubled twice after 2 wk, resulting in 3 dosages (dosages 1, 2, and 3). Each cow received each fat treatment at different times. Cows were fed with a corn silage-based total mixed ration providing a low-fat content and a high n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio. Plasma concentrations of metabolites and hormones (insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins only on wk 0 and 6) were analyzed at wk 0, 2, 4, and 6 of each treatment period. Liver biopsies were taken before starting the trial and at wk 6 of each treatment period to measure hepatic mRNA abundance of genes linked to glucose, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, and the somatotropic axis. The changes in the milk and blood fatty acid patterns and lactation performance of these cows have already been published in a companion paper. The plasma concentration of total cholesterol increased with dosage in all groups, except CLA, reaching the highest levels in EFA+CLA and CTRL compared with CLA. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentration increased in CTRL and was higher than that in EFA and CLA, whereas the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in a dose-dependent manner in EFA and EFA+CLA, and was higher than that in CLA. Hepatic mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase 1 was upregulated in all groups but was highest in EFA+CLA. Expression of sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1 tended to be lowest due to EFA treatment, whereas expression of long chain acyl-CoA-synthetase was lower in EFA than in CTRL. Hepatic mRNA expression of GHR1A tended to be higher in EFA+CLA than in CTRL. The plasma concentration of insulin-like growth factor I increased in CLA, and the plasma IGFBP-2 concentration was lower in EFA+CLA than in CTRL at wk 6. The plasma concentration of adiponectin decreased in EFA+CLA up to dosage 2. Plasma concentrations of albumin and urea were lower in CLA than in CTRL throughout the experimental period. Supplementation with EFA and CLA affected cholesterol and lipid metabolism and their regulation differently, indicating distinct stimulation after the combined EFA and CLA treatment. The decreased IGFBP-2 plasma concentration and upregulated hepatic mRNA abundance of GHR1A in EFA+CLA-supplemented cows indicated the beneficial effect of the combined EFA and CLA treatment on the somatotropic axis in mid-lactation dairy cows. Moreover, supplementation with CLA might affect protein metabolism in dairy cows.",

      "abstract": "Proteasomes play a widespread role in the control of protein abundance via degrading ubiquitinated proteins. Activity of proteasomes is regulated by constitutive ATPases that respond to intracellular concentrations of ATP. Although recent data suggest a role of proteasomes in fatty acid metabolism, whether lipogenic activity in mammary cells is responsive to ATP concentrations and proteasome activity is unknown. To investigate whether proteasomes play a role in milk fat depression induced by trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10,c12 CLA), a bovine mammary epithelial cell line was treated with t10,c12 CLA for 24 h before analysis of lipogenic protein abundance. Western blot analysis of inactive sterol response element-binding protein-1 (pSREBP1) and active (nSREBP1) fragments indicated a decrease in abundance induced by exogenous t10,c12 CLA. At 150 nM t10,c12 CLA, abundance of both pSREBP1 and nSREBP1 was lowest, and decreased from basal levels by 16 and 64%, respectively. Exogenous t10,c12 CLA had no effect on abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), but at 150 and 300 nM it decreased abundance of SREBF chaperone (SCAP). Inhibition of proteasome activity via incubation with MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor) alone had no effect on pSREBP1, nSREBP1, PPARγ, or SCAP abundance. However, when cells were pre-incubated with MG-132, treatment with t10,c12 CLA reduced pSREBP1 (∼27%) and nSREBP1 (∼41%) abundance without affecting PPARγ or SCAP. Compared with the control, exogenous t10,c12 CLA increased ATP concentrations, and MG-132 alone had no effect. However, ATP concentration decreased markedly in cells incubated with both MG-132 and t10,c12 CLA. Combined with the alteration of SCAP and nSREBP1, the increase of ATP concentrations with t10,c12 CLA suggested that this fatty acid influenced the function of the SREBP1-SCAP complex through altering proteasome activity. Collectively, the current data highlight a role of proteasomes and intracellular ATP concentrations in the antilipogenic effect induced by t10,c12 CLA that leads to milk fat depression.",

      "abstract": "The conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers, a group of naturally occurring isomers of the essential fatty acid (FA) linoleic acid, have received special attention in animal and human nutrition. Although they have long been used as dietary integrators in dairy cows, the effects of CLA isomers on bovine immune cells remain mostly undisclosed. The present study aimed to cover this gap and investigate the in vitro effects of CLA on inflammatory functions, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, killing capability, and extracellular respiratory burst of purified bovine monocytes (CD14+). The apoptosis rate of monocytes was addressed as well. Once assessed, the effects of different concentrations (10, 50, 100, and 500 μM) of the 2 main CLA isomers, namely cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12, the experiments were carried out using a concentration of 50 μM of the CLA isomers, both individually and in a mixture (50:50). The immunomodulatory activities of linoleic acid, an essential FA, and stearic acid, a saturated FA, were also investigated. Only the 50:50 CLA mixture was able to reduce monocyte apoptosis and to increase the extracellular respiratory burst during experimental proinflammatory conditions, as assessed by measuring production of reactive oxygen species. Linoleic acid and CLA had no effects on chemotaxis, phagocytosis, or killing capability. Remarkably, treatment of monocytes with stearic acid significantly reduced their chemotactic capability. The present results demonstrated that CLA isomers do have immunomodulatory effects on some functions of bovine monocytes, and that the mixture of the 2 CLA isomers is more effective than the CLA isomers individually.",

Optimized conditions were 5.7 meat pH, 5% hydrolyzed safflower oil addition, 108 CFU/g added starter culture, fermentation time of 73 h for L. plantarum DSM2601 and 79 h for L. plantarum AB20-961, 24 °C fermentation temperature, 65 °C internal cooking temperature and 90% relative humidity. Results indicated that CLA contents in sausages were increased 21% by L. plantarum AB20-961 and 121% by L. plantarum DSM2601 after fermentation compared to initial CLA level determined on manufacturing day (P < .05). After fermentation, an increased CLA content of sausages remained stable during heat processing and storage. Sausages incorporated with L. plantarum strains and hydrolyzed safflower oil had the highest TBARS and PUFA levels, and the lowest pH and moisture content (P < .05). Differences were not found in sensorial and other physicochemical properties among sausage treatment groups. This study demonstrated that high CLA content can be achieved in sausages by utilizing optimum processing conditions described above and starter cultures (L. plantarum AB20-961 and L. plantarum DSM2601) without any adverse effects on quality of the final product.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by systemic inflammation and accelerated inflammaging of the lungs. Some studies showed that conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of CLA supplementation on serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in patients with COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 82 patients with stable COPD were enrolled in a double blind clinical trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: placebo (n=42) and 3.2 g CLA daily supplementation (n=40). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1%), BODE index, and serum levels of IL-6, and SIRT1 were measured at the baseline and six weeks after the intervention. In addition, the study parameters in the two groups were compared based on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria. RESULTS: After supplementation with CLA, serum levels of IL-6 and BODE index significantly decreased (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively). In addition, serum levels of SIRT1 (p<0.01) and FEV1 (p<0.001) significantly increased in the supplementation group. Based on GOLD criteria, the increase in SIRT1 and the decrease in IL-6 serum levels were found to be statistically significant in stages III and IV in the supplementation group (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with CLA can modify the inflammatory markers and improve the health status of COPD patients. The results suggest that CLA supplementation in COPD patients can be useful in the management of the disease."

      "abstract": "Rations including high amounts of corn silage are currently very common in dairy production. Diets with corn silage as forage source result in a low supply of essential fatty acids, such as α-linolenic acid, and may lead to low conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) production. The present study investigated the effects of abomasal infusion of essential fatty acids, especially α-linolenic acid, and CLA in dairy cows fed a corn silage-based diet on performance, milk composition, including fatty acid (FA) pattern, and lipid metabolism from late to early lactation. Rumen-cannulated Holstein cows (n = 40) were studied from wk 9 antepartum to wk 9 postpartum and dried off 6 wk before calving. The cows were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Cows were abomasally supplemented with coconut oil (CTRL, 76 g/d), linseed and safflower oil (EFA, 78 and 4 g/d; linseed/safflower oil ratio = 19.5:1; n-6/n-3 FA ratio = 1:3), Lutalin (CLA, 38 g/d; BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany; isomers cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 each 10 g/d) or EFA+CLA. Milk composition was analyzed weekly, and blood samples were taken several times before and after parturition to determine plasma concentrations of metabolites related to lipid metabolism. Liver samples were obtained by biopsy on d 63 and 21 antepartum and on d 1, 28, and 63 postpartum to measure triglyceride concentration. Body composition was determined after slaughter. Supplementation of CLA reduced milk fat concentration, increased body fat mass, and improved energy balance (EB) in late and early lactation, but EB was lowest during late lactation in the EFA group. Cows with CLA treatment alone showed an elevated milk citrate concentration in early lactation, whereas EFA+CLA did not reveal higher milk citrate but did have increased acetone. Milk protein was increased in late lactation but was decreased in wk 1 postpartum in CLA and EFA+CLA. Milk urea was reduced by CLA treatment during the whole period. After calving, the increase of nonesterified fatty acids in plasma was less in CLA groups; liver triglycerides were raised lowest at d 28 in CLA groups. Our data confirm an improved metabolic status with CLA but not with exclusive EFA supplementation during early lactation. Increased milk citrate concentration in CLA cows points to reduced de novo FA synthesis in the mammary gland, but milk citrate was less affected in EFA+CLA cows, indicating that EFA supplementation may influence changes in mammary gland FA metabolism achieved by CLA.",

      "abstract": "The effects of maternal conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on embryonic development and hepatic lipid metabolism were investigated in chick embryos. A total of 180 Arbor Acres female broiler breeders (36 wk old) were randomly divided into the following 3 dietary treatment groups: a basic diet (control), a basic diet containing 0.5% CLA (CLA1), and a basic diet containing 1.0% CLA (CLA2). The females were fed for 8 wk, and the eggs from each group were collected and hatched during the last 2 wk. The results showed that the addition of dietary CLA increased the broken egg rate and reduced the fertilization rate and the egg hatchability (P < 0.05). CLA enrichment decreased the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and increased the saturated fatty acids in the yolk sac (P < 0.05). The yolk sac weight, body weight, and body length had a linear decrease with CLA supplementation (P < 0.05). In the developing chick embryo (at E14) and newly hatched chick (D0), the serum triglyceride concentration decreased with maternal CLA supplementation and was accompanied by a reduction in subcutaneous adipose tissue deposition. In addition, maternal CLA supplementation mediated the hepatic lipid metabolism by decreasing the mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and increasing the mRNA expression of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α (PPARα), liver fatty acid-binding protein, adipose triglyceride lipase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase in embryonic chick livers (P < 0.05). A drop in SREBP-1c protein expression and an increase in the protein expression of p-AMPKα and PPARα were also observed in the liver of chick embryo (P < 0.05). In conclusion, maternal CLA supplementation regulated the fatty acid composition in the yolk sac, and mediated embryonic chick development and hepatic lipometabolism, and these effects may be related to the AMPK pathway. These findings suggest the potential ability of maternal CLA supplementation to reduce fat deposition in chick embryos.",

      "abstract": "Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), commonly found in beef, lamb and dairy products, has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antipruritus effects and to inhibit the release of chemical mediators such as histamine and eicosanoid in laboratory rodents. The chief objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of CLA on atopic dermatitis (AD) in mice and to explore possible mechanisms with CLA treatments. To develop a new therapy for AD, the anti-AD potential of CLA was investigated by inducing AD-like skin lesions in mice using 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. We evaluated dermatitis severity; histopathological changes; serum levels of T helper (Th) cytokines (interferon-γ, interleukin-4); changes in protein expression by western blotting and immunohistochemistry staining for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); and production of the proinflammatory lipid mediators, such as prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4, in the skin lesions. Treatment with CLA ameliorated the development of AD-like clinical symptoms and effectively inhibited epidermal hyperplasia and infiltration of mast cells and CD4+ T cells in the AD mouse skin. Total serum immunoglobulin E levels and the expression levels of Th1/Th2 cytokines and lipid mediators in dorsal skin were dramatically suppressed by CLA. Furthermore, CLA down-regulated the expressions of COX-2, 5-LOX, TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB and TNF-α. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the potential usefulness of CLA as an anti-inflammatory dietary supplement or drug for the prevention and management of AD skin diseases by modulating the COX-2/5-LOX and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways.",

Fifteen local goats from the north-east of Mexico were used. Three treatments were evaluated: (a) Control (Base diet); (b) CLA 50 g; and (c) CLA 90 g. The CLA was a mixture of micro-encapsulated FA, which supplied c9, t11 and t10, c12. Goats had an adaptation period of 2 weeks and 7 experimental weeks. The variables evaluated were body weight, DMI, milk yield, and fat, protein, and lactose yield, FA milk profile, and energy balance. The analysis of the data was analyzed as repeated measures using the PROC MIXED procedure and Tukey test (p < .05). In milk of goats from the treatment 90 g of the isomer t10, c12 CLA (p < .05) the milk fat content and milk fat yield with respect to the control treatment were reduced and the energy balance was improved. In goats treated with 11 g of t10, c12 CLA increased (p < .05) milk yield and milk lactose content.

The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary fat can overcome CLA inhibition of milk fat concentration in lactating mice. Wild type C57Bl/6J mice (n = 31) were fed semipurified diets containing either low fat (LF; 4% fat) or high fat (HF; 23.6% fat) starting 4-6 days postpartum. Dietary fat was increased by inclusion of high oleic sunflower oil. After 2 days on the experimental diets, lactating dams were orally dosed with either water (control) or trans-10, cis-12 CLA (20 mg/day) for 5 days. CLA treatment decreased pup growth similarly in both HF and LF diets. Milk fat percent was increased over 16% by the HF diet and decreased over 12% by CLA, but there was no interaction of dietary fat and CLA. Both CLA and the HF diet reduced the proportion of short- and medium-chain fatty acids that originate from de novo synthesis, and there was no interaction of diet and CLA. CLA had no effect on the percent of preformed fatty acids, but the HF diet increased their abundance. Dietary fat and CLA both modified mammary expression of lipogenic enzymes and regulators, but no interactions were observed. In conclusion, CLA reduced milk fat concentration and litter growth, but these effects were not overcome by increased dietary fat from high oleic sunflower oil. CLA inhibition of milk fat in the mammary gland is not substrate dependent, and the mechanism is independent from dietary supply of oleic acid.",

In addition, the expression of progesterone receptor and Ki-67 decreased significantly with the treatment of c9,t11-CLA. In conclusion, the dietary c9,t11-CLA enriched from butter showed a preventive effect against breast cancer in vivo via the inhibition of the hormonal receptor and cell proliferation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This paper provided new insight into the preparation of specific c9,t11-CLA isomer. It can be enriched from butter in large-scale with low-cost by urea complexation. Meanwhile, the enriched dietary c9,t11-CLA can be further processed into cancer prevention functional foods.",

      "abstract": "Trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) decreases milk fat synthesis in lactating sows and involves, at least in part, the down-regulation of lipogenic genes. The objective was to evaluate the effect of CLA on milk composition and lipogenic gene expression. Twenty multiparous sows were randomly assigned to one of the two treatments for 18 d (from day 7 to day 25 of lactation): (1) control (no CLA added) and (2) 1 % of CLA mixed into the ration. CLA treatment decreased milk fat and protein content by 20 % (P = 0·004) and 11 % (P = 0·0001), respectively. However, piglet weight did not differ between treatments (P = 0·60). Dietary CLA increased the concentration of SFA in milk fat by 16 % (P < 0·0001) and decreased MUFA by 17·6 % (P < 0·0001). In the mammary gland, CLA reduced gene expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α by 37 % (P = 0·003), fatty acid synthase by 64 % (P = 0·002), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 by 52 % (P = 0·003), lipoprotein lipase by 26 % (P = 0·03), acyl glycerol phosphate acyltransferase 6 by 15 % (P = 0·02) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 by 27 % (P = 0·02), whereas the expression of fatty acid binding protein 3 was not altered by CLA treatment (P = 0·09). Mammary expression of casein-β and α-lactalbumin was reduced by CLA by 68 % (P = 0·0004) and 62 % (P = 0·005), respectively. Additionally, CLA had no effect on the expression of lipogenic genes evaluated in adipose tissue. In summary, CLA reduced milk fat content without negatively affecting litter performance and it affected mammary expression of genes involved in all lipogenic pathways studied.",

      "abstract": "Deregulation of Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) by binding to the activated calpain product p25, is associated with the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA), a calpain inhibitor, is a metabolite of Punicic Acid (PA), the main component of Pomegranate seed oil (PSO). We have shown recently that long-term administration of Nano-PSO, a nanodroplet formulation of PSO, delays mitochondrial damage and disease advance in a mouse model of genetic Creutzfeldt Jacob disease (CJD). In this project, we first demonstrated that treatment of mice with Nano-PSO, but not with natural PSO, results in the accumulation of CLA in their brains. Next, we tested the cognitive, biochemical and pathological effects of long-term administration of Nano-PSO to 5XFAD mice, modeling for Alzheimer's disease. We show that Nano-PSO treatment prevented age-related cognitive deterioration and mitochondrial oxidative damage in 5XFAD mice. Also, brains of the Nano-PSO treated mice presented reduced accumulation of Aβ and of p25, a calpain product, and increased expression of COX IV-1, a key mitochondrial enzyme. We conclude that administration of Nano-PSO results in the brain targeting of CLA, and suggest that this treatment may prevent/delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and CJD.",

Four cows (126 ± 4 d in milk) were investigated in a 4 × 4 Latin square and were abomasally infused with 1 of the following for 6 wk: (1) coconut oil (control treatment, CTRL; 38.3 g/d; providing saturated FA), (2) linseed and safflower oil (EFA treatment; 39.1 and 1.6 g/d, respectively; providing mainly α-linolenic acid), (3) Lutalin (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; CLA treatment; cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA, 4.6 g/d each), (4) or EFA+CLA. The initial dosage was doubled every 2 wk, resulting in 3 dosages (dosage 1, 2, and 3). Cows were fed a corn silage-based total mixed ration with a high n-6/n-3 FA ratio. Dry matter intake and milk yield were recorded daily, and milk composition was measured weekly. The FA compositions of milk fat and blood plasma were analyzed at wk 0, 2, 4, and 6. The plasma concentration and hepatic mRNA abundance of parameters linked to the antioxidative and inflammatory response were analyzed at wk 0 and 6 of each treatment period. Infused FA increased in blood plasma and milk of the respective treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner. The n-6/n-3 FA ratio in milk fat was higher in CTRL and CLA than in EFA and EFA+CLA. The sum of FA <C16 in milk fat decreased in CLA and EFA+CLA in a dosage-dependent manner. Energy-corrected milk and milk fat decreased in CLA and EFA+CLA in a dosage-dependent manner and were higher in EFA and CTRL than in CLA at dosages 2 and 3. Energy balance tended to be highest in CLA cows. Milk protein content was lower in CLA and EFA+CLA than in CTRL. Milk urea concentration decreased in CLA and EFA+CLA in a dosage-dependent manner and was lower in CLA and EFA+CLA than in EFA and CTRL at dosages 2 and 3. Milk citrate concentration increased in CLA in a dosage-dependent manner and was higher in CLA and EFA+CLA than in EFA and CTRL. Glutathione peroxidase activity in blood plasma was lower in CTRL than in EFA, and plasma concentration of β-carotene increased in EFA and EFA+CLA with dosage. Increased milk citrate pointed at reduced de novo FA synthesis and a better antioxidative status in milk due to CLA treatment. Supplementation with CLA may also affect milk protein synthesis, but EFA and CLA treatment did not influence the inflammatory status in a consistent manner in mid-lactating cows.",

This study aimed to review the association between the intake of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in the form of dietary supplement or enriched food with different treatment durations and the levels of Lp(a) and CRP in human studies. METHODS: All the articles published in Cochrane Library, ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar from November 2014 to October 2015 were searched and the clinical trials on the effects of CLA on Lp(a) and CRP levels were assessed. Of the 2249 articles initially retrieved, 21 eligible randomized clinical trials were enrolled in this systematic review. The publication dates of the eligible articles ranged from 2005 to 2013. The mean difference and the standard deviation of changes in CRP and Lp(a) levels in intervention and control groups were used as effect-size measures for meta-analysis. The obtained data from the eligible randomized controlled trials were meta-analyzed using Stata, version 13. RESULTS: The intake of CLA as a dietary supplement led to a significant increase in CRP levels (standardized mean difference [SMD]=0.41, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.54; P=0.001). Subgroup analysis based on the duration of CLA consumption showed that CLA consumption more than 24 weeks resulted in a significant increase in the levels of CRP (SMD=0.52, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.68; P=0.001) and Lp(a) (SMD=0.24, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.47; P=0.04). CONCLUSION: The current systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the long-term consumption of CLA increases the levels of CRP and Lp(a)."

As fish oil (FO) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) are known Nrf2 inducers, their protective ability is comparatively evaluated in a murine model of depression (MRL/MpJ-Faslpr ). Oxidative stress, fatty acids content, and critical factors reflecting brain functioning-namely brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic markers, and cholinergic signaling-are preliminarily evaluated in the frontal cortex of 8-week (Young) and in 22-week old animals (Old), which are used as model of depression. These markers are measured in Old mice at the end of a 5-week pretreatment with FO or CLA (728 or 650 mg kg-1 , respectively). Old mice exhibit disrupted Redox homeostasis, compensatory Nrf2 hyperactivation, lower docosaheaxaenoic acid (DHA), and lower BDNF and synaptic function proteins compared to Young mice. FO and CLA treatment relieves almost all the pathophysiological hallmarks at a level comparable to Young mice. Presented data provide the first evidence for the comparable efficacy of FO or CLA supplementation in preventing depression signs in Old MRL/lpr mice, likely through their ability of improving Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defenses.",

In one experiment, Kunming mice were separated into four groups (n = 6 per group); the control (CON) group received 3.0% linoleic acid (LA) oil, the L-CLA group received a mixture of 2.0% LA and 1.0% CLA, the M-CLA group received a mixture of 1.0% LA and a 2.0% CLA, and the H-CLA group received 3.0% CLA. Feeding proceeded from day 4 to day 10 of lactation. In a second experiment, a CON group received 3.0% LA, and an H-CLA group received 3.0% CLA. Plasma parameters were analyzed for all groups, and insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) were conducted. CLA treatment did not affect dam weight but significantly decreased the food intake of dams during lactation. Furthermore, CLA decreased the weight of pups on day 10 of lactation; this effect was attributed to lower milk fat of dams in the CLA group than in those of the other groups. Relative to mice in the CON group, the mice in the H-CLA group displayed increased liver weight and liver triglyceride (TG) content as well as higher TG content and γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) activity in the plasma. Moreover, high-dose CLA resulted in insulin resistance, possibly affecting the red blood cell (RBC) and hemoglobin (HCB) levels in the plasma. In conclusion, lactating mice receiving a high dose of CLA exhibited fatty liver, insulin resistance, and impaired lactation performance.",

METHODS: db/db mice were randomized for treatment with saline or CLA mixture administered intragastrically. The changes in body weight, dietary intake, water intake, oral glucose tolerance, triglyceride and total cholesterol were recorded after the treatments. HE staining and oil red O staining were used to assess liver pathologies and fatty acid content. The expression levels of PPARα, PPARγ, CD36, CHREBP and SREBP-1c were detected using real-time PCR and Western blotting. HepG2 cells were treated with CLA and linoleic acid and the expressions of PPARα, ACC, P-ACC, and CD36 were detected; the level of acetyl-CoA in the cell supernatant was detected using ELISA. RESULTS: CLA treatment obviously reduced the dietary and water intake of db/db mice, effectively reduced the body weight and decreased serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels (P &lt; 0.05). CLA significantly reduced fasting blood glucose, increased glucose tolerance, reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver and improved lipid metabolism in db/db mice. The mice showed significantly increased expression of PPARα (P &lt; 0.05) and lowered CD36 expression (P &lt; 0.001) in the liver after CLA treatment. Cellular experiments showed that CLA significantly up-regulated PPARα (P &lt; 0.001) and P-ACC and decreased the expression of CD36 (P &lt; 0.01). ELISA showed that acetyl-CoA was significantly up-regulated in the cells after CLA treatment (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The mixture of two conjugated linoleic acid isomers can reduce fasting blood glucose, increase glucose tolerance and improve glycolipid metabolism in db/db mice by enhancing the expression of PPARα, increasing P-ACC and inhibiting CD36 expression.",

This study aims to investigate the effect of daily supplementation of these 2 isomers on body composition and serum leptin and insulin levels in obese adults. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed on 54 adults with class I obesity. The subjects were randomly assigned into 2 groups of 27 and were followed for 3 months so that a total of 3000 mg of CLA supplement and placebo were administered in 3 daily doses in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Body composition indices as well as fasting serum levels of insulin and leptin were also measured. The paired t-test was used for evaluating within-group effects from baseline. The independent t-test was used to compare between-group differences for variables with normal distribution. RESULTS: Although body weight and body mass index (BMI) were not significantly decreased during intervention in groups, but the body fat mass (BFM) (P=0.034), body fat percentage (P=0.022) and trunk fat (P=0.027) decreased significantly during intervention with CLA. The fasting plasma sugar (P=0.042) and Homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA/IR) (P=0.044) in the intervention group declined during 12 weeks of intervention. Serum leptin was associated with a significant decrease during the intervention period (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: CLA supplementation could reduce body fat and serum leptin. Hence, it could be taken into account as a factor for weight loss but not to control or prevent diabetes.",

      "abstract": "In the critical period of neurodevelopment (gestation and lactation), maternal consumption of essential fatty acids (FAs) can alter the offspring cognitive function permanently causing damage. Lipids can regulate neurotrophin and compose brain tissue. However, the effects of maternal consumption of a mixture of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on an offspring nervous system are not completely clear. We aimed to investigate the impacts of different CLA concentrations mixed into the maternal diet during early life on neonatal reflex maturation and cognitive functions of the offspring. Three groups were formed: control (CG): receiving a standard diet; CLA1: receiving a diet containing 1% of CLA, and CLA3: receiving a diet containing 3% of CLA, offered during gestation and lactation. After birth, the reflex responses of the offspring were observed from the 1st to the 21st day. After weaning, the animals' anxiety and memory were assessed using open field (OF) and novel object recognition tests. Fatty acids in the breast milk and the offspring's brain were also quantified. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test. CLA1 presented accelerated palmar grasp disappearance versus CLA3 and negative-geotaxis versus CG; and the CLA3 presented increases for most reflexes (cliff-avoidance, vibrissa-placing, negative-geotaxis, and auditory-startle response), and decrease in reflexes palmar grasp and free-fall righting versus CG (p < 0.05). CLA3 group explored less of the OF in the second exposure. CLA1 and CLA3 presented an increased exploration ratio for new objects, which indicates memory improvement. The milk tested from CLA3 demonstrated an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and a decrease in monounsaturated fatty acids. The amount of CLA in milk was greater in CLA1 and CLA3 and in the brain offspring both presented moderated amounts of CLA. Maternal treatment with the CLA mixture induced anticipated reflex maturation and improved memory in the offspring. Even though CLA was detected in the brains in only trace amounts, offspring's brain PUFA and SFA levels were increased. Further studies aimed to delineate the effect of maternal CLA supplementation on offspring's brain lipid metabolism and long-term neurologic outcome are needed to confirm these findings."

OVAn1 and OVAn2 were obtained by heat treatment (85 °C, 5 min, pH 11.35 and 7.5, respectively). OVAn1 and OVAn2 had hydrodynamic diameters of 24.63 ± 0.04 and 92.0 ± 0.2 nm, respectively, showing no significant differences in ζ potential values (p < 0.05) at pH 7.0. CLA nanocomplexes were examined in terms of size and ζ potential at pH 3.0 and 7.0, highlighting that binding of CLA caused an increase in size for OVA and both OVA nanoparticles. Morphological characterization was performed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) finding that OVA and OVA nanoparticles had a circular shape. Also, the CLA encapsulation efficiency (EE) for OVA and OVA nanoparticles was studied, yielding EE values greater than 97% for all systems. Finally, systems were assayed for a standardized in vitro gastrointestinal digestion model considering gastric and intestinal steps. Macroscopic appearance, CSLM images and quantification of CLA retention by HPLC were evaluated after digestion. All the systems showed the formation of macroscopic aggregates both in gastric and intestinal phases, which generated a visible precipitate. In all systems, CSLM confirmed the presence of numerous undefined-form aggregates. Finally, high CLA retention (around 99%) was found for native protein and nanoparticles.",

Because conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers have been shown to inhibit transcriptional activity of SREBFs in the mammary gland, the hypothesis was tested that CLA isomers inhibit NIS expression induced by all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in MCF-7 cells through inhibiting SREBF activity. c9t11-CLA and t10c12-CLA decreased ATRA-induced NIS-mRNA expression from 1.00 (ATRA alone) to 0.80 ± 0.12 (200 μM c9t11-CLA, P < 0.05) and 0.62 ± 0.10 (200 μM t10c12-CLA, P < 0.05), NIS-protein expression from 1.00 (ATRA alone) to 0.77 ± 0.08 (200 μM c9t11-CLA, P < 0.05) and 0.63 ± 0.05 (200 μM t10c12-CLA, P < 0.05), and NIS-promoter activity from 1.00 (ATRA alone) to 0.74 ± 0.13 (200 μM c9t11-CLA, P < 0.05) and 0.76 ± 0.13 (200 μM t10c12-CLA, P < 0.05); however, c9t11-CLA and t10c12-CLA increased the mRNA levels of SREBF isoforms and their target genes. In contrast, the mRNA expression of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG) was strongly induced by ATRA alone but decreased by CLA isomers from 1.00 (ATRA alone) to 0.80 ± 0.06 (200 μM c9t11-CLA, P < 0.05) and 0.86 ± 0.06 (200 μM t10c12-CLA, P < 0.05). Overexpression of PPARγ in MCF-7 cells increased basal NIS-promoter activity, and treatment with the PPARγ ligand troglitazone stimulated ATRA-induced NIS-promoter activity. In conclusion, the results suggest that CLA isomers exert their effect on the expression of NIS by decreasing PPARG expression in MCF-7 cells.",

      "abstract": "trans-10, cis-12 Conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12-CLA) is a biohydrogenation intermediate in the rumen that inhibits mammary fatty acid de novo synthesis in lactating dairy goats. However, the underlying molecular pathways in milk-lipid metabolism affected by t10c12-CLA are not completely understood. The present study investigated the lipid-regulation mechanisms in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) in response to t10c12-CLA. Gene-expression analysis indicated sterol-regulatory-element-binding transcription factor1 ( SREBF1) and its putative target gene stearoyl-CoA desaturase ( SCD1) were down-regulated (fold changes of 0.33 ± 0.04, P < 0.05, and 0.19 ± 0.01, P < 0.01, respectively). Concentrations of cellular palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and oleic acid (C18:1) were decreased (1.12 ± 0.05 vs 1.69 ± 0.11% and 15.70 ± 0.44 vs 24.97 ± 0.82%, respectively, P < 0.01), whereas those of linoleic acid (C18:2) were increased (5.00 ± 0.14 vs 3.81 ± 0.25%, P < 0.05); the desaturation indices of C16 and C18 were decreased in response to t10c12-CLA treatment (6.90 ± 0.05 vs 8.00 ± 0.30% and 61.41 ± 0.65 vs 67.73 ± 1.33%, respectively, P < 0.05). A luciferase-activity assay indicated that deletion of the sterol-response-element (SRE) site and the nuclear-factor (NF-Y) site in the SCD1-promoter region (-511/+65 bp) suppressed the regulatory effect of t10c12-CLA. Overexpression of SREBF1 partly counteracted the inhibitory effect of t10c12-CLA on de novo fatty acid synthesis. Overall, t10c12-CLA causes an inhibition of fatty acid synthesis and desaturation and regulates SCD1 expression by affecting the binding of SREBP1 protein to the SRE and NF-Y sites.",

      "abstract": "The anti-inflammatory effects of cis-9, trans-11-conjugated linoleic acid ( cis-9, trans-11-CLA) in diverse cells have been demonstrated in recent studies. The present study was conducted to observe the anti-inflammatory effects and involved mechanisms of CLA in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) exposed to Escherichia coli. According to the gene expression of IL-6, to optimize the treatment period and dose of CLA, 50 and 100 μM CLA were chosen to pretreat the cells for a period of 48 h. BMECs were exposed to 1 × 107 /mL E. coli for 6 h (ECO group), and cells were pretreated with 50 and 100 μM CLA for 48 h followed by E. coli challenge (C50 and C100 groups). After E. coli challenge, compared with that in the CON group (control group), the gene expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6), chemokines (IL-8 and CCL-20), and antimicrobial peptide BNBD5 were increased, while the gene expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was decreased significantly; CLA reversed this inflammation effect. Pretreatment with CLA also repressed the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α from BMECs in the culture medium following E. coli challenge. Therefore, cis-9, trans-11-CLA exerted anti-inflammatory effects in BMECs. The cells that were pretreated with CLA expressed remarkably lower levels of phospho-p65, phospho-IκB, and TLR4 and a higher level of PPARγ after E. coli challenge at the gene and protein levels. Compared to that in the ECO group, the nuclear translocation of phospho-p65 was suppressed when CLA was added. Combined with the above results, 50 μM CLA showed a better anti-inflammatory effect. In conclusion, CLA can reduce inflammation caused by E. coli in bovine mammary epithelial cells, and this effect is mediated through the TLR4-NF-κB pathway and PPARγ participation.",

Few studies have been conducted exploring the role of CLA in the prevention of autoimmune diseases. These studies suggest that isomer-specific effects may be occurring; however, a direct comparison of CLAt10c12 and CLAc9t11 has yet to be conducted. A study to compare the ability of CLAt10c12 and CLAc9t11 to prevent CA and assess their effects on early inflammation was performed. DBA/1 mice were fed a semipurified diet containing 6% corn oil (CO), 5.5% CO and 0.5% CLAt10c12, or 5.5% CO and 0.5% CLAc9t11 (n = 27 per diet) starting three weeks before CA primary immunization. Effects on disease incidence and severity, anticollagen antibodies, plasma and paw cytokines, and hepatic fatty acids were measured. Arthritis incidence was reduced by a minimum of 34% in mice fed either CLA isomer compared to those fed CO diet (p = 0.06). In mice that did develop arthritis (n = 9-12 mice per treatment), CLAt10c12 reduced arthritic severity to a greater extent than CLAc9t11 and CO (p = 0.03). CLA isomer treatment attenuated the increased hepatic arachidonic acid (ARA; 20:4n-6) observed with arthritis at one-week postonset (p = 0.03), while no differences in anticollagen antibodies or cytokines were observed between dietary treatments. These results suggest that CLA isomers may be effective at preventing specific immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, in part, through modulation of the ARA cascade.",

We aimed to evaluate blood lipid profiles, oxidative stress and mitochondrial bioenergetics function in hearts of rats treated with acrolein and/or the weight-loss supplements. The animals were orally gavaged with acrolein, whey protein, conjugated linoleic acid, acrolein + whey protein or acrolein + conjugated linoleic acid for six days per week during 30 days. Acrolein caused dyslipidemia and oxidative stress in red blood cells and haert mitochondria. Moreover, it caused dysfunction in mitochondrial bioenergetics by decreasing levels of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes and ATP. Co-treatment with acrolein + whey protein and acrolein + conjugated linoleic acid ameliorated acrolein-induced oxidative stress and dysfunction in mitochondrial bioenergetics. This amelioration effect was more prominent in acrolein + conjugated linoleic acid group. Interestingly, co-treatment with acrolein + whey protein negatively affected some markers of cardiac injury such as creatinine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase and homocysteine. Conjugated linoleic acid may also cause dyslipidemia because it increased the levels of triacylglycerol, low density lipoproteins and very low density lipoproteins. In conclusion, using some weight loss supplements such as whey protein may adversely affect the biochemical parameters related to cardiovascular system.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer chemotherapy can cause side effects due to nonspecific drug delivery, low solubility and fast metabolism of drugs used in conventional therapy. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of the drugs is often reduced by the strengthening of chemoresistance, which occurs via a variety of mechanisms. Different strategies have been developed to reduce multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated gene expressions including the use of surfactants and polymers. In this study superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) functionalized with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) reduced the number and viability of cells in comparison with both untreated cells or cells treated with SPIONs alone. This cytostatic effect correlated with the increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ). The necrotic cell death induced, as a consequence, an inflammatory process, as evidenced by the decrease of the anti-inflammatory PPARα and increase of pro-inflammatory TNFα and IL-1β. PPARs were examined because CLA is one of their natural ligands. The antitumor effect observed was accompanied by a down-regulation of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which was the first important discovered efflux transporter belonging to MDR, and of ALDH3A1, an enzyme able to metabolize some drugs, reducing their effects. The down-regulation of P-gp correlated with the increase of cytokines. The ALDH3A1 decrease correlated with the increase of PPARγ. Based on these results, PPARs are molecular mediators of anti-cancer effect of SPIONs functionalized with CLA, being changes in these nuclear receptors correlated with induction of cytotoxicity and inflammation, and decreased ability of cancer cells in blocking anti-cancer drug effect.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the preventive effects of CLA on the intestinal mucositis induced by 5-FU in a murine model. METHODS: Sixty-four BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: Control (CTL), fed a standard chow diet; CLAs, fed a diet supplemented with CLA; Mucositis (5-FU), fed a standard chow diet and underwent mucositis induction and CLAs 5-FU, fed a diet supplemented with CLA and underwent mucositis induction. Mucositis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 300 mg/kg 5-FU. After 72 h, the animals were euthanized and intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, inflammatory mediators, and intestinal histology were evaluated. RESULTS: Mice in the CLAs 5-FU group showed reduced weight loss compared to those in the 5-FU group (p < 0.005). Furthermore, the results also showed that the treatment with CLA reduced intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, and biomarkers of inflammatory response besides minor damage to ZO-1 and occludin with maintenance of the integrity of the intestinal epithelium and a favorable balance between the inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that CLA reduced the adverse effects from 5-FU administration on the intestinal mucosa.",

      "abstract": "Trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been identified as an intermediate of rumen fatty acid biohydrogenation that caused milk fat depression (MFD) in the dairy cow. Previous studies in cows experiencing CLA- and diet-induced MFD have identified reduced mammary expression of the master lipogenic regulator sterol response element transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) and many of its dependent genes. To distinguish between primary mechanisms regulating milk fat synthesis and secondary adaptations to the reduction in milk fat, we conducted a time-course experiment. Eleven dairy cows received by abomasal infusion an initial priming dose of 6.25 g of CLA followed by 12.5 g/d delivered in multiple pulses per day for 5 d. Cows were milked 3×/d and mammary biopsies were obtained under basal condition (prebolus control) and 12, 30, and 120 h relative to initiation of CLA infusion. Milk fat concentration and yield decreased progressively reaching a nadir at 69 h (1.82% and 38.2 g/h) and averaged 2.03 ± 0.19% and 42.1 ± 4.10 g/h on the last day of treatment (±standard deviation). Expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were decreased at 30 and 120 h compared with control. Expression of SREBF1 and THRSP were also decreased at 30 and 120 h compared with control. Additionally, we failed to observe changes in other factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and liver × receptor β and milk fat globular membrane proteins, during CLA treatment. However, expression of milk fat globular membrane proteins were decreased after 14 d of diet-induced MFD in samples from a previous experiment, indicating a possible long-term response. The rapid decrease in lipogenic enzymes, SREBF1, and THRSP provide strong support for their transcriptional regulation as a primary mechanism of milk fat depression.",

      "abstract": "Dietary supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been proposed for weight management and to prevent gut inflammation. However, some animal studies suggest that supplementation with CLA leads to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aims of this study were to test the efficiency of CLA in preventing dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, to analyze the effects of CLA in the liver function, and to access putative liver alterations upon CLA supplementation during colitis. So, C57BL/6 mice were supplemented for 3 weeks with either control diet (AIN-G) or 1% CLA-supplemented diet. CLA content in the diet and in the liver of mice fed CLA containing diet were accessed by gas chromatography. On the first day of the third week of dietary treatment, mice received ad libitum a 1.5%-2.5% DSS solution for 7 days. Disease activity index score was evaluated; colon and liver samples were stained by hematoxylin and eosin for histopathology analysis and lamina propria cells were extracted to access the profile of innate cell infiltrate. Metabolic alterations before and after colitis induction were accessed by an open calorimetric circuit. Serum glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and alanine aminotransaminase were measured; the content of fat in liver and feces was also accessed. CLA prevented weight loss, histopathologic and macroscopic signs of colitis, and inflammatory infiltration. Mice fed CLA-supplemented without colitis induction diet developed steatosis, which was prevented in mice with colitis probably due to the higher lipid consumption as energy during gut inflammation. This result suggests that CLA is safe for use during gut inflammation but not at steady-state conditions.",

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplement as natural antioxidants on oxidative stress levels, and MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels in COPD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This clinical trial study was conducted on 90 (supplement group=45 and control group=45) COPD patients in Ardabil city, Iran, in 2015. After obtaining written consent, general information was collected from each patient using a validated and reliable questionnaire. Supplement group received 3.2 g of CLA and those in the control group were given 3.2 g of placebo for 6 weeks on a daily basis. Fasting blood samples were taken from all of the patients for testing of malondialdehyde (MDA), MMP2, and MMP9 levels at the beginning and end of the study. Data were analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, independent samples t-test, paired sample t-test, chi-square test, and ANOVA. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to mean age, smoking status, and serum level of MDA at the beginning of the study. In the supplement group, the serum level of MDA decreased significantly at the end of the 6th week compared to that in the beginning of the study (p=0.0004), while in the placebo group, the difference was found to be insignificant. The serum level of MMP9 decreased significantly in the supplement group, while in the placebo group its level increased significantly as compared to that at the beginning of the study (p<0.05). The serum levels of MMP2 indicated no significant differences between the two groups neither at the beginning nor at the end of the study. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that CLA supplementation may be helpful for COPD patients through inhibiting the production of oxidative stress and controlling MMP9 serum levels.",

These electrophilic fatty acid nitroalkene derivatives mediate pleiotropic cell signaling responses. Here, we report a systematic approach to investigate the effect of NO2-CLA on human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (hCASMC), based on the RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analysis. There were extensive differentially expressed genes in NO2-CLA vs. control (510) and NO2-CLA vs. CLA (272) treatment groups, respectively. Notably, only minimal alterations were observed in CLA vs. control conditions, indicating that the electrophilic character of NO2-CLA is requited to induce differential gene expression responses independently from native CLA. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes reveals multiple cellular processes to be affected under NO2-CLA treatment, including cell proliferation, lipid metabolism, antioxidant and inflammatory-related gene expression responses. These findings reveal that nitro-fatty acid derivatives such as NO2-CLA regulate a broad array of adaptive gene expression responses by hCASMC.",

CLA significantly increased moving speed and amplitude (the average centroid displacement over the entire track) of wild type worms compared to the LA group and these effects were dependent on aak-2 (AMPKα ortholog) and sir-2.1. Proteomics analysis showed CLA treatment influences various proteins associated in reproduction and development, translation, metabolic processes, and catabolism and proteolysis, in C. elegans. We have also confirmed the proteomics data that CLA reduced the fat accumulation via abs-1 (ATP Synthase B homolog).

Our objective was to elucidate the role of conjugated linoleic acid supplementation on leptin through a systematic review and a meta-analysis of available randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). We searched the PubMed, SCOPUS, and ISI web of science up to February2017, in English, to identify RCTs investigating the effect of CLA supplements on plasma leptin concentrations. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the efficacy of CLA on leptin concentration by using random effects. Statistical heterogeneity, study quality, meta-regression and publication bias were used based on standard methods. Nineteen RCTs (comprising 26 treatment arms) with 1045 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. Random-effect meta-analysis found a slight but not significant reduction in plasma leptin concentrations (WMD: -0.38 ng/ml, 95% CI: -1.08, 0.32, p=0.286); I2=53.24%, p=0.001), following CLA supplementation. The pooled effect size was robust and remained non-significant in the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analysis based on BMI status showed that the CLA supplementation significantly reduces leptin when used for obese subjects (WMD: -1.47 ng/ml, 95% CI: -2.15, -0.79, p<0.001) and in the subset of trials lasting<24 weeks of duration (WMD: -0.76 ng/ml, 95% CI: -1.40, -0.12, p=0.019). CLA supplementation might moderately decrease circulatory leptin levels only among obese adults for shorter than 24 weeks. Additional high-quality studies are needed to replicate our results.",

Our objective was to evaluate the contribution of fatty acid metabolites produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids by the gut microbiota in vivo to regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and steatosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: In mice with depleted n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, we observed an accumulation of trans-11,trans-13 CLA and cis-9,cis-11 conjugated linoleic acids in the liver tissue that were associated with an increased triglyceride content and expression of lipogenic genes. We used an in vitro model to evaluate the impact of these two conjugated linoleic acids on hepatic lipid metabolism. In HepG2 cells, we observed that only trans-11,trans-13 conjugated linoleic acids recapitulated triglyceride accumulation and increased lipogenic gene expression, which is a phenomenon that may implicate the nuclear factors sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). CONCLUSION: The trans-11,trans-13 conjugated linoleic acids can stimulate hepatic lipogenesis, which supports the conclusion that gut microbiota and related metabolites should be considered in the treatment of non-alcoholic liver disease.",

However, the precise impact of CLA is unclear because the decreased body fat mass is followed by an increase in insulin resistance. This study aimed to evaluate some of the consequences of a high dose of CLA in rats fed a normal low fat or a high fat diet for 30 days. Male Wistar rats were separated into 4 groups (each n = 10): Control group receiving 7% fat (soybean oil); CLA group receiving 4% soybean oil and 3% CLA mixture; animal fat (AF) group, receiving 45% fat (lard); and animal fat plus CLA (AF+CLA) group, receiving 42% lard and 3% CLA mixture. The CLA mixture contained 39.32 mole% c9,t11-CLA and 40.50 mole% t10,c12-CLA. After 30 days, both CLA groups (CLA and AF+CLA groups) developed insulin resistance, with an increase in glucose in the fasting state and in an insulin tolerance test. The CLA group had increased liver weight and percentage of saturated fatty acids in liver and adipose tissue. Feeding the high fat diet resulted in increased hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation and this was exacerbated by dietary CLA. It is concluded that a high dose of CLA mixture increases insulin resistance and exacerbates hepatic steatosis when combined with a high fat diet.",

Horses were blocked by age, sex, and BW, and randomly assigned to dietary treatments consisting of commercial concentrate offered at 1% BW (as-fed) supplemented with either 1% soybean oil (CON; n = 6), 0.5% soybean oil and 0.5% CLA (LOW; n = 5; 55% purity; Lutalin, BASF Corp., Florham Park, NJ), or 1% CLA (HIGH; n = 6) top-dressed daily. Horses were fed individually every 12 h and offered 1% BW (as-fed) coastal bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) hay daily. This study was performed in 2 phases: phase I (d 0 to d 41) determined incorporation of CLA into plasma and synovial fluid; phase II (d 42 to d 56) evaluated potential of CLA to mitigate intra-articular inflammation and alter cartilage metabolism. Blood and synovial fluid were collected at 7- and 14-d intervals, respectively, to determine fatty acid concentrations. On d 42, carpal joints within each horse were randomly assigned to receive intra-articular injections of 0.5 ng lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Escherichia coli 055:B5 or sterile lactated Ringer's solution. Synovial fluid samples were obtained at preinjection h 0 and 6, 12, 24, 168, and 336 h postinjection, and analyzed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), carboxypeptide of type II collagen (CPII), and collagenase cleavage neopeptide (C2C). Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED procedure of SAS. Horses receiving the CON diet had undetectable levels of CLA for the duration of the study. A quadratic dose response was observed in concentrations of CLA in plasma and synovial fluid (P < 0.01). A negative quadratic dose response was observed for plasma arachidonic acid (20:4) with a reduction in concentration to d 14 in HIGH horses (P = 0.04). Synovial fluid 20:4 tended to decrease in horses receiving the HIGH diet (P = 0.06). Post LPS injection, synovial PGE2 was not affected by dietary treatment (P = 0.15). Synovial C2C was lower in HIGH horses (P = 0.05), and synovial CPII tended to be greater in LOW horses than HIGH and CON horses (P = 0.10). In conclusion, dietary CLA incorporated into plasma and synovial fluid prior to LPS challenge. Dietary CLA did not influence inflammation; however, there was a reduction in cartilage degradation and an increase in cartilage regeneration.",

MTT assays and QCM™ chemotaxis 96-wells were used to test the effect of t10,c12 CLA on the proliferation and migration and invasion of cancer cells. qPCR and Western Blotting were used to determine the expression of specific factors. RNA sequencing was conducted using the Illumina platform and apoptosis was measured using a flow cytometry assay. t10,c12 CLA (IC50, 7 μM) inhibited proliferation of ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV-3 and A2780. c9,t11 CLA did not attenuate the proliferation of these cells. Transcription of 165 genes was significantly repressed and 28 genes were elevated. Genes related to ER stress, ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34 were overexpressed whereas EDEM2 and Hsp90, genes required for proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins, were downregulated upon treatment. While apoptosis was not detected, t10,c12 CLA treatment led to 9-fold increase in autophagolysosomes and higher levels of LC3-II. G1 cell cycle arrest in treated cells was correlated with phosphorylation of GSK3β and loss of β-catenin. microRNA miR184 and miR215 were upregulated. miR184 likely contributed to G1 arrest by downregulating E2F1. miR215 upregulation was correlated with increased expression of p27/Kip-1. t10,c12 CLA-mediated inhibition of invasion and migration correlated with decreased expression of PTP1b and decreased Src activation by inhibiting phosphorylation at Tyr416. Due to its ability to inhibit proliferation and migration, t10,c12 CLA should be considered for treatment of ovarian cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid with attractive biological activities. Numerous studies have been conducted on the inflammation-lowering effects of CLA in in vitro and animal models. However, the effects of CLA treatment on the inflammatory markers in humans are controversial. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on controlled clinical trials (RCT) assessing the effects of CLA supplementation on the circulating inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). SUBJECTS/METHODS: The literature search of RCTs was performed using Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases from inception to March 2017. Weighted mean differences were estimated and the pooled effect size was calculated by a random effects model. RESULTS: Of the 427 identified studies, eleven RCTs, including 420 subjects were included in the statistical analysis. Findings suggested that CLA supplementation increased blood levels of CRP by 0.89 mg/l (95% CI: 0.11, 1.68; P = 0.025) and TNF-α levels by 0.39 pg/ml (95% CI: 0.23, 0.55; P < 0.0001). However, blood IL-6 levels were marginally decreased by 0.32 pg/ml (95% CI: -0.71, 0.07; P = 0.11) following CLA supplementation. There was a significant heterogeneity for the impact of CLA on CRP and IL-6, but not TNF-α. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that CLA supplementation may increase inflammatory markers (CRP and TNF-α). There are concerns about using CLA supplementation as an anti-obesity agent among the obese population for at least a short duration.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are controversies regarding the effect of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on serum leptin. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effect of CLA on serum leptin concentrations. METHOD: Databases such as Ovid, PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and ISI databases up to January 2017 were searched. The searches included RCTs conducted among human adults, and studies on the effect of conjugated linoleic acid on serum leptin concentrations as outcome variables. The mean difference and standard deviation of leptin changes in the intervention and control groups were used as effect size measures for the meta-analysis. RESULT: Eleven trials with thirteen effect sizes were pooled in this meta-analysis. CLA supplementations could not reduce serum leptin levels significantly (-0.12 (ng/ml); 95% CI: -1.29, 1.05; P=0.837). However, the impact of CLA supplementation differed by sex and BMI status. Compared with the control group, CLA administration reduced serum leptin levels significantly in trials conducted among male (- 0.86 (ng/ml); 95% CI: -1.11, -0.62; P<0.0001) or overweight individuals (-1.37 (ng /ml); 95% CI: -2.55, -0.20; P=0.022) and lasted for less than 8 weeks (-0.90 (ng/ml); 95% CI: -1.64, -0.17; P=0.0.016). CONCLUSION: CLA supplementation might be able to decrease circulating leptin levels in studies with duration of less than 8 weeks especially among male and overweight subjects. Additional RCTs that are well controlled for energy intakes may be necessary to explain the cause of short- and long-term effects of conjugated linoleic acid. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (No. CRD42017059165).",

      "abstract": "AIM: As conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)is a potential growth promotor in newborns, the present pilot study aimed at measuring the effect of synbiotic supplementation on breast milk CLA level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty lactating mothers were randomly allocated to take either synbiotic (n = 31) or placebo (n = 29) for 30 days. Maternal anthropometric indices were measured at the onset and end of the study by standard methods and body mass index was calculated. Information on food intake was collected by using a 24 hours 24-hour recall method for 2 days and food record questionnaire for 1 day. Breast milk lipids were extracted and CLA level was quantified by gas chromatography. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the baseline mean breast milk concentrations of Fatty acids (FAs) between the synbiotic and placebo groups (p > 0.05). The CLA content of breast milk increased significantly by 58% (from 0.19 ± 0.15 to 0.30 ± 0.22 mmol/L) in the supplemented group, whereas it decrease decreased slightly but not significantly by 14% (from 0.22 ± 0.14 to 0.19 ± 0.10 mmol/L) in the placebo group. After adjustment for covariates, the CLA content of breast milk was significantly higher in the supplemented group compared with placebo group after the intervention (p = 0.03). The ratio of total n - 6:3 increased significantly over time in both groups, but was not different among groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed that supplementation of lactating women with synbiotic, resulted in increased breast milk CLA composition. Further research using different species of probiotic bacteria and analysis of maternal and infant plasma FAs would be beneficial.",

      "abstract": "The trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) causes milk fat depression by downregulating expression of genes and transcription factors involved in lipogenesis and it has been proposed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) can be inhibited by trans-10, cis-12 CLA. The PPARγ is a nuclear receptor activated by natural or synthetic ligands and promotes expression of lipogenic genes and its effect on mammary lipogenesis and the interaction with trans-10, cis-12 CLA in lactating ewes was evaluated using thiazolidinedione (TZD), a chemical PPARγ agonist. A total of 24 lactating ewes were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments for 7 days: (1) Control (5 ml/day of saline solution); (2) TZD (4 mg/kg of BW/day in 5 ml of saline solution); (3) CLA (27 g/day with 29.9% of trans-10, cis-12); (4) TZD+CLA. Compared with Control, milk fat content was not changed by TZD, but was decreased 22.3% and 20.5% by CLA and TZD+CLA treatments. In the mammary gland, TZD increased PPARγ gene expression by 174.8% and 207.8% compared with Control and TZD+CLA treatments, respectively. Conjugated linoleic acid reduced sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1 (SREBP1) gene expression 89.2% and 75.3% compared with Control and TZD+CLA, respectively, demonstrating that TZD fails to overcome CLA inhibition of SREBP1 signaling. In adipose tissue, the expression of SREBP1 and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) genes were increased by the TZD+CLA treatment, compared with the other treatments. Conjugated linoleic acid decreased milk fat concentration and expression of lipogenic genes, while TZD had no effect on milk fat concentration, expression of lipogenic enzymes or regulators in the mammary gland and failed to overcome the inhibition of these by CLA. Therefore, CLA inhibition of milk fat synthesis was independent of the PPARγ pathway in lactating dairy ewes.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) appear to be involved in many biological processes in adipose tissue. However, the specific influence on miRNAs by CLA supplementation in porcine adipose tissue remains unclear. Thus, we continuously added 1.5% CLA to the pig diet from the embryo stage to the finishing period and conducted a high-throughput sequencing approach to analyse the changes in adipose tissue miRNAs. We identified 283 known porcine miRNAs, and 14 miRNAs were differentially expressed in response to CLA treatment. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the targets of the 14 differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in the Wnt signalling pathway. The CLA treatment downregulated the gene expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, FAS, and FATP1 in both subcutaneous and abdominal fat tissues; the analysis showed that ssc-miR-21 expression was significantly correlated with PPARγ expression (p<0.05), and speculated that ssc-miR-21 might influence adipogenesis through PPARγ. In conclusion, our study analysed the miRNA profiles in porcine adipose tissues by CLA treatment, and demonstrated that miRNAs are important regulators of fat lipogenesis. This study provides valuable information for the molecular regulatory mechanism of CLA on adipose tissue."

      "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms on milk fat depression (MFD) in response to trans-10,cis-12-conjugated linoleic acid (t10,c12-CLA) supplementation in ruminants were elucidated in this research with dairy goats. A total of 30 2-year-old Xinong Saanen dairy goats [40 ± 5 days in milk (DIM)] at peak lactation stage were assigned to a 3 × 3 Latin square design (14 day treatment period, followed with 14 day washout). Three CLA treatments included (a) control, fed the basal diet only without CLA supplementation; (b) orally supplemented with 8 g/day of lipid-encapsulated CLA (low dose, CLA-1); and (c) orally supplemented with 16 g/day of lipid-encapsulated CLA (high dose, CLA-2). Expression levels of fatty acid metabolism genes in the mammary tissues were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in three goats on day 1 and the other three goats on day 14 in each group after the discontinuation of CLA treatment in the third experimental period. Dietary supplementation of CLA led to a significant decrease of milk fat compared to the control (p < 0.05). Milk fat concentrations in CLA-1 and CLA-2 groups were 2.74 and 2.42%, respectively, while the milk fat concentration in the control group was 2.99%. Decreases in short- and medium-chain fatty acids (<16 carbons) and increases in unsaturated fatty acids were observed in the CLA-2 group (p < 0.05). The desaturation indexes of C16 and C18 fatty acids were obviously increased (p < 0.01). RT-qPCR results revealed decreases of the mRNA expression levels of SREBF1, PPARG, LPL, CD36, FABP3, ACSL1, FASN, ACACA, DGAT2, TIP47, ADRP, and BTN1A1 genes in mammary glands (p < 0.05) and an increase of the SCD gene because of CLA supplementation (p < 0.05). In conclusion, t10,c12-CLA-induced MFD was possibly the result from the downregulation of genes involved in lipogenesis in goat mammary glands.",

      "abstract": "Supplementing conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is supposed to spare glucose due to the milk fat-depressing effect of the trans-10, cis-12 CLA isomer, and allows repartitioning nutrients despite an energy deficiency in early lactation. However, there is still a lack of knowledge in terms of the dynamic pattern of the glucose turnover in transition dairy cows. We hypothesized that dairy cows supplemented with CLA have an altered rate of glucose turnover and insulin sensitivity during early lactation. We conducted three consecutive hyperglycaemic clamps (HGC) in weeks -2, +2 and +4 relative to parturition in Holstein cows supplemented daily either with 70 g of lipid-encapsulated CLA (6.8 g trans-10, cis-12 and 6.6 g of the cis-9, trans-11 CLA isomer; CLA; n = 11) or with 56 g of control fat (CON; n = 11). From week -3 up to week +4 relative to parturition, milk yield and dry matter intake (DMI) were recorded daily, while body weight (BW) and milk composition were obtained once weekly. Blood samples were taken once weekly and every 30 min during the HGC. Plasma was analysed for concentrations of glucose, fatty acids (FFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol. The CLA supplementation did not affect performance and metabolic parameters except for BHB and cholesterol. Furthermore, insulin concentrations and insulin sensitivity were affected by treatment. During the HGC in early lactation, insulin response was lower and decrease in FFA and BHB greater compared with the HGC in week -2 although glucose target concentration achieved during the steady-state period was similar for all three HGC. Our findings in terms of insulin and cholesterol suggest that body reserves are preserved through CLA feeding without restraining animal's performance. Furthermore, CLA effects on cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations indicated beneficial effects on hepatic lipid export contributing to an improved efficiency of prevailing metabolites in circulation.",
