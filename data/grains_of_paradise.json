      "abstract": "Increasing adaptive thermogenesis through the activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising practical strategy for preventing obesity and related disorders. Ingestion of a single dose of 40 mg of an extract of Grains of Paradise (GP), a ginger family species, reportedly triggers BAT thermogenesis in individuals with high but not in those with low BAT activity. We hypothesized that prolonged treatment with GP might revive BAT in individuals who have lost active BAT. In the present study, we recruited 9 healthy young male volunteers with reduced BAT that was assessed by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) following 2-h cold exposure at 19ºC. The subjects ingested GP extract (40 mg/d) or placebo every day for 5 wk. Before and after the treatment with either GP or placebo, their body composition and BAT-dependent cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT)-a non-invasive index of BAT-were measured in a single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over design. Their whole-body resting energy expenditure at a thermoneutral condition remained unchanged following GP treatment. However, CIT after treatment was significantly higher in GP-treated individuals than in placebo-treated individuals. Body weight and fat-free mass did not change significantly following GP or placebo treatment. Notably, body fat percentage slightly but significantly decreased after GP treatment but not after placebo treatment. These results suggest that repeated ingestion of GP elevates adaptive thermogenesis through the re-activation of BAT, thereby reducing body fat in individuals with low BAT activity.",

      "abstract": "Background: Grains of paradise (Aframomum melegueta) K. Schum is used to flavour foods and used as memory enhancer and anti-aging in traditional African medicine. This study examine the influence of ethanolic seed extract of Aframomum melegueta (AFM) on cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine in rodents. Methods: AFM (6.25, 12.5 or 25 mg/kg, p.o.) or tacrine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered for 3 consecutive days, 1 h post-treatment on day 3, scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was given, 5 min later, cognition was evaluated in the Y-maze and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests in mice as well as the Morris water maze (MWM) paradigm in rats. Biomarkers of oxidative stress in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus of rats were evaluated after the MWM task. The antioxidant capacity of AFM was evaluated in vitro using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), nitric oxide (NO) and ferric ion reducing power (FRAP) assays. Results: Scopolamine significantly reduced (38.72%) spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze and increase in transfer latency in the EPM test on day 2, which was ameliorated by AFM (25 mg/kg; 49.86%, 71.55%, respectively) in mice. In addition, AFM prevented the spatial learning deficit induced by scopolamine in the MWM task. Similarly, scopolamine-induced oxidative-nitrosative stress was attenuated by AFM treatment, evidenced in decreased malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, restoration of glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels. Interestingly, AFM exhibited notable scavenging activities against DPPH, NO and FRAP radicals. Conclusion: These results showed that A. melegueta seed extract prevented scopolamine-induced memory impairments through enhancement of antioxidant defense systems.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Grains of Paradise (Aframomum melegueta [Roscoe] K. Schum.) seeds are used in West Africa as a remedy for variety of ailments such as stomach ache, snakebite, diarrhea and they have reported anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, the seeds contain gingerols and related compounds that may be useful against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and inflammation. AIM OF STUDY: A 28-day sub-chronic toxicity study in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats was conducted to evaluate the safety of a Grains of Paradise extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ethanolic extract of the seeds was evaluated for toxicological effect on rats. RESULTS: A dose-related increase in absolute and relative liver weights was observed in males and females dosed with 450 and 1500 mg/kg. There was a corresponding increase in alkaline phosphatase with no signs of steatosis or cirrhosis. At the same doses, there was a significant decrease in blood glucose in male rats. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that Grains of Paradise extract may be useful as a treatment for diabetes, however liver toxicity should be considered.",
