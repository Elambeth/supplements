      "abstract": "Despite numerous experimental and clinical studies in terms of novel therapeutic strategies, the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP) is still symptomatic. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of Punica-granatum L. (pomegranate) and Aronia-melanocarpa (black chokeberry) which both have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions on the treatment of AP. Thirty-two rats were divided into 4 groups: Control, AP, pomegranate, and black chokeberry groups. To create AP, L-arginine was administered intraperitoneally. The rats from the pomegranate and black chokeberry groups were administered two doses of pomegranate and black chokeberry extract orally after each L-arginine injection for 7 days. Pancreatic tissues were processed for light and electron microscopic and biochemical evaluations. L-arginine administration resulted in severe necrotic AP characterized by necrosis, apoptosis, and significant increases in serum amylase, and lipase levels as well as tissue total oxidant status (TOS) levels. Degenerated organelles, apoptotic bodies, and myelinic figures were observed by electron microscopic examination. Both pomegranate and black chokeberry had beneficial effects on the treatment of AP via decreasing total histopathological damage score, apoptosis rate, and serum and tissue TOS levels. These beneficial effects of pomegranate and black chokeberry extracts may offer compelling information that may inspire and guide the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of AP.",

      "abstract": "The structure of yeast cells, which are rich in bioactive compounds, makes them an attractive encapsulation vehicle due to their antioxidant, antibacterial, and antimutagenic properties. In this study, black chokeberry extract was encapsulated with different wall materials (maltodextrin, gum arabic, mixture of maltodextrin and gum arabic, plasmolyzed yeast, and non-plasmolyzed yeast) by freeze-drying. While the highest encapsulation efficiency was obtained with maltodextrin (98.82%), non-plasmolyzed yeast (86.58%) emerged as a viable alternative to gum arabic. The largest particle size was observed in plasmolyzed yeast microcapsules. Yeast-coated capsules exhibited a spheroidal morphology. Differential Scanning Calorimetry revealed high thermal stability for all microcapsules, with the gum arabic-coated microcapsules demonstrating the greatest stability. After the simulated gastric and intestinal fluid treatment, plasmolyzed yeast provided the highest retention, with 63.45% and 77.55% of phenolics, respectively. The highest 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activities were found in yeast microcapsules, with no significant difference between them. In 2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS•+) scavenging activity, the least loss (approximately 10%) was observed in non-plasmolyzed yeast samples after intestinal digestion. These results showed that yeast can be used as an alternative coating material in the encapsulation of phenolics, and it contributes to the bioavailability of microcapsules with its protective effect during digestion."

However, many phenolic compounds possess a low bioavailability, potentially limiting their beneficial effects. Fermentation of chokeberry has been proposed as a method to improve bioavailability, bioactive composition, sensory qualities, and nutritional value. This systematic review provides an overview of fermented chokeberry products, including compound composition, sensory attributes, and health benefits observed in in vivo and in vitro studies. While sensory evaluations highlighted diverse flavour profiles and acceptability, human intervention studies suggested potential benefits for glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide increase. Animal models indicated anti-obesity and immunomodulatory properties, while in vitro studies demonstrate antioxidant, anti-melanogenesis, and anti-diabetic effects. Despite some promising findings in human and animal trials, challenges such as participant adherence and dosing inconsistencies force further protocol improvements. Through continuous scientific research, fermented chokeberry products may emerge as functional foods contributing to human health.",

      "abstract": "Biostimulants contribute to the physiological growth of plants by enhancing the quality characteristics of fruit without harming the environment. In addition, biostimulants applied to plants strengthen nutritional efficiency, abiotic stress tolerance, and fruit biochemical traits. We investigated the effectiveness of specific organic biostimulants. Five treatments were tested: (1) control (H2O, no biostimulants); (2) Magnablue + Keyplex 350 (Mgl + Kpl350); (3) Cropobiolife + Keyplex 120 (Cpl + Kpl120); (4) Keyplex 120 (Kpl120); and (5) Magnablue + Cropobiolife + Keyplex 120 (Mgl + Cpl + Kpl120) on the mineral uptake and physiology in black chokeberry (Aronia) plants, as well as the quality of their berries. The different treatments were applied to three-year-old chokeberry plants, and the experimental process in the field lasted from May to September 2022 until the harvest of ripe fruits. Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) revealed that the fifth treatment significantly increased concentrations of P, Ca, and K. Additionally, the fifth treatment enhanced photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), water-splitting efficiency (Fv/Fo) in PSII, and the performance index (PI) of both PSI and PSII in chokeberry leaves. Improvements in photosynthesis, such as CO2 assimilation (A), transpiration (E), and water-use efficiency (A/E), were also noted under biostimulant applications. Upon harvesting the ripe fruits, part of them was placed at room temperature at 25 °C, while the rest were stored at 4 °C, RH 90% for 7 days. The cultivation with biostimulants had beneficial effects on the maintenance of flesh consistency, ascorbic acid concentration, and weight of berries at 4 and 25 °C, especially in the 5th treatment. Moreover, the total antioxidant capacity, anthocyanin concentration, and total phenols of the berries were notably higher in the third and fifth treatments compared to the control. These data suggest that selecting appropriate biostimulants can enhance plant yield and fruit quality by potentially activating secondary metabolite pathways."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Consuming antioxidant-rich foods has been associated with potential benefits in managing chronic diseases by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effects of Aronia melanocarpa (aronia berry or chokeberry) on human inflammation biomarkers and antioxidant enzymes. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science, to identify relevant studies investigating the potential effects of aronia on human inflammation biomarkers and antioxidant enzymes between April 2022 and November 2023. DATA EXTRACTION: The selection of studies followed the PRISMA guidelines, data screening was conducted by 4 independent reviewers, and data extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were performed by 2 independent reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. DATA ANALYSIS: A total of 1986 studies were screened, and 18 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in a systematic review that investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of aronia on various health parameters. These studies primarily focused on the effects of aronia on cardiometabolic diseases, performance in sport, and other health parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study examined the effects of Aronia intervention on human health outcomes using aronia juice, extract, or oven-dried powder for a period of 4 to 13 weeks. The primary health parameters considered were C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and reduced glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). The results showed that aronia had a beneficial effect on several inflammatory cytokines, including reductions in CRP, TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations, as well as elevated IL-10 levels. Moreover, positive changes have been observed in antioxidant enzyme systems, including; elevated SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activity. The findings of the presented studies provide evidence that Aronia melanocarpa may have beneficial effects on inflammatory markers.

      "abstract": "This study investigated the potential benefits of black chokeberry polyphenol (BCP) supplementation on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammatory response in RAW264.7 cells and obesity-induced colonic inflammation in a high fat diet (HFD)-fed rat model. Our findings demonstrated that BCP treatment effectively reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells and concurrently mitigated oxidative stress by modulating the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, BCP supplementation significantly ameliorated HFD-induced obesity, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced systemic inflammation in HFD-fed rats. Notably, BCP treatment suppressed the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction by regulating the mRNA and protein expression of key tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1), thereby inhibiting colonic inflammation caused by the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Additionally, BCP treatment altered the composition and function of the gut microbiota, leading to an increase in the total content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, and butyric acid. Collectively, our results highlighted the potential of BCP supplementation as a promising prebiotic strategy for treating obesity-induced colonic inflammation.",

The results showed that TAHHP and HHP significantly decreased the aerobic plate counts of aronia juice. No significant differences in terms of physicochemical properties, such as pH and total soluble solids, were observed between aronia juice treated with high pressure or thermal pasteurization treatment after 28 days of storage. TAHHP and HHP affected the colour and antioxidant characteristics of aronia juice, though to a significantly lower extent than TP. This result demonstrates that TAHHP and HHP can better maintain the original quality of aronia juice than TP. In summary, both TAHHP and HHP can maintain the microbiological safety and original quality characteristics of aronia juice. TAHHP can effectively increase the safety and duration of cold storage of aronia juice, and hence is highly useful for the juice industry.",

However, the relationship between the modulation effect of black chokeberry polyphenols on obesity and the alteration of lipid metabolism is not clearly understood. This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of the black chokeberry polyphenols (BCPs) treatment on the structure of gut microbiota, lipid metabolism, and associated mechanisms in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats. Here, we found that a high-fat diet promoted body weight gain and lipid accumulation in rats, while oral BCPs supplementation reduced body weight, liver, and white adipose tissue weight and alleviated dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in HFD-induced obese rats. In addition, BCPs supplementation prevented gut microbiota dysbiosis by increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Romboutsia, and Akkermansia and decreasing the relative abundance of Desulfovibrio and Clostridium. Furthermore, 64 lipids were identified as potential lipid biomarkers through lipidomics analysis after BCPs supplementation, especially PE (16:0/22:6), PE (18:0/22:6), PC (20:3/19:0), LysoPE (24:0), LysoPE (24:1), and LysoPC (20:0). Moreover, our studies provided new evidence that composition of gut microbiota was closely related to the alteration of lipid profiles after BCPs supplementation. Additionally, BCPs treatment could ameliorate the disorder of lipid metabolism by regulating the mRNA and protein expression of genes related to the glycerophospholipid metabolism signaling pathway in HFD-induced obese rats. The mRNA and protein expression of PPARα, CPT1α, EPT1, and LCAT were significantly altered after BCPs treatment. In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that BCPs treatment alleviated HFD-induced obesity by modulating the composition and function of gut microbiota and improving the lipid metabolism disorder via the glycerophospholipid metabolism signaling pathway."

Mixed juices were prepared from apple (A) juice and black chokeberry (BC) juice at 95:5 (ABC5), 90:10 (ABC10), 85:15 (ABC15), and 80:20 (ABC20) volumetric ratios. Comparative studies on the effect of heat treatment (90 °C, 10 min) and storage (four months, 20 °C) on the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of apple, black chokeberry, and mixed juices were carried out. The soluble solids content, titratable acidity, total phenolic, total anthocyanin and ascorbic acid content, and antioxidant activity increased while the total soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio decreased with increasing addition levels of BC juice. Mixing A juice with BC juice at 95:5 and 90:10 volumetric ratios improved the color and enhanced the palatability and general acceptability of the juice. The percentage losses of anthocyanins and polyphenols registered after heat treatment and storage increased with increasing addition levels of BC juice."

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most harmful xenobiotics to which humans are exposed, mainly by the oral route, throughout life. Preventive strategies are searched as low intoxication with this element, among others due to its prooxidative properties, can be deleterious to health and the exposure to it is continuously increasing. Recently, interest has been paid to plant raw materials with a high antioxidative potential to oppose the prooxidative properties of cadmium, such as black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa L. fruit), which is rich in polyphenolic compounds. The study was aimed at assessing whether the chokeberry extract may counteract the prooxidative impact of low-level and moderate repeated intoxication with cadmium on the sublingual salivary gland. The investigation was performed on 96 Wistar rats (females), which were treated with a 0.1% aqueous extract from chokeberries or/and a diet containing 1 or 5 mg Cd/kg for 3 and 10 months, and control animals. The intoxication with cadmium, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, attenuated the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidative potential and increased the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and total oxidative status of the sublingual salivary gland resulting in an occurrence of oxidative stress, enhancement of lipid peroxidation, and oxidative injuries of proteins in this salivary gland. The treatment with the black chokeberry extract during the intoxication with cadmium prevented this xenobiotic-caused oxidative/reductive imbalance and oxidative modifications of proteins and lipids in the salivary gland. The above results allow the conclusion that the consumption of black chokeberry products during intoxication with cadmium can prevent oxidative stress and its consequences in the sublingual salivary gland and thus counteract the unfavourable impact of this xenobiotic on the oral cavity.",

Melanocarpa Extract Extract-SAE) on clinical and biochemical parameters in patients with confirmed metabolic syndrome (MetS). This study was designed as a prospective open-label clinical case-series study with 28 days of follow-up with cases selected and followed during the period from February 1, 2018 to November 2019. The study included 143 male and female patients with MetS who were subjected to SAE. SAE supplementation significantly altered SP, BP as well as HR values. After 2 weeks, CHOL levels significantly decreased in the fMetS-DM group compared to the baseline values in this group, while the LDL levels significantly decreased in the fMetS group. Triglycerides significantly decreased only after 4 weeks of SAE treatment in diabetic groups of patients (fMetS-DM and mMetS-DM) compared to the baseline, while in non-diabetic groups this marker was not significantly altered. Increased polyphenols or SAE consumption is correlated with a positive effect on body weight, total cholesterol, low and high-density lipoproteins, blood pressure and glycemia. Increasing consumption of polyphenol-rich foods could be a promising strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk.",

The aim of this study was to isolate and purify the anthocyanins from black chokeberry by simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography, and to investigate the neuroprotective effect of SMB purified anthocyanin against Aβ-induced memory damage in rats. The parameters of the SMB process were studied and optimized. Anthocyanin extracts were identified by HPLC and UPLC-QTOF-MS, and antioxidant abilities were evaluated. The Aβ-induced animal model was established by intracerebral ventricle injection in rat brain. Through the SMB purification, anthocyanins were purified to 85%; cyanidin 3-O-galactoside and cyanidin 3-O-arabinoside were identified as the main anthocyanins by UPLC-QTOF-MS. The SMB purified anthocyanins exhibited higher DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging abilities than the crude anthocyanins extract. Furthermore, rats receiving SMB purified anthocyanins treatment (50 mg/kg) showed improved spatial memory in a Morris water maze test, as well as protection of the cells in the hippocampus against Aβ toxicity. These results demonstrate that anthocyanins could serve as antioxidant and neuroprotective agents, with potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that it is possible to prescribe exercise for neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, despite the availability of diverse scientific knowledge, the effects of exercise in this regard are still unclear. Therefore, this study attempted to investigate a substance, such as black chokeberry (Aronia melanocapa L.) that could improve the ability of the treatment and enhance the benefits of exercising in neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: The cell viability was tested with 2,3-bis[2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolim-5-carboxanilide and the cells were stained with ethidium homodimer-1 solution. The mRNA expression levels were evaluated by microarray. The active compounds of black chokeberry ethanolic extract (BCE) were analyzed by gas chromatography. The chemical shift analysis in the brain was performed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: BCE treatment decreased hydrogen peroxide-induced L6 cell death and beta amyloid induced primary neuronal cell death. Furthermore, BCE treatment significantly reduced the mRNA levels of the inflammatory factors, such as IL-1α, Cxcl13, IL36rn, Itgb2, Epha2, Slamf8, Itgb6, Kdm6b, Acvr1, Cd6, Adora3, Cd27, Gata3, Tnfrsf25, Cd40lg, Clec10a, and Slc11a1, in the primary neuronal cells. Next, we identified 16 active compounds from BCE, including D-mannitol. In vivo, BCE (administered orally at a dosage of 50 mg/kg) significantly regulated chemical shift in the brain. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that BCE can serve as a candidate for neurodegenerative disease therapy owing to its cyto-protective and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, BCE treatment is expected to prevent damage to the muscles and neurons of the athletes who continue high intensity exercise. In future studies, it would be necessary to elucidate the effects of combined BCE intake and exercise."

The study samples were fruits of black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) cv. Galicjanka. In the study, two kinds of presses-piston press and twin gear juice extractor-were used, and two raw material pretreatment methods-freezing and thawing and enzymatic liquefaction-were applied. The study showed that pressing efficiency depends on the design of press and the nature of pretreatment. The highest pressing efficiency was obtained using the twin gear juice extractor. Enzymatic liquefaction of shredded fruits significantly increased the efficiency of pressing by the piston press. The type of press and the pretreatment method used had an effect on the quality traits of the extracted juices. The highest content of soluble solids was obtained for fruits not subjected to any pretreatment and pressed using the twin gear press. The highest total phenolic content was obtained in juice extracted using the piston press from shredded fruits subjected to enzymatic treatment at 45°C. A higher total phenolic content was also a characteristic of juice obtained from fruits not subjected to any pretreatment and extracted using the twin gear press. The capacity of the black chokeberry juices for free radical quenching oscillated around the level of approximately 90%. The study showed that the application of suitable processing methods is necessary for the acquisition of products with desirable quality traits.",

The juices before and after the fermentation were analyzed with GC-FID, HPLC-DAD, and HPLC-MS. Enzyme treatment significantly increased the phenolic content in the juices by 11-50%. None of strains showed ability to ferment lingonberry juice. On the other hand, L. plantarum DSM 10492 and DSM 20174 converted all malic acid to lactic acid in sea buckthorn and chokeberry juices, respectively. Fermentation with DSM 10492 reduced the content of flavonols by 9-14% and hydroxycinnamic acids by 20-24% in chokeberry juice. Flavonol glycosides and sugars in sea buckthorn as well as anthocyanins in chokeberry remained unaffected by the fermentation.",

Computational analysis suggested that 4 anthocyanins from chokeberry fruit increased Klotho (aging-suppressor) structural stability, so we hypothesized that chokeberry anthocyanins could antiaging. To explore the effects of anthocyanins treatment on brain aging, mice treated with 15 or 30 mg/kg anthocyanins by gavage and injected D-galactose accelerated aging per day. After 8 weeks, cognitive and noncognitive components of behavior were determined. Our studies showed that anthocyanins blocked age-associated cognitive decline and response capacity in senescence accelerated mice. Furthermore, mice treated with anthocyanins-supplemented showed better balance of redox systems (SOD, GSH-PX, and MDA) in all age tests. Three major monoamines were norepinephrine, dopamine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine, and their levels were significantly increased; the levels of inflammatory cytokines (COX2, TGF-β1, and IL-1) transcription and DNA damage were decreased significantly in brains of anthocyanins treated mice compared to aged models. The DNA damage signaling pathway was also regulated with anthocyanins. Our results suggested that anthocyanins was a potential approach for maintaining thinking and memory in aging mice, possibly by regulating the balance of redox system and reducing inflammation accumulation, and the most important factor was inhibiting DNA damage.",

Total anthocyanin levels in pomace were affected mostly by enzyme treatment followed by maceration temperature. The pre-heating of the mash prior to processing increased juice yield and retention of anthocyanins in the pomace. Cold maceration of frozen berries without enzyme addition gave the highest concentrations of anthocyanins in the pomace, and both cold and hot maceration of fresh unblanched berries with enzyme the lowest.

The present study is an approach to counteract the risk factors for atherosclerosis arising in the aging process by supplementation of chokeberry juice. It employed a model of healthy adult rats monitored for a number of somatometric, serum lipidogram, and histopathological parameters, related to risk factors and their response to supplementation with antioxidant-rich chokeberry juice. The results were used to calculate different atherogenic and cardioprotective indices, and all results were compared to those of young healthy rats. Chokeberry juice proved an extremely rich source of polyphenols resulting in very high antioxidant activity. Treatment with Aronia juice significantly lowered the proatherogenic low-density lipoprotein fraction of the animals studied and led to a 16.5% decrease in their total cholesterol. Atherogenic indices in Aronia-supplemented animals clearly showed lower atherogenic risk and cardioprotective indices indicated protection of the cardiovascular system. Besides that, chokeberry juice retarded the age-related changes in the aortic wall and can be recommended as a prophylactic tool for healthy aging."

The increasing prevalence of uropathogens resistant to antimicrobial agents has stimulated interest in specific nutrients, for example, cranberries, to prevent recurring UTI. Black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa [Michx] Elliott) is a rich source of phenolics, and thus, dietary intake of black chokeberry juice may reduce the incidences of UTI requiring medical treatment. In this pilot study, we examined the frequency of medically treated UTI among residents in 6 nursing homes who were offered black chokeberry juice or a placebo during a 6-month crossover intervention. The residents were offered a placebo drink for a 3-month period followed by chokeberry juice for the next 3 months (group A) or vice versa (group B). The juice was characterized by a high content of total phenolics (715 mg gallic acid equivalent, 100 mL(-1)), including B-type procyanidins, anthocyanins, and chlorogenic acids. Daily intake of chokeberry juice was 156 mL per resident in group A (n = 110) and 89 mL per resident in group B (n = 126). Urinary tract infection comprised 55% of all medically treated infections during the study period. The results revealed no immediate reduction in the frequency of UTI or the total use of antibiotics; however, during the subsequent 3-month period of juice administration, a reduction in antibiotics toward UTI was observed in both groups. The incidence of UTI was reduced by 55% in group A and 38% in group B. No changes in other infections or in use of prophylactics were observed.",

Furthermore, anti-cancer treatments may also influence the hemostatic properties of blood platelets and plasma. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of oxidative/nitrative stress (estimated by measurements of the levels of carbonyl groups and 3-nitrotyrosine in proteins--ELISA and C-ELISA methods, respectively; lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant level--TAS) on the selected parameters of hemostatic activity of plasma (the process of fibrin polymerization and lysis) collected from breast cancer patients after surgery and after various phases of chemotherapy (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide). Subsequently, we also evaluated the level of oxidative/nitrative stress and hemostatic activity in plasma from these patients in the presence of the commercial extract of Aronia melanocarpa (Aronox®) in vitro. Patients were hospitalized in Department of Oncological Surgery and Department of Chemotherapy in Medical University of Lodz, Poland. We observed increased levels of biomarkers of oxidative/nitrative stress in plasma from patients with breast cancer (before or after surgery and after various phases of chemotherapy) in comparison to healthy group. Our further experiments demonstrated the hemostatic activity of plasma from the investigated patients differs from hemostatic properties of plasma obtained from healthy volunteers. We also recognize the existence of a relationship between oxidative stress (measured by the level of carbonyl groups) and changes of hemostasis in breast cancer patients after I and IV phases of chemotherapy. Moreover, the obtained results showed that the commercial extract from A. melanocarpa berries significantly reduced, in in vitro system, the oxidative/nitrative stress and hemostasis changes in plasma from breast cancer patients, after surgery and different phases of chemotherapy. Considering the data presented in this study, we suggest that the oxidative/nitrative stress in plasma obtained from breast cancer patients (not only before or after the surgery, but also after various phases of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy) may induce changes of hemostatic activity, which may contribute to thrombosis in these patients. Our results also suggest that the commercial extract of A. melanocarpa may be regarded as a promising new source of bioactive antioxidant natural compounds for breast cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "This report presents a complex analysis of changes proceeding in the gut, blood and internal organs of rats with induced oxidative stress, glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia after dietary supplementation with an extract from black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) fruit, that is a condensed source of polyphenols (714 mg/g), especially anthocyanin glycosides (56.6%). The disturbances mimicking those observed in metabolic syndrome were induced by a high-fructose diet and simultaneous single injection of streptozotocin (20 mg/kg). Dietary supplementation with the chokeberry fruit extract (0.2%) decreased activity of maltase and sucrase as well as increased activity of lactase in the mucosa of the small intestine. Its ingestion led also to the improvement of antioxidant status, especially, the concentration of a lipid peroxidation indicator (TBARS) in organ tissues (liver, kidney and lung) was normalized; some cholesterol-lowering and distinct hypoglycemic actions were also observed. The mechanism of glucose reduction is likely to be multifactorial, and we suggest the factors related with the decreased activity of mucosal disaccharidases important for further investigation. In conclusion, chokeberry fruit derivatives may act as a promising supplementary therapeutic option in the prevention and treatment of disorders occurring in metabolic syndrome, as well as their complications.",
