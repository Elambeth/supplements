      "abstract": "Sodium arsenite (NaAsO₂), a common environmental pollutant, negatively affects male fertility by impairing spermatogenesis, disrupting hormones, and inducing oxidative stress in testicular tissue. This study evaluated the protective effect of Senna occidentalis aqueous leaf extract (SOLAq) against NaAsO₂-induced reproductive toxicity in male Wistar rats. Twenty-five rats were randomly assigned to the five groups: Group 1 served as the control. Group 2 received NaAsO₂ (5 mg/kg) daily. Treatment groups 3 and 4 received a single daily dose of 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg of SOLAq  +  NaAsO₂ (5 mg/kg), respectively. Group 5 received Silymarin (50 mg/kg)  +   5 mg/kg of NaAsO₂. All treatments were administered orally for 28 days. Rat treated with only NaAsO₂ had a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in sperm concentration, motility, and viability besides a significant increase in immotile and morphologically abnormal spermatozoa and an increase in the MDA level together with a significant decrease in CAT, SOD, and GSH activity. Also, NaAsO₂ suppresses hormonal levels of FSH, LH and testosterone and affects testicular histopathological alterations. SOLAq co-treatment alleviated these effects by enhancing the antioxidant status, improving the sperm characteristics, normalizing hormonal profile, and maintaining testicular tissue structure in a dose-dependent manner."

      "abstract": "Botanical extracts are recognized in traditional medicine for their therapeutic potential and safety standards. Botanical extracts are viable and sustainable alternatives to synthetic drugs, being essential in drug discovery for various diseases. Senna septemtrionalis (Viv.) H.S. Irwin & Barneby is a medical plant traditionally used to treat inflammation. However, its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and the molecular pathways activated in microglial cells require further investigation. Therefore, this study examines the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Senna septemtrionalis (Viv.) H.S. Irwin & Barneby methanol extracts (SMEs) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse microglial cells. SMEs significantly inhibit LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokine production, which are mediated through the dephosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) translocation into the nucleus. Additionally, SME treatment upregulated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase (HO)-1, reducing oxidative stress, indicated by a decrease in reactive oxygen species and restoration of the total glutathione content in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. The inhibitory effects of SMEs on inflammatory mediator production and NF-κB nuclear translocation were significantly reversed by Sn-protoporphyrin, a specific HO-1 inhibitor. These findings demonstrate that SME protects microglial cells by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and inhibiting NF-κB translocation.",

      "abstract": "Senna siamea (Lam.) H.S. Irwin & Barneby is used in Thai cuisine. This plant is also used in traditional treatments, including diabetes. Therefore, this study aims to examine the antihyperglycemic effects of S. siamea heartwood extract. The ethanolic extract of S. siamea heartwood exhibited activity against α-glucosidase enzyme with IC50 values of 54.4 μg/mL. Moreover, S. siamea extract (250-1000 mg/kg BW) was tested using normal rats with and without sucrose of 3 g/kg BW administration. The results showed that all extract concentrations significantly reduced fasting blood glucose compared with the control. In addition, results also agreed with the amount of sucrose in the small intestine of rats. In the acute toxicity study, a single dose of the S. siamea extract at 2000 mg/kg BW caused no mortality, and hematological and biochemical parameters also revealed no toxic effects of the extract on rats. The subchronic toxicity study, administration of the extract for 90 days, at 250 mg/kg BW, caused no significant changes in the hematological and biochemical parameters of rats in the treated groups compared with the control group. However, histopathology of the liver and kidney indicated an inflammatory response at 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of the extract, correlating to hematological and biochemical findings. Finally, molecular docking was conducted to evaluate theoretical interactions between three main stilbenes previously found in S. siamea extract and mammalian α-glucosidases (Wistar rat and human). The simulation supported the in vivo study and suggested the potential for human glucosidase inhibition. Therefore, S. siamea could be a promising candidate against α-glucosidase. This study offers encouraging information on the potential of natural compounds from S. siamea to act as α-glucosidase inhibitors for diabetes treatment through drug development or dietary supplement for hyperglycemia individuals."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amongst all neoplastic diseases, breast cancer represents a major cause of death among the female population in developed and developing countries. Since alkaloid drugs are commonly used in chemotherapy to manage this disease, this study investigated the anti-proliferative effectiveness of alkaloid-rich fractions of Senna didymobotrya leaves only and with laser irradiation against MCF-7 breast cancer cells. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A powdered sample of the plant leaves was extracted with 50% ethanol, filtered and their pH was adjusted with acid and base solution followed by partitioning with chloroform and ethyl acetate solvents. Cells were treated with 240 μg/mL of the respective extracts, while those in the photodynamic therapy groups, cells were exposed to laser (405 nm wavelength and 10 Jcm-2) irradiation 6 h post extracts' administration. RESULTS: Treatment with the S. didymobotrya leaves alkaloid extracts significantly decreased the ATP concentration and overall viability of the MCF-7 cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cell groups treated with the extracts and laser light were considerably higher than in experimental groups treated with only the extracts. Moreover, the molecular docking analysis revealed the involvement of only hydrophobic bonds in the interactions of the plant's alkaloid-derived phytoconstituents' with selected cancer protein biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Although the in silico analysis suggests that the plant-identified alkaloid phytoconstituents inhibition of estrogen receptor-alpha, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 and progesterone receptor proteins involved in breast cancer pathogenesis could explain a possible mechanism for the observed anticancer effect, more detailed in vitro molecular experiments are necessary to confirm these findings.",

This study established an acute diarrhea mouse model using senna leaf decoction and evaluated the therapeutic effects of LMGM by monitoring diarrhea scores, loose stool prevalence, intestinal tissue pathology and gene expression, and gut microbiota composition and metabolisms. The results indicated that LMGM significantly reduced diarrhea scores and loose stool prevalence within two hours post-treatment. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that LMGM improved intestinal epithelial structure and up-regulated the expression of zonula occludens 1, occludin, mucin 2, aquaporin 3, and aquaporin 4 in ileum, jejunum, and colon tissues. Moreover, LMGM increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillaceae and Lachnospiraceae, and decreased Prevotellaceae in the cecum. Furthermore, LMGM promoted short-chain fatty acid production and reduced ammonia nitrogen and skatole concentrations in the intestinal content. The study suggests that LMGM could serve as a functional prebiotic for diarrhea alleviation, potentially by enhancing the intestinal barrier, modulating water transportation, and regulating the microbiota composition.",

Nanotechnology offers innovative methods for targeted BC therapy, and this study explores the use of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) for delivering the senna leaf extract. The study evaluated the effects of increasing dosages of senna leaf extract conjugated to SWCNTs on MCF-7 cells. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay, while Giemsa staining revealed morphological changes. Additionally, the comet assay and agarose gel electrophoresis were employed to evaluate the pro-apoptotic potential. The potential of mitochondrial membrane and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were investigated using the JC-1 dye. The results indicated that treated cells exhibited apoptotic characteristics, including elevated ROS levels and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. In summary, the application of nanotechnology to deliver the senna leaf extract shows promise as a herbal treatment for BC, suggesting a potential breakthrough in combating this widespread and deadly disease."

In this study, we applied exogenous MeJA onto Senna tora leaves subjected to wounding and conducted a transcriptome deep sequencing analysis at 1 (T1), 3 (T3), 6 (T6), and 24 (T24) h after MeJA induction, along with the pretreatment control at 0 h (T0). Out of 18,883 mapped genes, we identified 10,048 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the T0 time point and at least one of the four treatment times. We detected the most DEGs at T3, followed by T6, T1, and T24. We observed the upregulation of genes related to JA biosynthesis upon exogenous MeJA application. Similarly, transcript levels of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis increased after MeJA application and tended to reach their maximum at T6. In agreement, the flavonols kaempferol and quercetin reached their highest accumulation at T24, whereas the levels of the anthraquinones aloe-emodin, emodin, and citreorosein remained constant until T24. This study highlights an increase in flavonoid biosynthesis following both MeJA application and mechanical wounding, whereas no significant influence is observed on anthraquinone biosynthesis. These results provide insights into the distinct regulatory pathways of flavonoid and anthraquinone biosynthesis in response to MeJA and mechanical wounding."

      "abstract": "Senna rugosa is a species found in the Cerrado and used in folk medicine as a vermifuge and in the treatment of poisonous snakebites accidents. In this work, we identified the main secondary metabolites present in ethanolic extracts of the leaves (ELSR) and roots (ERSR) of S. rugosa and evaluated the potential cytoprotective effect against cellular macromolecular damage, as well as the cytotoxic properties of the extracts on the K562 and Jurkat leukemic cell lines. The identification of metabolites was carried out by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The antioxidant activities were investigated by direct ABTS•+ and DPPH• radical scavenging methods, protection against oxidative damage in proteins, and DNA. Cytotoxic properties were investigated against healthy cells, isolated from human peripheral blood (PBMC) and leukemic cell lines. The leaf extracts contained catechin, rutin, epigallocatechin derivatives, kaempferol glycosides, luteolin, and dimeric and trimeric procyanidins, while the root extract profile showed obtusichromoneside derivatives, 2-methoxystypandrone, stilbene derivatives, naphthopyranones, and flavanone derivatives. The extracts showed antioxidant activity, with an IC50 of 4.86 ± 0.51 μg/mL and 8.33 ± 0.90 μg/mL in the ABTS assay for ELSR and ERSR, respectively. Furthermore, in the DPPH• assay, the IC50 was 19.98 ± 1.96 μg/mL for ELSR and 13.37 ± 1.05 μg/mL for ERSR. The extracts protected macromolecules against oxidative damage at concentrations of 5 μg/mL. The cytotoxicity test against leukemic strains was observed after 24 and 48 h of treatment. After 48 h, results against the K562 cell line demonstrate an IC50 of 242.54 ± 2.38 μg/mL and 223.00 ± 2.34 μg/mL for ELSR and ERSR, respectively. While against the Jurkat cell line, these extracts showed an IC50 of 171.45 ± 2.25 μg/mL and 189.30 ± 2.27 μg/mL, respectively. The results pertaining to PBMC viability demonstrated that the extracts showed selectivity for the leukemic cell lines. Together, our results reveal that the leaves and roots of S. rugosa have completely distinct and complex chemical compositions and expand their significant pharmacological potential in oxidative stress and leukemia conditions."

A novel procedure for synthesizing ZnO-TiO2/RGO NCs has been developed using Senna surattensis extract. The improved physicochemical properties of the obtained samples were investigated using different techniques such as XRD, TEM, SEM, XPS, FTIR, DLS and UV-visible spectroscopy. XRD results showed that the addition of ZnO and RGO sheets affects the crystal structure and phase of TiO2 NPs. SEM and TEM images displayed that the TiO2 NPs and ZnO NPs were small with uniform spherical morphology in the prepared ZnO-TiO2/RGO NCs. Besides, it is shown that ZnO-TiO2 NCs anchored onto the surface of RGO sheets with a particle size of 14.80 ± 0.5 nm. XPS data confirmed the surface chemical composition and oxidation states of ZnO-TiO2/RGO NCs. Functional groups of prepared NPs and NCs were determined using FTIR spectroscopy. DLS data confirmed that the addition of ZnO and RGO sheets improves the negative surface charge of the prepared pure TiO2 NPs (-22.51 mV), ZnO NPs (-18.27 mV), ZnO-TiO2 NCs (-30.20 mV), and ZnO-TiO2/RGO NCs (-33.77 mV). Optical analysis exhibited that the bandgap energies of TiO2 NPs (3.30 eV), ZnO NPs (3.33 eV), ZnO-TiO2 NCs (3.03 eV), and ZnO-TiO2/RGO NCs (2.78 eV) were further enhanced by adding ZnO NPs and RGO sheets. This indicates that the synthesized samples can be applied to cancer therapy and environmental remediation. The biological data demonstrated that the produced ZnO-TiO2/RGO NCs show a more cytotoxic effect on HCT116 cells compared to pure TiO2 NPs and ZnO-TiO2 NCs. On the other hand, these NCs displayed the lowest level of toxicity towards normal HUVCE cells. These results indicate that the ZnO-TiO2/RGO NCs have strong toxicity against HCT116 cells and are compatible with normal cells. Our results show that the plant extract enhanced the physicochemical properties of NPs and NCs compared with the traditional chemical methods for synthesis. This study could open new avenues for developing more effective and targeted cancer treatments."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Pancreatic cancer (PC) presents challenges due to limited treatment options and patients seek complementary therapies alongside conventional treatments to improve well-being. This study uses computational drug discovery approaches to find potential phytochemicals from S. singueana for PC treatment. Among the 38 phytochemicals screened from S. singueana, specific inhibitors against PC were selected. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis highlighted key targets with high degrees, including PTEN (8) and PTK2 (7) genes, along with their respective proteins 5BZX and 3BZ3, which were employed for molecular docking studies. 1-methylchrysene and 3-methyl-1,8,9-anthracenetriol showed strong binding affinities of - 9.2 and - 8.1 Kcal/mol, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations lasting 300 ns assessed structural stability and interaction energy of compound-target dockings: 1-methylchrysene-PTEN and 3-methyl-1,8,9-anthracenetriol-PTK2. In molecular dynamics simulations, the 3-methyl-1,8,9-anthracenetriol-PTK2 complex showed lower RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, and more hydrogen bonds than the 1-methylchrysene-PTEN complex. The 3-methyl-1,8,9-anthracenetriol-PTK2 complex exhibited significantly stronger binding with a binding free energy (ΔG) of - 21.92 kcal/mol compared to the less favourable ΔG of - 10.65 kcal/mol for the 1-methylchrysene-PTEN complex. The consistent and stable binding interaction observed in the 3-methyl-1,8,9-anthracenetriol-PTK2 complex highlights its potential as a potent inhibitor of Focal Adhesion Kinase 1. Consequently, it emerges as a promising lead compound for the development of pancreatic cancer therapeutics. Conversely, the fluctuations observed in the 1-methylchrysene-PTEN complex indicate a less stable binding interaction. This indicates the potential of 3-methyl-1,8,9-anthracenetriol as a primary candidate for pancreatic cancer treatment. These findings improve our grasp of S. singueana's multi-target effects and its promise in addressing pancreatic cancer. Nevertheless, additional in-vivo and in-vitro studies are required to validate their effectiveness and therapeutic potential.

Using native epiphytic yeast to control phytopathogens is a successful strategy for managing plant diseases. In the present investigation, we exploited the antagonistic potential of epiphytic yeast isolates obtained from senna against A. flavus growth and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production. Four Kluyveromyces marxianus strains (YSL3, YSL16, YSP12, and YSF9) exhibited vigorous antagonistic activity with a maximum inhibition of 64 %. In vivo evaluation of senna pods showed that K. marxianus strains effectively reduced A. flavus colonization with a population range of 5.87 to 7.08 log10 CFU/g. In contrast, the untreated senna pods were found to have severe fungal colonization with a population of 7.84 log10 CFU/g. In addition, HPLC analysis showed that aflatoxin B1 in senna pods was drastically reduced upon yeast treatment up to 14 DAI. Furthermore, we demonstrated the antifungal action mechanisms of K. marxianus, such as surface colonizing ability on pods, production of antifungal volatiles (VOCs), siderophores, extracellular lytic enzymes, and cell wall binding ability to AFB1. All four strains of K. marxianus showed rapid colonization on the senna pod, and YSP12 reached the maximum population of 7.18 log10 CFU/pod at 9 days after inoculation (DAI). The exposure of A. flavus to K. marxianus VOCs significantly reduced the growth by up to 99 and 93.2 % at 7 and 14 DAI, respectively. Scanning electron microscopic images demonstrated severe mycelial damage and hyphal deformities of A. flavus. In addition, yeast VOCs can reduce aflatoxin biosynthesis in A. flavus by up to 99 and 93.2 % at 7 and 14 DAI, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of antimicrobial compounds such as dimethyl trisulfide, ethyl acetate, ethanol, 3-methyl butanal, 2-methyl-1-butanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol in the volatiles. K. marxianus strains produced siderophores and hydrolytic enzymes such as chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase. A higher AFB1 binding ability was observed in the heat-killed cells (47.5 to 70.65 %) than in the viable cells (43.16 to 60.98 %) of K. marxianus. The current study demonstrated that epiphytic K. marxianus isolated from senna could be a successful biocontrol source to reduce aflatoxin contamination in senna pods."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: In China, herbal preparation is commonly administered transdermally for treating pediatric diarrhea. However, few studies have probed into their antidiarrheal mechanisms. This study was designed to investigate the antidiarrheal effect of Renzhu ointment (Renzhuqigao, RZQG) and its underlying mechanisms via transdermal administration. METHODS: The main components of RZQG were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The effect of RZQG on L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (L-VDCC) was evaluated by CaCl2- and ACh-induced contraction in isolated colon. The antidiarrheal efficacy of RZQG was further investigated by the senna-induced diarrhea mice based on the frequency of loose stools, diarrhea rate and index, fecal moisture content, and the basal tension of the colon. Additionally, the protein expression of CACNA1C, CACNA1D, cAMP, and PKA were detected with Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: GC-MS analysis determined 14 components in RZQG. In vitro, RZQG relaxed the CaCl2- and ACh-induced tension, while nifedipine (a L-VDCC inhibitor) and H-89 (a PKA inhibitor) decreased the relaxation. In vivo, animal model showed that transdermal administration of RZQG exhibited a significant reduction in the frequency of loose stools, diarrhea rate and index, fecal moisture content and the basal tension. Compared to the model group, the colon of mice treated with RZQG showed lower expression of CACNA1C, CACNA1D, cAMP, and PKA. IHC results showed that cAMP was downregulated in colonic smooth muscle after RZQG treatment. CONCLUSION: RZQG improved diarrhea symptoms and down-regulated the expression of CACNA1C and CACNA1D via transdermal administration, which is closely associated with the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in colonic smooth muscle.",

In addition, we sought to evaluate the anticancer potential of this molecule against melanoma and leukemic cell lines and identify the pathways of cell death involved. To this end, a novel anthraquinone was isolated from the barks of the roots of S. velutina, analyzed by HPLC-DAD, and its molecular structure was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Subsequently, their cytotoxic activity was evaluated by the (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method against non-cancerous, melanoma, and leukemic cells. The migration of melanoma cells was evaluated by the scratch assay. The apoptosis process, caspase-3 activation, analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential, and measurement of ROS were evaluated by flow cytometry technique. In addition, the pharmacological cell death inhibitors NEC-1, RIP-1, BAPTA, Z-VAD, and Z-DEVD were used to confirm the related cell death mechanisms. With the results, it was possible to elucidate the novel compound characterized as 2'-OH-Torosaol I. In normal cells, the compound showed no cytotoxicity in PBMC but reduced the cell viability of all melanoma and leukemic cell lines evaluated. 2'-OH-Torosaol I inhibited chemotaxis of B16F10-Nex2, SK-Mel-19, SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-103. The cytotoxicity of the compound was induced by apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, and activation of caspase-3. In addition, the inhibitors demonstrated the involvement of necroptosis and Ca2+ in the death process and confirmed caspase-dependent apoptosis death as one of the main programmed cell death pathways induced by 2'-OH-Torosaol I. Taken together, the data characterize the novel anthraquinone 2'-OH-Torosaol I, demonstrating its anticancer activity and potential application in cancer therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Senna occidentalis (L.) Link has been used worldwide in traditional treatment of many diseases and conditions including snakebite. In Kenya, a decoction from the plant roots taken orally, is used as a cure for malaria. Several studies have demonstrated that extracts from the plant possess antiplasmodial activity, in vitro. However, the safety and curative potency of the plant root against established malaria infection is yet to be scientifically validated, in vivo. On the other hand, there are reports on variation in bioactivity of extracts obtained from this plant species, depending on the plant part used and place of origin among other factors. In this study, we demonstrated the antiplasmodial activity of Senna occidentalis roots extract in vitro, and in mice. METHODS: Methanol, ethyl acetate, chloroform, hexane and water extracts of S. occidentalis root were tested for in vitro antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium falciparum, strain 3D7. Cytotoxicity of the most active solvent extracts was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the curative potency in Plasmodium berghei infected mice evaluated by Rane's test. RESULTS: All of the solvent extracts tested in this study inhibited the propagation of P. falciparum, strain 3D7, in vitro, with polar extracts being more active than non-polar ones. Methanolic extracts had the highest activity (IC50 = 1.76) while hexane extract displayed the lowest activity (IC50 = 18.47). At the tested concentrations, methanolic and aqueous extracts exhibited high selectivity index against P. falciparum strain 3D7 (SI > 10) in the cytotoxicity assay. Further, the extracts significantly suppressed the propagation of P. berghei parasites (P < 0.05) in vivo and increased the survival time of the infected mice (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Senna occidentalis (L.) Link root extract inhibits the propagation of malaria parasites in vitro and in BALB/c mice.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Senna petersiana (Bolle) is a native South African medicinal shrub combined locally with other plant products to manage diabetes or used as a single therapy for several other ailing conditions. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study evaluated the antidiabetic and antilipidemic effects of S. petersiana leaf ethanol extract and its modulatory effects on dysregulated enzyme activities in fructose-fed streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six groups of 6-weeks old male Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study. Diabetes was induced in four of the groups by injecting (i.p.) 40 mg/kg of streptozotocin after a two-weeks feeding of 10% fructose via drinking water, while animals in the two normal groups were given similar volume of vehicle buffer and normal drinking water, respectively. After the confirmation of diabetes, treatment with 150 and 300 mg/kg body weight of the ethanolic leaf extract of S. petersiana proceeded for a period of 6 weeks. RESULTS: Oral administration of S. petersiana leaf extract significantly lowered blood glucose, food and liquid intake, glycosylhaemoglobin in blood, liver and cardiac biomarkers, and lipid profile in serum and atherogenic index (AIP) in both the low and high-dose treated animal groups. This was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in Homeostatic Model Assessment-beta (HOMA-β) score, serum high-density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-c), and insulin levels. It also improved pancreatic and serum-reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes activities with a simultaneous reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations. Moreover, the extract modulated dysregulated α-amylase, lipase, cholinesterase, and 5' nucleotidase enzyme activities in pancreatic tissue as well as glycogen metabolism in the liver. Analysis of the phytochemicals in the S. petersiana extract showed the presence of phytol, 4a,7,7,10a-tetramethyldodecahydrobenzo[f]-chromen-3-ol, phytol acetate, solasodine glucoside, cassine, veratramine and solasodine acetate. Amongst these compounds, solasodine glucoside had the best binding energy (ΔG) with the selected diabetes-linked enzymes via molecular docking simulation. CONCLUSION: Data from this study demonstrate the antidiabetic effects of S. petersiana leaf extract via the modulation of the dysregulated indices involved in type 2 diabetes and its associated complications. Although it has been shown safe in animals, further toxicological studies are required to ensure its safety for diabetes management in humans.",

DED is not a life-threatening disease but causes discomfort and multifactorial disorders in vision that affect daily life. It has been reported that all traditional medicinal plants exhibit anti-inflammatory effects on several diseases. We hypothesized that the decoction ameliorated ocular irritation and decreased cytokine expression in the cornea. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of DED and discover a therapeutic strategy to reduce corneal inflammation. Material and Methods: We used a DED mouse model with extraorbital lacrimal gland (ELG) excision and treated the mice with a decoction of five traditional medicines: Lycium chinense, Cuscuta chinensis, Senna tora, Ophiopogon japonicus, and Dendrobium nobile for 3 months. The tear osmolarity and the ocular surface staining were evaluated as indicators of DED. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the level of inflammation on the cornea. Results: After treatment with the decoction for three months, epithelial erosions and desquamation were reduced, the intact of corneal endothelium was maintained, and tear osmolarity was restored in the eyes. The IL-1β-associated inflammatory response was reduced in the cornea in the DED model. Conclusions: These data suggested that a mixture of traditional medicines might be a novel therapy to treat DED.",

Results of the phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, tannins, terpenoids, saponins, steroids and cardiac glycosides. Total phenolic and flavonoid content was estimated to be 45.29 ± 2.34 mg GAE/g and 25.22 ± 2.26 mg QE/g respectively. In vitro analysis of the extract also confirmed its antioxidant property. Results of the test for prophylaxis of P. berghei indicated that SAE suppressed parasitemia significantly in treated groups in a dose dependent manner when compared with negative control group. Similarly, SAE improved the mean survival time (MST) and packed cell volume (PCV) of infected mice. The test for curative effect showed that SAE significantly suppressed parasitemia to 4.50 ± 1.05% compared to untreated group 29.83 ± 3.49%. Results of liver and kidney functions indices of treated animals indicated that whereas infection with P. berghei caused increase in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, urea and creatinine, treatment with SAE significantly reversed the perturbation. Similarly, infected mice were dyslipidemic with concomitant increased activity of HMG CoA reductase and decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes with increase in lipid peroxides levels. However, these alterations were significantly reversed by administration of SAE. Results of this study shows that Senna alata possess antimalarial activity and therefore justify the traditional use of plant for the treatment of malaria.",

      "abstract": "Bacillus natto is a kind of probiotic with various functional characteristics, which can produce a lot of nutrients during growth and reproduction. Bacillus natto was used as strain, the number of viable bacteria and the content of soluble dietary fiber in millet bran were used as indexes to study the effects of inoculum size, fermentation time, and fermentation temperature on the fermentation effect, and the optimal fermentation conditions were determined by a response surface experiment. The antidiarrhea effect of fermented millet bran prepared under the best technological conditions was evaluated. The results showed that the optimum fermentation conditions were as follows: inoculum size was 7.48%, fermentation time was 47.04 h, and fermentation temperature was 36.06 °C. Under the optimal fermentation conditions, the viable bacteria count of millet bran was 8.03 log CFU/mL and the soluble dietary fiber content was 12.14%. The fermented millet bran can significantly reduce the intestinal thrust rate and serum levels of IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α, and significantly increase the secretion of SIgA in the intestinal mucosa, which can relieve diarrhea induced by senna leaf in mice. The results of this study can provide the scientific basis for deep processing of millet bran and efficient utilization of fermented millet bran, and also provide the theoretical basis for clinical treatment of diarrhea."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chikungunya fever is an endemic disease caused by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). To date there is no antiviral treatment against this infection or licensed vaccine to prevent it. Our study aims to evaluate whether (-)-cassine (1) and (-)-spectaline (2), the main alkaloids of Senna spectabilis, display anti-CHIKV activity. Both compounds have been described to be biologically active against neglected tropical diseases, including malaria, leishmaniasis, and schistosomiasis, which emphasizes that these molecules could be repurposed for chikungunya fever treatment. METHODS: The structures of the isolated compounds 1 and 2 were identified by NMR and HRESIMS analyses, and their antiviral activity against CHIKV was assessed by a dose-response assay employing BHK-21 cells and CHIKV-nanoluc, a recombinant virus carrying the nanoluciferase gene reporter. RESULTS: Compound 1 presented CC50 of 126.5 µM and EC50 of 14.9 µM, while compound 2 presented CC50 of 91.9 µM and EC50 of 8.3 µM. The calculated selectivity index (SI) was 8.5 for 1 and 11.3 for 2. CONCLUSION: The data presented herein show that compounds 1 and 2 have potential for being repurposed as anti-CHIKV drug. Our promising in vitro results encourage further in vitro and in vivo assays. This is the first description of the antiviral activity of compounds 1 and 2 against CHIKV infection, which can impact the development of antiviral drug candidates against chikungunya fever, which sometimes can be debilitating.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the binding potential of chemical compounds of Senna in comparison with the experimentally tested active phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2 protein targets to assist in prevention of infection by exploring multiple treatment options. The entire set of phytochemicals from both the groups were subjected to advanced computational analysis that explored functional molecular descriptors from a set of known medicinal-based active therapeutics followed by MD simulations on multiple SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. Our findings manifest the importance of hydrophobic substituents in chemical structures of potential inhibitors through cross-validation with the FDA-approved anti-3CLpro drugs. Noteworthy improvement in end-point binding free energies and pharmacokinetic profiles of the proposed compounds was perceived in comparison to the control drug, vizimpro. Moreover, the identification of common drug targets namely; AKT1, PTGS1, TNF, and DPP4 between proposed active phytochemicals and Covid19 using network pharmacological analysis further substantiate the importance of medicinal scaffolds. The structural dynamics and binding affinities of phytochemical compounds xanthoangelol_E, hesperetin, and beta-sitosterol reported as highly potential against 3CLpro in cell-based and cell-free assays are consistent with the computational analysis. Whereas, the secondary metabolites such as sennosides A, B, C, D present in higher amount in Senna exhibited weak binding affinity and instability against the spike protein, helicase nsp13, RdRp nsp12, and 3CLpro. In conclusion, the results contravene fallacious efficacy claims of Senna tea interventions circulating on electronic/social media as Covid19 cure; thus emphasizing the importance of well-examined standardized data of the natural products in hand; thereby preventing unnecessary deaths under pandemic hit situations worldwide.",

      "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is an etiologic agent responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The virus has rapidly extended globally and taken millions of lives due to the unavailability of therapeutics candidates against the virus. Till now, no specific drug candidates have been developed that can prevent or treat infections caused by the pathogen. The main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and mechanistically inhibition of the protein can hinder the replication and infection process of the virus. Therefore, the study aimed to identify the natural bioactive compounds against the virus that can block the activity of the Mpro and subsequently block viral infections. Initially, a total of 96 phytochemicals from Ruellia prostrata Poir. and Senna tora (L.) Roxb. plants were identified through the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analytical method. Subsequently, the compounds were screened through molecular docking, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), toxicity (T), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. The molecular docking method initially identified four molecules having a PubChem CID: 70825, CID: 25247358, CID: 54685836 and, CID: 1983 with a binding affinity ranging between -6.067 to -6.53 kcal mol-1 to the active site of the target protein. All the selected compounds exhibit good pharmacokinetics and toxicity properties. Finally, the four compounds were further evaluated based on the MD simulation methods that confirmed the binding stability of the compounds to the targeted protein. The computational approaches identified the best four compounds CID: 70825, CID: 25247358, CID: 54685836 and, CID: 1983 that can be developed as a treatment option of SARS-CoV-2 disease-related complications. Although, experimental validation is suggested for further evaluation of the work."

      "abstract": "Senna obtusifolia is a famous medicinal plant that is widely used in Asian countries. Its seed plays an important role in the treatment of many diseases because it contains various anthraquinones and flavonoids. Our previous studies have indicated that three space environment-induced S. obtusifolia lines (SP-lines) i.e., QC10, QC29, and QC46, have higher seed yield and aurantio-obtusin (AO) content. However, the underlying mechanism of higher AO content in SP-lines is still unknown. Herein, transcriptome sequencing and HPLC were employed to analyze the differences between SP-lines and ground control (GC3) and elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of AO accumulation in SP-lines. The results show that 4002 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in SP-lines versus (vs.) GC3. DEGs in the QC10 vs. GC3, QC29 vs. GC3, and QC46 vs. GC3 comparisons were classified into 28, 36, and 81 GO terms and involved in 63, 74, and 107 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. KEGG pathway and gene expression analysis revealed that DEGs involved in anthraquinone pathways were significantly elevated in QC10 and QC46. Integrating the results of GO annotation, KEGG enrichment, and gene expression analysis, we propose that the elevated genes such as DAHPS, DHQS, and MenB enhance the metabolic flux in the anthraquinone pathway and promote AO content in QC10 and QC46. Taken together, this study elucidated the mechanism of AO content in SP-lines and provides valuable genetic information for S. obtusifolia. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first transcriptome analysis of environment-induced medicinal plants and paves the way to select elite S. obtusifolia varieties in the future.",

It is mainly used in Ayurvedic medicine in India. Several parts of this plant are used for preventing or treating diabetes, haematuria, rheumatism, typhoid, asthma, hepatotoxicity, disorders of haemoglobin and leprosy. AIM OF THE STUDY: This review outlines the pharmacological evidence supporting the potential of S. occidentalis to control or compensate for diabetes and associated complications, with intentions to sensitize the scientific community for future research on this promising plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on the anti-diabetic pharmacological studies of Senna occidentalis was collected from various scientific databases including Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. The studies were analyzed for the toxicological, phytochemical, anti-diabetic, hypoglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemia and antioxidative aspects of the different parts of S. occidentalis. RESULTS: Numerous phytochemical constituents (flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, tannins, terpenes and glycosides) are present in this plant and are responsible for their anti-diabetic, hypoglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemic and antioxidative effects. The different plant parts appears to exert anti-diabetic effects by direct regulation of blood glucose, modulation of lipid profile and improving of antioxidant status and islet function. CONCLUSION: Senna occidentalis is rich in phytochemicals. The crude extracts of the different parts have valuable bioactive properties with potential ethnopharmacological relevance for diabetes management and treatment. Further bioassay guided phytochemical analyses of this plant are recommended to explore its therapeutic bioactive principles.",

Subsequently, other groups (n = 6/each) received CHRY for the analysis of its effect on the Light & Dark Test. The participation of the GABAergic system was also assessed using the diazepam (GABAA receptor agonist) and flumazenil (GABAA receptor antagonist). CHRY was considered non-toxic, it did not reduce the locomotor activity, and showed an anxiolytic-like effect. This effect was reduced by pre-treatment with flumazenil. The results suggest that CHRY is an anxiolytic-like agent mediated via the GABAergic system.",

Inflammation is mainly managed using conventional medicines that are associated with many side effects. Plant-based remedies are considerably better alternative therapies for they have fewer side effects. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at determining the anti-inflammatory potential of dichloromethane (DCM) leaf extracts of Eucalyptus globulus and Senna didymobotrya in mice. METHODS: Fresh leaves of these plants were harvested from Embu County, Kenya. Quantitative phytochemical analysis was done using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Anti-inflammatory test comprised nine groups of five animals each: normal, negative, positive controls and 6 experimental groups. Inflammation was induced with Carrageenan. One hour post-treatment, the different groups were intraperitoneally administered with the reference drug, diclofenac, 3% DMSO and six DCM leaf extracts at doses of 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250mg/kgbw. RESULTS: GC-MS results revealed α-phellandrene, camphene, terpinolene, and limonene among others. Anti-inflammatory effects showed that extract doses of 100,150,200 and 250mg/kg bw significantly reduced the inflamed paw. Doses of 200 and 250mg/kgbw in both plants were more potent and compared with diclofenac. E. globulus extract dose of 250mg kg bw reduced inflamed paw in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th hours, by 2.27,6.52,9.09 and 10.90% respectively while S.didymobotrya at similar dose ranges, inflamed paw reduced by 2.41, 5.43, 8.31 and 9.05% respectively. CONCLUSION: E. globulus and S. didymobotrya have potent anti-inflammatory activities, attributed to their constituent phytochemicals. This study confirms the traditional use of these plants in treating inflammation.",

Faced with therapeutic failure caused by resistance and supply disruptions, searching for other antiretroviral agents, in particular from natural sources, becomes necessary. Given popular consumption of Azadirachta indica and Senna siamea decoction in the Northern Cameroon region and the traditionally attributed antiretroviral value, information on its efficacy and safety consumption is relevant to confirm its use. A total of 297 participants aged 18-52 and HIV-positive were recruited and divided into 3 groups: one taking only the decoction (group 1), another taking only antiretroviral therapy (ARTs) (group 2), and finally, one taking the decoction and antiretroviral (group 3). During 6 months, all the participants of the concerned groups consumed daily (morning and evening) 250 mL of Azadirachta indica and Senna siamea decoction. CD4+ and CD8+ levels were measured by flow cytometry. Hepatic and renal toxicity and oxidative stress were evaluated spectrophotometrically by measuring ALT, AST, ALP, BUN, CREAT, SOD, CAT, and GSH parameters. We note an increase in the CD4+ level of the three groups with values much more pronounced in the group treated by ARTs + decoction, from 328 ± 106 to 752 ± 140. Group 2 presented not only biological signs of hepatic and renal toxicity but also significant oxidative stress. No signs of toxicity were detected in the other groups. The study concludes that a decoction of Azadirachta indica and Senna siamea stimulates the production of CD4+ and is not toxic. On the contrary, it would reduce the toxicity caused by ARTs intake."

      "abstract": "Obesity is an enduring medical issue that has raised concerns around the world. Natural plant extracts have shown therapeutic potential in preventing oxidative stress and inflammation related to obesity complications. In this study, Senna alexandrina Mill. leaves were utilized to treat high-fat diet-related metabolic disorders and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Plasma biochemical assays were conducted to determine the lipid profiles and oxidative stress parameters, and the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and inflammatory mediators was measured. Histological stained livers of high-fat diet-fed rats were observed. S. alexandrina leaf powder supplementation prevented the increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels in high-fat diet-fed rats. Moreover, S. alexandrina leaves also reduced lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide production in these rats. Prevention of oxidative stress by S. alexandrina leaf supplementation in high-fat diet-fed rats is regulated by enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activity, followed by the restoration of corresponding gene expressions, such as NRF-2, HO-1, SOD, and CAT. Histological staining provides further evidence that S. alexandrina leaf supplementation prevents inflammatory cell infiltration, lipid droplet deposition, and fibrosis in the liver of high-fat diet-fed rats. Furthermore, this investigation revealed that S. alexandrina leaf supplementation controlled non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by modulating the expression of fat metabolizing enzymes in high-fat diet-fed rats. Therefore, S. alexandrina leaf supplementation inhibits fatty liver inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting its usefulness in treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Thus, this natural leaf extract has potential in treatment of obesity related liver dysfunction.",

H.S.Irwin & Barneby seeds, has anti-inflammatory functions; it could be used as a drug component to relieve OA symptoms. In this study, we investigated the effects of obtusifolin on OA inflammation. In vitro, interleukin (IL)-1β (1 ng/mL)-treated mouse chondrocytes were co-treated with obtusifolin at different concentrations. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp) 3, Mmp13, cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2), and signaling proteins was measured by polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting; collagenase activity and the PGE2 level were also determined. In vivo, OA-induced C57BL/6 mice were administered obtusifolin, and their cartilage was stained with Safranin O to observe damage. Obtusifolin inhibited Mmp3, Mmp13, and Cox2 expression to levels similar to or more than those after treatment with celecoxib. Additionally, obtusifolin decreased collagenase activity and the PGE2 level. Furthermore, obtusifolin regulated OA via the NF-κB signaling pathway. In surgically induced OA mouse models, the cartilage destruction decreased when obtusifolin was administered orally. Taken together, our results show that obtusifolin effectively reduces cartilage damage via the regulation of MMPs and Cox2 expression. Hence, we suggest that obtusifolin could be a component of another OA symptom reliever."

The data gained from this study will be beneficial for advanced practitioners when examining for postoperative constipation concerns. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of docusate sodium and senna glycoside in the prevention and treatment of constipation following rotator cuff repair (RCR). METHODS: Patients (n = 107) were randomized to receive docusate sodium, senna glycoside, or nothing (control) in addition to a standardized postoperative protocol. Patients maintained a daily bowel-movement log for postoperative days 0-10. Constipation symptoms and quality of life were assessed preoperatively and at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively using the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) and Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) questionnaires. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of patients experienced constipation. There was no difference in the prevalence of constipation in the docusate, senna, and control groups (71.4%, 66.7%, and 64.3%, respectively; p = .88). Neither PAC-SYM nor PAC-QOL scores significantly differed between the 3 groups at any time point during 6-week follow-up (p > .05). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The majority (67%) of patients experience postoperative constipation following RCR. Although docustate sodium and senna glycoside are common first-line agents for the treatment of constipation, they are ineffective during the postoperative period. Providers need to explore other treatment modalities for postoperative constipation pain.",

To understand the molecular mechanism regarding insulin resistance. Pure compounds were isolated from wood extract. We studied their biological activities on insulin-resistance using an in vivo zebrafish model. We also performed an in silico study; molecular docking, and in vitro study by taking advantage of the enzyme inhibitory activities of α-glucosidase, PTP1B, and DPP-IV. Based on the preliminary investigation that ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts have potent effects against insulin resistance on zebrafish larvae, five compounds were isolated from two fractions following: resveratrol, piceatannol, dihydropiceatannol, chrysophanol, and emodin. All of the isolated compounds had anti-insulin resistance effects on zebrafish larvae. Resveratrol, piceatannol, and dihydropiceatannol also demonstrated inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase. Chrysophanol and emodin inhibited PTP1B activity, while resveratrol showed a DPP-IV inhibition effect via the molecular docking. The results of enzyme assay were similar. In conclusions, S. siamea components demonstrated effects against insulin resistance. The chemical structure displayed identical biological activity to that of the compounds. Therefore, S. siamea wood extract and their components are potential therapeutic options in the treatment of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Senna alata L. Roxb or candle bush is a traditional medicinal plant with a wide range of biological activities including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antifungal. Leaf extract of S. alata showed the anti-tumor activity in various cancer cell lines. In this study, we focused on the inhibitory mechanism of S. alata extract (SAE) on cancer metastasis including cell migration, cell invasion and signaling pathways in chondrosarcoma SW1353 cells. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the anti-metastatic mechanisms of Senna alata extract on chondrosarcoma SW1353 cells. METHODS: Screening for phytochemicals in biologically active fraction of SAE was analysed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Cell viability and cytoxicity were determined by using MTT assay. Cell migration was observed by scratch wound healing and transwell migration assay. Cell invasion and cell adhesion assay were examined by Matrigel coated transwell chambers or plates. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), MAPKs and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and NF-κB were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The SAE treatment at the sub-cytoxic and non-cytotoxic concentrations significantly inhibited cell migration, cell invasion and cell adhesion of SW1353 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The results from Western blot analysis showed decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, while increased TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression in SAE treated cells. Moreover, SAE suppressed phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and Akt but decreased NF-κB transcription factor expression in SW1353 cells. CONCLUSION: These results revealed that SAE could reduce MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression by downregulation of NF-κB which is downstream of MAPKs and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in SW1353 cells resulting in reduced cancer cell migration and invasion. Therefore, SAE may have the potential use as an alternative treatment of chondrosarcoma metastasis.",

METHODS: Patients were randomly administered stimulant laxative (senna, 1.0 g), osmotic agent (magnesium oxide [MgO], 1.5 g), or placebo for 28 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was overall symptom improvement. Secondary endpoints were spontaneous bowel movement (SBM), complete SBM, and patient assessment of constipation quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: Ninety patients (mean age, 42 years; 93% women; mean duration of symptoms, 9.9 years) were enrolled; all completed the study. The response rate for overall improvement was 11.7% in the placebo group, 69.2% in the senna group, and 68.3% in the MgO group (P < 0.0001). Change in SBM was significantly greater in the senna and MgO groups than that in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Similarly, change in complete SBM was significantly greater in the senna and MgO groups than that in the placebo group (P < 0.01). On the patient assessment of constipation QOL, significant improvements were seen in the senna and MgO groups compared with those in the placebo group (senna, P < 0.05; MgO, P < 0.001). The frequency of severe treatment-related adverse events was 0%. DISCUSSION: Senna and MgO significantly improved the frequency of bowel movements and QOL score and seem to be effective in the treatment of constipation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tinea imbricata, a rare form of tinea corporis caused by Trichophyton concentricum, is endemic to the T'boli tribe in the Southern Philippines. Temporary remissions and limited access to antifungal medications make its treatment a pressing public health concern. Anecdotal reports about the use of Senna alata leaf decoction as treatment exist. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of community-prepared S alata leaf decoction in the treatment of tinea imbricata. METHODS: Tinea imbricata patients were instructed to apply S alata leaf decoction for 4 weeks (28 ± 3 days). Disease severity, pruritus visual analogue scale scores (VAS) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) mounts of skin scrapings were evaluated before and after treatment. Two assessors evaluated disease severity based on photographs. Cohen's kappa statistics were used to assess diagnostic concordance. Adverse drug events were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled. After 4 weeks, 95% had decreased pruritus VAS scores, with a mean decreased of 4.05 after treatment (P < .0001). There was a significant difference in disease severity scores before and after treatment (P ≤ .05) with an overall agreement of 'moderate' for both assessors (κ = 0.6, 95% CI [0.33, 0.87]). Forty per cent had negative KOH tests after treatment. None had adverse drug events. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that showed the potential of a community-prepared leaf decoction as a treatment option for tinea imbricata. Larger clinical trials establishing its efficacy, effectiveness and safety profile are recommended to enable its promotion among the indigenous people and health authorities as an accessible and affordable treatment for tinea imbricata."

Male albino rats were used in a thirty days study comparing control, SME-treated, CdCl2-treated, and combined SME and Cd treatment. Pre-treatment with SME significantly reduced serum kidney biomarkers (urea and creatinine), the concentration of renal KIM-1, and kidney index values. Additionally, SME also attenuated CdCl2-induced oxidative and nitrosative stress in renal tissue; significantly reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations and significantly increasing antioxidant enzymes in kidney tissue. Molecularly, SME significantly upregulated antioxidant gene expression (SOD2, GR, GPx1, and CAT) caused by Cd. Notably, the augmented mRNA expression of nuclear-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by Cd was enhanced by SME administration. SME markedly suppressed the Cd-induced rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The combination of Cd and SME relieved the Cd-induced apoptotic damage by enhancing Bcl2 and suppressing Bax and Cas-3 levels in renal tissue. The renal tissue histoarchitecture confirmed the biochemical and molecular findings. Collectively, our data indicate that SME can counteract Cd-induced renal intoxication through anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Like mammalian cells, helminth parasites are equipped with an array of enzymatic anti-oxidant system which has an adaptive strategy to cope up with several conditions of stress that arise from host immune response or drug treatment. Earlier, we had reported that three species of Senna, viz. S. alata, S. alexandrina and S. occidentalis leaf extracts caused severe morphological and biochemical alterations in the zoonotic parasite Hymenolepis diminuta. To understand whether the leaf extracts of the three species of Senna have any effect on the enzymatic anti-oxidant system in H.diminuta or not, the present study was investigated on the mechanism of action of these leaf extracts on the anti-oxidant system of the parasite. The viability of the parasite was assessed by MTT reduction assay, chromatin condensation through Hoechst staining of tissue and DNA fragmentation assay, and the oxidative enzymes of the parasite were estimated biochemically. Activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S- transferase and glutathione peroxidase were found to be increased in all the treated parasites from that of the control, with S. alata showed the highest increased amongst the three plant species in all the enzymes, at 331.0 %, 215.4 %, 85.4 % and 65.5 % respectively. Upliftment of apoptotic protein CED-3, CED-4 and EGL-1 and down regulation of anti-apototic protein CED-9 was visualised in all treated paraites. The redox imbalance triggered by these leaf extracts resulted in the activation of apoptotic pathway that led to death of the parasite. Our results demonstrated that the leaf extracts of the three Senna plant species could open new insight for an affordable natural anthelmintic with high efficacy and less toxicity.",

      "abstract": "ETHNO-PHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The age-long folkloric use of Senna alata flower (SAF) was recently substantiated with scientific evidence. However, the study did not account for the anti-diabetic principle(s) in SAF. AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aimed to identify and characterize the bioactive principle(s) responsible for the anti-diabetic activity in SAF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-one male Wistar rats were used for the two phases of this study. In phase 1, forty-two of these were allotted into six groups (A-F) of seven rats each. Animals in group A received distilled water while those in groups B-F were made diabetic by treatment with 150 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) of alloxan. Group B received 0.5 mL of distilled water; C, D and E were treated each with 75 mg/kg b.w. of ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous residual fractions of SAF, while F received 2.5 mg/kg b.w. of glibenclamide. In the second phase, forty-nine rats were assigned into seven groups (A-G) of seven rats each. Group A received distilled water. Animals in Groups B-G were also made diabetic by alloxan treatment. B received 0.5 mL of distilled water; C, D, E and F were treated with 5.77, 25.96, 15.40, 27.87 mg/kg b.w (equivalent dose of 75 mg/kg b.w.) of sub-fractions obtained from the ethyl acetate fraction of SAF respectively whereas G received 2.5 mg/kg b.w. of glibenclamide. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum lipids, albumin, globulin, liver glycogen, urine ketone, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities, α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities and cardiac function indices were evaluated using standard methods. Compounds D, E and F isolated from ethyl acetate sub-fraction B were evaluated for in vitro anti-diabetic activity. The structure of the anti-diabetic compound was identified using FTIR, 1H-NMR, 1³C-NMR, HCOSY, HSQC and HMBC. Data were subjected to Analysis of Variance and Duncan Multiple Range Test at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Alloxan treatment increased the levels of FBG, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, urine ketone and cardiac function indices and reduced the levels of globulin, albumin, HDL-cholesterol, globulin, liver glycogen, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities. Ethyl acetate fraction and sub-fraction B reversed the level and/or activities of these biochemical indices to levels and/or activities that compared favourably with the distilled water treated non-diabetic animals. Of the three compounds (D, E and F) that were obtained from the sub-fraction B, compound E which was Emodin (1, 3, 8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) produced the highest α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities. CONCLUSION: Emodin is one of the bioactive constituents present in Senna alata flower.",

      "abstract": "The Malus pumila leaves are used as a kind of tea drink in China, and there are abundant flavonoids in the leaves of Malus pumila. In this study, BALB/c mice received senna extract solution via gavage, which induced acute diarrhea, and the interventive effect of Malus pumila leaf flavonoids (MPLF) was observed. The results showed that MPLF decreased the diarrhea index, and MPLF also decreased the capillary permeability in the abdominal cavity of mice. The result of serum cytokine detection indicated that MPLF decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) indicated that diarrhea decreased the mRNA and protein expression of aquaporin-3 (AQP3) in the jejunum and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in the ileum, which were inhibited by MPLF. By high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), MPLF mainly contains 10 flavonoids, which are rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, taxifolin, quercitrin, hesperidin, myricetin, baicalin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone and quercetin, the synergistic effect of these components plays an antidiarrhea role in MPLF. Therefore, MPLF achieved good antidiarrheal effect, which was better than that of the commonly used montmorillonite powder at the same concentration. MPLF is a natural raw material for functional food with an antidiarrheal effect."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Environmental contamination by lead (Pb) and other toxic metals is of significant environmental and human health concern. Heavy metals are not readily eliminated by degradation, and thus remediation of contaminated media (soil, sediment and water/sludge) requires the outright removal or cleanup of these metals. Evaluation of the performance and cost efficiency of various remediation methods has led to the development of bioremediation as an inexpensive, innovative and environmentally friendly cleanup strategy. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to assess the Pb remediation potential of wild Senna obtusifolia (Sicklepod), in Dareta Village, Zamfara, Nigeria. METHODS: Soil and Senna obtusifolia samples were collected from established plots and Pb content was determined using a Shimadzu atomic absorption spectrophotometer (model AA-6800, Japan) after wet digestion. RESULTS: The mean concentrations of Pb (mg/kg) in soil, roots, stems and leaves, respectively, were 130.68±5.2, 61.33±17.86, 66.64±18.10 and 173.39±13.73 for plot 1, 287.84±6.5, 69.42±11.62, 123.4±3.67 and 294.28±4.38 for plot 2, 315.73±4.13, 68.42±10.22, 86.89±6.08 and 290.61±7.47 for plot 3, 396.86±5.48, 91.64±2.87, 150.58±2.21 and 282.53±5.69 for plot 4 and 264.23±8.02, 72.71±2.18, 124.60±2.27 and 282.40±3.79 for plot 5. Average values for the translocation factor, bioaccumulation factor and bioconcentration factor were 3.65±0.66, 1.01±0.23 and 0.29±0.10, respectively. DISCUSSION: Soil Pb levels in the present study were found to be within the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standards and the Dutch Intervention Values for Pb in soil. Lead content of Senna obtusifolia leaves was found to be higher than the Pb content of the stem and root, indicating relatively low restriction and the efficiency of internal transport of the toxic metal from the roots towards the aerial parts. High translocation and bioaccumulation factors indicate that the plant has vital characteristics for phytoextraction of Pb. The mean Pb concentration of Senna obtusifolia leaves was found to be far above Codex general standards and the European Union (EU) maximum levels for Pb in leafy vegetables. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that wild Senna obtusifolia has significant characteristics for phytoextraction of Pb and that consumption of Senna obtusifolia leaves from the study area would pose a serious risk of Pb intoxication. COMPETING INTERESTS: The authors declare no competing financial interests."

The plant is traditionally used in the treatment of typhoid, diabetes, malaria, asthma, ringworms, tinea infections, scabies, blotch, herpes, and eczema. The review is aimed at unveiling the ethnobotanical description and pharmacological activities of S. alata. Different parts of the plant are reported in folk medicine as therapeutic substances for remediation of diverse diseases and infections. The extracts and isolated compounds displayed pronounced pharmacological activities. Display of antibacterial, antioxidant, antifungal, dermatophytic, anticancer, hepatoprotective, antilipogenic, anticonvulsant, antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, antimalarial, anthelmintic, and antiviral activities could be due to the array of secondary metabolites such as tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenes, anthraquinone, saponins, phenolics, cannabinoid alkaloids, 1,8-cineole, caryophyllene, limonene, α-selinene, β-caryophyllene, germacrene D, cinnamic acid, pyrazol-5-ol, methaqualone, isoquinoline, quinones, reducing sugars, steroids, and volatile oils present in different parts of the plant. The review divulges the ethnobotanical and pharmacological activities of the plant and also justifies the ethnomedical claims. The significant medicinal value of this plant necessitates a scientific adventure into the bioactive metabolites which constitute various extracts."

      "abstract": "Senna alexandrina is traditionally used for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but little information is available concerning its potential protective effects against cadmium, which is a widespread environmental toxicant that causes hepatotoxicity. Here, we explored the effects of S. alexandrina extract (SAE) on cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-induced liver toxicity over 4 weeks in rats. Rats were allocated into four groups: control, SAE (100 mg/kg), CdCl2 (0.6 mg/kg), and SAE + CdCl2, respectively. Cadmium level in hepatic tissue, blood transaminases, and total bilirubin as indicators of liver function were assessed. Oxidative stress indices [malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrate/nitrite (NO), and glutathione (GSH)], antioxidant molecules [superoxide dismutase (SOD, catalase (CAT), glutathione-derived enzymes, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)], pro-inflammatory mediators [interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)], apoptosis proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3), and histological alterations to the liver were examined. SAE administration before CdCl2 exposure decreased cadmium deposition in liver tissue and the blood liver function indicators. SAE pre-treatment prevented oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic reactions and decreased histological alterations to the liver caused by CdCl2 exposure. SAE can be used as a promising protective agent against CdCl2-induced hepatotoxicity by increasing Nrf2 expression. Graphical abstract.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fever is managed using synthetic drugs such as aspirin, paracetamol among others. Synthetic drugs are associated with many side effects. Herbal medicines form alternative therapy since they possess fewer side effects and are readily available. This study aimed to determine antipyretic potential of DCM extracts of E. globulus and S. didymobotrya in Swiss albino rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant leaves samples were obtained from Embu County, Kenya. Dichloromethane solvent was used to extract bioactive constituents from the plant samples. Three grams of DCM leaf extracts of Eucalyptus globulus (Labill) and Senna didymobotrya (Fresenius) samples were obtained and analyzed to determine quantitative phytochemical composition at ICIPE laboratory using GC-MS. Albino rats were used in the antipyretic activity study. Nine groups of five experimental animals were used in each test: Positive control, normal control, negative control and experimental (25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mg/kg body weight extracts) groups. Pyrexia was induced by injection of turpentine in albino rats intraperitoneally. One hour later, the pyretic animals received the leaf extracts at various dose levels, reference drug (aspirin100 mg/kg body) or the vehicle (DMSO). RESULTS: Results of antipyretic in vivo bioscreening revealed that E. globulus and S. didymobotrya possess potent antipyretic activity which was comparable to that of the reference drug aspirin. Both extracts exhibited highest antipyretic activity at a dose of 250 mg/kg bw. Results of the GC-MS revealed that these plants possess bio-compounds such as Terpinolene, Alpha-pinene, Borneol, Globulol and Terpineols that are associated with antipyretic activity. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study revealed that these plants are endowed with bioactive compounds such as terpenoids, and flavonoids that possess antipyretic activity in rats."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive actions of an ethanol extract of Senna septemtrionalis aerial parts (SSE). The in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of SSE were assessed using LPS-stimulated macrophages and the subsequent quantification of the levels of cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) with ELISA kits, nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The in vivo anti-inflammatory actions of SSE were evaluated with the TPA-induced ear oedema test and the carrageenan-induced paw oedema test. The antinociceptive actions of SSE (10-200 mg/kg p.o.) were assessed using three models: two chemical assays (formalin-induced orofacial pain and acetic acid-induced visceral pain) and one thermal assay (hot plate). SSE showed in vitro anti-inflammatory actions with IC50 values calculated as follows: 163.3 µg/ml (IL-6), 154.7 µg/ml (H2O2) and > 200 µg/ml (IL-1β, TNF-α, and NO). SSE showed also in vivo anti-inflammatory actions in the TPA test (40% of inhibition of ear oedema) and the carrageenan test (ED50 = 137.8 mg/kg p.o.). SSE induced antinociceptive activity in the formalin orofacial pain test (ED50 = 80.1 mg/kg) and the acetic acid-induced writhing test (ED50 = 110 mg/kg). SSE showed no antinociceptive actions in the hot plate assay. The pre-treatment with glibenclamide abolished the antinociceptive action shown by SSE alone. Overall, SSE exerted in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory actions, and in vivo antinociceptive effects by the possible involvement of ATP-sensitive K + channels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Paramphistomosis is a pathogenic disease of domesticated ruminants, causing great economic loss in dairy industry and meat production. It is considered as a neglected tropical disease with highest prevalence throughout tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. There are few trematocidal drugs available in the market. Most are resistant and have elevated side effects. Therefore, alternative trematocidal drugs need to discover. This study was conducted to evaluate three plants leaf extracts (from Senna alata, S. alexandrina, and S. occidentalis) as effective remedies against gastrointestinal trematode parasite (Paramphistomum gracile) of ruminants. Live adult parasites were collected in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) from fresh autopsied goat's rumen. Parasites were incubated in leaf extracts of S. alata, S. alexandrina and, S. occidentalis individually and in combination (1:1) ratio at 37 ± 1°C. Treatment media contain extracts at different concentrations (10, 20 and 40 mg/mL) in 10 mL of 0.1 M PBS with 1% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). Parasites in control group were incubated in PBS without extract. The efficacy of three Senna extracts was evaluated on the basis of dose-dependent motility and mortality of the trematode. Immediately after paralysis, all treated parasites were collected for histology, SEM and biochemical study. RESULTS: Dose-dependent efficacy was observed in terms of motility and time of mortality in all treated parasites after exposure in various concentrations of the Senna plant extracts. S. occidentalis and S. alexandrina showed better efficacy in combination than comparing with individual treatment groups. Histological study and scanning electron microscopic observations revealed conspicuous deformity of surface architecture in all treated parasites. Scanning electron micrographs also revealed shrinkage, vacuolization, infoldings and blebbings on the body surface of treated worms. Activities of tegumental enzymes were inhibited in all treatment groups compared to control. CONCLUSION: The overall findings from this study revealed that all three Senna leaf extracts individually and in combination showed potential antitrematocidal activity against Paramphistomum gracile by damaging body tegument and neural propagation. Thus, this study confirmed that all three Senna extracts can be considered as a potential drug-like candidate in indigenous system of traditional medicine against trematode infections in livestock.",

      "abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma is among the most aggressive types of cancer, and its rate of occurrence increases every year. Current pharmacological treatments for melanoma are not completely effective, requiring the identification of new drugs. As an alternative, plant-derived natural compounds are described as promising sources of new anticancer drugs. In this context, the objectives of this study were to identify the chemical composition of the ethanolic extract of Senna velutina roots (ESVR), to assess its in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects on melanoma cells, and to characterize its mechanisms of action. For these purposes, the chemical constituents were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. The in vitro activity of the extract was assessed in the B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cell line using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and based on the apoptotic cell count; DNA fragmentation; necrostatin-1 inhibition; intracellular calcium, pan-caspase, and caspase-3 activation; reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels; and cell cycle arrest. The in vivo activity of the extract was assessed in models of tumor volume progression and pulmonary nodule formation in C57Bl/6 mice. The chemical composition results showed that ESVR contains flavonoid derivatives of the catechin, anthraquinone, and piceatannol groups. The extract reduced B16F10-Nex2 cell viability and promoted apoptotic cell death as well as caspase-3 activation, with increased intracellular calcium and ROS levels as well as cell cycle arrest at the sub-G0/G1 phase. In vivo, the tumor volume progression and pulmonary metastasis of ESVR-treated mice decreased over 50%. Combined, these results show that ESVR had in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects, predominantly by apoptosis, thus demonstrating its potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of melanoma and other types of cancer.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Ethnopharmacological relevance Senna septemtrionalis (Viv.) H.S. Irwin & Barneby (Fabaceae) is a shrub empirically used as diuretic, and for the treatment of neurological disorders. These pharmacological effects have not been previously evaluated. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the diuretic and CNS effects of a standardized ethanol extract of Senna septemtrionalis aerial parts (SSE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gas chromatography mass spectrometry was used to perform a chemical analysis with SSE. In all tests, SSE was evaluated from 10 to 100 mg/kg p.o. The diuretic activity of SSE was assessed in mice individually placed in metabolic cages. After 6 h, the urine volume and the electrolyte excretion (Na and K) were measured. The role of prostaglandins and nitric oxide was assessed administrating mice with indomethacin and N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), prior the administration of 100 mg/kg SSE. The sedative effects of SSE were analyzed with the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time test. The effects of SSE on motor coordination in mice were evaluated with the rotarod test. The antidepressant-like activity of SSE was analyzed with the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST). The role of 5-HT2 receptor, α1-and α2-adrenoceptors, or muscarinic receptors was assessed administrating mice with cyproheptadine, prazosin, yohimbine, and atropine, respectively, prior the administration of 100 mg/kg SSE in the FST. The anxiolytic-like activity of SSE (10-100 mg/kg p.o.) was assessed using the light-dark test (LDB), the elevated plus maze test (EPM), the cylinder exploratory test, and the open field test (OFT). The anticonvulsant effect of SSE (1-100 mg/kg) was evaluated in mice administered with different convulsant agents: strychnine, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), isoniazid (INH) or yohimbine. RESULTS: The main compound found in SSE was D-pinitol (42.2%). SSE (100 mg/kg) increased the urinary volume (2.67-fold), as well as the excretion of Na (5.60-fold) and K (7.2-fold). The co-administration of SSE with L-NAME or indomethacin reverted the diuretic activity shown by SSE alone. SSE lacked sedative effects and did not affect motor coordination in mice. SSE (100 mg/kg) showed higher and similar antidepressant-like effect, compared to 20 mg/kg fluoxetine, in the FST and TST, respectively. The co-administration of SSE with yohimbine reverted the antidepressant-like activity shown by SSE alone. SSE (100 mg/kg) showed anxiolytic-like activity in the four models of anxiety, with similar activity with 1.5 mg/kg clonazepam. The seizure-protective effect of SSE was ED50 = 73.9 ± 8.4 mg/kg (INH) and 40.4 ± 5.2 mg/kg (yohimbine). CONCLUSION: The diuretic effects of SSE involve the possible contribution of prostaglandins and nitric oxide. SSE showed moderate anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects, whereas the participation of α2-adrenoceptors is probably associated in the antidepressant-like effects of SSE.",

The present study is based on the light and confocal microscopic studies to understand if Senna extracts affect neurotransmitter activity of the parasites. A standard concentration (40 mg/mL) of the three leaf extracts and one set of 0.005 mg/mL concentration of the reference drug praziquantel were tested against the parasites, keeping another set of parasites in phosphate buffer saline as a control. Histochemical studies were carried out using acetylthiocholine iodide as the substrate and acetylcholinesterase as the marker enzyme for studying the expression of the neurotransmitter of the parasite and the staining intensity was observed under a light microscope. Immunohistochemical studies were carried out using anti serotonin primary antibody and fluorescence tagged secondary antibody and observed using confocal microscopy. Intensity of the stain decreases in treated parasites compared with the control which implies loss of activity of the neurotransmitters. These observations indicated that Senna have a strong anthelmintic effect on the parasite model and thus pose as a potential anthelmintic therapy.",

Their potential side effects have attracted more attention in clinics but have little scientific justification. In this study, senna extract (SE), sennosides (SS), and sennoside A (SA) were prepared and used to generate diarrhea rats. The diarrhea rats were investigated with behaviors, clinical signs, organ index, pathological examination, and gene expression on multiple aquaporins (Aqps) including Aqp1, Aqp2, Aqp3, Aqp4, Aqp5, Aqp6, Aqp7, Aqp8, Aqp9, and Aqp11. Using qRT-PCR, the Aqp expression profiles were constructed for six organs including colon, kidney, liver, spleen, lung, and stomach. The Aqp alteration profiles were characterized and was performed with Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The SE treatments on the rats resulted in a significant body weight loss (p < 0.001), significant increases (p < 0.001) on the kidney index (27.72%) and liver index (42.55%), and distinguished changes with up-regulation on Aqps expressions in the kidneys and livers. The SS treatments showed prominent laxative actions and down regulation on Aqps expression in the colons. The study results indicated that the SE had more influence/toxicity on the kidneys and livers. The SS showed more powerful actions on the colons. We suggest that the caution should be particularly exercised in the patients with kidney and liver diseases when chronic using senna-based products.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Senna is a stimulant laxative commonly used by pediatricians, pediatric gastroenterologists, and pediatric surgeons. Many clinicians avoid Senna for reasons such as tolerance or side effects but this has little scientific justification. We recently found several patients we were caring for developed perineal blistering during the course of Senna treatment. Because of this we chose to review the literature to identify side effects in children taking this medication as well as to analyze our Center's experience with Senna's secondary effects. METHODS: We performed a literature review (MEDLINE, PUBMED) using the keywords of Senna, sen, sennosides and children, and pediatric and functional (idiopathic) constipation. We looked for articles with information regarding perineal blisters related to Senna as well as other secondary effects of Senna laxatives in children when used on a long-term basis. We also reviewed the charts of our patients who had previously taken Senna or are currently taking Senna, looking for adverse reactions. RESULTS: Eight articles in the literature reported perineal blisters after administration of Senna laxatives in 28 patients. Of those occurrences, 18 patients (64%) had accidental administration of Senna and 10 (36%) had Senna prescribed as a long term treatment. All of the blistering episodes were related to high dose, night-time accidents, or intense diarrhea with a long period of stool to skin contact. At our institution, from 2014 to 2017, we prescribed Senna and have recorded data to 640 patients. During the study period, 17 patients (2.2%) developed blisters during their treatment. Patients who developed blisters had higher doses 60mg/day; 60 [12-100] vs. 17.5 [1.7-150] (p<0.001). All of the blistering episodes were related to night-time accidents, with a long period of stool to skin contact. 83 (13%) patients presented minor side effects such as abdominal cramping, vomiting or diarrhea which resolved once the type of laxatives were changed or enemas were started. The doses of Senna was not significantly different in these patients 15mg/day [4.4-150] vs. 17.5mg/day [1.5-150]. There were no other long-term side effects from Senna found in the pediatric literature for long-term treatment besides abdominal cramping or diarrhea during the first weeks of administration. We found no evidence of tolerance to Senna in our review. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of information in the literature regarding side effects of sennosides as a long-term therapy, and to our knowledge, this is the first review of Senna side effects in children. Senna induced dermatitis is rare, but may occur when patients need a higher dose. All of the cases described had a long period of exposure of the skin to stool. Besides the perineal rash with blisters, we could find no other described major side effect with Senna administration in the pediatric population or evidence of the frequently mentioned concern of the development of tolerance to Senna. Pediatric caregivers should advise families of the rare side effect of skin blistering and educate them to change the diaper frequently in children who are not toilet- trained to reduce stool to skin exposure. We can conclude from this review that Senna is a safe treatment option for constipation in children. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Senna singueana (Del.) Lock (Fabaceae) is a shrub or tree found in Ethiopia and other African countries. It has been traditionally used for different conditions including treatment of pain conditions in humans and animals. Although various reports are available in the literature claiming different activities of the plant, scientific studies supporting analgesic potential of S. singueana are lacking and the present study aimed to investigate the antinociceptive effect of methanol extract of leaves of S. singueana in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-nociceptive activity of S. singueana (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg, p.o) was investigated using acetic acid-induced writhing, formalin-induced paw licking, and hot plate tests. Acute oral toxicity was determined using a slightly modified guideline (423) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. RESULTS: S. singueana extract increased the percentage of inhibition of writhing response and licking response (neurogenic and inflammatory phase) in acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced paw licking tests, respectively. It also significantly (p ≤ 0.05) increased the percentage of mean maximal effect (%MPE) compared to control group in the hot-plate test. In all models, the combination of S. singueana with either diclofenac or morphine produced statistically significant increase (p ≤ 0.05) in the percentage of inhibition of writhing, paw licking, and %MPE compared to single treatment groups. It was also found that the 400 mg/kg extract produced higher antinociceptive effects (p ≤ 0.05) compared to the 200 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: S. singueana leaves may have analgesic effect that is mediated through both peripheral and central mechanisms and could be used as adjuvant treatment to the modern analgesics.",

The management of such oxidative stress is the biggest challenge over the decade. The main objective was to analyze the protective effect of ethanolic extract of Senna alata L leaves on enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems of hepatic and renal tissues in Streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. METHODS: The use of streptozotocin diabetes was induced in the experimental rats and the subsequent therapeutic effects of standard drug glibenclamide and Senna alata L were compared. The levels of plasma insulin, glucose, urea, uric acid, creatinine, vitamin C, vitamin E, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-s-tranferase were assayed in control and experimental groups of rats. RESULTS: These alterations were detected throughout the study duration after the treatment with Senna alata L and glibenclamide. A significant raise followed by the treatment with Senna alata leaves in vitamin E, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-s-tranferase was observed. It has been found that notable decline in the levels of vitamin C, reduced glutathione were observed in diabetic rats. The liver and kidney based antioxidant enzyme activities were significantly responsive to the treatment in diabetic rats. Apart from these antioxidant system, some vital changes were detected in the typical biochemical parameters such as level of protein, urea, uric acid, and creatinine from abnormal into normal in both the control and induced rats. CONCLUSION: From the above said observations, it was very clear that, Senna alata has helped to manage the oxidative tension in diabetic rats, which in turn may greatly support the hypoglycaemic potency of Senna alata L."

      "abstract": "Senna occidentalis is a toxic leguminous plant found in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world and causes poisoning mainly in confined animals. The seeds are the most toxic part of the plant and may be present in animal rations. The main toxic component of the S. occidentalis seed is a dianthrone, an anthraquinone-derived compound that affects mitochondrial function. This study evaluated the effects on egg production of low-level contamination of the S. occidentalis in the laying hens' diet. Forty-eight one-day-old pullets were randomly allocated into two treatment groups: control, birds that received no experimental treatment; and external and internal tegument (ET/IT), birds that received a diet containing 0.2% of ET/IT of S. occidentalis seeds throughout their life cycle (42 weeks). The birds were monitored for clinical signs of poisoning, and the production and quality of eggs were recorded. Necropsies were conducted at the end of the experimental period. None of the layers showed any clinical signs of poisoning, decreases in feed intake or alterations of the body weight gain. A marked reduction in egg production and, consequently, a lower feed efficiency in ET/IT group were measured. Ovaries were the most affected organ in birds from the ET/IT group, and yolk leaking and dysplasia of the inner layer of the vitelline membrane were observed. S. occidentalis was shown to be toxic for laying hens. Considering these results, it is feasible to assume that the constant presence of low concentrations of S. occidentalis seeds in rations represents a threat to the poultry industry.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Constipation is present in 80% of children with corrected anorectal malformations, usually associated to rectal dilation and hypomotility. Osmotic laxatives are routinely used for idiopathic constipation. Senna is a stimulant laxative that produces contractions improving colonic motility without affecting the stool consistency. We designed this trial to study the effectiveness of Senna versus polyethylene glycol for the treatment of constipation in children with anorectal malformation. METHODS: A randomized controlled crossover design clinical trial, including a washout period, was conducted, including children with corrected anorectal malformations with fecal continence and constipation. The sample size was calculated for proportions (n=28) according to available data for Senna. Effectiveness of laxative therapy was measured with a three variable construct: 1) daily bowel movement, 2) fecal soiling, 3) a \"clean\" abdominal x-ray. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and a Fisher's exact test for the outcome variable (effectiveness). RESULTS: The study was terminated early because the interim analysis showed a clear benefit toward Senna (p = 0.026). The sample showed a normal statistical distribution for the variables age and presence of megarectum. The maximum daily dose of Senna (sennosides A and B) was 38.7mg and 17g for polyethylene glycol. No adverse effects were identified. CONCLUSION: Therapy with Senna should be the laxative treatment of choice as part of a bowel management program in children with repaired anorectal malformations and constipation, since the stimulation of colonic propulsion waves could lead to stool evacuation without modification of its consistency which can affect fecal continence.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: S. racemosa was collected in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico (21°58'N, 89°36'W) in June 2005. The bark methanol extract was obtained and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) was used to generate a constituent profile. In vivo anti-giardia activity was assayed with an experimental model of G. intestinalis infection in neonatal CD-1 mice. Nine doses ranging from 0.25-15mg extract/kg body weight were tested to determine the dose required to kill 50% of the trophozoites (ED50). An acute toxicity assay was run in which one of four single doses (200, 1000, 2000 and3000mg/kg body weight) was orally administered to adult Wistar rats. Animal weight, death rates, toxic effects and behavioral parameters were observed over a 14-d period. They were then euthanized and a necropsy performed. RESULTS: The S. racemosa bark extract inhibited growth of G. intestinalis (ED50=1.14mg/Kg) in neonatal CD-1 mice. No toxic or lethal effects were observed even at the highest dosage (3000mg/Kg), and neither were signs of toxicity observed in internal organs. The active compounds chrysophanol and physcion were present in the extract at a 1.76 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The results strongly support traditional use of S. racemosa bark for treatment of diarrhea caused by Giardia intestinalis infection.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of malarial resistance to most antimalarial drugs is the main factor driving the continued effort to identify/discover new agents for combating the disease. Moreover, the unacceptably high mortality rate in severe malaria has led to the consideration of adjuvant therapies. Senna singueana leaves are traditionally used against malaria and fever. Extracts from the leaves of this plant demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities, which in turn could reduce the severity of malaria. Extracts from the root bark of this plant exhibited antiplasmodial activity; however, the leaves are the more sustainable resource. Thus, S. singueana leaf was selected for in vivo evaluation as a potential alternative or adjuvant therapy for malaria. Using malaria [Plasmodium berghei ANKA, chloroquine (CQ) sensitive]-infected Swiss albino mice of both sexes, 70% ethanol extract of S. singueana leaves (alone and in combination with CQ) was tested for antimalarial activity and adjuvancy potential. The 4-day suppressive test was used to evaluate antimalarial activity. The dose of S. singueana extract administered was safe to mice and exhibited some parasite suppression effect: extract doses of 200 mg/kg/d, 400 mg/kg/d, and 800 mg/kg/d caused 34.54%, 44.52%, and 47.32% parasite suppression, respectively. Concurrent administration of the extract with CQ phosphate at varied dose levels indicated that the percentage of parasite suppression of this combination was higher than administering CQ alone, but less than the sum of the effects of the extract and CQ acting separately. In conclusion, the study indicated that 70% ethanol extract of S. singueana leaf was safe to mice and possessed some parasite suppression effect. Coadministration of the extract with CQ appeared to boost the overall antimalarial effect, indicating that the combination may have a net health benefit if used as an adjuvant therapy."

      "abstract": "Cancer is one of the most critical problems of public health in the world and one of the main challenges for medicine in this century. Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed at advanced stage, when the treatment options are palliative. Consequently, the search for novel therapeutic options is imperative. In the context, the plants represent an important source for discovering of novel compounds with pharmacological potential including antineoplastic agents. Herein, we aimed to investigate in vitro antiproliferative and cytotoxic potentials of an alkaloid mixture derived from Senna spectabilis, (−)-cassine (1) and (−)-spectaline (2). These alkaloids reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner of six tumor cell lines. From initial screening, HepG2 cells were selected for further investigations. We show that alkaloids 1/2 have an important antiproliferative activity on HepG2 cells due to their ability in inducing cell cycle arrest in G1/S transition. This effect was associated to ERK inactivation and down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression. In addition, we evidenced a disruption of the microfilaments and microtubules in a consequence of the treatment. Taken together, the data showed by the first time that alkaloids 1/2 strongly inhibit cell proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Therefore, they represent promise antitumor compounds against liver cancer and should be considered for further anticancer in vivo studies.",

      "abstract": "Senna occidentalis (S. occidentalis) is a toxic leguminous plant that contaminates crops and has been shown to be toxic to several animal species. All parts of the plant are toxic, but most of the plant's toxicity is due to its seeds. Despite its toxicity, S. occidentalis is widely used for therapeutic purposes in humans. The aim of the present work was to investigate, for the first time, the effects of the chronic administration of S. occidentalis seeds on hematopoietic organs, including the bone marrow and spleen. Fifty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups of 10 animals. Rats were treated with diets containing 0% (control), 0.5% (So0.5), 1% (So1), or 2% (So2) S. occidentalis seeds for a period of 90 days. Food and water were provided ad libitum, except to pair-fed (PF) group which received the same amount of ration to those of So2 group, however free of S. occidentalis seeds. It was verified that rats treated with 2% S. occidentalis seeds presented changes in hematological parameters. The blood evaluation also showed a significant decrease of the Myeloid/Erythroid (M/E) ratio. Chronic treatment with S. occidentalis promoted a reduction in the cellularity of both the bone marrow and spleen. Additionally, we observed changes in bone marrow smears, iron stores and spleen hemosiderin accumulation. Histological analyses of bone marrow revealed erythroid hyperplasia which was consistent with the increased reticulocyte count. These findings suggest that the long-term administration of S. occidentalis seeds can promote blood toxicity.",

In our study, the dose and duration of senna-based laxatives (SBL) treatment to achieve full defecatory control will be examined for possible correlation with new parameters measured from the initial contrast enema. METHODS: Initially, an observational study was conducted prospectively on a group of patient with ORSI to define the optimum dose of SBL to achieve full defecatory control with measurement of six parameters in the initial contrast enema (level of colonic dilatation, recto-anal angle, ratio of maximal diameter of dilated colon to last lumbar spine, ratio of maximum diameter of dilated colon to normal descending colon, immediate and after 24-h post-evacuation residual contrast). The result was analyzed statistically to reach a correlation between the radiological data and prescribed dose. RESULTS: Over 2 and half years, 72 patients were included in the study; their mean age was 6.3 ± 3.33 years. The mean effective starting dose of SBL was 57 ± 18.13 mg/day and the mean effective ending dose was 75 ± 31.68 mg/day. Time lapsed till full defecatory control ranged from 1 to 16 weeks. Statistical correlation revealed that mean effective ending dose of SBL treatment significantly increased with higher levels of colonic dilatation. A weak positive correlation was found for both the mean effective starting and ending doses with the ratio of maximum colonic diameter to last lumbar spine and descending colonic diameters ratio. CONCLUSION: Senna-based laxatives are effective treatment for overflow retentive stool incontinence and their doses can be adjusted initially depending on the analysis of the radiological data.",

METHODS: In this double blind, randomized, active comparator trial, adults who required opioids for analgesia following orthopedic procedures and who were admitted in inpatient rehabilitation were randomized following baseline assessments to lubiprostone (Amitza(®)), orally twice a day or Senna (generic) two capsules administered daily for six days. Subjects were assessed using the patient assessment of constipation (PAC)-symptoms (PAC-SYM) and the PAC-quality of life (PAC-QOL) scales measured at baseline and Day 7; Subjects were assessed daily for secondary measures included the Bristol stool scale bowel consistency, specific bowel symptom score (Nausea, cramping, straining, completeness, abdominal pain, time per lavatory attempt, assistance needed), adverse events and rescue medications required. Function was measured using the functional independence measure (FIM) at admission and discharge; length of stay (LOS) and missed treatments due to gastrointestinal symptoms were also assessed. RESULTS: 64 adults were enrolled; 56 participants (28 in each group) had baseline and follow up measures and were included in the intention to treat (ITT) analyses. 43 participants completed the study, 21 in the active lubiprostone and 22 in the active Senna group. The mean age of the participants was 71.5 years (SD = 11.4 years, range: 28-96 years). In the ITT analyses, participants showed significant improvement in bowel symptoms as measured by the PAC-SYM (mean ± SD, -0.28 ± 0.60, range: -1-2.33) and PAC-QOL (mean ± SD, 0.33 ± 0.81, range: -1.5-2.0) over time, but there were no significant differences between the lubiprostone and Senna groups in mean change in the PAC-SYM (-0.20 ± 0.60 vs -0.36 ± 0.61, P = 0.61 respectively) or the PAC-QOL (0.29 ± 0.76 vs 0.37 ± 0.87, P = 0.61 respectively). The mean change in each bowel symptom also did not significantly differ between treatment groups on ITT analyses, except for completeness of bowel movement, with the Senna group showing greater negative mean change in bowel movement completeness (-0.56 ± 1.01 vs -2.00 ± 1.41, P = 0.03) and for reduction of abdominal pain, favoring Senna (-0.14 ± 0.73 vs -0.73 ± 1.08, P = 0.04). Fifteen (75%) participants in the lubiprostone and in the Senna group requested rescue treatments. Participants made significant functional improvement from admission to discharge over a median LOS of 12 d, with a mean FIM change of 29.13 ± 13.58 and no significant between group differences (27.0 ± 9.2 vs 31.5 ± 16.6, P = 0.27). CONCLUSION: Both lubiprostone and Senna improved constipation-related symptoms and QOL in opioid-induced constipation, with no significant between-group differences.",

Gum chewing has been reported to have a favorable effect on postoperative bowel functions. We conducted this study to establish if gum chewing added to high-dose senna before colonoscopy promotes bowel cleaning. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, consecutive outpatients scheduled for elective colonoscopy were randomized into two groups. Group 1 patients (n = 65) used senna solution 150 mL (300 mg senna) the night before colonoscopy. The patients also used sennoside tablet 80 mg daily for 3 days before the colonoscopy. Patients in group 2 (n = 64) were additionally advised to chew sugarless gum half an hour three-times daily after meals for these 3 days. The overall quality of colonoscopy cleaning was evaluated using the Aronchick scale by a single endoscopist who was blinded to the intervention. Difficulty of procedure, patients' tolerance, and adverse events were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total 129 patients were enrolled in the study. Superior cleaning was found in gum chewing group when compared with other group particularly in the cecum and ascending colon. Cecal intubation time was significantly shorter in the gum-chewing group (8.6 ± 5.1 and 7.1 ± 2.8 min, P = 0.03). Adverse events were more common in group 1 compared to the gum-chewing group. CONCLUSIONS: Gum chewing enhances colonoscopy bowel preparation quality. Moreover, it is a physiologically sound, safe, and an inexpensive part of the colonoscopy bowel preparation. Gum chewing could be advised in addition to high-dose senna containing bowel preparation.",

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigated the immunological changes in the colon and skin after the administration of senna. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated the colon and epidermis of C57/BL6j mice after a single administration of 10 mg/kg of senna [Cassia angustifolia (Caesalpiniaceae); 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after administration] and after repeated once per week administrations (on days 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 of administration). The LD50 and ED50 of senna used in this experiment were 165 mg/kg and 13 g/kg, respectively. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the DOPA-positive cells in the colon increased at 12 h after single administration and were further increased from at 5-28 d after repeated administration. We also studied the physiological changes of the small intestine using the charcoal meal test. We found that there was a tendency for peristalsis to be inhibited after repeated senna administration. In the epidermis, we investigated the number of Langerhans cells, because they are important immune cells of the skin. The number of these cells decreased, especially after repeated administration.

The present study examined the anti-diabetic activity of the Senna singueana acetone fraction (SSAF) of stem bark in a type 2 diabetes (T2D) rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Crude ethyl acetate extract of the Senna singueana stem bark was fractionated with various solvents and the acetone fraction was selected for in vivo studies based on the high α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities. In the in vivo study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced with T2D and treated with the SSAF at 150 and 300 mg/kg body weight. Several T2D-related parameters were measured in the study. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of intervention, non-fasting blood glucose concentrations were significantly decreased and the glucose tolerance ability was significantly improved in the SSAF treated groups compared to the diabetic control group. Serum insulin concentrations, pancreatic β-cell function (HOMA-β) and liver glycogen were significantly (P<0.05) increased while serum alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and urea were significantly decreased in the SSAF treated diabetic rats compared to the diabetic control group. Though insignificantly (P>0.05), other T2D-induced abnormalities such as food and fluid intake, body weight, serum lipids, serum fructosamine level and peripheral insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were also partially ameliorated by the SSAF treatment. CONCLUSION: Data of this study suggest that orally administered SSAF could ameliorate most of the T2D-induced abnormalities in a T2D model of rats.",

OBJECTIVES: Comparing patients who received senna matched with similar patients who received other oral bowel medications, determine the subsequent risk of \"problematic constipation,\" assessed as the occurrence of the surrogate markers of receiving an enema, escalation of oral bowel medications, and abdominal radiographic imaging. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized pediatric oncology patients less than 21 years of age in 78 children's and adult hospitals between 2006 and 2011 who were started on seven consecutive days or more of opioid therapy and were started on an oral bowel medication within the first two days of opioid therapy. Clinically detailed administrative data were used from the Pediatric Health Information System and the Premier Perspective Database. After performing propensity score matching of similar patients who started senna and who started a different oral bowel medication, Cox regression modeling was used to compare the subsequent hazard of the surrogate markers. RESULTS: The final matched sample of 586 patients averaged 11.5 years of age (range 0-20 years); 41.8% (n = 245) had blood cancer, 50.3% (n = 295) had solid tumor cancer, and 7.9% (n = 46) had brain cancer. Initiating senna therapy within two days of starting the prolonged opioid course, compared with initiating another oral bowel medication, was significantly associated with a lower hazard during the ensuing five days for receipt of an enema (hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.91) or undergoing abdominal radiographic imaging (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.98), was marginally associated with a lower hazard of oral bowel medicine escalation (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59-1.03), and overall was significantly associated with a lower hazard of the composite end point of problematic constipation (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.88). CONCLUSION: Initiating senna therapy, compared with other oral bowel medications, diminishes the subsequent risk of surrogate markers of problematic constipation in this population.",

      "abstract": "Senna spectabilis (sin. Cassia excelsa, C. spectabilis) is an endemic tree of South America and Africa, very common in Brazil, where it is known as \"canafistula-de-besouro\" and \"cassia-do-nordeste\". In folk medicine, this plant is indicated for the treatment of constipation, insomnia, anxiety, epilepsy, malaria, dysentery and headache. Phytopharmacological studies have also confirmed anticonvulsive, sedative, anti-malarial, antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of many parts of S. spectabilis. In this communication, we present a comparative study of the leishmanicidal activity of the crude ethanolic extract, its fractions and also the two major alkaloidal metabolites (-)-cassine/(-)-spectaline, trying to establish a relationship between the presence of piperidine alkaloidal constituents and leishmanicidal activity. The growth inhibitory effect of promastigote forms of Leishmania major was determined for the crude extract, fractions of the flowers of S. spectabilis and a mixture of (-)-cassine/(-)-spectaline in comparison to pentamidine used as standard drug. The cytotoxic effects were assessed on macrophage strain J774 by lactate dehydrogenase assay. Fractions dichloromethane (FL-DCM) and n-butanol (FL-Bu) and a mixture of (-)-cassine/(-)-spectaline (∼7:3) exhibited significant activity against the parasite Leishmania major (IC50 values of 0.6±0.1 μg/ml, 1.6±0.9 μg/ml and 24.9±1.4 μg/ml, respectively), without toxic effects on murine macrophages. Due to the promising results elicited, further studies in vivo need to be performed to confirm the therapeutic potential of Senna spectabilis.",

Mortality of larvae exposed to the different extracts increased with increase in extract concentration and time of exposure. This study revealed a differential potency of the extracts used and a difference in susceptibility of larvae to the extracts as evident by the 72hLC₅₀ values obtained. The leaf extract proved to be more lethal to the larvae than the stem extract as judged by the 72hLC₅₀ values obtained both for the aqueous as well as the ethanolic extracts assayed. Phytochemical screening of the plant parts investigated revealed the presence of some plant metabolites, which have been reported in separate studies to be lethal to mosquito larvae. Results obtained from this study suggest that the leaf and stem extracts of S. alata possess a promising larvicidal potential which can be exploited in mosquito vector control.",

Increased use of senna was expected due to the removal of the stimulant laxatives danthron and phenolphthalein from the market. Senna was nominated for study by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to the wide use of laxative preparations, positive genotoxicity in vitro for some senna components or metabolites, and unknown carcinogenic potential. Because a 2-year rat study was ongoing by the manufacturer, the FDA requested that the NTP conduct a senna study in the p53(+/-) mouse. In this study, the potential for carcinogenic effects of senna was studied in the C3B6.129F1/Tac-Trp53tm1Brd N12 haploinsufficient (heterozygous F1 p53(+/-)) mouse model as an ongoing goal of the NTP to develop and test model systems for toxicology and carcinogenesis studies, especially those that can provide mechanistic information relative to understanding an agents mode of action. C57BL/6NTac mice were exposed to senna in feed for 5 weeks; heterozygous F1 p53(+/-) mice were exposed to senna in feed for 40 weeks.

METHODS: Eighty-two patients suffering from constipation after chemotherapy were assigned to Group AB and Group BA. Group AB referred to patients who first took senna extract in the 1st chemotherapeutic course and the crude fiber diet in the 2nd chemotherapeutic course. But the sequence was just the opposite in Group BA. The effective rates of relieving chemotherapy-induced constipation by senna extract and by the crude fiber diet were observed. The differences of the digestive tract reaction and the hematotoxicity reaction were compared. The conditions of patients' abdominal pain and stool properties were observed after they took senna extract. RESULTS: The effective rate of constipation by taking senna extract was 92.68% and that by the crude fiber diet was 10.93%, with statistical difference shown (P < 0.01). There was no statistic difference in adverse reaction rate such as decreased neutrophils over degree II, decreased hemoglobin, decreased platelet, nausea, vomit, etc. (P > 0.05). The occurrence rate of abdominal pain over degree II after taking senna was 8.54%. In the distribution of stool properties, the rate of loose stool was 35.53%.

Currently, there is no effective Western medical therapy for functional constipation and it significantly impacts the quality of life of the patients. Integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine therapies were reported to have better therapeutic effects than routine Western medicine therapies. OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of acupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine Plantain and Senna Granule in the treatment of functional constipation. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: A total of 390 patients with confirmed functional constipation enrolled from the Department of Gastroenterology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical College in China from February 2008 to January 2010 were randomly divided into three groups, with 130 cases in each group. Acupuncture group was treated with puncture of point Tianshu (ST25), Shangjuxu (ST37), Zusanli (ST36), Dachangyu (BL25) and Zhigou (SJ6) twice daily for four weeks, while Plantain and Senna Granule group was treated with 5 g of Plantain and Senna Granule once daily, and the combination group was given above-mentioned acupuncture and Plantain and Senna Granule. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The defecation cycle, stool property, constipation symptom, accompanying symptoms, gastrointestinal transit time, including total gastrointestinal transit time, mouth-intestine transit time, colonic transit time, right colonic transit time, left colonic transit time and rectosigmoid colonic transit time, and adverse reactions of the three groups were evaluated before treatment, at the end of treatment and 64 weeks after treatment, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, the scores of defecation cycle, stool property, constipation symptoms and accompanying symptoms, and gastrointestinal transit time all decreased significantly at the end of treatment in each group (P<0.01), and the combination group showed better results than the other groups (P<0.05). Compared with the end of treatment, the above-mentioned indexes recurred insignificantly in the combination group and acupuncture group after 64 weeks of follow-up (P>0.05), but all recurred significantly in the Plantain and Senna Granule group (P>0.05). Both short- and long-term total response rates of the combination group showed significant differences compared with those of the other two groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01). No serious adverse reactions occurred in all the three groups. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture plus Plantain and Senna Granule can significantly decrease gastrointestinal transit time and defecation cycle in patients with functional constipation; it can also change stool property and alleviate constipation symptom and accompanying symptoms, with good security and tolerance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Proteases play an important role in virulence of many human, plant and insect pathogens. The proteinaceous protease inhibitors of plant origin have been reported widely from many plant species. The inhibitors may potentially be used for multiple therapeutic applications in viral, bacterial, fungal diseases and physiological disorders. In traditional Indian medicine system, Cassia tora (Senna tora) is reportedly effective in treatment of skin and gastrointestinal disorders. The present study explores the protease inhibitory activity of the above plant seeds against trypsin, Aspergillus flavus and Bacillus sp. proteases. METHODS: The crushed seeds of Cassia tora were washed thoroughly with acetone and hexane for depigmentation and defatting. The proteins were fractionated by ammonium sulphate (0-30, 30-60, 60-90%) followed by dialysis and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The inhibitory potential of crude seed extract and most active dialyzed fraction against trypsin and proteases was established by spot test using unprocessed x-ray film and casein digestion methods, respectively. Electrophoretic analysis of most active fraction (30-60%) and SEC elutes were carried employing Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Gelatin SDS-PAGE. Inhibition of fungal spore germination was studied in the presence of dialyzed active inhibitor fraction. Standard deviation (SD) and ANOVA were employed as statistical tools. RESULTS: The crude seeds' extract displayed strong antitryptic, bacterial and fungal protease inhibitory activity on x-ray film. The seed protein fraction 30-60% was found most active for trypsin inhibition in caseinolytic assay (P < 0.001). The inhibition of caseinolytic activity of the proteases increased with increasing ratio of seed extract. The residual activity of trypsin, Aspergillus flavus and Bacillus sp. proteases remained only 4, 7 and 3.1%, respectively when proteases were incubated with 3 mg ml-1 seed protein extract for 60 min. The inhibitory activity was evident in gelatin SDS-PAGE where a major band (~17-19 kD) of protease inhibitor (PI) was detected in dialyzed and SEC elute. The conidial germination of Aspergillus flavus was moderately inhibited (30%) by the dialyzed seed extract. CONCLUSIONS: Cassia tora seed extract has strong protease inhibitory activity against trypsin, Aspergillus flavus and Bacillus sp. proteases. The inhibitor in Cassia tora may attenuate microbial proteases and also might be used as phytoprotecting agent.",

The crude extract exhibited an in vitro activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei as it completely eliminated parasites' motility within 10 minutes postincubation with 6.66 mg/ml of effective extract concentration. The extract was further used to treat experimentally T. brucei brucei infected rats at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight, beginning on day 5 post infections (p.i.). At the termination of the experiment on Day 11 p.i., the extract significantly (P < 0.05) kept the parasitemia lower than was recorded in the infected untreated rats. All the infected animals developed anemia, the severity of which was significantly (P < 0.05) ameliorated by the extract treatment. The infection caused significant (P < 0.05) increases in serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases as well as serum urea and creatinine levels. However, treatment of infected animals with the extract significantly (P < 0.05) prevented the trypanosome-induced increase in these biochemical indices. Furthermore, the T. brucei infection caused hepatomegaly and splenomegaly that were significantly (P < 0.05) ameliorated by the extract administration. It was concluded that orally administered ethanol extract of S. occidentalis leaf possessed anti-T. brucei brucei activity and could ameliorate the disease-induced anemia and organ damage."

      "abstract": "Previously, the possible teratogenic effect of frequently used laxative drug, senna has not been checked in case-control epidemiological study. Objective of the study was the comparison of cases with congenital abnormalities (CAs) and their matched controls without CAs in the population-based large data set of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance System of Congenital Abnormalities. Of 22,843 cases with CA, 506 (2.2%) had mothers with senna treatment, while of 38,151 control newborn infants without CA, 937 (2.5%) were born to mothers with senna treatment (adjusted OR with 95% CI: 1.0, 0.9-1.1), and of 834 malformed controls with Down syndrome, 26 (3.1%) had mothers with the use of senna (OR with 95% CI: 0.7, 0.5-1.1). The range of senna doses was between 10mg and 30 mg, but most pregnant women used 20mg daily. The mothers with senna treatment showed the characteristics of pregnant women with constipation (elder with larger proportion of primiparae). There was no higher risk for 23 different CA groups after the senna treatment during the second and/or third gestational month of 260 mothers, i.e. in the critical period of most major CAs, compared with their 500 matched controls. Gestational age at delivery was somewhat longer (0.2 week) and the rate of preterm birth was lower (6.6% vs. 9.2%) in newborn infants without CA born to mothers with senna treatment compared with babies born to mothers without senna treatment. In conclusion, senna treatment did not associate with a higher risk of CAs in the offspring of pregnant women with constipation.",

      "abstract": "Sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia L.) is an invasive weed species especially of soybean and other field crops in the southeastern United States. The seeds contain a small amount (5-7%) of a highly colored fat as well as various phenolics, proteins, and galactomannans. The color of sicklepod seed oil is such that the presence of a small amount of the weed seed in a soybean crush lowers the quality of the soybean oil. Sicklepod is very prolific, and even volunteer stands yield >1000 lb of seed per acre, and prudence calls for tapping the potential of this weed as an alternative economic crop in the affected region. Pursuant to this, we have shown in laboratory-scale work the feasibility of separating the components of sicklepod seed. However, at kilogram and higher processing quantities, difficulties arise leading to modification of the earlier approach in order to efficiently separate components of the defatted seed meal. In a version for cleanly separating the proteins, the defatted meal was extracted with 0.5 M NaCl solution to remove globular proteins. Prolamins were extracted from the pellet left after salt extraction using 80% ethanol, and glutelins were then obtained in 0.1 N alkali from the residual solids left from ethanol treatment. In a pilot-scale version for water-soluble polysaccharides, the defatted meal was stirred with deionized water (DI) and centrifuged. The pooled centrifugates were heated to 92 degrees C (20-25 min), filtered, cooled to room temperature, and passed through a column of Amberlite XAD-4 to separate the polysaccharides from the anthraquinones. Senna obtusifolia L. is a one-stop-shop of a seed (from food components to medicinals).",

The highest germination percentage (77.19%), the best germination rate (16 days) and the highest growth rate (69.01%) were obtained from Colutea armena seeds that were submersed in sulphuric acid for 30 min and sown in the greenhouse. The pre-treatment of submersion in sulphuric acid for 20 min with cold stratification for 60 days gave the highest germination percentage (82.77%) and the highest growth rate (79.37%) in the greenhouse for Cotinus coggygria seeds. On the other hand, the best germination rate (9 days) was obtained from smoketree seeds that were cold stratified 60 days and sown under open field conditions.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and patient acceptance of an oral high dose of senna to conventional polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ES) in adults undergoing elective colonoscopy. METHODS: Consecutive outpatients referred for elective colonoscopy were prospectively randomly assigned to receive, the day before the procedure, either 24 tablets of 12 mg senna, divided into two doses at 1 p.m. and 9 p.m. (senna group, n=191), or standard 4-L PEG-ES (PEG-ES group, n=92). The overall quality of colon cleansing (primary outcome measure) and cleansing in the right colon were evaluated using the Aronchick scoring scale (1=excellent to 4=inadequate) by the investigator/endoscopist who was blinded to the treatment assignment. Patient acceptance and the safety of the preparation were assessed by a nurse, using a structured questionnaire covering compliance with the dosing, overall tolerance of the preparation (1=none or mild discomfort to 4=severely distressing), and adverse events. RESULTS: The quality of colon cleansing, overall tolerance of the preparation, and compliance were significantly better with senna; overall cleansing was excellent or good in 90.6% of patients in the senna group and in 79.7% in the PEG-ES group (p= 0.003). The percentage of procedures rescheduled because of insufficient colon cleansing was 7.3% in the PEG-ES group and 2.6% in the senna group (p=0.035). Multivariate logistic regression modeling showed the PEG-ES preparation as negative independent predictor of unsuccessful bowel cleansing. The incidence of adverse reactions was similar in the two groups; patients who received senna experienced significantly less nausea and vomiting, but more abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: An oral high dose of senna is a valid alternative to standard PEG-ES for outpatient colonoscopy preparation.",

      "abstract": "Senna (Tinnevelly senna fruits), a known laxative derived from plants, was administered by gavage to Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD (SD) BR) rats once daily at dose levels of 0, 25, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day for up to 104 consecutive weeks. Based upon clinical signs related to the laxation effect of senna, the highest dose (300 mg/kg/day) was considered to be a maximum tolerated dose. Sixty animals per sex were assigned to the control and dose groups. Assessments included clinical chemistry, hematology, full histology (control and high-dose groups; in addition, low and mid dose: intestinal tract, adrenals, liver, kidneys, brain and gross lesions) and toxicokinetics. The primary treatment-related clinical observation was mucoid feces seen at 300 mg/kg/day. When compared to controls, animals administered 300 mg/kg/day had slightly reduced body weights, increased water consumption and notable changes in electrolytes in serum (increases in potassium and chloride) and urine (decreases in sodium, potassium and chloride). The changes in electrolytes are most likely physiologic adaptations to the laxative effect of senna. At necropsy, dark discoloration of the kidneys was observed in animals in all treated groups. Histological changes were seen in the kidneys of animals from all treated groups and included slight to moderate tubular basophilia and tubular pigment deposits. In addition, for all treated groups, minimal to slight hyperplasia was evident in the colon and cecum. These histological changes, together with the changes seen in the evaluation of clinical chemistry and urine parameters, have been shown to be reversible in a previous 13-week rat study of senna. No treatment-related neoplastic changes were observed in any of the examined organs. Based upon these data, it is concluded that senna is not carcinogenic even after daily administration for 2 years at dosages of up to 300 mg/kg/day in Sprague-Dawley rats.",

To evaluate the carcinogenic potential of anthraquinones, the effect of long-term senna pod extract (SE) treatment on either healthy rats or rats treated with an initiating tumor agent (azoxymethane--AOM) has been studied. SE (30 and 60mg/kg), administered for 110 weeks, did not induce the development of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and tumors in healthy rats. The development of ACF and tumors in rats treated with AOM were significantly reduced by SE (30 and 60 mg/kg). These results suggest that a chronic SE use does not predispose to colon cancer. By contrast, SE might exert an anti-tumoral activity on rat colon carcinogenesis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report a case of chronic ingestion of very large amounts of senna fruits as an herbal tea, possibly leading to severe hepatotoxicity. CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old woman who had ingested, for >3 years, one liter of an herbal tea each day made from a bag containing 70 g of dry senna fruits, developed acute hepatic failure and renal impairment requiring intensive care therapy. The severity of the hepatic failure was reflected by the increase in prothrombin time (international normalized ratio >7) and the development of encephalopathy. Liver transplantation was discussed, but the patient ultimately recovered with supportive therapy. Renal impairment was consistent with proximal tubular acidosis, also with marked polyuria refractory to vasopressin administration. Suprisingly, large amounts of cadmium were transiently recovered in the urine. DISCUSSION: Cassia acutifolia and angustifolia plants are widely used as laxatives. Their chronic abuse may be associated with serious manifestations, including fluid and electrolyte loss, with chronic diarrhea. Severe hepatotoxicity is unusual, but could be explained by the exposure of the liver to unusual amounts of toxic metabolites of anthraquinone glycosides (sennosides). An objective causality assessment suggests that hepatotoxicity was possibly related to senna laxative abuse. Regarding nephrotoxicity, there are no available human data on sennosides, while experimental models suggest that anthraquinone derivatives may also accumulate in the kidneys. The finding of high urinary concentrations of cadmium would suggest contamination of the herbal tea by metals, but this hypothesis could not be verified. CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of large doses of senna laxatives may expose people to the risk of hepatotoxicity.",

At both the terminal and recovery phase necropsy, an increase in absolute and relative kidney weights was seen for male and female animals receiving 750 and/or 1500 mg/kg per day. A dark discoloration of the kidneys was observed at necropsy along with histopathological changes in the kidneys (slight to moderate tubular basophilia and pigment deposits) at 300 mg/kg and above.

The objectives of this study were to describe the effects of the treatment with seeds and its fraction external tegument (TE) on the development of chicks and their lymphoid organs bursa of Fabricius and spleen. Chicks that received a commercial ration with 1% TE had reduced body and lymphoid organ weights. The bursa of Fabricius presented reduction in the diameters of the follicles, and in the thickness of the cortical and medullary regions. The spleen presented depleted lymphoid tissue in the white pulp. These results indicate that the active principle of S. occidentalis is more concentrated on its TE fraction, and that it can cause weight loss as well as alterations in the lymphoid organs in chicks.

This is opposed to what is observed by using oxytetracycline, terramycin long-acting (TLA), or procaine-penicillin, antibiotics commonly used parenterally for the treatment of dermatophilosis in the Republic of Benin which could not prevent the recurrence of the disease. These ointments, when applied once a day for 8-15 days, provoked the falling off of the crusts after 3-4 days of treatment. Hair grows on the treated areas, which heal without scarring, within 3-4 weeks after the end of the treatment. The healed animals became free of dermatophilosis without recurrence for more than 3 years and were in good health.",

      "abstract": "• Senna obtusifolia (sicklepod) is a troublesome weed in many agronomic cropping systems in the southeastern USA with varying fertility regimes. This series of experiments was initiated to determine the impact of nutrient availability on reproductive output and maternal effects. • Experiments were conducted with plants growing in soil in growth chambers for 120 d. Offspring growth was evaluated in hydroponics. • Plants grown under higher nutrient conditions had greater reproductive biomass, number of seeds and total seed biomass. Individual seed mass distributions were slightly affected, with negative skewness decreased at higher nutrition. Seed germination rates were influenced primarily by seed size, as small seeds germinated faster than large seeds. The nitrogen content of seeds increased with increasing seed size and was higher in the high nutrition treatment. Seedlings arising from maternal plants grown under high nutrition grew more rapidly than did seedlings arising from maternal plants grown in a low nutrient regime. • The results suggest that S. obtusifolia reproduction and offspring competitiveness can be strongly influenced by the fertilization regimes used in different agronomic crops and rotations."

This study was undertaken to determine if the chronic treatment with S. occidentalis seeds of rats (as a mammalian model) would induce a mitochondrial myopathy similar to those described in humans and to determine if the histological changes could be correlated with the amount of ingested seeds. Twenty-one days old rats were fed S. occidentalis seeds at different diet concentrations (1, 2, 3%). Rats fed 1% S. occidentalis seeds had only a few COX-negative muscle fibers in the pectoralis major muscle. Rats fed 3% Senna occidentalis seeds had a greater number of COX-negative fibers. Rats fed 2% had an intermediate number of COX-negative fibers. Activity of SDH and NADH-tr were decreased in rats of groups 2% and 3%. Our data indicate that a progressive mitochondrial metabolism impairment can be produced in rats fed S. occidentalis seeds and that this impairment can be correlated with the amount of ingested seeds.",

SETTING: Multicenter study (18 centers). PATIENTS: Five hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with colonic or rectal carcinoma or sigmoid diverticular disease, undergoing elective colonic or rectal resection followed by immediate anastomosis. INTERVENTION: Two hundred sixty-two patients were randomly allotted to receive senna (1 package diluted in a glass of water) and 261 to receive polyethylene glycol (2 packages diluted in 2-3 L of water), administered the evening before surgery. All patients received 5% povidone iodine antiseptic enemas (2 L) the evening and the morning before surgery. Ceftriaxone sodium and metronidazole were given intravenously at anesthetic induction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Degree of colonic and rectal cleanliness. RESULTS: Colonic cleanliness was better (P=.006), fecal matter in the colonic lumen was less fluid (P=.001), and the risk for moderate or large intraoperative fecal soiling was lower (P=.11) with senna. Overall, clinical tolerance did not differ significantly between groups, but 20 patients receiving polyethylene glycol (vs 16 with senna) had to interrupt their preparation, and 15 patients (vs 8 with senna) complained of abdominal distension. Senna, however, was better tolerated (P = .03) in the presence of stenosis. There was no statistically significant difference found in the number of patients with postoperative infective complications (14.7% vs 17.7%) or anastomotic leakage (5.3% vs 5.7%) with senna and polyethylene glycol, respectively. CONCLUSION: Mechanical preparation before colonic or rectal resection with senna is better and easier than with polyethylene glycol and should be proposed in patients undergoing colonic or rectal resection, especially patients with stenosis.",

This comparative study was conducted with the objective of determining treatment and cost efficiency for senna and lactulose in terminal cancer patients treated with opioids. The methodology used a randomized, open, parallel group design. The study was conducted in the Palliative Care Unit in one Madrid Health Care District. Ninety-one terminal cancer patients were randomized into two groups: A = treated with senna (starting with 0.4 mL daily), and B = treated with lactulose (starting with 15 mL daily) for a 27-day period. The main outcome measures were defecation-free intervals of 72 hr, days with defecation, general health status, and treatment cost. Laxative efficacy was analyzed through t test and analysis of variance. No difference was found between the laxatives in defecation-free intervals or in days with defecation. The final scores for general health status were similar in both groups. Given that the two treatments have similar efficacy and adverse effects, a recommendation is made for the use of senna because its cost is lower than lactulose.",

Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and senna, which, experimentally, induce ulcerative colitis and melanosis coli, respectively, were chosen for examination, since these substances are visible under the microscope without any special treatment. DSS (MW 50,000) and senna were orally administered to guinea pigs. In tissue sections of the intestine, the presence of DSS was demonstrated by toluidine blue staining, while senna was visible under the light microscope as brown pigment. In the large intestine of guinea pigs, macrophages were most numerous in the cecum, decreasing in number towards the rectum. Metachromatic reaction due to DSS was first recognized in the epithelium of the cecum, and was subsequently incorporated by macrophages. The presence of DSS, either in the epithelium or in macrophages, was not recognized in the small intestine or the distal colon. Senna pigmentation was also limited to the cecum and proximal colon, in which pigmented macrophages aggregated in the lamina propria. The two different substances administered orally were taken up in the cecum, and partly also in the proximal colon; the substances passed through the epithelium and were incorporated by macrophages. This finding suggests the existence of a weak point in the intestinal barrier in this particular portion of the intestine.",

A single or a prolonged oral administration of senna (60-240 mg/kg) to animals did not increase intestinal PAF content. Nor did senna increase the intraluminal release of acid phosphatase. A similar result was obtained in the colonic tissue of rat perfused in vitro with rhein (1-500 micrograms/ml) or rhein anthrone (1-500 micrograms/ml). In contrast, a single oral administration of phenolphthalein (20 mg/kg), bile salts (20 mg/kg) or magnesium sulfate (30 mg/kg) to rats increased intestinal PAF content. Magnesium sulfate also increased the intraluminal release of acid phosphatase. Colonic tissue of rats perfused in vitro with calcium ionophore A23187 (10 micrograms/ml) formed large amounts of PAF and acid phosphatase. PAF stimulates intestinal motility and secretion and mediates gut damage while acid phosphatase is a marker of cellular damage. Therefore, our data suggest that senna is well tolerated in animals and PAF does not mediate senna-induced laxation.",

DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, cross over study. SETTING: Four hospitals in Northern Ireland, one hospital in England, and two nursing homes in England. SUBJECTS: 77 elderly patients with a history of chronic constipation in long term hospital or nursing home care. INTERVENTION: A senna-fibre combination (10 ml daily) or lactulose (15 ml twice daily) with matching placebo for two 14 day periods, with 3-5 days before and between treatments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stool frequency, stool consistency, and ease of evacuation; deviation from recommended dose; daily dose and cost per stool; adverse effects. RESULTS: Mean daily bowel frequency was greater with the senna-fibre combination (0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 0.9) than lactulose (0.6, 0.5 to 0.7; t = 3.51 p < or = 0.001). Scores for stool consistency and ease of evacuation were significantly higher for the senna-fibre combination than for lactulose. The recommended dose was exceeded more frequently with lactulose than the senna-fibre combination (chi 2 = 8.38, p or = 0.01). As an index of the standard daily dose, the dose per stool was 1.52 for lactulose and 0.97 for the senna-fibre combination, at a cost per stool of 39.7p for lactulose and 10.3p for senna-fibre. Adverse effects were no different for the two treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments were effective and well tolerated for chronic constipation in long stay elderly patients. The senna-fibre combination was significantly more effective than lactulose at a lower cost.",

Both laxatives increased defecation frequency and wet and dry stool weights although the added effect of the senna was clearly evident. Only the psyllium with senna increased stool moisture. Two distinct responses to the psyllium plus senna were evident; the subpopulation of high responders (n = 7) was responsible for most of the increase in stool frequency and dry weight in this group, and laxation in the subpopulation of normal responders (n = 12) was similar to that observed in those receiving psyllium alone. Both laxatives provided a similarly high degree of subjective relief and improvement in stool consistency. When constipation was assessed objectively by stool frequency and weight, laxation was attained by 63% of the psyllium plus senna group and 48% of the psyllium group.",
