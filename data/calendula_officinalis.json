      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Despite evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of Calendula officinalis, well-designed and controlled studies are still needed to confirm its beneficial effects on various health conditions, including skin care. This study therefore evaluates the effectiveness of topically administered 5% aqueous Calendula officinalis extract on healing full-thickness skin wounds in male BALB/c mice. METHODS: Seventy-two mice were divided into three groups: CAL (treated with calendula extract), PSS (treated with physiological saline), and NC (negative control/no treatment). Wound healing was assessed over 14 days using planimetric measurements, counting fibroblasts and macrophages, biochemical analyses of growth factors, inflammation markers, hydroxyproline levels, and genomic analyses. RESULTS: The data obtained show that the application of CAL extract significantly reduces wound areas by day 7 compared to the NC and PSS groups. CAL extract also leads to an increase in fibroblasts, fibroblast growth factor, and hydroxyproline levels, while it reduces macrophages and inflammatory biomarkers levels in the healing wound. Genomic analyses indicate that topical application of CAL extract significantly reduces the expression of inflammatory biomarkers, including matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that 5% aqueous CAL extract enhances wound healing promising new insights for the effective topical treatment of skin wounds."

      "abstract": "Calendula officinalis has anti microbial and anti inflammatory property and its usage for wound healing is the need of the hour. The ultimate aim of our research study was to evaluate and compare bilateral earlobe rejuvenation with and without Calendula officinalis. The purpose of the study was to examine the impact of calendula on wound healing and its effect in the duration of wound healing. This randomised control trial was conducted on patients with bilateral earlobe cleft and were advised for the treatment of earlobe repair. The technique used for repair was Cross Stitching Approach modified with subcutaneus suturing. The randomization for the calendula application and sequence was generated randomly by computer generated random numbering. Calendula ointment was placed in a double blinded manner by blinding the principal investigator and the statistician. Calendula ointment was applied every 12 hourly on one ear lobe for a period of 7 days and petroleum jelly was placed on the contralateral earlobe. Scar assessment was done using the Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale (SBSE) on 15th day postoperatively. The wound healing after earlobe repair in 35 patients was compared after 24 h, 7 days, and 15 days using an unpaired t test in this randomized control trial. Statistical significance was defined as a P-value of less than 0.01. The repeated measures ANOVA test was used to compare mean scores at different time intervals in groups 1 and 2. The Bon Feronic test was used to compare the mean score in groups 1 and 2 at different time intervals. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value of less than 0.01. The comparison of mean score on day 1 the (p value = 0.525), day 7 was (p value = 0.324) and day 15 which was clinically significant (p value < 0.001). Calendula ointment was found to be beneficial in wound healing after cleft earlobe repair in this study. Calendula ointment has demonstrated potential benefits in treating wounds in scheduled surgery with no post-operative problems, according to the findings of this study. This study sets the landmark for the use of Calendula ointment in the treatment of cleft earlobe rejuvenation in Maxillofacial surgery."

      "abstract": "Pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) is an herbaceous ornamental and medicinal plant. Climate models predict a reduction of precipitations and increasing the average temperature. Therefore, agricultural plants will be more frequently exposed to water deficit stress. To investigate the influence of nano-silicon foliar application (0, 50, 100, and 200 mg L- 1) on the alleviation of drought stress (100, 75, and 50% Field capacity (FC)) adverse effects on marigold plant characteristics, a factorial experiment was conducted based on a completely randomized design with three replications. The chlorophyll content of plants treated with nano-silicon 200 mg L- 1 decreased by 8.39% when drought stress increased from 100 to 50% FC. In line with electrolyte leakage percentage, the highest malondialdehyde and H2O2 content was measured in non-treated plants under a drought level of 50% FC. The activity of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase enzymes increased with increasing nano-silicon concentration and drought stress severity. Under all levels of nano-silicon treatment, the cell's abscisic acid content increased with increasing drought severity. Also, the highest abscisic acid content was measured in plants treated with nano-silicon 100 and 200 mg L- 1. There was a significant negative correlation between electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde and H2O2 content, and morphological characteristics, photosynthetic pigments content, total protein, and antioxidant enzymes activity. The positive effect of nano-silicon application is correlated with enhancing antioxidant enzymes activity, membrane stability, and cell osmotic potential. Also, one of the most critical mechanisms of silicon's effect on the alleviation of stress damage is the regulation of abscisic acid signaling. As a result, foliar application of nano-silicon could be introduced as a promising and influential technique to overcome the adverse effects of drought stress on morpho-physiological and biochemical characteristics of the marigold plant.",

METHODS: Considering this information, we synthesized Calendula officinalis-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CO-CSNPs) via the ionic gelation method. Their characterizations were carried out with ZetaSizer, UV-Vis, FTIR and SEM devices including size, morphology and surface zeta potential analysis, loading capacity, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro drug release, and chemical interactions. The anticancer activities of CO, CSNPs, and CO-CSNPs were tested against AGS, Caco-2, and normal NIH-3T3 cells using an XTT assay. The anticancer effects were evaluated using DAPI staining, scratch assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection and the CUPRAC method on cellular and non-cellular processes that promote anticancer mechanisms. RESULTS: Results showed that CO and CO-CNPs exhibited anticancer activity against AGS and Caco-2. Further, the formulation of CO with CSNPs enhanced the anticancer activity of CO while having no cytotoxicity on NIH-3T3. DAPI staining, scratch assay, ROS, and CUPRAC method confirmed the anticancer activity of CO and CO-CSNPs, which resulted in a reduction in the number of apoptotic cells, inhibited migration, triggered apoptotic pathway via ROS, and higher antioxidant activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that CO-CSNPs are a promising therapeutic formulation for gastric and colon cancer treatment. We consider that this study will lead to the investigation of molecular mechanisms of CO-CSNPs in cancer treatment and their investigation in clinical studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soil contamination with heavy metals poses a significant threat to plant health and human well-being. This study explores the potential of nano silica as a solution for mitigating heavy metal uptake in Calendula officinalis. RESULTS: Greenhouse experiments demonstrated, 1000 mg•kg- 1 nano silica caused a 6% increase in soil pH compared to the control treatment. Also in 1000 mg. kg- 1 nano silica, the concentrations of available Pb (lead), Zn (zinc), Cu (copper), Ni (nickel), and Cr (chromium) in soil decreased by 12%, 11%, 11.6%, 10%, and 9.5%, respectively, compared to the control. Nano silica application significantly reduces heavy metal accumulation in C. officinalis exposed to contaminated soil except Zn. In 1000 mg.kg- 1 nano silica shoots Zn 13.28% increased and roots Zn increased 13% compared to the control treatment. Applying nano silica leads to increase the amount of phosphorus (P) 25%, potassium (K) 26% uptake by plant, In 1000 mg.kg - 1 treatment the highest amount of urease enzyme activity was 2.5%, dehydrogenase enzyme activity, 23.6% and the highest level of alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity was 13.5% higher than the control treatment. CONCLUSION: Nano silica, particularly at a concentration of 1000 mg.kg - 1, enhanced roots and shoots length, dry weight, and soil enzyme activity Moreover, it increased P and K concentrations in plant tissues while decreasing heavy metals uptake by plant.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among different adsorbents, natural and inorganic compounds such as diatomite are important and advantageous in terms of high efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and function in stabilizing heavy metals in the environment. Calendula officinalis, a plant known as a high accumulator of heavy metals, was cultivated in soil treated with varying concentrations of modified diatomite to demonstrate the efficiency of modified diatomite in stabilizating of heavy metals in soils, RESULTS: The modification of diatomite aimed to enhance Calendula officinalis adsorptive properties, particularly towards heavy metals such as lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn), Chromium (Cr), Nickle (Ni), and Copper (Cu), common contaminants in industrial soils. The experimental design included both control and treated soil samples, with assessments at regular intervals. Modified diatomite significantly decreased the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in contaminated soils except Zn, evidenced by decreased DTPA extractable heavy metals in soil and also heavy metal concentrations in plant tissues. Using 10% modified diatomite decreased 91% Pb and Cu, 78% Cr, and 79% Ni concentration of plants compared to the control treatment. The highest concentration of Zn in plant tissue was observed in 2.5% modified diatomite treatment. Remarkably, the application of modified diatomite also appeared to improve the nutrient profile of the soil, leading to enhanced uptake of key nutrients like phosphorus (P) 1.18%, and potassium (K) 79.6% in shoots and 82.3% in roots in Calendula officinalis. Consequently, treated plants exhibited improved growth characteristics, including shoots and roots height of 16.98% and 12.8% respectively, and shoots fresh and dry weight of 48.5% and 50.2% respectively., compared to those in untreated, contaminated soil. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest promising implications for using such amendments in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture, particularly in areas impacted by industrial pollution.",

In this study, we examined the anti-PD activity of C. officinalis flower extracts and investigated their bioactive compounds and molecular mechanisms based on LC-MS/MS assay, bioinformatic exploration and in vitro treatment of SH-SY5Y cells. C. officinalis extracts exhibited significant positive effects on the length and fluorescence density of the dopaminergic neuron region in zebrafish larvae. At 10 μg/mL, the extract restored the length to 96.54% and fluorescence density to 87.77% of the control values, which was equivalent to the effect of a positive drug, indicating the extract's powerful potential to alleviate PD symptoms. Five active compounds, including chlorogenic acid, 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid (DA), rutin, isorhamnetin 3-O-glucoside (IG) and calenduloside E (CE) were identified in extracts by LC-QTOF-MS/MS. Hsp90α, PI3K and ERK were revealed as core targets of DA, IG and CE in relation to anti-PD activity. The compounds docked deeply within the pocket region of Hsp90α protein, and their binding energies (∆G b) were -6.93 kcal/mol (DA), -6.51 kcal/mol (IG) and -3.03 kcal/mol (CE), respectively. Subsequently, they concurrently activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibited the ERK signaling pathway, thereby preventing neuronal death and alleviating neuronal degeneration. These compounds from C. officinalis could be potent nutraceutical agents with protective properties that may shield dopaminergic neurons against the damage caused by PD. Our findings provide a basis for utilizing the C. officinalis flowers in functional foods."

Due to an increase in chemical resistance, phytotherapeutic remedies have become an alternative for the prophylaxis and therapy of digestive parasitosis, albeit few remedies have been subjected to scientific validation. Low-input swine farming in Romania has adopted the traditional use of phytotherapy for controlling pathogens in livestock. The current study aimed to assess the antiparasitic potential of Calendula officinalis and Satureja hortensis against digestive parasites of swine in two low-input farms. The fecal samples were collected from sows, fatteners, and weaners, and were tested using the following coproparasitological methods: centrifugal sedimentation, flotation (Willis, McMaster egg counting technique), Ziehl-Neelsen stain modified by Henricksen, modified Blagg method, and in vitro nematode larvae/protozoan oocyst cultures. Six species of digestive parasites were diagnosed, namely Ascaris suum, Trichuris suis, Oesophagostomum spp., Balantioides coli, Eimeria spp., and Cryptosporidium spp., in various combinations, dependent on the swine category. A dose of 140 mg/kg bw/day of C. officinalis and 100 mg/kg bw/day of S. hortensis powders administered for 10 consecutive days revealed a strong antiprotozoal and anthelmintic activity on the aforementioned parasites. The curative efficacy can be attributed to the presence of polyphenols, sterols, tocopherols, and methoxylated flavones. In conclusion, our results indicate that S. hortensis and C. officinalis are promising alternatives to the commercially available antiparasitics, enabling their use as natural antiparasitic products against gastrointestinal parasites in pigs."

      "abstract": "The skin, the body's largest organ, acts as a protective barrier against pathogens and environmental damage. Skin burns can result from heat, chemicals, friction, or electricity. Nanoscience has recently been utilized to create ointments and creams for burns. Zinc oxide nanoparticles are crucial due to their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. In this study, a cream containing nanoparticles was loaded with calendula extract, and its ability to promote tissue healing was investigated in Wistar rats with skin burns. The zinc oxide nanoparticles were chemically synthesized and loaded with calendula extract. The morphology and physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles were confirmed by SEM, ZETA size, XRD, and FTIR assays. The MTT technique was employed to assess the cream's impact on fibroblast growth. The antimicrobial activity of the nanoparticles was investigated against Pseudomonas using the MIC method. Real-time PCR was used to determine the expression of the Bax and Bcl-2 genes in aeruginosa. The results showed that zinc oxide nanoparticles at high concentrations increased the proliferation of the fibroblast cells. Histopathological studies showed granulation and epithelialization of the tissue without any hemorrhage or tissue infection during the first days of treatment with this cream. The animal models treated with the cream showed an increase in Bcl-2 gene expression and a decrease in Bax expression. We concluded that zinc oxide nanoparticles loaded with calendula extract have a practical effect in healing burn wounds due to their unique antibacterial properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles and their anti-inflammatory and wound-healing effects. The synergistic effect of these two substances significantly improved the healing process. This newly developed cream can be introduced as a successful and viable treatment option in burn wounds.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chitosan, a deacetylated derivative of chitin, is one of the most preferred biopolymers for use as biostimulants and biofertilizers in organic agriculture and as elicitors to enhance the productivity of plant in vitro cultures. Valued as a non-toxic, biodegradable, and environment-friendly agent, it is widely applied to improve plant growth and yield, the content of bioactive specialized metabolites, and resistance to stress conditions and pathogens. However, the influence of chitosan on the growth-defense trade-off, particularly the interplay between steroid and triterpenoid metabolism, has not been extensively investigated. RESULTS: In this study, Calendula officinalis pot plants and hairy root cultures exposed to chitosan treatment displayed reduced biomass and altered steroid and triterpenoid metabolism. Biosynthesis and accumulation of free forms of sterols (particularly stigmasterol) were inhibited, while the content of sterol esters increased remarkably. The content of some triterpenoids (mainly free triterpenoid acids) was slightly enhanced; however, the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins was negatively affected. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in certain plants, chitosan treatment might not positively influence the growth and metabolite production. Therefore, to avoid unexpected effects, initial studies of the conditions of chitosan treatment are recommended, including the dose and the number of chitosan applications, the type of treatment (e.g., foliar or soil), and the vegetative stage of the treated plants.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. However, effective preventative or therapeutic agents for PD remain largely limited. Marigold Calendula officinalis L. (CoL) has been reported to possess a wide range of biological activities, but its neuroprotective activity including anti-neurodegenerative diseases is unclear. Here, we aim to investigate whether the extract of CoL (ECoL) has therapeutic activity on PD. METHODS: We identified the chemical composition of flavonoid, an important active ingredient in ECoL, by a targeted HPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis. Subsequently, we evaluated the anti-PD effect of ECoL by using zebrafish PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). After ECoL+MPTP co-treatments, the changes of dopaminergic neurons, neural vasculature, nervous system, and locomotor activity were examined, respectively. The expressions of genes related to neurodevelopment and autophagy were detected by RT-qPCR. Further, the interaction between autophagy regulators and ECoL flavonoids was predicted using molecular docking method. RESULTS: As a result, 5 kinds of flavonoid were identified in ECoL, consisting of 121 flavones and flavonols, 32 flavanones, 22 isoflavonoids, 11 chalcones and dihydrochalcones, and 17 anthocyanins. ECoL significantly ameliorated the loss of dopaminergic neurons and neural vasculature, restored the injury of nervous system, and remarkably reversed the abnormal expressions of neurodevelopment-related genes. Besides, ECoL notably inhibited the locomotor impairment in MPTP-induced PD-like zebrafish. The underlying anti-PD effect of ECoL may be implicated in activating autophagy, as ECoL significantly upregulated the expressions of genes related to autophagy, which contributes to the degradation of α-synuclein aggregation and dysfunctional mitochondria. Molecular docking simulation showed the stable interaction between autophagy regulators (Pink, Ulk2, Atg7, and Lc3b) and 10 main compounds of flavonoid in ECoL, further affirming the involvement of autophagy activation by ECoL in anti-PD action. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that ECoL has the anti-PD effect, and ECoL might be a promising therapeutic candidate for PD treatment."

During our previous study, it was observed that heavy metal resistant Burkholderia cepacia CS8 augmented growth and phytoremediation capability of an ornamental plant. Objective of the present research work was to evaluate the capability of B. cepacia CS8 assisted Calendula officinalis plants for the phytoremediation of tannery solid waste (TSW) polluted soil. The TSW treatment significantly reduced growth attributes and photosynthetic pigments in C. officinalis. However, supplementation of B. cepacia CS8 which exhibited substantial tolerance to the TSW amended soil, augmented growth traits, carotenoid, proline, and antioxidant enzymes level in C. officinalis under toxic and nontoxic regimes. Inoculation of B. cepacia CS8 augmented plant growth (shoot length 13%, root length 11%), physiological attributes (chlorophyll a 14%, chlorophyll b 17%), antioxidant enzyme activities (peroxidase 24%, superoxide dismutase 31% and catalase 19%), improved proline 36%, phenol 32%, flavonoids 14% and declined malondialdehyde (MDA) content 15% and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) level 12% in C. officinalis at TSW10 stress compared with relevant un-inoculated plants of TSW10 treatment. Moreover, B. cepacia CS8 application enhanced labile metals in soil and subsequent metal uptake, such as Cr 19%, Cd 22%, Ni 35%, Fe 18%, Cu 21%, Pb 34%, and Zn 30%, respectively in C. officinalis plants subjected to TSW10 stress than that of analogous un-inoculated treatment. Higher plant stress tolerance and improved phytoremediation potential through microbial inoculation will assist in the retrieval of agricultural land in addition to the renewal of native vegetation.",

METHOD: In this clinical trial, 60 patients hospitalized in the burn ward who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to two groups: intervention (n = 30) and control (n = 30). In addition to treatments, the intervention group received one capsule (2 g) of Calendula officinalis daily, for two weeks, and the control group received the placebo. Wound status was assessed with the Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT) on the 1st, 7th, and 15th days of the study in both groups. RESULTS: The mean total score of wound status using BWAT at the 1st, 7th, and 14th days in the intervention group was 48.23, 35.93, and 22.97, respectively, and in the control group was 48.90, 42.57, and 37.8. Statistically, wound condition on the first day was at the same level for both groups. Wound healing scores in the two groups increased during the 1st to 15th days of the study (P <0.001). However, in the intervention group, the range of wound healing changed on days seven and 15 and was greater than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, C. officinalis may have beneficial healing properties and be effective in accelerating the healing of second-degree burn wounds and can be used as a supplement to treat wounds."

Today, using medicinal plants instead of chemical drugs could be an alternative treatment option for PCOS. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Calendula officinalis hydroalcoholic extract on PCOS in rats. METHOD: 60 female adult rats were randomly divided into six groups, including control, sham, PCOS group, and treated PCOS groups receiving hydroalcoholic extract of Calendula officinalis with different dosages of 200, 500, and 1000 mg/kg. PCOS was induced by subcutaneous injection of DHEA 6 mg/100 g bw for 35 days. For two weeks, the extract was taken orally. The serum glucose, insulin, sex hormone levels, and oxidative status were measured at the end of the experiment. The ovaries were dissected for histomorphometric and pathological analysis. RESULTS: When compared to the control and sham groups, the PCOS group showed a significant increase in glucose, insulin, testosterone, and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, cystic and atretic follicles, and thickness of the theca and tunica albuginea layers, and a significant decrease in LH concentration, total antioxidant capacity, corpus luteum, antral follicles, and oocyte diameter. The mean concentration of FSH, on the other hand, did not change significantly. A trend of improvement was found in the treated groups with high doses of Calendula officinalis extract. CONCLUSION: In rats with PCOS and nonovulation, Calendula officinalis hydroalcoholic extract improved oxidative stress, restored folliculogenesis, and increased ovulation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to create Calendula officinalis-loaded nanofibre-based wound dressing materials to enhance the wound healing process. Calendula officinalis is an annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is antipyretic, antifungal, antioedema, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory (wound, oral and pharyngeal mucosa), antispasmodic, treats chronic ocular surface diseases, acts as a stimulant and a diaphoretic. It is also used in the prevention of acute dermatitis, and in the treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers, wounds and burns. METHOD: Electrospinning is an effective method for creating nano- and microfibres for biomedical applications. Calendula officinalis (CA) of various concentrations 5%, 10% and 15%)-loaded polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/sodium alginate (SAlg) nanofibre mats were successfully produced via blend electrospinning. Nanofibre mats were evaluated using: scanning electron microscopy (SEM); Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis; gel content; water vapour transmission rate (WVTR); swelling ratio; in vitro drug release studies; viability evaluation (cell culture and MTT assay); and an in vivo study using male Wistar rats. Rats were divided into three groups (n=3). In each group, rats were inflicted with five full-thickness wounds on the back and were treated with sterile gauze (control), PVA/SAlg nanofibre dressing (CA-free control), PVA/SAlg/CA5%, PVA/SAlg/CA10%, and PVA/SAlg/CA15% nanofibre dressing. RESULTS: Results showed that the obtained fibres were smooth with no surface aggregates, indicating complete incorporation of Calendula officinalis. The release of Calendula officinalis from loaded PVA/SAlg fibre mats in the first four hours was burst released and then was constant. PVA/SAlg and PVA/SAlg/CA nanofibres were not toxic to L929 mouse fibroblasts and supported cell attachment and proliferation. The results of the in vivo study showed that the PVA/SAlg/CA10% nanofibre dressing had a higher full-thickness wound healing closure rate compared with the control group on days seven, 14 and 21 after treatment. CONCLUSION: The results of this evaluation showed that PVA/SAlg/CA nanofibrous mats could be a candidate as an effective wound dressing; however, the percentage of CA in this compound needs further investigation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, face mask use has increased and became a part of our daily lives. While wearing, prolonged contact time and microenvironmental change profoundly lead to an acne flare-up, defined as \"maskne.\" AIMS: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of snail secretion filtrate, Calendula officinalis, and Glycyrrhiza glaba root extract combination serum (SCGS) in treating the maskne. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study. This study enrolled 66 participants with mild-to-moderate maskne. The SCGS and placebo were randomly assigned for participants to use twice daily for 12 weeks. Percentage change of acne lesion count, acne severity by Investigator Global Evaluation Acne (IGEA), sebum levels, corneometry levels, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema score by Visia®, and adverse events were evaluated 4-weekly at baseline to Week 12. At Week 12, all participants evaluated their satisfaction scores using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: In the mask-covered area, the percent reduction in inflammatory acne lesions from the treatment group was significantly greater than the placebo group at all time points (coefficient of percentage change of inflammatory lesions = -33.89 [95% CI -65.24, -2.53]; p = 0.03). Also, a subgroup analysis with participants using concurrent acne treatments revealed similar results (12 participants, coefficient = -50.30 [95% -88.65, -11.95]; p = 0.01). However, there were no significant differences in non-inflammatory lesions, all skin biophysics, and VAS between groups. Adverse events were mild and occurred in a few cases in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The SCGS could significantly improve inflammatory acne lesions and had a favorable tolerability profile, suggesting its role as an adjunctive treatment in maskne.",

Gelatin sponge and Calendula officinalis have been proven to have good hemostatic properties. The present In-vitro study analyzed the cytotoxicity and hemostatic properties of gelatin sponge and Calendula officinalis. The cytotoxic concentration/effective concentration of Calendula officinalis was determined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. The drug release was determined using a vertical Franz diffusion cell apparatus; solid-state characterization was assessed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The MTT assay showed 7% Calendula officinalis to be cytocompatible, and there was an increase in cell proliferation. When the 7% Calendula officinalis was loaded into the sponge, it was compatible, and the drug content was found to be 56.28 ± 13.84%. The time taken for the blood clot formation was measured using the Lee-White method. The gelatin sponge's time for clot formation was 161.70 ± 3.11 s, and the Calendula officinalis loaded gelatin sponge's time for clot formation was 158.75 ± 4.60 s. Hence, it could be concluded that when Calendula officinalis is incorporated into a gelatin sponge, it shows material compatibility and cytocompatibility, reduces the time for clot formation, and could be used as an alternative to other hemostatic agents."

The purpose of this research was to see how foliar polyamine spray affected growth and photosynthetic indices, as well as secondary metabolites and antioxidant activity of the aqueous and methanolic extracts of pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.). The experiment lasted for three months and was arranged in a randomized complete design with four replications. Three separate concentrations (0.5, 1 and 2.5 mM) of spermine (SPM), spermidine (SPD), and putrescine (PUT) were sprayed at four/five fully expanded leaf stage and some physiochemical attributes were evaluated. The treatments caused a significant increase in morphological and photosynthetic parameters and total oil. There were also significant variations in total phenolic and flavonoid content. Compared to other polyamines, 1 mM SPD foliar spraying showed the greatest effect. Furthermore, the highest antioxidant capacity (DPPH* scavenging assay, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and β-carotene bleaching activity) was observed in the 1 mM SPD treatment. The results showed that the calendula essential oils (EOs) were rich in sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons (55.92-95.94%), with c-Cadinene and d-Cadinene as the major sesquiterpenes in the EOs. Also, the flowers were rich sources of carotenoids (lutein, flavoxanthin and luteoxanthin) following polyamines application. Hence, it can be inferred that polyamines specially spermidine would find a wide range of application in pharmaceutical industries due to its impact on antioxidant properties of phenolic and flavonoid compounds.",

      "abstract": "The present study was carried out to determine the impact of FA application on growth performance, biochemical parameters, and antioxidant defense activity of Calendula officinalis. The results revealed that under a low dose of FA (40%) amended soil, the plant growth performance and metal tolerance index (MTI) were increased compared to control plants and further decreased with increased FA application (60%, 80%, and 100% FA). In addition, the incorporation of 40% FA in soil not only improved the physicochemical properties of soil but also increased the biochemical parameters in the Calendula plant, however, these parameters declined under high FA applications. It was also observed that antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD, CAT, POD, and APX) in leaves of Calendula officinalis increased at high FA application (100% FA) to combat heavy metal stress from FA. The overall study suggests that 40% FA amended soil is the best suitable dose for growing Calendula officinalis and can be considered as metal tolerant species for phytoremediation of 40% FA amended soil.Novelty statement: Fly ash (FA) management is a major problem nowadays. The present study was carried out for FA utilization and to determine the impact of FA amended soil on growth performance, antioxidant properties, and biochemical attributes of Calendula officinalis. This is a sustainable approach in which waste (FA) utilization was done simultaneously with the enhancement in response of the medicinally potent Calendula species. The novelty of this study also suggests that Calendula has phytoremediation potential for remediation of heavy metal polluted soil. Further, the relationship between the growth, biochemical parameters, and antioxidant defense mechanism of Calendula grown on FA amended soil was studied which has not been studied so far. It was found that Calendula is a hyperaccumulator that can adapt to heavy metal stress from FA due to its ability to mitigate oxidative damage. Statistical analysis (ANOVA, Duncan's multiple range test, and PCA) was done for the results obtained using SPSS (11.5) and Origin 8 Pro software.",

Based on these facts, we loaded Calendula officinalis extract (CO) in chitosan/polyethylene oxide scaffolds (CS/PEO) by electrospinning. Using SEM, morphology of electrospun scaffolds showed a narrow range of fiber diameter, around 143--252 nm, with uniform and bead-free appearance. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of CO extract in nanofibrous scaffolds. Of importance, incorporation of CO extract improved mechanical properties of CS/PEO nanofibers. A 1602 cP reduction in viscosity and a 0.892 ms/cm increase in the conductivity of the solution was observed after addition of the CO extract. CO extract showed strong antibacterial properties with 96% and 94% reduction in Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, respectively. In vitro studies with fibroblast cells confirmed enhanced proliferation, growth and attachment of the cells. The in vivo and histological analysis of rat wounds, revealed excellent wound healing ability of CS/PEO/CO dressings (87.5 % wound closure after 14 days) via improving collagen synthesis, re-epithelization and remodeling of the tissue. In sum, our findings show that CS/PEO/CO scaffolds can be used as a promising dressing for the treatment of skin wounds.",

Treatments included TiO2NPs applied as foliar spraying in three levels (50, 100, and 200 mgL-1), no foliar application as control, and different NaCl levels (0, 30, 60, and 90 mM) by adding NaCl to irrigation water. According to the results, the application of different concentrations of TiO2 had various effects on the studied parameters. The use of 100 mgL-1 TiO2NPs increased flavonoid content of the leaves (at 30 mM NaCl), cell membrane injury (with no salinity), CAT and SOD activities (at 90 mM NaCl), and PPO activity (at 60 mM NaCl). On the other hand, using 100 mgL-1 TiO2NPs under salinity stress decreased MDA and H2O2 contents. Moreover, using 200 mgL-1 TiO2NPs increased photosynthetic pigments content, total flavonoid content of flowers, total soluble sugar, carotenoid content of flowers, and RWC (at the treatment with no salinity), aboveground and underground biomasses (at 30 mM and 60 mM NaCl, respectively), phenolic content and antioxidant activity (at 30 mM NaCl), and APX activity (at 90 mM NaCl). In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicated that TiO2NPs could be a useful material to mitigate the harmful effects of salinity stress. Furthermore, the TiO2NPs spraying could have beneficial effects on osmotic adjustment, biochemical compound, non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant activities, and growth of marigold under NaCl stress conditions.",

The present investigation is focused to study the role of NO on neck bending associated with senescence and postharvest performance in isolated flowers of Calendula officinalis. The flower buds harvested at one day before anthesis stage were supplied with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as a source of NO at different concentrations viz., 50, 100, 150 and 200 µM. A distinct set of flowers held in distilled water designated the control. The investigation revealed that SNP delayed the senescence in flowers of C. officinalis significantly manifested by prolonged longevity. The maximum longevity of 12 days was recorded in flowers supplemented with 100 µM SNP. The flowers held in distilled water (control) displayed early senescence symptoms and lasted for 6 days only. Our research suggested that improved flower longevity by SNP was commensurate with delayed neck bending, inhibition of bacterial growth in the vase, increased solution uptake, high membrane stability, besides an up-regulated activities of antioxidant enzymes in the tissue samples. In addition, the treated flowers exhibited increased content of  sugar fractions, total phenols and soluble proteins in the petal tissues compared to control. Further, 100 µM SNP was observed as most effective treatment and increased the longevity of flowers by 6 days. The concentration above 150 µM provoked early senescence compared to control, whereas concentration lower than 100 µM was less efficacious in improving the postharvest life and longevity of cut Calendula flowers."

Our study examines the effect of oleanolic acid glucuronides from marigold (Calendula officinalis) on the possible modification of immunogenic proteins from infective Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri larvae (L3). Our findings indicate that the triterpenoid saponins alter the subcellular morphology of the larvae and prevent recognition of nematode-specific proteins by rabbit immune-IgG. TEM ultrastructure and HPLC analysis showed that microtubule and cytoskeleton fibres were fragmented by saponin treatment. MASCOT bioinformatic analysis revealed that in larvae exposed to saponins, the immune epitopes of their proteins altered. Several mitochondrial and cytoskeleton proteins involved in signalling and cellular processes were downregulated or degraded. As possible candidates, the following set of recognised proteins may play a key role in the immunogenicity of larvae: beta-tubulin isotype, alpha-tubulin, myosin, paramyosin isoform-1, actin, disorganized muscle protein-1, ATP-synthase, beta subunit, carboxyl transferase domain protein, glutamate dehydrogenase, enolase (phosphopyruvate hydratase), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 2, tropomyosin, arginine kinase or putative chaperone protein DnaK, and galactoside-binding lectin.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Calendula officinalis and Hypericum perforatum on antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and histopathologic indices of induced periodontitis in male rats. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this experimental animal study, forty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10) and then experimental periodontitis was induced by 3-0 nylon non-absorbable ligature. Each group was treated for 10 days as follows: 1) H. perforatum hydroalcoholic extract, 1000 mg/kg/daily, orally; 2) C. officinalis hydroalcoholic extract, 1000 mg/kg/daily, orally; 3) a mix of the two plants, 1000 mg/kg/ daily, orally, 4) normal saline solution. At the end of study, blood sample were obtained via cardiocentesis, the rats were euthanized, and their maxillae were removed. The samples were analyzed for histopathological scores and total antioxidant capacity and IL-1β were measured. RESULTS: Mixed hydroalchoholic extract of H. perforatum and C. officinalis decreased IL-1β (4.3020±0.63), and increased the antioxidant parameter in comparison to the control group (3.1192±0.43) (p< 0.001). There were significant histopathological differences between the treatment groups and the control group. CONCLUSION: Mixed hydroalchoholic extract of H. perforatum and C. officinalis might be considered as an adjunctive treatment for periodontitis."

Greywater was collected and treated using screening, sedimentation and solar disinfection methods. Finally, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of untreated and treated greywater on a selected vegetable, Capsicum frutescens and flowering plant, Calendula officinalis for 2 months. The findings depicted that untreated greywater contains higher macro-nutrients with excessive bacterial population compared with tap water (control), however, the treatment process reduced the concentration of most of the unwanted parameters from greywater samples to bring them into irrigation standards. Overall, treated greywater irrigation showed the species-specific impact on experimental plants with more stimulation in Capsicum frutescens species compared with tap water irrigation. Both treated and untreated greywater irrigation increased the growth parameters of Calendula officinalis in comparison with control. The impact was not significant for most of the parameters of Calendula officinalis while compared between greywater (treated and untreated) and control, and between treated and untreated greywater irrigation. Treated greywater irrigation significantly stimulated most of the parameters of Capsicum frutescens while untreated greywater increased only moisture content, and number of branches compared with control. Most interestingly, treated greywater irrigation had significant impact on Capsicum frutescens particularly for number of branches and leaves compared with untreated greywater irrigation. In fine, the greywater, after treatment was bacterially safe and had positive impact on plant growth. The findings of this study will help to conserve irrigation water and to protect and manage aquatic ecosystem from the adverse impact of wastewater.",

Published chromosome numbers differ between 2n = 4x = 28 or 32. We have estimated genome sizes in nine commercial cultivars and evaluated the ploidy level by karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using 5S and 45S rDNA loci. The detection of chromosome sets of two rather than four homologues would suggest that C. officinalis has an allotetraploid background. In addition, four signals for 45S but only two for 5S were found by using FISH. Artificial chromosome doubling is a common technique in plant breeding, as polyploidization results in several consequences for plant growth and development. Especially the suggested allotetraploid background in C. officinalis is interesting when examining the effect of chromosome doubling on the plant phenotype. Here we describe chromosome doubling of three allotetraploid cultivars of C. officinalis, 'Nova,' 'WUR 1553-7' and 'Orange Beauty'. Three antimitotic agents - colchicine, oryzalin and trifluralin - were used in different concentrations to find the combination of the best agent and the best dosage to obtain octaploids. For all three cultivars a few octaploids were obtained. A concentration of 200 and 400 ppm of colchicine was most efficient for chromosome doubling in 'Nova' and 'Orange Beauty,' respectively. For 'WUR 1553-7' the treatment with 20 ppm oryzalin was also effective. Cell numbers and first observations of the phenotype in the chromosome doubled plants show thicker leaves and bigger cells, as commonly observed after ploidy doubling. Due to the low number of chromosome doubled plants obtained more elaborate phenotyping will be performed on following generations cultivated under field conditions."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To meet the objective, soil and leaf samples were estimated for metal ions by atomic absorption spectrophotometer to determine the influence in antipsoriatic activity. Thereafter imiquimod-induced dermatitis lesions were created in grouped mice. Two plant extracts (aqueous) separately as well as in combinations and standard Retino-A (0.05%) were used. Psoriasis severity index (PSI) was evaluated according to the phenotypic (redness, erythema, and scales) and histological features (epidermal thickness). Further content of phytochemicals in terms of extract was correlated with the effect of psoriasis activity. RESULTS: We observed redness, erythema, and scales and the histological features and found a progressive reduction (P<0.05) in the severity of psoriatic lesions (redness, erythema, and scales) from days 7 to 21 and decreased epidermal thickness in animals treated with combined extracts at a dose of 200 mg/kg b.w. Furthermore, plant samples procured from the Nandi Hills, Bangalore, showed better uptake of metals with respect to Fe (2.05 mg/kg), Cu (0.78 mg/kg), and Zn (1.12 mg/kg), which showed a positive impact on procurement of maximum amount of extracts that further correlated with the activity, indicating a significant reduction in psoriatic lesions. CONCLUSION: The results revealed that the significant dose-dependent antipsoriasis activity of combined aqueous extracts of C. officinalis and P. decumanum as well as metal ions had an impact on the procurement of extracts and said activity."

Apart from the possible enhancement of triterpenoid production, the relationship between primary and secondary metabolism (represented respectively by sterols and pentacyclic triterpenes), modifications of the sterol compositional profile, and fluctuations in the total triterpenoid content were monitored in the performed experiments. The main phenomenon observed as a response to heavy metal treatment was the stimulation (up to 12-fold) of the secretion of saponins, accompanied by significant changes in sterol composition. Ultrasound stimulated the secretion of saponins (up to 11-fold); however, it exerted diverse influences on the triterpenoid content in hairy root tissue (stimulating or decreasing) depending on the duration of the exposure to the elicitor. UV-C radiation caused a slight increase in the content of both sterols and saponins in hairy root tissue, and stimulated saponin secretion up to 8.5-fold. The expected symptoms of the competition between the biosynthetic pathways of sterols and pentacyclic triterpenoids were less evident in reactions to abiotic stressors than those reported previously for biotic elicitors.",

Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Scopus (up to April 2018) with 14 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, comprising 7 animal experiments and 7 clinical trials. Findings from the review on acute wound healing showed faster resolution of the inflammation phase with increased production of granulation tissue in the test groups treated with extract. These findings were consistent in five animal studies and one randomized clinical trial. Chronic wound healing studies were varied. Two clinical control studies on venous ulcers demonstrated decreased ulcer surface area compared to controls. Another randomized clinical trial demonstrated no improvement for the calendula group in diabetic leg ulcer healing. Burn healing similarly showed mixed results. Two animal studies demonstrated a prophylactic effect for the administration of calendula extract prior to burn injury. A randomized clinical trial of patients suffering from partial to full thickness burns demonstrated no benefit for topical application of calendula extract compared to controls. Two randomized clinical trials assessed the potential for extract to prevent acute post radiation dermatitis, with one study showing improvements compared to trolamine, while the other found no improvement compared to aqua gel cream. Animal studies provide moderate evidence for improved recovery from the inflammation phase and increased production of granulation tissue in calendula extract treatment groups. This review identified some evidence for the beneficial effects of C. officinalis extract for wound healing, consistent with its role in traditional medicine. There is a need for larger, well-designed randomized control trials to assess the effect of calendula on wound healing including complications.",

The aim of this study is to determine the effects of ethanolic and methanolic extracts of Calendula officinalis on the expression of TGFβ1 and bFGF in the mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs). METHODS: Calendula officinalis extract was purchased and different substances defined with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. MEFs were prepared and after incubating for 15 min, cell viability analyzed. TGF β 1 and bFGF gene expression was evaluated by real-time PCR. TGFβ1 and bFGF protein expression analyzed by ELISA. The statistical analysis of data was done by using SPSS software. Differences were considered significant at (P < 0.05). RESULTS: The results of the MTT test showed that the concentrations of 5 μg/ml and10 μg/ml were more suitable for cell proliferation. There was an increase in TGF β 1 gene expression in the MEFs. Expression of TGF β 1 gene remains the same after 24 h. Gene expression of bFGF showed a similar pattern with TGF β 1 expression for both solvents. Analysis of TGFβ1 protein expression showed an increase in TGFβ1 gene expression in the MEFs. Protein expression of bFGF in the MEFs increased at different concentrations at 12 and 24 h after treatment (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION: Calendula officinalis stimulates proliferation of MEFs. Calendula via increased expression of growth factors (TGFβ1 and bFGF) at the first 12 h and a decrease of these factors at 24 h after treatment may ameliorate function of the MEFs in the during wound healing."

The aim of this work was to investigate the chemical characterization and antimelanogenic and antimigration activities of the ethyl acetate fraction of C. officinalis flowers (EFC), as well as elucidate the potential mechanism. The obtained results showed that EFC markedly decreased α-MSH-induced melanin production and the cell migration ability of melanoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, EFC significantly inhibited the activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) via suppressing the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that C. officinalis flowers can be used as a natural source of antimelanogenisis and antimigration regent to treatment or prevent skin diseases.",

Consequently, new conventional and unconventional drugs and bioactive compounds from plants are constantly developed, characterized, and used for in vitro and in vivo models. This review focuses on the antitumor properties of Calendula officinalis, its biological and molecular effects in tumor cells and animal models, as well as its role in cancer palliative care. A systematic review of studies describing the cytotoxic role of C officinalis and its therapeutic role on cancer cells were carried out using the PubMed database. Albeit C officinalis extracts have cytotoxic activity toward different cancer cell lines, a high grade of variation between studies was observed, depending on plant organ subjected to extraction, extraction method, and the cancer cell lines used for each study. Nevertheless, its cytotoxic activity is related to a few bioactive compounds, presenting multiple roles in both activation of proapoptotic proteins and decreasing the expression of the proteins that inhibit cell death. Moreover, due to its anti-genotoxic/protective as well as antitumor and antimetastatic effects proven in animal models, C officinalis could have important future implications in developing novel cancer treatment strategies, while until now it has been used especially for diminishing the side effects of radiotherapy.",

The HPLC profile of saponin fraction obtained from C. officinalis hairy roots treated with plant stress hormone, jasmonic acid, showed the 10-times increase of the content of one particular compound, determined by NMR and MALDI TOF as a new bisdesmoside saponin, 3-O-β-d-glucuronopyranosyl-28-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-oleanolic acid. Such a diglycoside does not occur in native C. officinalis plant. It is a glucuronide, whereas in the native plant glucuronides are mainly accumulated in flowers, while glucosides are the most abundant saponins in roots.

In this study, 80 women of reproductive age with BV were randomly assigned to the C. officinalis (n = 40) or metronidazole (n = 40). Diagnosis of BV was confirmed when at least 3 of the 4 Amsel criteria were met (pH >4.5, whitish grey or thin homogeneous discharge, release of a fishy odor on adding 10% KOH, and detection of clue cells on microscopic examination). For each group, either a methanol extract of C. officinalis or metronidazole vaginal cream (5 g) was used for 1 week intravaginally, and all signs and symptoms were assessed 1 week after treatment completion. Before the intervention, the two groups did not differ significantly with regard to vaginal burning, odor, dysuria, and dyspareunia, but itching was significantly more common in the C. officinalis group than in the metronidazole group (22.5% vs. 2.5%, P = 0.01). One week after the intervention, all women in both groups were free of symptoms, including vaginal itching and burning sensation, odor, dysuria, and dyspareunia. None of the women in either group suffered any side effects from C. officinalis or metronidazole. C. officinalis was effective for the treatment of BV in women of reproductive age, without any side effects. This herb could be recommended for women of reproductive age who uncomfortable with the potential side effects of synthetic drugs."

The aim of this study was to use Calendula officinalis during and after tooth extraction to determine its ability to preserve bone after this procedure. METHODS: We established two groups matched by age, gender and position of the third molar. We used with patients on the experimental group Calendula officinalis diluted 10% as an irrigant during surgical extraction of third molars. We performed the conventional way with the control group irrigating with saline solution. Subsequently, both groups continued to make mouthwash for a week with the irrigating agent. Every week for a month, each patient underwent periapical radiography, out of which we took measurements of alveolar ridges and depth of alveolar bone, which were compared. CONCLUSIONS: There is statistically significant evidence to state that Calendula officinalis favorably affects bone preservation after extraction.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antiresorptive effects of Calendula officinalis (CLO) on alveolar bone loss (ABL) in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to ABL by ligature with nylon thread around the second upper left molar. The contralateral hemimaxillae were used as control. Rats received saline solution (SAL) or CLO (10, 30, or 90 mg/kg) 30 min before ligature and daily until the 11th day. The maxillae were removed and prepared for macroscopic, radiographic, micro-tomographic, histopathologic, histometric analysis, and immunohistochemical localization of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). The gingival tissues were used to quantify the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) concentrations by ELISA. Blood samples were collected for leukogram and to evaluate the bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) activity and serum levels of aspartate and alanine transaminases (AST/ALT). RESULTS: The bone loss induced by 11 days of ligature induced bone loss, reduced levels of BALP, leukocyte infiltration, increased MPO activity, gingival concentrations of TNF-α and IL-1β, and RANKL while reduced OPG immunoexpressions in the periodontal tissue and leukocytosis. Of the CLO, 90 mg/kg reduced bone loss, neutrophilia, the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, and RANKL expression, while it increased OPG immunopositive cells and BALP serum levels, when compared to SAL. CLO did not affect either kidney or liver function, indicated by serum AST/ALT levels. CONCLUSION: The present data suggests that CLO reduced inflammatory bone resorption in experimental periodontitis, which may be mediated by its anti-inflammatory properties and its effects on bone metabolism. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: CLO can be a potential therapeutical adjuvant in the treatment of periodontitis.",

Marigold (Calendula officinalis) seedlings were grown in a greenhouse and fumigated with fluoranthene (FLU), phenanthrene (PHE), Mann, and S.Acid individually and in various combinations for 40 days. Various physiological and biochemical parameters among others were analyzed using standard methods. The results revealed that fumigation of FLU induced oxidative stress to the plants via ROS generation leading to negative effects on photosynthesis at near saturating irradiance (Amax), stomatal conductance (Gs), internal carbon dioxide concentration (Ci), leaf water relations and chlorophyll pigments. Significant per cent inhibition of Amax (54%), Gs (86%) and Ci (32%), as well as per cent reductions in chlorophyll a (Chl.a) (33%), Chl.b (34%), and total chlorophyll (Tot. Chl) (48%) contents were recorded in FLU fumigated treatment in comparison to control. Combination of Mann with FLU scavenged the generated ROS and substantially lowered the oxidative stress on the plants hence all the measured parameters were not significantly different from control. PHE fumigation had varied effects on marigold plants and was not as deleterious as FLU. Combined fumigation of S.Acid with both the PAHs had significant negative effect on leaf water relations, and positive effect on fresh and turgid weight of the plants but had no effect on the other measured parameters. The lowest proline contents and highest catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities in FLU fumigated plants further confirmed that oxidative stress was imposed via the generation of ROS. From the results, it is evident that Mann could be an efficient scavenger of ROS-generated by FLU in the marigold plants. We recommend Mann to be widely used for the protection of higher plants from FLU-generated stress in the urban areas.",

RESULTS: The results revealed a statistically significant difference in both Group I and Group II when the pre- and post-treatment results were compared in the same group. The mean difference in the reduction in size before and after treatment for Group I was 2.0% ±1.0 cm while for the Group II, it was 1.57% ±0.87 cm. The intergroup comparison for the evaluation of reduction in the size of the lesion did not reveal statistically significant results. CONCLUSION: C. officinalis extract gel can be effectively used as an alternative to conventional treatment modality."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the Calendula officinalis extract, Plenusdermax, in the treatment of VLUs. METHOD: Patients treated with Calendula officinalis extract (n=38) and control patients (n=19) were evaluated every two weeks for 30 weeks or until their ulcers healed. Assessments included determination of the wound area by planimetry, infection control, and evaluation of the clinical aspects of the wounds. The percentage of healing velocity per week (%HVw), taking the initial area at baseline into account, was also determined. RESULTS: The proportion of the treatment patients achieving complete epithelialisation was 72 % and 32 % in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The average healing time was approximately 12 weeks in the treatment group and 25 % in control patients. Patients with ulcers treated with Calendula officinalis extract had a significant 4-fold increase in percentage healing velocity per week, 7.4 %, compared with 1.7 % in the control group. No adverse events were observed during the Calendula officinalis extract treatment. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that Calendula officinalis extract is an effective treatment for VLUs.

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Calendula officinalis (pot marigold) flower extracts have a long-lasting tradition in ethnopharmacology. Currently, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved its lipophilic and aqueous alcoholic extracts as traditional medicinal products for the treatment of minor inflammation of the skin and as an aid in the healing of minor wounds. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to analyse the molecular mechanism of the wound healing effects of Calendula extracts, which may reflect the phytomedicines currently used in the market. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of three different extracts from Calendula flowers (n-hexanic, ethanolic, aqueous) on the inflammatory phase of wound healing was studied in human immortalized keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay on NF-κB-DNA binding, qRT-PCR and ELISA experiments were performed. The effect of Calendula extracts on the new tissue formation phase of wound healing was evaluated by studying the migratory properties of these extracts, triterpene mixtures and single compounds in human immortalized keratinocytes using the scratch assay. Finally, the effect of the extracts on the formation of granulation tissue in wound healing was studied using bacterial collagenase isolated from Clostridium histolyticum and the determination of soluble collagen in the supernatant of human dermal fibroblasts. RESULTS: The n-hexanic and the ethanolic extracts from Calendula flowers influence the inflammatory phase by activating the transcription factor NF-κB and by increasing the amount of the chemokine IL-8, both at the transcriptional and protein level, in human immortalized keratinocytes. The migration of the keratinocytes during the new tissue formation phase was only marginally influenced in the scratch assay. However, it can be assumed that the granulation tissue was affected, as the ethanolic extract inhibited the activity of collagenase in vitro and enhanced the amount of collagen in the supernatant of human dermal fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to a better understanding of the wound healing properties of the traditional medicinal plant Calendula officinalis. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate which of its known constituents are responsible for these effects. Triterpenes seem to play only a marginal role, but carotene and xanthophyll derivatives should garner more attention in future studies.",

Clinical and laboratory assessments were conducted at 10-15 and 30-35 days after intervention and the female sexual function index was assessed at 30-35 days. Six women were lost to follow-up. The frequency of testing negative for Candidiasis in the Calendula group was significantly lower at the first (49% vs. 74%; odds ratio (OR) 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.67) but higher at the second (77% vs. 34%; OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.5-6.2) follow-up compared to the clotrimazole group. The frequency of most signs and symptoms were almost equal in the two groups at the first follow-up, but were significantly lower in the Calendula group at the second follow-up.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of low-level laser therapy isolated and associated with Calendula officinalis oil in treating diabetic foot ulcers. METHOD: An experimental, randomized, controlled, prospective, interventional clinical case study using a quantitative approach. The sample consisted of 32 diabetic patients of both genders. Participants were randomly divided into four groups. Doppler Ultrasound evaluation of the Ankle-Brachial Index, brief pain inventory and analog pain scale were performed at baseline and after 30 days. RESULTS: Reduced pain was observed in the Low-level laser therapy and Low-level laser therapy associated with Essential Fatty Acids groups (p<0.01). Regarding the Ankle-Brachial Index and Doppler Ultrasound, all groups remained stable. By analyzing lesion area reduction, Low-level laser therapy associated with Essential fatty acids group showed a significance of p=0.0032, and the Low-level laser therapy group showed p=0.0428. CONCLUSION: Low-level laser therapy, performed alone or associated with the Calendula officinalis oil was effective in relieving pain and accelerating the tissue repair process of diabetic foot.

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Calendula officinalis L. (Asteraceae) has been traditionally used in treating inflammation of internal organs, gastrointestinal tract ulcers and wound healing. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigates the effect of ethanol extract (95%) of Calendula officinalis flowers in l-arginine induced acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into four groups: normal control, l-arginine control, Calendula officinalis extract (COE) treated and melatonin treated (positive control), which were further divided into subgroups (24 h, day 3 and 14) according to time points. Two injections of l-arginine 2 g/kg i.p. at 1 h intervals were administered in l-arginine control, COE and melatonin-treated groups to produce acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Biochemical parameters [serum amylase, lipase, pancreatic amylase, nucleic acid content, total proteins, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), collagen content, lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione and nitrite/nitrate] and histopathological studies were carried out. RESULTS: COE treatment (400 mg/kg p.o.) was found to be beneficial. This was evidenced by significantly lowered histopathological scores (2 at day 14). Nucleic acid content (DNA 21.1 and RNA 5.44 mg/g pancreas), total proteins (0.66 mg/mL pancreas) and pancreatic amylase (1031.3 100 SU/g pancreas) were significantly improved. Marked reduction in pancreatic oxidative and nitrosative stress; collagen (122 μmoles/100 mg pancreas) and TGF-β1 (118.56 pg/mL) levels were noted. Results obtained were comparable to those of positive control. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of COE may be attributed to its antioxidant, antinitrosative and antifibrotic actions. Hence, the study concludes that COE promotes spontaneous repair and regeneration of the pancreas.",

      "abstract": "Chemical mutagenesis is an efficient tool used in mutation-breeding programs to improve the vital characters of the floricultural crops. This study aimed to estimate the effects of different concentrations of two chemical mutagens; sodium azide (SA) and diethyl sulfate (DES). The vegetative growth and flowering characteristics in two generations (M1 and M2) of calendula plants were investigated. Seeds were treated with five different concentrations of SA and DES (at the same rates) of 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 ppm, in addition to a control treatment of 0 ppm. Results showed that lower concentrations of SA mutagen had significant effects on seed germination percentage, plant height, leaf area, plant fresh weight, flowering date, inflorescence diameter, and gas-exchange measurements in plants of both generations. Calendula plants tended to flower earlier under low mutagen concentrations (1000 ppm), whereas higher concentrations delayed flowering significantly. Positive results on seed germination, plant height, number of branches, plant fresh weight, and leaf area were observed in the M2-generation at lower concentrations of SA (1000 ppm), as well as at 4000 ppm DES on number of leaves and inflorescences. The highest total soluble protein was detected at the concentrations of 1000 ppm SA and 2000 ppm DES. DES showed higher average of acid phosphatase activity than SA. Results indicated that lower concentrations of SA and DES mutagens had positive effects on seed germination percentage, plant height, leaf area, plant fresh weight, flowering date, inflorescence diameter, and gas-exchange measurements. Thus, lower mutagen concentrations could be recommended for better floral and physio-chemical performance.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) have a significant impact on patient quality of life. A prospective, descriptive pilot study was conducted between May 2012 and December 2013 through the dermatology outpatient unit in a Brazilian hospital to evaluate the clinical benefits of using Calendula officinalis hydroglycolic extract in the treatment of DFUs. Patients diagnosed with a stable neuropathic ulcer of >3 months' duration; ranging in size from 0.5-40 cm(2); without osteomyelitis, gangrene, bone exposure, cancer, or deep tissue infection; ages 18-90 years; with adequate glycemic control and no history of an allergy to C. officinalis were enrolled. Patients provided demographic and diabetes-related information and were evaluated biweekly for 30 weeks or until healing (ie, full epithelialization with no wound drainage). DFUs were measured and clinically examined for microbiological flora and presence of odor, tissue type (eg, granulation, fibrin sloth, necrosis), exudate, and retraction rate using planimetry images. Patients' blood tests and neuropathic pain assessment (the latter by clinician-directed questionnaire) were performed at baseline and the end of treatment; pain also was assessed during dressing changes using a 10-point rating scale. Patients' ulcers were treated twice daily with C. officinalis hydroglycolic extract spray solution and covered with saline-moistened, sterile, nonadherent gauze and bandages followed by foot offloading with adequate protective footwear. Patients received their first treatment in the clinic then performed care at home. From a potential population of 109 patients, 25 did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the remaining 84 participants enrolled, 43 withdrew before study completion; cited reasons included lost to follow-up (16), medical judgment (2), failure to attend >3 scheduled visits (17), protocol violation (5), and death (3). Forty-one (41) - 17 women, average age 62 years (range 44-82 years), average glycemic level 153 mg/dL (range 82-395 mg/dL), most (34) with Wagner type 1 ulcers--completed the study. The proportions of patients who achieved complete wound closure after 11, 20, and 30 weeks of treatment was 54%, 68%, and 78%, respectively; mean healing time was 15.5 ± 6.7 weeks. When individual weekly healing rates (the percentage reduction in wound area per week) were corrected for variability in initial DFU area, the values were nearly 6-fold higher for complete wound closure (7.8% ± 3.6%) than for incomplete wound closure (1.4% ± 0.7%) (Student t-test; P = 0.001). After 30 weeks of treatment, the number of colonized wounds decreased from 29 at baseline to 5, and the number of odorous wounds decreased from 19 to 1. Ulcer bed planimetry data showed a significant reduction in the amount of exudate, fibrin slough, and necrotic tissue after the treatment with C. officinalis hydroglycolic extract (χ(2) test; P = 0.001). No adverse events were observed during treatment. The study findings suggest C. officinalis extract is safe and has a beneficial effect on DFU healing. Randomized, controlled studies using C. officinalis hydroglycolic extract are warranted to confirm its safety and establish its clinical efficacy and effectiveness for the topical treatment of DFUs.",

The efficacy of herbal preparations in subjects with gingivitis has been reported in some previous studies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of a polyherbal mouthwash containing hydroalcoholic extracts of Zingiber officinale, Rosmarinus officinalis and Calendula officinalis (5% v/w) compared with chlorhexidine and placebo mouthwashes in subjects with gingivitis. METHODS: Sixty patients participated in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial and were randomly assigned to the polyherbal mouthwash (n = 20), chlorhexidine mouthwash (n = 20) or placebo mouthwash (n = 20). Participants were instructed to use the mouthwash twice a day (after breakfast and dinner) for 30 s for a period of two weeks. Gingival and plaque indices were assessed using MGI, GBI and MQH scales at baseline, day 7 and day 14 of the trial. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in all assessed efficacy measures i.e. MGI, GBI and MQH scores from baseline to the end of trial in both polyherbal and chlorhexidine mouthwash groups; however, the scores remained statistically unchanged in the placebo group. MGI, BGI and MQH scores in the treatment groups were significantly lower compared with those of the control group at both day 7 and day 14 of the trial. However, there was no significant difference between the polyherbal and chlorhexidine groups, neither at day 7 nor day 14 of the trial. Polyherbal mouthwash was safe and there was neither report of adverse reactions, nor any drop-out during the course of study. CONCLUSION: Polyherbal mouthwash containing hydroalcoholic extracts of Z. officinale, R. officinalis and C. officinalis (5%) was effective in the treatment of gingivitis and its efficacy was comparable to that of chlorhexidine mouthwash.",

Several therapeutic strategies such as consumption of medicinal plants have been used for its treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate healing effects of Calendula officinalis hydroalcoholic extract in experimentally induced UC in rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-six rats, weighing 200 ± 20 g, were randomly divided into eight equal groups. UC induced by 3% acetic acid and oral doses of C. officinalis extract, 1500 and 3000 mg/kg, and enema (gel 10% and 20%) were given. Two groups as positive controls were given asacol (enema) and oral mesalamine. Negative control groups were given normal saline and base gel. On days 3 and 7, intestinal histopathology and weight changes, plus oxidative stress indices including malondialdehyde (MDA) level and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were assayed. RESULTS: A significant increase in the body weight of rats was seen in the group given C. officinalis extract 3000 mg/kg orally, oral mesalamine, and 20% intracolonic gel form of marigold extract compared with negative control and base gel groups during the experimental period. Acute inflammation and granular atrophy after UC induction were resolved completely completely by both 20% intracolonic gel and 3000 mg/kg orally. An increase in MPO activity and a decrease in MDA level in response to oral and intracolonic gel form of C. officinalis were observed 3 and and 7 days after treatment (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that oral and enema forms of hydroalcoholic extract of C. officinalis can be offered as are potential therapeutic agents for UC induced in rats.",

AIMS: To examine the effect of hydroalcoholic extract of CO on passive avoidance learning (PAL) and memory in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic male rats. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A total of 32 adult male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to four groups: Control, diabetic, control + extract of CO and diabetic control + extract of CO groups with free access to regular rat diet. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Diabetes in diabetic rats was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg STZ. After confirmation of diabetes, oral administration of 300 mg/kg CO extract to extract-treated groups have been done. PAL was tested 8 weeks after onset of treatment, and blood glucose and body weight were measured in all groups at the beginning and end of the experiment. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The statistical analysis of data was performed by ANOVA followed by least significant difference post-hoc analysis. RESULTS: Diabetes decreased learning and memory. Effect of CO extract in retention test (after 24 and 48 h) has been shown a significant decrease in step-through latency and increase in time spent in the dark compartment part. Also the extract partially improved hyperglycemia and reduced body weight. CONCLUSION: Taken together, CO extract can improve PAL and memory impairments in STZ-diabetic rats. This improvement may be due to its antioxidant, anticholinergic activities or its power to reduce hyperglycemia."

Microparticles made of gelatin-collagen were produced by a water-in-oil emulsion/cross-linking method. Thereafter, these microparticles were mixed with collagen suspensions at three increasing concentrations and the resulting mixtures lyophilized to make microparticle-loaded porous collagen scaffolds. Resistance to enzymatic degradation, ability to associate with the C. officinalis extract, and the extract release profile of the three gelatin-collagen microparticle-scaffold prototypes were assessed in vitro and compared to collagen scaffolds without microparticles used as control. Data indicated that the incorporation of gelatin-collagen microparticles increased the resistance of the scaffolds to in vitro enzymatic degradation, as well as their association with the C. officinalis flower extract. In addition, a sharp decrease in cytotoxicity, as well as more prolonged release of the extract, was attained. Overall results support the potential of these systems to develop innovative dermal substitutes with improved features. Furthermore, the gelatin-collagen mixture represents a low-cost and scalable alternative with high clinical transferability, especially appealing in developing countries.",

      "abstract": "Calendula officinalis, a member of the Asteraceae family, is a flowering plant and has been used for its antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiinflammatory, anticancer and wound healing activity. The mode of action of C. officinalis tincture on wound healing is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of C. officinalis tincture (CDOT) on cell viability and wound closure. C. officinalis tincture stimulated both proliferation and migration of fibroblasts in a statistically significant manner in a PI3K-dependent pathway. The increase in phosphorylation of FAK (Tyr 397) and Akt (Ser 473) was detected after treatment of CDOT. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway by wortmannin and LY294002 decreased both cell proliferation and cell migration. HPLC-ESI MS revealed the presence of flavonol glycosides as the major compounds of CDOT. Altogether, our results showed that CDOT potentiated wound healing by stimulating proliferation and migration of fibroblast in a PI3K-dependent pathway, and the identified compounds are likely to be responsible for wound healing activity.",

Then, it is supposed that it may be effective in diaper rash; however, no published studies were found in this regard. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the effects of Shampoo-clay (S.C) and Calendula officinalis (C.O) to improve infantile diaper rash. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, double blind, parallel controlled, non-inferiority trial was conducted on 60 outpatient infants referred to health care centers or pediatric clinics in Khomein city and diagnosed with diaper rash. Patients were randomly assigned into two treatment groups including S.C group (n = 30) and C.O group (n = 30) by using one to one allocation ratio. The rate of complete recovery in three days was the primary outcome. Data was collected using a checklist and analyzed using t-test, Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests and risk ratio. RESULTS: Totally, 93.3% of lesions in the S.C group healed in the first 6 hours, while this rate was 40% in C.O group (P < 0.001). The healing ratio for improvement in the first 6 hours was 7 times more in the S.C group. In addition, 90% of infants in the SC group and 36.7% in the C.O group were improved completely in the first 3 days (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: S.C was effective to heal diaper rash, and also had faster effects compared to C.O."

Oxidative stress is well documented in MSG induced neurotoxicity. The compounds having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties reportedly possess beneficial effects against various neurotoxic insults. Calendula officinalis Linn. flower extract (COE) is known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Hence, this present study has been designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of COE on MSG-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Adult Wistar rats were administered systemically for 7 days with MSG and after one h of MSG injection, rats were treated with COE (100 and 200 mg/kg) orally. At the end the treatment period, animals were assessed for locomotor activity and were sacrificed; brains were isolated for estimation of LPO, GSH, CAT, TT, GST, Nitrite and histopathological studies. MSG caused a significant alteration in animal behavior, oxidative defense (raised levels of LPO, nitrite concentration, depletion of antioxidant levels) and hippocampal neuronal histology. Treatment with COE significantly attenuated behavioral alterations, oxidative stress, and hippocampal damage in MSG-treated animals. Hence, this study demonstrates that COE protects against MSG-induced neurotoxicity in rats. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of COE may be responsible for its observed neuroprotective action."

The compounds, having antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and estrogenic effects, have been suggested for neuroprotection in different experimental models. Calendula officinalis Linn. flower extract (COE) is known for its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, estrogenic and neuroprotective activities. Hence, the present study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of COE on 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity in rats by observing behavioral changes, OS and striatal damage in rat brain. Adult female Wistar rats were pretreated with vehicle or COE (100 and 200 mg/kg) for 7 days, followed by cotreatment with 3-NP (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for the next 7 days. At the end of the treatment schedule, rats were evaluated for alterations in sensory motor functions and short-term memory. Animals were sacrificed and brain homogenates were used for the estimation of lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione, total thiols, glutathione S-transferase, catalase and nitrite. A set of brain slices was used for the evaluation of neuronal damage in the striatal region of the brain. 3-NP caused significant alterations in animal behavior, oxidative defense system evidenced by raised levels of LPO and nitrite concentration, and depletion of antioxidant levels. It also produced a loss of neuronal cells in the striatal region. Treatment with COE significantly attenuated behavioral alterations, oxidative damage and striatal neuronal loss in 3-NP-treated animals. The present study shows that COE is protective against 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity in rats. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and estrogenic properties of COE may be responsible for its neuroprotective action.",

Forty patients with neck and head cancers under radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy protocols were randomly assigned to receive either 2% calendula extract mouthwash or placebo (20 patients in each group). Patients were treated with telecobalt radiotherapy at conventional fractionation (200 cGy/fraction, five fractions weekly, 30-35 fractions within 4-7 weeks). The oropharyngeal mucositis was evaluated by two clinical investigators (a radiation oncologist and a dentist), using the oral mucositis assessment scale (OMAS). Trying to find out the possible mechanism of action of the treatment, total antioxidant, polyphenol and flavonoid contents, and quercetin concentration of the mouth wash were measured. Calendula mouthwash significantly decreased the intensity of OM compared to placebo at week 2 (score: 5.5 vs. 6.8, p = 0.019), week 3 (score: 8.25 vs. 10.95, p < 0.0001) and week 6 (score: 11.4 vs. 13.35, p = 0.031). Total antioxidant, polyphenol and flavonoid contents and quercetin concentration of the 2% extract were 2353.4 ± 56.5 μM, 313.40 ± 6.52 mg/g, 76.66 ± 23.24 mg/g, and 19.41 ± 4.34 mg/l, respectively. Calendula extract gel could be effective on decreasing the intensity of radiotherapy- induced OM during the treatment and antioxidant capacity may be partly responsible for the effect."

Six groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 6 weeks included the control; the group fed AFs-contaminated diet (2.5 mg/kg diet); the groups treated orally with Calendula extract at low (CA1) and high (CA2) doses (500 and 1000 mg/kg b.w); the groups treated orally with CA1 and CA2 one week before and during AFs treatment for other five weeks. The results showed that the ethanol extract contained higher phenolic compounds and posses higher 1,1-diphenyl 1-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity than the aqueous extract. Animals fed AFs-contaminated diet showed significant disturbances in serum biochemical parameters, inflammatory cytokines, and the histological and histochemical pictures of the liver accompanied by a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in liver. Calendula extract succeeded to improve the biochemical parameters, inflammatory cytokines, decreased the oxidative stress, and improved the histological pictures in the liver of rats fed AFs-contaminated diet in a dose-dependent manner. It could be concluded that Calendula extract has potential hepatoprotective effects against AFs due to its antioxidant properties and radical scavenging activity."

The objective of the present randomized and double-blind trial was to compare the therapeutic efficacies of aloe vera cream and Calendula officinalis ointment on the frequency and severity of DD in children. METHODS: Sixty-six infants with DD (aged < 3 years) were randomized to receive either aloe cream (n = 32) or Calendula ointment (n = 34). Infants were treated with these drugs 3 times a day for 10 days. The severity of dermatitis was graded at baseline as well as at the end of trial using a 5-point scale. The adverse effects of study medications were assessed during the trial. RESULTS: Although improvement in the severity of DD was observed in both treatment groups (P < 0.001), patients receiving Calendula ointment had significantly fewer rash sites compared to aloe group (P = 0.001). No adverse effect was reported from either of the medications. DISCUSSION: The evidence from this study suggests that topical aloe and in particular Calendula could serve as safe and effective treatment for the treatment of diaper dermatitis in infants.",

The main uses are as remedies for burns (including sunburns), bruises and cutaneous and internal inflammatory diseases of several origins. The recommended doses are a function both of the type and severity of the condition to be treated and the individual condition of each patient. Therefore, the present study investigated the potential use of Calendula officinalis extract to prevent UV irradiation-induced oxidative stress in skin. METHODS: Firstly, the physico-chemical composition of marigold extract (ME) (hydroalcoholic extract) was assessed and the in vitro antioxidant efficacy was determined using different methodologies. Secondly, the cytotoxicity was evaluated in L929 and HepG2 cells with the MTT assay. Finally, the in vivo protective effect of ME against UVB-induced oxidative stress in the skin of hairless mice was evaluated by determining reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and monitoring the secretion/activity of metalloproteinases. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The polyphenol, flavonoid, rutin and narcissin contents found in ME were 28.6 mg/g, 18.8 mg/g, 1.6 mg/g and 12.2mg/g, respectively and evaluation of the in vitro antioxidant activity demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of ME against different radicals. Cytoxicity experiments demonstrated that ME was not cytotoxic for L929 and HepG2 cells at concentrations less than or equal to of 15 mg/mL. However, concentrations greater than or equal to 30 mg/mL, toxic effects were observed. Finally, oral treatment of hairless mice with 150 and 300 mg/kg of ME maintained GSH levels close to non-irradiated control mice. In addition, this extract affects the activity/secretion of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and -9) stimulated by exposure to UVB irradiation. However, additional studies are required to have a complete understanding of the protective effects of ME for skin.",

The activities of serum marker enzymes of liver injury like glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) which were increased by CCl4 injection was found to be significantly reduced by the pretreatment of the flower extract at 100 and 250 mg/kg body weight. The lipid peroxidation in liver, the marker of membrane damage and the total bilirubin content in serum were also found to be at significantly low level in the extract pretreated group, indicating its protective role. The kidney function markers like urea and creatinine were significantly increased in cisplatin treated animals. However, their levels were found to be lowered in the extract pretreated groups (100 and 250 mg/kg body weight). Moreover, cisplatin induced myelosuppression was ameliorated by the extract pretreatment. Treatment with the extract produced enhancement of antioxidant enzymes--superoxide dismutase and catalase and glutathione. Results suggest a protective role of the flower extract of C. officinalis against CCl4 induced acute hepatotoxicity and cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity. Extract has been found to contain several carotenoids of which lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene predominates. Possible mechanism of action of the flower extract may be due to its antioxidant activity and reduction of oxygen radicals.",

In chronic anti-inflammatory model using formalin, administration of 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight Calendula extract produced an inhibition of 32.9 and 62.3% respectively compared to controls. TNF-alpha production by macrophage culture treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found to be significantly inhibited by Calendula extract. Moreover, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma and acute phase protein, C- reactive protein (CRP) in mice produced by LPS injection were inhibited significantly by the extract. LPS induced cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) levels in mice spleen were also found to be inhibited by extract treatment. The results showed that potent anti-inflammatory response of C. officinalis extract may be mediated by the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and Cox-2 and subsequent prostaglandin synthesis.",

From day 53 to 60 of treatment, rats were mated with untreated and fertile female rats. Reproductive parameters including testicular morphology, reproductive organ weights, fertility index and offspring viability were evaluated. In another protocol, groups of pregnant rats were treated orally with the same doses of HAE from days 1 to 6 (preimplantation period), 7 to 14 (organogenic period) or 15 to 19 (fetal period) of pregnancy. On day 20 of pregnancy, rats were killed for evaluation of maternal and fetal parameters. The results showed that the treatment with HAE did not affect male reproductive parameters. Besides, it was non-toxic in the preimplantation and organogenic periods of pregnancy. However, the HAE induced a decrease of the maternal weight gain when administered during the fetal period. In conclusion, the HAE did not affect male fertility nor had toxic effects in early and middle periods of pregnancy. However, the HAE caused maternal toxicity when administered during the fetal period of pregnancy.",

Forty young growing pigs were assigned to five treatment groups: control; oil (linseed oil supplementation); C. officinalis 1 and 2 groups (linseed oil plus 3 ml/day of C. officinalis propylene glycol extracts); and vitamin E group (linseed oil plus 100 mg/kg of vitamin E). Lymphocyte DNA fragmentation and 24-h urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) excretion were measured to determine DNA damage. Lipid peroxidation was studied by analysing plasma and urine malondialdehyde (MDA), and urine isoprostane concentrations (iPF2α-VI), total antioxidant status of plasma and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) assays. C. officinalis 1 (extract from petals) effectively protected DNA from oxidative damage. It indicated a numerical trend towards the reduction of plasma MDA and urinary iPF2α-VI excretion. Its effect was comparable with that of vitamin E. C. officinalis 2 (extract from flower tops) showed less antioxidant potential than the extract from petals. We can conclude that the amount of C. officinalis extracts proposed for internal use by traditional medicine protects the organism against DNA damage induced by high PUFA intake.",

One agent that has been utilized for centuries for the treatment of dermatological disorders and possesses a number of pharmacological actions that are conducive to wound healing is Calendula officinalis, or pot marigold. To assess the effect of Calendula on wound healing, a systematic review of the literature was conducted. The search was limited to randomized controlled trials that used topically administered monopreparations of Calendula officinalis for wounds of any type. Although 6 trials were identified, only 1 trial was of good quality; hence, the statistical pooling of results was not appropriate. Therefore, a narrative review of these studies was conducted indicating that there is only weak evidence to support the topical administration of Calendula in acute and chronic wounds. Undoubtedly, further investigation is needed to establish whether Calendula has a place in mainstream wound care."

The effect was evaluated visually and quantified by noninvasive bioengineering methods, namely chromametry and tewametry. When the test products were applied parallel to the induction period of ICD, a statistically significant protective effect of all cream preparations was observed by all methods. This effect, although not statistically significant, was superior to control by undyed marigold und faradiol ester-enriched extracts in chromametry and by dyed and undyed rosemary extracts in tewametry. The sequential treatment (postirritation) once a day for 5 days was without any effect. Thus, a protective effect of some marigold and rosemary extracts against ICD could be shown in the elicitation phase.",

The goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of calendula (Pommade au Calendula par Digestion; Boiron Ltd, Levallois-Perret, France) with that of trolamine (Biafine; Genmedix Ltd, France), which is considered in many institutions to be the reference topical agent. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1999 and June 2001, 254 patients who had been operated on for breast cancer and who were to receive postoperative radiation therapy were randomly allocated to application of either trolamine (128 patients) or calendula (126 patients) on the irradiated fields after each session. The primary end point was the occurrence of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher. Prognostic factors, including treatment modalities and patient characteristics, were also investigated. Secondary end points were the occurrence of pain, the quantity of topical agent used, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The occurrence of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher was significantly lower (41% v 63%; P <.001) with the use of calendula than with trolamine. Moreover, patients receiving calendula had less frequent interruption of radiotherapy and significantly reduced radiation-induced pain. Calendula was considered to be more difficult to apply, but self-assessed satisfaction was greater. Body mass index and adjuvant chemotherapy before radiotherapy after lumpectomy were significant prognostic factors for acute dermatitis. CONCLUSION: Calendula is highly effective for the prevention of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher and should be proposed for patients undergoing postoperative irradiation for breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Calendula officinalis (marigold) has many pharmacological properties. It is used for the treatment of skin disorders, pain and also as a bactericide, antiseptic and anti-inflammatory. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are known to participate in the pathogenesis of various human diseases and may be involved in the conditions which C. officinalis is used to treat. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the beneficial properties of this plant and its antioxidant action. The butanolic fraction (BF) was studied because it is non-cytotoxic and is rich in a variety of bioactive metabolites including flavonoids and terpenoids. Superoxide radicals (O(2)(*-)) and hydroxyl radicals (HO(*)) are observed in decreasing concentrations in the presence of increasing concentrations of BF with IC(50) values of 1.0 +/- 0.09 mg/ml and 0.5 +/- 0.02 mg/ml, respectively, suggesting a possible free radical scavenging effect. Lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes induced by Fe(2+)/ascorbate was 100% inhibited by 0.5 mg/ml of BF (IC(50) = 0.15 mg/ml). Its total reactive antioxidant potential (TRAP) (in microM Trolox equivalents) was 368.14 +/- 23.03 and its total antioxidant reactivity (TAR) was calculated to be 249.19 +/- 14.5 microM. The results obtained suggest that the butanolic fraction of C. officinalis possesses a significant free radical scavenging and antioxidant activity and that the proposed therapeutic efficacy of this plant could be due, in part, to these properties.",

Both organic and aqueous extracts were relatively nontoxic to human lymphocytic Molt-4 cells, but only the organic one exhibited potent anti-HIV activity in an in vitro MTT/tetrazolium-based assay. In addition, in the presence of the organic extract (500 micrograms/mL), the uninfected Molt-4 cells were completely protected for up to 24 h from fusion and subsequent death, caused by cocultivation with persistently infected U-937/HIV-1 cells. It was also found that the organic extract from Calendula officinalis flowers caused a significant dose- and time-dependent reduction of HIV-1 reverse transcription (RT) activity. An 85% RT inhibition was achieved after a 30 min treatment of partially purified enzyme in a cell-free system. These results suggested that organic extract of flowers from Calendula officinalis possesses anti-HIV properties of therapeutic interest.",

Various particulate fractions from 14-day-old seedlings catalyze the esterification of the steryl glucosides with utilization of endogenous acyl donors. The activity seems to be associated mainly with the membranous structures being fragments of Golgi complex, as it has previously been suggested for UDPG: sterol glucosyltransferase. Succesive treatment of the particulate enzyme fraction with Triton X-100 and acetone affords a soluble acyltransferase preparation partly depleted of endogenous lipids. As a source of acyl groups for the synthesis of steryl acylglucosides this preparation utilizes various phospholipids obtained from the same plant in the following sequence: phosphatidylinositol greater than phosphatidylethanolamine greater than phosphatidylcholine. It does not utilize triacylglycerols and monogalactosyldiacylglycerols.",
