      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Yuba is a worldwide popular soybean product, but its development is currently challenged by the time-consuming fabrication process. RESULTS: In this study, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the formation rate and tensile strength of yuba films by introducing calcium ions and sodium metabisulfite (SM). Results show that calcium ion increased the density and continuity of the yuba films, while SM led to the formation of larger protein particles. Moreover, dynamic light scattering indicated that the size of the largest protein particles increased from 112.8 to 408.6 nm as the concentration of SM rose from 0 to 20 mmol L-1. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results revealed a strong correlation between the formation of large protein particles and the release of basic polypeptides from glycinin (11S) during SM treatment. Furthermore, the blue shift of the maximum emission wavelengths of fluorescence intensity suggested that the exposed hydrophobic residues of the basic polypeptides became trapped inside the protein particles upon heating. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the structure and functional properties of protein particles significantly impacted the formation rate and tensile strength of yuba films. These findings offer valuable and fundamental insights for the advancement of industrial production of yuba films. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "Objectives: Ischemic stroke is a severe neurological disorder with high morbidity, mortality, and disability rates, posing a substantial burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems. Soy isoflavone (SI), a naturally occurring phytoestrogen, has demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-stroke efficacy of SI and elucidate its underlying mechanisms through integrated phytochemical profiling, network pharmacology, and both in vitro and in vivo experimental validation. Methods: Active constituents of SI were extracted via reflux and identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Network pharmacology was employed to predict therapeutic targets and signaling pathways. The neuroprotective effects of SI were first assessed in PC12 cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury in vitro. For in vivo evaluation, transient cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced using the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) model in adult male ICR rats (27.3 ± 1.8 g; 6-8 weeks old), obtained from the Shanghai Experimental Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Forty-eight rats were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 12): sham, model (BCCAO), SI-treated (100 mg/kg, oral gavage for 5 days), and edaravone (EDA)-treated (10 mg/kg, i.p., positive control). All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Changchun Normal University (Approval No. 2024003, 13 March 2024) and conducted in accordance with the NIH guidelines and ARRIVE 2.0 reporting standards. Results: In vitro, SI significantly enhanced PC12 cell viability from 57.23 ± 2.88% to 80.76 ± 4.43% following OGD/R. It also reduced intracellular Ca2+ by 58.42%, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release by 37.67%, caspase-3 activity by 55.05%, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by 74.13% (p < 0.05). A flow cytometry analysis revealed that OGD/R increased the apoptosis rate from 5.34% (control) to 30.85% (model group), which was significantly attenuated by SI treatment, especially in the 560 µg/mL group (20.00%), followed by the 140 and 280 µg/mL groups. In vivo, SI improved neurological scores from 8.3 ± 1.09 to 6.8 ± 1.68, reduced cerebral infarction volume by 18.49%, and alleviated brain edema by 10.42% (p < 0.05). SI also decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and LDH levels by 31.15% and 39.46%, respectively, while increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 11.70%, catalase (CAT) by 26.09%, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) by 27.55% (p < 0.01). Scratch assay results showed that SI restored the impaired migratory ability of the OGD/R-treated PC12 cells, further supporting its role in cellular repair. A Western blot analysis demonstrated the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and the downregulation of Kelch-like, ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model. Conclusions: These findings indicate that soy isoflavone confers significant neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by enhancing endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms, reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting cell migration. The protective effects are likely mediated through the activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway, supporting the therapeutic potential of SI in ischemic stroke treatment."

      "abstract": "Okara is a major by-product of soybean processing, which not only has negative impacts on the environment but also leads to resource waste. Soybean residue is rich in insoluble dietary fiber, which is known to have a positive effect on ulcerative colitis. This study aimed to investigate whether long-term consumption of high-purity soy isolate dietary fiber (HPSIDF) promotes the proliferation of beneficial intestinal substances, thereby alleviating intestinal damage caused by chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC). This study induced CUC using 2 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and conducted a three-phase (9-week) intervention experiment. The study showed that long-term consumption of HPSIDF can regulate the level of inflammatory factors in mice and relieve damage to intestinal tissue. In addition, long-term intake of HPSIDF inhibited the degradation of Lactobacillus intestinalis and promoted the proliferation of Oscillospira and the production of beneficial substances such as Agmatine and Betaine, which played an important role in the maintenance of intestinal bacterial flora and the improvement of the internal environment. This study clarified that long-term intake of HPSIDF not only changes the intestinal self-properties but also promotes the proliferation of beneficial flora and metabolites, providing a solution strategy for the high-value utilization of okara.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the influence of ultrasound treatment on the structural and gelation properties of soy protein isolate (SPI)-Sesbania gum (SG) composite gels induced by varying concentrations of CaSO4. The results showed that ultrasound treatment at amplitudes ranging from 20 % to 60 % for 10 min improved protein solubility, rheological properties and gel strength. The addition of CaSO4 (15 to 35 mM) further increased gel hardness but caused a decline in the water-holding capacity (WHC). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) demonstrated that ultrasound treatment promoted the formation of a more homogenous and compact network in SPI-SG gels, improving WHC. Although higher concentrations of CaSO4 resulted in an uneven network with larger pores and reduced WHC, ultrasound treatment mitigated the loss. Moreover, analysis of intermolecular forces revealed that ultrasound treatment enhanced hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds within the mixed gels induced by CaSO4, leading to a stronger gel network. These findings provided a novel strategy for improving SPI-based gel properties and offer a theoretical basis for the application of SPI-SG complex in food processing."

      "abstract": "Combining hot-alkali and pH-shift (HS) treatments is a convenient and economical way of modifying proteins. However, the cross-linked lysinoalanine (LAL) formed during this process affects edible-protein safety. This study investigated the conformational changes experienced by soybean protein isolate (SPI) during HS treatment and the mechanism associated with LAL cross-linking. Heating at 75 °C for 1 h at pH 12.0 was shown to result in the highest amount of LAL cross-linking. Reactive-group and spectral data revealed that HS treatment led to breakage of the internal disulfide bonds in SPI, as well as subunit depolymerization and collapse, with the highly disordered and flexible conformation of SPI eventually providing a favorable spatial effect for LAL cross-linking. Gel electrophoresis, particle size and ζ-potential analyses, SEM, and AFM revealed that thermal aggregation not only protects the SPI conformation against damage caused by extreme alkalinity, but also accelerates the rate of LAL cross-linking. In addition, the various SPI structures and the formation of cross-linked LAL were found to be strongly correlated (|r| > 0.7). This study clarified the synergistic mechanism associated with heat-alkali and pH-shift treatments that promote SPI conformational modifications and LAL cross-linking, and provides a theoretical basis for controlling the formation of LAL and improving the edible safety of SPI."

We analyzed the conformational evolution of the emulsion interface induced during the bulk demulsification, focusing on the oil-water interface. During the enzymatic treatment for 0-120 min, various spectral analyses including spectrum analyses of Raman, FT-IR, intrinsic fluorescence, and ultraviolet spectral analyses demonstrated gradual hydrolysis and polymerization of protein molecules within SPI/SHP, SPI, and SHP on the oil-water interface by trypsin, particularly noticeable during 30-90 min. Notably, at 90 min, an increase in β-sheet content and a red shift of the IR spectrum from 3400 to 3380 cm-1 indicated the conjugate effect of small molecules due to large interfacial tension, accompanied by hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding. These alterations in SPI/SHP, SPI, and SHP conformations at the oil-water interface led to droplet demulsification and oil phase release."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Black Cohosh, Soy Isoflavones, and SDG Lignans in alleviating menopausal symptoms compared to a placebo. METHODS: Ninety-six postmenopausal women aged 45-60 years were enrolled. Participants were randomized to receive either the study supplements or a placebo for 90 days, with Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) scores collected at baseline and every 4 weeks to monitor symptom changes. Secondary outcomes assessed included hormonal variations and the incidence of adverse symptoms. RESULTS: Of the initial cohort, 90 participants completed the study with high adherence. Significant improvements were observed in the treatment group across all MRS domains: somatic (- 54.3% difference, p < 0.01), psychological (- 54.3% difference, p < 0.01), urogenital (-37.3% difference, p < 0.01), and total score (- 48.0% difference, p < 0.01). Hormonal changes were modest yet statistically significant for FSH (- 6.7% difference, p < 0.01) and estradiol (12.6% difference, p < 0.01). Adverse events were minimal, transient, and did not require cessation of supplementation. CONCLUSION: Black Cohosh, Soy Isoflavones, and SDG Lignans significantly reduced menopausal symptoms with a favorable safety profile. These findings support the potential of this supplement combination as a therapeutic option for menopausal symptom management. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06328348.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is an important cause of exercise fatigue formation. Nutritional intervention is an important way to modulate exercise fatigue. Lactoferrin (LF) and soybean protein (SP) are potential antioxidant bioactive components. Our findings demonstrate that SP-LF hybrid hydrolysates had effective 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity and iron ion reducing ability. The synergistic effect between these hybrid hydrolysates were found to be superior to the single hydrolysate in terms of antioxidant level by the joint index analysis. These hybrid hydrolysates are characterized by high levels of amino acids with potential anti-fatigue effect: tyrosine (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe), hydrophobic amino acid (HAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). In murine models, hybrid hydrolysates significantly prolonged weight-bearing swimming time, increased muscle/liver glycogen levels, decreased lactate, urea nitrogen, and malondialdehyde levels, and increased glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and ATPase activities. Pearson's correlation analysis established significant associations between antioxidant capacity and anti-fatigue efficacy. It alleviated fatigue through activating the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, while increasing the expression levels of PGC-1α. These results collectively suggest that SP-LF hybrid hydrolysates demonstrate significant synergistic antioxidant and anti-fatigue activity and could be incorporated into functional foods as a dietary supplement to reduce fatigue."

Consequently, Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) species represented age-dependent increase with SIF treatment, subsequently, generally age-dependent decreased goblet cells are retained in the large intestine. These results invoke that SIF plays a beneficial role on intestinal barrier function to maintain the large intestine homeostasis. Interestingly, we also revealed that SIF had an alleviating effect on age-dependent bone loss. Taken together, SIF has fruitful effect on the intestinal environment and maintenance of homeostasis in physiological aging."

SPI-TG (30 U/g) significantly promoted the transformation of the secondary structure of protein from β-turns and random coils to β-sheets. In addition, electrophoretograms showed that there was a decrease in smaller molecular weight peptides and an increase in protein aggregates, which was consistent with the change in scanning electron microscopy. The thermal stability, viscosity and oil content of the SPI-TG treatment wheat flour were influenced by the degree of protein cross-linking. The changes in the structure and properties of wheat flour induced by SPI-TG treatment were beneficial to reducing the oil absorption of fried flour.

      "abstract": "Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) models can cause neurodevelopmental abnormalities like those observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Previous studies link experimental PAE effects in the brain to impaired signaling through insulin/IGF and Notch pathways that mediate neuronal survival, growth, migration, energy metabolism, and plasticity. Importantly, concurrent administration of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists or dietary soy prevented many aspects of FASD due to their insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Objective: To determine if dietary soy interventions during pregnancy would be sufficient to normalize central nervous system structure and function, we examined the effects of maternal gestation-limited dietary soy on cerebellar postnatal development, motor function, and critical signaling pathways. Methods: Pregnant Long Evans rats were fed isocaloric liquid diets containing 0% or 26% caloric ethanol with casein or soy isolate as the protein source. The ethanol and soy feedings were discontinued upon delivery. The offspring were subjected to rotarod motor function tests, and on postnatal day 35, they were sacrificed to harvest cerebella for histological and molecular studies. Results: Despite the postnatal cessation of alcohol exposure, chronic gestational exposure reduced brain weight, caused cerebellar hypoplasia, and impaired motor performance. Gestational dietary soy prevented the ethanol-associated reduction in brain weight and largely restored the histological integrity of the cerebellum but failed to normalize motor performance. Ethanol withdrawal abolished the impairments in insulin/IGF signaling that were previously associated with ongoing ethanol exposures, but ethanol's inhibitory effects on Notch and Wnt signaling persisted. Soy significantly increased cerebellar expression of the insulin and IGF-1 receptors and abrogated several ethanol-associated impairments in Notch and Wnt signaling. Conclusions: Although gestation-restricted dietary soy has significant positive effects on neurodevelopment, optimum prevention of FASD's long-term effects will likely require dietary soy intervention during the critical periods of postnatal development, even after alcohol exposures have ceased.",

Enzymatic hydrolysis facilitates the unfolding of SPI, leading to the exposure of chromogenic fluorophores and hydrophobic amino acid residues, which in turn promotes an increase in free sulfhydryl content. Concurrently, this process induces the transformation of α-helix and β-sheet into β-turn and random coil. The enzyme modification enhances the solubility, emulsification, and foaming activities of SPI and significantly augment its antioxidant properties (p < 0.05). However, this enzymatic treatment adversely affects the stability of its emulsification and foaming properties. Subsequent to enzymatic hydrolysis, soy milk powder demonstrated a reduction in particle size and an improvement in solubility, which significantly enhanced its flavor profile. In summary, alcalase offers substantial advantages in augmenting the functional properties of SPI and increasing the solubility of soy milk powder. However, this process adversely affects the flavor profile of soy milk powder, a consequence attributed to the broad hydrolysis specificity of alcalase."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, soy protein-based food is consumed globally as an eco-friendly and healthy plant-based alterative. Nevertheless, more effort is still needed to improve the functionalities of soy protein for a wider application and addressing its existing challenges. Heat treatment is a fundamental approach in industrial food processing due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and versatility. This review gave an emphasis on the recent advance in improving the functionalities of soy protein by heat treatment, including traditional and innovative heating, as well as a combination of heating and other techniques. Traditional thermal treatment has been proven to effectively improve the techno-functional properties of soy protein (e.g., heat stability; emulsifying, foaming, and gelation properties; and fibrillation), or to overcome its drawbacks (e.g., nutritional issues and antigenicity), or to promote its interactions with other compounds for novel functionalities via complicated protein changes (including conformational changes (e.g., unfolding, secondary and tertiary structures, surface hydrophobicity/charge) and covalent and/or non-covalent aggregation, as well as binding with other compounds). Recently, researchers have also proposed innovative heating and combination of heating and other techniques for a more efficient and effective soy protein modification. This review gave hints for a more precise and tailored modulation of soy protein functionalities via heat treatment in the commercial application.",

      "abstract": "Soy protein's processing traits such as gelation depend on molecular unfolding and aggregation; however, the relationship between structural changes and gelation remains unclear. The results show that the conformationally flexible regions of acidic subunits (A) are primarily composed of β-strands (E42 → P90) and an extended region featuring a helix (V186 → V262). The regions of the basic subunit (B) consist of a β-turn region (L34 → Q50) and a segment with three helical structures (K125 → S155). Under alkaline-heat treatment, the helical region of subunit A closes, resulting in a stable structure, leading to a 50 %-54 % decrease in the binding energy between subunits A and B, making them more prone to dissociation. The subunit B extends its structure, increasing the binding energy by 63 %-69 % and promoting the formation of highly stable aggregates through self-assembly.

In this study, ellagic acid as a solid hydrophobic substance and Litsea Cubeba essential oil as an oily hydrophobic component were successfully loaded using heat- and ultrasonic- treated soy protein as a carrier. Ellagic acid was initially loaded into treated soy protein via pH-shifting. A stable Pickering emulsion was then prepared with Litsea Cubeba essential oil and solid particles adsorbed at the oil-water interface. This emulsion exhibited high centrifugal, thermal, and pH stability. When incorporated into a sodium alginate coating, the Pickering emulsion enhanced the antioxidant properties and shelf life of grapes. The results suggest heat and ultrasonic treatment are a promising approach for protein based hydrophobic compounds co-delivery system, improving dispersion and antioxidant capacity, thereby advancing co-delivery systems in food science.",

It was revealed that recrystallisation of ice crystals during the F-T treatment induced protein structural reorganization. This resulted in a reduction of the gels' water-holding capacity (WHC). F-T decreased the amount of soluble protein by encouraging protein buildup through disulfide bonds and hydrophobic contacts. 5 F-T results were the most significant. When the 11S/7S ratio exceeded 1:1.5, the F-T exerted a more disruptive effect on the protein gel, leading to an increase in β-sheet and random coil content. When 11S/7S was less than 1:1.5, F-T had less impact, and the decrease in WHC was reduced. This study provides theoretical support for regulating soybean protein components to improve the F-T stability of soybean protein gels.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is divided into primary and secondary types. Primary osteoporosis may result from estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women, imbalanced bone remodeling in the elderly, or imbalanced adolescent-type bone development. Secondary osteoporosis can be caused by factors like long-term glucocorticoid treatment, chronic kidney disease (CKD), estrogen deprivation, oxidative stress, diabetes, and obesity. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of soy isoflavones for osteoporosis. At the cellular level, soy isoflavones, as natural plant extracts and phytoestrogens, are crucial for osteoblastogenesis and differentiation, osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast mineralization, and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation. They also maintain calcium homeostasis by regulating extracellular calcium and vitamin D levels. In terms of oxidative stress, soy isoflavones mitigate it in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, thus regulating cellular senescence, autophagy, and bone remodeling processes. Moreover, soy isoflavones can relieve symptoms related to CKD and inhibit glucocorticoid secretion, which directly or indirectly benefits the treatment of osteoporosis. Overall, soy isoflavones have the potential to treat osteoporosis by enhancing bone health, regulating metabolism, and alleviating oxidative stress. Future research should explore the potential of soy isoflavones as phytoestrogens for treating osteoporosis. This exploration should focus on clarifying the safety, identifying potential side effects, determining the optimal dosage regimen, and developing strategies to mitigate any adverse reactions. In addition, further large-scale, multicenter human clinical trials are necessary to accurately evaluate the actual therapeutic effect of soy isoflavones on osteoporosis.",

This study aimed to compare the effects of the Vitagnus, soy, and Vitagnus-soy combination on PMS in students. METHODS: This triple-blind, three-arm clinical trial was conducted on 108 students with PMS living in the dormitory of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences from September 2022 to October 2023. Eligible participants diagnosed with moderate to severe PMS over two menstrual cycles, using the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences form, were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Each participant took one daily capsule of Vitagnus (N=36), Soy (N=36), or a Vitagnus-soy combination (N=36) for two menstrual cycles. The data were analyzed using the ANOVA test (or Kruskal-Wallis test) with post-hoc tests based on Tukey (or Bonferroni correction), Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact method), and Wilcoxon test analysis (or paired t-test) in SPSS software version 26 with the significance level of P<0.05. RESULTS: In all three groups, PMS symptoms significantly reduced after the intervention (P<0.001). The Vitagnus-soy combination was more effective than either Soy or Vitagnus group in decreasing psychological (P<0.001) and total PMS symptoms (P<0.001). Vitagnus-soy combination had no statistically significant difference in decreasing physical PMS symptoms compared to Soy (P>0.999), but it was more effective than Vitagnus (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The Vitagnus-soy combination was more effective in alleviating PMS psychological and total symptoms than using either Soy or Vitagnus alone, making it a recommended option for reducing PMS symptoms.Trial Registration Number: IRCT2022072005514N.",

      "abstract": "Gynecomastia is an enlargement of the breasts in men, which is usually benign but can also manifest as a result of malignancies, and can be either unilateral or bilateral. Pseudogynecomastia is male breast enlargement due to excessive fat, while true gynecomastia is a proliferation of glandular tissue. Gynecomastia is common in infants, adolescents, and elderly men, with the most common cause is related to hormonal changes associated with aging. Medical intervention is usually required for true gynecomastia that has lasted more than a year. Here, we report a case of a 33-year-old Chinese-Indonesian decent with enlarged breasts. The patient reported frequent consumption of homemade soybean milk (1/2 to 1 liter daily) accompanied by bland chicken during his body-building regimen. The patient had discontinued the regimen and the diet for 2 years prior to the initial visit. During physical examination, both breasts were enlarged and had firm nodule, mobile, and attached at the sub-central areola mammae with a diameter of 8 cm. The patient was then diagnosed with true gynecomastia Simon degree 2A and Geschikter and Copeland type 3. As the gynecomastia had persisted longer than a year, a dermatological intervention was planned. Ultrasound-assisted liposuction was performed with a solid probe and glandular excision. Fat tissue was obtained, 130 mL from the right breast and 120 mL from the left breast. A dense 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 2 cm glandular tissue was obtained from both breasts. The patient was satisfied with the surgery outcome."

How to effectively promote the binding of polyphenols to protein is still a difficult topic. In this study, hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) was used to induce the fabrication of complexes between soy protein isolate (SPI) and different polyphenols (tannic acid (TA), chlorogenic acid (CGA), ferulic acid (FA), caffeic acid (CA), and gallic acid (GA)). The effect of HC on the interaction between polyphenols and SPI was investigated, and the structural and functional properties of the formed complexes were characterized. The results showed that HC treatment led to SPI structure stretching, which increased the binding level of polyphenols, especially that of TA (increased from 35.08 ± 0.73% to 66.42 ± 1.35%). The increase in ultraviolet-visible absorption intensity and quenching of fluorescence intensity confirmed that HC enhanced the interaction between polyphenols and protein. HC treatment reduced the contents of free sulfhydryl and amino groups in SPI-polyphenol complexes and altered their Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, indicating that HC treatment promoted the formation of C-N and C-S bonds between SPI and polyphenols. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that HC treatment altered the secondary structure of SPI-polyphenol complexes, inducing an increase in α-helix and random coil contents and a decrease in β-sheet content. Regarding functional properties, HC treatment improved the emulsification and antioxidant activity of SPI-polyphenol complexes. Therefore, HC is an effective technique for promoting the binding of polyphenols to protein."

Tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, is widely used; however, approximately 40% of patients develop resistance. Recent studies indicate that microRNAs, especially miR-155, play a critical role in this resistance. Our analysis of MCF-7 tamoxifen-sensitive (TAM-S) and tamoxifen-resistant (TAM-R) cells revealed that miR-155 is significantly upregulated in TAM-R cells. Overexpression of miR-155 in TAM-S cells increased resistance to tamoxifen. Additionally, genistein, a natural isoflavone from soybeans, effectively downregulated miR-155 and its targets associated with apoptosis and glucose metabolism, including STAT3 and hexokinase 2 (HK2). Notably, genistein also significantly decreased cell migration, suggesting potential anti-metastatic effects. Furthermore, genistein reduced glucose consumption, indicating its potential to overcome miR-155-mediated tamoxifen resistance and modulate the Warburg effect. These findings highlight genistein as a promising therapeutic agent for overcoming tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer and merit further investigation.",

The results indicated that microwaving for 60 s significantly altered the structure of 7S, resulting in a more ordered protein configuration. The treated protein exhibited the largest particle size (152.3 nm), lowest polydispersity index (0.248), highest α-helix content (47.86%), and lowest β-sheet, β-turn, and random coil contents (12.33%, 16.07%, and 22.41%, respectively). It also showed the lowest endogenous fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity, and the highest thermal denaturation temperature (76.8 °C). Additionally, microwaving for ≤90 s led to increased peptide modifications, with carbamylation and deamidation being the most prevalent. A microwave treatment time of 60 s also notably enhanced the functional properties of glycosylated soybean 7S protein, optimizing water-holding capacity (6.060 g/g), emulsification activity, and stability (45.191 m2/g and 33.63 min). The foaming capacity was second only to the 120 s treatment (32% at 60 s versus 34% at 120 s), though the oil-holding capacity (22.73 g/g) and foaming stability (33.42%) were significantly lower than those of the controls. Microwave treatment durations exceeding or below 60 s led to the structural disintegration of the protein, diminishing most of its functional properties. This study explores the mechanism of how microwave processing time affects the structure and functional properties of glycosylated soybean 7S protein and identifies 60 s as the optimal microwave processing time. It meets the demands for healthy and delicious food in home cooking, providing scientific evidence for using microwave processing technology to enhance the nutritional value and quality of food."

      "abstract": "Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of low acid-binding capacity (ABC) specialty soy protein sources on weanling pig performance. In experiment 1, 2,260 pigs, initially weighed 6.7 kg, were used to determine the effects of low ABC soy proteins as a replacement to poultry meal (PM) or spray-dried blood plasma (SDBP). Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial plus a control diet fed in two phases. There were 20 or 21 pigs per pen with 22 replications (pens) per treatment. The control diet contained PM (AV-E Digest, XFE Products, Des Moines, IA) and SDBP (Appetein, APC Inc., Ankeny, IA). Specialty soy protein concentrate (SSPC; AX3 Digest, Protekta, Newport Beach, CA) and microbial-enhanced soybean meal (MESBM; MEPRO; Prairie Aquatech, Brookings, SD) were used to replace PM or PM and SDBP on a standardized ileal digestible Lys basis. From d 0 to 21 and d 0 to 42, pigs fed either soy protein source replacing PM had greater (P ≤ 0.016) average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake than pigs fed PM. From d 0 to 21, pigs fed SSPC had increased (P < 0.001) G:F compared with pigs fed MESBM and those fed either soy protein source replacing SDBP had increased (P = 0.044) G:F compared with pigs fed SDBP. In experiment 2, 1,057 pigs, initially weighed 6.2 kg, were used to determine the effects of diet ABC at a pH of 4 (ABC-4) with specialty soy proteins with or without pharmacological levels of Zn from ZnO. Experimental diets were fed in two phases with 22 pigs per pen and 12 replications per treatment. Dietary treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial with main effects of ABC-4 (low or high) and pharmacological levels of Zn from ZnO (105 or 2,000 mg/kg). The low ABC-4 diet without ZnO was formulated to 150 and 200 meq/kg using SSPC in phases 1 and 2, respectively. The high ABC-4 diet used enzymatically treated soybean meal (HP 300, Hamlet Protein, Findlay, OH) which increased the ABC-4 by 127 and 104 meq/kg in phases 1 and 2, respectively. From d 0 to 21 and d 0 to 42, there was an ABC-4 × ZnO interaction (P ≤ 0.026) observed where pigs fed low ABC-4 diets had greater (P < 0.05) ADG and G:F than pigs fed high ABC-4 diets without ZnO, but when diets contained added ZnO, there were no differences based on ABC-4. In conclusion, low ABC specialty soy proteins can be used to achieve low dietary ABC-4 levels to improve the performance of weanling pigs and provide a similar response to those fed pharmacological levels of Zn."

The results of UV and fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the heat treatment exposed the amino acid residues to a more hydrophobic environment. The mean volume diameter (d4,3) of PPI was reduced from 67.25 ± 3.31 to 45.50 ± 0.62 μm, and secondary structure of protein became more ordered. The addition of SHP enhanced the adsorption of protein at the oil-water interface and reduced the interfacial tension. Interestingly, SHP decreased the short-term (12h) thermal stability index (TSI) from 3.5 to 2.8 in PPI/SHP emulsion treated at 100 °C. These findings validated that heat treatment combined with SHP modification can improve the emulsification of PPI, which positively impacts the development of pea-based products for high temperatures applications.",

As a result, the GG-SPI complexes stabilized emulsion exhibited a minimum emulsion particle size (945 ± 23 nm), a maximum absolute values of zeta-potential (-32.7 ± 0.81 mV), the highest values of emulsion activity index (EAI) and stability index (ESI) (132 ± 4.7 min) when emulsion was prepared under the following conditions: oil phase ratio of 18 %, polysaccharide-protein proportion of 1:8 (w/w), homogeneous pressure at 80 MPa and homogeneous time at 4 min. GG-SPI emulsion had the best emulsification performance at pH 9.0 and 75 °C owing to the protein defolding occurred, the content of α-Helix increased, hydrophobic groups were exposed, and the number of negative groups on the surface of proteins increased under the high pH and high temperature conditions. The experimental results revealed the key role of heating and pH treatment for protein emulsion stability regulation, which will enrich the application of gellan gum in soy protein emulsions and provide an important theoretical basis for the future application of emulsion modification.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The escalating global prevalence of food allergies has intensified the need for hypoallergenic food products. Transglutaminase (TGase)-mediated crosslinking has garnered significant attention for its potential to reduce the allergenicity of food proteins. This study aimed to investigate the effects of TGase crosslinking on the potential allergenicity and conformational changes in a dual-protein system composed of β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) and soy protein isolate (SPI) at varying mass ratios (10:0, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7 and 0:10 (w/w)). RESULTS: TGase preferentially crosslinked the 7S and 11S subunits of soy protein, rather than β-LG. Crosslinking treatment reduced the allergenic potential of both soy protein and β-LG, with the degree of reduction depending on the protein ratio. The β-LG5:SPI5 and β-LG7:SPI3 mixtures showed the most significant reduction in antibody reactivity towards soy protein and β-LG, respectively. Additionally, TGase-mediated crosslinking significantly reduced the binding capacity of all dual-protein samples to serum immunoglobulin E from allergic patients, compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The allergenicity reduction was accompanied by structural modifications, including a decrease in β-sheet content, an increase in β-turn and random coil structures, enhanced ultraviolet absorption and intrinsic fluorescence, reduced free sulfhydryl levels and altered intermolecular forces. These changes suggest that TGase-induced crosslinking may disrupt or mask allergenic epitopes, thus lowering allergenicity. CONCLUSION: TGase crosslinking effectively reduced the allergenic potential of the dual-protein system by inducing structural changes. These findings underscore the potential of TGase in developing hypoallergenic dual-protein food products and provide a scientific foundation for future research and application in the food industry. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To investigate whether continuous intervention using soymilk containing high soy protein improves physical frailty, a randomized controlled trial was conducted among the Japanese pre-frail and frail elderly. METHODS: Japanese pre-frail and frail elderly participants (n = 73) were randomly assigned to the high-soy protein and control groups, who then ingested soymilk containing 14.5 g/200 ml and 3.2 g/200 ml of soy protein, respectively. Before and after the 12-week intervention, walking speed, skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, and the revised Japanese CHS questionnaire regarding fatigue and physical activity were examined to evaluate the impact of each soymilk on physical frailty and compare the variation between the two groups. Physical activity (monitored using a pedometer), dietary intake (determined by questionnaire), and estimated protein intake (determined by casual urine testing) were also recorded before and after the intervention. RESULTS: For the final analysis of the entire cohort (n = 70), there were no significant differences in the endpoints between the two groups. In the subgroup analysis, among participants with a walking speed of at least 1 m/s (n = 35, P = 0.012) and at least 5,000 steps/day before intervention (n = 27, P = 0.0083), the variation in walking speed after the 12-week intervention was significantly higher in the high-soy protein group than in the control group. Estimated protein intake was also significantly higher in the high-soy protein group than in the control group after the intervention. Regarding physical activity and dietary intake, no significant differences were observed between the groups before or after the intervention. CONCLUSION: The continuous 12-week intervention of high soy protein increased the walking speed among the Japanese pre-frail and frail elderly participants who had an ordinarily high walking speed and high step counts.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soy protein isolate (SPI) has poor emulsifying ability because of its low molecular flexibility and compact structure, limiting its application in extruded protein-based foods. Extrusion technology has emerged as a promising way to alter the structural properties of proteins. Therefore, the impacts of grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) on structural and emulsifying characteristics of SPI in extrusion field were explored in this study. RESULTS: After extrusion treatment, the molecular chains of SPI were unfolded. In comparison with extruded SPI, the interaction with GSP led to a rightward shift in particle size distribution and an enhancement in zeta potential values of the protein. As GSP concentration increased from 20 to 80 g kg-1, the free sulfhydryl content of SPI was reduced by 4.17%, 25%, 29.24% and 35.85% compared with that of extruded SPI. The addition of GSP altered the secondary structure of SPI and enhanced the microenvironment polarity. Meanwhile, SDS-PAGE results indicated that the protein presented lower molecular weight with the introduction of GSP. Compared with extruded SPI, the supplementation with GSP increased the molecular flexibility while it decreased the surface hydrophobicity of SPI. Correlation analyses demonstrated that these structural changes induced an improvement in emulsifying activity and emulsion stability of SPI. GSP mainly binds to SPI through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions under the extrusion environment. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that GSP is a potential modifier, which can be applied to improve the emulsifying capacity of extruded SPI-based foods. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

This study assesses the effect of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum synergistic fructo-oligosaccharide (Lp-FOS) intervention using an allergic mouse model induced by soy protein. The results showed that Lp synergistic FOS significantly decreased clinical allergy scores, inhibited specific antibodies (IgE, IgG, and IgG1), IL-4, IL-6, and IL-17A levels, and increased IFN-γ and IL-10 levels. Meanwhile, flow cytometry showed that Lp-FOS intervention inhibited the percentage of dendritic cell (DC) subsets in splenocytes and increased the Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 ratios. Furthermore, Lp-FOS intervention upregulated the mRNA levels of T-bet and Foxp3 and downregulated the mRNA levels of GATA3. Finally, non-targeted metabolomic analysis showed that Lp-FOS improved serum metabolic disorders caused by food allergies through regulating glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, butanoate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, the biosynthesis of cofactors, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. These data showed that the combination formulation Lp-FOS could be a promising adjuvant treatment for food allergies."

The results demonstrated that transglutaminase treatment significantly enhanced the water-holding and oil-binding capacities by 34.62 % and 49.28 %, respectively, along with the emulsifying properties. Furthermore, transglutaminase treatment significantly enhanced the UV absorption intensity by 36.89 % and strengthened the intermolecular interactions. The relative crystallinity and ΔH were elevated by 15.08 % and 34.39 %, respectively, which significantly enhanced the thermal stability of the complex. Overall, the transglutaminase-treated complex displayed improved physicochemical properties, with a more organized, uniform, and denser internal structure.

Ultrasound treatment at pH 8.0 and 2.0 significantly reduced the particle size of ISPH and enhance their ζ-potential, promoting uniform dispersion in water and improving solubility. In addition, ISPH modified by ultrasound treatment at pH 2.0 and 8.0 contributed to the formation of short, worm-like nanofibrils with characteristic cross-β structure. Ultrasound treatment (250 W) at pH 2.0 conferred the highest surface hydrophobicity (H0) to ISPH, resulting in the increase (9.30 %) in the content of antiparallel β-sheets after heating for 12 h.

The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy showed that COS modified the secondary and tertiary structure of SPI by covalent binding. The SPI/COS conjugate with a mass ratio of SPI and COS of 4:1 (SPI/COS-4) exhibited high glycosylation degree, great water solubility and better emulsification properties. Carvacrol-loaded emulsion stabilized by the SPI/COS-4 (CE-SPI/COS-4) had nanoscale droplet size and remained stable during 40 days of storage. SPI/COS-4 aqueous solution (SPI/COS) and CE-SPI/COS-4 aqueous solution (CE-SPI/COS) in the form of immersion were applied to investigate their preservation effects on sea bass, with sterile water as control check (CK). Sea bass were stored at 4 °C and quality assessments of fish were performed periodically for up to 21 days, which included microbiological and physicochemical analysis. As suggested by microbiological analysis, CE-SPI/COS treatment could significantly inhibit the bacterial growth. The low total volatile basic nitrogen value, thiobarbituric acid value and K-value indicated that CE-SPI/COS greatly retarded protein and lipid oxidation in fish and significantly suppress the degradation of nucleotide. Moreover, fish treated with CE-SPI/COS had minimal color variation and water loss, and maintained hardness, adhesiveness, chewiness, and resilience of fish to the highest degree. Therefore, emulsions stabilized with SPI/COS conjugates may be employed as a potential strategy for the quality maintenance of sea bass.",

Particle size analysis revealed that SPH addition decreased the particle size of EYS. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the surface of EYS roughened and SPH molecules attached to the surface.

      "abstract": "To improve the emulsion gel system of single soybean isolate protein (SPI) and to broaden the application field of hemp protein isolate (HPI), ultrasonic treatment and HPI were introduced to improve the properties of SPI emulsion gel and to explore the mechanism. The results showed that the gel strength (218.6 g) and water-holding capacity (86.24 %) of the emulsion gels were improved under ultrasonic treatments when the ratio of SPI:HPI was >6:4, and the reticulation structure of the gels was enhanced. When the ratio of SPI:HPI was <6:4, the gel structure was loose and formless. Ultrasonic treatment has a significant effect on the emulsion gel with the ratio of SPI:HPI was >6:4. Appropriate ultrasonic treatment (400 W) changed the protein structure, improved the rheological properties of emulsion gels to form the protein-oil-coated network structure. However, excessive ultrasonic treatment (600 W) will destroy the conformation of the protein, reducing the stability of the structure. The effect of ultrasonic treatment on emulsion gels with the ratio of SPI:HPI was <6:4 is low, but improved the gel protein digestibility. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of ultrasonic in composite protein emulsion gels systems and the development and application of HPI.",

      "abstract": "Regulating volatile compounds release through protein structural modification can influence food sensory properties. This study investigated the effects of controlled enzymatic hydrolysis (CEH) on the release of off-flavor compounds identified in soybean protein isolate (SPI) and revealed its potential mechanism of influence. CEH treatment significantly reduced the release of aldehydes, particularly (E, E)-2,4-decadienal, by inducing the unfolding of SPI unfolding. This structural modification exposed additional binding sites, thereby increasing the affinity of SPI for aldehyde compounds and effectively limiting aldehyde volatility. Multi-spectroscopic techniques, surface hydrophobicity, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses confirmed these structural changes. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis suggested that non-covalent interactions, dominated by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, were the primary factors driving these changes, as further confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and independent gradient model (IGM) analysis. Additionally, proteomics revealed that covalent binding, including Michael addition and Schiff base reactions, also influenced the aldehydes release.",

This study investigated soy protein isolate (SPI) alterations of digestibility and structure, as well as the formation of potentially hazardous chemicals, i.e., advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs), after interacting with malondialdehyde (MDA, a lipid oxidation product) under high-temperature cooking conditions (100-180 °C, up to 60 min). In-vitro protein digestion of the SPI-MDA mixtures suggested that their room-temperature interactions damaged SPI digestibility, and increasing the temperature and the duration of the thermal treatment exacerbated the adverse effects. Protein oxidation, covalent aggregation of subunits, and changes in secondary and tertiary structures were revealed using thiol quantification, gel electrophoresis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD) spectra, which could explain reduced protein digestibility. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) identified seven non-crosslinked ALEs and two crosslinked ALEs. Increased MDA concentrations promoted the generation of ALEs. Moreover, the acrolein-derived ALEs with reactive carbonyl groups were prone to further reacting into crosslinked ALEs, potentially responsible for the subunit aggregation.",

The physical modification of both SPI and WPI was monitored using SDS-PAGE, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), measuring interfacial tension, color, solubility, foam volume, foam stability, and, finally, the density and oil absorption of the produced cryogel. The findings revealed that the application of ultrasonic waves resulted in a significant reduction in the content of alpha-helical of SPI and WPI while the other treatments increased the content of random coil proteins. FTIR analysis further showed that ultrasonic and heat treatment led to a decrease in C-N tensile vibration within the range of 1200-1650 cm-1 in SPI. Meanwhile, in cold plasma treatment, an increase was observed which was confirmed by the elevation of enthalpy from 100 to 128 kJ/kg. Physical treatments significantly altered the surface properties of both SPI and WPI, where this value was reduced in SPI and increased in WPI. The cold plasma method demonstrated superior performance in enhancing the solubility of SPI from 10 to 58.2%, while the solubility of WPI decreased from 96.4 to 90.4%. By modifying the proteins, the foam volume and oil adsorption ability of the related cryogel improved, as shown by the maximum oil absorption obtained after ultrasonic treatment for SPI (11.6 g/g) and cold plasma (9.17 g/g) for WPI. These results could be useful in applying physical treatments to modify proteins and create the cryogel as an oleogel template for structuring liquid oil and producing innovative health value-added foods.",

To investigate the effects of hydrodynamic cavitation treatment on the interactions between SPI and these polyphenols, the polyphenol binding capacity with SPI was measured and the changes in the exposed sulfhydryl and free amino contents were analyzed. Various methods, including ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy, were also used to characterize the structural properties of the SPI-polyphenol conjugates. The results showed that compared to untreated SPI, SPI treated with hydrodynamic cavitation exposed more active groups, facilitating a greater binding capacity with the polyphenols. After the hydrodynamic cavitation treatment, the ultraviolet-visible absorption of the SPI-polyphenol conjugates increased while the fluorescence intensity decreased. Additionally, the content of exposed sulfhydryl and free amino groups declined, and changes in the secondary structure were observed, characterized by an increase in the α-helix and random coil content accompanied by a decrease in the β-sheet and β-turn content. Furthermore, the SPI-polyphenol conjugates treated with hydrodynamic cavitation demonstrated improved emulsifying characteristics and antioxidant activity. As a result, hydrodynamic cavitation could be identified as an innovative technique for the preparation of protein-phenolic conjugates."

Altered reproductive function is a notable long-term consequence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In the current study, we assessed the effects of soya milk containing Lactobacillus casei and omega-3 on stereology of testes in type 1 diabetic rats. METHODS: 30 male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly allocated into five groups. Streptozocin (STZ (60 mg/kg)) was applied for diabetes induction. The non-diabetic and diabetic control groups were fed with 1 ml of distilled water. Three treatment diabetic groups were fed 1 ml of Soy milk group (SM), Probiotic soy milk group (PSM), and Omega-3 probiotic soy milk group (OPSM) via intragastric gavage for 60 days. At the endpoint, the animals were sacrificed and serum luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, MDA besides testicular, and seminal parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: The administration of soy milk supplemented with L. casei and omega-3 in diabetic rats elevated the concentrations of LH, FSH, testosterone, and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition, this combination improved sperm quality, enhanced the number of sperm with rapid progress, increased testis weight and volume, seminiferous tubule and germinal epithelium volume; and also augmented the number of spermatogonia, spermatocyte, round and long spermatids, Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with soy milk containing L. casei and omega-3 can inhibit T1DM-induced infertility rats through improving testicular parameters, enhancing sperm quality, and increasing Sertoli and Leydig cell number.",

      "abstract": "Genistein, an isoflavone found in soybeans, exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. This study explored the molecular mechanisms behind genistein's anticancer effects in prostate cancer DU145 cells. In this study, genistein decreased cell viability, increased annexin V-PE(+) cells, and enhanced the sub-G0/G1 peak by flow cytometric analysis. Increased reactive oxygen species increased mitochondrial depolarization indicating mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of ATP formation were also observed in genistein-treated DU145 cells. Genistein upregulated p53 at the mRNA and protein levels and increased caspase-3/7 activity along with the cleavage of Bax, procaspase-3, and PARP. With the increasing genistein concentrations, the percentage of cells in the sub-G0/G1 peak and G2/M phase increased, which was inhibited by treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD together with 100 μM genistein, which had little toxicity to normal prostate epithelial HPrEC cells. Genistein treatment simultaneously inhibited the activation of STAT3 and other closely related oncogenic kinases such as AKT and ERK and p38 and decreased VEGF expression. Taken together, these results suggest that genistein inhibits the growth of DU145 cells and induces apoptosis by inhibiting STAT3, AKT, ERK, and p38 which provides a molecular basis for the anticancer activity of genistein and suggests its potential as a valuable therapeutic candidate for prostate cancer."

To date, there is limited data in the literature regarding the effects of Tenebrio molitor meal on the modulation of gut microbiota in growing animals, with most results focusing on poultry rather than pigs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of replacing fermented soy protein concentrate with Tenebrio molitor meal on gut microbiota and feed digestibility in growing pigs. A total of 14 growing pigs (80 ± 2 days old) were randomly allotted to two groups: the control group (CON) was fed a commercial diet containing 4% fermented soy protein concentrate (48% crude protein), and the treatment group (TM) was fed a basal diet containing 5% of T. molitor larvae meal formulated to be isonitrogenous and isoenergetic. The study lasted 28 days. Animals were weekly weighted and feed refuse was routinely measured. Fecal, blood samples, and rectal swabs were collected for analysis. No differences were observed in growth and diet digestibility for the protein and lipid components throughout the trial. No differences in the serum concentrations of albumin, globulin, urea, and interleukin-6 were registered in both groups, suggesting an unaltered health status. The TM group showed a significant difference in the beta diversity index considering the total duration of the trial (treatment effect evaluated with PERMANOVA, R2 0.0771, p value = 0.0099) showing an increased abundance of Elusimicrobium spp. and a decrease in Asteroplasma spp. in TM compared to the CON group (p < 0.05). Obtained findings indicate that 5% T. molitor meal can be included as a partial replacement for soy in growing pig formula without impairing pig growth and gut microbiota composition.",

Due to preventive and therapeutic effects of soy isoflavones (SI) and broccoli extract (BE) on tumor angiogenesis, inflammation and oxidative stress and since endometriosis is accompanied by chronic inflammation, in this study, we aim to evaluate the potential role of these compounds on the pathological scores of endometriosis and also consider the expression level of the gene markers of autophagy, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in an endometriosis rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present experimental study, 45 mature female Sprague- Dawley rats weighing 220 ± 20 g at the age of eight weeks with surgically induced endometriosis was divided into five groups and treated for six weeks with normal saline (control group), BE, SI, BE+SI by oral gavage, and also Diphereline intramuscularly. The histopathological scores of the endometrial implants (0, 1, 2, 3: no, poorly, moderately and well-preserved epithelial layers, respectively) and the mRNA expression level of Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3, Beclin-1, Lc3, and Sod within peritoneal tissue were compared among the groups. RESULTS: Pathologic scores of the implants in the Diphereline (1.2 ± 0.27) and BE+SI (1.2 ± 0.41) groups were declined significantly in comparison with the control group (2.08 ± 0.44) (P≤0.001). In the endometriotic structures, the mRNA expression levels of our target genes were improved significantly (P≤0.01) in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings of the current study demonstrated that the simultaneous consumption of a certain amount of broccoli extract and SI can be considered as a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of endometriosis."

However, there are limited studies examining this effect in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of PS-enriched food consumption as part of a healthy dietary pattern (HDP) on blood pressure and endothelial function in Singaporean adults with MetS. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a 12-week, crossover, randomized controlled trial with a 4-week washout period. Thirteen subjects were instructed to consume an HDP diet either with normal soy milk (control group) or with PS (2 g/day)-enriched soy milk (PS group) for 4 weeks. Blood lipid-lipoproteins and glucose concentrations, blood pressure, and endothelial function-related indicators (flow-mediated dilation, total plasma nitrate/nitrite and endothelin-1, circulating endothelial progenitor cells) were assessed before and after the intervention. Systolic blood pressure [mean change, PS group: -4.0 ± 3.7 mmHg; control group: 5.9 ± 2.5 mmHg (PInteraction = 0.01)] and long-term CVD risk [mean change, PS group: -0.2 ± 1.0 %; control group: 2.7 ± 1.3 % (PInteraction = 0.03)] decreased following PS consumption. No changes were observed in the other endothelial function-related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of PS-enriched food with an HDP diet may lower blood pressure and long-term CVD risk in adults with MetS.

Results showed Ca2+ addition altered the structure of soybean 11S/7S protein gels. Low Ca2+ levels increased the turbidity, hardness, and water retention of the gels, whereas high levels disrupted the orderly aggregation of 11S/7S proteins, creating a rough, porous network. The effect of Ca2+ was more pronounced with a higher 11S ratio, significantly influencing turbidity, disulfide bonding, and gel hardness. Conversely, 7S-rich gels showed reduced sensitivity to Ca2+. In vitro digestion and SDS-PAGE results indicated that 7S globulin's α, α', and β subunits were more digestible than the A and B subunits of 11S globulin. In conclusion, ultrasound combined with Ca2+ can enhance the cross-linking degree between 11S and 7S globulin, forming a dense network structure.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: To investigate the effect of a fermented soy supplement during 18 months in patients under active surveillance (AS) for low-risk and selected favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), with an emphasis on PSA modulation. Methods: Low-risk patients with ISUP grade 1, clinical stage cT1 or cT2a, PSA < 10 ng/mL and favorable intermediate-risk patients with ISUP grade 2 (<10% pattern 4), clinical stage T2b-c, PSA 10-20 ng/mL. The primary outcome was PSA response defined as maximum PSA rise less than or equal to 0.87 ng/mL after 1 year, based on the weighted average of PSA velocity (PSAV) in previous studies in similar populations. Secondary outcomes were disease progression, adverse histology on repeat biopsy or switch to active therapy. In addition, primary and secondary outcomes with imputed data were also determined as sensitivity analyses, using Mann-Whitney U or Chi-squared tests. Results: Overall, 92 (61.3%) of 150 patients showed a PSA level response. This was more evident in ISUP 1 patients and resulted in fewer follow-up MRIs and fewer control biopsies, as well as a fewer number of positive control biopsies with statistical significance in the imputed dataset. Obtaining a PSA response was numerically associated with less initiated therapy. Conclusions: a fermented soy supplement in patients under AS for low-risk and selected favorable intermediate-risk PCa could be useful in selecting patients who may remain under AS or who may need to switch to active therapy."

      "abstract": "Severe cutaneous injuries may not heal spontaneously and may necessitate the use of supplementary therapeutic methods. Electrospun nanofibers possess high porosity and specific surface area, which provide the necessary microenvironment for wound healing. Here in, the nanofibers of Soluplus-soy protein isolate (Sol-SPI) containing mupirocin (Mp) were fabricated via electrospinning for wound treatment. The fabricated nanofibers exhibited water absorption capacities of about 300.83 ± 29.72% and water vapor permeability values of about 821.8 ± 49.12 g/m2 day. The Sol/SPI/Mp nanofibers showed an in vitro degradability of 33.73 ± 3.55% after 5 days. The ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus, and elongation of the Sol/SPI/Mp nanofibers were measured as 3.61 ± 0.29 MPa, 39.15 ± 5.08 MPa, and 59.11 ± 1.94%, respectively. Additionally, 85.90 ± 6.02% of Mp loaded in the nanofibers was released in 5 days in vitro, and by applying the Mp-loaded nanofibers, 93.06 ± 5.40% and 90.40 ± 5.66% of S. aureus and E. coli bacteria were killed, respectively. Human keratinocyte cells (HaCat) demonstrated notable biocompatibility with the prepared nanofibers. Furthermore, compare to other groups, Sol-SPI-Mp nanofibers caused the fastest re-epithelialization and wound healing in a rat model. The findings of this study present a novel nanofiber-based wound dressing that accelerates the healing of severe skin wounds with the risk of infection.",

In this study, we investigated whether skeletal muscle PGC1α, a transcriptional activator known to promote a variety of exercise-related metabolic processes, is involved in the anti-obesity effects of soy isoflavones using skeletal muscle-specific PGC1α knockout mice. The results showed that the intake of soy isoflavones reduced white adipose tissue weight and increased expression of energy metabolism-related genes such as mitochondrial function, lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. However, these effects were not observed in skeletal muscle-specific PGC1α knockout mice. In C2C12 myoblasts with overexpressing PGC1α, soy isoflavone treatment increased energy-metabolism related genes. Therefore, PGC1α of skeletal muscle is likely to be involved in the anti-obesity effects of soy isoflavones.",

A total of 180 crossbred pigs (Duroc × Landrace × Large White [64.4 ± 1.95]) were randomly allocated five dietary treatments based on body weight (BW) and sex in a 30 d trial. Pigs were fed five diets: (i) fresh soy oil + inorganic trace minerals (ITMs) + inorganic selenium (FISI), (ii) oxidized soy oil + ITMs + inorganic selenium (OISI), (iii) fresh soy oil + ITMs + selenium yeast (FISY), (iv) oxidized soy oil + ITMs + selenium yeast (OISY), and (v) oxidized soy oil + organic trace minerals (OTMs) + selenium yeast (OOSY). Each dietary treatment included six replicates and six pigs per replicate (three barrows and three gilts). Feeding OISI resulted in lower average daily gain (ADG) and dressing percentage (p < 0.05). The OOSY group had a higher dressing percentage and activities of serum CAT and GSH-Px in growing-finishing pigs (p < 0.05). In addition, the relative abundance of Campylobacterota in the colonic digesta varied with the quality of soy oil and source of trace minerals (p < 0.05), but no significant differences in short-chain fatty acid concentrations were observed among all dietary groups. In conclusion, adding oxidized soy oil to the diet negatively impacted the ADG and dressing percentage of growing-finishing pigs, and replacing ITMs with OTMs and SY alleviated these negative impacts. A combination of OTMs and SY can support antioxidant capacity to mitigate the negative impacts of oxidized oil on the growth performance and dressing percentage of growing-finishing pigs."

Specifically, the SPI solution was acidified to pH 2.5 using hydrochloric acid (HA), acetic acid (AA), tartaric acid (TA) and citric acid (CA), respectively, and then heated at 85 °C. It was found that the SPI gel with the anisotropic structure was formed, which suggested that the gel resulted from the organized arrangement of the SPI fibril. Subsequently, it was confirmed by several techniques such as atomic force microscopy that the above acidic-thermal treatment induced fibrillation of SPI. Furthermore, the ability of these acids to promote gelation and fibrillation of SPI was in the order of CA > TA > HA > AA. In summary, these results suggested that heating at pH 2.5 resulted in SPI fibrillation, thus promoting SPI gelation, and the acidity regulator type had a profound effect.",

Typically, whiter-colored SPIs were more favorite. However, products currently manufactured in the industry predominantly exhibit a yellowish hue. In our study, the incorporation of gaseous ozone into the production process of SPI notably improved its appearance on color. Simultaneously, a reduction in the isoflavone content enriched in SPI due to ozone treatment was observed, suggesting a potential mechanism for improving the whiteness of SPI. In addition, we discovered that the introduction of ozone for different times oxidized ozone-sensitive sulfhydryl groups, tryptophan, and tyrosine in proteins, thereby affecting the protein structure. This finding was determined through the analysis of free sulfhydryl groups, disulfide bonds, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, FTIR, and endogenous fluorescence spectroscopy of SPIs. Meanwhile, the ozone treatment did not induce protein aggregation or alter its functional properties.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the osteogenic activity and mechanism of soybean peptide VVELLKAFEEKF (SOP) and the potential relationship between SOP and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). The results show that SOP promotes MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation by altering cell progression. SOP induced cell differentiation and mineralization in a dose-dependent manner at 0.7-7 μM. Moreover, SOP stimulates osteoblast differentiation, which may be achieved through the activation of p38-MAPK and Smad2/3 signaling pathways. Furthermore, treatment with a TβRI inhibitor (SB525334) inhibited the phosphorylation levels of p38 and Smad2/3, which indicates the involvement of TβRI in the process of osteoblast differentiation caused by SOP. Besides, in non-FBS-cultured MC3T3-E1 cells, SOP and TGF-β1 promoted the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, but the effect was lost when SOP was incubated separately, indicating that SOP stimulated osteoblast differentiation by promoting TGF-β1 activity. In vivo, SOP significantly restores bone mineral density loss and behavioral deficits in a model of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) in zebrafish. These results suggest that SOP may have the function of promoting bone remodeling and may be used as a potential active factor for functional food development to prevent osteoporosis.",

In the study, 816 one-day-old Ross 308 male broiler chickens were divided into a 2 × 2 factorial arrangements consisting of four treatment groups with 12 replicates (17 birds/replicate) based on diets with high nutrient density (HND) or low nutrient density (LND) from d 0 to 42 and receiving either control or 1% SDP diets during d 0 to 10. The results showed that feed intake (FI) and body weight gain (BWG) were increased (P < 0.05) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly reduced (P = 0.003) for broilers fed HND diets from d 0 to 42. The inclusion of SDP increased the BWG (P < 0.001), FI (P < 0.001), and FCR (P < 0.05) during d 0 to 10 of broiler life but not effect of SDP was observed for the whole 0-42 d period. Carcass yield increased with HND (P < 0.001) and dietary SDP (P = 0.002). However, HND feeding significantly decreased liver (P < 0.001), bursa of Fabricius (P = 0.002), abdominal fat (P < 0.001), proventriculus (P < 0.001) and gizzard weight (P < 0.001), but increased heart weight (P = 0.013), although spleen weight remained unaffected (P > 0.05) on d 42. Tibial bone morphometric and mechanical properties improved (P < 0.05) with SDP supplementation, and bone ash, Ca, and P remained unaffected (P > 0.05) on d 14. With the exception at d 28 (P = 0.037), the antibody titer to ND virus was similar among all treatment groups (P > 0.05) at d 0, 14, and 42. In conclusion, HND diets improve performance of broilers during the whole period and SDP supplementation during starter phase improve performance at this period, but also increased carcass yield, and tibial quality. Therefore, inclusion of SDP in the starter diet could be a beneficial nutritional strategy to improve the health and production of broilers provided feeding strategies using various nutrient densities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Encapsulation of bioactive compounds within protein-based nanoparticles has garnered considerable attention in the food and pharmaceutical industries because of its potential to enhance stability and delivery. Soy protein isolate (SPI) has emerged as a promising candidate, prompting the present study aiming to modify its properties through controlled thermal and trypsin treatments for improved encapsulation efficiency (EE) of lutein and its storage stability. RESULTS: The EE of lutein nanoparticles encapsulated using SPI trypsin hydrolysates (SPIT) with three varying degrees of hydrolysis (4.11%, 6.91% and 10.61% for SPIT1, SPIT2 and SPIT3, respectively) increased by 12.00%, 15.78% and 18.59%, respectively, compared to SPI. Additionally, the photostability of SPIT2 showed a remarkable increase of 38.21% compared to SPI. The superior encapsulation efficiency and photostability of SPIT2 was attributed to increased exposure of hydrophobic groups, excellent antioxidant activity and uniform particle stability, despite exhibiting lower binding affinity to lutein compared to SPI. Furthermore, in SPIT2, the protein structure unfolded, with minimal impact on overall secondary structure upon lutein addition. CONCLUSION: The precise application of controlled thermal and trypsin treatments to SPI has been shown to effectively produce protein nanoparticles with substantially improved encapsulation efficiency for lutein and enhanced storage stability of the encapsulated lutein. These findings underscore the potential of controlled thermal and trypsin treatments to modify protein properties effectively and offer significant opportunities for expanding the applications of protein-based formulations across diverse fields. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Mice were provided with HS solution (2% NaCl in drinking water) with or without LPC70 for 12 weeks. Blood pressure, cognitive function, and inflammatory response of intestine were determined. Hypertension and impaired object recognition memory induced by HS intake were implicated with increased inducible nitric oxide synthase in the small intestine and tau hyperphosphorylation in the prefrontal cortex.

      "abstract": "Urethanase is a promising biocatalyst for degrading carcinogen ethyl carbamate (EC) in fermented foods. However, their vulnerability to high ethanol and/or salt and acidic conditions severely limits their applications. In this study, a novel urethanase from Alicyclobacillus pomorum (ApUH) was successfully discovered using a database search. ApUH shares 49.4% sequence identity with the reported amino acid sequences. It belongs to the Amidase Signature family and has a conserved \"K-S-S\" catalytic triad and the characteristic \"GGSS\" motif. The purified enzyme overexpressed in Escherichia coli exhibits a high EC affinity (Km, 0.306 mM) and broad pH tolerance (pH 4.0-9.0), with an optimum pH 7.0. Enzyme activity remained at 58% in 12% (w/v) NaCl, and 80% in 10% (v/v) ethanol or after 1 h treatment with the same ethanol solution at 37 °C. ApUH has no hydrolytic activity toward urea. Under 30 °C, the purified enzyme (200 U/L) degraded about 15.4 and 43.1% of the EC in soy sauce samples (pH 5.0, 6.0), respectively, in 5 h. Furthermore, the enzyme also showed high activity toward the class 2A carcinogen acrylamide in foods. These attractive properties indicate their potential applications in the food industry.",

      "abstract": "Soy proteins are seen as a promising alternative food source for meat with environmentally friendly properties. The problem is that the functional properties of soy proteins do not meet the needs of the food industry, and some existing modification technologies have adverse effects. Recently, cavitation jet technology (CJT) has been studied because it generates high heat, high pressure, strong shear and strong shock waves. This review summarizes the history and mechanism of cavitation jets. The energy generated during the cavitation jet process can open molecular structures, and the shock waves and microjets generated can pulverize the materials by erosion. The impact of the CJT on the morphology, structure, and functionality of soy proteins is discussed. The impact of combining CJT with other techniques on the production of soy proteins was also reviewed. The modification of proteins using two or more methods with complementary strengths, avoiding the disadvantages of certain techniques, makes the modification of proteins more effective. One of the most prominent effects is the combined treatment of cavitation jets with physical techniques. Finally, the review provides a comprehensive analysis of the application of modified soy proteins in the food industry and highlights promising avenues for future research.",

The results found that 10% SPI could inhibit the growth of ice crystals, improve the water distribution, enhance the water holding capacity of the gels, and strengthen the interaction between surimi and proteins. Compared to the control group, the composite silver carp surimi gel exhibited superior quality in texture, chemical interactions, and rheological properties during cold storage. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed an increasing trend in α-helix and β-turn content and a decreasing trend of β-sheet and random coil content. As storage time increased, the gel deterioration during cold storage inhibitory effect of the treatment group was superior to the control group, with the best results observed at -40 °C storage conditions. Overall, SPI was a good choice for maintaining the quality of silver carp surimi gel during cold storage, which could significantly reduce the changes in the textural properties during cold storage with improved water holding capacity."

The results of rehydration, including wettability and dispersibility, indicated that ultrasound (200 W)-assisted SL (5 g/L) addition had the shortest wetting time and dispersion time, which were 307.14 ± 7.00 s and 20.95 ± 2.27 s, respectively. In terms of powder properties, the EWPP with added SL had lower lightness, moisture content and bulk density. In addition, the increase in average particle size, net negative charge, free sulfhydryl group content and surface hydrophobicity indicated that ultrasound treatment facilitated the protein structures unfolding and promoted the formation of SL-EWP complexes. Overall, our study provided a new perspective for the food industry regarding using ultrasound technology to produce instant EWPP with higher biological activity and more complete nutritional value."

The effects of CNE-SPI/COS on the oxidation and aggregation of myofibrillar protein (MPs) from sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) were investigated. Samples were immersed in sterile water (CK), SPI/COS solution and CNE-SPI/COS solution, respectively, follow by a 15-day refrigerated storage. MPs were extracted from fish fillets at 3-day intervals, then assessed for the oxidation degree and conformational changes in MPs, as well as structural variations in myofibrils. Compared with the CK group, the results obtained from protein oxidation assessment clarified that the oxidation and aggregation of MPs was significantly reduced by the CNE-SPI/COS treatment, as evidenced by the higher total sulfhydryl content and Ca2+-ATPase activity and lower surface hydrophobicity. Conformational analysis of MPs showed that CNE-SPI/COS was effective in maintaining the ordered secondary structure of MPs and reducing the exposure of hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic core of the tertiary structure. In addition, CNE-SPI/COS was found to be effective in protecting the microstructure of muscle fibers and myofibrils in fish fillets. These results suggest that CNE-SPI/COS can be a promising method to prevent protein oxidation and aggregation in fish.",

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of broccoli extract (BE) alone and in combination with soy isoflavones (SI) on endometrial implants in female rat. METHODS: In this study, endometriosis was induced surgically in 40 mature female rats. The rats were divided into 5 groups that were treated by oral gavage for 6 weeks with 0.5 mL of saline 0.9 %/day (control group), BE (3,000 mg/kg/day), SI (50 mg/kg/day), BE/soy isoflavones (BE 3000 mg/kg/day + soy isoflavones 50 mg/kg/day) and diphereline as a standard medication (3 mg/kg) intramuscularly. At the end of treatments, the volume and histopathology of the endometrial implants were compared among the 5 groups. The serum levels of oxidative parameters including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were also compared between the groups. The volume of the implants significantly decreased in diphereline group (p=0.002). RESULTS: The histopathological grade of endometrial implants in BE/SI and diphereline group were significantly decreased compared to the control group (p=0.001). The serum levels of SOD in BE group were enhanced significantly in comparison to the control group (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: BE in combination with SI decreased the growth and histopathologic grades of transplanted endometrial implants. These herbal compounds may have the potential therapeutic effect to be used as an alternative medication for the treatment of endometriosis."

Under the optimal conditions (20 % inoculum, pH 7 and stirring at 100 rpm), the multiple starter culture generated 128.69 mg/L of GABA after 7 days and produced 239.08 mg/L of GABA after 4 weeks of fermentation, which is 36 % higher than under non-optimized conditions (153.48 mg/L). Furthermore, sensory analysis revealed high consumer acceptance of the fermented soy sauce than the control (soy sauce without any treatment and additional bacteria) and commercial soy sauce. Consumers indicated that the starter culture offered an improved umami taste and reduced bitter, sour and salty flavours compared to the commercial product. Under optimal fermentation conditions determined by RSM statistical analysis, the multiple starter culture is able to produce high levels of GABA and is more likely to be accepted by consumers. The findings of this research have the potential to impact the food sector by offering a functional soy sauce with added health benefits and also being well-received by consumers."

METHODS: A 12-week single-center randomized controlled trial with a control-group and open-label design was conducted. Eighty-four older adults from a long-term care facility participated in the study. The chefs at the facility cooked three meals using soy protein-rich recipes designed by dieticians. For 12 weeks, the intervention group participants consumed three meals with 30 g of soy protein (10 g/meal) per day, and the control group participants maintained their habitual diets. RESULTS: The 84 participants (mean age, 84.9 ± 7.0 years; 61.9% female) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (43 participants) and a control group (41 participants). The intervention group exhibited significant increases in several lean mass indicators, namely soft lean mass (mean, 1.43 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-1.65 kg), skeletal muscle mass (mean, 1.20 kg; 95% CI: 0.43-1.96 kg), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (mean, 0.79 kg; 95% CI: 0.07-1.52 kg), and skeletal muscle index (mean, 0.37 kg/m2; 95% CI: 0.05-0.68 kg/m2) (all P < 0.05). These changes were not observed in the control group (all P > 0.05). Notably, calf circumference decreased significantly in the control group (mean, -0.98 cm; 95% CI: -1.61 to -0.36 cm) but was maintained in the intervention group. The differences in the calf circumference and 6-m walk performance of the two groups were significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week soy protein-rich meal intervention improved the muscle mass and 6-m walk performance of older adults in a long-term care facility.",

It was revealed that MC improved the strength of SPI gels through its thickening properties, but it could not inhibit the reduction of SPI gels after freezing. The 0.4% MC-SPI gel exhibited the best gel strength (193.2 ± 2.4 g). SHMP inhibited gel reduction during freezing through hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions; it enhanced the freezing stability of SPI gels. The addition of 0.15% SHMP made the water-holding capacity in SPI gels reach the highest score after freezing (58.2 ± 0.32%). The synergistic effect of MC and SHMP could improve the strength and the freezing stability of SPI gels. MC facilitated the release of ionizable groups within SPI, causing negatively charged SHMP groups to aggregate on the SPI and inhibit the freezing aggregation of proteins. These results provide a strong basis for the improvement of cryogenic soy protein gel performance by SHMP and MC."

However, the strength of such soy films needed improvement because they were weak. The purpose of this study was to investigate how transglutaminase (TG) cross-linking reactions and film enhancers, including pectin (low- and high-methoxyl pectin), whey protein isolate (WPI), and soy protein isolate (SPI), improve the physical properties of soy films. Soy films prepared with TG had tensile strength (TS) of 3.01 MPa and puncture strength (PS) of 0.78 MPa, which were higher by as much as 51% and 30% than that of soy films without TG treatment, respectively. Pectin showed significant effects on the mechanical properties of TG-added soy films in terms of TS, PS, and % elongation. On the other hand, only TS and PS were increased by the addition of WPI or SPI. Heat curing had a significant effect on soy film's physical properties. TG treatment significantly reduced film solubility when soaked in water and various levels of acid (vinegar) and base (baking soda) solutions. Under the experimental conditions of 35 unit TG and 28 min of reaction, the degrees of cross-linking were evidenced by the disappearance of individual protein subunits, except the basic subunit of glycinin, and the reduction of 21% of lysine residues of the proteins. HIGHLIGHTS: Edible soy films were made with transglutaminase and about 21% lysine cross-linked. The mechanical strength of soy films was increased by incorporating film enhancers. Transglutaminase enhanced the mechanical properties of soy films.",

This was mainly attributed to the synergistic interactions within the algae-fungi (Apiotrichum)-bacteria (Acinetobacter and Rhizobia) consortium, which effectively assimilated certain extracellular polymeric substances into biomass to enhance algal biofilm growth. Increased algal productivity notably improved protein and essential amino acid contents in the biomass, suggesting a potential for animal feed applications.

      "abstract": "Breast cancer presents a significant global health challenge with rising incidence rates worldwide. Despite current efforts, it remains inadequately controlled. Functional foods, notably tempeh, have emerged as promising candidates for breast cancer prevention and treatment due to bioactive peptides and isoflavones exhibiting potential anticancer properties by serving as antioxidants, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. This study integrates pharmacoinformatics and cellular investigations (i.e., a multifaceted approach) to elucidate the antioxidative and anti-breast cancer properties of tempeh-derived isoflavones. Methodologies encompass metabolomic profiling, in silico analysis, antioxidant assays, and in vitro experiments. Daidzein and genistein exhibited potential therapeutic options for breast cancer treatment and as antioxidant agents. In vitro studies also supported their efficacy against breast cancer and their ability to scavenge radicals, particularly in soy-based tempeh powder (SBT-P) and its isoflavone derivatives. Results have demonstrated a significant downregulation of breast cancer signaling proteins and increased expression of miR-7-5p, a microRNA with tumor-suppressive properties. Notably, the LD50 values of SBT-P and its derivatives on normal breast cell lines indicate their potential safety, with minimal cytotoxic effects on MCF-10A cells compared to control groups. The study underscores the favorable potential of SBT-P as a safe therapeutic option for breast cancer treatment, warranting further clinical exploration."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of different preheat treatments on the emulsifying and gel textural properties of soy protein with varying 11S/7S ratios. A mixture of 7S and 11S globulins, obtained from defatted soybean meal, was prepared at different ratios. The mixed proteins were subjected to preheating (75 °C, 85 °C, and 95 °C for 5 min) or non-preheating, followed by spray drying or non-spray drying. The solubility of protein mixtures rich in the 7S fraction tended to decrease significantly after heating at 85 °C, while protein mixtures rich in the 11S fraction showed a significant decrease after heating at 95 °C. Surprisingly, the emulsion stability index (ESI) of protein mixtures rich in the 7S fraction significantly improved twofold during processing at 75 °C. This study revealed a negative correlation between the emulsifying ability of soy protein and the 11S/7S ratio. For protein mixtures rich in either the 7S or the 11S fractions, gelling proprieties as well as emulsion activity index (EAI) and ESI showed no significant changes after spray drying; however, surface hydrophobicity was significantly enhanced following heating at 85 °C post-spray drying treatment. These findings provide insights into the alterations in gelling and emulsifying properties during various heating processes, offering great potential for producing soy protein ingredients with enhanced emulsifying ability and gelling property. They also contribute to establishing a theoretical basis for the standardized production of soy protein isolate with specific functional characteristics."

      "abstract": "The low rehydration properties of commercial soy protein powder (SPI), a major plant-based food ingredient, have limited the development of plant-based foods. The present study proposes a treatment of soy lecithin modification combined with Alcalase hydrolysis to improve the rehydration of soy protein powder, as well as other processing properties (emulsification, viscosity). The results show that the soy protein-soy lecithin complex powder, which is hydrolyzed for 30 min (SPH-SL-30), has the smallest particle size, the smallest zeta potential, the highest surface hydrophobicity, and a uniform microstructure. In addition, the value of the ratio of the α-helical structure/β-folded structure was the smallest in the SPH-SL-30. After measuring the rehydration properties, emulsification properties, and viscosity, it was found that the SPH-SL-30 has the shortest wetting time of 3.04 min, the shortest dispersion time of 12.29 s, the highest solubility of 93.17%, the highest emulsifying activity of 32.42 m2/g, the highest emulsifying stability of 98.33 min, and the lowest viscosity of 0.98 pa.s. This indicates that the treatment of soy lecithin modification combined with Alcalase hydrolysis destroys the structure of soy protein, changes its physicochemical properties, and improves its functional properties. In this study, soy protein was modified by the treatment of soy lecithin modification combined with Alcalase hydrolysis to improve the processing characteristics of soy protein powders and to provide a theoretical basis for its high-value utilization in the plant-based food field."

However, heat-induced protein aggregation and gelation significantly hinders the production of high-protein drinks. In this study, oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions with exceptional thermal stability were formulated using modified soy protein particles (MSPs). These MSPs effectively resisted gel formation, even at a protein concentration of up to 20% (w/v). In contrast, emulsions prepared with untreated soy proteins (SPs) experienced pronounced gelation under identical conditions. The compact structure of MSPs, in comparison to SPs, imparted resistance to heat-induced denaturation and aggregation. Additionally, the emulsion displayed heightened heat processing insensitivity, due to the enhanced hydrophobicity of MSPs and their rapid adsorption at the oil-water interface, resulting in a denser, more elastic, and resilient interfacial film. These findings provide practical insights for the formulation of protein-rich milk alternatives, meeting the evolving market demands.",

      "abstract": "A special technique has been developed for producing a composite aerogel which consists of graphene oxide and soy wax (GO/wax). The reduction of graphene oxide was carried out by the stepwise heating of this aerogel to 250 °C. The aerogel obtained in the process of the stepwise thermal treatment of rGO/wax was studied by IR and Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetry. The heat treatment led to an increase in the wax fraction accompanied by an increase in the contact angle of the rGO/wax aerogel surface from 136.2 °C to 142.4 °C. The SEM analysis has shown that the spatial structure of the aerogel was formed by sheets of graphene oxide, while the wax formed rather large (200-1000 nm) clumps in the folds of graphene oxide sheets and small (several nm) deposits on the flat surface of the sheets. The sorption properties of the rGO/wax aerogel were studied with respect to eight solvent, oil, and petroleum products, and it was found that dichlorobenzene (85.8 g/g) and hexane (41.9 g/g) had the maximum and minimum sorption capacities, respectively. In the case of oil and petroleum products, the indicators were in the range of 52-63 g/g. The rGO/wax aerogel was found to be highly resistant to sorption-desorption cycles. The cyclic tests also revealed a swelling effect that occurred differently for different parts of the aerogel."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Food allergies are a growing concern worldwide, with soy proteins being important allergens that are widely used in various food products. This study investigated the potential of transglutaminase (TGase) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) treatments to modify the allergenicity and structural properties of soy protein isolate (SPI), aiming to develop safer soy-based food products. RESULTS: Treatment with TGase, LAB or their combination significantly reduced the antibody reactivity of β-conglycinin and the immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding capacity of soy protein, indicating a decrease in allergenicity. TGase treatment led to the formation of high-molecular-weight aggregates, suggesting protein crosslinking, while LAB treatment resulted in partial protein hydrolysis. These structural changes were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, which showed a decrease in β-sheet content and an increase in random coil and β-turn contents. In addition, changes in intrinsic fluorescence and ultraviolet spectroscopy were also observed. The alterations in protein interaction and the reduction in free sulfhydryl groups highlighted the extensive structural modifications induced by these treatments. CONCLUSION: The synergistic application of TGase and LAB treatments effectively reduced the allergenicity of SPI through significant structural modifications. This approach not only diminished antibody reactivity of β-conglycinin and IgE binding capacity of soy protein but also altered the protein's primary, secondary and tertiary structures, suggesting a comprehensive alteration of SPI's allergenic potential. These findings provide a promising strategy for mitigating food allergy concerns and lay the foundation for future research on food-processing techniques aimed at allergen reduction. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "In spite of recent advances in the field of undernutrition, current dietary therapy relying on the supply of high protein high calorie formulas is still plagued with transient recovery of impaired organs resulting in significant relapse of cases. This is partly attributed to the inadequacy of current research models in recapitulating clinical undernutrition for mechanistic exploration. Using 1636 Macaca fascicularis monkeys, a human-relevant criterion for determining undernutrition weight-for-age z-score (WAZ), with a cutoff point of ≤ -1.83 is established as the benchmark for identifying undernourished nonhuman primates (U-NHPs). In U-NHPs, pathological anomalies in multi-organs are revealed. In particular, severe dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism characterized by impaired fatty acid oxidation due to mitochondria dysfunction, but unlikely peroxisome disorder, is identified as the anchor metabolic aberration in U-NHPs. Mitochondria dysfunction is typified by reduced mito-number, accumulated long-chain fatty acids, and disruption of OXPHOS complexes. Soy peptide-treated U-NHPs increase in WAZ scores, in addition to attenuated mitochondria dysfunction and restored OXPHOS complex levels. Herein, innovative criteria for identifying U-NHPs are developed, and unknown molecular mechanisms of undernutrition are revealed hitherto, and it is further proved that soypeptide supplementation reprogramed mitochondrial function to re-establish lipid metabolism balance and mitigated undernutrition.",

Thus, finding vehicles that enhance bioavailability, enable controlled release, and mitigate adverse effects is crucial. The study focuses on encapsulating 5-FU within soy lecithin vesicles (SLVs) and assessing its impact on the carrier's properties and functionality. Results show that incorporating 5-FU does not affect SLVs' size or polydispersity, even postlyophilization. Liberation of 5-FU from SLVs requires system disruption rather than spontaneous release, with an encapsulation efficiency of approximately 43% determined using Square Wave Voltammetry. Cytotoxicity assays on colorectal cancer cells reveal SLV-based delivery's significant efficacy, surpassing free drug solution effects with 45% cell viability after 72 h vs 73% viability. The research addresses 5-FU's limited bioavailability by creating a biocompatible nanocarrier for efficient drug delivery, highlighting SLVs as promising for targeted cancer therapy due to sustained antiproliferative effects and improved cellular uptake. The study underscores the importance of tailored drug delivery systems in enhancing therapeutic outcomes and suggests SLV/5-FU formulations as a potential advancement in cancer treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of ultrasonic treatment at different powers on the physicochemical properties, microstructure and quercetin delivery capacity of fermentation-induced soy protein isolate emulsion gel (FSEG). The FSEG was prepared by subjecting soy protein isolate (SPI) emulsion to ultrasonic treatment at various powers (0, 100, 200, 300, and 400 W), followed by lactic acid bacteria fermentation. Compared with the control group (0 W), the FSEG treated with ultrasound had higher hardness, water holding capacity (WHC) and rheological parameters. Particularly, at an ultrasonic power of 300 W, the FSEG had the highest hardness (101.69 ± 4.67 g) and WHC (75.20 ± 1.07%) (p < 0.05). Analysis of frequency sweep and strain scanning revealed that the storage modulus (G') and yield strains of FSEG increased after 300 W ultrasonic treatment. Additionally, the recovery rate after creep recovery test significantly increased from 18.70 ± 0.49% (0 W) to 58.05 ± 0.54% (300 W) (p < 0.05). Ultrasound treatment also resulted in an increased β-sheet content and the formation of a more compact micro-network structure. This led to a more uniform distribution of oil droplets and reduced mobility of water within the gel. Moreover, ultrasonic treatment significantly enhanced the encapsulation efficiency of quercetin in FSEG from 81.25 ± 0.62 % (0 W) to 90.04 ± 1.54% (300 W). The bioaccessibility of quercetin also increased significantly from 28.90 ± 0.40% (0 W) to 42.58 ± 1.60% (300 W) (p < 0.05).

While some recent research has suggested that soy has a positive impact on serum adiponectin levels, the results are inconsistent. Therefore, we aim to conduct a thorough systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigate the effects of soy on serum adiponectin levels in adults. The search was conducted until March 2024 on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases to identify RCTs that studied the effects of soy supplementation on serum adiponectin levels. A random-effects model was used to pool the weighted mean differences (WMDs). Ten and nine RCTs were selected for the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. After analyzing data from 9 eligible RCTs, it was found that soy supplementation did not significantly impact the concentrations of adiponectin (WMD = -0.24 μg/mL; 95% confidence interval, -1.56 to 1.09; p = 0.72). However, there was significant heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 89.8%, p < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed that overall estimates were not affected by the elimination of any study. We did not observe any evidence regarding publication bias. In conclusion, soy supplementation did not have a significant effect on adiponectin levels in adults. However, further RCTs are needed with longer intervention duration, higher doses, and studies conducted in different countries."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of soy isoflavones supplementation on metabolic status in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 50 patients with NAFLD were randomly allocated to either soy isoflavone or placebo groups for 12 weeks. The soy isoflavone group took 100 mg/d soy isoflavone and the placebo group took the similar tablets containing starch. Anthropometric indices, blood lipids, glycemic parameters and blood pressure were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. RESULTS: At the end of week 12 the level of serum triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol (TC) was significantly decreased only in soy isoflavone group compared to baseline (P < 0.05). Although waist circumference (WC) decreased significantly in both groups after 12 weeks of intervention (P < 0.05), hip circumference (HC) decreased significantly only in soy isoflavone group (P = 0.001). No significant changes observed regarding high density lipoprotein (HDL) and blood pressure in both groups. At the end of the study, serum glucose level was significantly decreased in the placebo group compared to baseline (P = 0.047). No significant changes demonstrated in the soy isoflavone group in regard to glycemic parameters (P > 0.05).

This study investigated the differential impact of heating modes on the immunogenic potential of peptides in soy protein digests. Wet or dry heating was applied, followed by in vitro gastrointestinal infant digestion. The released peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Bioinformatics tools were utilized to predict and identify potential linear B-cell and T-cell epitopes, as well as to explore cross-reactivity with other legumes. Subsequently, the peptide intensities of the same potential epitope across different experimental conditions were compared. As a result, we confirmed the previously observed enhancing effect of wet heating on infant digestion and inhibitory effect of dry heating. A total of 8,546 peptides were detected in the digests, and 6,684 peptides were with a score over 80. Among them, 29 potential T-cell epitopes and 27 potential B-cell epitopes were predicted. Cross-reactivity between soy and other legumes, including peanut, pea, chickpea, lentil, kidney bean, and lupine, was also detected. Overall, heating and digestion time could modulate the potential to trigger peptide-induced immune responses.",

      "abstract": "High-moisture extrusion (HME) is widely used to produce meat analogues. During HME the plant-based materials experience thermal and mechanical stresses. It is complicated to separate their effects on the final products because these effects are interrelated. In this study we hypothesize that the intensity of the thermal treatment can explain a large part of the physicochemical changes that occur during extrusion. For this reason, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was used as a novel method to quantify the thermal process intensity during HME. High-temperature shear cell (HTSC) processing was used to create a partial least squares (PLS) regression curve for processing temperature under controlled processing conditions (root mean standard error of cross-validation (RMSECV) = 4.00 °C, coefficient of determination of cross-validation (R2CV) = 0.97). This PLS regression model was then applied to HME extrudates produced at different screw speeds (200-1200 rpm) and barrel temperatures (100-160 °C) with two different screw profiles to calculate the equivalent shear cell temperature as a measure for thermal process intensity. This equivalent shear cell temperature reflects the effects of changes in local temperature conditions, residence time and thermal stresses. Furthermore, it can be related to the degree of texturization of the extrudates. This information can be used to gain new insights into the effect of various process parameters during HME on the thermal process intensity and extrudate quality.",

      "abstract": "The gut plays a crucial role in the development and progression of metabolic disorders, particularly in relation to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While a high intake of dietary fiber is inversely associated with the risk of T2DM, the specific effects of various dietary fibers on T2DM are not fully understood. This study investigated the anti-diabetic properties of fermented dietary fiber (FDF) derived from soy sauce residue in T2DM mice, demonstrating its ability to lower blood glucose levels and ameliorate insulin resistance. Our findings revealed that FDF could enhance hepatic glucose metabolism via the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Additionally, the anti-diabetic effect of FDF was correlated with alterations in gut microbiota composition in T2DM mice, promoting a healthier gut environment. Specifically, FDF increased the abundance of beneficial flora such as Dubosiella, Butyricimonas, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Lactobacillus and Osillibacter, while reducing harmful bacteria including Bilophila, Parabacteroides and Enterorhabdus. Further analysis of microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BAs), provided evidence of FDF's regulatory effects on cecal contents in T2DM mice. Importantly, FDF treatment significantly restored the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) expression in the colon of T2DM mice. In conclusion, our study suggests that the anti-diabetic effects of FDF are associated with the regulation of both the liver-gut axis and the gut microbiota-SCFAs-GPRs axis.",

We evaluated the effect of a fermented soy beverage (Q-Can®), containing medium-chain triglycerides, ketones and soy isoflavones, among men with localized PCa prior to radical prostatectomy. METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial of Q-Can®. Stratified randomization (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score at diagnosis) was used to assign patients to receive Q-Can® or placebo for 2-5 weeks before RP. Primary endpoint was change in serum PSA from baseline to end-of-study. We assessed changes in other clinical and pathologic endpoints. The primary ITT analysis compared PSA at end-of-study between randomization arms using repeated measures linear mixed model incorporating baseline CAPRA risk strata. RESULTS: We randomized 19 patients, 16 were eligible for analysis of the primary outcome. Mean age at enrollment was 61, 9(56.2%) were classified as low and intermediate risk, and 7(43.8%) high CAPRA risk. Among patients who received Q-Can®, mean PSA at baseline and end-of-study was 8.98(standard deviation, SD 4.07) and 8.02ng/mL(SD 3.99) compared with 8.66(SD 2.71) to 9.53ng/mL(SD 3.03), respectively, (Difference baseline - end-of-study, p = 0.36). There were no significant differences in Gleason score, clinical stage, surgical margin status, or CAPRA score between treatment arms (p > 0.05), and no significant differences between treatment arms in end-of-study or change in lipids, testosterone and FACT-P scores (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Short exposure to Q-Can® among patients with localized PCa was not associated with changes in PSA levels, PCa characteristics including grade and stage or serum testosterone. Due to early termination from inability to recruit, study power, was not achieved.",

Additionally, sodium alginate (SA) and gelatin (GEL) were added to the formulations to improve the viscoelastic properties of the inks and the effect of the SA or GEL concentrations (1, 2, and 3 wt%) was studied. All inks showed shear thinning behavior and self-supporting abilities. Among all the 3D printed scaffolds, those with higher SA (3 wt%) or GEL (2 and 3 wt%) content showed higher shape fidelity and were selected for further characterization. Texture profile analysis demonstrated that the scaffolds prepared with previously heat-treated inks containing 3 wt% GEL showed the highest strength. Additionally, these scaffolds showed a higher water-uptake capacity profile."

The main aim of this study was to investigate the potential synergy of co-culturing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and Propionibacterium freudenreichii in improving production of vitamin B12 and short-chain fatty acids in soy whey. Different strategies including mono-, sequential and simultaneous cultures were adopted. Growth, short-chain fatty acids and vitamin B12 were assessed throughout the fermentation while free amino acids, volatiles, and isoflavones were determined on the final day. P. freudenreichii monoculture grew well in soy whey, whereas B. lactis monoculture entered the death phase by day 4. Principal component analysis demonstrates that metabolic changes in both sequential cultures did not show drastic differences to those of P. freudenreichii monoculture. However, simultaneous culturing significantly improved vitamin B12, acetic acid and propionic acid contents (1.3 times, 5 times, 2.5 times, compared to the next highest treatment [sequential cultures]) in fermented soy whey relative to other culturing modes. Hence, co-culturing of P. freudenreichii and B. lactis would provide an alternative method to improve vitamin B12, acetic acid and propionic acid contents in fermented foods.",

      "abstract": "Developing an environmentally friendly soy protein-based film that offers excellent performance has garnered considerable interest while also posing a significant challenge. Herein, we propose the strategy of covalent and noncovalent cross-linking to improve the mechanical properties of the films. First, chemical denaturation was carried out under the combined action of sodium sulfite, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium hydroxide, and urea to reshape the structure of the protein to improve the solubility of protein and release active groups. Then, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) derived from low-cost agro-industrial byproducts (corn husk) was employed to balance the covalent cross-linking reaction between proteins and the noncovalent reaction between MCC and protein. The results indicate that the structure and properties of the soy protein-based films were modified and improved through chemical treatment in conjunction with biomass enhancement. It is concluded that the addition of 1% MCC improves the tensile strength, elastic modulus, water solubility, and water vapor permeability of \"MCC-1%\" by 64.7, 75.9, 22.7, and 12.9%, respectively. Additionally, the resulting film of \"MCC-1%\" exhibits better resistance to thermal degradation and improved thermo-stability. However, the elongation at break decreased by increasing the addition of MCC. Thus, this work may provide a simple and affordable approach to preparing a high-performing soy protein-based film."

Ultrasonic power significantly affected the structure of the MFGM-SL complex, further promoting the unfolding of the molecular structure of the protein, and then increased solubility and surface hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the microstructure of mimicking MFG emulsions without sonication was unevenly distributed, and the average droplet diameter was large. After ultrasonic treatment, the droplets of the emulsion were more uniformly dispersed, the particle size was smaller, and the emulsification properties and stability were improved to varying degrees. Especially when the ultrasonic power was 300 W, the mimicking MFG emulsion had the highest encapsulation rate and emulsion activity index and emulsion stability index were increased by 60.88 % and 117.74 %, respectively. From the microstructure, it was observed that the spherical droplets of the mimicking MFG emulsion after appropriate ultrasonic treatment remain well separated without obvious flocculation.

Results showed that optimal heat treatment at 70 °C improved catechin encapsulation efficiency up to 93.71 ± 0.14 %, along with the highest solubility, enhanced emulsification activity index and improved thermal stability of the protein. Multiple spectroscopic techniques revealed that increasing pretreatment temperature (from 40 °C to 70 °C) altered the secondary structures of SPI, resulting in a more stable unfolded structure for the composite system with a significant increase in α-helical structures and a decrease in random coil and β-sheet structures. Moreover, optimal heat treatment also leads to an augmentation of free sulfhydryl groups within complex as well as exposure of more internal chromophore amino acids on molecular surface. Size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography and SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the band intensity of newly formed high-molecular-weight soluble macromolecules (>180 kDa) increased as the pre-heating temperature rose. Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking analysis suggest that hydrophobic and covalent interactions were involved in complex formation, which intensified with increasing temperature.",

However, in contrast to their anticancer effects, such as cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, isoflavones have also been found to promote the growth of cancer cells. Therefore, the aim of this comprehensive review article is to present the current state of knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms by which soy-derived isoflavones target multiple cellular signalling pathways in cancer cells. Our findings indicate that soy-derived isoflavones act as, among other things, potent modulators of HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR)/SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1 (SMARCB1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), 17-β-oestradiol (E2)/oestrogen receptor-α (ERα)/neuroglobin (NGB) and sonic hedgehog signalling pathways, epigenetic modulatory agents (i.a. miR-155, miR-34a and miR-10a-5p) and cancer stem cells and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition inhibitors. The paper also discusses the latest epidemiological studies and clinical trials and provides an insight into recent extensive research on the chemo-preventive and therapeutic potential of soy-derived isoflavones.

      "abstract": "High-concentration soy protein isolate was subjected to ultrasonication for viscosity reduction to assist the process of limited enzymatic hydrolysis. Ultrasonication (20 kHz, 10 min, 160 W/L) effectively reduced the viscosity of soy protein isolate at a comparatively high concentration of 14 % (w/v) and promoted the limited enzymatic hydrolysis (controlled degree of hydrolysis of 12 %) with a higher peptide yield than that of the conventional method. The correlations between substrate viscosity and peptide yield, as well as the viscosities of the resulting hydrolysates, were studied. The findings revealed positive correlations between the viscosities of the substrate and hydrolysate, underscoring the potential impact of altering substrate viscosity on the final product. Furthermore, the utilization of ultrasonic viscosity reduction-assisted proteolysis has shown its capability to improve the functional and physicochemical properties, as well as the protein structure of the hydrolysate, while maintaining the same level of hydrolysis. It is worth noting that there were significant alterations in particle size (decrease), β-sheet content (increase), β-turn content (increase), and random coil content (increase). Interestingly, ultrasonication unexpectedly impeded the degradation of molecular mass in proteins during proteolysis, while increasing the hydrophobic properties of the hydrolysate. These findings aligned with the observed reduction in bitterness and improvement in emulsifying properties and water-holding capacity.",

High pressure treatment was applied at 200, 400 and 600 MPa for 5, 10 and 15 min. Physical properties of S-HMMA including appearance, moisture content, color and texture were analyzed during storage at 4 °C for 8 weeks. Higher pressure and longer storage time significantly reduced moisture content by creating more air cells and increasing cavitation. L* value of S-HMMA products increased at higher levels of pressurization while increasing storage time tended to decrease lightness. The unpressurized control S-HMMA product showed increasing hardness and toughness, while S-HMMA products subjected to various pressures exhibited higher hardness and toughness over time compared to the control sample at 200-400 MPa. Products treated with high pressure (600 MPa) showed the highest reductions in microbial growth but the aroma of the beans became more pronounced."

      "abstract": "Isoflavones are naturally occurring plant compounds found in uniquely high amounts in soybeans and foods made from this legume. These soybean constituents have been proposed to exert several health benefits and as such they have been the subject of an enormous amount of research. This research includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and epidemiologic investigations. Although statistically significant associations between isoflavone intake and a wide range of health outcomes have been identified in cohorts involving low-isoflavone intake populations, we suggest that these associations are unlikely to have a causal basis because exposure is too low for isoflavones to exert physiologic effects. In cohorts involving predominantly non-Asian, non-vegetarian populations, the highest isoflavone intake category is typically ≤3 mg/d, an amount of isoflavones provided by ∼30 mL (2 tablespoons) of soymilk made from whole soybeans. In comparison, mean isoflavone intake in the upper intake categories in observational studies involving high-isoflavone intake populations is typically ≥50 mg/d. In RCTs, intervention doses of isoflavones typically range between 40 and 100 mg/d. Health professionals advising patients and clients about soy food and isoflavone intake need to be aware of the limitations of epidemiologic research involving low-isoflavone intake populations. Intake recommendations are best based on the results of RCTs using clinically relevant doses of isoflavones and epidemiologic studies involving populations for whom soy foods are a habitual part of the diet.",

MATERIALS AND METHOD: This prospective observational study was carried out in a Clinical Hospital of Brasov, Romania, during June 2020 and December 2021. Eighty pre- and post-menopausal women, aged between 45 and 60 years, were included in two groups. The first group (40 women) received a dietary supplement with fermented soy extract twice a day for eight weeks and the second group (40 women) received the same dietary supplement with fermented soy extracts and 1500 mg of royal jelly capsules for eight weeks. After the treatment, the MENQOL score, DASS-21 score, and the mean number and intensity of daily hot flushes were recorded and compared with baseline values. RESULTS: After eight weeks of treatment, the score of the MENQOL questionnaire and all its domains' scores decreased in comparison with the baseline in both groups (p < 0.001). Also, the DASS-21 score (p < 0.001), depression score (p < 0.001), anxiety score (p < 0.001), and stress score (p < 0.001) improved. The mean number and the intensity of hot flushes decreased in both groups (p < 0.001). Comparing these variables after the treatment in both groups, we observed that the women who received dietary supplements with fermented soy extracts and royal jelly capsules recorded better scores for MENQOL (vasomotor, physical, and psychosocial domains) and a more reduced mean number of daily hot flushes. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study suggests that both dietary fermented soy supplements and royal jelly capsules possess beneficial effects against menopausal symptoms, increase the quality of life in pre- and post-menopausal women, and that the effects might be significantly improved if those dietary supplements are administered in association.",

Moreover, protein solubility of treated proteins exhibited significant improvements, reaching up to 59.07 % and 41.4 % for SPI and PPI, respectively, at 30 kV for 8 min. Rheological analyses indicated that storage modulus (G') was greater than loss modulus (G″) for CP-treated protein gels. Furthermore, in vitro protein digestibility of SPI exhibited a remarkable improvement (4.78 %) at 30 kV for 6 min compared to PPI (3.23 %). Spectroscopic analyses, including circular dichroism and Fourier Transform-Raman, indicated partial breakdown and loss of α-helix structure in both samples, leading to the aggregation of proteins.

      "abstract": "Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) are persistent anthropogenic chemicals that are widely distributed in the environment and pose significant risks to human health. Foam fractionation has emerged as a promising method to recover PFOS/PFOA from water. However, PFOS/PFOA concentrations in wastewater are often inadequate to generate stable foams due to their high critical micelle concentrations and the addition of a cosurfactant is necessary. In this study, we developed whey soy protein (WSP) as a green frother and collector derived from soybean meal (SBM), which is an abundant and cost-effective agro-industrial residue. WSP exhibited excellent foaming properties across a wide pH range and demonstrated strong collection capabilities that enhanced the recovery of PFOS/PFOA. The mechanism underlying this collection ability was elucidated through various methods, revealing the involvement of electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interaction, and hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, we designed a double plate internal to improve the enrichment of PFOS/PFOA by approximately 2.3 times while reducing water recovery. Under suitable conditions (WSP concentration: 300 mg/L, pH: 6.0, air flowrate: 300 mL/min), we achieved high recovery percentages of 94-98% and enrichment ratios of 7.5-12.8 for PFOS/PFOA concentrations ranging from 5 to 20 mg/L. This foam fractionation process holds great promise for the treatment of PFOS/PFOA and other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.",

Nevertheless, epidemiological studies have presented conflicting outcomes concerning the correlation between soy isoflavone consumption and blood pressure levels. Consequently, a comprehensive meta-analysis of all eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to explore the influence of soy isoflavones on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in adults. METHODS: A thorough search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for relevant literature up to April 30, 2023 was conducted. RCTs involving adults that compared soy isoflavone supplementation with a placebo (the same matrix devoid of soy isoflavone) were included. The combined effect size was presented as the weighted mean difference (WMD) along with 95% confidence interval (CI), employing a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis included a total of 24 studies involving 1945 participants. The results revealed a significant reduction in both SBP and DBP with soy isoflavone supplementation. Subgroup analyses suggested more pronounced reductions in SBP and DBP for interventions lasting ≥6 months, in individuals receiving mixed-type soy isoflavone, and among patients with metabolic syndrome or prehypertension. However, we did not detect significant nonlinear associations between supplementation dosage and intervention duration concerning both SBP and DBP. The overall quality of evidence was deemed moderate. CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis revealed that supplementation with soy isoflavones alone effectively reduces blood pressure. Additional high-quality studies are required to investigate the efficacy of blood pressure reduction through supplementation with an optimal quantity and proportion of soy isoflavone.",

The results showed that the sequence of ultrasound followed by ethanol treatment was the optimal one. The samples were subjected to ultrasonication followed by subunit disassembly and reassembly induced by 40% (v/v) ethanol, with the resulting molecular unfolding and subsequent aggregation being attributed to intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The recombined nanoparticles had smaller particle size (142.43 ± 2.91 nm) and turbidity (0.16 ± 0.01), and the exposure of more hydrophobic groups (H0 = 6221.00 ± 130.20) induced a shift of SPI structure toward a more ordered direction. The homogeneous and stable particle provided excellent stability for the loading of lutein. The bioaccessibility (from 25.48 ± 2.35 to 65.85 ± 1.78%) and release rate of lutein were modulated in gastrointestinal digestion experiments.

RESULTS: Compared with the native soy 11S globulin, the sulfhydryl content, emulsifying capacity, gel strength, water-holding capacity, and absolute zeta potential values significantly increased (P < 0.05) after LF-MF treatment. The LF-MF treatment induced the unfolding of the protein structure and the fracture of disulfide bonds. The variations in solubility, foaming properties, viscosity, surface hydrophobicity, and rheological properties were closely related to the conformational changes of soy 11S globulin, with the optimum LF-MF modification time being 90 min.

Different SPI samples with varying denaturation levels were subjected to varying annealing temperatures and durations before being stored at 37 °C for 12 weeks to assess their stability. Our findings revealed that annealing at 65 °C for 30 min significantly mitigated protein deterioration, improving the stability of highly denatured proteins during storage. Surface hydrophobicity and endogenous fluorescence analyses indicated that this annealing condition induced protein structure unfolding, an initial increase in SPI hydrophobicity, and a blue shift in the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax). The slowest increase in hydrophobicity occurred during storage, along with a red shift in the maximum absorption wavelength by the 12th week. These results suggest that annealing treatment holds promise for mitigating the issue of reduced SPI stability during storage."
