      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Black Cohosh, Soy Isoflavones, and SDG Lignans in alleviating menopausal symptoms compared to a placebo. METHODS: Ninety-six postmenopausal women aged 45-60 years were enrolled. Participants were randomized to receive either the study supplements or a placebo for 90 days, with Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) scores collected at baseline and every 4 weeks to monitor symptom changes. Secondary outcomes assessed included hormonal variations and the incidence of adverse symptoms. RESULTS: Of the initial cohort, 90 participants completed the study with high adherence. Significant improvements were observed in the treatment group across all MRS domains: somatic (- 54.3% difference, p < 0.01), psychological (- 54.3% difference, p < 0.01), urogenital (-37.3% difference, p < 0.01), and total score (- 48.0% difference, p < 0.01). Hormonal changes were modest yet statistically significant for FSH (- 6.7% difference, p < 0.01) and estradiol (12.6% difference, p < 0.01). Adverse events were minimal, transient, and did not require cessation of supplementation. CONCLUSION: Black Cohosh, Soy Isoflavones, and SDG Lignans significantly reduced menopausal symptoms with a favorable safety profile. These findings support the potential of this supplement combination as a therapeutic option for menopausal symptom management. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06328348.",

      "abstract": "Botanical dietary supplements are widely used, but issues of authenticity, consistency, safety, and efficacy that complicate their poorly understood mechanism of action have prompted questions and concerns in the popular and scientific literature. Black cohosh (Actaea racemosa L., syn. Cimicifuga racemosa, Nutt., Ranunculaceae) is a multicomponent botanical therapeutic used as a popular remedy for menopause and dysmenorrhea and explored as a treatment in breast and prostate cancer. However, its use and safety are controversial. A. racemosa tissues contain the bioactive serotonin analog N-methylserotonin, which is thought to contribute to the serotonergic activities of black cohosh-containing preparations. A. racemosa has several TDC-like genes hypothesized to encode tryptophan decarboxylases (TDCs) converting L-tryptophan to tryptamine, a direct serotonin precursor in plants. Expression of black cohosh TDC1, TDC2, and TDC3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in the production of tryptamine. TDC1 and TDC3 had approximately fourfold higher activity than TDC2, which was attributable to a variable Cys/Ser active site residue identified by site-directed mutagenesis. Co-expression in yeast of the high-activity black cohosh TDCs with the next enzyme in serotonin biosynthesis, tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H), from rice (Oryza sativa) resulted in the production of serotonin, whereas co-expression with low-activity TDCs did not, suggesting that TDC activity is a rate-limiting step in serotonin biosynthesis. Two T5H-like sequences were identified in A. racemose, but their co-expression with the high-activity TDCs in yeast did not result in serotonin production. TDC expression was detected in several black cohosh tissues, and phytochemical analysis using LC-MS revealed several new tryptamines, including tryptamine and serotonin, along with N-methylserotonin and, interestingly, N-N-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (bufotenine), which may contribute to hepatotoxicity. Incubation of A. racemosa leaves with tryptamine and N-methyltryptamine resulted in increased concentrations of serotonin and N-methylserotonin, respectively, suggesting that methylation of tryptamine precedes hydroxylation in the biosynthesis of N-methylserotonin. This work indicates a significantly greater variety of serotonin derivatives in A. racemosa than previously reported. Moreover, the activities of the TDCs underscore their key role in the production of serotonergic compounds in A. racemosa. Finally, it is proposed that tryptamine is first methylated and then hydroxylated to form the black cohosh signature compound N-methylserotonin."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Menopause is associated with a decrease in smell discrimination ability. This study assessed the impact of black cohosh on hippocampal (HC) and hypothalamic (HT) gene expression profiles in rats, to understand, if herbal treatment has an impact on neurologic changes due to menopause and whether this could address a decrease in smell discrimination. METHODS: HC and HT tissues from female Sprague Dawley rats (total n = 19) were analyzed at three different life stages: intact tissues of the HC (n = 4) and the HT (n = 4), oophorectomized tissues 3 months after oophorectomy (OVX) of the HC (n = 4) and the HT (n = 3), and tissues after treatment with an isopropanolic extract (iCR) from the rhizomes of black cohosh (60 mg/kg) for 3 months after OVX of the HC (n = 2) and the HT (n = 2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To reveal underlying biological processes a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. RESULTS: The GSEA revealed gene ontology terms that were significantly enriched, including several genes associated with the olfactory system, indicating biological processes regulated by treatment with iCR. Six olfactory receptor genes were further analyzed by another GSEA, demonstrating the possibility of iCR treatment to compensate for oophorectomy-induced changes. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that herbal treatment, such as iCR, has an esteeming impact on HC and HT genes that are changed through menopause. Further studies are needed to suggest black cohosh as a treatment option for decreased smell discrimination.",

      "abstract": "Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) is a perennial plant used to treat menopause. This plant is known to have a serotonergic rather than estrogenic impact. It has been recommended to treat vasomotor symptoms associated with breast cancer patients. It also relieves symptoms such as night sweats and hot flashes, commonly called vasorelaxation. The variability in the study's results, doses, and assessment methods requires more rigorous research to establish its efficacy and safety. Standardized trials are needed to provide more precise information on the benefits and limitations of menopause treatment, informing women seeking alternatives to hormone therapy. Black cohosh has shown the potential to reduce the frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms in breast cancer patients undergoing tamoxifen treatment. In addition to its effectiveness in alleviating night sweats and hot flashes, the vasorelaxation properties contribute to its overall positive impact on menopausal symptoms. Due to discrepancies, varying dosages, and assessment techniques, further comprehensive studies are essential to determine the optimal dosage, long-term safety, and overall efficacy. Only through standardized trials can women make informed decisions about black cohosh as a viable alternative to hormone therapy during menopause."

      "abstract": "As a substitution for hormone replacement therapy, many breast cancer patients use black cohosh (BC) extracts in combination with doxorubicin (DOX)-based chemotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the viability and survival of BC- and DOX-treated MCF-7 cells. A preclinical model of MCF-7 xenografts was used to determine the influence of BC and DOX administration on tumor growth and metabolism. The number of apoptotic cells after incubation with both DOX and BC was significantly increased (~100%) compared to the control. Treatment with DOX altered the potential of MCF-7 cells to form colonies; however, coincubation with BC did not affect this process. In vivo, PET-CT imaging showed that combined treatment of DOX and BC induced a significant reduction in both metabolic activity (29%) and angiogenesis (32%). Both DOX and BC treatments inhibited tumor growth by 20% and 12%, respectively, and combined by 57%, vs. control. We successfully demonstrated that BC increases cytotoxic effects of DOX, resulting in a significant reduction in tumor size. Further studies regarding drug transport and tumor growth biomarkers are necessary to establish the underlying mechanism and potential clinical use of BC in breast cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Menopausal symptoms are common in midlife women and have broad impacts on their daily functioning and quality of life. Black cohosh extracts have been widely used to relieve menopausal symptoms. However, the comparative benefits of different combined black cohosh regimens remain inconclusive. The aim of the current updated meta-analysis is to address the comparative efficacies of different black cohosh regimens in improving menopausal symptoms. METHODS: Random-effect model pairwise meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to investigate the treatment effect on menopausal symptoms by the black cohosh extract both alone or combined with other related active ingredients. The outcomes studied were changes in menopausal symptoms after treatment with black cohosh extracts in menopausal women. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles including information on 2,310 menopausal women were included in the analyses. Black cohosh extracts were associated with significant improvements in overall menopausal symptoms (Hedges' g = 0.575, 95% CI = 0.283 to 0.867, P < 0.001), as well as in hot flashes (Hedges' g = 0.315, 95% CIs = 0.107 to 0.524, P = 0.003), and somatic symptoms (Hedges' g = 0.418, 95% CI = 0.165 to 0.670, P = 0.001), compared with placebo. However, black cohosh did not significantly improve anxiety (Hedges' g = 0.194, 95% CI = -0.296 to 0.684, P = 0.438) or depressive symptoms (Hedges' g = 0.406, 95% CI = -0.121 to 0.932, P = 0.131). The dropout rate for black cohosh products was similar to that for placebo (odds ratio = 0.911, 95% CI = 0.660 to 1.256, P = 0.568). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides updated evidence regarding the potentially beneficial effects of black cohosh extracts for relieving menopausal symptoms in menopausal women.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Black cohosh (BC) (Cimicifuga racemosa) may prevent and treat breast cancer through anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-estrogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects. This study sought to evaluate the effect of BC on tumor cellular proliferation, measured by Ki67 expression, in a pre-operative window trial of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) patients. METHODS: Patients were treated pre-operatively for 2 to 6 weeks with BC extract. Eligible subjects were those who had DCIS on core biopsy. Ki67 was measured using automated quantitative immunofluorescence (AQUA) pre/post-operatively. Ki67, tumor volume, and hormone changes were assessed with 2-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, α = .05. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated for an average of 24.5 days (median 25; range 15-36). Ki67 decreased non-significantly (n = 26; P = .20; median pre-treatment 1280, post-treatment 859; range pre-treatment 175-7438, post-treatment 162-3370). Tumor volume, estradiol, and FSH did not change significantly. No grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: BC use showed no significant impact on cellular proliferation, tumor volume, or invasive disease upgrade rates in DCIS patients. It was well-tolerated, with no observed significant toxicities.

Due to widespread usage, limited safety information, and sporadic reports of hepatotoxicity, the Division of the National Toxicology Program (DNTP) initially evaluated BC extract in female rats and mice. Following administration of up to 1000 mg/kg/day BC extract by gavage for 90 days, dose-related increases in micronucleated peripheral blood erythrocytes were observed, along with a nonregenerative macrocytic anemia resembling megaloblastic anemia in humans. Because both micronuclei and megaloblastic anemia may signal disruption of folate metabolism, and inadequate folate levels in early pregnancy can adversely affect neurodevelopment, the DNTP conducted a pilot cross-sectional study comparing erythrocyte micronucleus frequencies, folate and B12 levels, and a variety of hematological and clinical chemistry parameters between women who used BC and BC-naïve women. Twenty-three women were enrolled in the BC-exposed group and 28 in the BC-naïve group. Use of any brand of BC-only supplement for at least 3 months was required for inclusion in the BC-exposed group. Supplements were analyzed for chemical composition to allow cross-product comparisons. All participants were healthy, with no known exposures (e.g., x-rays, certain medications) that could influence study endpoints. Findings revealed no increased micronucleus frequencies and no hematological abnormalities in women who used BC supplements. Although reassuring, a larger, prospective study with fewer confounders (e.g., BC product diversity and duration of use) providing greater power to detect subtle effects would increase confidence in these findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endometriosis (EMS) is a relapsing and estrogen-dependent disease. For endometriosis such as deep endometriosis and ovarian endometrioid cysts, surgery is the most effective treatment. Long-term follow-up showed that the recurrence rate of endometriosis after surgical treatment was high, so postoperative drugs were needed to reduce recurrence, and Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) were the most commonly used drug for postoperative management.GnRH-a may reduce the post-treatment endometriosis relapses by lowering the hormone levels in the body. However, the use of GnRH-a can give rise to perimenopausal symptoms, especially osteoporosis, bone loss, and bone pain, for which reason GnRH-a use is often limited. The add-back therapy is often used to alleviate the untoward effects caused by GnRH-a. However, long-term use of hormone drugs may lead to EMS recurrence, thrombosis, and breast cancer. Therefore, a safer and more effective drug is urgently needed to alleviate the untoward effects caused by GnRH-a. In recent years, scholars at home and abroad have found that isopropanolic Cimicifuga racemosa extract (ICR), as a plant extract, can better relieve the symptoms of perimenopausal women. At the same time, some studies have initially confirmed that black cohosh preparations can relieve the perimenopausal symptoms caused by GnRH-a treatment in EMS patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of black cohosh preparations on the bone metabolism of rat models with GnRH-a-induced perimenopausal symptoms. METHODS: The rat models of perimenopausal symptoms were established by GnRH-a injection. and normal saline (NS injection) was used as the control. According to the modeling method and drug intervention, the rats were randomly divided into four groups: GnRH-a injection + saline intervention group (GnRH-a + NS), saline injection control + saline intervention group (NS + NS), GnRH-a injection + estradiol intervention group (GnRH-a + E2), and GnRH-a injection + black cohosh preparation intervention group (GnRH-a + ICR). The rat models were identified with the vaginal smear method, and then the corresponding drug intervention was administrated for 28 days. After the intervention, the rats were sacrificed. The rats' bone mineral density (BMD) of the distal femur was detected by a dual-energy X-ray bone density scanner. Rat tibia bone tissues were decalcified and made into slices. The pathological and morphological changes of rat tibial bones in each group were observed through HE staining. Histomorphometry parameters of rat tibial bones in each group, such as trabecular bone volume (TBV), trabecular thickness (TbTh), trabecular number (TbN), and trabecular spacing (TbSp), were detected and analyzed by using an automatic image analysis system. RESULTS: (1) The BMD level of the distal femur in the GnRH-a + NS group was significantly lower than the NS + NS, GnRH-a + E2, and GnRH-a + ICR groups (P<0.01), the BMD levels in GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups were slightly lower than the NS + NS group, but there was no significant difference among the three groups (P>0.05). (2) The pathological changes of the tibia bones under the microscope in different groups were as follows: The tibia bone trabecular structure was normal in the NS + NS group, without trabecular thinning or fracture, and the arch structure was normal. In the GnRH-a + NS group, some trabecular structures tapered, the arch structure disappeared, but no obvious bone fracture was observed in the trabecula. In the GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups, the trabecular structures were normal, without trabecular bone thinning or fracture, and the arch structures were normal. (3) The TBV level of the GnRH-a + INS group was significantly lower than that of the NS + NS, GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups (P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.01), while there was no significant difference among NS + NS, GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups (P>0.05). (4) The TbTh levels in the four groups had no significant difference (P>0.05). Compared with the NS + NS group, the TbTh levels in the GnRH-a + NS, GnRH-a + E2, and GnRH-a + ICR groups showed a descending tendency, while the TbTh levels in the GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups were slightly higher than that of the GnRH-a + NS group. However, such differences were not significant statistically (P>0.05). (5) Compared with the NS + NS group, the TbN levels in the GnRH-a + NS, GnRH-a + E2, and GnRH-a + ICR groups decreased remarkably (P<0.05). Compared with the GnRH-a + NS group, the TbN levels in the GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups showed a mild descending tendency, but such differences were not significant statistically (P>0.05). (6) The TbSp level of the GnRH-a + NS group was significantly higher than that of the NS + NS, GnRH-a + E2, and GnRH-a + ICR groups (P<0.01), while there was no significant difference among NS + NS, GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The GnRH-a injection could achieve the desired effect. GnRH-a injection may lead to the loss of bone mass in rats. Black cohosh preparations, like estrogen, may have a protective effect on bone mass loss caused by GnRH-a injection.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A panel of experts from both clinical and research backgrounds were assembled to investigate the best available evidence. Selected studies were obtained by an electronic search, including the Internet search engines MEDLINE-Pubmed (1997-December 2021) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. RESULTS: Most of the well-designed studies published in recent years have been conducted with the isopropanolic extract of black cohosh/C. racemosa. The most common dose is 40 mg/day capable of achieving a significant reduction in hot flushes (particularly in women with intense hot flushes) and an improvement in mood. Used at the recommended doses, C. racemose produces no significant adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: Black cohosh is an effective and safe treatment option for the relieving of vasomotor symptoms. Finally, further clinical trials with sufficient patient enrollment and longer study follow-up are needed.",

      "abstract": "Women's health is an imminent concern worldwide, but it remains an ignored segment of research in most developing countries, and is yet to take the center stage in even developed nations. Some exclusive female health concerns revolve around both pathological and physiological aspects. These gender-specific maladies include breast, cervical, and ovarian cancers, and physiological concerns such as menopause and osteoporosis, which are often coexistent. Recently, women's health issues, including postmenopausal syndrome, have attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners alike, opening newer pharmaceutical research and clinical avenues. Although not counted as a disease, postmenopausal syndrome (PMS) is a female health phenomenon underpinned by hormonal depletion. Enhanced life expectancy in women has added to their suffering, and pharmacological interventions are needed. Amongst the available treatment modalities, the use of numerous botanicals has emerged as an efficient health management tool for women. Cimicifuga racemosa (CR or Black Cohosh) is a plant/herb which has been traditionally exploited and extensively used by women. This review is an attempt to compile and provide a summary of the importance of CR in complementary and alternative therapies for the improvement of various disorders related to women, such as menopausal syndrome, mammary cancer, and osteoporosis. It aims to systematically highlight the bioactive constituents, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic potentials, quality control processes, chromatographic techniques, and possible mechanisms of action of clinically effective phytomedicine for women's health. Various clinical trials and patents relating to CR and women's health have been collated. Furthermore, the plant and its related products have been considered from a regulatory perspective to reveal its commercial feasibility. The present review summarizes the existing data on CR focusing on women's health, which can help to introduce this traditional phytomedicine to the world and provide some reference for future drug development."

      "abstract": "Black cohosh extract (BCE) is one of the most popular botanical products for relieving menopausal symptoms. However, recent studies indicate that BCE is not only ineffective for menopausal therapy but also induces genotoxicity through an aneugenic mode of action (MoA). In this study, the cytotoxicity of five constituents of BCE was evaluated in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. Among the five constituents, actein (up to 50 μM) showed the highest cytotoxicity and was thus selected for further genotoxicity evaluations. Actein caused DNA damage proportionally to concentration as evidenced by the phosphorylation of the histone protein H2A.X (γH2A.X) and resulted in chromosomal damage as measured by the increased percentage of micronuclei (%MN) in cells. In addition, actein activated DNA damage response (DDR) pathway through induction of p-ATM, p-Chk1, and p-Chk2, which subsequently induced cell cycle changes and apoptosis. Moreover, both BCE and actein increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased glutathione levels, and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway. N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger, attenuated BCE- and actein-induced ROS production, apoptosis, and DNA damage. These findings indicate that BCE- and actein-induced genotoxicity is mediated, at least partially, through oxidative stress. Taken together, our data show that actein is likely one of the major contributors to BCE-induced genotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endometriosis (EMS) is an estrogen-dependent disease, which easily recurs after operation. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), an estrogen-inhibiting drug, can effectively inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin by pituitary gland, so as to significantly decrease the ovarian hormone level and facilitate the atrophy of ectopic endometrium, playing a positive role in preventing postoperative recurrence. The application of GnRH-a can lead to the secondary low estrogen symptoms, namely the perimenopausal symptoms, and is a main reason for patients to give up further treatment. The add-back therapy based on sex hormones can well address the perimenopausal symptoms, but long-term use of hormones may cause the recurrence of EMS, as well as liver function damage, venous embolism, breast cancer and other risks, which has long been a heated topic in the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to find effective and safe anti-additive drugs soon. Studies at home and abroad show that, as a plant extract, isopropanolic extract of cimicifuga racemosa (ICR) can well relieve the perimenopausal symptoms caused by natural menopause. Some studies have preliminarily confirmed that black cohosh preparations can antagonize perimenopausal symptoms of EMS patients treated with GnRH-a after operation. OBJECTIVE: To establish a rat model of perimenopausal symptoms induced by GnRH-a injection, for the purposes of laying a foundation for further research and preliminarily exploring the effect of black cohosh preparations on reproductive endocrine of the rat model. METHOD: The rat model of perimenopausal symptoms was established by GnRH-a injection, and normal saline (NS injection) was used as the control. The rats were randomly divided into four groups according to different modeling methods and drug intervention schemes. GnRH-a injection + normal saline intervention group (GnRH-a + NS), normal saline injection control + normal saline intervention group (NS + NS), GnRH-a injection + estradiol intervention group (GnRH-a + E2), and GnRH-a injection + black cohosh preparations intervention group (GnRH-a + ICR). After modelling was assessed to be successful with the vaginal smear method, the corresponding drugs were given for intervention for 28d. In the process of rat modeling and drug intervention, the skin temperature and anus temperature of the rat tails were measured every other day, the body weights of the rats were measured every other day, and the dosage was adjusted according to the body weight. After the intervention was over, the serum sex hormone level, the uterine weight, the uterine index, and the endometrial histomorphology changes, as well as the ovarian weight, the ovarian index, and the morphological changes of ovarian tissues of each group were measured. RESULTS: (1) The vaginal cell smears of the control group (NS + NS) showed estrous cycle changes, while other model rats had no estrous cycle of vaginal cells. (2) The body weight gains of the GnRH-a + NS, GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups were significantly higher than that of the NS + NS control group. The intervention with E2 and ICR could delay the weight gain trend of rats induced by GnRH-A. (3) After GnRH-a injection, the temperature of the tail and anus of rats showed an overall upward trend, and the intervention with E2 and ICR could effectively improve such temperature change. (4) The E2, FSH, and LH levels in the GnRH-a + NS, GnRH-a + E2, and GnRH-a + ICR groups were significantly lower than those in the NS + NS group (P < 0.01). The E2 level was significantly higher and the LH level was significantly lower in the GnRH-a + E2 group than those in the GnRH-a + NS and GnRH-a + ICR groups (P < 0.05). Compared with those of the GnRH-a + NS and GnRH-a + ICR groups, the FSH level of the GnRH-a + E2 group showed a slight downward trend, but the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the levels of sex hormones between the GnRH-a + NS group and GnRH-a + ICR group (P > 0.05). (5) Compared with those of the NS + NS group, the uterine weight and uterine index of the GnRH-a + NS, GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups significantly decreased (P < 0.01). In a comparison between the groups, the uterine weight and uterine index in the GnRH-a + NS and GnRH-a + ICR groups were significantly lower than those in the GnRH-a + E2 group (P < 0.01). There was a statistical difference in the uterine weight and uterine index between the GnRH-a + NS group and GnRH-a + ICR group (P > 0.05). (6) Compared with those of the NS + NS group, the ovarian weight and ovarian index of the GnRH-a + NS, GnRH-a + E2 and GnRH-a + ICR groups significantly decreased (P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the ovarian weight and ovarian index among the GnRH-a + E2, GnRH-a + NS and GnRH-a + ICR groups (P > 0.05). (7) Compared with those in the NS + NS group, the number of primordial follicles increased significantly, while the number of growing follicles and mature follicles decreased significantly in the GnRH-a + NS, GnRH-a + E2, and GnRH-a + ICR groups (P < 0.01), but there was a statistical difference in the total number of follicles among the four groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The GnRH-a injection could achieve the desired effect. The animal model successfully achieved a significant decrease in the E2, FSH, and LH levels in rats, and could cause the rats to have rising body surface temperature similar to hot flashes in the perimenopausal period. The intervention with E2 and ICR could effectively relieve such \"perimenopausal symptoms\", and ICR had no obvious effect on the serum sex hormone level in rats.",

The aim of this review was to investigate whether there is scientific evidence that CR causes weight gain. We searched our database for medically confirmed, spontaneous adverse events regarding weight gain, literature for case reports and randomized controlled trials. Thirty cases in total were spontaneously reported in 15 years. The causality was not considered certain/likely in any of the cases. A nurse (consumer) assessed the causality as possible. Only one case was published in the literature. However, no change in body fat composition was reported, and the causality seems unlikely. Of the 31 identified studies, 17 were double-blind placebo-controlled, five were double-blind reference-controlled and nine were open reference-controlled. In total, 1839 women were treated with CR for up to 12 months. Two studies reported weight gain as an adverse event; however, no significant differences in weight changes were observed between the groups. One case of weight gain (about 2 kg) was reported, but the authors did not specify in which treatment group. In conclusion, this study provides no scientific evidence that the use of Cimicifuga racemosa causes weight gain in menopausal women.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed at assessing gene expression profiles in hippocampus and hypothalamus of ovariectomized (OVX) rats with or without treatment with an isopropanolic extract of Cimicifuga racemosa rhizomes (iCR) in comparison to intact rats. METHODS: Exploration of hippocampal (Hi) and hypothalamic (Hy) tissue from Sprague Dawley rats: without OVX (NHi = NHy = 4), tissues 3 months after OVX (NHi = 4, NHy = 3), or tissues of rats after their treatment with iCR for 3 months after OVX (NHi = NHy = 2). Gene expression profiles in these tissues were investigated by RNA-microarray-analysis and subsequent verification by qPCR. RESULTS: 4812 genes were differentially regulated when comparing the three groups in hippocampus and hypothalamus. iCR compensated the effects of OVX in 518 genes. This compensatory effect was most prominent in hippocampal signalling pathways, thereof genes (GAL, CALCA, HCRT, AVPR1A, PNOC, etc.) involved in thermoregulation, regulation of sleep and arousal, blood pressure regulation, metabolism, nociception, hormonal regulation, homeostasis, learning and cognition, mood regulation, neuroendocrine modulation, etc.. In the hypothalamus, iCR compensated OVX-effects at TAC3 and OPRM1 but not at KISS1. These genes are involved in the pathophysiology of hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study findings support a multifaceted mode of action of iCR in menopausal complaints on a tissue-specific brain gene expression level.",

      "abstract": "Actaea racemosa (AR) also known as Cimicifuga racemosa, is a perennial plant from Ranunculaceae family which was used as traditional remedies in treatment of various condition like rheumatoid muscular pain, headache, inflammation and dysmenorrhea. Actaea racemosa was basically native to Canada and the Eastern United State. This chapter proposed the ethnopharmacological uses of Actaea racemosa, and its phytochemical properties. Specifically, in this article we focused on use of Actaea racemose for menopausal and post-menopausal symptoms management. Electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus were searched for studies on Actaea racemose and its administration in management of menopausal symptoms. Chem Office software was also used in order to find chemical structures. The key words used as search terms were Cimicifuga racemose, Actaea racemose, Ranunculaceae, Black cohosh, Menopausal symptoms. We have included all relevant animal and human studies up to the date of publication. The analysis on Actaea racemose showed various indications for different plant's extracts. Approximately 131 chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from Actaea racemosa. According to recently studies, the most important chemicals known of the Actaea racemosa are phenolic compounds, chromones, triterpenoids, nitrogen-containing constituents. In addition, in vivo and in vitro studies reported wide range of pharmacological activities for Black cohosh like attenuating menopausal symptoms. Mechanism of action for some ethnomedicinal indications were made clear while some of its activities are not confirmed by pharmacological studies yet. Further investigations on its pharmacological properties are necessary to expand its clinical effective use. Also, additional large clinical trials are recommended for clarifying the effect of Black cohosh.",

      "abstract": "Black cohosh extract (BCE) is marketed to women as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy for alleviating menopausal symptoms. Previous studies by the National Toxicology Program revealed that BCE induced micronuclei (MN) and a nonregenerative macrocytic anemia in rats and mice, likely caused by disruption of the folate metabolism pathway. Additional work using TK6 cells showed that BCE induced aneugenicity by destabilizing microtubules. In the present study, BCE-induced MN were confirmed in TK6 and HepG2 cells. We then evaluated BCE-induced DNA damage using the comet assay at multiple time points (0.5-24 h). Following a 0.5-h exposure, BCE induced significant, concentration-dependent increases in %tail DNA in TK6 cells only. Although DNA damage decreased in TK6 cells over time, likely due to repair, small but statistically significant levels of DNA damage were observed after 2 and 4 h exposures to 250 µg/ml BCE. A G1/S arrest in TK6 cells exposed to 125 µg/ml BCE (24 h) was accompanied by apoptosis and increased expression of γH2A.X, p-Chk1, p-Chk2, p53, and p21. Conditioning TK6 cells to physiological levels of folic acid (120 nM) did not increase the sensitivity of cells to BCE-induced DNA damage. BCE did not alter global DNA methylation in TK6 and HepG2 cells cultured in standard medium. Our results suggest that BCE induces acute DNA strand breaks which are quickly repaired in TK6 cells, whereas DNA damage seen at 4 and 24 h may reflect apoptosis. The present study supports that BCE is genotoxic mainly by inducing MN with an aneugenic mode of action.",

      "abstract": "A systematic literature search revealed 35 clinical studies and one meta-analysis comprising 43,759 women, of which 13,096 were treated with isopropanolic Cimicifuga racemosa extract (iCR). Compared to placebo, iCR was significantly superior for treating neurovegetative and psychological menopausal symptoms, with a standardized mean difference of -0.694 in favor of iCR (p < 0.0001). Effect sizes were larger when higher dosages of iCR as monotherapy or in combination with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum [HP]) were given (-1.020 and -0.999, respectively), suggesting a dose-dependency. For psychological symptoms, the iCR+HP combination was superior to iCR monotherapy. Efficacy of iCR was comparable to low-dose transdermal estradiol or tibolone. Yet, due to its better tolerability, iCR had a significantly better benefit-risk profile than tibolone. Treatment with iCR/iCR+HP was well tolerated with few minor adverse events, with a frequency comparable to placebo. The clinical data did not reveal any evidence of hepatotoxicity. Hormone levels remained unchanged and estrogen-sensitive tissues (e.g. breast, endometrium) were unaffected by iCR treatment. As benefits clearly outweigh risks, iCR/iCR+HP should be recommended as an evidence-based treatment option for natural climacteric symptoms. With its good safety profile in general and at estrogen-sensitive organs, iCR as a non-hormonal herbal therapy can also be used in patients with hormone-dependent diseases who suffer from iatrogenic climacteric symptoms.",

We report a patient presenting with acute onset mania associated with black cohosh use, probably due to its psychopharmacological activities on serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors.

METHODS: Randomized clinical controlled trial about the improvement of low estrogen status caused by GnRHa with the treatment of BCE in patients with endometriosis after laparoscopic surgery were retrieved from Medline (Ovid), PubMed, Cochrane Library, CNKI, CBMdisc, Wanfang and VIP databases before January 2020, and meta-analysis of included studies was performed by Revman 5.3 software. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials involving 745 patients were included in this study. Meta-analysis results showed that the addition of BCE did not alter hormone levels of patients, including serum estradiol levels [ MD=1.24, 95% CI(-4.58, 7.08), P&gt;0.05] and luteinizing hormone levels [ MD=-0.02, 95% CI(-0.15, 0.11), P&gt;0.05]. BCE effectively improved the perimenopausal symptoms induced by low estrogen status:improving hectic fever and sweating [ OR=0.1, 95% CI(0.02, 0.47), P &lt; 0.01], reducing the occurrence of insomnia symptoms [ OR=0.23, 95% CI(0.13, 0.39), P &lt; 0.01], improving fatigue [ OR=0.09, 95% CI(0.04, 0.20), P &lt; 0.01], reducing the occurrence of vaginal dryness [ OR=0.04, 95% CI(0.01, 0.30), P &lt; 0.01].

The compounds considered responsible for the therapeutic effect are triterpene glycosides, characterized by a cycloartane scaffold and a pentose moiety. Because some of these triterpenoids were found to exhibit relevant cytotoxic effects against human breast cancer cells, we decided to investigate their activity on multiple myeloma cell lines NCI-H929, OPM-2, and U266. In a systematic approach, we initially tested three known cytotoxic compounds of three different triterpenoid types, revealing the cimigenol-type triterpenoid as the most active constituent. In a second round, seven naturally occurring cimigenol derivatives were compared with respect to their sugar moiety and their substitution pattern at position C-25, leading to 25-O-methylcimigenol-3-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside as the most potent candidate. Interestingly, not only the methyl group at position C-25 increased the cytotoxic effect but also the arabinose moiety at position C-3 had an impact on the activity. The variety of cimigenol derivatives, moreover, allowed a detailed discussion of their structure-activity relationships, not only for their effect on multiple myeloma cells but also with regard to previous studies on the cytotoxicity of black cohosh triterpenoids.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Black cohosh (BC) is an herbal remedy often used by women to treat symptoms associated with menopause. Research has shown that the molecular activity of BC is associated with estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α) regulation. Progesterone receptor (PR) expression is found to be consistent with ER expression and mutations in the BRCA1 gene, a tumor-suppressor gene, are known to be responsible for about 40%-45% of hereditary breast cancers. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of BC alone, as well as in combination with hormones and antihormones, on cell viability and expression of ER-α, PR, and BRCA1 in both T-47D and MCF-7 cell lines. METHODS: Cells were cultured in charcoal-stripped serum prior to their treatment and subsequent protein extraction. Western blot analyses were performed following a Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay and SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, with ECL luminescence and Image Studio Lite software. Cellular viability assays were performed using propidium iodine (PI) staining, and the distribution of fluorescent structures was evaluated through confocal microscopy. RT-qPCR analysis was performed on extracted cellular RNA. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, and data was subjected to Kruskal-Wallis testing, followed by post-hoc analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test to determine the statistical significance of all findings. RESULTS: Western blot analysis displayed significant alterations of ER-α, PR, and BRCA1 protein levels after 24-hour treatment with 80-500 μM BC. BC displayed a concentration-dependent decrease on ER-α and BRCA1 expression, with an 87% reduction of ER-α expression and a 43% of BRCA1 expression in T-47D cells compared to control. After six days of treatment with 400 μM BC, a 50% decrease in cell proliferation was observed. Following 24 hours of co-treatment with 400 μM BC and 10 nM E2, ER-α was downregulated by 90% and BRCA1 expression was reduced by 70% compared to control. The expression of PR, following the same treatment, exhibited similar effects. The proliferative effect of E2 was reduced in the presence of BC. CONCLUSION: Black Cohosh demonstrates substantial anti-cancer properties, and this study may significantly aid in the understanding of the molecular effects of BC on ER-α, PR, and BRCA1 in breast cancer cells."

      "abstract": "Endocrine therapy in breast cancer survivors can cause severe 'climacteric' symptoms, which may compromise therapy adherence. To determine whether such symptoms can be treated with herbal medication containing black cohosh in the form of isopropanolic Cimicifuga racemosa extract (iCR) alone or in fixed combination with St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum [HP]) (iCR + HP), a systematic literature search was conducted. Results were viewed in relation to experimental data and metabolism of endocrine therapies. Most breast cancer survivors receiving endocrine therapy experienced reductions in climacteric symptoms under iCR/iCR + HP. Tamoxifen's interference potential may be countered by using higher iCR doses or iCR + HP. No estrogen-like effects at the breast or on hormones were seen. After breast cancer, even if receiving tamoxifen, patients using iCR/iCR + HP had significantly increased recurrence-free survival rates compared to non-users. These results are substantiated by experimental data demonstrating antiproliferative and anti-invasive effects of iCR in breast cancer cells and enhancement of the antineoplastic effects of tamoxifen. There are no known clinical interactions for iCR and HP with endocrine therapies. The HP extract used in iCR + HP did not exhibit any clinically relevant interaction potential. In conclusion, with its positive benefit-risk profile, iCR/iCR + HP may offer a safe non-hormonal therapeutic option for breast cancer survivors receiving endocrine therapy.",

The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Cimicifuga racemosa in comparison with evening primrose oil (EPO) in postmenopausal women with menopause-related symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed on 80 postmenopausal women with hot flashes. The participants were randomly divided into two groups by blocked randomization. The participants of one group received black cohosh and the other group received EPO for 8 weeks. The severity and number of hot flashes and quality of life were measured by four-point scale, and the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire at pre-intervention, 1st, 4th, and 8th weeks after treatment. Data were analyzed in SPSS Version 16 using independent t-test, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Average severity of hot flashes in both groups and number of hot flashes in black cohosh group in 8th week were significantly lower than 1st week (P < 0.001), but number of hot flashes in primrose oil group in 8th week showed no significant differences (P = 0.32). The number of hot flashes and quality of life score in black cohosh arm compared to EPO showed a significant decrease in the 8th week (P < 0.05). All MENQOL scores were significantly improved in two groups (P < 0.05), but the percentage of improvement in black cohosh arm was significantly superior to EPO group. CONCLUSION: Both herbs were effective in reduction of severity of hot flashes and improvement of the quality of life, but it seems that black cohosh is more effective than primrose oil because it was able to reduce the number of hot flashes too."

      "abstract": "The North American plant Cimicifuga racemosa, also known as black cohosh (BC), is a herb that recently has gained attention for its hormonal effects. As the usage of hormone replacement therapy is declining due to its adverse effects in women with cancer, many are turning to herbal remedies like BC to treat menopausal symptoms. It is crucial to determine whether the effects of BC involve estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown ERα to be a possible molecular target for BC. In this study, we examined the effects of BC (8% triterpene glycosides) alone and in combination with hormones and antihormones on the cellular viability, expression of ERα and progesterone receptor (PR)-A/B, and cytolocalization of ERα in ER (+) and PR-A/B (+) T-47D breast cancer cells. Cells were cultured and proteins were extracted and quantified. Western blot analysis revealed alterations in the expression of ERα and PR after treatment with BC (5-100 µM). BC induced a concentration-dependent decrease in ERα and PR protein levels when compared to the control. Image cytometric analysis with propidium iodide staining was used to enumerate changes in T-47D cell number and viability. A decrease in T-47D cell viability was observed upon treatment with 5-100 µM BC. The ideal concentration of BC (100 µM) was used in combination with hormones and antihormones in an effort to further understand the possible similarities between this compound and other known effectors of ERα and PR. After a 24-hour concomitant treatment with and/or in combination of BC, estradiol, ICI 182, 780, and Tamoxifen, downregulation of ERα and PR protein levels was observed. Delineating the role of BC in the regulation of ERα, PR, as well as its mechanisms of action, may be important in understanding the influence of BC on hormone receptors in breast cancer."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of black cohosh and estrogen on the temperature in ovariectomized rats, the core body temperature (CBT) and tail-skin temperature (TST) were simultaneously monitored and the relationship between these two temperatures was explored. METHODS: Twenty-four female Sprague-Dawley rats aged 8 weeks were randomly divided into four groups: sham-operated (SHAM), ovariectomized (OVX), OVX treated with estradiol valerate (OVX + E), and OVX treated with isopropanolic black cohosh extract (OVX + ICR). Rats were sham-operated or ovariectomized and were implanted with telemetry transmitters with dual thermistor probes. Two weeks after surgery, the animals were treated with drugs for 4 weeks. During the last week of the treatments, the dynamic temperature profiles of the CBT and TST were collected. RESULTS: The average CBT and TST, TST fluctuation frequency, and the average amplitude fluctuation were significantly higher in OVX than in SHAM rats. In addition, dramatic fluctuations of TST in OVX rats occurred at the time points of the day when the CBTs were lower in OVX rats than in SHAM rats. Treatment of OVX rats with estradiol valerate or isopropanolic black cohosh extract markedly decreased the average CBT and TST, TST fluctuation frequency, and the average amplitude fluctuation. Moreover, CBT was found to be significantly higher, while TST was lower in OVX + E than in OVX + ICR rats. CONCLUSIONS: Both black cohosh and estradiol treatments ameliorated the abnormal thermoregulation in OVX rats. In particular, black cohosh reduced CBT better than estradiol and estradiol reduced TST better than black cohosh.",

      "abstract": "Oral dryness is a common feature in menopausal women. Estrogen therapy can relieve this symptom; however, the underlying mechanism was not clear. Standardized isopropanolic black cohosh (Actaea racemosa; Remifemin) can also relieve menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and sweating. Our previous study showed that standardized isopropanolic black cohosh could protect the submandibular gland structure. To investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of action of estrogen and standardized isopropanolic black cohosh on submandibular gland function in ovariectomized (OVX) rats, we measured body weight, daily water consumption, and blood flow in the submandibular glands. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to detect the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors 1 (M1) and 3 (M3), and aquaporin 5 (AQP5) in the submandibular gland. OVX increased daily water consumption and reduced vasodilation in the submandibular gland. It suggested that ovariectomy could damage the salviary function. Moreover, the expression of M1 and M3 receptors decreased, whereas that of AQP5 increased. These changes may explain the dysfunction of saliva secretion in menopause. Estrogen and standardized isopropanolic black cohosh treatment had the same effect on daily water consumption and vasodilation in the submandibular gland. It indicated that estrogen and standardized isopropanolic black cohosh could relieve oral dryness in menopause. However, the mechanism of the two treatments may differ because standardized isopropanolic black cohosh only protected against changes in M1 expression, whereas estrogen protected against variations in M1, M3, and AQP5 expression.",

      "abstract": "Actaea racemosa (black cohosh) has a history of traditional use in the treatment of general gynecological problems. However, the plant is known to be vulnerable to adulteration with other cohosh species. This study evaluated the use of shortwave infrared hyperspectral imaging (SWIR-HSI) in tandem with chemometric data analysis as a fast alternative method for the discrimination of four cohosh species (Actaea racemosa, Actaea podocarpa, Actaea pachypoda, Actaea cimicifuga) and 36 commercial products labelled as black cohosh. The raw material and commercial products were analyzed using SWIR-HSI and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) followed by chemometric modeling. From SWIR-HSI data (920 - 2514 nm), the range containing the discriminating information of the four species was identified as 1204 - 1480 nm using Matlab software. After reduction of the data set range, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machine discriminant analysis (SVM-DA) models with coefficients of determination (R2 ) of ≥ 0.8 were created. The novel SVM-DA model showed better predictions and was used to predict the commercial product content. Seven out of 36 commercial products were recognized by the SVM-DA model as being true black cohosh while 29 products indicated adulteration. Analysis of the UHPLC-MS data demonstrated that six commercial products could be authentic black cohosh. This was confirmed using the fragmentation patterns of three black cohosh markers (cimiracemoside C; 12-β,21-dihydroxycimigenol-3-O-L-arabinoside; and 24-O-acetylhydroshengmanol-3-O-β-D-xylopyranoside). SWIR-HSI in conjunction with chemometric tools (SVM-DA) could identify 80% adulteration of commercial products labelled as black cohosh.",

Ishikawa human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells were treated with or without BC (1, 5, 10 and 25 μM) and cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were measured by CCK-8 assays and flow cytometry analysis. Additionally, Ishikawa cells were treated with 17β-estradiol (E2), E2 + progesterone and E2 + BC (5 and 10 μM) and the effect of BC and progesterone on E2-induced cell proliferation was analyzed. BC decreased the proliferation of Ishikawa cells at a dose-dependent rate compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The proliferation of Ishikawa cells increased in the presence of E2, whereas the subsequent addition of progesterone or BC decreased proliferation to the level of the control group (p < 0.05). The inhibitory effect of BC on E2-induced cell proliferation was greater than the inhibitory effect of progesterone. In conclusion, BC induces apoptosis in Ishikawa cells and suppresses E2-induced cell proliferation in Ishikawa cells. BC could be considered a candidate co-treatment agent of estrogen-dependent tumors, especially those involving endometrial cells.",

Overharvesting of Black cohosh for the dietary supplement industry may result in its extirpation, and may also cause the elimination of the dependent butterfly. One way to increase or maintain the number of host plants in forested environments would be to reduce the number harvested, for example by increasing the levels of the desired metabolites in Black cohosh rhizomes. The secondary metabolites actein and deoxyactein are triterpene glycosides and are among the compounds associated with the putative activity of Black cohosh extracts. Acetein and deoxyacetein are used to standardize Black cohosh supplements. To gain an understanding of mechanisms that may control actein and deoxyactein accumulation, Black cohosh rhizomes were treated with exogenous salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, or ethylene, or were mechanically wounded. Salicylic acid treatment significantly increased the levels of actein and deoxyactein in the rhizome of Black cohosh, suggesting that the synthesis of triterpene glycosides is controlled in part by salicylic acid. Using salicylic acid or related chemicals to increase the levels of actein and deoxyactein in rhizomes may help supply the supplement industry and, simultaneously, help conserve Black cohosh and species dependent upon it.",

Black cohosh has been widely used as an alternative therapy in the treatment of menopausal syndrome. However, its role in metabolism needs to be defined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term effect of black cohosh on glucose and lipid metabolism in a rat model of post-menopause. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were sham operated (SHAM), ovariectomized (OVX), OVX with the treatment of estradiol valerate (OVX + E), or OVX with the treatment of isopropanolic black cohosh extract (OVX + iCR). Body weight, body composition, and blood glucose levels of the animals were monitored. The rats were then sacrificed after 3 months of the treatments. At the end of the experiment, OVX + iCR and OVX + E rats exhibited a significant decrease in body weight gain, body and abdominal fat mass, serum triglycerides levels, hepatic fat accumulation, and adipocyte hypertrophy compared with OVX rats. In addition, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance were improved in OVX + iCR but not in OVX + E rats. No hepatotoxicity was detected in OVX + iCR animals. Furthermore, western blot analysis suggested the increased lipolysis in adipose tissue of OVX + iCR and OVX + E rats. Data from in vitro experiments using cultured primary rat adipocytes also showed that black cohosh could affect lipolysis of adipocytes. In conclusion, the long-term treatment of black cohosh at a proper dosage ameliorated metabolic derangements in OVX rats. Thus, this drug is promising for the treatment of metabolic disorders in menopausal and post-menopausal women.",

The aim of our study was to look into the effect of black cohosh on both objective and subjective sleep in early postmenopausal women with sleep complaints. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled research during a 6-month period. Forty-eight postmenopausal women aged 45-60 years with sleep disturbance were enrolled and received daily administration of either black cohosh or placebo. Polysomnography and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were performed at the initiation and termination of the study, as well as the Menopause-specific Quality of Life questionnaire and estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone tests. Liver and renal functions and breast and pelvic ultrasound were set as safety measures, carried out every 3 months. RESULTS: Seventy-six women were interviewed, of whom 42 women completed the whole trial. Compared with placebo, black cohosh treatment led to significant polysomnographic changes, including increased sleep efficiency and decreased wake after sleep onset (WASO) duration, and tended to improve PSQI with a medium effect size. On average, 15.8% of WASO duration was reduced in the black cohosh group. Vasomotor and physical domains of life quality were improved compared with placebo. Safety measures did not yield any adverse event assigned to black cohosh. CONCLUSIONS: In early postmenopausal women with a major sleep complaint, black cohosh effectively improved sleep and might be a safe measure in managing menopausal sleep disturbance.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of testosterone, tibolone, and black cohosh on purified mammary and placental 17βHSD1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 17βHSD1 was purified from human mammary gland and placenta by column chromatography, its activity was monitored by a radioactive activity assay, and the degree of purification was determined by gel electrophoresis. Photometric cofactor transformation analysis was performed to assess 17βHSD1 activity without or in presence of testosterone, tibolone and black cohosh. RESULTS: 17βHSD1 from both sources displayed a comparable basal activity. Testosterone and tibolone metabolites inhibited purified mammary and placental 17βHSD1 activity to a different extent, whereas black cohosh had no impact. DISCUSSION: Studies on purified enzymes reveal the individual action of drugs on local regulatory mechanisms thus helping to develop more targeted therapeutic intervention. CONCLUSION: Testosterone, tibolone and black cohosh display a beneficial effect on local mammary estrogen metabolism by not affecting or decreasing local estradiol exposure.",

METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 84 early post-menopausal participants with Greene climacteric scale (GCS) scores of 15 to 42, who were referred to two public health care centers in Tehran, Iran, in 2011-2012. The participants were randomly allocated into treatment (6.5 mg of dried extract of Black cohosh roots daily) and control (placebo) groups with a ratio of 1:1. The participants took one tablet per day for 8 weeks. The GCS scores were recorded at baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Data analysis was carried out using a general linear model with repeated measures with SPSS software. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: There was no loss to follow-up during the 8 weeks of treatment. The GCS total score (primary outcome) in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group at both week 4 [adjusted mean difference: -7.8 (95% confidence interval: -11.1 to -4.4)] and week 8 [-12.9 (-16.2 to -9.3)]. The treatment group showed significantly more improvement than the control group in all GCS subscale scores (vasomotor, psychiatric, physical, and sexual symptoms; secondary outcomes). The differences between the treatment and control groups at week 8 were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those at week 4 in terms of the total scores and the vasomotor and psychiatric subscale scores. No side effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Black cohosh reduced the GCS total score and all GCS subscale scores (vasomotor, psychiatric, physical, and sexual symptoms) during 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was approved (Code 9061) by the Ethics Committee of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with IRCT201107186709N4 on 15 January 2012."

The severity of vasomotor symptoms and number of hot flashes were recorded during the pre-intervention phase, and 4 and 8 weeks after the intervention. The data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA tests. The level of significance was considered lower than 0.05. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of severity and number of hot flashes in weeks 4 and 8 by controlling the intensity of vasomotor symptoms and number of hot flashes before the intervention. Moreover, using repeated measures ANOVA, the intergroup comparison indicated a significant difference in bothgroups (the test and control groups) in terms of severity of vasomotor symptoms and number of hot flashes. CONCLUSION: According to the findings of the study, it seems that black cohosh can be used as an effective alternative medicine in relieving menopausal vasomotor symptoms."

Female B6C3F1/N mice were treated daily with BCE (0, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, or 1000mg/kg) for 28 days by oral gavage. Liver weights were significantly increased (26-32%) at the 1000mg/kg dose. Dose-related increases in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were observed. Decreasing trends were observed in all thymic T cell populations, with the most notable dose-responsive effects on immature thymocytes. In the spleen, dose-related decreases were observed in all cell phenotypes evaluated, reaching the level of statistical significance at the 1000mg/kg BCE dose. Splenic natural killer (NK) cell numbers were significantly decreased at all BCE doses, with the exception of absolute NK numbers at the 125mg/kg dose. No effects were observed on T-dependent antibody responses of the humoral immune system, including the antibody-forming cell response to sheep erythrocytes (sRBC) and IgM antibody levels to both sRBC and keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Cytotoxic T cell (TCTL) activity was increased, as was the mixed leukocyte response in one of two studies. Anti-CD3 mediated proliferation and the delayed-type hypersensitivity response were unaffected. No effects were observed on innate immunity or on bone marrow cellularity and colony-forming units. Overall, BCE exposure in B6C3F1/N mice for 28 days at doses up to 1000mg/kg had minimal immune effects, with the exception of an increased TCTL response.",

      "abstract": "In postmenopausal women estrogens in combination with progestins have beneficial effects on climacteric complaints and on osteoporosis but this hormone replacement therapy (HRT) bears the risk of increased mammary carcinomas and cardiovascular diseases. Phytoestrogens at low doses have little or no effects on climacteric complaints, at high doses they mimic the effects of estrogens. Therefore other plant derived substances are currently intensively investigated. Extracts of the rhizome of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa=CR) did not bind to estrogen receptors and were shown to be devoid of estrogenic effects on mammary cancer cells in vitro and on mammary gland and uterine histology in ovariectomized rats. In addition in this rat model the special extract CR BNO 1055 inhibited the occurrence of hot flushes and development of osteoporosis. In postmenopausal women CR BNO 1055 reduced major climacteric complaints as effectively as conjugated estrogens and significantly more than placebo. Similar data were published for other European CR preparations whereas 2 US American preparations were ineffective. This was most likely due to the too high doses or due to the adulteration with Asian Cimicifuga preparations. In all European studies neither effects in the uterus nor in mammary glands were observed. The effective compounds in CR are most likely neurotransmitter-mimetic in nature: dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and GABAergic effects were demonstrated and some have been structurally identified. We conclude that CR extracts at low doses are effective to ameliorate climacteric complaints but are devoid of adverse estrogenic effects. These finding strengthens the role of CR extracts as substitutes for HRT. This article is part of a special issue entitled: Special Issue on Phytoestrogens.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many women use black cohosh as a natural treatment for menopausal symptoms. However, controversy exists around safety in breast cancer, because of its purported estrogenic activity. We conducted a systematic review of black cohosh use in women with or at risk of breast cancer. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and AMED from inception to July 2012 and October 2012 for human interventional or observational data pertaining to the safety and efficacy of black cohosh in patients with or at risk of breast cancer, including an assessment of the effect of black cohosh on estrogen responsive tissues. RESULTS: Of 450 records, we included 26 articles: 14 randomized controlled trials, 7 uncontrolled trials, and 5 observational studies.The evidence on efficacy for ho t flashes is divided, with some benefits seen when compared with baseline, but not when compared with placebo. Two observational studies found no association between black cohosh and risk of breast cancer, whereas 2 studies reported significant reductions in risk of primary breast cancer among postmenopausal women (adjusted odds ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval = 0.27-0.82), and risk of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval = 0.63-0.89). Seventeen trials showed no significant impact on circulating hormone levels or proliferation in estrogen responsive tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence does not support an association between black cohosh and increased risk of breast cancer. There is a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of black cohosh for reduction of hot flashes in breast cancer patients. Given conflicting but promising results, and apparent safety, further research is warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Menopause can be a distressing and disruptive time for many women, with many experiencing hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal atrophy and dryness. Postmenopausal women are also at increased risk of osteoporosis. Interventions that decrease the severity and frequency of these menopausal symptoms are likely to improve a woman's well-being and quality of life. Hormone therapy has been shown to be effective in controlling the symptoms of menopause; however, many potentially serious adverse effects have been associated with this treatment. Evidence from experimental studies suggests that black cohosh may be a biologically plausible alternative treatment for menopause; even so, findings from studies investigating the clinical effectiveness of black cohosh have, to date, been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa or Actaea racemosa) for treating menopausal symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. SEARCH METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through AARP Ageline, AMED, AMI, BioMed Central gateway, CAM on PubMed, CINAHL, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Health Source Nursing/Academic edition, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, Natural medicines comprehensive database, PsycINFO, TRIP database, clinical trial registers and the reference lists of included trials; up to March 2012. Content experts and manufacturers of black cohosh extracts were also contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials comparing orally administered monopreparations of black cohosh to placebo or active medication in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and completed the 'Risk of bias' assessment. Study authors were contacted for missing information. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen randomised controlled trials, recruiting a total of 2027 perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, were identified. All studies used oral monopreparations of black cohosh at a median daily dose of 40 mg, for a mean duration of 23 weeks. Comparator interventions included placebo, hormone therapy, red clover and fluoxetine. Reported outcomes included vasomotor symptoms, vulvovaginal symptoms, menopausal symptom scores and adverse effects. There was no significant difference between black cohosh and placebo in the frequency of hot flushes (mean difference (MD) 0.07 flushes per day; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.43 to 0.56 flushes per day; P=0.79; 393 women; three trials; moderate heterogeneity: I(2) = 47%) or in menopausal symptom scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.10; 95% CI -0.32 to 0.11; P = 0.34; 357 women; four trials; low heterogeneity: I(2) = 21%). Compared to black cohosh, hormone therapy significantly reduced daily hot flush frequency (three trials; data not pooled) and menopausal symptom scores (SMD 0.32; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.51; P=0.0009; 468 women; five trials; substantial heterogeneity: I(2) = 69%). These findings should be interpreted with caution given the heterogeneity between studies. Comparisons of the effectiveness of black cohosh and other interventions were either inconclusive (because of considerable heterogeneity or an insufficient number of studies) or not statistically significant. Similarly, evidence on the safety of black cohosh was inconclusive, owing to poor reporting. There were insufficient data to pool results for health-related quality of life, sexuality, bone health, vulvovaginal atrophic symptoms and night sweats. No trials reported cost-effectiveness data. The quality of included trials was generally unclear, owing to inadequate reporting. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of black cohosh for menopausal symptoms. However, there is adequate justification for conducting further studies in this area. The uncertain quality of identified trials highlights the need for improved reporting of study methods, particularly with regards to allocation concealment and the handling of incomplete outcome data. The effect of black cohosh on other important outcomes, such as health-related quality of life, sexuality, bone health, night sweats and cost-effectiveness also warrants further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Black cohosh rhizome (Actaea racemosa) is used as a remedy for pain and gynecological ailments; modern preparations are commonly sold as ethanolic extracts available as dietary supplements. Black cohosh was nominated to the National Toxicology Program (NTP) for toxicity testing due to its widespread use and lack of safety data. Several commercially available black cohosh extracts (BCE) were characterized by the NTP, and one with chemical composition closest to formulations available to consumers was used for all studies. Female B6C3F1/N mice and Wistar Han rats were given 0, 15 (rats only), 62.5 (mice only), 125, 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day BCE by gavage for 90 days starting at weaning. BCE induced dose-dependent hematological changes consistent with a non-regenerative macrocytic anemia and increased frequencies of peripheral micronucleated red blood cells (RBC) in both species. Effects were more severe in mice, which had decreased RBC counts in all treatment groups and increased micronucleated RBC at doses above 125 mg/kg. Dose-dependent thymus and liver toxicity was observed in rats but not mice. No biologically significant effects were observed in other organs. Puberty was delayed 2.9 days at the highest treatment dose in rats; a similar magnitude delay in mice occurred in the 125 and 250 mg/kg groups but not at the higher doses. An additional uterotrophic assay conducted in mice exposed for 3 days to 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 500 mg/kg found no estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity. These are the first studies to observe adverse effects of BCE in rodents.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) Nutt. (CR), known as black cohosh, has been used in Europe as a medicinal plant for more than a century and its roots have been widely used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Remifemin, the main ingredient in liquid or tablet medications prepared from isopropyl alcohol extracts of black cohosh rhizome, has also been evaluated in clinical studies. OBJECTIVES: To observe changes in the expression of the c-Fos protein in the hypothalamic nuclei of four groups of rats-sham-operated group (SHAM), ovariectomized (OVX) group, ovariectomized group treated with estrogen(OVX+E), and ovariectomized group treated with the isopropanol extract of Cimicifuga racemosa (OVX+ICR)-and to investigate the mechanisms of black cohosh and estrogen that take place in the hypothalamic nuclei of ovariectomized rats. METHODS: Fifty rats were assigned to each of the four groups and placed in incubators at 4 °C, 10 °C, 25 °C, 33 °C, or 38 °C for 2 h. They were then anesthetized, and their brains were removed after heart perfusion. c-Fos expression in the hypothalamic nuclei was evaluated using immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: In the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), ventromedial preoptic nucleus (VMPO), and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCh) of the SHAM group, in the anterior hypothalamic area (AH) and supraoptic nucleus (SO) of all four groups, and in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the SHAM, OVX and OVX+E groups, the c-Fos-positive cell densities all changed in a similar manner: the cell density decreased when the temperature was less than 25 °C and the density increased when the temperature was greater than 25 °C, demonstrating a V-type curve. The c-Fos density was lowest at 25°C. The other nuclei demonstrated irregular changes. The positive cell densities in the MnPO, AH, and PVN of the SHAM, OVX+E, and OVX+ICR groups were greater than the densities measured in the OVX group at all temperatures, except 25 °C. Positive cell densities in the SHAM, OVX+E, and OVX+ICR groups were greater than the densities measured in the OVX groups in the MPA at 25 °C, in the VMPO at 4 °C, 33 °C, and 38 °C, in the SO at 4 °C, 10 °C, and 38 °C, and in the SCh at 33 °C. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the temperature, positive cell densities were lower in the MnPO, MPA, VMPO, AH, SCh, SO, and PVN of the OVX groups in comparison with the densities measured in the same sites in the SHAM group. Following the administration of black cohosh and estrogen, the positive cell densities in the OVX groups increased and became closer to, or exceeded, those measured in the SHAM group, suggesting that both drugs may act on the hypothalamic nuclei and have therapeutic effects on menopausal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies indicate that extracts and purified components from black cohosh inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells, but the molecular targets and signaling pathways have not yet been defined. PURPOSE: This study examines the pharmacological mechanisms and toxicological effects in the short term of the herb black cohosh on female Sprague-Dawley rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess effects on gene activity and lipid content, we treated female Sprague-Dawley rats with an extract of black cohosh enriched in triterpene glycosides (27%) at 35.7 or 0mg/kg. Four animals for each group were sacrificed at 1, 6 and 24h after treatment; liver tissue and serum samples were obtained for gene expression and lipid analysis. RESULTS: Microarray analysis of rat liver tissue indicated that black cohosh markedly downregulated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes. Phospholipid biosynthesis and remodeling, PI3-Kinase and sphingosine signaling were upregulated, driven largely by an upregulation of several isoforms of phospholipase C. Hierarchical clustering indicated that black cohosh clustered with antiproliferative compounds, specifically tubulin binding vinca alkaloids and DNA alkylators. In support of this, black cohosh repressed the expression of cyclin D1 and ID3, and inhibited the proliferation of HepG2, p53 positive, liver cancer cells. Black cohosh reduced the level of free fatty acids at 6 and 24h and triglycerides at 6h in the serum, but increased the free fatty acid and triglyceride content of the treated livers at 24h. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that black cohosh warrants further study for breast cancer prevention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "AIM OF THE STUDY: The rhizome of the Cimicifuga racemosa (commonly known as black cohosh) has been used in treatment of climacteric complaints for decades in North America and Europe. A number of studies investigated the estrogenic potential of black cohosh, but its effectiveness is still controversial. Recently, it was reported that the extract of black cohosh acted as an agonist at the serotonin (5-HT) receptor and 5-HT derivative was isolated out of the black cohosh extract. Because it is well known that the 5-HT elicited the various cardiovascular effects including vasorelaxation, we investigated the vasorelaxant effects of the extract of black cohosh and its possible mechanisms of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extract of black cohosh (BcEx) was examined for its vasorelaxant effects in isolated rat aorta. The aortic rings were equilibrated under resting tension and induced reproducible contraction in organ bath. The control contraction was produced by 300 nM NE, and then BcEx were added. In experiments where specific inhibitors were used, they were added 20 min before NE contraction. RESULTS: BcEx elicited two phases of relaxation in rat aorta pre-contracted with norepinephrine. The first, a rapid relaxation, which occurred within seconds of BcEx administration, was eliminated by pretreatment with N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA) or methylene blue. The endogenous NO synthase substrate l-Arg markedly reversed the action of l-NNA, indicating that BcEx elicited the vasorelaxant effect via the NO/cGMP pathway. The second, slowly developing relaxation was not affected by the endothelium denudation. BcEx-induced endothelium-independent vasorelaxation appears to involve the inhibition of calcium influx mediated by the opening of inward rectifier potassium channels. CONCLUSIONS: BcEx elicits the vasorelaxant effect via endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms and may contribute to a better understanding of a potential link between the use of black cohosh and its beneficial effects on vascular health.",

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 154 postmenopausal women randomized to estradiol 2 mg/norethisterone acetate 1 mg (E2/NETA), tibolone 2.5 mg or placebo and a prospective, open, uncontrolled drug safety study, of which 65 postmenopausal women were treated with black cohosh. Mammograms, at baseline and after six months of treatment, were previously classified according to visual quantification scales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reanalysis of assessable mammograms by digitized quantification of breast density. RESULTS: Treatment groups were comparable at baseline. During treatment, both E2/NETA and tibolone significantly increased breast density (mean increase 14.3%, p<0.001 and 2.3%, p<0.001, respectively), while black cohosh and placebo did not. Twenty-four out of the 43 women on E2/NETA had an increase in density exceeding 10% and 6 women had an increase of 30% or more. In the tibolone group, only one woman had an increase in density of more than 10%. The difference in increase in breast density between E2/NETA on the one hand and tibolone, black cohosh and placebo on the other was highly significant (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Digitized mammographic breast density is a highly sensitive method confirming significant increase in density by standard E2/NETA treatment and to a lesser extent by tibolone, whereas black cohosh does not influence mammographic breast density during six months treatment. Digitized assessment also yields data on individual variation and small increases left undetectable by visual classification.",

Since pharmacological activity of TAM is dependent on the metabolic conversion into active metabolites by the action of cytochromes P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and 3A4, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether black cohosh extracts can inhibit formation of active TAM metabolites and possibly reduce its clinical efficacy. At 50 μg/mL, a 75% ethanolic extract of black cohosh inhibited formation of 4-hydroxy- TAM by 66.3%, N-desmethyl TAM by 74.6% and α-hydroxy TAM by 80.3%. In addition, using midazolam and dextromethorphan as probe substrates, this extract inhibited CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 with IC(50) values of 16.5 and 50.1 μg/mL, respectively. Eight triterpene glycosides were identified as competitive CYP3A4 inhibitors with IC(50) values ranging from 2.3-5.1 µM, while the alkaloids protopine and allocryptopine were identified as competitive CYP2D6 inhibitors with K(i) values of 78 and 122 nM, respectively. The results of this study suggests that co-administration of black cohosh with TAM might interfere with the clinical efficacy of this drug. However, additional clinical studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of these in vitro results."

Lacking in almost all of them a precise description of cases, especially a botanical-chemical analysis of the suspected substance, we think there is no real proof of supposed C. racemosa rhizome hepatotoxicity. In our department we administer from about 10 years C. racemosa as special herbal dry extract as single substance or mixed with other medicinal plants at the dose of 500-1000 mg daily, for treatment of menopause related disorders without any reported adverse effect. After EMEA's official signal we have contacted all our patients using a C. racemosa rhizome herbal extract continuously from more than 12 months to verify possible hepatotoxic effects. We followed-up 107 women, and asked them by telephone (33/107) and/or after anamnesis and clinical examination (74/107) to undergo a blood sample examination. In all the patients there was no sign of hepatic disease, or worsening of already altered but stable parameters. We think on the base of these data and current literature C. racemosa rhizome extract should not be considered a potential hepatotoxic substance."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The popular use of black cohosh products (Actaea racemosa L., syn. Cimicifuga racemosa L.) is growing as the demand for alternatives to estrogen therapy has increased. Critical to safe use is the assurance of unadulterated, high-quality products. Questions have been raised about the safety of black cohosh due to cases of liver toxicity in patients who reported taking it; subsequent evaluation found some products to be adulterated with other related herbal species. Correct plant species identification is a key first step for good manufacturing practices of safe black cohosh products. OBJECTIVES: To develop analytical methods which distinguish black cohosh from other species (American and Asian) of Actaea increasingly found as adulterants in commercially available black cohosh products. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen species of Actaea were collected from North America and Asia, and the phytochemical fingerprints of these samples were established using HPLC-PDA and LC-MS techniques. RESULTS: The HPLC and LC-MS fingerprints for polyphenols and triterpene glycosides revealed distinct patterns that make black cohosh clearly distinguishable from most other species of Actaea. Two marker compounds, cimifugin and cimiracemoside F, were found to be important to distinguish black cohosh from most Asian species of Actaea. Formononetin was not found from either Asian or American species of Actaea. CONCLUSIONS: Phytochemical fingerprinting is a practical, reliable method for authenticating black cohosh and distinguishing it from other species of Actaea increasingly found as adulterants in commercially available black cohosh products. This should facilitate the continued development of high-quality, unadulterated black cohosh products.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The antihormonal therapy of breast cancer patients with the antiestrogen tamoxifen often induces or aggravates menopausal complaints. As estrogen substitution is contraindicated, herbal alternatives, e.g. extracts of black cohosh are often used. DESIGN: A prospective observational study was carried out in 50 breast cancer patients with tamoxifen treatment. All patients had had surgery, most of them had undergone radiation therapy (87%) and approximately 50% had received chemotherapy. Every patient was treated with an isopropanolic extract of black cohosh (1-4 tablets, 2.5 mg) for 6 months. Patients recorded their complaints before therapy and after 1, 3, and 6 months of therapy using the menopause rating scale (MRS II). RESULTS: The reduction of the total MRS II score under black cohosh treatment from 17.6 to 13.6 was statistically significant. Hot flashes, sweating, sleep problems, and anxiety improved, whereas urogenital and musculoskeletal complaints did not change. In all, 22 patients reported adverse events, none of which were linked with the study medication; 90% reported the tolerability of the black cohosh extract as very good or good. CONCLUSIONS: Black cohosh extract seems to be a reasonable treatment approach in tamoxifen treated breast cancer patients with predominantly psychovegetative symptoms.",

The purpose of this investigation was to analyze data gained from clinical trials on the effect of black cohosh on liver function. METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, and controlled clinical trials was conducted. These studies primarily evaluated the efficacy and safety of the isopropanolic black cohosh extract (iCR) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Raw data on liver function values of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase were considered in this analysis, if these data at baseline and after 3 to 6 months of treatment were available. Standard methods of descriptive statistics were used in this analysis. RESULTS: Five studies involving a total of 1,117 women were included in the meta-analyses. A total of 1,020 women (test population=517 and reference population=503) completed the studies. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women (40-60 y) were treated daily with iCR (corresponding to 40-128 mg drug) for 3 to 6 months. The meta-analyses of the standardized mean differences in the \"test\" versus \"reference\" showed no significant effects and no differences between double-blind, placebo-controlled and other trials. The overall fixed effect ± SEM was 0.055 ± 0.062 (P=0.37) for aspartate aminotransferase and 0.063 ± 0.062 (P=0.31) for alanine aminotransferase. The nonsignificant effects concerned the overall analyses of all included studies as well as the proportion of placebo-controlled studies. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis of five randomized, double-blind, and controlled clinical trials showed no evidence that iCR has any adverse effect on liver function.",

      "abstract": "Black cohosh (BC) has been widely applied for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. However, increasing concerns about herb-drug interactions demand the need for studies on the influence of BC on cytochrome 450. Cyp3a11 in liver was induced by 7-fold in wild-type mice treated with 500 mg/kg black cohosh for 28 days compared with the control group as assessed by quantitative real-time PCR; no difference was found in small intestine and kidney, suggesting that up-regulation of Cyp3a11 by black cohosh was liver-specific. Western blot, activity assays, and pharmacokinetic analyses established dose- and time-dependent induction of Cyp3a11. To determine the mechanism of Cyp3a11 induction, including the role of pregnane X receptor (PXR) in vivo and in vitro, respectively, in Pxr-null, PXR-humanized, and double transgenic CYP3A4/hPXR mice, cell-based luciferase assays were employed revealing that mouse PXR played a direct role in the induction of Cyp3a11; human PXR was not activated by black cohosh. Overall, these findings demonstrate that induction of Cyp3a11 is liver-specific and involved only mouse PXR, not the human counterpart. Thus, the incidence of herb-drug interaction in patients administered black cohosh may not be mediated by human PXR and CYP3A4.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis and its accompanying, predominantly metaphyseal, fractures are a major health problem. Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) and estrogen positively influence osteoporotic bone. Both substances may improve fracture healing in early osteoporosis as well. In 48 twelve-week-old ovariectomized or, respectively, sham-operated (SHAM) rats, a standardized metaphyseal tibia osteotomy with bridging T-plate fixation was performed. During the healing process of 35 days, rats received soy-free (SHAM, osteopenic C), estrogen- (E) or Cimicifuga racemosa- (CR) supplemented diets. After sacrifice, the callus formation was analyzed with regard to biomechanical quality, morphology, quantity, time course of new bone built and gene expression. CR induced a high rate of metaphyseal callus formation. The biomechanical properties and the amount of new callus formation indicated that fracture healing was still in progress. Therefore, gene expression of osteoblasts was comparatively high. Body weight and the trabecular structure were influenced little by CR. Estrogen improved the biomechanical properties of the callus. Resistance to microfracturing was significantly enhanced in the E group and even superior to SHAM. Remodeling of the callus formation had already begun. The trabecular network and the typical endosteal fracture healing were especially improved. Osteoporotic metaphyseal fracture healing was improved by estrogen more than by Cimicifuga racemosa. The process of fracture healing occurred nearly physiologically. The generation of callus formation was supported by Cimicifuga racemosa as well, but the five-week duration of application was too short for Cimicifuga racemosa to show its complete potential. Already-initiated Cimicifuga racemosa therapy for menopausal symptoms could be continued during fracture healing without hesitation.",

Of the 288 English language citations screened, nine randomized placebo-controlled trials were included. Among these trials, six demonstrated a significant improvement in the black cohosh group compared with the placebo group. Using data from seven trials, we calculated a combined estimate for the change in menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Preparations containing black cohosh improved these symptoms overall by 26% (95% confidence interval 11%-40%); there was, however, significant heterogeneity between these trials. Given that black cohosh is one of the most frequently used herbal medications for menopausal vasomotor symptoms in North America, more data are warranted on its effectiveness and safety.",

Single doses of black cohosh extract containing 1.4, 2.8, or 5.6 mg of 23-epi-26-deoxyactein were administered to 15 healthy, menopausal women. Serial blood samples and 24-h urine samples were obtained; blood chemistry, hormonal levels, and 23-epi-26-deoxyactein levels were determined. No acute toxicity or estrogenic hormone effects were observed. Pharmacokinetic analyses of 23-epi-26-deoxyactein in sera indicated that the maximum concentration and area under the curve increased proportionately with dosage, and that the half-life was ~2 h for all dosages. Less than 0.01% of the 23-epi-26-deoxyactein was recovered in urine 24 h after administration. No phase I or phase II metabolites were observed either in clinical specimens or in vitro.",

We hypothesized that black cohosh would be superior to placebo in reducing anxiety symptoms of menopause, with a comparable tolerability profile to placebo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were randomized to therapy with either pharmaceutical-grade black cohosh extract (n = 15) or placebo (n = 13) for up to 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was changed over time in total Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores. Secondary outcomes included a change in scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Green Climacteric Scale (GCS), and Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) and the proportion of patients with a change of 50% or higher in baseline HAM-A scores. RESULTS: There was neither a significant group difference in change over time in total HAM-A scores (P = 0.294) nor a group difference in the proportion of subjects with a reduction of 50% or higher in baseline HAM-A scores at study end point (P = 0.79). There was a significantly greater reduction in the total GCS scores during placebo (vs black cohosh; P = 0.035) but no group difference in change over time in the GCS subscale scores or in the PGWBI (P = 0.140). One subject (3.6%) taking black cohosh discontinued treatment because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: We found no statistically significant anxiolytic effect of black cohosh (vs placebo). However, small sample size, choice of black cohosh preparation, and dosage used may have been limiting factors producing negative results.",

METHODS: This study was a randomized, four-arm, double-blind clinical trial of standardized black cohosh, red clover, placebo, and 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE/MPA; n = 89). Primary outcome measures were reduction in vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) by black cohosh and red clover compared with placebo; secondary outcomes included safety evaluation, reduction of somatic symptoms, relief of sexual dysfunction, and overall improvement in quality of life. RESULTS: Reductions in number of vasomotor symptoms after a 12-month intervention were as follows: black cohosh (34%), red clover (57%), placebo (63%), and CEE/MPA (94%), with only CEE/MPA differing significantly from placebo. Black cohosh and red clover did not significantly reduce the frequency of vasomotor symptoms as compared with placebo. Secondary measures indicated that both botanicals were safe as administered. In general, there were no improvements in other menopausal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, black cohosh and red clover did not reduce the number of vasomotor symptoms. Safety monitoring indicated that chemically and biologically standardized extracts of black cohosh and red clover were safe during daily administration for 12 months.",

METHODS: We have analyzed and reviewed the data of all 69 reported cases with suspected BC hepatotoxicity. Causality for BC was assessed utilizing the scale of the original structured quantitative Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), or the main-test as its updated form. RESULTS: With the hepatotoxicity specific causality assessment methods, there was an excluded, unlikely, unrelated or unassessable causality for BC in 68 of 69 cases with liver disease. One patient had a possible causality for BC and a symptomatic cholelithiasis with confounding variables of fatty liver of unknown etiology; unknown BC brand including possible herbal mixture; unknown daily BC dosage; and an unassessable duration of BC usage. In general, the cases of the 69 patients were poorly documented. Confounding variables were: failure to identify the BC product; use of herbal mixtures with multiple ingredients in addition to BC; co-medication with synthetic drugs and dietary supplements including herbal ones; missing temporal association between BC use and development of liver disease; not specified modalities of BC treatment; failure of dechallenge after BC discontinuation; pre-existing liver diseases; insufficiently excluded other liver diseases; presence of alternative liver diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of 69 cases shows little, if any, supportive evidence for a significant hepatotoxic risk of BC.",

Recently, worldwide discussions have emerged as to whether its use maybe associated with the risk of rare hepatotoxicity in a few susceptible women. METHODS: We have evaluated the causal relationship in nine cases with suspected hepatotoxicity by the use of BC. The updated Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale was used to quantitatively assess the causality for BC. RESULTS: In eight of nine patients with liver disease, causality for BC +/- comedication was excluded (n = 4) or unlikely (n = 4). The failure to ascribe causality in these cases was mainly due to alternative diagnosis, missing temporal association and dechallenge, and presentation of low quality data. In only one case, causality was possible for a BC preparation of an unknown brand taken for 2 months with an unknown daily dose. Confounding factors in this case include symptomatic cholelithiasis and fatty liver. Comedication with synthetic drugs and herbal or other dietary supplements was reported in five of nine patients. CONCLUSIONS: In nine cases of patients with liver disease, causality for BC +/- comedication was possible (n = 1), unlikely (n = 4), or excluded (n = 4). Due to this lack of significant circumstantial evidence, the present study shows little, if any, hepatotoxic risks by the use of BC in the analyzed cases.",

Other adulterants found in today's global marketplace are the 3 Asian Cimicifuga species C. foetida, C. heracleifolia, and C. dahurica. A very practical, rapid, and reliable high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method was developed for identification of C. racemosa and detection of its most common adulterants by fingerprint profiles. With specific derivatization reagents, mixtures of C. racemosa with a minimum of 5% of one of the adulterants can be detected. The proposed method was validated with respect to specificity, stability, precision, and robustness. It can be used for quality control of black cohosh raw material in a current Good Manufacturing Practices environment.",

      "abstract": "Alternative medicine preparations represent a significant industry worldwide. Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa), a buttercup plant grown in North America, is one such popular preparation for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Because the proportion of women experiencing climacteric symptoms is high, black cohosh merits further study as to its efficacy and safety. Convincing evidence for its efficacy in this setting remains to be demonstrated. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the current literature on the benefits of black cohosh for women experiencing climacteric symptoms. To this end, a PubMed search was conducted on 1 November 2007 using the search terms 'black cohosh' AND 'menopause'. The search was limited to randomized controlled trials in the English language involving adults. Several additional reviews dealing with alternative therapies for menopause were included to capture additional older and non-English language literature. Ultimately, 16 studies eligible for review were identified. Many of the studies had conflicting results. Methodological flaws included lack of uniformity of the drug preparation used, variable outcome measures and lack of a placebo group. The benefits of black cohosh in the management of climacteric symptoms remain to be proven. Case studies suggest an additional unexplored area of adverse events that also needs to be addressed.",

      "abstract": "Severe hepatotoxicity has been described as spontaneous or case reports in 42 patients in assumed causal relationship with the treatment by Cimicifugae racemosae rhizoma corresponding to the root of black cohosh (BC) for postmenopausal symptoms. However, an assessment by EMEA (European Medicines Agency) has shown a possible or probable causality in only 4 out of 42 patients. A diagnostic algorithm was now applied in the 4 patients with suspected BC hepatotoxicity, which included the qualitative and quantitative causality assessment of the updated system of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), allowing the study to objectively assess, score and scale the probability in each case. Due to incomplete data, the case of 1 patient was not assessable. In the remaining 3 patients, a severe course of liver disease was apparent, and steroid therapy was initiated under the provisional diagnosis of drug-induced hepatic injury. The analysis shows, however, that the observed liver diseases were unrelated to drugs. Only 1 patient had a favourable course under continued steroid therapy, and the final diagnosis was autoimmune hepatitis. The 2 other patients required liver transplantation under the final diagnosis of herpetic hepatitis established now. Quantitative evaluation showed no causality for BC in all 3 patients regarding the observed severe liver disease. Using a thorough causality assessment in the form of a diagnostic algorithm we have shown that there is no evidence for a causal relationship between treatment by black cohosh and the observed liver disease in the 4 patients.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Extracts of the black cohosh (Actaea/Cimicifuga racemosa (CR)) have long been used to treat estrogen deficiency symptoms in women after menopause. Recent data from randomized controlled studies have shown that CR consumption alleviates \"hot flushes\" and due to the lack of uterotropic effects can be a safe alternative to estrogen replacement therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of dietary CR extract consumption on body weight (BW) gain, intra-abdominal fat (IAF) accumulation, plasma leptin, lipids and glucose tolerance in ovariectomized rats and to compare them with the effects of 17beta-estradiol. DESIGN: Twenty-seven female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized and fed soy-free chow with the addition of estradiol-3 benzoate (E2B) (10mg/kg, n = 10) or CR BNO 1055 extract (6.67 g/kg, n = 9). The control group (n = 8) received soy-free chow only. Weight and food intake were recorded once a week. After 6 weeks, intra-abdominal fat was measured using computer tomography and the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed. In the seventh week of the experiment animals were sacrificed, blood was collected for plasma and uteri were removed. RESULTS: Dietary CR BNO 1055 extract had no effects on uterine mass but significantly reduced serum lutenizing hormone (LH) levels (P < 0.05). Although, the average weekly food consumption throughout the experiment (calculated in g/kg of BW) did not differ between our studied groups, E2B or CR BNO 1055 treated animals gained less weight and had significantly less IAF accumulation compared to control animals (P < 0.05). E2B treatment also decreased plasma total (T-,) high-density lipoprotein (HDL-) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (P < 0.05). Plasma T-Ch levels in CR BNO 1055 treated animals did not differ from the controls whereas LDL-Ch levels were significantly higher and plasma triglycerides (TG) significantly lower (P<0.05). In the glucose tolerance test, the area under the curve (AUC) was significantly smaller in the E2B treated animals compared to controls (P<0.05). AUC in CR BNO 1055 treated animals did not differ significantly from the controls (P>0.05). Nevertheless, fasting plasma insulin (FPI) levels were significantly lower in E2B and CR BNO 1055 treated animals (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In OVX rats, CR BNO 1055 extract consumption decreases enhanced pituitary LH secretion, attenuates body weight gain and IAF accumulation, lowers FPI and has no effects on uterine mass. The effects on plasma lipids seem to be more complex and are characterized by an increase of LDL-Ch and decrease of TG levels which is in contrast to the effects of estrogen.",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of vasomotor symptoms in women is directly related to deficiency of estrogen, which occurs as a result of natural or surgical menopause. Hot flushes may also be a major problem for patients with a history of breast cancer, as they may result directly from cancer treatment (oophorectomy, chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure or adjuvant tamoxifen citrate therapy). Despite the lack of reliable data regarding their efficacy and safety, in recent years the usage of herbs among menopausal women has increased dynamically all over the world. The following paper reviews professional literature about Black Cohosh (Actaea/Cimicifuga racemosa), either used alone or in combination with other medicinal herbs administered in management of vasomotor symptoms. Extracts of the rootstock of Black cohosh contain such potentially biologically active constituents as triterpene glycosides (actein, cimicifugoside, deoxyacetein), isoferulic acid and alkaloids (n-methylcytisine). The mechanism of its action remains unclear. Some authors suggest that Black Cohosh contains substances with selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) activity. Recent data has demonstrated that Black Cohosh may have an effect on dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems. Thirty-two papers formed the basis for this review. Open-label, noncomparative studies, as well as treatment-controlled, randomized, open trials, have proven that Black Cohosh significantly reduced frequency or severity of hot flashes. The results of randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials were contradictory. Adverse symptoms have been rare (5,4%), mild and reversible. Most of them included gastrointestinal upsets, rashes, headaches, dizziness and mastalgia. Nevertheless, single cases of serious adverse events, including acute hepatocellular damage, have been reported, but without a clear causality relationship.",

These therapies include herbal preparations such as black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa). The purpose of this update of a previous systematic review is to evaluate the clinical evidence for or against the efficacy of black cohosh in alleviating menopausal symptoms. Five computerized databases (Medline, Embase, Amed, Phytobase and Cochrane Library) were searched to identify all clinical data that provided evidence on the efficacy of C. racemosa. Bibliographies of the articles thus located were scanned for further relevant publications. Only double blind, randomized, clinical trials (RCTs) were included in the evaluation of efficacy. No language restrictions were imposed. Trials were excluded if they did not focus on menopausal problems, they included women suffering medically induced menopause, they did not use black cohosh monopreparations, or they did not use placebo or a standard drug treatment for the control group. Six studies with a total of 1112 peri- and post-menopausal women met our inclusion criteria. The evidence from these RCTs does not consistently demonstrate an effect of black cohosh on menopausal symptoms; a beneficial effect of black cohosh on peri-menopausal women cannot be excluded. The efficacy of black cohosh as a treatment for menopausal symptoms is uncertain and further rigorous trials seem warranted.",

Recent evidences suggest AR extracts are also effective in protecting against postmenopausal bone loss. To determine whether AR has any direct anabolic effect on osteoblasts, we investigated the ethanolic extract of AR on bone nodule formation in mouse MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells. AR did not stimulate osteoblast proliferation. Rather, at high doses of 1000 ng/mL for 48 h, AR suppressed (7.2+/-0.9% vs. control) osteoblast proliferation. At 500 ng/mL, a significant increase in bone nodule formation was seen with Von Kossa staining. Using quantitative PCR analysis, AR was shown to enhance the gene expression of runx2 and osteocalcin. Co-treatment with ICI 182,780, the selective estrogen receptor antagonist, abolished the stimulatory effect of AR on runx2 and osteocalcin gene induction, as well as on bone nodule formation in MC3T3-E1 cells. This is a first report of the direct effect of AR on enhancement of bone nodule formation in osteoblasts, and this action was mediated via an estrogen receptor-dependent mechanism. The results provide a scientific rationale at the molecular level for the claim that AR can offer effective prevention of postmenopausal bone loss.",

DESIGN: This was a mechanistic study conducted in the same individuals of luteinizing hormone pulsatility with a saline/naloxone challenge (n = 6) and positron emission tomography with [C]carfentanil, a selective micro-opioid receptor radioligand (n = 5), before and after 12 weeks of unblinded treatment with a popular BC daily supplement. RESULTS: BC treatment for 12 weeks at a standard dose (Remifemin, 40 mg/day) had no effect on spontaneous luteinizing hormone pulsatility or estrogen concentrations. With naloxone blockade, there was an unexpected suppression of mean luteinizing hormone pulse frequency (saline vs naloxone = 9.0 +/- 0.6 vs 6.0 +/- 0.7 pulses/16 h; P = 0.056), especially during sleep when the mean interpulse interval was prolonged by approximately 90 minutes (saline night interpulse interval = 103 +/- 9 min vs naloxone night interpulse interval = 191 +/- 31 min, P = 0.03). There were significant increases in mu-opioid receptor binding potential in the posterior and subgenual cingulate, temporal and orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, and nucleus accumbens ranging from 10% to 61% across brain regions involved in emotional and cognitive function. In contrast, binding potential reductions of lesser magnitude were observed in regions known to be involved in the placebo response (anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortex). CONCLUSIONS: Using two different challenge paradigms for the examination of central opioid function, a neuropharmacologic action of BC treatment was demonstrated in postmenopausal women.",

DESIGN: This was a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 351 women, ages 45 to 55, with two or more vasomotor symptoms per day. Women were randomly assigned to (1) black cohosh, (2) a multibotanical containing black cohosh, (3) the same multibotanical plus dietary soy counseling, (4) HT, or (5) placebo. Women were ineligible if they had used HT in the previous 3 months or menopausal herbal therapies in the previous month. Data on vaginal cytology and dryness were collected (at baseline and 3 and 12 mo). Daily menstrual diaries were maintained by 313 women with a uterus, and abnormal bleeding was evaluated. Serum estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and steroid hormone-binding globulin were assessed (baseline and 12 mo) among 133 postmenopausal women. Gynecologic outcomes of the five groups were compared. RESULTS: The five groups did not vary in baseline vaginal cytology profiles, vaginal dryness, menstrual cyclicity, or hormone profiles. The HT group had a lower percentage of parabasal cells and vaginal dryness than the placebo group at 3 and 12 months (P < 0.05). Abnormal bleeding occurred in 53 of 313 (16.9%) women. There were no differences in frequency of abnormal bleeding between any of the herbal and placebo groups, whereas women in the HT group had a greater risk than those in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Among postmenopausal women, HT significantly decreased follicle-stimulating hormone and increased estradiol; none of the herbal interventions showed significant effects on any outcomes at any time point. CONCLUSION: Black cohosh, used alone or as part of a multibotanical product with or without soy dietary changes, had no effects on vaginal epithelium, endometrium, or reproductive hormones.",

While several clinical trials document the efficacy of BCE in alleviating menopausal symptoms, preclinical studies to determine how BCE works have yielded conflicting results. Part of this is because there is not a universally accepted method to standardize the dose of black cohosh triterpenes, the presumed active ingredients in the extract. Although the mechanism by which BCE relieves symptoms is unknown, several hypotheses have been proposed: it acts 1) as a selective estrogen receptor modulator, 2) through serotonergic pathways, 3) as an antioxidant, or 4) on inflammatory pathways. We found that while the most prominent triterpene in BCE, 23-epi-26-deoxyactein, suppresses cytokine-induced nitric oxide production in brain microglial cells, the whole BCE extract actually enhanced this pathway. A variety of activities have been reported for black cohosh and its compounds, but the absorption and tissue distribution of these compounds is unknown."

      "abstract": "Women's Health Initiative findings indicate that hormone replacement therapy may increase breast cancer and cardiovascular disease risk. Black cohosh extract (BCE) is a popular alternative that reduced menopausal symptoms in several clinical trials. Preclinical studies have addressed the estrogenic properties of BCE, with conflicting results. The estrogenic influence of BCE on the breast has not been investigated. Black cohosh is standardized to triterpenes, but the activity and mechanism of action of these compounds are unknown. The study goals were to determine 1) triterpene content of 2 commercially available BCE preparations and 2) the effect of BCE on circulating and breast-specific estrogenic markers. Two black cohosh preparations were analyzed for triterpene content. Postmenopausal women took BCE for 12 wk followed by a 12-wk washout. One BCE preparation contained trace amounts and another contained 2.5% triterpenes. Women taking BCE with 2.5% triterpenes experienced relief of menopausal symptoms, with reversion toward baseline after washout. BCE had no effect on estrogenic markers in serum and no effect on pS2 or cellular morphology in nipple aspirate fluid. Triterpene content in commercially available black cohosh preparations varies. BCE standardized to 2.5% triterpenes relieved menopausal symptoms without systemic or breast-specific estrogenic effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracts from the rhizome of Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh) are increasingly popular as herbal alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for the alleviation of postmenopausal disorders. However, the molecular mode of action and the active principles are presently not clear. Previously published data have been largely contradictory. We, therefore, investigated the effects of a lipophilic black cohosh rhizome extract and cycloartane-type triterpenoids on the estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. RESULTS: Both extract and purified compounds clearly inhibited cellular proliferation. Gene expression profiling with the extract allowed us to identify 431 regulated genes with high significance. The extract induced expression pattern differed from those of 17beta-estradiol or the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen. We observed a significant enrichment of genes in an anti-proliferative and apoptosis-sensitizing manner, as well as an increase of mRNAs coding for gene products involved in several stress response pathways. These functional groups were highly overrepresented among all regulated genes. Also several transcripts coding for oxidoreductases were induced, as for example the cytochrome P450 family members 1A1 and 1B1. In addition, some transcripts associated with antitumor but also tumor-promoting activity were regulated. Real-Time RT-PCR analysis of 13 selected genes was conducted after treatment with purified compounds - the cycloartane-type triterpene glycoside actein and triterpene aglycons - showing similar expression levels compared to the extract. CONCLUSION: No estrogenic but antiproliferative and proapoptotic gene expression was shown for black cohosh in MCF-7 cells at the transcriptional level. The effects may be results of the activation of different pathways. The cycloartane glycosides and - for the first time - their aglycons could be identified as an active principle in black cohosh.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a major age-related source of morbidity and mortality. Increased bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts is central to its pathogenesis. Cytokines, particularly RANKL and TNFalpha, are often increased under pathologic conditions, leading to enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Black cohosh (Actaea/Cimicifuga racemosa L), a popular herbal supplement for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, was recently shown to have the beneficial effect of preventing bone loss. Here, we demonstrate that 25-acetylcimigenol xylopyranoside (ACCX), a triterpenoid glycoside isolated from black cohosh, potently blocks in vitro osteoclastogenesis induced by either RANKL or TNFalpha. This blockage of osteoclastogenesis elicited by ACCX results from abrogation of the NF-kappaB and ERK pathways induced by either RANKL or TNFalpha, respectively. Importantly, this compound attenuates TNFalpha-induced bone loss in vivo. Therefore, ACCX represents a potential lead for the development of a new class of antiosteoporosis agents.",

It is thought to have multiple mechanisms of action, including potential phytoestrogenic properties. This has caused some concern about its use by patients with hormone-sensitive cancer. This paper will present the results of a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa [L.] Nutt.) in patients with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A critical assessment of clinical (n = 5) and preclinical (n = 21) studies of black cohosh and cancer (breast and prostate) to treat hot flashes and other related symptoms is presented. In addition, clinical studies, case reports, animal studies, and in vitro assessments of the safety of black cohosh for patients with hormonally sensitive cancers is summarized and interpreted. MAIN RESULTS: In general, the research assessing efficacy of black cohosh for the treatment of hot flashes in women with breast cancer is inconclusive. There is laboratory evidence of antiproliferative properties but no confirmation from clinical studies for a protective role in cancer prevention. Black cohosh seems to have a relatively good safety profile. Concerns about liver toxicity are inconclusive. With relevance to cancer patients, black cohosh also seems not to exhibit phytoestrogenic activity and is in fact possibly an inhibitor of tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: The use of black cohosh appears to be safe in breast cancer patients without risk for liver disease, although further research is needed in this and other populations.",

METHOD: Prospective, controlled open-label observational study of 6141 women at 1287 outpatient gynecologists in Germany. Subjects were treated with recommended doses of study therapies, with treatment chosen by the participating physicians. Patients were followed up for 6 months, optionally 12 months. The primary effectiveness variable was Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) subscore PSYCHE at Month 3 evaluated by ANCOVA. RESULTS: The treatment groups were comparable at baseline, excepting the main MRS score and the PSYCHE score (monotherapy: 0.31+/-0.22; combination therapy: 0.42+/-0.23). Reductions from baseline were seen with both regimens for all variables. The changes in the primary variable remained significantly different between groups (p<0.001) when adjusted for differences at baseline with the combination therapy being superior: from 0.37 (adjusted) to 0.25 (95% CI: 0.24-0.25) and 0.23 (95% CI: 0.22-0.23) at Month 3 in the monotherapy and combination-therapy groups, respectively. The improvement by both therapies was maintained at 6 and 12 months. The rate of possibly treatment-related adverse events was 0.16%, all non-serious. CONCLUSION: The results support the effectiveness and tolerability profiles of two Black cohosh-based therapies for menopausal symptoms in general practice. They were used differentially: the monotherapy for neurovegetative symptoms, the combination for patients with more pronounced mood complaints. The fixed combination of Black cohosh and St. John's wort was superior to Black cohosh alone in alleviating climacteric mood symptoms.",

METHOD: The randomized, double-blind, controlled 3-month study in 5 centers of 3 cities in China enrolled 244 menopausal patients aged 40-60 years and with a Kupperman Menopause Index (KMI)>or=15. The participants were assigned to either iCR corresponding to 40 mg crude drug/day (N=122) or tibolone 2.5mg/day (N=122) orally. The primary endpoint was the combination of the Mann-Whitney values (MWV) of the KMI and the frequency of adverse events (benefit-risk balance) at end of treatment (MWV>0.5 shows superiority; MWV>0.36 shows non-inferiority). RESULTS: KMI decreased from 24.7+/-6.1 to 11.2+/-6.2 and 7.7+/-5.8 (iCR) and to 11.2+/-7.2 and 7.5+/-6.8 (tibolone) at 4 and 12 weeks. This remarkable and clinically relevant improvement was similar in both treatment groups (MWV=0.47; 95% CI=0.39-0.54; p(non-inferiority)=0.002) showing statistical significant non-inferiority of iCR to tibolone. The KMI-responder rate was similar in both groups (84% and 85%). The safety evaluation showed for both groups a good safety and tolerability profile, however, there is a significant lower incidence of adverse events (p<0.0001) in favor of the herbal treatment. None of the postmenopausal iCR patients experienced vaginal bleeding in contrast to tibolone (17 cases). Breast and abdominal pain as well as leukorrhea was mostly observed in the tibolone group (p=0.015, p=0.008, p=0.002). No serious adverse event was observed in the iCR-group, however, two occurred in the tibolone-group. The benefit-risk balance for iCR was significantly (p=0.01) superior to tibolone (MWV=0.56; 95% confidence interval [0.51-0.62]). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of iCR (medicinal product Remifemin) is as good as tibolone for the treatment of climacteric complaints, even for moderate to severe symptoms, whereby iCR is clearly superior regarding the safety profile. This iCR containing medicinal product is an excellent option for treatment of climacteric complaints which has now for the first time been verified in Asian women.",

A total of 120 healthy women with menopausal symptoms were recruited to this prospective study with a follow-up period of 6 mo. They were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups and were treated with fluoxetine or black cohosh. After entry into the study, patients were examined at the first, second, third, and sixth months of the treatment period. The women kept diaries in which they reported the daily number and intensity of hot flushes and night sweats. In addition, at the beginning and end of the third month, they completed questionnaires consisting of a modified Kupperman Index, Beck's Depression Scale, and a RAND-36 Quality-of-Life Questionnaire. Statistically significant differences were noted in the Kupperman Index and Beck's Depression Scale at the end of the third month in both groups compared with baseline values. In the black cohosh group, the Kupperman Index decreased significantly compared with that in the fluoxetine group by the end of the third month. On the other hand, in the fluoxetine group, Beck's Depression Scale decreased significantly compared with that in the black cohosh group. Monthly scores for hot flushes and night sweats decreased significantly in both groups; however, black cohosh reduced monthly scores for hot flushes and night sweats to a greater extent than did fluoxetine. At the end of the sixth month of treatment, black cohosh reduced the hot flush score by 85%, compared with a 62% result for fluoxetine. By the sixth month of the study, 40 women had discontinued the study--20 (33%) in the fluoxetine group and 20 (33%) in the black cohosh group. Compared with fluoxetine, black cohosh is more effective for treating hot flushes and night sweats. On the other hand, fluoxetine is more effective in improvements shown on Beck's Depression Scale.",

METHODS: Steroid sulfatase (STS) activity was studied in normal breast tissue obtained from pre- and postmenopausal women undergoing reduction mammoplasty. STS protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Breast tissue was incubated in vitro without or with black cohosh (iCR) at concentrations ranging from 0.1mg/ml to 1 ng/ml. STS activity was evaluated by incubating homogenized breast tissue with [3H]-estrone sulfate, separating the formed products, estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2), by thin layer chromatography and measuring the amounts of E1 and E2 by scintillation counting. RESULTS: STS protein expression and enzymatic activity were detected in all specimens investigated. In all groups, significantly more E1 than E2 was produced. Local estrogen formation was decreased in premenopausal breast tissue by treatment with iCR at 0.1mg/ml (p<or=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: iCR decreases local estrogen formation in normal human breast tissue in vitro. This may contribute to the lack of hormonal effects of black cohosh in breast tissue observed in previous studies.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, 89 peri- or postmenopausal women experiencing climacteric symptoms were treated with St. John's wort and black cohosh extract (Gynoplus), Jin-Yang Pharm., Seoul, Korea) or a matched placebo for 12 weeks. Climacteric complaints were evaluated by the Kupperman Index (KI) initially and at 4 and 12 weeks following treatment. Vaginal maturation indices, serum estradiol, FSH, LH, total cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were measured before and after treatment. From the initial 89 participants, 77 completed the trial (42 in the Gynoplus group, 35 in the placebo group). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. Mean KI scores and hot flushes after 4 and 12 weeks were significantly lower in the Gynoplus group. Differences in superficial cell proportion were not statistically significant. HDL levels decreased in the control group from 60.20 +/- 16.37 to 56.63 +/- 12.67, and increased in the Gynoplus group from 58.32 +/- 11.64 to 59.74 +/- 10.54; this was statistically significant (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: Black cohosh and St. John's wort combination was found to be effective in alleviating climacteric symptoms and might provide benefits to lipid metabolism.",

To broaden observations, the anti-invasive effects of iCR and its two major fractions triterpene glycosides (TTG) and cinnamic acid esters (CAE) were tested in highly invasive MDA-MB 231 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of drugs upon the invasive potential of MDA-MB231 cells was studied in BD Biocoat Matrigel invasion chambers over a period of 24 h. RESULTS: The suppression of invasion reached 51.8% at 77.4 microg/ml of iCR, an extract concentration where 89% of MDA-MB231 cells were viable. TTG and CAE reduced cell invasion by 34% and 25.5%, respectively, at a dose of 5 microg/ml. The motility of cells was only moderately reduced. CONCLUSION: In this study iCR was found to suppress tumor cell invasion without affecting cell viability. This result together with the antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effect of iCR suggest its use as a secure agent in postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy with additional chemopreventive activity.",

METHODS: This pharmacoepidemiologic observational retrospective cohort study examined breast cancer patients treated at general, gynecological and internal facilities linked to a medical database in Germany. The main endpoint was disease-free survival following a diagnosis of breast cancer. The impact of treatment with iCR following diagnosis was analyzed by Cox-proportional hazards models, controlling for age and other confounders. RESULTS: Of 18,861 patients, a total of 1,102 had received an iCR therapy. The mean overall observation time was 3.6 years. Results showed that iCR was not associated with an increase in the risk of recurrence but associated with prolonged disease-free survival. After 2 years following initial diagnosis, 14% of the control group had developed a recurrence, while the iCR group reached this proportion after 6.5 years. The primary Cox regression model controlling for age, tamoxifen use and other confounders demonstrated a protractive effect of iCR on the rate of recurrence (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.69 0.99). This effect remained consistent throughout all variations of the statistical model, including subgroup analyses. TNM status was unknown but did not bias the iCR treatment decision as investigated separately. Hence, it was assumed to be equally distributed between treatment groups. Correlation analyses showed good internal and external validity of the database. CONCLUSION: An increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence for women having had iCR treatment, compared to women not treated with iCR is unlikely.",

      "abstract": "Non-steroidal as well as steroidal aromatase inhibitors are currently being discussed as alternatives to tamoxifen in the first-line treatment of patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Many of these women are in a postmenopausal state and additionally troubled by climacteric complaints. Naturally occurring symptoms like hot flushes and night sweats can be triggered or augmented by anti-hormonal drugs. At the aromatase molecule, steroidal inhibitors like exemestane and formestane compete with the hormonal precursors for the substrate binding site and inactivate the enzyme irreversibly. An isopropanolic extract of the rootstock of black cohosh (iCR), which is a common comedication of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer patients suffering from climacteric symptoms, contains triterpene glycosides and cinnamic acid esters, both of which possess structural similarities to steroids. We therefore tested a high dose of iCR, guaranteeing an effective uptake of 60 mg herbal substance per kg body weight and shown to influence rat bone and uterus, for putative interactions with two low dosing regimens of 3.5 mg or 5.0 mg formestane per animal and day. We chose a rat model of chemically induced breast cancer and evaluated tumor growth and serum estrogen levels. Compared to a tumor area of 1400 mm2 after 21 days of unopposed tumor growth, formestane treatment, irrespective of concomitant black cohosh application, significantly reduced neoplastic growth by 50%. Formestane also significantly reduced serum estrogen levels, an effect which was also not abolished by iCR. Therefore, in this experimental setting, when challenging two low doses of formestane with a high dose of iCR, our data do not raise concerns against combining aromatase inhibitors with black cohosh.",

Little is known about its effect on other physiologic parameters that could result in untoward events. This study examines the effect of black cohosh on lipids, fibrinogen, glucose and insulin. METHODS: Three hundred and fifty-one, 45-55 years old, peri or post-menopausal women experiencing vasomotor symptoms participated in a 3-month, double blind trial with randomization to: (1) black cohosh (160 mg daily); (2) multibotanical including black cohosh (200 mg daily); (3) multibotanical plus soy diet counseling; (4) conjugated equine estrogen .625 mg, with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5mg daily, for women with or without a uterus, respectively; (5) placebo. Baseline and month 3 total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (calculated), triglyceride, insulin, glucose, and fibrinogen serum concentrations were measured in 310 women. Baseline information was also collected on medical history, demographic characteristics, and diet. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the adjusted mean change from baseline to 3 months between the herbal groups and placebo in total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. Adjusted fibrinogen levels appear to increase in the multibotanical treatment group in comparison with the other herbal groups and placebo overall (P = .02), but there was no statistically significant difference in the pairwise test against placebo (P = .11).

OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of 3 herbal regimens and hormone therapy for relief of vasomotor symptoms compared with placebo. DESIGN: 1-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from May 2001 to September 2004. SETTING: Group Health, Washington State. PARTICIPANTS: 351 women age 45 to 55 years with 2 or more vasomotor symptoms per day; 52% of the women were in menopausal transition and 48% were postmenopausal. MEASUREMENTS: Rate and intensity of vasomotor symptoms (1 = mild to 3 = severe), and Wiklund Vasomotor Symptom Subscale. INTERVENTIONS: 1) Black cohosh, 160 mg daily; 2) multibotanical with black cohosh, 200 mg daily, and 9 other ingredients; 3) multibotanical plus dietary soy counseling; 4) conjugated equine estrogen, 0.625 mg daily, with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg daily; or 5) placebo. RESULTS: Vasomotor symptoms per day, symptom intensity, Wiklund Vasomotor Symptom Subscale score did not differ between the herbal interventions and placebo at 3, 6, or 12 months or for the average over all the follow-up time points (P > 0.05 for all comparisons) with 1 exception: At 12 months, symptom intensity was significantly worse with the multibotanical plus soy intervention than with placebo (P = 0.016). The difference in vasomotor symptoms per day between placebo and any of the herbal treatments at any time point was less than 1 symptom per day; for the average over all the follow-up time points, the difference was less than 0.55 symptom per day. The difference for hormone therapy versus placebo was -4.06 vasomotor symptoms per day for the average over all the follow-up time points (95% CI, -5.93 to -2.19 symptoms per day; P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The trial did not simulate the whole-person approach used by naturopathic physicians. Differences between treatment groups smaller than 1.5 Vasomotor symptoms per day cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSION: Black cohosh used in isolation, or as part of a multibotanical regimen, shows little potential as an important therapy for relief of vasomotor symptoms.

Because the opiate system in the brain is intimately associated with mood, temperature, and sex hormonal levels, the activity of black cohosh extracts at the human mu opiate receptor (hMOR) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was investigated. The 100% methanol, 75% ethanol, and 40% 2-propanol extracts of black cohosh effectively displaced the specific binding of [3H]DAMGO to hMOR. Further studies of the clinically used ethanol extract indicated that black cohosh acted as a mixed competitive ligand, displacing 77 +/- 4% [3H]DAMGO to hMOR (Ki = 62.9 microg/mL). Using the [35S]GTPgammaS assay, the action of black cohosh was found to be consistent with an agonist, with an EC50 of 68.8 +/- 7.7 microg/mL. These results demonstrate for the first time that black cohosh contains active principle(s) that activate hMOR, supporting its beneficial role in alleviating menopausal symptoms.",

This study compares the action of ethanolic extracts of black cohosh (BCE) and genistein on growth and enzyme activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-123 breast cancer cells. BCE inhibited growth at the two highest doses tested, i.e. 50 and 100 microg/ml, whilst genistein stimulated growth in the oestrogen receptor positive (ER(+)) MCF-7 cells, but at high doses it inhibited growth in both cell lines. BCE did not affect the conversion of androstenedione to oestradiol and only the highest doses (50 and 100 microg/ml) significantly inhibited the conversion of oestrone to oestradiol in MDA cells. In contrast, BCE induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the conversion of oestrone sulphate to oestradiol in both cell lines, whilst in human granulosa lutein (GL) cells enzyme activity was only inhibited at the highest dose of BCE. Genistein had no significant effect on enzyme activity in breast cancer cells and like BCE only the highest doses (10 and 50 microM) inhibited enzyme activity in human GL cells. In vivo genistein may have growth stimulatory effects on breast tissue but BCE not only inhibits growth but inhibits the conversion of oestrone sulphate to active oestradiol, considered by some, to be the preferred pathway of oestradiol synthesis in breast tissue.",

DESIGN: This was a prospective, open, uncontrolled drug safety study in which baseline status was compared with status after 6 months of treatment by blinded observers. A total of 74 women were treated with 40 mg black cohosh daily, and 65 women completed the study. Mammograms were performed, and breast cells were collected by percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsies at baseline and after 6 months. Mammographic density was quantified according to the Wolfe classification or a percentage scale. Breast cell proliferation was assessed using the Ki-67/MIB-1 monoclonal antibody. Safety was monitored by adverse event reporting, laboratory assessments, and measurement of the endometrium by vaginal ultrasound. RESULTS: None of the women showed any increase in mammographic breast density. Furthermore, there was no increase in breast cell proliferation. The mean change +/- SD in proportion of Ki-67-positive cells was -0.5% +/- 2.4% (median, 0.0; 95% CI = -1.32 to 0.34) for paired samples. The mean change in endometrial thickness +/- SD was 0.0 +/- 0.9 mm (median, 0.0). A modest number of adverse events were possibly related to treatment, but none of these were serious. Laboratory findings and vital signs were normal. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the isopropanolic extract of black cohosh does not cause adverse effects on breast tissue. Furthermore, our data do not indicate to any endometrial or general safety concerns during 6 months of treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate endometrial safety by assessment of endometrial biopsy samples and the tolerability and efficacy of the special Actaea or Cimicifuga racemosa extract (CR BNO 1055). DESIGN: Four hundred postmenopausal women with symptoms related to estrogen deficiency were enrolled into a prospective, open-label, multinational, multicenter study. Treatment duration (daily dose corresponds to 40 mg of herbal drug) was 52 weeks. To determine the probability of endometrial hyperplasia and more serious adverse endometrial outcome, the point estimator and upper limit of 95% CI were calculated. Descriptive statistics was used to assess the secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Endometrial safety has been proven because no case of hyperplasia or more serious adverse endometrial outcome occurred (point estimate: 0.0; upper limit of 95% CI: 0.011). Endometrial thickness, which was measured by endovaginal ultrasonography, did not show an increase. The number and intensity of hot flushes were markedly decreased. The dropout rate was less than 10%. The overall tolerability was good. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of endometrial proliferation and improvement of climacteric complaints as well as only few gynecologic organ-related adverse events are reported for the first time after a treatment period of 1 year. Due to the improved benefit:risk ratio, it must be assumed that the Cimicifuga racemosa special extract BNO 1055 is a safe alternative for treatment of climacteric complaints.",
