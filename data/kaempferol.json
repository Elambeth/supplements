      "abstract": "Excessive neuroinflammation resulting from chronic alcohol intake is an important risk factor for central nervous system injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of kaempferol (KAE) on alcohol-induced neural injury and its underlying mechanism. C57BL/6 N mice were employed to develop a binge-on-chronic alcohol exposure model, with different doses of KAE as an interventional drug for 6 weeks. Neuronal damage and microglial activation in the brain, as well as colonic tissue damage and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations, were systematically assessed. Additionally, Caco-2 cells were exposed to alcohol to induce intestinal epithelial injury in vitro. Chronic alcohol exposure let to significant neuronal damage in the cortex and hippocampus of mice. KAE treatment effectively attenuated microglial activation and reduced neuronal damage in the brains of alcohol-exposed mice. Analysis of colonic tissues revealed that KAE administration inhibited miRNA-122a expression, alleviated pathological damage, and enhanced occludin expression, thereby significantly lowing serum LPS concentrations in alcohol-fed mice. In vitro, KAE markedly decreased miRNA-122a expression and enhanced occludin levels in Caco-2 cells treated with alcohol. Furthermore, overexpression of miRNA-122a was found to diminish occludin protein production in Caco-2 cells, which was significantly counteracted by KAE treatment. KAE treatment enhanced intestinal barrier function to alleviate neuronal damage caused by microglial activation mediated by gut-derived LPS under alcohol expose. This effect of KAE was involved in the enhance of intestinal occludin expression by inhibiting the expression of miRNA-122a. This suggested that KAE had the potential to prevent alcohol-induced neurological damage."

      "abstract": "Intrauterine adhesion (IUA) is a disease caused by endometrial damage without effective treatments. Stem cell therapy has been initiated as a new attempt to repair and regenerate injured tissues. However, the therapeutic efficacy of stem cell therapy is limited. Kaempferol is a natural flavonoid with various beneficial effects. In this study, our goal is to investigate the roles of kaempferol combined with umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) in IUA. UCMSCs were collected from human umbilical cords. The multilineage differentiation potential of human UCMSCs was evaluated by Oil Red O staining, Alizarin Red S staining, and Alcian Blue staining. The phenotype profile of human UCMSCs was assessed by flow cytometry. CCK-8 and Transwell assays were performed to detect cell viability and migration. The IUA rat model was established. Histological changes were examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining and Masson staining. Gene expression was evaluated by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Kaempferol (10 μM) promoted the migration and proliferation of human UCMSCs in vitro. Additionally, kaempferol/UCMSCs combination treatment recovered endometrial injury and inhibited endometrial fibrosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition occurrence in IUA rat models. Mechanistically, kaempferol/UCMSCs combination treatment inhibited JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Kaempferol/UCMSCs combination treatment can promote the repair of damaged endometrium by decreasing endometrial fibrosis. The inactivation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway is greatly responsible for the protective effect of kaempferol/UCMSCs combination treatment."

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a disease with high morbidity and poor prognosis. The combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and cuproptosis are known to serve important roles in the treatment of GBM. However, targeting cuproptosis to treat GBM by combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine has not been extensively investigated. Therefore, the present study focused on the diagnosis and treatment of GBM based on cuproptosis. Through a bioinformatics approach, a cuproptosis‑related prognostic model was first constructed. Next, this prognostic model was found to be closely related to immune infiltration, DNA mutation and DNA methylation through multi‑omics analysis. The present study indicated the cell clusters in GBM tissues and the risk scores in each cluster based on single‑cell sequencing data derived from Gene Expression Omnibus. Notably, by screening the CellMiner database, EMD‑1204831 was found to exhibit a high correlation with the risk score. Next, through network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis, the risk score‑related gene collagen type XXII α1 chain (COL22A1) was identified as the target of kaempferol, which is the active component of Ginseng. Notably, kaempferol could decrease the proliferation of GBM cells by inhibiting COL22A1 expression in cell experiments. Finally, kaempferol and EMD‑1204831 had an obvious inhibitory effect on the growth of GBM and sensitized GBM to cuproptosis inducers via COL22A1 in cell and animal experiments. Overall, the present study revealed a cuproptosis‑related combined regimen for GBM.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a prevalent malignancy that poses significant risks to the health of women worldwide. The incidence and mortality rates of BC continue to be high, despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment, indicating a need for novel prevention strategies. Kaempferol (KAM) is a common dietary flavonoid with known antitumour properties, but its role in the chemoprevention of BC and the underlying mechanisms largely unexplored. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the chemopreventive effects of KAM on carcinogen-induced BC in vivo and in vitro and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: In this study, we used an N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU)-induced rat model of BC and 17β-oestradiol (E2)-treated MCF-10A cells to evaluate the chemopreventive effects of KAM on mammary tumorigenesis. The antioxidant capacity of KAM was assessed by measuring oxidative damage marker levels and antioxidant enzyme expression. Flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining were utilized to analyse cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. The core target of KAM was identified by network pharmacology and validated by molecular docking, MD simulation, CESTA, and BLI. KEGG enrichment analysis, molecular biology tests and the application of specific protein inhibitors were conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms modulated by KAM. RESULTS: In vivo, KAM inhibited the progression of mammary tumours and delayed pathological changes in the morphological structure of mammary gland cells to varying degrees. In vitro, KAM reduced cell viability, migration, and anchorage-independent growth while triggering cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in E2-treated MCF-10A cells. Furthermore, KAM increased cellular antioxidant capacity and attenuated E2-induced oxidative stress. Mechanistically, KAM directly interacted with Src and inhibited its phosphorylation, thus leading to PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition. Notably, the inhibition of E2-induced cell migration and anchorage-independent growth in vitro by Src- or PI3K/AKT pathway-specific inhibitors was not further enhanced when the cells were cultured with KAM. CONCLUSION: In summary, KAM targets the Src-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway to reduce oxidative stress and facilitate apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, thereby inhibiting mammary tumorigenesis. Our study is the first to identify Src kinase as a direct target of KAM in mammary tumorigenesis. These findings give significant perspectives on the potential application of KAM in BC chemoprevention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) plays a fundamental role in endogenous bone regeneration during periodontitis treatment, yet achieving consistent differentiation under inflammatory conditions remains clinically challenging. Kaempferol, a phytochemical flavonol, has demonstrated osteoprotective efficacy in osteoporosis and bone repair models. However, whether kaempferol exerts pro-osteogenic effects on PDLSCs within the pathologically complex microenvironment of periodontitis, and through what molecular mechanisms, remains unexplored. PURPOSE: This study aimed to systematically characterize the therapeutic efficacy of kaempferol in restoring osteogenic differentiation of human PDLSCs under inflammatory stress, and promoting bone regeneration in a mice periodontitis model, and elucidate novel molecular targets and downstream mechanisms mediating these regenerative actions. METHODS: An in vitro inflammatory microenvironment was established using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human PDLSCs to mimic periodontitis-induced osteogenic impairment. Osteogenic recovery was assessed through alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alizarin red S staining, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and Western blot analysis of osteogenesis-related markers (ALP, RUNX2, OSX, OPN). The bioinformatics, network pharmacology and siRNA transfection were performed to identify EphrinB2 as kaempferol's putative cellular target. Downstream PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathway activation was evaluated through phosphoprotein analysis. In vivo validation employed micro-CT quantification of alveolar bone loss and immunohistochemical profiling of pathways key proteins in a mice periodontitis model. RESULTS: Kaempferol dose-dependently rescued LPS-impaired osteogenic differentiation in human PDLSCs, especially at 10 μM, where kaempferol significantly reversed suppressed ALP activity, mineralized nodule formation, and transcriptional and protein expression of osteogenic markers (ALP, RUNX2, OSX, OPN). Mechanistically, kaempferol upregulated the key target EphrinB2 under inflammatory stress, thereby reactivating the downstream PI3K/Akt and p38 pathways. In periodontitis mice, kaempferol administration (10 mg/kg) significantly promoted the periodontal expression of OPN and EphrinB2, restored the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and P38, attenuating alveolar bone loss by 63.8 % (BV/TV: 72.4 % ± 2.07 vs. 44.2 % ± 3.19 in CON). CONCLUSION: Kaempferol could rescue PDLSCs' osteogenic differentiation and mitigates bone loss in periodontitis microenvironments by targeting EphrinB2 to activate PI3K/Akt and P38 pathways. This work underscores kaempferol's potential as a natural therapeutic for reversing pathological bone resorption and promoting periodontal regeneration.",

The changes in bone and liver tissue were observed through HE staining. Bone metabolism and inflammatory markers were quantitatively analyzed using RT-qPCR and ELISA. Changes in the YAP/NF-κB signaling pathway were detected through Western blot and immunofluorescence. In vitro, the activity and secretion levels of MC3 T3-E1-differentiated osteoblasts were assessed using CCK- 8 and ELISA. The effects of osteoblast-secreted factors on osteoclast-induced differentiation were analyzed using alizarin red staining, phalloidin staining, ELISA, TRAP staining, and SEM. Finally, the regulatory effects of kaempferol on the expression of bone homeostasis in osteoclasts were examined by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Kaempferol treatment improved trabecular bone structure, increased bone density, and modulated bone metabolism by enhancing OPG expression and suppressing TRAP, NFATC1, and RANKL levels. Kaempferol inhibited the activation of the NF-κB pathway and increased YAP expression, reducing inflammatory factors. In vitro, kaempferol promoted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited osteoclast activity. These effects were most pronounced at higher kaempferol doses and were associated with improved bone remodeling and reduced bone resorption. Kaempferol exhibits significant potential for osteoporosis treatment by regulating bone homeostasis, mitigating inflammation through modulating the YAP."

Magnesomes were prepared using varied amounts of phospholipid, magnesium sulfate and poloxamer 188, and evaluated on in-vitro and in-vivo levels. The prepared vesicles possessed nanosizes (112-625 nm), negative charges (-16 to -20 mV), and entrapment efficiency (80-96 %) with negligible changes in their colloidal properties after 3 months' storage. Magnesomes showed sustained release of kaempferol as well as superior permeability relative to drug solution. Radiolabeling of kaempferol with iodine-131 was successfully performed using electrophilic substitution. The superior brain uptake of intranasally delivered 131I-kaempferol-magnesomes containing 3.13 µg/20µl of kaempferol compared to intravenous and intranasal solutions was demonstrated employing biodistribution and pharmacokinetic tests conducted using Swiss Albino male mice. Brain to blood ratio of the intranasally administered kaempferol was significantly higher compared to intravenous injection showing uptake of 9.9 ± 0.3 % injected dose per gram organ at the first 5 min ensuring a rapid onset of action. The drug targeting efficiency and nose to brain direct transport percentages of 131I- kaempferol-magnesomes were 215.0 and 87.0 %, respectively with relative bioavailability of 810.24 ± 119.1 %. Accordingly, intranasal kaempferol-magnesomes showed effectiveness in brain targeting and could be beneficial for managing epileptic seizures."

Baicalin (BAI) and kaempferol (KAE) are known for their potent anti-inflammatory properties; however, their potential to alleviate demyelination and treat MS has rarely been rarely investigated. METHODS: Demyelination was induced in mice using cuprizone (CPZ), and behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate motor function recovery following treatment with BAI and KAE. Myelin loss was assessed using transmission electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses were employed to assess microglial activation and neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS) were utilized to identify molecular targets involved in the therapeutic effects of BAI and KAE. RESULTS: Both BAI and KAE significantly improved motor function and mitigated myelin loss in CPZ-treated mice. These compounds effectively inhibited CPZ-induced microglial activation and attenuated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Network pharmacology identified the STAT3 and NF-κB as potential targets of BAI and KAE. In vivo and in vitro validation further confirmed that both compounds significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-κB p65 proteins. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that BAI and KAE alleviate CPZ-induced demyelination by inhibiting STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby reduced microglial activation and alleviation of neuroinflammation.",

      "abstract": "Overexpression of Mcl-1 causes hepatocellular carcinoma resistance to Bcl-2 inhibitors, but there are currently no direct Mcl-1 inhibitors available for clinical application. Our previous research demonstrated that kaempferol from persimmon leaves (KPL) can sensitize ABT-199 to inhibit liver cancer cell proliferation. This study further explored the effect of KPL sensitizing ABT-199 on liver cancer cell apoptosis and its potential mechanisms. The inhibitory effects of KPL and ABT-199, both individually and in combination, on the proliferation of HepG2, Huh7, and HCCLM3 cells were evaluated. Cell apoptosis and mitochondrial morphology were assessed with flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. Apoptosis and changes in Mcl-1 protein expression were evaluated after siMcl-1 knockdown. Molecular docking simulations were used to analyze the interactions of KPL and ABT-199, both individually and in combination, with Mcl-1 protein. The effect of KPL on Mcl-1 stability was investigated with proteasome inhibitor MG132. The results demonstrated that KPL showed a strong sensitizing effect on ABT-199 (CI value < 1), enhanced liver cancer cell proliferation inhibition and increased apoptosis rate. Combined treatment led to mitochondrial fragmentation and swelling, and significantly reduced Mcl-1 expression. siMcl-1 interference resulted in little difference in apoptosis rates and Mcl-1 expression between the combination treatment and untreated groups. Molecular docking revealed that KPL increased the affinity of ABT-199 for Mcl-1, whereas MG132 prevented KPL from downregulating Mcl-1 expression. These findings suggest that KPL enhances ABT-199-induced apoptosis in HCC cells by targeting Mcl-1 protein through increasing the affinity between ABT-199 and Mcl-1, while also promoting Mcl-1 degradation by affecting post-translational modifications.",

Thus, this study attempts to evaluate the influence of kaempferol on epigenome modification in HeLa cells. Biochemical analysis for global DNA methylation-LINE 1, DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases), HAT (histone acetyl transferase), HDACs (histone deacetylases) and HMTs (histone methyltransferases) were examined with their transcript level expression through qPCR. Also, H3 and H4 histone modification marks were quantitated by an ELISA-based assay. Moreover, qPCR and protein profiler were performed to analyse the expression of migratory genes at both mRNA and protein levels, respectively, that was further substantiated through colony formation, invasion, and scratch wound assays. Finally, DNA methyl-sequencing was performed to analyse the promoter methylation of TSGs (tumour suppressor genes) and corroborated by analysing selected TSGs' expression. Kaempferol treatment did not alter the global DNA methylation-LINE 1 compared to untreated control, however, it reduced the expression and biochemical activities of DNMT and HDAC, which can be linked to their hypermethylation by kaempferol exposure. Concordant with the reduced expression of HMTs, HATs and other epi-enzymes, various histone H3 and H4 marks were also observed to be modulated. Kaempferol exposure led to promoter hypomethylation of various TSGs (such as WIF1, RUNX1, RARβ, SOX1), which subsequently led to enhanced expression at the mRNA level, which corresponds to their reactivation. Molecular studies were consistent with cell-based studies, which demonstrated a strong growth inhibitory and anti-migratory effect of kaempferol.

Kaempferol (KP), a natural flavonoid, has been shown to exhibit effectiveness in treating infection-induced lung injury. Methods: We applied network pharmacology to explore the underlying mechanisms of KP in treating P. aeruginosa pneumonia and further validated them through a mouse model of acute bacterial lung infection and an in vitro macrophage infection model. Results: The in vivo studies demonstrated that treatment with KP suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, and MIP-2, and attenuated the neutrophil infiltration and lesions in lungs, leading to an increased survival rate of mice. Further studies revealed that KP treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9 and diminished the phosphorylation of JNK, c-Jun, and NF-κB p65 in lungs in comparison to the mice without drug treatment. Consistently, the in vitro studies showed that pretreatment with KP reduced the activation of GSK3β, JNK, c-Jun, and NF-κB p65 and decreased the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages during P. aeruginosa infection. Conclusions: KP reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting GSK3β/JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways and NF-κB activation, which effectively mitigated the P. aeruginosa-induced acute lung inflammation and injury, and elevated the survival rates of mice."

      "abstract": "Allergic asthma is an inflammatory condition characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the expansion of mucus-producing cells. This research aimed to evaluate the impact of Kaempferol 3-O-gentiobioside (K3G), extracted from Sauropus spatulifolius Beille leaves, on inflammatory cytokine secretion and mucus overproduction in IL-13-stimulated airway epithelial cells (16HBE cells) and ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma mouse models. Studies have found that K3G significantly reduces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IgE, TNF-α, histamine, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) induced by IL-13. It also mitigating the expression of the mucin5AC (MUC5AC). Additionally, K3G also downregulated the expression of NLRP3, TLR4, p-IκBα, and p-P65 proteins. In an OVA-induced mouse asthma model, K3G treatment reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited the increase in mucus-secreting cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, exposure to IL-13 and OVA increased the expression of NOTCH signaling receptors in both 16HBE cells and lung tissues of the mice. K3G treatment effectively targeted NOTCH1 and inhibits activation of the NOTCH pathway. In conclusion, K3G alleviates asthma-related airway alterations by suppressing inflammatory cytokines and excessive mucus secretion via the NOTCH signaling pathway. These results indicate the therapeutic promise of K3G in treating allergic asthma.",

      "abstract": "Chronic liver inflammation is a major cause of death in patients with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which pose a serious health threat worldwide, and there is no effective anti-hepatic fibrosis drug. Kaempferol (KA), a flavonoid polyphenol extracted from many edible plants and traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor activities and has an ameliorating effect on liver fibrosis or other fibroproliferative diseases. However, the specific regulatory mechanism of KA-reversed macrophage M1 polarization is still obscure. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of KA on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis in mice through M1 polarization. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with CCl4 twice weekly to induce liver fibrosis. Male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 5): the oil group, the CCl4 group, the low-dose KA-treatment CCl4 group (50 mg/kg/day KA), and the high-dose KA-treatment CCl4 group (100 mg/kg/day KA). An equal amount of solvent was given to each group by intraperitoneal injection. The results indicated that KA decreased liver pathologic changes, hepatic macrophage recruitment, and serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Notably, it reduced the activation of M1-type macrophages in the liver. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines and genes associated with M1 macrophages, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, was also decreased. The core targets, signaling pathways, and possible mechanisms related to the M1 polarization of KA were analyzed by network pharmacology and molecular docking. Further analysis revealed that KA regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Finally, the results indicated that KA regulates M1 macrophage activation by modulating the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways. This study revealed that KA ameliorated liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis by inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization through the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, highlighting KA as a potential novel agent for the prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Chronic liver inflammation is a leading cause of mortality in patients with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, presenting a significant global health threat. Kaempferol, as a traditional Chinese medicine, effectively suppresses M1 polarization of macrophages through the mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor κB signaling pathway, thereby ameliorating liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. These findings underscore the potential of kaempferol as an innovative therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis."

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke represents a critical global health challenge, resulting in significant mortality and disability worldwide, yet there are limited effective treatment options currently available. While the intricate molecular pathways underlying the onset and progression of ischemic stroke are multifaceted, relying on a single therapeutic approach is unlikely to yield effective treatment for this complex disease. Therefore, it is crucial to explore efficient strategies that employ multifaceted targeting and address the multifarious pathological processes to overcome the challenges associated with ischemic brain injury. In recent times, natural plant-derived compounds have garnered significant interest as promising neuroprotective agents for the management of neurological conditions, including ischemic stroke. This study investigates the possible neuroprotective properties of kaempferol, a naturally occurring flavonoid compound, in mitigating the detrimental consequences of cerebral ischemic events. The findings from the reviewed preclinical studies suggest that kaempferol exhibits significant neuroprotective potential as a multifaceted therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke. Its efficacy stems from a combination of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, which collectively mitigate ischemic stroke-induced brain injury. While these results are promising, clinical studies are essential to validate kaempferol's therapeutic viability for ischemic stroke patients."

      "abstract": "Kaempferol is a flavonoid widely found in fruits and vegetables. Our previous studies have shown that kaempferol has a good inhibitory effect on colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo, significantly inhibiting proliferation and inducing cycle arrest and apoptosis. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a branch of glucose catabolism, that provides the raw material ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) for biosynthesis for the rapid proliferation of tumor cells and is closely related to DNA damage. DNA damage has been shown to play an important role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, we speculate whether kaempferol exerts the antitumor effect by inducing DNA damage. Herein we actually found that kaempferol treatment induced DNA damage, as indicated by increased γH2AX expression and comet assay. Furthermore, kaempferol reduced R5P production by inhibiting the nonoxidative PPP, while supplementation with nucleosides rescued DNA damage. Mechanistically, kaempferol upregulates the expression of microRNA-195/497 (miR-195/497) and then suppresses PFKFB4 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 4) expression by directly binding to its 3'-UTR, thereby inhibiting the expression of transketolase (TKT) and transaldolase (TALDO), key enzymes in the nonoxidative PPP. These data uncover new targets and pathways for the action of kaempferol and lay the foundation for its development as an adjuvant drug for the treatment of colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "Melanocyte (MC) death represents the basic pathological change of vitiligo. Kaempferol (Kae) is one of the main active ingredients of Tribulus terrestris, which is a commonly used Chinese medicine in the treatment of vitiligo. However, it remains unclear whether Kae can improve MC death, and hence relevant mechanisms need to be further explored. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of Kae on MC death and relevant mechanisms. The targets of Kae and the differential genes of vitiligo were screened based on different databases. Besides, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the common target of Kae and vitiligo was constructed to further identify the \"keycluster\" genes of the drug-disease interaction (DDI) network. In addition, the enrichment analysis based on Gene Ontology (GO), Disease Ontology (DO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was performed on the \"keycluster\" genes. Based on the network pharmacological results, it was found that Kae may ameliorate MC death through the ferroptosis pathway. Hence, the ferroptosis model of human primary epidermal melanocyte 1 (HEM-1) was induced by RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) and then co-cultured with Kae. Moreover, the role of Kae in MC ferroptosis was investigated by detecting the changes in mitochondrial morphology and functions, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron ions, the protein expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and antioxidant activities. Finally, si-GPX4 was used to silence the ferroptosis core protein GPX4 to re-examine the above indicators, thus verifying relevant mechanisms. The network pharmacology results showed that Kae was responsive to oxidative stress and ROS. The treatment of vitiligo by Kae mainly involved pigmentation, melanin metabolic processes, and such signaling pathways as melanogenesis, ferroptosis, and tyrosine metabolism. The in vitro experiment results indicated that Kae can effectively improve RSL3-induced HEM-1 ferroptosis, including alleviating mitochondrial damage, decreasing the level of ROS and iron ions, and up-regulating the expression of GPX4 and antioxidants. After silencing GPX4, the protective effect of Kae against HEM-1 ferroptosis was attenuated. Our study concluded that Kae can reduce RSL3-induced ferroptosis in HEM-1, and its mechanism is related to the regulation of the expression of the ferroptosis pathway protein GPX4. These findings are expected to provide novel insights into the treatment of vitiligo.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to utilize a systematic network pharmacology approach to explore the active components, targets, and pathways associated with the efficacy of Shiwei Hezi pill (SHP) in treating renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (RIRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized online databases to identify common targets of SHP and RIRI. Functional annotation of genes using the Gene Ontology (GO) and enrichment analysis of pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed using bioinformatics websites. Cytoscape was utilized to generate and visualize protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We employed specialist software to conduct molecular docking analysis on crucial constituents and targets in order to validate the interaction patterns between core ingredients and essential targets. RESULTS: We screened 54 ingredients with good bioavailability in SHP and identified 204 shared targets between SHP and RIRI. Our data suggests that SHP may primarily target TNF, IL6, GAPDH, MMP9, PTGS2, and MMP6 in the therapeutic management of RIRI. The GO enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment show that the mechanism of SHP treatment for RIRI involves multiple biological processes and signaling pathways. The molecular docking indicates that the three most potent active components of SHP (quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin) have a strong likelihood of binding to TNF, IL6, GAPDH, MMP9, and PTGS2 with a high degree of affinity. CONCLUSION: This is the first exploration of the potential mechanism of Tibetan medicine formula SHP in treating RIRI using network pharmacology. Our research indicates that the various components of SHP could act on multiple targets and signaling pathways associated with RIRI. The findings in this study provide a theoretical basis and a novel method for the clinical therapy of RIRI."

PEVs can be readily endocytosed due to their lipid bilayer membrane and nanoscale structure, enhancing the bioavailability and efficacy of their therapeutic effects. PEVs also contain various trophic factors that enhance their effectiveness as therapeutic agents. Given that nanomedicine provides benefits over traditional treatments for eye diseases by surpassing physical ocular barriers, PEVs combined with the anti-angiogenic agent, kaempferol (KM), were assessed for their capacity to inhibit abnormal blood vessel formation in the cornea. Characterization of the nanoparticles suggested the successful preparation of KM-loaded PEVs (PEV-KM) with a mean diameter of approximately 160 nm and an encapsulation efficiency of around 61 %. PEV-KM was effectively internalized into human vascular endothelial cells, resulting in inhibited function, as evidenced by lower wound closure rates, decreased tube formation capacity, and downregulation of angiogenesis-related gene expression. Moreover, prolonged ocular retention was observed following the topical application of PEV and PEV-KM in mouse eyes. In an alkali-burned corneal neovascularization (CoNV) mouse model, PEV (1 %) was found to decrease vessel formation in the injured cornea. However, the combination of PEV and KM (1 % PEV with KM 6 μg/mL) showed an even stronger effect in inhibiting CoNV and decreasing the expression of proangiogenic and inflammatory cytokines. Overall, our data suggests that the topical administration of PEVs, either alone or alongside KM (PEV-KM), is a promising therapy for the management of CoNV.",

This study endeavors to elucidate the in vivo metabolism of Kae and its potential to modulate the interplay between bile acids (BAs) and gut microbiota (GM). After Kae administration, we analyzed pharmacokinetics, BA levels, and drug metabolic enzymes (DMEs) amount using LC-MS/MS. Subsequently, we checked the gene and protein expression with qRT-PCR and western blot and studied the changes in GM using 16S rRNA sequencing, accompanying in-depth data analysis. Finally, molecular docking was employed to explore Kae's interaction with the Farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Kae enhances its own absorption and metabolic circulation in vivo by upregulating the UDP-Glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) expression. Furthermore, Kae significantly suppressed the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) while concurrently elevating the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) expression, by activating the liver FXR, a nuclear transcription factor involved in the regulation of CYPs and UGTs enzymes. For BA analysis, Kae induced the upregulation of tauro-BAs by attenuating the activity of bile salt hydrolases (BSH), which correlated with shifts in the GM composition. Specifically, Kae increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Bacteroides acidifaciens and Bifidobacterium choerinum, while reduced populations of species associated with BSH deconjugation. The study indicates that Kae may serve as a prebiotic, modulating the BA-GM interaction to confer nutritional and therapeutic advantages."

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition in which degeneration mostly occurs in the dopamine (DA)-producing neurons within the substantia nigra in the midbrain. As a result, individuals with this condition suffer from progressively worsening motor impairment because of the resulting DA deficiency, along with an array of other symptoms that, over time, force them into a completely debilitating state. As an age-related disease, PD has only risen in prevalence over the years; thus, an emphasis has recently been placed on discovering a new treatment for this condition that is capable of attenuating its progression. The gut microbiota has become an area of intrigue among PD studies, as research into this topic has shown that imbalances in the gut microbiota (colloquially known as gut dysbiosis) seemingly promote the primary etiologic factors that have been found to be associated with PD and its pathologic progression. With this knowledge, research into PD treatment has begun to expand beyond synthetic pharmaceutical compounds, as a growing emphasis has been placed on studying plant-derived polyphenolic compounds, namely flavonoids, as a new potential therapeutic approach. Due to their capacity to promote a state of homeostasis in the gut microbiota and their long-standing history as powerful medicinal agents, flavonoids have begun to be looked at as promising therapeutic agents capable of attenuating several of the pathologic states seen amidst PD through indirect and direct means. This review article focuses on three flavonoids, specifically epigallocatechin-3-gallate, quercetin, and kaempferol, discussing the mechanisms through which these powerful flavonoids can potentially prevent gut dysbiosis, neuroinflammation, and other molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of PD, while also exploring their real-world application and how issues of bioavailability and potential drug interactions can be circumvented or exploited."

It was demonstrated that the liposomal hydrogel of kaempferol had ex vivo and in vivo antioxidant activities, which could effectively inhibit the inflammatory response and oxidative stress and, thus, showed significant efficacy in the treatment of acute eczema. In the acute eczema model, kaempferol liposome hydrogel significantly improved the skin condition of mice by reducing the symptoms of skin redness, swelling, and itching. The experimental results showed that the hydrogel was rapidly absorbed into the skin after application and continued to release the drug to maintain its efficacy for a longer period of time. In addition, the kaempferol liposome hydrogel also showed good physicochemical stability and was not easily discolored or separated, making it suitable for long-term use. As an innovative drug carrier for the treatment of acute eczema, the kaempferol liposome hydrogel shows good application prospects and provides a new treatment option for eczema patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of a sustained-release composite containing gelatin methacryloyl (Gel) and kaempferol (Ka, K) on experimental periodontitis symptoms in rats. METHODS: Forty 6-week-old male rats were randomly assigned to four treatment groups in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment: Control group (C), periodontitis model group (M), Gel alone group (G), and Gel_Ka composite-treated group (G_K). Treatment effects on the periodontal status of bilateral maxillary second molars in each rat group were assessed by micro-CT imaging and histology. Immunohistochemistry staining was employed to examine the effects on expression levels of inflammatory factors IL-6 and MMP9 (associated with M1 macrophages) and of the anti-inflammatory factor CD206 (associated with M2 macrophages). Additionally, treatment effects on oral and intestinal microbial communities were analyzed through 16S rDNA sequencing. RESULTS: Local injection treatment with the G_K composite hydrogel effectively suppressed alveolar bone resorption and reduced periodontal attachment loss and inflammation infiltration in rats with periodontitis. It reduced the expression of inflammatory factors MMP9 and IL-6 but increased the anti-inflammatory factor CD206, and it also increased the abundance of gut microbial communities producing short-chain fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Local treatment with the sustained-release G_K hydrogel composite demonstrates a substantial antiperiodontitis effect in rats by locally attenuating inflammation and is associated with enhancing the microbial composition of intestinal flora, thus aiding in mitigating the inflammatory progression of experimental periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "Repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene are a frequent cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Considerable progress has been made in identifying C9ORF72-mediated disease and resolving its underlying etiopathogenesis. The contributions of intrinsic mitochondrial deficits as well as chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress to the development of the C9ORF72-linked pathology are well established. Nevertheless, to date, no cure or effective therapy is available, and thus attempts to find a potential drug target, have received increasing attention. Here, we investigated the mode of action and therapeutic effect of a naturally occurring dietary flavanol, kaempferol in preclinical rodent and human models of C9ORF72-ALS. Notably, kaempferol treatment of C9ORF72-ALS human patient-derived motor neurons/neurons, resolved mitochondrial deficits, promoted resiliency against severe ER stress, and conferred neuroprotection. Treatment of symptomatic C9ORF72 mice with kaempferol, normalized mitochondrial calcium uptake, restored mitochondria function, and diminished ER stress. Importantly, in vivo, chronic kaempferol administration ameliorated pathological motor dysfunction and inhibited motor neuron degeneration, highlighting the translational potential of kaempferol. Lastly, in silico modelling identified a novel kaempferol target and mechanistically the neuroprotective mechanism of kaempferol is through the iP3R-VDAC1 pathway via the modulation of GRP75 expression. Thus, kaempferol holds great promise for treating neurodegenerative diseases where both mitochondrial and ER dysfunction are causally linked to the pathophysiology.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) remains a major challenge in clinical treatment due to its multivariate pathology. Developing an oral formulation that encapsulates and delivers multiple active ingredients to target colon tissues by suppressing intestinal inflammation and restoring the intestinal barrier is crucial for effectively treating UC. Here, we developed rhubarb-derived nanovesicles (RNs) and a supramolecular hydrogel platform formed by furfural-functionalized chitosan-mannose polymer and synthesized 3-maleimide HP-β-CD, with kaempferol (Kae) integrated into the hydrophobic cavity. The hydrogel's cross-linking network effectively encapsulates RNs, forming the Kae/CMCHD@RNs system. Rheology, SEM, TGA, degradation behavior, in vitro drug release, and a macrophage-targeted permeability test were performed. The results indicate that the hydrogel utilizes pH/enzyme sensitivity to ensure sustained release in the colon, while also facilitating targeted delivery to macrophages. In vivo imaging further reveals a prolonged local drug retention time in the colon. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate RNs and Kae exhibit synergistic therapeutic effects for UC, including inflammation reduction, oxidative stress alleviation, M1-to-M2 macrophage repolarization, and restoration of the intestinal barrier. Consequently, this study underscores the potential of Kae/CMCHD@RNs as a promising therapeutic approach for managing UC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal Osteoporosis (PMOP) is characterized by decreased bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, leading to increased fracture risk. Current treatments often have adverse effects, necessitating safer alternatives. Kaempferol, a flavonoid identified as a key active component of the traditional Chinese medicine Yishen Gushu formula, has shown promise in improving bone health, but its mechanisms in PMOP treatment remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of kaempferol in the treatment of PMOP. METHODS: A bilateral ovariectomized (OVX) rat model was established to simulate PMOP. Sixty female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: Sham operation, OVX control, OVX with alendronate (ALN), and OVX with kaempferol at doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg. Treatments were administered orally once daily for 12 weeks. Assessments included Bone Mineral Density (BMD), trabecular microarchitecture via histopathology, organ morphology, organ indices, and serum levels of bone metabolism markers (TRACP-5b, BALP, ALP, Ca, P, and Fe) as well as liver and kidney function indicators (ALT, AST, CREA, and urea). Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics analyses were conducted on femur samples to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Key DEPs were validated using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), immunohistochemistry, and molecular docking. RESULTS: Kaempferol significantly improved BMD and enhanced trabecular microarchitecture in OVX rats in a dose-dependent manner, comparable to ALN, without causing hepatic, renal, or estrogen- like side effects. Serum bone metabolism markers were normalized with kaempferol treatment. Proteomic analysis identified 902 DEPs associated with kaempferol treatment, involved in processes such as bone remodeling, skeletal system development, and osteoclast function. Key signaling pathways affected included NF-κB, PI3K-AKT, and HIF-1. Notably, kaempferol downregulated five key DEPs-Rac2, Ddb1, Cdc42, Rpl19, and Hist2h4-in the femur, which are crucial for osteoclast resorptive activity, migration, adhesion, and cell cycle progression. CONCLUSION: Kaempferol exerts therapeutic effects on PMOP by inhibiting key proteins involved in osteoclast function, thereby reducing bone resorption and promoting bone health. These findings suggested that kaempferol is a potential safer alternative for PMOP treatment. Further research is recommended to explore its clinical applications and elucidate detailed mechanisms."

Current treatments are being re-evaluated, prompting interest in naturally occurring compounds like kaempferol, a flavonoid prevalent in fruits and vegetables, for their anti-inflammatory properties. This study explores the therapeutic potential of kaempferol, focusing on its ability to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines and its broader effects on inflammatory signaling pathways. Comprehensive reviews of in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. Kaempferol effectively inhibits the production of key inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and enzymes such as COX-2 and iNOS, while also targeting oxidative stress pathways like Nrf2 activation. The compound demonstrated protective effects in various inflammatory conditions, including sepsis, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune conditions, by modulating pathways such as NF-κB, MAPK, and STAT. Despite its promise, kaempferol's clinical application faces challenges related to its bioavailability and stability, underscoring the need for advanced formulation strategies. These findings position kaempferol as a promising candidate for anti-inflammatory therapy, with the potential to improve patient outcomes across a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Further clinical studies are required to validate its efficacy, optimize dosage, and address pharmacokinetic limitations.",

In recent years, there have been increasing reports on viral infection-induced Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with high rates of disability and fatality. Therefore, in order to search for effective peripheral nerve injury repair drugs, we used rats with experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) as the typical animal model for GBS, and implemented Kae treatment intervention on EAN rats. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) were utilized to detect the changes of inflammatory factors and signaling pathway proteins in peripheral nerve of rats. The impact of Kae on peripheral nerve damage in EAN rats was evaluated in multiple dimensions by clinical symptom score and neuroelectrophysiology examination, and the protective impact and mechanism of Kae on peripheral nerve injury were revealed. Our results showed that Kae increased the expression of sciatic myelin basic protein (MBP), decreased the expression of peripheral nerve macrophage infiltration and inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, and down-regulated the expression levels of TNFR1. Additionally, it suppressed the activation of the JNK and p38 pathways. It can alleviate sciatic nerve symptoms and pathological injury in EAN rats. Therefore, we believe that Kae can be used as an adjunct drug in the treatment of GBS.",

Plants can be a cost-effective source of flavonoids like quercetin and kaempferol with anti-diabetic properties. METHODOLOGY: We aimed to assess the antidiabetic potential of leaves of Brassica oleracea cvs. Green Sprout and Marathon. Further, flavonoid contents were measured in broccoli leaves grown under light and dark conditions. The methanolic extracts of Green Sprout (GSL-M) and Marathon (ML-M) were first evaluated in vitro for their α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory potential and then for antidiabetic activity in vivo in alloxan-induced diabetic rat models. RESULTS: Treatment with plant extracts promoted the reduced glutathione (GSH) content and CAT, POD, and SOD activities in the pancreas, liver, kidney, heart, and brain of diabetic rats, whereas lowered lipid peroxidation, H2O2, and nitrite concentrations. The histopathological studies revealed the protective effect of plant extracts at high dose (300 mg/kg), which could be due to broccoli's rich content of chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and kaempferol. Strikingly, etiolated leaves of broccoli manifested higher levels of quercetin and kaempferol than green ones. The putative role of an ABC transporter in the accumulation of quercetin and kaempferol in etiolated leaves was observed as evaluated by qRT-PCR and in silico analyses. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study shows a strong link between the antidiabetic potential of broccoli due to the presence of chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and kaempferol and the role of an ABC transporter in their accumulation within the vacuole."

Kaempferol, a flavonol abundant in various foods, exhibits diverse pharmacological effects. This study investigated the potential targets of kaempferol for treating skin flap ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury through network pharmacology and molecular docking, followed by in vivo validation. Using SwissTargetPredict, PubChem, SymMap V2, and GeneCards databases, 174 potential target proteins of kaempferol were identified. KEGG and GO enrichment analyses, performed using R software, indicated that kaempferol promotes skin flap survival by modulating ferroptosis, TNF-α, and NF-κB signalling pathways. Molecular docking demonstrated stable binding between kaempferol and key proteins, including SIRT1 and NRF2. In vivo, a McFarlane skin flap model was established in Sprague-Dawley rats. Kaempferol treatment improved flap survival, enhanced perfusion areas and distal arteriole visualisation, and increased blood flow in the flap. Furthermore, kaempferol reduced neutrophil infiltration, alleviated oxidative stress, improved mitochondrial morphology and function, and inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that kaempferol inhibited ferroptosis and inflammation while promoting flap survival. Mechanistically, kaempferol was found to activate SIRT1-mediated HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB and NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 pathways, thereby promoting skin flap survival and mitigating I/R injury.",

Rats were randomly divided into five groups: control group, model group, low-dose KAE group, medium-dose KAE group, and high-dose KAE group. An IDD model was established by needle puncture of the caudal intervertebral discs. Four weeks post-surgery, the rats were administered KAE via gavage for 8 consecutive weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) was performed, and samples were collected. In vitro, an inflammation model of nucleus pulposus cells(NPCs) induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-α) was constructed. Anisomycin was used to activate the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. NPCs were divided into blank, model, KAE, agonist, and KAE + agonist groups. After 1 day of treatment, cell proliferation activity was assessed using the CCK-8. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blot, and mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining, and immunofluorescence staining was used to detect type Ⅱ collagen and matrix metalloproteinase 3(MMP3). In vivo results indicated significant improvement in the degree of IDD in the treatment groups compared to the model group, with the medium-dose group showing more pronounced therapeutic effects than the low-and high-dose groups. In vitro results demonstrated that KAE treatment significantly enhanced NPC proliferation activity, down-regulated the expression levels of Bcl-2-associated X protein(Bax), interleukin-6(IL-6), interleukin-17A(IL-17A), MMP3, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5, and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK pathway-related proteins. Activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway by anisomycin reduced the therapeutic effects of KAE. The study concluded that KAE could improve the proliferation activity of degenerated NPCs, reduce inflammation levels, and slow the progression of IDD in rats, and the mechanism was likely related to the regulation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the therapeutic effects of kaempferol (Kae) on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was established using collagen II to induce RA. Mice were treated with Kae at a dose of 25 or 50 mg/kg/day via gavage. Pathological changes in the ankle joint were analyzed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to measure the levels of inflammatory factors. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to assess the expression of genes associated with the balance of regulatory T (Treg)/T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Flow cytometry was utilized to determine the Treg/Th17 ratio. Furthermore, these techniques were employed to evaluate the impact of miR-34a and Foxp3 dysregulation on cellular functions in RA under the influence of Kae. Dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to analyze the binding of miR-34a to Foxp3. RESULTS: Treatment with Kae led to a downregulation of receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) and IL-17 expression, and an upregulation of Foxp3, IL-10, and TGF-β expression in CIA mice. Kae intervention inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Kae treatment suppressed the expression of miR-34a, which was identified as a target of miR-34a. Finally, Kae regulated Treg/ Th17 balance-related genes and cellular inflammation through the miR-34a/Foxp3 axis. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that Kae effectively ameliorates CIA in mice by modulating the Treg/Th17 balance and related genes via the miR-34a/Foxp3 axis. These findings suggest that Kae may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of RA and for restoring immune homeostasis.",

The neutralizing capacity of kaempferol has been reported against some medically significant snake venoms with exception of N. haje venom (NhV). This current study assessed the neutralizing profile of kaempferol against toxicities induced by NhV using in vitro and in vivo methods. In in vitro, NhV induced wide spectrum of toxic biological activities with substantial increase in hemorrhagic, anticoagulating, and hemolytic effects. Likewise in the in vivo study, the venom caused hematological disorders by inducing acute anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leucopenia in envenomed rats. Also, the venom caused detrimental effect on the antioxidant defense system of the brain through significant (P < 0.05) elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite (NIT), and suppression of reduce glutathione (GSH) antioxidant, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione transferase (GST) enzymes. Additionally, the levels of neurotoxicity biomarkers, monoamine oxidase (MAO) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were significantly (P < 0.0.5) enhanced by NhV in the brain of envenomed rats. Severe pathohistological effects were observed in brain tissues of the envenomed rats. However, kaempferol substantially (P < 0.05) inhibited the NhV-induced biological activities, normalized the hematological disorders, enhanced antioxidants system functions, and significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed the levels of neurotoxicity biomarkers and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Severe structural alterations observed in the brain tissues were ameliorated after kaempferol treatment. Further exploration of kaempferol could lead to the development of an alternative therapy for treatment of N. haje envenoming.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kaempferol (KF), the main active ingredient in identifying the authenticity of safflower, has a variety of pharmacological activities and neuroprotective effects. However, the mechanism of KF in the treatment of epilepsy remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of KF on epilepsy and its related mechanisms. METHODS: Network pharmacology was used to explore the targets and mechanisms of safflower antiepileptic action. The protective effect of KF on epilepsy was assessed in the behavior and tissues of epileptic mice. Additionally, the impact of KF on the excitability and calcium transients of rat cortical neurons and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionicacid receptor (AMPAR) were investigated using patch clamp and calcium imaging techniques. RESULTS: Network pharmacology indicated safflower could be involved in calcium signaling pathways and calcium channel inhibitor activity. Experimental validation demonstrated that KF delayed seizure onset and mitigated neuronal damage in the prefrontal cortex of mice. It also reduced neuronal excitability, as indicated by action potential parameters, and suppressed Glutamate (Glu)-induced calcium transients. In tsA201 cells, KF inhibited AMPAR-mediated currents, suggesting a role in regulating [Ca2+]i homeostasis. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that KF's anticonvulsant properties may arise from its neuroprotection against cell injury, edema, and necrosis, its reduction of neuronal hyperexcitability, and its prevention of calcium-induced cytotoxicity, potentially involving AMPAR modulation. This study positions KF as a promising candidate for epilepsy therapy, offering a scientific foundation for its clinical investigation.",

Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS) can prevent prostate cancer metastasis caused by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), but its active ingredients and molecular mechanism remain unelucidated. AIM OF STUDY: This study aims to explore the potential targets and molecular mechanisms of CSS in the treatment of emotional stress-aggravated metastasis of prostate cancer. RESULTS: Stress induces nuclear translocation of GR, initiating the transcription of PER1, which leads to an enhanced lipid metabolism and decreased secretion of α2M in BMDMs. CSS, a classical Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula for alleviating depression, can improve prostate cancer metastasis caused by CUMS. Of the active ingredients in CSS, kaempferol demonstrated the highest potency for enhancing α2M secretion in BMDMs and inhibiting prostate cancer cell migration. Kaempferol also inhibited nuclear translocation of GR and the GR/PER1 pathway in Per1-overexpressed BMDMs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that emotional stress-aggravated prostate cancer growth and metastasis rely on the GR/PER1 pathway and lipid metabolism, as the suppression of this pathway ultimately leads to an increase in α2M secretion in BMDMs and inhibition of PC-3 cell metastasis.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic age-related lung disease with a high mortality rate. Kaempferol (KMP), an active ingredient in common plants and foods with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties, has been shown to be effective against fibrotic diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the treatment of IPF with KMP remain unclear. Therefore, IPF mice were established by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (BLM) to explore the efficacy and underlying mechanism of KMP in the treatment of IPF. We found that KMP improved the body weight changes of BLM-induced IPF mice, alleviated inflammatory infiltration and collagen deposition, and decreased the expression levels of hydroxyproline, α-SMA, Col3a1, Mmp2, Timp1, Vim, Fn, TNF-α, TGF-β1, IL-6 and IL-8, while up-regulating the expression E-cadherin in lung tissues. The transcriptomic results showed that KMP may exert therapeutic effects against IPF by regulating the PPARG/TNC signaling pathway to reduce extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Interestingly, ROC curve analysis suggested that TNC and PPARG had good diagnostic performance for IPF, and TF prediction revealed that PPARG is an important upstream gene regulating TNC, and the IF experiment confirmed the co-localization of TNC and PPARG. Molecular docking showed that KMP bound well to PPARG and TNC, and IF results revealed that KMP significantly reduced the interaction between PPARG and TNC. Furthermore, RT-PCR, WB, IHC and IF experiments confirmed that KMP elevated the expression of PPARG and inhibited the expression of TNC, thus inhibiting the ECM-receptor interaction pathway and ultimately serving as a therapeutic treatment for IPF mice. These findings revealed that KMP reduced inflammatory infiltration and collagen deposition in the lungs of IPF mice and that the PPARG/TNC signaling pathway may be an important mechanism for the treatment of IPF with KMP, which provides a new perspective for the development of therapeutic approaches for IPF.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Antioxidants represented by kaempferol have been shown to be effective against atherosclerosis (AS). However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to reveal the mechanism of kaempferol regarding the treatment of AS and accumulation of foam cell. METHODS: We explored the contribution of kaempferol to the levels of inflammatory factors, scavenger receptor CD36, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS, MAPK/NF-κB, Nrf2/HO-1, Ca2+ and Piezo1 levels in RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to ox-LDL. In addition, to explore whether kaempferol inhibits ox-LDL-induced foamy macrophage through Piezo1, we extracted macrophages from Piezo1 macrophage-specific knockout (Piezo1ΔLysM) mice. For further validation, ApoE-/- and Piezo1 macrophage-specific knockout mice (Piezo1ΔLysM/ ApoE-/-) were generated. RESULTS: The results showed that kaempferol notably suppressed inflammatory response, CD36 expression, mitochondrial membrane potential elevation, ROS production, MAPK/NF-κB expression, Ca2+ influx, and increased Nrf2/HO-1 levels in RAW264.7. In addition, depletion of macrophage Piezo1 also effectively reduced lipid droplet deposition, inflammatory factor expression, oxidative damage, MAPK/NF-κB, Ca2+ influx, and increased Nrf2/HO-1 expression in mouse BMDMs, and the results were still consistent after kaempferol treatment. In vivo studies have shown that kaempferol significantly reduces atherosclerotic plaque formation. However, the beneficial effect of kaempferol was attenuated in Piezo1 depletion mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results collectively provide compelling evidence that kaempferol regulates CD36-mediated mitochondrial ROS production by inhibiting the Piezo1 channels and Ca2+ influx, and then regulates the downstream pathways of NF-κB/MAPK and HO-1/Nrf2, inhibiting to the formation of foam cells. In conclusion, this study revealed a potential mechanism by which the natural antioxidant kaempferol prevents foamy macrophage."

Prognosis is poor and influenced by multiple factors, making early detection and comprehensive treatment crucial for patient survival. Kaempferol, a flavonoid compound, has attracted attention due to its anti-tumor biological activity, holding promise as a potential drug for treating digestive system neoplasms. Derived from various plants such as cabbage, propolis, and grapefruit, this compound's anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and other pharmacological effects have been confirmed. Research has found that kaempferol inhibits the occurrence and development of digestive system neoplasms by inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, suppressing tumor metastasis and invasion, and enhancing the effects of other cancer treatment methods. This paper summarizes the role and mechanisms of kaempferol in the study of digestive system neoplasms, providing valuable insights for both scientists and clinical physicians engaged in this field. By detailing the various pathways through which kaempferol exerts its anticancer effects, the paper not only highlights its potential as a therapeutic agent but also opens avenues for further research into its applications."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Kaempferol (KAE) is a flavonoid found in various plants. Recent studies showed that high dietary intake of KAE was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction; however, the cardioprotective mechanism of KAE remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of KAE on cardiac injury in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced rats and cobalt chloride (CoCl2)-treated cardiomyocytes, and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Male rats were pretreated with different doses of KAE for 14 days, and then injected with ISO to induce myocardial ischemia injury. We also established a model of myocardial cell injury using rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes stimulated with CoCl2. RESULTS: We found that KAE pretreatment significantly alleviated myocardial injury and improved cardiac function in ISO-injected rats. In addition, KAE reduced oxidative stress in rats with myocardial ischemia by decreasing malondialdehyde concentration and increasing superoxide dismutase activity, and protection of the myocardial mitochondrial structure. KAE also attenuated CoCl2-induced injuryof H9c2 cardiomyocytes via suppression ofoxidative stress. With regard to the mechanism, we found that KAE down-regulated HDAC3 expression and up-regulated Nrf2 expression in ISO-induced rats and CoCl2-stimulated cardiomyocytes. Incubation of cardiomyocytes with HDAC3-selective inhibitor RGFP966 augmented the protective effect of KAE and reduced oxidative stress. By contrast, HDAC3 overexpression by adenovirus attenuated the effect of KAE on oxidative stress compared with KAE treatment group. HDAC3 also regulated Nrf2 expression in the cardiomyocytes with RGFP966 or an adenovirus overexpressing HDAC3; but Nrf2 inhibition reduced the effect of KAE on ROS generation in CoCl2-induced cardiomyocytes. Immunoprecipitation assay showed that HDAC3 interacted with Nrf2 in cardiomyocytes. Further studies found that KAE increased the acetylation level of Nrf2, while HDAC3 overexpression decreased the acetylation of Nrf2 compared with KAE treatment group. CONCLUSION: Our data show that KAE ameliorates cardiac injury by reducing oxidative stress via the HDAC3-mediated Nrf2 signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes."

METHODS: Target molecules for EUO, osteoarthritis, and osteogenic differentiation were identified through network pharmacology analysis. BMSCs were isolated and treated with various concentrations of kaempferol. Optimal concentration was determined through MTT assays. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin Red S staining, while osteogenic markers (Collagen I, RUNX2, and OPN) and CAV-1 expression were analyzed using RT-qPCR and Western blot. The effects of combined treatment with kaempferol and an overexpression vector for CAV-1 (oe-CAV-1) on osteogenic differentiation were also observed. RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis identified kaempferol as the primary active component influencing CAV-1 targeted in subsequent experiments. It was found that 10 µM kaempferol was optimal for treating BMSCs. Post-treatment, significant increases in ALP activity and calcium deposition were observed, along with elevated expression of osteogenic markers, and decreased CAV-1. Overexpression of CAV-1 significantly reversed the promotive effects of kaempferol on BMSC osteogenic differentiation, effectively inhibiting the process. CONCLUSION: Collectively, kaempferol promotes osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs by inhibiting CAV-1 expression.",

      "abstract": "Despite the increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of glioblastoma (GBM), treatment options for this tumor remain limited. Recently, the therapeutic potential of natural compounds has attracted great interest. Thus, dietary flavonoids quercetin (QCT) and kaempferol (KMF) were investigated as potential cytostatic agents in GBM. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of QCT and KMF, determining their bioavailability and therapeutic efficiency, were evaluated. We proved that both polyphenols significantly reduced the viability of GBM cells. We also demonstrated that both QCT and KMF evoked the cytotoxic effect in T98G cells via induction of apoptotic cell death as shown by increased activity of caspase 3/7 and caspase 9 together with an overexpression of the cleaved form of PARP. Apoptosis was additionally accompanied by the activation of stress responses in QCT- and KMF-treated cells. Both polyphenols caused oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as demonstrated by the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), deregulated expressions of superoxide dismutases (SOD2 and Sod1 on protein and transcriptomic levels, respectively), as well as an overexpression of ERO1α, GRP78, p-JNK, and an up-regulation of Chop, Atf4 and Atf6α genes. The antitumor effect of QCT and KMF was also confirmed in vivo, showing reduced growth of tumor xenografts in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) experiment. Moreover, electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) was used to measure the zeta potential of cell membranes upon exposition to QCT and KMF. Additionally, on the basis of existing physicochemical data, the drug-likeness score of QCT and KMF was evaluated. Analyses showed that both compounds accomplish Lipinski's Rule of 5, and they both fit into the criteria of good central nervous system (CNS) drugs. Altogether, our data support the idea that QCT and KMF might be plausible candidates for evaluation as therapeutic agents in preclinical models of glioblastoma.",

      "abstract": "Several studies with kaempferol (KP) and linearolactone (LL) have demonstrated their antiparasitic activity. However, the toxicity of these treatments is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the possible toxicological effects of intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of KP or LL on the amoebic liver abscess model (ALA) in Mesocricetus auratus. An ALA was induced in male hamsters with 1.5 × 105Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) trophozoites inoculated in the left hepatic lobe. The lesion evolved for 4 days, and then KP (5 mg/kg body weight/day) or LL (10 mg/kg body weight/day) was administered for 4 consecutive days. Then, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), paraclinical analyses, and necropsy for histopathological evaluation were performed. There was similar ALA inhibition by KP (19.42%), LL (28.16%), and metronidazole, the antiamoebic control (20.87%) (p ≤ 0.05, analysis of variance [ANOVA]). There were hepatic and renal biochemical alterations in all treatment groups, mainly for KP (aspartate aminotransferase: 347.5 ± 37.5 U/L; blood urea nitrogen: 19.4 ± 1.9 g/dL; p ≤ 0.05, ANOVA). Lesions found in the organs were directly linked to the pathology. In conclusion, KP and LL decreased ALA development and exerted fewer toxicological effects compared with metronidazole. Therefore, both compounds exhibit therapeutic potential as an alternative treatment of amoebiasis caused by E. histolytica. However, additional clinical studies in different contexts are required to reaffirm this assertion.",

      "abstract": "Colon cancer remains a significant global health concern, necessitating the continuous exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. Cisplatin is a first-line chemotherapy medication that is frequently used to treat patients for a variety of malignancies, including colon cancer. However, a major obstacle to its clinical usefulness is acquired resistance. This research investigates the synergistic effects of kaempferol, a natural flavonoid with known anti-cancer properties, in combination with cisplatin, in colon cancer cells. Our study employed colon cancer cell lines to evaluate the individual and combined cytotoxic effects of kaempferol and cisplatin. The results demonstrated a notable enhancement in the cytotoxicity of colon cancer cells when treated with a combination of kaempferol and cisplatin compared to individual treatments. This synergistic effect was further characterized by an increase in apoptosis, as evidenced by morphological changes and biochemical markers of apoptosis and cell cycle. The investigations revealed that the combined treatment led to the modulation of key apoptotic pathways, including the upregulation of pro-apoptotic factors and downregulation of anti-apoptotic factors. Additionally, the synergistic effect was associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell cycle arrest. The findings of this study suggest that the combination of kaempferol and cisplatin holds promise as a potent therapeutic strategy for colon cancer treatment, potentially enhancing the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy while minimizing adverse effects. Further in-depth investigations, including in vivo studies, are warranted to validate these findings and explore the translational potential of this synergistic approach in clinical settings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kaempferol (Kae) is a natural flavonol compound with excellent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, which is of great importance in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The efficacy of Kae in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been demonstrated. However, its relevant pharmacodynamic mechanism requires further investigation. PURPOSES: This study aimed to further explore the potential mechanism of action of Kae in the treatment of RA using network pharmacology, single-cell analysis, and animal experiments. METHODS: Drug target genes were downloaded and screened from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), SwissTargetPrediction database, BindingDB database, and TargetNet database. Transcriptome data from GEO databases (GSE55235, GSE89408, and GSE200815) were selected for disease transcriptome analysis and single-cell matrix data. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to investigate the potential mechanism of action of Kae in treating RA. Single-cell analysis, immune infiltration co-expression analyses, and Mendelian-Randomization (MR) studies were conducted to explore the relationship between Kae's target genes and immune cells. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in DBA/1 mouse models through enhanced immunization. Therapeutic efficacy of Kae was assessed using arthritis score, paw swelling index, body weight monitoring, microCT, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Safranin O-Fast green staining, and Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Tissue immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to detect expression levels of key genes and immune cell activation status. RESULTS: In vivo experiments demonstrated the efficacy of Kae in treating CIA mice. Network pharmacology indicated that Kae might exert anti-inflammatory effects through the NLRP3/CASP1/GSDMD axis. Immune infiltration, single-cell, and MR analyses revealed close associations between Kae's target genes and CD4+, CD8+, and regulatory T cells. Kae inhibited cellular pyroptosis in joint tissues and down-regulated NLRP3, CASP1, and GSDMD expression. Flow cytometry results showed decreased CD4/CD8 ratio, reduced proportion of CD4+ effector memory T cells (Tem), and increased naïve and regulatory T cells (Treg). CONCLUSION: Kae might exert anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the NLRP3/CASP1/GSDMD axis to inhibit pyroptosis and suppress overactive immune responses by regulating T-cell proliferation. In summary, Kae demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in treating RA.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the novel therapeutic potential of quercetin and kaempferol, two bioactive compounds derived from Carthamus tinctorius L., in treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by modulating the bile acid receptor NR1H4 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group H Member 4) and its associated metabolic pathways. A rat model of NAFLD was established, and RNA sequencing and proteomics were carefully employed to identify differential gene expressions associated with the disease. The active components of Carthamus tinctorius L. were screened, followed by the construction of a comprehensive network that maps the interactions between these components, NR1H4 and NAFLD-related pathways. Both in vitro (using HepG2 cells) and in vivo experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects on NR1H4 expression levels through Western blot and RT-qPCR analyses. Our findings identify NR1H4 as a pivotal target in NAFLD. Network pharmacology analysis indicates that quercetin and kaempferol play crucial roles in combating NAFLD, with in vitro and in vivo experiments confirming their ability to mitigate hepatocyte steatosis by enhancing NR1H4 expression. Notably, the protective effects of these compounds were inhibited by the NR1H4 antagonist guggulsterone, highlighting the importance of NR1H4 upregulation. This study demonstrates the novel therapeutic efficacy of quercetin and kaempferol from Carthamus tinctorius L. in treating NAFLD through NR1H4 upregulation. This mechanism contributes to the regulation of lipid metabolism, improvement of liver function, reduction of inflammation, and alleviation of oxidative stress, offering a promising direction for future NAFLD treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Kidney is an essential organ that is highly susceptible to cellular injury caused by various toxic substances in the blood. Several studies have shown that untreated injuries to this organ can cause glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and tubular cell apoptosis, leading to kidney failure. Despite significant advancements in modern treatment, there is no fully effective drug for repairing its function, providing complete protection, and assisting in cell regeneration. Furthermore, some available medications have been reported to exacerbate injuries, showing the need to explore alternative treatments. Natural drugs are currently being explored as a new therapeutic strategy for managing kidney diseases. Kaempferol, a polyphenol found in plants, including vegetables, legumes, and fruits, has been extensively studied in various nephrotoxicity protocols. The compound has been reported to have potential as a nephroprotective agent with beneficial effects on various physiological pathways, such as CPL-induced kidney injury, DOX, LPO, ROS, RCC, and diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, this study aims to provide a brief overview of the current nephroprotective effects of kaempferol, as well as its molecular mechanisms of action, biosynthesis pathways, and clinical prospects."

This study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanisms by which kaempferol stimulates Cl- secretion in the T84 human colon carcinoma cell line by Ussing chambers and voltage clamp technique. Bilateral addition of kaempferol (1-100 µM) increased short-circuit current (I sc ) in a concentration-dependent manner. Ion substitution of Cl- or CFTR inhibitors NPPB and glibenclamide or a Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter inhibitor bumetanide attenuated kaempferol-induced I sc response. In permeabilized monolayers, selective channel inhibitors CFTRinh-172 and CaCCinh-A01 inhibited kaempferol-induced apical Cl- current (I Cl ), and K+ blockers BaCl2 and clotrimazole inhibited basolateral K+ current (I Kb ). The kaempferol-induced I Cl showed no additive effects with forskolin or 8cpt-cAMP. The kaempferol-induced I Cl was mostly abolished by protein kinase A inhibitor H89, but not by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, AG490 and tyrphostin A23, or tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate. Treatment with kaempferol for 24 h increased the expression of CFTR protein as determined by the Western blot analysis. These results demonstrated that kaempferol activates Cl- secretion across T84 cells by activating the apical Cl- current and basolateral K+ current. The mechanisms may involve the cAMP/PKA pathway and CFTR expression. Taken together, these findings reveal the beneficial effects of kaempferol to increase fluid secretion which can be used to treat constipation."

      "abstract": "Cancer remains a global health problem that requires constant research for the development of new treatment strategies. Flavonoids, a diverse group of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds abundant in fruits, vegetables, and other plant sources, have received considerable attention for their potential anticancer properties. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current scientific literature on five specific natural flavonoids, namely quercetin, Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG), kaempferol, apigenin, and curcumin that have been widely reported in numerous carcinomas and evaluate their effectiveness and mechanisms in fighting different types of cancer. Known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, quercetin has shown promise in inhibiting cancer cells and modulating key signaling pathways. EGCG, a prominent catechin found in green tea, has been extensively studied for its ability to induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis, highlighting its potential as an anticancer agent. Kaempferol has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and has shown anticancer potential by modulating cellular processes involved in tumor development. Apigenin, abundant in parsley and chamomile, has been shown to exert anticancer properties by interrupting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Curcumin has shown several anticancer effects, including inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and modulating inflammatory pathways. Despite these promising findings, it is essential to recognize the complexity of cancer biology and the need for further research to clarify the precise mechanisms of action of these natural flavonoids and optimize their therapeutic applications. Furthermore, understanding flavonoids' potential synergy and interactions with traditional cancer therapies is paramount for developing effective combinatorial strategies. This review thus aimed to summarize the current knowledge on these natural flavonoids and provide insight into their potential role as an adjunctive or stand-alone therapy in the fight against breast, prostate, colon, lung, skin, ovarian, liver, and pancreatic cancer."

Dietary intervention with kaempferol could reduce the lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as attenuated serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in HFD-fed mice (p < 0.001 for IL-6 and p < 0.01 for TNF-α at kaempferol 60 mg/kg/d). Meanwhile, histopathological examination revealed that there was no substantial damage or distinct inflammation lesions in organs at the experimental dose, including the heart, lung, kidney, and spleen.

      "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) has been recognized as one of the crucial factors in cell cycle regulation and has been proposed as a potential target for cancer therapies, particularly for colorectal cancer (CRC). Due to the increased incidence rate of CRC and challenges associated with existing treatment options, there is a need for efficient and selective anti-cancer compounds. The current work aims to explore the ability of novel kaempferol derivatives as CDK2 inhibitors by performing conceptual pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic analysis. Kaempferol and its derivatives were obtained from PubChem, and the optimized 3D structures of the compounds were generated using Maestro Ligprep. Subsequently, a pharmacophore model was developed to identify compounds with high fitness values, resulting in the selection of several kaempferol derivatives for further study. We evaluated the ADMET properties of these compounds to assess their therapeutic potential. Molecular docking was conducted using Maestro and BIOVIA Discovery Studio version 4.0 to predict the binding affinities of the compounds to CDK2. The top candidates were subjected to MM-GBSA analysis to predict their binding free energies. Molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS were performed to assess the thermodynamic stability of the ligand-protein complexes. The results revealed several kaempferol derivatives with high predicted binding affinities to CDK2 and favorable ADMET properties. Specifically, compounds 5281642, 5318980, and 14427423 demonstrated binding free energies of -30.26, -38.66, and -34.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that these ligand-protein complexes remained stable throughout the simulation period, with RMSD values remaining below 2 Å. In conclusion, the identified kaempferol derivatives show potential as CDK2 inhibitors based on computational predictions and demonstrate stability in molecular dynamics simulations, suggesting their future application in CRC treatment by targeting CDK2. These computational findings encourage further experimental validation and development of kaempferol derivatives as anti-cancer agents."

In the present work, the MeOH extract of aerial parts of B. mattogrosensis was subjected to chromatographic fractionation to afford three flavonoids: apigenin (1), quercetin (2), and kaempferol (3) as well as a mixture three chlorogenic acids: 3,4-O-dicaffeoylquinic (4), 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic (5), and 4,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic (6) acids. When tested in vitro, kaempferol (3) exhibited activity against Schistosoma mansoni with EC50=81.86 μM, whereas compounds 1, 2, 4-6 showed to be inactives. Considering this result, the effects of kaempferol (3) against S. mansoni infection using an experimental approach (in vivo assay) was tested at first time. Using a single oral dose (400 mg/kg) of kaempferol (3) to S. mansoni-infected mice reduced the worm burden by 25.5 %. Similarly, the number of eggs, which are responsible for a variety of pathologies and transmission of schistosomiasis, was decreased by 28.8 % in treated mice. Collectively, although kaempferol (3) is partially active when administered orally in a mouse model of schistosomiasis, our results suggest that this compound could be, in future studies, administered in different forms, such as nanoformulation.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of breast cancer, is an aggressive phenotype that lacks estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and human epidermal growth (HER-2) receptors, which is challenging to treat with standardized hormonal therapy. Kaempferol is a natural flavonoid with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anticancer effects. Besides anti-tumorigenic, antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects, kaempferol protects non-cancerous cells. Kaempferol showed anti-breast cancer effects by inducing DNA damage and increasing caspase 3, caspase 9, and pAMT expression, modifying ROS production by Nrf2 modulation, inducing apoptosis by increasing cleaved PARP and Bax and downregulating Bcl-2 expression, inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase; inhibiting immune evasion by modulating the JAK-STAT3 pathway; and inhibiting the angiogenic and metastatic potential of tumors by downregulating MMP-3 and MMP-9 levels. Kaempferol holds promise for boosting the efficacy of anticancer agents, complementing their effects, or reversing developed chemoresistance. Exploring novel TNBC molecular targets with kaempferol could elucidate its mechanisms and identify strategies to overcome limitations for clinical application. This review summarizes the latest research on kaempferol's potential as an anti-TNBC agent, highlighting promising but underexplored molecular pathways and delivery challenges that warrant further investigation to achieve successful clinical translation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Echis ocellatus envenoming is potentially toxic initiating clinical damages on male reproductive system. Kaempferol is a therapeutic agent with neutralizing potentials on snake venom toxins. This study investigated the antagonistic effect of kaempferol on E. ocellatus venom (EoV)-induced reproductive toxicities. METHODS: Fifty adult male rats were sorted at random into five groups of ten rats for this study. The control rats were allotted to group 1, while rats in groups 2-5 were injected with 0.22 mg/kg bw (LD50) of EoV intraperitoneally. Rats in group 2 were not treated while groups 3-5 rats were treated with serum antivenom (0.2 ml), and 4 and 8 mg/kg bw of kaempferol post envenoming, respectively. RESULTS: EoV actuated reproductive toxicity, significantly decreased sperm parameters, and enhanced inflammatory, oxidative stress, and apoptotic biomarkers in reproductive organs of untreated envenomed rats. However, treatment with kaempferol alleviated the venom-induced reproductive disorders with a dose dependent effect. Kaempferol significantly increased the testicular weight, organo-somatic index, sperm parameters, and normalized the levels of serum luteinizing hormone, testosterone, and follicle stimulating hormone. Kaempferol ameliorated testicular and epididymal oxidative stress as evidenced by significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, enhancement of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities. The inflammatory biomarkers; nitric oxide (NO) levels and myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), and apoptotic biomarkers; caspase 3 and caspase 9 activities were substantially suppressed in the testis and epididymis of envenomed rats treated with kaempferol. CONCLUSION: Results revealed kaempferol as a potential remedial agent against reproductive toxicity that could manifest post-viper envenoming.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation and swelling. Several studies have demonstrated that RA fibroblast-like synovial cells (RA-FLS) play an important role in RA pathogenesis. Activated RA-FLS contribute to synovial inflammation by secreting inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. LMT-28 is derivative of oxazolidone and exerts anti-inflammatory effects on RA via IL-6 signaling pathway regulation. LMT-28 also regulates T cell differentiation in RA condition. However, the effect of LMT-28 on the migration and invasion of RA-FLS remains unknown. Kaempferol has been reported to have pharmacological effects on various diseases, such as inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Additionally, kaempferol has been reported to inhibit RA-FLS migration and invasion, but it is not known about the therapeutic mechanism including molecular mechanism such as receptor. The present study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of the combined treatment of LMT-28 and kaempferol on RA-FLS activation and RA pathogenesis in mouse model. LMT-28 and kaempferol co-administration inhibited RA disease severity and histological collapse in the joint tissues of CIA mice, as well as downregulated the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse serum. Additionally, the combined treatment inhibited excessive differentiation of T helper 17 cells and osteoclasts. Furthermore, compared with single treatments, combined treatment showed enhanced inhibitory effects on the hyperactivation of IL-6-induced signaling pathway in RA-FLS. Combined treatment also inhibited RA-FLS cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and suppressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinase in RA-FLS. Furthermore, we confirmed that the combined treatment inhibited chondrocyte proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, our results suggest that the combined treatment of LMT-28 and kaempferol exerts a synergistic effect on the RA development via the regulation of IL-6-induced hyperactivation of RA-FLS. Furthermore, this study suggests that combination therapies can be an effective therapeutic option for arthritis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The accumulation of poorly folded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) promotes ER stress and contributes to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Current therapies have various adverse effects, therefore, laying the need for an alternative approach. Kaempferol (KP), a naturally occurring flavonoid, possesses potent anti-proliferative properties against various cancer cells. Nevertheless, its involvement in HCC remains relatively unexplored, particularly regarding its influence on apoptosis and autophagy pathways. METHODS: The effect of KP on cell viability, and motility of Hep3B cells was evaluated by MTT, and scratch assay, respectively. Hoechst staining and FACS analysis were done to check the effect of KP on apoptosis and cell cycle progression. qRTPCR was used to evaluate the expression of several apoptosis and autophagy-related genes. KP was docked with several ER stress-related proteins involved in HCC to gain further insights into molecular mechanisms. The results of docking studies were validated with MD simulation and in vitro studies. RESULTS: Treatment with KP at different time intervals showed dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition of liver cancer cells. KP decreased motility and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase in Hep3B cells. Additionally, in the context of HCC, the relationship between KP, apoptosis, and autophagy is significant. It induced apoptosis and autophagy in Hep3B cells by downregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and upregulated Bax and Bid, Caspase-3, Beclin-1, and LC3. KP showed a better binding affinity with Nrf2, PERK, and IRE1α among all selected proteins. Further, it reversed the protective effect of 4-PBA (ER Stress inhibitor) by inducing apoptosis and autophagy in Hep3B cells. CONCLUSION: The study suggested KP as a potential chemopreventive agent for managing HCC by effectively inducing apoptosis and autophagy in Hep3B cells."

It has various bioactivities, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and other beneficial properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effects of kaempferol on the proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy of KB cells, a human cervical cancer cell line, and the corresponding action mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibitory efficacy of kaempferol on KB cervical cancer cells was investigated through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, migration assay, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, flow cytometry, acridine orange staining and western blotting. RESULTS: Kaempferol reduced KB cell viability and migration in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, kaempferol-induced apoptosis was confirmed, and kaempferol treatment influenced levels of apoptotic proteins. Autophagy was detected upon visualization of characteristic autophagic vacuoles and acidic vesicular organelles, and verified using western blotting, which revealed elevated levels of autophagy-related proteins. Kaempferol-mediated apoptosis and autophagy were evidently attributable to reduced phosphorylation in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. This finding was validated using a pharmacological inhibition assay with the PI3K pathway inhibitor LY294002, which promoted KB cell apoptosis and autophagy. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that kaempferol induces apoptosis and autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in human cervical cancer cells, empirically showing the anticancer effects of kaempferol, and thereby presenting it as a potential anticancer therapeutic agent.",

Biological studies were conducted to evaluate the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of these complexes on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Treatment with Kam 100 µM (84.86 ± 7.79%; 64.37 ± 8.24%) and Kam-Zn 100 µM (91.87 ± 3.80%; 87.04 ± 13.0%) showed no significant difference in proliferation between 16 h and 32 h, with the gap width remaining stable. Both Kam-Zn 100 μM and 200 μM demonstrated effective antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity, significantly decreasing cell viability and causing cell death and morphology changes. Antioxidant assays revealed that Kam (IC50 = 5.63 ± 0.06) exhibited higher antioxidant potential compared to Kam-Zn (IC50 = 6.80 ± 0.075), suggesting that zinc coordination impacts the flavonoid's radical scavenging activity by the coordination of metal ion to hydroxyl groups. Computational studies revealed significant modifications in the electronic structure and properties of Kam upon forming 1:1 complexes with Zn2+ ions. Spectroscopy analyses confirmed structural changes, highlighting shifts in absorption peaks and alterations in functional group vibrations indicative of metal-ligand interactions. FT-IR and UV-Vis spectra analysis suggested that Zn coordinates with the 3-OH and 4C=O groups of ligand. These findings suggest that the Kam-Zn complex exhibits interesting antiproliferative, cytotoxic and modified antioxidant effects on MCF-7 cells, providing valuable insights into their structural and anticancer properties."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant hepatic condition that has gained worldwide attention. Kaempferol (Kae), renowned for its diverse biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-aging, and cardio-protective properties, has emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Despite its promising therapeutic potential, the precise underlying mechanism of Kae's beneficial effects in NASH remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the mechanism by conducting comprehensive in vivo and in vitro experiments. RESULTS: In this study, a murine model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was established by feeding C57BL/6 female mice a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Kaempferol (Kae) was investigated for its ability to modulate systemic inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism in this model (20 mg/kg per day). Notably, Kae significantly reduced the expression of NLRP3-ASC/TMS1-Caspase 3, a crucial mediator of liver tissue inflammation. Additionally, in a HepG2 cell model induced with palmitic acid/oleic acid (PA/OA) to mimic NASH conditions, Kae demonstrated the capacity to decrease lipid droplet accumulation and downregulate the expression of NLRP3-ASC/TMS1-Caspase 3 (20 µM and the final concentration to 20 nM). These findings suggest that Kae may hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of NASH by targeting inflammatory and metabolic pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that kaempferol holds potential as a promising therapeutic intervention for ameliorating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",

The bitterness and astringency of these taste-active substances have been described with taste threshold concentrations ranging from 3.3 to 531.7 and 0.3 to 66.4 μmol/L, respectively, as determined by human sensory experiments. In this study, the impact of 1 and kaempferol 3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (8) on TAS2R-linked proton secretion by HGT-1 cells was analyzed by quantification of the intracellular proton index. mRNA levels of bitter receptors TAS2R3, 4, 5, 13, 30, 31, 39, 40, 43, 45, 46, 50 and TAS2R8 were increased after treatment with compounds 1 and 8. Using quantitative UHPLC-MS/MSMRM measurements, the concentrations of 1-9 were determined in rapeseed/canola seeds and their corresponding protein isolates. Depending on the sample material, compounds 1, 3, and 5-9 exceeded dose over threshold (DoT) factors above one for both bitterness and astringency in selected protein isolates. In addition, an increase in the key bitter compound 1 during industrial protein production (apart from enrichment) was observed, allowing the identification of the potential precursor of 1 to be kaempferol 3-O-(2‴-O-sinapoyl-β-d-sophoroside)-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (3). These results may contribute to the production of less bitter and astringent rapeseed protein isolates through the optimization of breeding and postharvest downstream processing.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alpinia officinarum Hance (A. officinarum), a perennial herb known for its medicinal properties, has been used to treat various ailments, such as stomach pain, abdominal pain, emesis, and digestive system cancers. A. officinarum is extensively cultivated in the Qiongzhong and Baisha regions of Hainan, and it holds substantial therapeutic value for the local Li people of Hainan. Kaempferol, a flavonoid derived from A. officinarum, has demonstrated anticancer properties in various experimental and biological studies. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms through which it exerts its anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) effects remain to be comprehensively delineated. AIM OF THE STUDY: This investigation aims to elucidate the anti-HCC effects of kaempferol derived from A. officinarum and to delve into its underlying mechanistic pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to identify active compounds in A. officinarum. HCCLM3 and Huh7 cells were used to study the anti-HCC effect of kaempferol from A. officinarum. The cytotoxicity and proliferation of kaempferol and A. officinarum were measured using CCK-8 and EDU staining. Wound-healing assays and three-dimensional tumor spheroid models were further used to evaluate migration and the anti-HCC activity of kaempferol. The cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression of proteins and genes associated with the cell cycle checkpoints. Finally, bioinformatics was used to analyze the relationship between the differential expression of core targets in the ATM/CHEK2/KNL1 pathway and a poor prognosis in clinical HCC samples. RESULTS: UPLC-MS/MS was employed to detect five active compounds in A. officinarum, such as kaempferol. The CCK-8 and EDU assays showed that kaempferol and A. officinarum significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells. A wound-healing assay revealed that kaempferol remarkably inhibited the migration of HCC cells. Kaempferol significantly suppressed the growth of tumor spheroids. In addition, kaempferol markedly induced G2/M arrest and promoted apoptosis of HCC cells. Mechanically, kaempferol significantly reduced the protein and mRNA expression levels of ATM, CHEK2, CDC25C, CDK1, CCNB1, MPS1, KNL1, and Bub1. Additionally, the combination of kaempferol and the ATM inhibitor KU55933 had a more significant anti-HCC effect. The results of bioinformatics showed that ATM, CHEK2, CDC25C, CDK1, and KNL1 were highly expressed in patients with HCC and cancer tissues, indicating that these genes have certain value in the clinical diagnosis of HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results revealed that kaempferol from A. officinarum inhibits the cell cycle by regulating the ATM/CHEK2/KNL1 pathway in HCC cells. In summary, our research presents an innovative supplementary strategy for HCC treatment.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to develop an innovative nanomedicine-based therapeutic strategy to alleviate Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorder (PND) in patients undergoing surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To achieve this goal, polydopamine-coated Kaempferol-loaded Metal-Organic Framework nanoparticles (pDA/KAE@ZIF-8) were synthesized and evaluated. The study involved encapsulating Kaempferol (KAE) within ZIF-8 nanoparticles, followed by coating with polydopamine (PDA) to enhance biocompatibility and targeted delivery. The characterization of these nanoparticles (NPs) was conducted using various techniques including Scanning Electron Microscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction, and Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy. The efficacy of pDA/KAE@ZIF-8 NPs was tested in both in vitro and in vivo models, specifically focusing on their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and protect neuronal cells against oxidative stress. RESULTS: The study found that pDA/KAE@ZIF-8 NPs efficiently penetrated the blood-brain barrier and were significantly taken up by neuronal cells. These nanoparticles demonstrated remarkable Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) scavenging capabilities and stability under physiological conditions. In vitro studies showed that pDA/KAE@ZIF-8 NPs provided protection to HT-22 neuronal cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress, reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and decreased apoptosis rates. In a PND mouse model, the treatment with pDA/KAE@ZIF-8 NPs significantly improved cognitive functions, surpassing the effects of KAE alone. This improvement was substantiated through behavioral tests and a noted reduction in hippocampal inflammation. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study underscore the potential of pDA/KAE@ZIF-8 NPs as an effective nanotherapeutic agent for PND. This approach offers a novel direction in the postoperative care of elderly patients, with the potential to transform the therapeutic landscape for neurocognitive disorders following surgery. The application of nanotechnology in this context opens new avenues for more effective and targeted treatments, thereby improving the quality of life for patients suffering from PND.",

      "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) involves articular cartilage degradation driven mainly by inflammation. Kaempferol (KM), known for its anti-inflammatory property, holds potential for OA treatment. This study investigated the potential of hyaluronic acid (HA)-coated gelatin nanoparticles loaded with KM (HA-KM GNP) for treating knee OA. KM was encapsulated into gelatin nanoparticles (KM GNP) and then coated with HA to form HA-KM GNPs. Physical properties were characterized, and biocompatibility and cellular uptake were assessed in rat chondrocytes. Anti-inflammatory and chondrogenic properties were evaluated using IL-1β-stimulated rat chondrocytes, compared with HA-coated nanoparticles without KM (HA GNP) and KM alone. Preclinical efficacy was tested in an anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT)-induced knee OA rat model treated with intra-articular injection of HA-KM GNP. Results show spherical HA-KM GNPs (88.62 ± 3.90 nm) with positive surface charge. Encapsulation efficiency was 98.34 % with a sustained release rate of 18 % over 48 h. Non-toxic KM concentration was 2.5 μg/mL. In IL-1β-stimulated OA rat chondrocytes, HA-KM GNP significantly down-regulated RNA expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, COX-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13, while up-regulating SOX9 compared to HA GNP, and KM. In vivo imaging demonstrated significantly higher fluorescence intensity within rat knee joints for 3 hours post HA-KM GNP injection compared with KM GNP (185.2% ± 34.1% vs. 45.0% ± 16.7%). HA-KM GNP demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing subchondral sclerosis, attenuating inflammation, inhibiting matrix degradation, restoring cartilage thickness, and reducing the severity of OA in the ACLT rat model. In conclusion, HA-KM GNP holds promise for knee OA therapy.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of metabolic diseases has progressively increased, which has a negative impact on human health and life safety globally. Due to the good efficacy and limited side effects, there is growing interest in developing effective drugs to treat metabolic diseases from natural compounds. Kaempferol (KMP), an important flavonoid, exists in many vegetables, fruits, and traditional medicinal plants. Recently, KMP has received widespread attention worldwide due to its good potential in the treatment of metabolic diseases. To promote the basic research and clinical application of KMP, this review provides a timely and comprehensive summary of the pharmacological advances of KMP in the treatment of four metabolic diseases and its potential molecular mechanisms of action, including diabetes mellitus, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and atherosclerosis. According to the research, KMP shows remarkable therapeutic effects on metabolic diseases by regulating multiple signaling transduction pathways such as NF-κB, Nrf2, AMPK, PI3K/AKT, TLR4, and ER stress. In addition, the most recent literature on KMP's natural source, pharmacokinetics studies, as well as toxicity and safety are also discussed in this review, thus providing a foundation and evidence for further studies to develop novel and effective drugs from natural compounds. Collectively, our manuscript strongly suggested that KMP could be a promising candidate for the treatment of metabolic diseases.",

      "abstract": "The current study explored the protective potential of kaempferol 3-sophoroside-7-glucoside (KSG) against acute lung injury (ALI). Pre-treatment with KSG effectively secured mice from ALI and showed similar efficaciousness to dexamethasone. KSG markedly increased the survival rate and alleviated lung pathological lesions induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, KSG attenuated differential and total cell counts in BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and MPO (myeloperoxidase) activity. KSG counteracted the NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) activation and significantly ameliorated the downstream inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α). Simultaneously, KSG suppressed the over-expression of NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor protein 3), caspase-1, and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin IL-1β (interleukine-1β) and prohibited the elevation of the pyroptotic parameter GSDMD-N (N-terminal domain of gasdermin D) induced by LPS challenge. In addition, KSG significantly enhanced Nrf2 (nuclear-factor erythroid-2-related factor) and HO-1 (heme-oxygenase-1) expression. Meanwhile, KSG mitigated lipid peroxidative markers (malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and 4-hydroxynonenal) and boosted endogenous antioxidants (superoxide dismutase/reduced glutathione/catalase) in lung tissue. In silico analyses revealed that KSG disrupts Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interactions by binding to the KEAP1 domain, consequently activating Nrf2. Specifically, molecular docking demonstrated superior binding affinity of KSG to KEAP1 compared to the reference inhibitor, with docking scores of -9.576 and -6.633 Kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, the MM-GBSA binding free energy of KSG (-67.25 Kcal/mol) surpassed that of the reference inhibitor (-56.36 Kcal/mol). Furthermore, MD simulation analysis revealed that the KSG-KEAP1 complex exhibits substantial and stable binding interactions with various amino acids over a duration of 100 ns. These findings showed the protective anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative modulatory efficiencies of KSG that effectively counteracted LPS-induced ALI and encouraged future research and clinical applications of KSG as a protective strategy for ALI."

However, its therapeutic mechanism remains unclear owing to its complex composition and limited research on its chemical profile. Methods: We employed a targeted metabolome approach, combining selective reaction monitoring/multiple response monitoring (SRM/MRM) with high-performance liquid chromatography and MRM mass spectrometry to quantitatively analyze the flavonoid constituents of Vernonia anthelmintica. We also used network pharmacology and molecular docking to identify potential vitiligo-linked compounds and targets of V. anthelmintica seeds. Additionally, we assessed HaCaT cell proliferation by AAPH-induced, alongside changes in SOD activity and MDA content, following treatment with V. anthelmintica components. Finally, flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and ROS levels. Results and Discussion: We identified 36 flavonoid compounds in V. anthelmintica seeds, with 14 compounds exhibiting druggability. AKT1, VEGFA, ESR1, PTGS2, and IL2 have been identified as key therapeutic target genes, with PI3K/AKT signaling being an important pathway. Notably, kaempferol, one of the identified compounds, exhibited high expression in network pharmacology analysis. Kaempferol exhibited a strong binding affinity to important targets. Further, kaempferol enhanced HaCaT cell viability, inhibited apoptosis, reduced MDA levels, suppressed ROS activity, and upregulated SOD activity, increase the expression of cellular antioxidant genes, including HO-1, GCLC, GCLM, Nrf2, NQO1 and Keap1, providing significant protection against oxidative stress damage in vitro. Here, we present the first comprehensive study integrating SRM/MRM approaches and network analysis to identify active flavonoid compounds within V. anthelmintica (L.) Willd. Moreover, we revealed that its active ingredient, kaempferol, offers protection against AAPH-induced damage in keratinocytes, highlighting its potential as a clinical resource."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) stands as a prevalent secondary complication of diabetes, notably Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D), characterized by immune system involvement potentially impacting the retinal immune response mediated by microglia. Early stages of DR witness blood-retinal barrier permeabilization, facilitating peripheral immune cell interaction with the retinal immune system. Kaempferol (Kae), known for its potent anti-inflammatory activity, presents a promising avenue in DR treatment by targeting the immune mechanisms underlying its onset and progression. Our investigation delves into the molecular intricacies of innate immune cell interaction during DR progression and the attenuation of inflammatory processes pivotal to its pathology. METHODS: Employing in vitro studies, we exposed HAPI microglial and J774.A1 macrophage cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli in the presence or absence of Kae. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments utilized BB rats, a T1D animal model. Retinal explants from BB rats were cultured with Kae, while intraperitoneal Kae injections were administered to BB rats for 15 days. Quantitative PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and Spectral Domain - Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) facilitated survival assessment, cellular signaling analysis, and inflammatory marker determination. RESULTS: Results demonstrate Kae significantly mitigates inflammatory processes across in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo DR models, primarily targeting immune cell responses. Kae administration notably inhibits proinflammatory responses during DR progression while promoting an anti-inflammatory milieu, chiefly through microglia-mediated synthesis of Arginase-1 and Hemeoxygenase-1(HO-1). In vivo, Kae administration effectively preserves retinal integrity amid DR progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings elucidate the interplay between retinal and systemic immune cells in DR progression, underscoring a differential treatment response predominantly orchestrated by microglia's anti-inflammatory action. Kae treatment induces a phenotypic and functional shift in immune cells, delaying DR progression, thereby spotlighting microglial cells as a promising therapeutic target in DR management.",

      "abstract": "Fever is a serious condition that can lead to various consequences ranging from prolonged illness to death. Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg (T. hemsleyanum) has been used for centuries to treat fever, but the specific chemicals responsible for its antipyretic effects are not well understood. This study aimed to isolate and identify the chemicals with antipyretic bioactivity in T. hemsleyanum extracts and to provide an explanation for the use of T. hemsleyanum as a Chinese herbal medicine for fever treatment. Our results demonstrate that kaempferol 3-rutinoside (K3OR) could be successfully isolated and purified from the roots of T. hemsleyanum. Furthermore, K3OR exhibited a significant reduction in rectal temperature in a mouse model of fever. Notably, a 4 μM concentration of K3OR showed more effective antipyretic effects than ibuprofen and acetaminophen. To explore the underlying mechanism, we conducted an RNA sequencing analysis, which revealed that PXN may act as a key regulator in the fever process induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In the mouse model of fever, K3OR significantly promoted the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α during the early stage in the LPS-treated group. However, during the middle to late stages, K3OR facilitated the elimination of IL-6 and TNF-α in the LPS-treated group. Overall, our study successfully identified the chemicals responsible for the antipyretic bioactivity in T. hemsleyanum extracts, and it answered the question as to why T. hemsleyanum is used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treating fever. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the therapeutic potential of T. hemsleyanum in managing fever, and they provide a basis for further research and development in this field.",

Owing to the high rate of postoperative recurrence associated with GC, the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be compromised by the occurrence of severe undesirable side effects. In light of these circumstances, KP, a flavonoid abundantly present in diverse herbal and fruit sources, emerges as a promising therapeutic agent with inherent anti-tumor properties. This study endeavors to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of KP in the context of GC while unraveling the intricate underlying mechanisms. Notably, our investigations unveil that KP stimulation effectively promotes the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles within AGS cells by engaging the NF-κB signaling pathway. Consequently, the signal cascade triggers the cleavage of Caspase-1, culminating in the liberation of IL-18. Furthermore, we ascertain that KP facilitate AGS cell pyroptosis by inducing mitochondrial damage. Collectively, our findings showcase KP as a compelling candidate for the treatment of GC-related diseases, heralding new possibilities for future therapeutic interventions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Mast cells (MCs), as the fastest immune responders, play a critical role in the progression of neuroinflammation-related diseases, especially in depression. Quercetin (Que) and kaempferol (Kae), as two major diet-derived flavonoids, inhibit MC activation and exhibit significant antidepressant effect due to their anti-inflammatory capacity. The study aimed to explore the mechanisms of inhibitory effect of Que and Kae on MC activation, and whether Que and Kae suppress hippocampal mast cell activation in LPS-induced depressive mice. SUBJECTS AND TREATMENT: In vitro assays, human mast cells (HMC-1) were pretreated with Que or Kae for 1 h, then stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 2,5-di-t-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBHQ) for 3 h or 12 h. In vivo assays, Que or Kae was administered by oral gavage once daily for 14 days and then lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally injection to induce depressive behaviors. METHODS: The secretion and expression of TNF-α were determined by ELISA and Western blotting. The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcriptional activity was measured in HMC-1 stably expressing NFAT luciferase reporter gene. Nuclear translocation of NFATc2 was detected by nuclear protein extraction and also was fluorescently detected in HMC-1 stably expressing eGFP-NFATc2. We used Ca2+ imaging to evaluate changes of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in HMC-1 stably expressing fluorescent Ca2+ indicator jGCamP7s. Molecular docking was used to assess interaction between the Que or Kae and calcium release-activated calcium modulator (ORAI). The  hippocampal mast cell accumulation and activation  were detected by toluidine blue staining and immunohistochemistry with β-tryptase. RESULTS: In vitro assays of HMC-1 activated by PtBHQ (PMA and tBHQ), Que and Kae significantly decreased expression and secretion of TNF-α. Moreover, NFAT transcriptional activity and nuclear translocation of NFATc2 were remarkably inhibited by Que and Kae. In addition, the Ca2+ influx mediated by SOCE was suppressed by Que, Kae and the YM58483 (ORAI inhibitor), respectively. Importantly, the combination of YM58483 with Que or Kae had no additive effect on the inhibition of SOCE. The molecular docking also showed that Que and Kae both exhibit high binding affinities with ORAI at the same binding site as YM58483. In vivo assays, Que and Kae significantly reversed LPS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice, and inhibited hippocampal mast cell activation  in LPS-induced depressive mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that suppression of SOCE/NFATc2 pathway-mediated by ORAI channels may be the mechanism of inhibitory effect of Que and Kae on MC activation, and also suggested Que and Kae may exert the antidepressant effect through suppressing hippocampal mast cell activation.",

      "abstract": "Browning of white adipose tissue is a novel approach for the management of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders. Kaempferol (KPF) is a common dietary nutrient found abundantly in many fruits and vegetables and has been shown to have the potential to regulate lipid metabolism. However, the detailed mechanism by which it affects the browning of white adipose tissue remains unclear. In the present study, we sought to determine how KPF induces adipocytes to undergo a browning transformation by establishing a primary adipocyte model and an obese mouse model. Our results showed that KPF-treated mice were rescued from diet-induced obesity, glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, associated with increased expression of adaptive thermogenesis-related proteins. KPF-promoted white adipose browning correlated with the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway, as the use of an AMPK inhibitor in preadipocytes partially reversed the observed browning phenotype of KPF-treated cells. Taken together, these data suggest that KPF promotes browning of white adipose tissue through activation of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway. This study demonstrates that KPF is a promising natural product for the treatment of obesity by promoting white fat browning."

      "abstract": "Kaempferol (KA), an natural antioxidant of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is extensively used as the primary treatment for inflammatory digestive diseases with impaired redox homeostasis. Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) was exacerbated by mitochondrial dysfunction and abundant ROS, which highlights the role of antioxidants in targeting mitochondrial function. However, low bioavailability and high dosage of KA leading to unavoidable side effects limits clinical transformation. The mechanisms of KA with poor bioavailability largely unexplored, hindering development of the efficient strategies to maximizing the medicinal effects of KA. Here, we engineered a novel thioketals (TK)-modified based on DSPE-PEG2000 liposomal codelivery system for improving bioavailability and avoiding side effects (denotes as DSPE-TK-PEG2000-KA, DTM@KA NPs). We demonstrated that the liposome exerts profound impacts on damaging intracellular redox homeostasis by reducing GSH depletion and activating Nrf2, which synergizes with KA to reinforce the inhibition of inadequate fission, excessive mitochondrial fusion and impaired mitophagy resulting in inflammation and apoptosis; and then, the restored mitochondrial homeostasis strengthens ATP supply for PAC renovation and homeostasis. Interestingly, TK bond was proved as the main functional structure to improve the above efficacy of KA compared with the absence of TK bond. Most importantly, DTM@KA NPs obviously suppresses PAC death with negligible side effects in vitro and vivo. Mechanismly, DTM@KA NPs facilitated STAT6-regulated mitochondrial precursor proteins transport via interacting with TOM20 to further promote Drp1-dependent fission and Pink1/Parkin-regulated mitophagy with enhanced lysosomal degradation for removing damaged mitochondria in PAC and then reduce inflammation and apoptosis. Generally, DTM@KA NPs synergistically improved mitochondrial homeostasis, redox homeostasis, energy metabolism and inflammation response via regulating TOM20-STAT6-Drp1 signaling and promoting mitophagy in SAP. Consequently, such a TCM's active ingredients-based nanomedicine strategy is be expected to be an innovative approach for SAP therapy.",

In preliminary studies, KPR can modulate several signaling pathways involved in inflammation, making it a candidate for treating cholecystitis. This study aimed to explore the effects and mechanisms of KPR on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human gallbladder epithelial cells (HGBECs). To assess the impact of KPR on HGBECs, the HGBECs were divided into control, KPR, LPS, LPS + KPR, and LPS + UDCA groups. Cell viability and cytotoxicity were evaluated by MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, respectively, and concentrations of KPR (10-200 μM) were tested. LPS-induced inflammatory responses in HGBECs were to create an in vitro model of cholecystitis. The key inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) levels were quantified using ELISA, The modulation of the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway was measured by western blot using specific antibodies against pathway components (p-IκBα, IκBα, p-p65, p65, p-JNK, JNK, p-ERK, ERK, p-p38, and p38). The cell viability and LDH levels in HGBECs were not significantly affected by 50 μM KPR, thus it was selected as the optimal KPR intervention concentration. KPR increased the viability of LPS-induced HGBECs. Additionally, KPR inhibited the inflammatory factors level (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and protein expression (iNOS and COX-2) in LPS-induced HGBECs. Furthermore, KPR reversed LPS-induced elevation of p-IκBα/IκBα, p-p65/p65, p-JNK/JNK, p-ERK/ERK, and p-p38/p38 ratios. KPR attenuates the LPS-induced inflammatory response in HGBECs, possibly by inhibiting MAPK/NF-κB signaling.",

Our study aims to investigate the potential of kaempferol in preventing and treating OP through a combination of network pharmacology and molecular experiments. Kaempferol and OP-related targets were retrieved from the public database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of common targets was constructed using the STRING database and visualized with Cytoscape 3.9.1 software. Enrichment analyses for GO and KEGG of potential therapeutic targets were conducted using the Hiplot platform. Molecular docking was performed using Molecular operating environment (MOE) software, and cell experiments were conducted to validate the mechanism of kaempferol in treating OP. Network pharmacology analysis identified 54 overlapping targets between kaempferol and OP, with 10 core targets identified. The primarily enriched pathways included atherosclerosis-related signaling pathways, the AGE/RAGE signaling pathway, and the TNF signaling pathway. Molecular docking results indicated stable binding of kaempferol and two target proteins, AKT1 and MMP9. In vitro cell experiments demonstrated significant upregulation of AKT1 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells (p < 0.001) with kaempferol treatment, along with downregulation of MMP9 expression (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. This study predicted the core targets and pathways of kaempferol in OP treatment using network pharmacology, and validated these findings through in vitro experiments, suggesting a promising avenue for future clinical treatment of OP.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of kaempferol on alcoholic steatohepatitis. METHODS: C57BL/6 N mice were utilized to establish Binge-on-Chronic alcohol exposure mice model. Kaempferol was given as the interventional drug to chronic alcohol-fed mice for 6 weeks to assess its effects. In vitro, intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells were stimulated by alcohol, and miRNA-155 mimics were used to further study the effect of kaempferol to miRNA-155 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. HE staining and oil red O staining were used to observe the liver and intestinal tissue damage in each group of mice, and ALT, AST, IL-1β, and TNF-α were detected by kits; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expression was detected by ELISA kit, and the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α was assessed by qRT-PCR; Western blot was utilized to assess the excessive inflammatory response of liver and colon tissue and the related signaling pathway activation. RESULTS: Kaempferol treatment significantly improved pathological changes such as steatosis and vacuolated lesions in liver tissue of the alcohol diet model group, and reduced serum ALT and AST enzyme activities and liver tissue interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA expression levels. Kaempferol significantly reduced the expression of miRNA-155 in the intestinal tissue of alcohol-fed mice, significantly increased their cytokine suppressor signaling 1 (SOCS1) protein expression, inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B and significantly increased the production of the intestinal tight junction proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1. More importantly, kaempferol significantly reduced serum LPS levels in alcoholic steatohepatitis mice. In vitro experiments showed that compared with the control group, kaempferol significantly inhibited the expression level of miRNA-155 in Caco-2 cells under ethanol exposure, decreased the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B, led to an increase in the expression of SOCS1 protein, and increased the production level of occludin protein in Caco-2 cells under the effect of alcohol. In contrast, overexpression of miRNA-155 significantly decreased occludin and SOCS1 protein production and increased nuclear factor kappa-B activation levels in Caco-2 cells, and the administration of kaempferol significantly inhibited this effect. CONCLUSION: Kaempferol improved the stability of gut barrier function to ameliorate hepatic injury induced by alcohol intake through enhancing occludin protein expression, by targeting miR-155 to inhibit the excessive inflammatory response in the intestine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrence and metastasis are the main causes of disease deterioration in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, yet efficient therapeutic strategies are lacking. Natural compounds for efficient antitumour therapeutics are becoming increasingly prominent. Kaempferol, one of the main components of flavonoids in plants, displays a variety of pharmacological activities. Our preliminary experiments suggested that kaempferol could inhibit CRC metastasis and is significantly associated with the β-catenin signalling pathway. Moreover, we also defined the regulatory roles of JMJD2C in β-catenin signalling in our previous work. PURPOSE: This study aims to reveal the mechanism by which kaempferol inhibits CRC progression and regulates the JMJD2C/β-catenin signalling pathway. METHODS: The migratory capabilities of CRC cells after kaempferol intervention were measured by scratch wound healing and transwell assays. Circ_0000345 knockdown CRC stable cell lines were generated by lentivirus infection. The possible mechanism of kaempferol on circ_0000345 was verified by molecular-protein docking and verification program cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). A dual luciferase reporter gene assay was carried out for the targeting relationship among circ_0000345, miR-205-5p and JMJD2C. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to determine the expression of circ_0000345 in tumour tissues. A pulmonary metastatic model of CRC in vitro was built to assess the antimetastatic effect and mechanism of kaempferol in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro, kaempferol inhibits the ability to migrate of CRC cells by reducing the activation of the JMJD2C/β-catenin signalling pathway. MiR-205-5p is a key bridge for kaempferol to inhibit the expression of JMJD2C. The function of miR-205-5p is impeded by circ_0000345, which shows higher expression levels in human metastatic CRC tissues than nonmetastatic CRC tissues, and its formation is regulated by the RNA-binding proteins HNRNPK and HNRNPL. Mechanistically, kaempferol physically interacts with HNRNPK and HNRNPL to suppress JMJD2C by downregulating the expression of circ_0000345. In vivo, kaempferol suppresses CRC lung metastasis. Kaempferol inhibits the activation of JMJD2C/β-catenin signalling through reducing the expression of circ_0000345 in the CRC lung metastasis model. CONCLUSION: Circ_0000345 enhances activation of the JMJD2C/β-catenin signalling pathway through miR-205-5p to promote CRC metastasis. Kaempferol inhibits CRC metastasis through the circ_0000345-mediated JMJD2C/β-catenin signalling pathway, and this effect is influenced as a direct consequence of the binding of kaempferol with HNRNPK and HNRNPL. This provides promising therapeutic and/or adjuvant agents for advanced CRC and sheds light on the multifaceted role of phytomedicine in cancer.",

      "abstract": "Chronic inflammation induced by obesity plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. The infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissues contributes to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Kaempferol, a flavonoid present in various vegetables and fruits, has been shown to possess remarkable anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we used leptin receptor-deficient obese mice (db/db) as an insulin-resistant model and investigated the effects of kaempferol treatment on obesity-induced insulin resistance. Our findings revealed that the administration of kaempferol (50 mg/kg/day, for 6 weeks) significantly reduced body weight, fat mass, and adipocyte size. Moreover, it effectively ameliorated abnormal glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in db/db mice. In the adipose tissue of obese mice treated with kaempferol, we observed a reduction in macrophage infiltration and a downregulation of mRNA expression of M1 marker genes TNF-α and IL-1β, accompanied by an upregulation of Arg1 and IL-10 mRNA expression. Additionally, kaempferol treatment significantly inhibited the STING/NLRP3 signaling pathway in adipose tissue. In vitro experiments, we further discovered that kaempferol treatment suppressed LPS-induced inflammation through the activation of NLRP3/caspase 1 signaling in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Our results suggest that kaempferol may effectively alleviate inflammation and insulin resistance in the adipose tissue of db/db mice by modulating the STING/NLRP3 signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "This study was to investigate the potential mechanisms of treatment with metformin (Met) combined with kaempferol (Kae) against postmenopausal osteoporosis. Experiments were conducted in both ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis rats and in vitro using RAW264.7 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, and HUVECs. Results demonstrated the therapeutic effect of Met combined with Kae on osteoporosis. In vivo, Kae alone and in combination with Met treatments enhanced tibial trabecular microstructure, bone mineral density (BMD), and mechanical properties in OVX rats without causing hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It also reduced bone resorption markers (CTX-1 and TRAP) and increased the bone formation marker (PINP) level in the serum of OVX rats. The expression of bone resorption marker TRAP was reduced, while bone formation markers Runx2 and ALP were enhanced in the bone tissue of OVX rats. Furthermore, Met combined with Kae also promoted the expression of angiogenesis-related markers CD31 and VEGF in OVX rats. In vitro, MC3T3-E1s cells treated with Met combined with Kae showed higher expression of ALP, Runx2, and VEGF. Interestingly, the treatment did not directly promote HUVECs migration and angiogenesis, but enhanced osteoblast-mediated angiogenesis by upregulating VEGF levels. Additionally, Met combined with Kae treatment promoted VEGF secretion in MC3T3-E1, and activated the Notch intracelluar pathway by upregulating HES1 and HEY1 in HUVECs. Meantime, their stimulation on CD31 expression were inhibited by DAPT, a Notch signaling inhibitor. Overall, this study demonstrates the positive effects of Met combined with Kae on osteoporotic rats by promoting osteogenesis-angiogenesis coupling, suggesting their potential application in postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

This research examines the existing literature concerning the involvement of kaempferol in neurological diseases, including stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, neuroblastoma/glioblastoma, spinal cord injury, neuropathic pain, and epilepsy. Numerous in vitro and in vivo investigations have illustrated that kaempferol possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties, contributing to its neuroprotective effects. Kaempferol has been shown to modulate key signaling pathways involved in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, such as the PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and NF-κB pathways. Moreover, kaempferol exhibits potential therapeutic benefits by enhancing neuronal survival, attenuating oxidative stress, enhancing mitochondrial calcium channel activity, reducing neuroinflammation, promoting neurogenesis, and improving cognitive function. The evidence suggests that kaempferol holds promise as a natural compound for the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action, optimize dosage regimens, and evaluate the safety and efficacy of this intervention in human clinical trials, thereby contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge in this field.",

OBJECTIVE: Here, we examined the potential protective benefits of kaempferol (KMF), a flavonol known for its antioxidant properties, on BPA-induced reproductive toxicity in adult male rats. METHODS: Human skin fibroblast cells (HNFF-P18) underwent cell viability assays. Thirty-five male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups: 1) control, 2) BPA (10 mg/kg), 3,4) BPA, and different dosages of KMF (1 and 10 mg/kg). The study examined the rats' testosterone serum level, antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), oxidative markers malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), body weight, weight ratios of testis and prostate, and histopathological examinations. RESULTS: The study revealed that using KMF to treat rats exposed to BPA increased cell viability. Moreover, the rats' testosterone levels, which BPA reduced, showed a significant increase after KMF was included in the treatment regimen. Treatment with BPA led to oxidative stress and tissue damage, but simultaneous treatment with KMF restored the damaged tissue to its normal state. Histopathology studies on testis and prostate tissues showed that KMF had an ameliorative impact on BPA-induced tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS: The research suggests that KMF, a flavonol, could protect male rats from the harmful effects of BPA on reproductive health, highlighting its potential healing properties.",

The venom toxins have been reported to induce male reproductive disorders in envenomed rats. This present study explored the ameliorative potential of kaempferol on NnV-induced male reproductive toxicity. Fifty male wistar rats were sorted randomly into five groups (n = 10) for this study. Group 1 were noted as the control, while rats in groups 2 to 5 were injected with LD50 of NnV (1.0 mg/kg bw; i.p.). Group 2 was left untreated post envenomation while group 3 was treated with 0.2 ml of polyvalent antivenom. Groups 4 and 5 were treated with 4 and 8 mg/kg of kaempferol, respectively. NnV caused substantial reduction in concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone and luteinizing hormone, while sperm motility, volume and counts significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in envenomed untreated rats. The venom enhanced malondialdehyde levels and substantially decreased glutathione levels, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in the testes and epididymis of envenomed untreated rats. Additionally, epididymal and testicular myeloperoxidase activity and nitric oxide levels were elevated which substantiated severe morphological defects noticed in the reproductive organs. However, treatment of envenomed rats with kaempferol normalized the reproductive hormones with significant improvement on sperm functional parameters. Elevated inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers in testis and epididymis were suppressed post kaempferol treatment. Severe histopathological lesions in the epididymal and testicular tissues were ameliorated in the envenomed treated groups.

Objective: To explore the therapeutic effect of kaempferol on lung cancer, as well as its capability to regulate the gut microbiota and stimulate immune function. Materials & methods: Twenty-four BALB/c mice were divided into four groups. The first two groups, consisting of 12 normal mice, were administered either PBS or Kaempferol (Kaem) via gavage. The remaining 12 mice, which were subcutaneously inoculated with Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells, were similarly divided and subjected to the same treatments respectively. The inhibitory effect of kaempferol on xenograft lung cancer models was explored with in vivo experiments, the diversity of gut microbiota was investigated by 16S rDNA sequencing, and the treatment effect on immune cells was quantified using flow cytometry. Results: Kaempferol exerted a significant inhibitory effect on xenograft lung cancer models in vivo. It effectively inhibited the proliferation of LLC cells and significantly activated cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and other immune cells in mice. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples from tumor-bearing mice treated with kaempferol showed a significant increase in the abundances of potentially advantageous microbial species such as c_Bacilli, o_Lactobacillales, f_Lachnospiraceae, s_uncultured_bacterium_g_Lactobacillus, g_Lactobacillus, f_Bacteroidaceae, g_Bacteroides, and s_uncultured_bacterium_g_Bacteroides, s_Bacteroides_acidifaciens. An increase in the proportions of three types of immune cells might associated with the above dominant bacterial species. Conclusion: Kaempferol can inhibit xenograft lung cancer models. Such inhibition effect might come from the activation of T cells, NK cells, and other immune cells which are modulated by the gut microbiota."

According to recent studies, natural products are likely to be effective in cancer prevention and treatment. Among bioactive flavonoids found in fruits and vegetables, kaempferol (KMP) is known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. This systematic review aims to highlight the potential therapeutic effects of KMP on different types of solid malignant tumors. This review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were performed in EMBASE, Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration Library, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar. After the application of study criteria, 64 studies were included. In vitro experiments demonstrated that KMP exerts antitumor effects by controlling tumor cell cycle progression, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion, as well as by inhibiting angiogenesis. KMP was also able to inhibit important markers that regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhanced the sensitivity of cancer cells to traditional drugs used in chemotherapy, including cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. This flavonoid is a promising therapeutic compound and its combination with current anticancer agents, including targeted drugs, may potentially produce more effective and predictable results."

Kaempferol is a flavonoid compound extracted from natural plant products; it exerts numerous pharmacological effects. Kaempferol attenuates sepsis-related ARDS; however, the underlying protective mechanism has not been elucidated completely. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to use network pharmacology and experimental verification to investigate the mechanisms by which kaempferol attenuates sepsis-related ARDS. METHODS: We screened the targets of kaempferol by PharMapper, Swiss Target Prediction, and CTD database. We identified the targets of sepsis-related ARDS by GeneCards, DisGeNet, OMIM, and TTD. The Weishengxin platform was used to map the targets of both kaempferol and sepsis-related ARDS. We created a Venn diagram to identify the intersection targets. We constructed the \"component-intersection targets-disease\" network diagram using Cytoscape 3.9.1 software. The intersection targets were imported into the STRING database for developing the protein-protein interaction network. Metascape was used for the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. We selected the leading 20 KEGG pathways to establish the KEGG relationship network. Finally, we performed experimental verification to confirm our prediction results. RESULTS: Through database screening, we obtained 502, 360, and 78 kaempferol targets, disease targets of sepsis-related ARDS, and intersection targets, respectively. The core targets consisted of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, albumin (ALB), IL-1β, and AKT serine/ threonine kinase (AKT)1. GO enrichment analysis identified 426 items, which were principally involved in response to lipopolysaccharide, regulation of inflammatory response, inflammatory response, positive regulation of cell migration, positive regulation of cell adhesion, positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, response to hormone, regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic process, negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway, and response to decreased oxygen levels. KEGG enrichment analysis identified 151 pathways. After eliminating the disease and generalized pathways, we obtained the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathways. Our experimental verification confirmed that kaempferol blocked the HIF-1, NFκκB, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, diminished TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expressions, suppressed ROS production, and inhibited apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine alveolar macrophage (MH-S) cells. CONCLUSION: Kaempferol can reduce inflammatory response, ROS production, and cell apoptosis by acting on the HIF-1, NF-κB, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, thereby alleviating sepsis- related ARDS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The heavy metals cause repro-toxicity via oxidative stress and suppress the antioxidant enzymes. Kaempferol and vitamin E possess antioxidant properties that can counteract the deleterious heavy metals effects. AIM: The present study was directed to investigate the protective role of kaempferol, alone or with vitamin E, on testicular toxicity mediated by lead acetate in male rats. METHODS: Fifty adult male rats were randomly grouped into five groups (n = 10): the control group received 5 ml distilled water, and the Pb group was intraperitoneally injected with 20 mg/kg of lead acetate. The Pb + Vitamin E group received Pb with 100 mg/kg of vitamin E, the Pb + KAF group received Pb with 50 mg/kg of kaempferol, the Pb + KAF + Vitamin E group received Pb with kaempferol and vitamin E for 6 weeks. RESULTS: The testicular levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, steroidogenic enzyme, serum testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, interleukin (IL)-10, and sperm function were significantly decreased in the Pb group compared with all experimental groups. These parameters were significantly elevated in the Pb + KAF + Vitamin E group compared to other experimental groups. Lead acetate caused elevation in testicular malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, nuclear factor kappa, and sperm abnormality compared to all treatment groups. All these parameters were significantly declined in the Pb + KAF + Vitamin E group and Pb + KAF group compared with the Pb group. The fold changes of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone beta, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, and luteinizing hormone beta, and testicular CYP11A1, LH receptor, and FHr gene expression were significantly upregulated in Pb + KAF + Vitamin E group compared with all experimental groups. In addition, KAF + Vitamin E has the potential to improve testicular regeneration in seminiferous tubules, Leydig, and Sertoli cells. CONCLUSION: Administration of kaempferol alone or with vitamin E can mitigate lead acetate-induced testicular toxicity in rats via its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The current research is the first to demonstrate that kaempferol can exert a preventive role in testicular dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment strategies encompass a triad of medical interventions: surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Among these, the use of chemotherapy, specifically 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), has become a cornerstone in CRC management. However, it is imperative to explore novel approaches that harness the synergistic potential of chemotherapy agents alongside adjunctive compounds to mitigate the severe adverse effects that often accompany treatment. In light of this pressing need, this study focuses on evaluating Kaempferol (KMP) in combination with 5-FU in a DMH-induced CRC animal model, scrutinizing its impact on haematological indices, organ health, and gastrointestinal, hepatotoxic, and nephrotoxic effects. Remarkably, KMP demonstrated haemato-protective attributes and exerted an immunomodulatory influence, effectively counteracting 5-FU-induced damage. Furthermore, organ assessments affirm the safety profile of the combined treatments while suggesting KMP's potential role in preserving the structural integrity of the intestine, and spleen. Histopathological assessments unveiled KMP's capacity to ameliorate liver injury and mitigate CRC-induced renal impairment. These multifaceted findings underscore KMP's candidacy as a promising adjunctive therapeutic option for CRC, underlining the pivotal need for personalized therapeutic strategies that concurrently optimize treatment efficacy and safeguard organ health. KMP holds tremendous promise in elevating the paradigm of CRC management.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential synergy between doxorubicin and two natural rarely in vivo studied anticancer agents; the antioxidant \"Kaempferol\" and prooxidant \"Piperlongumine\" in Ehrlich tumor mice model. 77 albino mice were divided into 11 groups; Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells were injected intramuscularly to develop solid tumors. After 14 days, intratumoral injections of single or combinations of free or Chitosan nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin, Piperlongumine, and Kaempferol were performed. Tumor Characterization of nanoparticles was measured, tumors were histopathologically examined and evaluation of expression for cancer-related genes by real-time PCR. In silico molecular docking was performed to uncover potential novel targets for Piperlongumine and Kaempferol. Despite receiving half of the overall dose compared to the free drugs, the combined doxorubicin/ piperlongumine-chitosan nanoparticles treatment was the most efficient in reducing tumor volume; down-regulating Cyclin D1, and BCL2; as well as the Beclin-1, and Cyclophilin A genes modulating growth, apoptosis, autophagy, and metastasis, respectively; up-regulating the Glutathione peroxidase expression as a defense mechanism protecting from oxidative damage. When combined with doxorubicin, Kaempferol and Piperlongumine were effective against Ehrlich solid tumors. However, the combination with the Piperlongumine-loaded chitosan nanoparticles significantly enhanced its anticancer effect compared to the Kaempferol or the same free compounds.",

      "abstract": "This study sought to determine the anticancer effect of kaempferol, a glycone-type flavonoid glycoside with various pharmacological benefits, on human oral cancer MC-3 cells. In vitro studies comprised a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, annexin V and propidium iodide staining, western blotting analysis, and acridine orange staining, while the in vivo studies entailed a xenograft model, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling. In vitro, kaempferol reduced the rate of survival of MC-3 cells, mediated intrinsic apoptosis, increased the number of acidic vesicular organelles, and altered the expression of autophagy-related proteins. Further, treatment with the autophagy inhibitors revealed that the induced autophagy had a cytoprotective effect on apoptosis in kaempferol-treated MC-3 cells. Kaempferol also decreased the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and increased that of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) and phosphorylated p38 kinase in MC-3 cells, suggesting the occurrence of mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated apoptosis and JNK-mediated autophagy. In vivo, kaempferol reduced tumor growth inducing apoptosis and autophagy. These results showed that kaempferol has the potential use as an adjunctive agent in treating oral cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is an age-related skeletal disease. Kaempferol can regulate bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) osteogenesis to improve OP, but its mechanism related to disulfidptosis, a newly discovered cell death mechanism, remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the biological function and immune mechanism of disulfidptosis- related ribophorin I (RPN1) in OP and to experimentally confirm that RPN1 is the target for the treatment of OP with kaempferol. METHODS: Differential expression analysis was conducted on disulfide-related genes extracted from the GSE56815 and GSE7158 datasets. Four machine learning algorithms identified disease signature genes, with RPN1 identified as a significant risk factor for OP through the nomogram. Validation of RPN1 differential expression in OP patients was performed using the GSE56116 dataset. The impact of RPN1 on immune alterations and biological processes was explored. Predictive ceRNA regulatory networks associated with RPN1 were generated via miRanda, miRDB, and TargetScan databases. Molecular docking estimated the binding model between kaempferol and RPN1. The targeting mechanism of kaempferol on RPN1 was confirmed through pathological HE staining and immunohistochemistry in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. RESULTS: RPN1 was abnormally overexpressed in the OP cohort, associated with TNF signaling, hematopoietic cell lineage, and NF-kappa B pathway. Immune infiltration analysis showed a positive correlation between RPN1 expression and CD8+ T cells and resting NK cells, while a negative correlation with CD4+ naive T cells, macrophage M1, T cell gamma delta, T cell follicular helper cells, activated mast cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, was found. Four miRNAs and 17 lncRNAs associated with RPN1 were identified. Kaempferol exhibited high binding affinity (-7.2 kcal/mol) and good stability towards the RPN1. The experimental results verified that kaempferol could improve bone microstructure destruction and reverse the abnormally high expression of RPN1 in the femur of ovariectomized rats. CONCLUSION: RPN1 may be a new diagnostic biomarker in patients with OP, and may serve as a new target for kaempferol to improve OP.",

Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg has been validated to be highly effective for treating hepatitis. Kaempferol and nicotiflorin are two highly representative flavonoids, which have exhibit therapeutic effects on liver disease. Therefore, the protective mechanism of kaempferol and nicotiflorin on alcohol-induced liver injury were investigated. MAIN METHODS: Forty mice were used in this study. After treatment of Kaempferol and nicotiflorin, serum and liver were collected and used for determination of biochemical indicators, H&E staining, and molecular detection. The interaction of miRNAs from serum extracellular vehicles (EVs) with mRNAs and 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota were also investigated. KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that kaempferol and nicotiflorins significantly ameliorated alcohol-induced liver damage and observably regulated gut microbiota. Specifically, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and CYP2E1 in the liver significantly reduced, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in the liver evidently increased. They also significantly relieved liver oxidative stress and lipid accumulation by suppressing miR-138-5p expression, inversely enhancing deacetylase silencing information regulator 2 related enzyme-1 (SIRT1) levels and then decreasing farnesoid X receptor (FXR) acetylation, which then modulated Nrf2 and SREBP-1c signaling pathways to regulate oxidative stress and lipid metabolism induced by alcohol. SIGNIFICANCE: Kaempferol and nicotiflorin reduced alcohol-induced liver damage by enhancing alcohol metabolism and reducing oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. The intestinal microorganism disorder was also ameliorated after oral kaempferol and nicotiflorin."

Lead (Pb), an environmental pollution, could induce learning and memory deficits. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms underlying Kam actions in Pb-induced learning and memory deficits. In this study, we investigated the effects of Kam on Pb-induced cognitive deficits. Pb-exposed rats were treated with 50 mg/kg Kam from postnatal day (PND) 30 to PND 60. Then, Y-maze and Morris water maze have been used to detect the spatial memory in all groups of rats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Nissl staining were used to analyze the neuronal structure damages. The results found Kam treatment improved the learning and memory ability and alleviated hippocampal neuronal pathological damages. Besides, Kam could significantly reverse the synaptic transmission related protein expression including PSD95 and NMDAR2B. Further research found that Kam downregulated autophagy markers, P62, ATG5, Beclin1, and LC3-II. Furthermore, 3-MA, autophagy inhibitor, increased the levels of NMDAR2B and PSD95 in Pb-induced PC12 cells, indicating Kam alleviated Pb-induced neurotoxicity through inhibiting autophagy activation. Our results showed that Kam could ameliorate Pb-induced cognitive impairments and neuronal damages by decreasing Pb-induced excess autophagy accumulation.",

Kaempferol has been shown to possess notable anti-tumour bioactivity, indicating potential for treating gynaecological malignancies. To date, numerous studies have demonstrated the potential of kaempferol to induce tumour cell apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and prevent metastasis and invasion in several gynaecological malignancies, including breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers. However, there is currently insufficient research investigating the efficacy of kaempferol for the treatment of gynaecological malignancies, and a lack of systematic review of its mechanism of action. Therefore, this review is founded on a literature analysis of the anticancer effects of kaempferol on gynaecological malignancies. The goal is to provide valuable reference material for scientific researchers and medical practitioners."

Due to the lack of licensed prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic drugs, the prevention and control of CCV infection seem to remain stagnant. Active compounds from medicinal plants offer eligible sources of pharmaceuticals and lead drugs to fight against endemic and pandemic diseases and exhibit excellent effect against viral infection. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral ability of 12 natural compounds against CCV with cell models in vitro and found kaempferol exhibited the strongest inhibitory compound against CCV infection among all the tested compounds. Correspondingly, kaempferol decreased transcription levels of viral genes and the synthesis of viral proteins, as well as reduced proliferation and release of viral progeny, the severity of the CPE induced by CCV in a dose-dependent manner, based on quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), western blotting, viral cytopathic effects (CPE) and viral titer assessment. Moreover, time-of-drug-addition assays, virus attachment, and penetration assays revealed that kaempferol exerted anti-CCV activity probably by blocking attachment and internalization of the viral entry process. Altogether, the present results indicated that kaempferol may be a promising candidate antiviral agent against CCV infection, which shed light on the development of a novel and potent treatment for fish herpesvirus infection."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a prevalent malignancy among women globally. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to uncover the mechanism of action of kaempferol in the treatment of cervical cancer using an integrated approach that combines metabolomics with network pharmacology. METHODS: Initially, we investigated the specific metabolites and potential pathways influenced by kaempferol in the pathological progression of cervical cancer, employing UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS metabolomics. In addition, network pharmacology analysis was performed to ascertain the pivotal targets of kaempferol in the context of CC therapy. RESULTS: Metabolomics analysis indicated that the therapeutic effect of kaempferol on cervical cancer is primarily associated with 11 differential metabolites and 7 metabolite pathways. These pathways include arginine and proline metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and tyrosine metabolism. Additionally, kaempferol was found to regulate 3 differential metabolites, namely palmitic acid, citric acid, and L-tyrosine, by directly targeting 7 specific proteins, including AKR1B1, CS, EGFR, PLA2G1B, PPARG, SLCO2B1, and SRC. Furthermore, molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinities between kaempferol and 7 crucial targets. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the intricate mechanisms by which kaempferol acts against cervical cancer. Furthermore, this research offers a novel approach to investigating the potential pharmacological mechanisms of action exhibited by natural compounds.",

However, their poor water solubility, low stability, and limited bioavailability are the primary bottlenecks that restrict their utilization in pharmaceuticals and functional foods. To overcome these drawbacks, this study aims to fabricate astaxanthin/kaempferol co-encapsulated nanoparticles and investigate their synergistic effects on reducing the risk of stress oxidation, chronic inflammation, and lipid accumulation in RAW264.7 and HepG2 cells. The synthesized astaxanthin/kaempferol nanoparticles exhibited well-defined spherical morphology with an average particle diameter ranging from 74 to 120 nm. These nanoparticles demonstrated excellent stability with the remaining astaxanthin content ranging from 82.5% to 92.1% after 6 months of storage at 4 °C. Nanoastaxanthin/kaempferol displayed high dispersibility and stability in aqueous solutions, resulting in a significant enhancement of their bioactivity. In vitro assessments on cell lines revealed that nanoastaxanthin/kaempferol enhanced the inhibition of H2O2-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 and LPS-induced NO production in RAW264.7 compared to nanoastaxanthin. Additionally, these nanoparticles reduced the expression of genes involved in inflammation (iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α). Moreover, hepatocytes treated with nanoastaxanthin/kaempferol showed a reduction in lipid content compared to those treated with nanoastaxanthin, through enhanced regulation of lipid metabolism-related genes. Overall, these findings suggest that the successful fabrication of co-encapsulated nanoparticles containing astaxanthin and kaempferol holds promising therapeutic potential in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."
