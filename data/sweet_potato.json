      "abstract": "The high hydrophilicity of biopolymer-anthocyanin intelligent packaging films seriously limits their applications in high-humidity environments. Here, a surface hydrophobization technique was adopted to overcome the hydrophilicity of purple sweet potato (PSP)-based intelligent packaging films through stearic acid (SA) coating combined with heat pressing treatments. The structural characteristics, physical properties, and color changeability of the films were investigated. After SA coating treatment, the surface of the films was loosely covered by thick SA layers. As compared with the untreated PSP films, the SA-coated films displayed lower transparency, mechanical property, moisture content, surface wettability, anthocyanin leaching potential, and color changeability. When the SA-coated films were further heat-pressed, the SA-coated layers were closely bound to the films. The heat-pressed films had a higher transparency, mechanical property, and water vapor blocking ability than the SA-coated films. Notably, the color and color changeability of the heat-pressed films were affected by the heat pressing temperature. The films heat-pressed at 100 °C showed a vivid purple color and elevated color changeability, whereas the films heat-pressed at 150 °C showed a brown color and lost color changeability. This study demonstrates that SA coating combined with heat pressing is effective in constructing surface-hydrophobized intelligent packaging films."

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the substitution effect of the concentrate mix (CM) with sweet potato vine (SPV) on growth performance, carcass characteristics of rams, and methane (CH4) production. Forty yearling rams with an initial body weight of 18.5 ± 0.7 kg were randomly distributed into five treatment diets with eight rams each. A CM of 385 g/head/d was supplied to the control group (SPV0), and diets were formulated to replace the CM of the control diet with SPV at 10% (SPV10), 20% (SPV20), 30% (SPV30), and 40% (SPV40). After 82 days, four rams from each treatment were randomly selected and slaughtered. The CH4 production was determined from 24-h in vitro gas production (GP), and the digestible organic matter (dOM) and metabolizable energy (ME) were estimated from the GP. Data were analyzed using the one-way ANOVA and orthogonal polynomial contrast functions. Results indicated that the contents of the crude protein (CP) and ash in SPV were 258 and 148 g/kg DM, respectively. The substitution of CM with SPV in the in vivo trial did not affect body weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Rams fed with the SPV0 diet had higher (p < 0.05) hot carcass weight than those reared in the SPV10, SPV20, and SPV40 diets. The slaughter weight and dressing percentage showed significant linear and quadratic effects. Moreover, significant linear and cubic trends were noted for hot carcass, thorax, foreleg, and hindleg. The SPV0 diet had the highest GP (p < 0.001) compared to the SPV30 and SPV40 diets. The SPV40 diet and the pure SPV had the lowest CH4 production (p < 0.001). The SPV0 diet showed similar ME with SPV10 and SPV20 diets but was higher (p < 0.001) than the SPV30 and SPV40 diets and pure SPV. The dOM did not differ between treatment diets. Similarly, the dOM of SPV did not differ (p > 0.05) from that of the SPV30 and SPV40 diets. In conclusion, replacing CM with SPV significantly reduced the in vitro CH4 production without affecting voluntary feed intake, weight gain, some carcass components, and dOM."

      "abstract": "Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), a globally significant staple crop, exhibits remarkable adaptability to various environmental conditions, largely due to its genetic diversity. Recent studies have revealed the presence of naturally integrated Agrobacterium cellular T-DNAs (cT-DNAs) within the sweet potato genome, suggesting their possible role in the evolution and adaptation of sweet potato. In this study, we characterize a newly identified open reading frame (ORF) within the cT-DNA2 region of I. batatas, which encodes a homolog of the A. rhizogenes rolD gene. This ORF encodes a RolD-like protein with ornithine cyclodeaminase (OCD) activity, a key enzyme in proline biosynthesis. Functional assays confirmed that the recombinant RolD-like protein exhibits ornithine-dependent NAD+ reduction, similar to the product of the rolD gene. Notably, rolD-like gene expression was strongly up-regulated by methyl jasmonate treatment, as well as in response to abiotic stresses such as heat, cold, salt, drought, high light, and UV radiation. Overexpression of this rolD-like gene in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in delayed flowering, shortened siliques, and reduced seed production, along with enhanced proline accumulation, indicating its role in stress response mechanisms. These findings suggest that the natural integration of this rolD-like gene may contribute to the sweet potato's resilience to abiotic stresses, offering potential for the development of improved cultivars with enhanced stress tolerance."

      "abstract": "This work introduced repeated freezing-thawing treatment (10, 20, and 30 cycles) to modify sweet potato starch, followed by carboxymethylation. The modified starch's multiscale structure and physicochemical properties were characterized to understand the enhancing effects. Multiple freezing-thawing effectively enhanced carboxymethylation, benefitting from the gradually accumulated depressions, cracks, and pores on the surface of freezing-thawing-treated starch granules. The substitution degree and reaction efficiency of freezing-thawing treated starch ranged from 0.29 to 0.38 and 52.77 % to 63.92 %, respectively, compared to untreated starch (0.23; 43.58 %). A high carboxymethylation induced starch molecule degradation and crystalline structure disruption, as shown by depolymerization of long chains, and a loss of short-range ordered molecular and helical structures. These structural changes facilitated the interaction between carboxymethyl groups, water molecules, and amylose leaching. As a result, water solubility, paste transparency, retrogradation, and viscoelasticity were significantly improved. Freezing-thawing pretreatment provides a promising way to improve carboxymethyl starch's structure, properties, and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "The symbiotic relationship between cover crops and soil microorganisms is closely linked to nutrient cycling and crop growth within agroecosystems. However, how cover crops with different root functional traits influence soil microbial communities, soil properties, and crop yields has remained understudied. This study assessed the root traits of hairy vetch (HV) and rapeseed (RP), along with soil properties, sweet potato yield, and microbial enzyme activity under red soil dryland conditions. High-throughput sequencing was also employed to characterize the diversity, composition, and network structure of soil bacterial and fungal communities. According to the plant economic spectrum theory and our research results on plant root traits, HV can be identified as a resource-acquisitive cover crop, and RP treatment can be identified as a resource-conservative cover crop. Although RP treatment did not significantly increase the sweet potato yield, the increase rate reached 8.49%. Resource-conservative cover crops were associated with increased pH, SOC, and TP, which enhanced bacterial species diversity and boosted the populations of Chloroflexi and Alphaproteobacteria. In contrast, resource-acquisitive cover crops promoted the proliferation of Gammaproteobacteria. Network analysis indicated that resource-conservative cover crops facilitated network complexity through intensified intra-community competition. Resource-acquisitive cover crops enhanced the stability of microbial communities. Collectively, these findings underscore the distinct advantages of cover crops with varying root functional traits in shaping soil microbial communities. Appropriate cover crop rotations can effectively regulate microbial communities and hold the potential to enhance crop yield."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) with high yield and diverse nutrients, is the third most important food crop in the world. Manganese (Mn) is an essential cofactor that plays a critical role in the development and maturation of the crop. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the sweet potato response to Mn remains unclear. RESULTS: In this study, Mn treatment increased the depth of yellow color in sweet potato, augmented sugar and carotenoid accumulation in storage roots, accompanied with a decline in plant hormones. Especially, Mn-treated storage roots displayed more than a 200% increase in β-carotene content compared to the control, while the abscisic acid (ABA) content was reduced by at least 50%. An integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis suggested that Mn application regulated transcriptional and metabolic profiles of carotenoid biosynthesis, soluble sugar, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and biosynthesis of amino acids. Further study revealed that Mn treatment stimulated β-carotene accumulation in storage roots by up-regulation of the transcripts of GGPPS, ZIDS, LCYB and OR, along with down-regulation of CCD1 and CCD4. Moreover, Mn application reduced ABA content through preventing the expression of NCED1. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that Mn, emerging as an agrochemical candidate, will meet agricultural challenges by not only enriching the flesh coloration but also augmenting the nutritional value of sweet potatoes. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

An in vitro starch digestibility assay was employed to measure the contents of rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS), and resistant starch (RS). The intensities of the peaks attributed to covalent vibrational modes at 9.0, 10.5, and 13.1 THz showed a strong correlation with RDS content (R2 > 0.95). Moreover, the intensities of the peaks sensitive to non-covalent forces within and between double helices of starch, around 5.0 and 7.9 THz, were correlated with RS content (R2 > 0.65). These results indicate, after acid hydrolysis and HMT, the starch digestibility of white sweet potato can be determined using THz peaks.",

Conventional medication has limited efficacy in treating TNBC, which highlights the potential of developing therapeutic agents from natural bioactive compounds. This study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity of prodelphinidin (PD), an anthocyanin found in purple sweet potato, in human MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells. The results showed that PD selectively inhibited human breast cancer, particularly TNBC. Furthermore, PD demonstrated significant dose- and time-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cell activity. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis revealed that PD induced cell apoptosis by down-regulating Bcl-2, activating caspase-3/9, and cleaving PARP. Additionally, PD treatment upregulated the expression of p-elF2α, GRP78, and CHOP, indicating the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). PD treatment also increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in TNBC cells. The cytotoxicity of PD reduced significantly by pre-treatment with caspase inhibitors (Ac-DEVD-CHO and Z-LEHD-FMK). In conclusion, PD effectively inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in TNBC cells through the activation of ROS and endoplasmic reticulum stress.",

In this study, we investigated the role of exogenous MT in enhancing heat tolerance in sweet potato, with a particular focus on its capacity to alleviate heat stress-induced damage. MT treatment significantly reduced oxidative stress, as evidenced by decreased levels of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide ions, and malondialdehyde (MDA), all of which were elevated under heat stress. To uncover the underlying mechanisms, RNA sequencing was performed on three experimental groups: control (CK), heat stress alone (HS), and MT pre-treatment followed by heat stress (MH). A total of 3491, 3280, and 1171 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the CK vs. HS, CK vs. MH, and HS vs. MH comparisons, respectively. MT treatment notably modulated the expression of genes involved in redox regulation and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. Moreover, MT enhanced the expression of genes associated with key signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPK3) and plant hormone signal transduction components, such as ethylene response factor (ERF). These findings offer novel insights into the mechanisms by which exogenous MT enhances heat tolerance in sweet potato, highlighting its role in regulating antioxidant systems, metabolic pathways, and hormone signaling. This study presents valuable strategies for improving crop resilience to heat stress."

However, the active ingredients associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment and their underlying mechanisms have not been reported to date. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify novel drugs against AML from sweet potato by integrating metabolomics analysis, network pharmacology, and experimental validation. METHODS: Firstly, ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was employed to analyze the major constituents in sweet potato. Then, nine active ingredients were selected for validation of their anti-leukemia effects. Subsequently, three of them underwent network pharmacology analyses and in vitro experimental verification. Finally, the anti-leukemia effect of cynaroside was further confirmed through in vivo experimental validation. RESULTS: Firstly, the flavonoid content of stem, leaves, flesh, and peel from 13 sweet potato cultivars was examined. The leaves of Nanshu 017 exhibited the highest flavonoid content of 2.27% dry weight (DW). Then, an extract derived from these leaves was employed for in vitro experiments, demonstrating significant inhibition of AML cell growth. Subsequently, based on the results of metabolomics analysis and network pharmacology, cynaroside, nepitrin, and yuanhuanin were identified as potential antileukemia agents present in sweet potato for the first time; while CASP3, KDR, EGFR, and SRC were recognized as pivotal targets of these three monomers against AML. Finally, the antileukemia effects of cynaroside, nepitrin, and yuanhuanin were confirmed through in vitro and in vivo experimental validation. CONCLUSION: In summary, sweet potato leaves extract possesses an antileukemic effect while cynaroside, nepitrin, and yuanhuanin demonstrate potential as treatments for AML."

The condition develops as a potentially fatal illness during the newborn period, but its acute clinical manifestations can be alleviated through a galactose restricted diet. Nonetheless, such dietary intervention is inadequate in preventing significant long-term consequences, including neurological impairments, growth restriction, cognitive delays, and, for most females, primary ovarian insufficiency. At present, no effective therapy exists to stop the progression of these complications, highlighting the urgent need for new treatment approaches to be developed.

Recently, our research team has demonstrated that two generally recognized as safe supplements (purple weet potato color, PSPC and myo-inositol, MI) have been effective in partially restoring functions in the ovaries of our GalT-KO mouse model. However, the toxicological profile of both PSPC and MI has not been determined. In this study, we investigated the acute (30 days) and chronic (180 days) oral toxicities of PSPC and MI both in WT control and GalT-KO mice. Furthermore, our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of oral feeding of PSPC and MI in correcting motor-related and behavioral phenotypes in GalT-KO mice. The long-term treatment of MI at a lower dose demonstrated promising improvements in motor deficit and anxiety driven hyperactivity in the mutant mice.",

      "abstract": "As an important starch crop, sweet potato has significant practical importance for maintaining food security worldwide. This study identified differential expressed genes associated with the expansion of tuberous roots by comparing the transcriptome across tuberous roots at the initial period (initiated tuberous roots (ITRs), rapid expansion period (tuberous roots (TRs), fibrous roots (FRs) at the seedling stage, and fibrous roots at the adult stage (unexpanded FRs (UFRs)). sRNA-seq and degradome analyses were performed to reveal the role of miRNAs in tuberous root development in sweet potato. A total of 29,633 genes and 510 miRNAs were differential expressed among FRs, ITRs, TRs, and UFRs. Integrated analyses of these data revealed genes involved in metabolism, hormone response, and signal transduction that might participate in the induction of tuberous root formation, while genes involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism that might participate in the tuberous root swelling. A joint analysis of miRNAs and DEGs related to tuber development revealed by degradome-seq identified twelve miRNA-target gene pairs involved in gene expression process, hormone response, and metabolism of secondary metabolites that might be key regulators of root tuber development in sweet potato. Moreover, the functions of many miRNA-target gene pairs involved in the initiation of root tuber were related to auxin signaling response, and an exogenous hormone treatment experiment was further performed. The results indicated that auxin treatment had the most significant effect on increasing sweet potato yield, suggesting a dominant role of the auxin pathway in the regulation of sweet potato tuberous root development. Additionally, two miRNA-target pairs, miR319-TCP4 and miR172-AP2, which were identified from the degradome, were verified via 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLR-RACE) and tobacco transient cotransformation tests, and their expression was impacted by auxin treatment, which further validated the reliability of our multiomics analysis results. Our research provides new insights into the role of miRNAs in sweet potato root tuber development.",

It was found that SPS exhibited the characteristics of pseudoplastic fluids, characterized by shear thinning and thixotropy, belonged to the C-type starch crystal. The gelatinization temperature of SPS was increased to 82.55 °C by HMT. HMT-SPS had better viscoelasticity in S3-S6. The particle size was smaller than that of RAW-SPS during the gelatinization process. The starch paste of S2 was gelatinized by heating at 95 °C, and the original crystalline structure of the starch was destroyed, where layered structure formed by recrystallization was observed. HMT-SPS showed a clear polarization cross, while disappeared after S2. HMT also improved the ordering degree. The results explained the mechanism of changes in HMT modified starch during the gelatinization process."

      "abstract": "Sweet potato-oat composite dough is a nutritious, functional dough with promising market potential. This study investigates its quality changes during freeze-thaw cycles from the perspectives of ice crystals and protein alterations to provide theoretical support for its processing and production. After freeze-thaw cycles, both the storage modulus and loss modulus of the dough decrease, resulting in increased hardness, reduced resilience and chewiness, lower sensory scores, decreased specific volume, and darker color. From the perspective of ice crystals, the formation and melting of ice crystals caused significant changes in water status: strongly bound water increased then decreased, weakly bound and free water decreased then increased, and freezable water content rose significantly (p < 0.05). These changes disrupted the dough's structure, leading to pore enlargement and collapse. From the protein perspective, freeze-thaw treatment significantly reduced β-folds and α-helices, causing the protein structure to become loose and disordered, further affecting elasticity and viscosity. Results showed that after more than three freeze-thaw cycles, the dough's processing properties and product quality deteriorated, making it unsuitable for further use. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Sweet potato oatmeal composite dough is a new type of functional composite dough, which is rich in nutrients and has a promising market prospect. This study reveals the mechanism of the influence of ice crystal formation and protein structure changes on the quality of sweet potato oat dough during freezing, which can provide a reference for the study of frozen dough of other miscellaneous grains. By exploring the changes in dough quality during freezing storage and transport, reasonable freezing storage and transport times and conditions were developed to reduce the effects of freezing and thawing on dough quality, and to ensure the taste and value of the product, thus providing consumers with better frozen pasta choices.",

This study aimed to investigate its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-osteoporotic activities, as well as its anthocyanin content. The peel and flesh of MSP were extracted with ethanol and water. Compared with the flesh extracts, the peel extracts presented greater antioxidant capacity and were rich in phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanins, namely, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, peonidin-3-O-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin, and peonidin. The peel extracts suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and enzymes, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, and iNOS, as well as reducing nitric oxide and matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion. The extracts inhibited the RANKL-induced NF-κB and MAPK pathways and downregulated osteoclastogenic marker expression. Under LPS and RANKL treatment, the peel extracts notably reduced reactive oxygen species production while increasing antioxidant gene expression. Furthermore, they increased osteoblast viability and slightly raise alkaline phosphatase activity. These findings suggest that MSP peel could be used as a functional food to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation-related osteoporosis.",

The results showed that the volume ratio, crispness, anthocyanin retention rate and overall acceptability of the samples were maximized after boiling for 6 min at 40 % maltitol concentration achieving increases of 78.63 %, 437.50 %, 392.25 % and 552.94 %, respectively compared to the control (p < 0.05). Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the flour underwent hydrogen bond breaking and formed hydrogen bonds with maltitol at high temperatures, forming maltitol starch-protein / lipid complexes, resulting in decreased crystallinity, short-range ordering, random coil, -helix and enthalpy, while the non-crystalline region area and -sheet increased. Additionally, the viscosity and storage modulus of the flour increased following pregelatinization. Conversely, as maltitol concentration increased, both viscosity and storage modulus decreased, facilitating the expansion of puffing volume due to the instantaneous total drainage of water upon pressure release. Furthermore, SBP effectively preserved the color and anthocyanin content of the chips. These findings may provide valuable insights for regulating oil-free puffing quality of starchy foods.",

METHODS: The objective of this study was to investigate the protective effect of PSP on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice and lung epithelial A549 cells and its mechanism. Moreover, subacute toxicity evaluation of PSP was carried out on ICR mice. RESULTS: The results showed that compared with the ALI group, PSP significantly reduced the total protein content, wet-to-dry (W/D) ratio, the number of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Moreover, PSP was able to reduce cell apoptosis, the levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and increase the level of superoxide (SOD). In addition, PSP could up-regulate the levels of VIP, cAMP, p-PKA/PKA and AQP1 in mice and A549 cells. And PSP exhibited no apparent adverse effects on the mice. CONCLUSIONS: PSP had a protective effect on LPS-induced ALI in mice and lung epithelial A549 cells, which may be related to the inflammatory response and via VIP/cAMP/PKA/AQPs signaling pathway. Thus, PSP may be a promising pharmacologic agent for ALI therapy.",

A total of 288 23-wk-old Hy-line Brown laying hens were randomly divided into 1 of the 4 dietary treatment groups, with 6 replicates and 12 laying hens per replicate. The 4 groups were fed basal diet supplemented with varying concentrations of PSPP (0, 1, 2, or 4 g/kg) for 6 wks. At the end of the feeding trials, eggs were collected for egg quality analysis, jejunal samples were collected for morphology assessment, and cecal content was analyzed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing to determine intestinal microbiota. Experimental treatments did not differ regarding laying performance and egg quality. However, polynomial contrast analysis showed that there was a linear decrease (P = 0.042) in yolk color. The jejunal morphology did not differ among the treatment groups. The alpha and beta diversity were not different between the treatment groups. The cecal microbiota was dominated by Bacteroidota and Firmicutes at the phylum level and Bacteroides at the genus level. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was increased (P = 0.012) and Bacteroidota was decreased (P = 0.009) in the cecal content of PSPP2. Firmicutes to Bacteroidota ratio increased (P = 0.005) in the PSPP2 group. Polynomial contrast analysis showed that PSPP had a quadratic effect on Firmicutes to Bacteroidota ratio (P = 0.004) and on the relative abundance of Firmicutes (P = 0.006) and Bacteroidota (P = 0.006). At the genus level, increasing PSPP level showed a pattern of linear increase (P = 0.046) in [Ruminococcus]_torques_group and linear decrease (P = 0.015) in the Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group. It can be concluded that PSPP altered the gut microbiota, but did not influence jejunal morphology or laying performance and egg quality of laying hens. Further research is recommended to fully understand the potential and determine the optimal level of PSPP in laying hens.",

The results showed that the polysaccharides of all sweet potatoes (untreated and heat-treated) were composed of pyranose structures, had low protein content, and shared the same monosaccharide composition. Infrared spectra showed that the three thermal processing treatments had no significant effect on the functional groups or chemical bonding of sweet potato polysaccharides. In addition, all four polysaccharides exhibited dose-dependent antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities.

The findings indicated that B.pumilus Y-26 and P.lilacinus CS-Z exhibited respective suppression rates of 82.9% and 85.1% against the stem nematode, while also stimulating sweet potato plant growth. Both high-throughput sequencing and Biolog analysis revealed distinct impacts of the treatments on the bacterial communities. At the phylum level, B.pumilus Y-26 enhanced the abundance of Actinobacteria but reduced the abundance of Cyanobacteria, with P.lilacinus CS-Z exhibiting similar effects. Additionally, the treatment with B.pumilus Y-26 resulted in increased abundances of Crossiella, Gaiella, Bacillus, and Streptomyces at the genus level, while the treatment with P.lilacinus CS-Z showed increased abundances of Crossiella and Streptomyces. In contrast, the abundance of Pseudarthrobacter was reduced in the treatment with B.pumilus Y-26. Conversely, the application of the nematicide fosthiazate exhibited minor influence on the bacterial community. The findings indicated that the application of P.lilacinus CS-Z and B.pumilus Y-26 led to an increase in the relative abundances of beneficial microorganisms, including Gaiella, Bacillus, and Streptomyces, in the rhizosphere soil. In conclusion, P.lilacinus CS-Z and B.pumilus Y-26 demonstrated their potential as environmentally friendly biocontrol agents for managing stem nematode disease of sweet potato.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the responses of sweet potatoes to Cadmium (Cd) stress through pot experiments to theoretically substantiate their comprehensive applications in Cd-polluted agricultural land. The experiments included a CK treatment and three Cd stress treatments with 3, 30, and 150 mg/kg concentrations, respectively. We analyzed specified indicators of sweet potato at different growth periods, such as the individual plant growth, photosynthesis, antioxidant capacity, and carbohydrate Cd accumulation distribution. On this basis, the characteristics of the plant carbon metabolism in response to Cd stress throughout the growth cycle were explored. The results showed that T2 and T3 treatments inhibited the vine growth, leaf area expansion, stem diameter elongation, and tuberous root growth of sweet potato; notably, T3 treatment significantly increased the number of sweet potato branches. Under Cd stress, the synthesis of chlorophyll in sweet potato was significantly suppressed, and the Rubisco activity experienced significant reductions. With the increasing Cd concentration, the function of PS II was also affected. The soluble sugar content underwent no significant change in low Cd concentration treatments. In contrast, it decreased significantly under high Cd concentrations. Additionally, the tuberous root starch content decreased significantly with the increase in Cd concentration. Throughout the plant growth, the activity levels of catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase increased significantly in T2 and T3 treatments. By comparison, the superoxide dismutase activity in T1 treatment was significantly lower than that of CK. With the increasing application of Cd, its accumulation accordingly increased in various sweet potato organs. The the highest bioconcentration factor was detected in absorbing roots, while the tuberous roots had a lower bioconcentration factor and Cd accumulation. Moreover, the transfer factor from stem to petiole was the highest of the potato organs. These results demonstrated that sweet potatoes had a high Cd tolerance and a restoration potential for Cd-contaminated farmland.",

However, few works evaluate their nutritional and digestibility. The current work aimed to evaluate the effect of four pre-frying treatments (soaking, blanching, pulsed electric field (PEF) and PEF + blanching combination (PEFB)) on the chemical composition, anthocyanins, acrylamide, and digestive behavior (starch hydrolysis and anthocyanins bioaccessibility) of purple sweet potato deep-fried chips. In total 15 independent batches were made, three for each studied treatment (also a control without pretreatment was developed). The studied pretreatments impacted on fat and starch content, especially blanching and PEFB, which caused an increase in fat absorption and break starch, generating maltodextrins. Nineteen anthocyanins were detected, mainly cyanidin and peonidin derivatives, but a drastic loss was observed in blanched, PEF-treated and PEF-B-Treated chips. Acrylamide values ranged from 504.11 to 6350.0- μg/kg, with the highest values reported by untreated chips and the lowest by PEF-B-treated chips (p < 0.05). The anthocyanin's bioaccessibility ranged between 66.57 and 92.88%, with soaked chips that showed the highest values.",

      "abstract": "Poultry manure (PM) has demonstrated its potential to enhance crop nutritional quality. Nevertheless, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding its synergistic effects when combined with wood biochar (B) on the nutrient concentrations in sweet potato leaves (Ipomoea batatas L.) and the mineral content stored in sweet potato storage roots. Hence, a two-year field trial was undertaken during the 2019 and 2020 cropping seasons in southwestern Nigeria, spanning two locations (Owo-site A and Obasooto-site B), to jointly apply poultry manure and wood biochar as soil amendments aimed at enhancing the nutritional quality of sweet potato crop. Each year, the experiment involved different combinations of poultry manure at rates of 0, 5.0, and 10.0 t ha-1 and biochar at rates of 0, 10.0, 20.0, and 30.0 t ha-1, organized in a 3 × 4 factorial layout. The results of the present study demonstrated that the individual application of poultry manure (PM), biochar (B), or their combination had a significant positive impact on the nutrient composition of sweet potato leaves and minerals stored in the sweet potato storage roots, with notable synergistic effects between poultry manure and biochar (PM × B) in enhancing these parameters. This highlights the potential of biochar to enhance the efficiency of poultry manure utilization and improve nutrient utilization from poultry manure. The highest application rate of poultry manure at 10.0 t ha-1 and biochar at 30.0 t ha-1 (PM10 + B30), resulted in the highest leaf nutrient concentrations and mineral composition compared to other treatments at both sites. Averaged over two years, the highest application rate of poultry manure at 10.0 t ha-1 and biochar at 30.0 t ha-1 (PM10 + B30) significantly increased sweet potato leaf nutrient concentrations: nitrogen by 88.2%, phosphorus by 416.7%, potassium by 123.8%, calcium by 927.3%, and magnesium by 333.3%, compared to those in the control (PM0 + B0). The same treatment increased the concentration of sweet potato root storage minerals: phosphorus by 152.5%, potassium by 77.4%, calcium by 205.5%, magnesium by 294.6%, iron by 268.4%, zinc by 228.6%, and sodium by 433.3%, compared to the control. The highest application rate of poultry manure at 10.0 t ha-1 and biochar at 30.0 t ha-1 yielded the highest economic profitability in terms of gross margin (44,034 US$ ha-1), net return (30,038 US$ ha-1) and return rate or value-to-cost ratio (VCR) (263). The results suggested that the application of poultry manure at 10 t ha-1 and biochar at 30 t ha-1 is economically profitable in the study areas and under similar agroecological zones and soil conditions.",

      "abstract": "Sweet potato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam], the crop with the seventh highest annual production globally, is susceptible to various adverse environmental influences, and the study of stress-resistant genes is important for improving its tolerance to abiotic stress. The enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) is indispensable in the one pathway for synthesizing trehalose in plants. TPS is known to participate in stress response in plants, but information on TPS in sweet potato is limited. This study produced the N-terminal truncated IbTPS1 gene (△NIbTPS1) overexpression lines of Arabidopsis thaliana and sweet potato. Following salt and mannitol-induced drought treatment, the germination rate, root elongation, and fresh weight of the transgenic A. thaliana were significantly higher than that in the wild type. Overexpression of △NIbTPS1 elevated the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) and the activity of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase in sweet potato during drought and salt treatments, while reducing malondialdehyde and O2∙- contents, although expression of the trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase gene IbTPP and trehalose concentrations were not affected. Thus, overexpressing the △NIbTPS1 gene can improve the stress tolerance of sweet potato to drought and salt by enhancing the photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidative enzyme system. These results will contribute to understand the functions of the △NIbTPS1 gene and trehalose in the response mechanism of higher plants to abiotic stress.",

However, the functions of few SAUR genes are known in the root development of sweet potatoes. In this study, an IbSAUR36 gene was cloned and functionally analyzed. The IbSAUR36 protein was localized to the nucleus and plasma membrane. The transcriptional level of this gene was significantly higher in the pencil root and leaf.This gene was strongly induced by indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), but it was downregulated under methyl-jasmonate(MeJA) treatment. The promoter of IbSAUR36 contained the core cis-elements for phytohormone responsiveness. Promoter β-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis in Arabidopsis showed that IbSAUR36 is highly expressed in the young tissues of plants, such as young leaves, roots, and buds. IbSAUR36-overexpressing sweet potato roots were obtained by an efficient Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated root transgenic system. We demonstrated that overexpression of IbSAUR36 promoted the accumulation of IAA, upregulated the genes encoding IAA synthesis and its signaling pathways, and downregulated the genes encoding lignin synthesis and JA signaling pathways. Taken together, these results show that IbSAUR36 plays an important role in adventitious root (AR) development by regulating IAA signaling, lignin synthesis, and JA signaling pathways in transgenic sweet potatoes.",

Although the MYB gene family has been studied in many plant species, there is still little known about the function of R2R3 MYB TFs in sweet potato in response to abiotic stresses. In this study, an R2R3 MYB gene, IbMYB330 was isolated from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). IbMYB330 was ectopically expressed in tobacco and the functional characterization was performed by overexpression in transgenic plants. The IbMYB330 protein has a 268 amino acid sequence and contains two highly conserved MYB domains. The molecular weight and isoelectric point of IbMYB330 are 29.24 kD and 9.12, respectively. The expression of IbMYB330 in sweet potato is tissue-specific, and levels in the root were significantly higher than that in the leaf and stem. It showed that the expression of IbMYB330 was strongly induced by PEG-6000, NaCl, and H2O2. Ectopic expression of IbMYB330 led to increased transcript levels of stress-related genes such as SOD, POD, APX, and P5CS. Moreover, compared to the wild-type (WT), transgenic tobacco overexpression of IbMYB330 enhanced the tolerance to drought and salt stress treatment as CAT activity, POD activity, proline content, and protein content in transgenic tobacco had increased, while MDA content had decreased. Taken together, our study demonstrated that IbMYB330 plays a role in enhancing the resistance of sweet potato to stresses. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on the R2R3-MYB genes of sweet potato and indicates that IbMYB330 may be a candidate gene for improving abiotic stress tolerance in crops.",

      "abstract": "Sufficient soil moisture is required to ensure the successful transplantation of sweet potato seedlings. Thus, reasonable water management is essential for achieving high quality and yield in sweet potato production. We conducted field experiments in northern China, planted on 18 May and harvested on 18 October 2021, at the Nancun Experimental Base of Qingdao Agricultural University. Three water management treatments were tested for sweet potato seedlings after transplanting: hole irrigation (W1), optimized drip irrigation (W2), and traditional drip irrigation (W3). The variation characteristics of soil volumetric water content, soil temperature, and soil CO2 concentration in the root zone were monitored in situ for 0-50 days. The agronomy, root morphology, photosynthetic parameters, 13C accumulation, yield, and yield components of sweet potato were determined. The results showed that soil VWC was maintained at 22-25% and 27-32% in the hole irrigation and combined drip irrigation treatments, respectively, from 0 to 30 days after transplanting. However, there was no significant difference between the traditional (W3) and optimized (W2) drip irrigation systems. From 30 to 50 days after transplanting, the VWC decreased significantly in all treatments, with significant differences among all treatments. Soil CO2 concentrations were positively correlated with VWC from 0 to 30 days after transplanting but gradually increased from 30 to 50 days, with significant differences among treatments. Soil temperature varied with fluctuations in air temperature, with no significant differences among treatments. Sweet potato survival rates were significantly lower in the hole irrigation treatments than in the drip irrigation treatments, with no significant difference between W2 and W3. The aboveground biomass, photosynthetic parameters, and leaf area index were significantly higher under drip irrigation than under hole irrigation, and values were higher in W3 than in W2. However, the total root length, root volume, and 13C partitioning rate were higher in W2 than in W3. These findings suggest that excessive drip irrigation can lead to an imbalance in sweet potato reservoir sources. Compared with W1, the W2 and W3 treatments exhibited significant yield increases of 42.98% and 36.49%, respectively. The W2 treatment had the lowest sweet potato deformity rate."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the applicability of the Peleg model to the osmotic dehydration of various sweet potato variety samples in sugar beet molasses, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature. The osmotic dehydration was performed using an 80% sugar beet molasses solution at temperatures of 20 °C, 35 °C, and 50 °C for periods of 1, 3, and 5 h. The sample-to-solution ratio was 1:5. The objectives encompassed evaluating the Peleg equation's suitability for modeling mass transfer during osmotic dehydration and determining equilibrium water and solid contents at various temperatures. With its modified equation, the Peleg model accurately described water loss and solid gain dynamics during osmotic treatment, as evidenced by a high coefficient of determination value (r2) ranging from 0.990 to 1.000. Analysis of Peleg constants revealed temperature and concentration dependencies, aligning with previous observations. The Guggenheim, Anderson, and de Boer (GAB) model was employed to characterize sorption isotherms, yielding coefficients comparable to prior studies. Effective moisture diffusivity and activation energy calculations further elucidated the drying kinetics, with effective moisture diffusivity values ranging from 1.85 × 10-8 to 4.83 × 10-8 m2/s and activation energy between 7.096 and 16.652 kJ/mol. These findings contribute to understanding the complex kinetics of osmotic dehydration and provide insights into the modeling and optimization of dehydration processes for sweet potato samples, with implications for food processing and preservation methodologies."

      "abstract": "KNOXs, a type of homeobox genes that encode atypical homeobox proteins, play an essential role in the regulation of growth and development, hormonal response, and abiotic stress in plants. However, the KNOX gene family has not been explored in sweet potato. In this study, through sequence alignment, genomic structure analysis, and phylogenetic characterization, 17, 12 and 11 KNOXs in sweet potato (I. batatas, 2n = 6x = 90) and its two diploid relatives I. trifida (2n = 2x = 30) and I. triloba (2n = 2x = 30) were identified. The protein physicochemical properties, chromosome localization, phylogenetic relationships, gene structure, protein interaction network, cis-elements of promoters, tissue-specific expression and expression patterns under hormone treatment and abiotic stresses of these 40 KNOX genes were systematically studied. IbKNOX4, -5, and - 6 were highly expressed in the leaves of the high-yield varieties Longshu9 and Xushu18. IbKNOX3 and IbKNOX8 in Class I were upregulated in initial storage roots compared to fibrous roots. IbKNOXs in Class M were specifically expressed in the stem tip and hardly expressed in other tissues. Moreover, IbKNOX2 and - 6, and their homologous genes were induced by PEG/mannitol and NaCl treatments. The results showed that KNOXs were involved in regulating growth and development, hormone crosstalk and abiotic stress responses between sweet potato and its two diploid relatives. This study provides a comparison of these KNOX genes in sweet potato and its two diploid relatives and a theoretical basis for functional studies.",

      "abstract": "Salinity stress significantly hinders plant growth by disrupting osmotic balance and inhibiting nutrient uptake, leading to reduced biomass and stunted development. Using saponin (SAP) and boron (B) can effectively overcome this issue. Boron decreases salinity stress by stabilizing cell walls and membranes, regulating ion balance, activating antioxidant enzymes, and enhancing water uptake. SAP are bioactive compounds that have the potential to alleviate salinity stress by improving nutrient uptake, modulating plant hormone levels, promoting root growth, and stimulating antioxidant activity. That's why the current study was planned to use a combination of SAP and boron as amendments to mitigate salinity stress in sweet potatoes. Four levels of SAP (0%, 0.1%, 0.15%, and 0.20%) and B (control, 5, 10, and 20 mg/L B) were applied in 4 replications following a completely randomized design. Results illustrated that 0.15% SAP with 20 mg/L B caused significant enhancement in sweet potato vine length (13.12%), vine weight (12.86%), root weight (8.31%), over control under salinity stress. A significant improvement in sweet potato chlorophyll a (9.84%), chlorophyll b (20.20%), total chlorophyll (13.94%), photosynthetic rate (17.69%), transpiration rate (16.03%), and stomatal conductance (17.59%) contrast to control under salinity stress prove the effectiveness of 0.15% SAP + 20 mg/L B treatment. In conclusion, 0.15% SAP + 20 mg/L B is recommended to mitigate salinity stress in sweet potatoes.",

The results indicated that Ecaishu No. 10 (EC10) provided better retention capacity for phenolic compounds after drying. Furthermore, polyphenols were progressively released from the matrix as the digestion process proceeded. The highest bioaccessibility of polyphenols was found in EC10 intestinal chyme at 48.47%. For its phenolic profile, 3-, 4-, and 5-monosubstituted caffeoyl quinic acids were 9.75%, 57.39%, and 79.37%, respectively, while 3,4-, 3,5-, and 4,5-disubstituted caffeoyl quinic acids were 6.55, 0.27 and 13.18%, respectively. In contrast, the 3,4-, 3,5-, 4,5-disubstituted caffeoylquinic acid in the intestinal fluid after dialysis bag treatment was 62.12%, 79.12%, and 62.98%, respectively, which resulted in relatively enhanced bioactivities (DPPH, 10.51 μmol Trolox/g; FRAP, 8.89 μmol Trolox/g; ORAC, 7.32 μmol Trolox/g; IC50 for α-amylase, 19.36 mg/g; IC50 for α-glucosidase, 25.21 mg/g). In summary, desirable phenolic acid release characteristics and bioactivity of EC10 were observed in this study, indicating that it has potential as a functional food ingredient, which is conducive to the exploitation of the sweet potato processing industry from a long-term perspective."

      "abstract": "This study assesses the impact of dual modification [octenyl succinylation (OSA) and heat-moisture treatment (HMT)] of sweet potato starch (SPS) on the physicochemical, mechanical, and permeability properties of SPS film. The intrinsic limitations of starch films, such as sensitivity to high humidity, inferior mechanical properties, and weak barrier capabilities, have restricted their use in sausage casings. Nonetheless, the dual-modified SPS film (OSA@HMT-SPS film) demonstrated significantly reduced solubility (P < 0.05), moisture content, water vapor permeability (WVP), and O2 permeability compared to the SPS film. Furthermore, its flexibility and elasticity, indicated by its elongation at break, was notably superior. When used as sausage casings, the OSA@HMT-SPS film effectively mitigated lipid oxidation in sausages better than both the SPS film and commercial collagen casings, owing to its low O2 permeability. As a result, the OSA@HMT-SPS casing presents significant promise as a plant-based sausage casing alternative."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of different proportions of dietary fermented sweet potato residue (FSPR) supplementation as a substitute for corn on the nutrient digestibility, meat quality, and intestinal microbes of yellow-feathered broilers. Experiment 1 (force-feeding) evaluated the nutrient composition and digestibility of mixtures with different proportions of sweet potato residue (70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%) before and after fermentation. In Experiment 2 (metabolic growth), a total of 420 one-day-old yellow-feathered broilers were randomly allocated to 4 groups and fed corn-soybean meal-based diets with 0, 5%, 8%, and 10% FSPR as a substitute for corn. The force-feeding and metabolic growth experiments were performed for 9 and 70 d, respectively. The treatment of 70% sweet potato residue (after fermentation) had the highest levels of crude protein, ether extract, and crude fiber and improved the digestibility of crude protein and amino acids (P < 0.05). Although dietary FSPR supplementation at different levels had no significant effect on growth performance and intestinal morphology, it improved slaughter rate, half-chamber rate, full clearance rate, and meat color, as well as reduced cooking loss in the breast and thigh muscles (P < 0.05). Dietary supplementation with 8% and 10% FSPR increased the serum immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G levels in broilers (P < 0.05). Furthermore, 10% FSPR increased the Shannon index and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Romboutsia abundances and decreased Sutterella and Megamonas abundances (P < 0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that meat color was positively correlated with Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with Megamonas (P < 0.05). Collectively, 70% sweet potato residue (after fermentation) had the best nutritional value and nutrient digestibility. Dietary supplementation with 8% to 10% FSPR as a substitute for corn can improve the slaughter performance, meat quality, and intestinal microbe profiles of broilers. Our findings suggest that FSPR has the potential to be used as a substitute for corn-soybean meals to improve the meat quality and intestinal health of broilers."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a prevalent liver disease that can potentially lead to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. The prolonged administration of immunosuppressive medications carries significant risks for patients. Purple sweet potato polysaccharide (PSPP), a macromolecule stored in root tubers, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune-enhancing, and intestinal flora-regulating properties. Nevertheless, investigation into the role and potential mechanisms of PSPP in AIH remains notably scarce. PURPOSE: Our aim was to explore the possible protective impacts of PSPP against concanavalin A (Con A)-induced liver injury in mice. METHODS: Polysaccharide was isolated from purple sweet potato tubers using water extraction and alcohol precipitation, followed by purification through DEAE-52 cellulose column chromatography and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography. A highly purified component was obtained, and its monosaccharide composition was characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mouse and cellular models induced by Con A were set up to investigate the impacts of PSPP on hepatic histopathology, apoptosis, as well as inflammation- and oxidative stress-related proteins in response to PSPP treatment. RESULTS: The administration of PSPP significantly reduced hepatic pathological damage, suppressed elevation of ALT and AST levels, and attenuated hepatic apoptosis in Con A-exposed mice. PSPP was found to mitigate Con A-induced inflammation by suppressing the TLR4-P2X7R/NLRP3 signaling pathway in mice. Furthermore, PSPP alleviated Con A-induced oxidative stress by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in mice. Additionally, PSPP demonstrated the ability to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells induced by Con A in vitro. CONCLUSION: PSPP has the potential to ameliorate hepatic inflammation via the TLR4-P2X7R/NLRP3 pathway and inhibit hepatic oxidative stress through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway during the progression of Con A-induced hepatic injury. The results of this study have unveiled the potential hepatoprotective properties of purple sweet potato and its medicinal value for humans. Moreover, this study serves as a valuable reference, highlighting the potential of PSPP-1 as a drug candidate for the treatment of immune liver injury.",

A high correlation was observed between antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content. Deep-frying treatment resulted in higher antioxidant capacity with increasing heating time. The major phenolic components of raw sweet potat were 5-caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (diCQA), which were reduced by heat treatment due to the isomerization of 5-CAQ to 3- and 4-CQA, and 3,5-diCQA to 3,4- and 4,5-diCQA. Moreover, 5-CQA was more stable than 3,5-diCQA even at 100 °C. Our results demonstrated that by controlling the cooking temperature and time, new bioactive compounds such as mono- and diCQA derivatives can be produced from sweet potato. These data indicate a potential approach for the development of new functional foods from sweet potato by controlling cooking temperature and time."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of freezing at different temperatures (-20 °C, -40 °C, -80 °C) for14 h and freezing times (1 and 2 times) on the cellular structure of purple sweet potato and the quality of RFEP chips. The analysis of cell microstructure, conductivity, and rheology revealed that higher freezing temperatures and more freezing times resulted in increased damage to the cellular structure, leading to greater cell membrane permeability and decreased cell wall stiffness. However, excessive damage to cellular structure caused tissue structure to collapse. Compared with the control group (4 °C), the RFEP sample pre-frozen once at -40 °C had a 47.13 % increase in puffing ratio and a 61.93 % increase in crispness, while hardness decreased by 23.44 % (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in anthocyanin retention or color difference. X-ray microtomography demonstrated that the RFEP sample pre-frozen once at -40 °C exhibited a more homogeneous morphology and uniform pore distribution, resulting in the highest overall acceptability. In conclusion, freezing pre-treatment before RFEP can significantly enhance the puffing quality, making this an effective method for preparing oil-free puffing products for fruits and vegetables.",

BP and SPV were chosen to replace maize and alfalfa hay, because, in addition to the ingredients having similar nutritional characteristics, they are among the most expensive ingredients in rabbit diets. Data were obtained through a biological assay carried out in the Cuniculture Laboratory of the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil. Fifty New Zealand white rabbits, weaned at 35 days of age, were fed during the growth phase (35 to 84 days) with increasing levels of BP and SPV, replacing maize and alfalfa hay (T0, T25, T50, T75 and T100% replacement). A diet containing 100% replacement (T100) had the lowest cost per kilogram, which was R$ 1.18/kg, while the controlled diet was 57% more expensive, costing R$ 2.08/kg. The total operating cost to produce a rabbit with control treatment was R$10.93/head and at T100, it was R$6.51/head. The animal income for a live rabbit was R$ 24.08 and R$ 23.95 in treatments T0 and T100, respectively. Regarding the gain margin per animal (GMA), in TO it was R$ 13.16 while in T100 it was R$ 17.44, therefore the GMA was 32.55% higher when using the T100 diet. In conclusion, it is more economical and feasible to feed rabbits with diets containing 100% BP and SPV, replacing maize and alfalfa hay.",

This underscores the need for extensive research to enhance crop yields under drought conditions, a priority for scientists given its vital role in global food security. Our study explores the effects of using humic and chitosan treatments to alleviate drought stress during critical growth phases and their impact on crop yield and water efficiency. We employed four different irrigation strategies: full irrigation, 70% irrigation at the early vine development stage, 70% irrigation during the storage root bulking stage, and 85% irrigation across both stages, complemented by full irrigation in other periods. The plants received either humic treatments through foliar spray or soil application, or chitosan foliar applications, with tap water serving as a control. Our findings highlight that the early vine development stage is particularly vulnerable to drought, with a 42.0% decrease in yield observed under such conditions. In normal growth scenarios, foliar application of humic substances significantly improved growth parameters, resulting in a substantial increase in yield and water efficiency by 66.9% and 68.4%, respectively, compared to the control treatment under full irrigation. For sweet potatoes irrigated with 70% water at the storage root bulking stage, ground application of humic substances outperformed both foliar applications of chitosan and humic in terms of yield results. The highest tuber yield and water efficiency were attained by combining chitosan and humic ground applications, regardless of whether 70% irrigation was used at the storage root bulking stage or 85% irrigation during both the early vine development and storage root bulking stages.",

      "abstract": "Increasing storage root number is a pivotal approach to enhance both storage root (SR) yield and appearance quality of sweet potato. Here, 2-year field experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of 0 (K0), 120 (K1), 240 (K2), and 360 (K3) kg ha-1 potassium fertilizer (K2O) on lignin metabolism, root growth, storage root yield, and uniformity. The results demonstrated that potassium (K) application led to a decrease in the activities of key enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis, including phenylalanine deaminase (PAL), 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase (4-CL), cinnamic acid dehydrogenase (CAD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and peroxidase (POD). This resulted in a significant reduction in lignin and G-type lignin contents in potential SRs compared to K0 treatment within 10-30 days after planting (DAP). BJ553 exhibited a significant decrease in PAL activity, as well as lignin and G-type contents at 10 DAP, whereas YS25 showed delayed effects until 20 DAP. However, the number and distribution of secondary xylem conduits as well as the mid-column diameter area in roots were increased in K2 treatment. Interestingly, K2 treatment exhibited significantly larger potential SR diameter than other treatments at 15, 20, and 25 DAP. At harvest, K2 treatment increased the SR number, the single SR weight, and overall yield greatly compared with K0 treatment, with an average increase of 19.12%, 16.54%, and 16.92% respectively. The increase of SR number in BJ553 was higher than that of YS25. Furthermore, K2 treatment exhibited the lowest coefficient of variation for both SR length and diameter, indicating a higher yield of middle-sized SRs. In general, appropriate potassium application could effectively suppress lignin biosynthesis, leading to a reduction in the degree of pericycle lignification in potential SRs. This promotes an increase in the number of storage roots and ultimately enhances both yield and appearance quality of sweet potato. The effect of potassium fertilizer on lignin metabolism in BJ553 roots was earlier and resulted in a greater increase in the SR number compared to YS25."

      "abstract": "Sweet potato is a crop that is widely consumed all over the world and is thought to contribute to health maintenance due to its abundant nutrients and phytochemicals. Previous studies on the functionality of sweet potatoes have focused on varieties that have colored pulp, such as purple and orange, which contain high levels of specific phytochemicals. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of light-yellow-fleshed sweet potatoes, which have received little attention. After freeze-drying sweet potatoes harvested in 2020, extracts were prepared from the leaves, stems, roots, and tubers in 100% ethanol. Mouse macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 cells were cultured with 10 µg/mL of the extracts and induced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation. Of the extracts, the tuber extracts showed the highest suppression of LPS-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression and production in RAW264.7, which was attributed to the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) oxidative stress response pathway. In addition, preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) experiments suggested that hydrophobic components specific to the tuber were the main body of activity. In previous studies, it has been shown that the tubers and leaves of sweet potatoes with colored pulp exhibit anti-inflammatory effects due to their rich phytochemicals, and our results show that the tubers with light-yellow pulp also exhibit the effects. Furthermore, we were able to show a part of the mechanism, which may contribute to the fundamental understanding of the treatment and prevention of inflammation by food-derived components.",

The results indicated that utilizing Cow manure in growing sweet potatoes significantly promoted root yield and root nutritional composition. Cow treatment produced the greatest number of roots compared to Bio, CM, SS, and the control treatments. The results also revealed that the concentrations of vitamin C (260. 3 µg g-1), β-carotene (45.4 µg g-1), soluble sugars (16.7 mg g-1), and total phenols (196.3 3 µg g-1 fresh roots) were greater in the roots of plants grown in Cow compared to the roots of the control treatment.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seasonal late-season water deficits negatively affect the yield and quality of sweet potatoes in northern China. However, the amount of late-season irrigation to achieve high yield and consistent quality storage root remains undetermined. We assessed the yield and some qualitative traits of sweet potatoes such as size, shape, skin/flesh colour and nutritional content, as influenced by five irrigation levels (T0: unirrigated control; T1: 33% ETc; T2: 75% ETc; T3: 100% ETc; and T4: 125% ETc). RESULTS: Late-season irrigation significantly increased yield and marketable yield. Yields for T2 and T3 were significantly higher than other treatments, whereas T2 had the highest Grade A rating in a 2-year test. The vertical length of storage roots gradually increased with an increase in irrigation level, whereas the maximum width remained unchanged. The proportion of long elliptic and elliptic storage roots also increased, whereas the proportion of ovate, obovate and round storage roots gradually decreased. The skin and flesh colours became more vivid as the level of irrigation increased, with the skin colour becoming redder and the flesh colour becoming more orange-yellow. The levels of carotenoids, vitamin C and soluble sugar were significantly higher in irrigated crops, with the highest vitamin C and soluble sugar levels in T2 and the highest carotenoid levels in T3 treatment. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of moderate irrigation in the late-season to improve both yield production and quality potential. The results are of great importance for improving the market value of sweet potatoes and increasing grower profits. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Lam. cv 'Pushu13') and Xinxiang (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. cv 'Xinxiang'). The growth in vitro and reproduction of Rhizopus stolonifer were significantly inhibited at 35 °C. However, it resumed when returned to suitable growth conditions. The heat treatment (at 35 °C for 24 h) was found to mitigate nutrient loss during storage while enhancing the structural characteristics and free radical scavenging capacity of sweet potato. Additionally, it led to increased enzyme activities for APX, PPO, and POD, alongside decreased activities for Cx and PG, thereby enhancing the disease resistance of sweet potato against soft rot. As a result, the heat treatment provided a theoretical basis for the prevention of sweet potato soft rot and had guiding significance for improving the resistance against sweet potato soft rot."

      "abstract": "Leafy sweet potato is a new type of sweet potato, whose leaves and stems are used as green vegetables. However, sweet potato tips can be affected by pre-harvest factors, especially the intensity of light. At present, intercropping, greenhouse planting, and photovoltaic agriculture have become common planting modes for sweet potato. Likewise, they can also cause insufficient light conditions or even low light stress. This research aimed to evaluate the influence of four different shading levels (no shading, 30%, 50%, and 70% shading degree) on the growth profile of sweet potato leaves. The net photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll pigments, carbohydrates, and polyphenol components were determined. Our findings displayed that shading reduced the content of the soluble sugar, starch, and sucrose of leaves, as well as the yield and Pn. The concentrations of Chl a, Chl b, and total Chl were increased and the Chl a/b ratio was decreased for the more efficient interception and absorption of light under shading conditions. In addition, 30% and 50% shading increased the total phenolic, total flavonoids, and chlorogenic acid. Transcriptome analysis indicated that genes related to the antioxidant, secondary metabolism of phenols and flavonoids, photosynthesis, and MAPK signaling pathway were altered in response to shading stresses. We concluded that 30% shading induced a high expression of antioxidant genes, while genes related to the secondary metabolism of phenols and flavonoids were upregulated by 50% shading. And the MAPK signaling pathway was modulated under 70% shading, and most stress-related genes were downregulated. Moreover, the genes involved in photosynthesis, such as chloroplast development, introns splicing, and Chlorophyll synthesis, were upregulated as shading levels increased. This research provides a new theoretical basis for understanding the tolerance and adaptation mechanism of leafy sweet potato in low light environments.",

      "abstract": "Starches from different botanical sources are affected in the presence of enzymes. This study investigated the impact of α-amylase on several properties of pre-gelatinized starches derived from chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), white beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas L.). Specifically, the water holding capacity, freezable water content, sugar content, and water sorption isotherm (adsorption and desorption) properties were examined. The source of α-amylase utilized in this study was a germinated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) extract (GSE). The starch samples were subjected to annealing at temperatures of 40, 50, and 60 °C for durations of either 30 or 60 min prior to the process of gelatinization. A significant increase in the annealing temperature and GSE resulted in a notable enhancement in both the water-holding capacity and the sugar content of the starch. The ordering of starches in terms of their freezable water content is as follows: Chickpea starch (C.P.S) > white beans starch (W.B.S) > wheat starch (W.S) > chickpea starch (C.S) > sweet potato starch (S.P.S). The Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) model was only employed for fitting the data, as the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model had a low root mean square error (RMSE). The application of annealing and GSE treatment resulted in a shift of the adsorption and desorption isotherms towards greater levels of moisture content. A strong hysteresis was found in the adsorption and desorption curves, notably within the water activity range of 0.6 to 0.8. The GSE treatment and longer annealing time had an impact on the monolayer water content (mo), as well as the C and K parameters of the GAB model, irrespective of the annealing temperature. These results can be used to evaluate the applicability of starch in the pharmaceutical and food sectors.",

Early development of storage roots is conducive to inhibiting vine overgrowth. Hence, we investigated how N and soil moisture affect early root growth and development. RESULTS: A pot experiment was conducted using the sweet potato cultivars Jishu26 (J26, N-susceptible) and Xushu32 (X32, N-tolerant). Two N application rates of 50 (N1) and 150 mg kg- 1 (N2) and two water regimes, drought stress (DS) (W1) and normal moisture (W2), were applied to each cultivar. For J26, the lowest expansion root weight was observed in the N2W2 treatment, while for X32, the N1W2 and N2W2 treatments resulted in higher root weights compared to other treatments. The interaction between N rates and water regimes significantly affected root surface area and volume in J26. Root cross-sections revealed that N2W2 increased the percentage of root area covered by xylem vessels and decreased the amount of secondary xylem vessels (SXV) in J26. However, in X32, it increased the number of SXV. A high N rate reduced the 13 C distribution ratio in J26 expansion roots, but had no significant effect on X32. In J26, N2W2 inhibited starch synthesis in roots by downregulating the expression of AGPa, AGPb, GBSS I, and SBE I. CONCLUSION: The observed effects were more pronounced in J26. For X32, relatively high N and moisture levels did not significantly impact storage root development. Therefore, special attention should be paid to N supply and soil moisture for N-susceptible cultivars during the early growth stage.",

The results showed that an appropriate planting density (D20 treatment) stimulated cambium cell differentiation, which increased carbohydrate accumulation and inhibited lignin biosynthesis in potential storage roots. At canopy closure, the D20 treatment produced more storage roots, particularly developing ones. It increased the yield by 10.18-19.73% compared with the control D25 treatment and improved the commercial features by decreasing the storage root length/diameter ratio and increasing the storage root weight uniformity.

The results indicate that daily feed intake, mass gain, and feed conversion were not statistically different from one another in the test groups compared to the control group treatment. In addition, the study shows no differences were observed in centesimal compositions and muscle color. The replacement of maize and alfalfa hay by the combination of BP and SPV resulted in reduction in feed costs, reaching 50% in the experimental diet with 100% of substitution the ingredients.

The conservation of preheating whey protein concentrate (WPC) on the stability of purple sweet potato ANs was investigated. The retention of ANs in WPC-ANs was 85.88% after storage at 25 °C for 5 h. WPC-ANs had higher retention of ANs in heating treatment. The retention rates of ANs in WPC-ANs exposed to light and UV lamps for 6 h were 78.72% and 85.76%, respectively. When the concentration of H2O2 was 0.50%, the retention rate of ANs in the complexes was 62.04%. WPC-ANs' stability and antioxidant activity were improved in simulated digestive juice. The WPC-ANs connection was static quenching, and the binding force between them was a hydrophobic interaction at one binding site, according to the fluorescence quenching spectroscopy. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis further indicated that the secondary structure and microenvironment of amino acid residues in WPC can be impacted by the preheating temperature and preheating times of WPC. In conclusion, preheating WPC can successfully preserve the stability of purple sweet potato ANs by binding to them through a non-covalent interaction."

      "abstract": "This study aims to provide an overview of the compounds found in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) that contribute to its anti-diabetic activity and the mechanisms by which they act. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct, with specific search terms and Boolean operators. A total of 269 articles were initially retrieved, but after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria only 28 articles were selected for further review. Among the findings, four varieties of sweet potato were identified as having potential anti-diabetic properties. Phenolic acids, flavonols, flavanones, and anthocyanidins are responsible for the anti-diabetic activity of sweet potatoes. The anti-diabetic mechanism of sweet potatoes was determined using a combination of components with multi-target actions. The results of these studies provide evidence that Ipomoea batatas is effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes."

      "abstract": "Studies have shown that targeting xanthine oxidase (XO) can be a feasible treatment for fructose-induced hyperuricemia and hyperglycemia. This study aimed to evaluate the dual regulatory effects and molecular mechanisms of diacylated anthocyanins from purple sweet potato (diacylated AF-PSPs) on hyperglycemia and hyperuricemia induced by a high-fructose/high-fat diet. The body weight, organ index, serum biochemical indexes, and liver antioxidant indexes of mice were measured, and the kidneys were observed in pathological sections. The relative expression levels of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of fructose metabolism pathway enzymes in kidney were detected by fluorescent real-time quantitative polymerase chain (qPCR) reaction technique, and the expression of renal transporter protein and inflammatory factor pathway protein was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) technique. Results showed that diacylated AF-PSPs alleviated hyperuricemia in mice, and that this effect might be related to the regulation of liver XO activity, lipid accumulation, and relevant renal transporters. Diacylated AF-PSPs reduced body weight and relieved lipid metabolism disorder, liver lipid accumulation, and liver oxidative stress, thereby enhancing insulin utilization and sensitivity, lowering blood sugar, and reducing hyperglycemia in mice. Also, diacylated AF-PSPs restored mRNA levels related to renal fructose metabolism, and reduced kidney injury and inflammation. This study provided experimental evidence for the mechanisms of dual regulation of blood glucose and uric acid (UA) by diacylated AF-PSPs and their utilization as functional foods in the management of metabolic syndrome.",

However, the functional analysis of KT/HAK/KUP members in sweet potatoes is still limited. The present work reported the physiological activity of a new gene, IbHAK11, in the KT/HAK/KUP family in sweet potatoes. IbHAK11 expression increased significantly in the low K+-tolerant line compared with the low K+-sensitive line following treatment with low K+ concentrations. IbHAK11 upregulation promoted root growth in Arabidopsis under low K+ conditions. Under high saline stress, transgenic lines had superior growth and photosynthetic characteristics compared with the wild-type (WT). As for IbHAK11-overexpressing plants, activation of both the non-enzymatic and enzymatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging systems was observed. Therefore, IbHAK11-overexpressing plants had lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and ROS levels (including H2O2 and O2-) compared with WT under salt-induced stress. We also found that under both low K+ and high salinity conditions, overexpression of IbHAK11 enhanced K+ translocation from the root to the shoot and decreased Na+ absorption in Arabidopsis. Consequently, IbHAK11 positively regulated K+ deficiency and high salinity stresses by regulating K+ translocation and Na+ uptake, thus maintaining K+/Na+ homeostasis in plants."

      "abstract": "ACTINs are structural proteins widely distributed in plants. They are the main components of microfilaments and participate in many crucial physiological activities, including the maintenance of cell shape and cytoplasmic streaming. Meanwhile, ACTIN, as a housekeeping gene, is widely used in qRT-PCR analyses of plants. However, ACTIN family genes have not been explored in the sweet potato. In this study, we identified 30, 39, and 44 ACTINs in the cultivated hexaploid sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas, 2n = 6x = 90) and its two diploid relatives, Ipomoea trifida (2n = 2x = 30) and Ipomoea triloba (2n = 2x = 30), respectively, via analysis of their genome structure and by phylogenetic characterization. These ACTINs were divided into six subgroups according to their phylogenetic relationships with Arabidopsis thaliana. The physiological properties of the protein, chromosome localization, phylogenetic relationship, gene structure, promoter cis-elements, protein interaction networks, and expression patterns of these 113 ACTINs were systematically investigated. The results suggested that homologous ACTINs are differentiated in the sweet potato and its two diploid relatives, and play various vital roles in plant growth, tuberous root development, hormone crosstalk, and abiotic stress responses. Some stable ACTINs that could be used as internal reference genes were found in the sweet potato and its two diploid relatives, e.g., IbACTIN18, -20, and -16.2; ItfACTIN2.2, -16, and -10; ItbACTIN18 and -19.1. This work provides a comprehensive comparison and furthers our understanding of the ACTIN genes in the sweet potato and its two diploid relatives, thereby supplying a theoretical foundation for their functional study and further facilitating the molecular breeding of sweet potatoes.",

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the beneficial effect of purple sweet potato anthocyanins (PSPA) on growth performance, oxidative status, immune response, intestinal morphology, and intestinal flora homeostasis in heat-stressed Wenchang chickens. A total of 100 Wenchang chickens (50-day-old) were randomly assigned to 5 groups, including the thermoneutral environment (TN) group (26°C); high-temperature stressed (HS) group (33°C ± 1°C); low-dose PSPA treatment (L_HS) group (8 mg/kg body weight, 33°C ± 1°C); medium-dose PSPA treatment (M_HS) group and high-dose PSPA treatment (H_HS) group (16 mg/kg and 32 mg/kg body weight, respectively, 33°C ± 1°C). The results showed that PSPA reversed the adverse effects of heat stress on growth performance, meat quality, and carcass characteristics. And the effect was associated with the concentration of PSPA partially. Heat stress increased the serum lipids of Wenchang chickens. LDL-C, TG, TC, and FFA in the serum were significantly decreased, and HDL-C and LPS in the serum were increased by PSPA treatment. The digestive enzymes in duodenal chyme were significantly (P < 0.05) increased by PSPA treatment. And PSPA treatment significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced the redox status by improving antioxidant parameters (GSH-Px and SOD) and decreasing the MDA level in the serum and liver. Moreover, the level of inflammatory cytokines was significantly (P < 0.05) regulated by PSPA treatment compared to the HS group. The villus length and goblet cell numbers after PSPA treatment were significantly higher than HS group. Furthermore, PSPA also played protection on the intestine structure by decreasing the level of D-LA and DAO. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed the microbial composition was altered by PSPA, and Acetanaerobacterium and Oscillibacter were dominant in the H_HS group. Microbial functional prediction indicated that function pathways based on KEGG and metacyc database were regulated by PSPA, and intestinal flora correlated with metabolic function significantly. The spearman correlation analysis showed that Saccharibacteria and Clostridium_IV correlated with the serum lipids, antioxidant, and inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these findings suggest that PSPA has a positive effect against heat stress in poultry.",

The results demonstrated that pretreatment significantly reduced the moisture ratio and oil content by 25% and 40.33%, respectively. The total color change ΔE value of the pretreated samples was lower than that of the untreated samples. In addition, pretreatment increased the hardness of the sample after frying, and the AA content in the fried samples pretreated with PEF + blanching was reduced by approximately 46.10% (638 μg/kg). Finally, fried sweet potato chips obtained by the combined pretreatment exhibited a smoother and flatter cross-sectional microstructure."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We unravel the effect of anthocyanin-containing purple sweet potato synbiotic yogurt (PSPY) on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and its fundamental molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Molecular docking simulation was performed to observe and identify the affinity and interaction between bioactive compounds and targeted proteins. MDI (isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin)-containing medium, a cocktail that stimulates adipogenesis, was used in this study. The toxic effect possibility of the yogurt product was evaluated using 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2.5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. A 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, and 5% (v/v) plain or purple sweet potato yogurt supernatant was given to 3T3-L1 preadipocyte culture medium from 24 h after seeding until day 11 of MDI-induced differentiation. The mRNA expression and lipid accumulation were analyzed using RT-qPCR and Oil red O staining, respectively, on day 11 after differentiation induction. RESULTS: In silico study suggested that anthocyanin-derived compounds have the potential to inhibit peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), a master regulator for white adipogenesis. Anthocyanin-containing PSPY significantly suppressed the expression of Pparg, Adipoq, Slc2a4, and Pgc1a. PSPY significantly suppressed Pparg with 1% and 5% concentrations, while with a concentration of 0.25%, PSPY significantly suppressed Adipoq expression as compared to control. Significant inhibition of Slc2a4 and Pgc1a was observed starting from a 0.25% concentration of PSPY. The suppression of adipogenic genes was also observed with the treatment of plain yogurt; however, the effects were relatively lower than the PSPY. The group treated with 1% and 5% of PSPY also showed inhibition effects on lipid accumulation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated PSPY inhibition effect on white adipocyte differentiation through suppression of Pparg and its downstream genes, Adipoq and Slc2a4, indicating the potential of this yogurt as a functional food for obesity management and prevention."

      "abstract": "Purple sweet potato (PSP) powder with anthocyanins possesses the ability to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. Studies have presumed a positive correlation between body fat and dry eye disease (DED) in adults. The regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation has been proposed as the mechanism underlying DED. This study developed an animal model of high fat diet (HFD)-induced DED. We added 5% PSP powder to the HFD to evaluate the effects and underlying mechanisms in mitigating HFD-induced DED. A statin drug, atorvastatin, was also added to the diet separately to assess its effect. The HFD altered the structure of lacrimal gland (LG) tissue, reduced LG secretory function, and eliminated the expression of proteins related to DED development, including α-smooth muscle actin and aquaporin-5. Although PSP treatment could not significantly reduce body weight or body fat, it ameliorated the effects of DED by preserving LG secretory function, preventing ocular surface erosion, and preserving LG structure. PSP treatment increased superoxide dismutase levels but reduced hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α levels, indicating that PSP treatment reduced oxidative stress. PSP treatment increased ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 levels in LG tissue, signifying that PSP treatment regulated lipid homeostasis maintenance to reduce the effects of DED. In conclusion, PSP treatment ameliorated the effects of HFD-induced DED through the regulation of oxidative stress and lipid homeostasis in the LG.",

The SDF content increased from 2.21 to 4.04 g/100 g (in dry basis) during 20 min of steaming. The microcosmic morphology of the fractured cell wall indicated the release of SDF components during steaming. The SDF from fresh (SDF-F) and 20 min steamed (SDF-S) sweet potato was characterized. The neutral carbohydrates and uronic acid levels in SDF-S were significantly higher than SDF-F (59.31% versus 46.83%, and 25.36% versus 9.60%, respectively) (p < 0.05). The molecular weight of SDF-S was smaller than SDF-F (5.32 kDa versus 28.79 kDa). The probiotic property was evaluated by four Lactobacillus spp. fermentation in vitro with these SDF as carbon source, using inulin as the references. SDF-F showed the best proliferation effects on the four Lactobacillus spp. in terms of the OD600 and pH in cultures, and the highest production of propanoic acid and butyric acid after 24 h fermentation. SDF-S presented higher Lactobacillus proliferation effects, but slight lower propanoic acid and butyric acid production than inulin. It was concluded that 20 min of steaming released SDF with inferior probiotic properties, which might derive from the degraded pectin, cell wall components, and resistant dextrin."

The total free sugar and glucose contents of the hydrolysate were found to increase during the enzyme treatment. However, no differences in the moisture, total soluble solids, or textural properties were found among the sweet potato cultivars. Sinjami had high total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of 446.14 mg GAE/100 g and 243.59 mg CE/100 g, respectively, and it had the highest antioxidant activity among the cultivars. Based on the sensory evaluation, an overall preference appeared in the order of Daeyumi, Sinjami, and Juwhangmi cultivars. This result shows that jelly can be manufactured by saccharifying sweet potatoes, and it was confirmed that the characteristics of raw sweet potatoes had a great influence on the quality characteristics of the jelly. Further, the characteristics of raw sweet potatoes had a remarkable influence on the quality characteristics of the jelly."

(white-skinned sweet potato, WSSP) has been reported to help manage type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans and animals; however, the mechanisms of blood glucose regulation by WSSP remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the acute effects of WSSP on blood glucose homeostasis under normal conditions and the underlying mechanisms. Three fractions of WSSP (≤10, 10-50, and >50 kDa) were obtained via ultracentrifugation. Rats were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after a single administration of WSSP. The insulin tolerance test (ITT) and pyruvate tolerance test (PTT) were performed to evaluate insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis, respectively. Single WSSP administration markedly reduced blood glucose levels as revealed by the OGTT. Serum insulin levels were not increased by WSSP treatment. Blood glucose levels during ITT were significantly reduced due to WSSP treatment. WSSP treatment activated the phosphorylation of Akt, thereby activating insulin signaling in the skeletal muscles and liver. The ≤10 kDa fraction considerably reduced blood glucose levels per the OGTT and ITT. In contrast, gluconeogenesis in PTT and the expression of key enzymes in hepatocytes were suppressed by the >50 kDa fraction. This study demonstrated that WSSP acutely reduced postprandial blood glucose levels by improving insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscles in normal rats, which was attributed to constituents with a molecular weight of ≤10 kDa. Moreover, WSSP treatment suppressed gluconeogenesis in the liver, for which constituents of >50 kDa were responsible. Thus, WSSP can acutely regulate blood glucose homeostasis via multiple mechanisms. Since postprandial hyperglycemia leads to the onset of T2DM, WSSP, as a functional food, may possess potential active compounds that prevent T2DM."

      "abstract": "In this study, the influences of long-term soil drought with three levels [soil-relative water content (SRWC) (75 ± 5)%, as the control; SRWC (55 ± 5)%, mild drought; SRWC (45 ± 5)%, severe drought] were investigated on sucrose-starch metabolism in sweet potato tuberous roots (TRs) by pot experiment. Compared to the control, drought stress increased soluble sugar and sucrose content by 4-60% and 9-75%, respectively, but reduced starch accumulation by 30-66% through decreasing the starch accumulate rate in TRs. In the drought-treated TRs, the inhibition of sucrose decomposition was attributed to the reduced activities of acid invertase (AI) and alkaline invertase (AKI) and the IbA-INV3 expression, rather than sucrose synthase (SuSy), consequently leading to the increased sucrose content in TRs. In addition, starch synthesis was inhibited mainly by reducing ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), granular starch synthase (GBSS) and starch branching enzyme (SBE) activities in TRs under drought stress, and AGPase was the rate-limiting enzyme. Furthermore, soil drought remarkably up-regulated the IbSWEET11, IbSWEET605, and IbSUT4 expressions in Jishu 26 TRs, while it down-regulated or had no significant differences in Xushu 32 and Ningzishu 1 TRs. These results suggested that the sucrose-loading capability in Jishu 26 TRs were stronger than that in Xushu 32 and Ningzishu 1 TRs. Moreover, IbA-INV3, IbAGPS1, IbAGPS2, IbGBSSI and IbSBEII play important roles in different drought-tolerant cultivars under drought stress.",

      "abstract": "The available phosphorus (P) in acid sulfate soils (ASSs) is low because of fixation by aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe), resulting in decreased P use efficiency and crop yield. At present, the use of dicarboxylic acid polymer (DCAP) coated on P fertilizer is expected to improve P use efficiency and plant productivity. However, the influence of DCAP on P solubility and on the yield of sweet potato cultivated in acidic soils has not been elucidated. Thus, the aimed of this study was to evaluate the effect of the use of DCAP-coated P fertilizer on the availability and nutrient uptake of P as well as the yield of sweet potato. Under the greenhouse condition, the use of DCAP significantly improved P availability (~3 mg P kg-1), increasing tuber diameter and length by ~0.5 and ~1.0 cm, respectively. Thus, the productivity of sweet potato in the treatment 40-kg P2O5 and 60-kg P2O5 ha-1 coated with DCAP was higher by about 100 g pot-1 than that in the same rate of P fertilizers (40- and 60-kg P2O5 ha-1) not coated with DCAP. In the field experiment, P accumulation (82.7 kg P2O5 ha-1) and tuber yield (22.0 t ha-1) in the treatment of DCAP-coated with 60-kg P2O5 ha-1 were not significantly different compared with that in the treatment of 80-kg P2O5 ha-1 (82.1 kg P2O5 and 21.7 t ha-1, respectively). Furthermore, the use of DCAP combined with 75% P fertilizer increased the P availability by the same amount as that with the use of 100% P fertilizer. Hence, the use of DCAP reduced about 25% of the chemical P fertilizer applied in soil.",

TCS genes have been comprehensively identified in various plants, while studies on the genome-wide identification and analysis of TCS in sweet potato were still not reported. Therefore, in this study, a total of 90 TCS members consisting of 20 HK(L)s, 11 HPs, and 59 RRs were identified in the genome of Ipomoea batatas. Furthermore, their gene structures, conserved domains, and phylogenetic relationships were analyzed in detail. Additionally, the gene expression profiles in various organs were analyzed, and response patterns to adverse environmental stresses were investigated. The results showed that these 90 TCS genes were mapped on 15 chromosomes with a notably uneven distribution, and the expansion of TCS genes in sweet potato was attributed to both segmental and tandem duplications. The majority of the TCS genes showed distinct organ-specific expression profiles, especially in three types of roots (stem roots, fibrous roots, tuberous roots). Moreover, most of the TCS genes were either induced or suppressed upon treatment with abiotic stresses (drought, salinity, cold, heat) and exogenous phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). In addition, the yeast-two hybrid system was used to reveal the HK-HP-RR protein-protein interactions. IbHP1, IbHP2, IbHP4, and IbHP5 could interact with three HKs (IbHK1a, IbHK1b, and IbHK5), and also interact with majority of the type-B RRs (IbRR20-IbRR28), while no interaction affinity was detected for IbHP3. Our systematic analyses could provide insights into the characterization of the TCS genes, and further the development of functional studies in sweet potato."

The optimised SPVPC exhibited abundant porous structures with a high specific surface area of 1397.8 m2 g-1. Moreover, SPVPC exhibited excellent adsorption characteristics for removing methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. The maximum adsorption capacity for MB reached 653.6 mg g-1, and the reusability was satisfactory. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm were in good agreement with the pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir models, respectively. The adsorption mechanism was summarised as the synergistic effects of the hierarchically porous structures in SPVPC and various interactions between SPVPC and MB. Considering its low cost and excellent adsorption performance, the prepared porous carbon is a promising adsorbent candidate for dye wastewater treatment."

      "abstract": "Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam), a member of the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae Juss.), is well known for its food, medicinal, and industrial values. It is estimated that more than 7000 sweet potato cultivars have been bred to date. Jewel sweet potato (I. batatas Lam cv. Jewel) is one of the most popular cultivars of sweet potato grown today because of its high nutritional value, delicious taste, and is suitable for all processing methods. However, little is known about the micropropagation of jewel sweet potato. The purpose of this paper was to study the effect of three important factors, including culture medium, plant growth regulators (PGRs), and artificial light sources, on the induction, proliferation, and growth of in vitro I. batatas 'Jewel' shoots obtained from the axillary bud and shoot tip explants. The different Murashige and Skoog (MS) salt levels (33%, 50%, 100%, and 150%) were used to study the influence of mineral treatment. To assess the influence of PGRs, we used 0.5 mg/L indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) combined with various cytokinins, including 0.5-2.0 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), 0.5-2.0 mg/L kinetin (Kn), and 0.1-1.0 mg/L thidiazuron (TDZ). On the other hand, the in vitro shoots were cultivated in a light room with different lighting conditions. Three lighting treatments (differences in the ratio between the red (R) and blue (B) spectra) were used. Research results have shown that the medium containing 50% MS salt concentration supplemented with 0.5 mg/L BAP or 0.5 mg/L Kn combined with 0.5 mg/L IAA was the most suitable for induction, proliferation, and growth of in vitro jewel sweet potato shoots. On the other hand, stem pieces bearing the axillary buds' explants were determined to be suitable for the shoot induction. Using artificial light with different blue/red ratios also had a significant effect on the growth of explants and stimulates shoot or root formation."

      "abstract": "The xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XET/XEH, also named XTH) family is a multigene family, the function of which plays a significant role in cell-wall rebuilding and stress tolerance in plants. However, the specific traits of the XTH gene family members and their expression pattern in different tissues and under stress have not been carried out in sweet potato. Thirty-six XTH genes were identified in I. batatas, all of which had conserved structures (Glyco_hydro_16). Based on Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic analysis the IbXTHs can be divided into three subfamilies-the I/II, IIIA, and IIIB subfamilies, which were unevenly distributed on 13 chromosomes, with the exception of Chr9 and Chr15. Multiple cis-acting regions related to growth and development, as well as stress responses, may be found in the IbXTH gene promoters. The segmental duplication occurrences greatly aided the evolution of IbXTHs. The results of a collinearity analysis showed that the XTH genes of sweet potato shared evolutionary history with three additional species, including A. thaliana, G. max, and O. sativa. Additionally, based on the transcriptome sequencing data, the results revealed that the IbXTHs have different expression patterns in leaves, stems, the root body (RB), the distal end (DE), the root stock (RS), the proximal end (PE), the initiative storage root (ISR), and the fibrous root (FR), and many of them are well expressed in the roots. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis of FRs after hormone treatment of the roots indicated that IbXTH28 and IbXTH30 are up-regulated under salicylic acid (SA) treatment but down-regulated under methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. Attentionally, there were only two genes showing down-regulation under the cold and drought treatment. Collectively, all of the findings suggested that genes from the XTH family are crucial for root specificity. This study could provide a theoretical basis for further research on the molecular function of sweet potato XTH genes.",

They are involved in the regulation of plant growth and development, hormone crosstalk, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, SWEET family genes have not been explored in the sweet potato. In this study, we identified 27, 27, and 25 SWEETs in cultivated hexaploid sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas, 2n = 6x = 90) and its two diploid relatives, Ipomoea trifida (2n = 2x = 30) and Ipomoea triloba (2n = 2x = 30), respectively. These SWEETs were divided into four subgroups according to their phylogenetic relationships with Arabidopsis. The protein physiological properties, chromosome localization, phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, promoter cis-elements, protein interaction networks, and expression patterns of these 79 SWEETs were systematically investigated. The results suggested that homologous SWEETs are differentiated in sweet potato and its two diploid relatives and play various vital roles in plant growth, tuberous root development, carotenoid accumulation, hormone crosstalk, and abiotic stress response. This work provides a comprehensive comparison and furthers our understanding of the SWEET genes in the sweet potato and its two diploid relatives, thereby supplying a theoretical foundation for their functional study and further facilitating the molecular breeding of sweet potato.",

This study investigated the effects of vanadium concentrations on sweet potato growth, biomass, root morphology, photosynthesis, photosynthetic assimilation, antioxidant defense system, stomatal traits, and V accumulation. Sweet potato plants were grown hydroponically and treated with five levels of V (0, 10, 25, 50, and 75 mg L-1). After 7 days of treatment, V content at low concentration (10 mg L-1) enhanced the plant growth and biomass; in contrast, drastic effects were observed at 25, 50, and 75 mg L-1. Higher V concentrations negatively affect the relative water content, photosynthetic assimilation, photosynthesis, and root growth and reduce tolerance indices. The stomatal traits of sweet potato, such as stomatal length, width, pore length, and pore width, were also decreased under higher V application. Furthermore, V concentration and uptake in the roots were higher than in the shoots. In the same way, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (hydrogen peroxide), lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde), osmolytes, glutathione, and enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) activities were increased significantly under V stress. In conclusion, V at a low level (10 mg L-1) enhanced sweet potato growth, and a higher level of V treatment (25, 50, and 75 mg L-1) had a deleterious impact on the growth, physiology, and biochemical mechanisms, as well as stomatal traits of sweet potato."

The results indicated that the native starch (NS) was polygonal, round, and bell-shaped with smooth surfaces. After debranching treatment, the surface of the starch samples became rough and irregular. The molecular weight became smaller after treatments. X-ray diffraction C-type pattern was transformed into a B-type structure in treated samples with increased relative crystallinity. 13C NMR indicated an increased propensity for double helix formation and new shift at C1, 3, 5 region compared to NS. The apparent amylose content was 21.53% in the NS. As the swelling power decreased, the percentage of soluble solids increased and different thermal properties were observed. A higher yield of the resistant starch (RS) was observed in all treated starch except PDA 25 h. The findings of our study reveal that a combination of pullulanase debranching time (15 h) and autoclaving (121 °C for 20 min) is a great technique that can be used to produce a higher amount of resistant starch in the Jinshu No.17 starch."

Hence, experiments were conducted in 2020 and 2021 to evaluate the sole and combined applications of biochar and K fertilizer on soil properties and performance of sweet potato. It was hypothesized that the effects of combined applications of biochar and K fertilizer on the growth, and yield of sweet potato will be more than their individual applications. The study each year consisted of a 3 × 3 factorial experiment with three levels (0, 10, and 20 t ha-1) of wood biochar and three levels (0, 70, and 120 kg ha-1) of K fertilizer (potassium chloride). The 9 treatment combinations have three replications and follow a randomized complete block design. Results revealed that biochar alone or in combination with K fertilizer improved soil physical and chemical properties, growth, and yield of sweet potato relative to the control and K fertilizer alone. The interaction of biochar and K (biochar × K fertilizer) fertilizer was significant for growth and yield parameters. The addition of K fertilizer to biochar improved the performance of sweet potato compared with sole applications of K fertilizer or biochar. 20 t ha-1 biochar +70 kg ha-1 K fertilizer and 20 t ha-1 biochar +120 kg ha-1 K fertilizer increased growth and yield relative to 10 t ha-1 biochar +70 kg ha-1 K fertilizer and 10 t ha-1 biochar +120 ha-1 kg K fertilizer. Since 20 t ha-1 biochar +120 kg ha-1 K fertilizer and 20 t ha-1 biochar +70 kg ha-1 K fertilizer were statistically similar, for this experiment, 20 t ha-1 biochar +70 kg ha-1 K fertilizer would be recommended for sweet potato production. Therefore, the addition of 70 kg K fertilizer with biochar has reduced the cost of increasing the rate to 120 kg ha-1 which would have been economical in view of the high price and lack of K fertilizer in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries."

      "abstract": "Crop productivity is enormously exposed to different environmental stresses, among which chromium (Cr) stress raises considerable concerns and causes a serious threat to plant growth. This study explored the toxic effect of Cr on sweet potato plants. Plants were hydroponically grown, and treatments of 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µM Cr were applied for seven days. This study exhibited that a low level of Cr treatment (25 µM) enhanced the growth, biomass, photosynthesis, osmolytes, antioxidants, and enzyme activities. However, significant deleterious effects in growth, biomass, photosynthetic attributes, antioxidants, and enzymes were observed at higher levels of Cr treatment. The remarkable reduction in plant growth traits was associated with the over-accumulation of H2O2 and MDA contents (410% and 577%, respectively) under the highest rate of Cr (200 µM). Under 200 µM Cr, the uptake in the roots were 27.4 mg kg-1 DW, while in shoots were 11 mg kg-1 DW with the highest translocation rate from root to shoot was 0.40. The results showed that the higher accumulation of Cr negatively correlated with the phenotypic and physiological parameters. It may be proposed that Cr toxicity causes oxidative damage as sustained by augmented lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, and reduced photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll, and stomatal traits. The chloroplastic ultrastructure was damaged, and more apparent damage and size reduction were observed at higher Cr levels. Furthermore, aggregated Cr concentration positively correlates with the increase of osmolytes and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the leaves of sweet potato. Moreover, improved osmolytes and SOD do not help protect sweet potato against high Cr stress. Overall, these findings will improve the understanding of the defense mechanisms of sweet potato to Cr stress.",

The smaller the particle size, the more serious the aggregation. Therefore, we tried to treat SNPs with dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma before freeze drying. Properties including morphological features, crystalline structure and apparent viscosity of various starches were measured by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and rheometer, respectively. The results showed that, after cold plasma (CP) treatment, the aggregation of SNPs during freeze drying was significantly inhibited. Compared to the native sweet potato starch, SNPs showed a higher relative crystallinity and a lower apparent viscosity. After CP treatment, the relative crystallinity of CP SNPs was further higher, and the apparent viscosity was lower. This work provides new ideas for the preparation of SNPs and could promote the development of sweet potato SNPs in the field of active ingredient delivery."

      "abstract": "Novel selective enzymatic refining of sweet potato processing residues requires judicious enzyme selection and enzyme discovery. We prepared a pectinaceous cell wall polysaccharide fraction from sweet potato using an enzymatic a treatment to preserve the natural linkages and substitutions. Polysaccharide composition and linkage analysis data confirmed the pectinaceous polysaccharide fraction to be a rhamnogalacturonan I-rich fraction with a high content of arabinogalactan Type I. We hypothesized that the post-harvest tuber pathogenic fungus Penicillium sclerotigenum would harbor novel enzymes targeting selective sweet potato pectin modification. As part of the study, we also report the first genome sequence of P. sclerotigenum. We incubated the sweet potato pectinaceous fraction with P. sclerotigenum. Using proteomics accompanied by CUPP-bioinformatics analysis, we observed induced expression of 23 pectin-associated degradative enzymes. We also identified six abundantly secreted, induced proteins that do not correspond to known CAZymes, but which we suggest as novel enzymes involved in pectin degradation. For validation, the predicted CUPP grouping of putative CAZymes and the exo-proteome data obtained for P. sclerotigenum during growth on sweet potato pectin were compared with proteomics and transcriptomics data reported previously for pectin-associated CAZymes from Aspergillus niger strain NRRL3. The data infer that P. sclerotigenum has the capacity to express several novel enzymes that may provide novel opportunities for sweet potato pectin modification and valorization of sweet potato starch processing residues. In addition, the methodological approach employed represents an integrative systematic strategy for enzyme discovery."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Purple sweet potato Ipomoea batatas (L.) has long been used as a medicine and a food. It contains various bioactive substances such as polysaccharides, anthocyanins, and flavonoids. Purple sweet potato polysaccharides are known to have anti-oxidant, anti-tumor, and immunomodulatory functions. Nevertheless, studies on the structural characterization of purple sweet potato polysaccharides and their ability to prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have rarely been reported. RESULTS: A novel polysaccharide (PSPP-A) was extracted and isolated from purple sweet potato, and its structural characteristics and preventive effects on NAFLD were investigated. The results indicated that PSPP-A was composed of l-rhamnose, d-arabinose, d-galactose, d-glucose, and d-glucuronic acid with molar ratios of 1.89:8.45:1.95:1.13:1. Its molecular weight was 2.63 × 103  kDa. Methylation and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis indicated that the glycosidic linkages were →3)-α-L-Araf-(1→, α-L-Araf-(1→, →2,4)-α-L-Rhap-(1→, 4-O-Me-β-D-GlcAp-(1→, →4)-α-D-Glcp-(1→, →4)-β-D-Galp-(1→, and →6)-β-D-Galp-(1→. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the structure of PSPP-A was irregular. Subsequently, the protective effect of PSPP-A on NAFLD was investigated. The results indicated that bodyweight, liver index, and triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) content were significantly reduced by intervention of purple sweet potato polysaccharide-A (PSPP-A) compared with the - high-fat diet group. Liver histopathological analysis indicated that PSPP-A attenuated irregular hepatocyte patterns and excessive lipid vacuoles. CONCLUSIONS: The novel polysaccharide, PSPP-A, mainly contains arabinose, which has certain preventive effects on NAFLD. This study provides a theoretical basis for further elucidating the hepatoprotective effect of purple sweet potatoes as a functional food. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Drought limits crop development and yields. bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factors play critical roles in regulating the drought response in many plants, but their roles in this process in sweet potato are unknown. Here, we report that two bHLH proteins, IbbHLH118 and IbbHLH66, play opposite roles in the ABA-mediated drought response in sweet potato. ABA treatment repressed IbbHLH118 expression but induced IbbHLH66 expression in the drought-tolerant sweet potato line Xushu55-2. Overexpressing IbbHLH118 reduced drought tolerance, whereas overexpressing IbbHLH66 enhanced drought tolerance, in sweet potato. IbbHLH118 directly binds to the E-boxes in the promoters of ABA-insensitive 5 (IbABI5), ABA-responsive element binding factor 2 (IbABF2) and tonoplast intrinsic protein 1 (IbTIP1) to suppress their transcription. IbbHLH118 forms homodimers with itself or heterodimers with IbbHLH66. Both of the IbbHLHs interact with the ABA receptor IbPYL8. ABA accumulates under drought stress, promoting the formation of the IbPYL8-IbbHLH66-IbbHLH118 complex. This complex interferes with IbbHLH118's repression of ABA-responsive genes, thereby activating ABA responses and enhancing drought tolerance. These findings shed light on the role of the IbPYL8-IbbHLH66-IbbHLH118 complex in the ABA-dependent drought response of sweet potato and identify candidate genes for developing elite crop varieties with enhanced drought tolerance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As one of three essential nutrients, potassium is regarded as a main limiting factor for growth and development in plant. Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is one of seven major food crops grown worldwide, and is both a nutrient-rich food and a bioenergy crop. It is a typical 'K-favoring' crop, and the level of potassium ion (K+) supplementation directly influences its production. However, little is known about the transcriptional changes in sweet potato genes under low-K+ conditions. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of sweet potato roots in response to K+ deficiency to determine the effect of low-K+ stress on this economically important crop. RESULTS: The roots of sweet potato seedlings with or without K+ treatment were harvested and used for transcriptome analyses. The results showed 559 differently expressed genes (DEGs) in low and high K+ groups. Among the DEGs, 336 were upregulated and 223 were downregulated. These DEGs were involved in transcriptional regulation, calcium binding, redox-signaling, biosynthesis, transport, and metabolic process. Further analysis revealed previously unknow genes involved in low-K+ stress, which could be investigated further to improve low K+ tolerance in plants. Confirmation of RNA-sequencing results using qRT-PCR displayed a high level of consistency between the two experiments. Analysis showed that many auxin-, ethylene- and jasmonic acid-related genes respond to K+ deficiency, suggesting that these hormones have important roles in K+ nutrient signaling in sweet potato. CONCLUSIONS: According to the transcriptome data of sweet potato, various DEGs showed transcriptional changes in response to low-K+ stress. However, the expression level of some kinases, transporters, transcription factors (TFs), hormone-related genes, and plant defense-related genes changed significantly, suggesting that they have important roles during K+ deficiency. Thus, this study identifies potential genes for genetic improvement of responses to low-K+ stress and provides valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating low K+ tolerance in sweet potato. Further research is required to clarify the function of these DEGs under low-K+ stress.",

Owing to highly aggressive invasiveness and metastatic properties, the prognosis of this disease remains poor even with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Rutin is a glycoside natural flavonoid that modulates microglia inflammatory profile and improves anti-glioma activity. Here, a glycoside flavonoid was extracted and named purple sweet potato delphinidin-3-rutin (PSPD3R). In an experiment using the subcutaneous xenograft model of human glioblastoma (GBM) and alamar blue assay, we found that PSPD3R suppressed the glioma proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometry assay and transmission electron microscopy observation revealed that PSPD3R stimulated glioma cell autophagy and apoptosis. High-throughput microRNA (miRNA) sequencing showed that PSPD3R substantially affected the miRNA expression of U251 cells. Acridine orange staining and immunoblotting indicated that PSPD3R regulated autophagy via Akt/Creb/miR-20b-5p in glioma cells. Luciferase reporter assays showed that autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) mRNA was the target gene of miR-20b-5p. The downregulation of miR-20b-5p inhibited glioma proliferation in vivo. In summary, PSPD3R regulated autophagy in glioma via the Akt/Creb/miR-20b-5p/Atg7 axis. This work unraveled the molecular mechanism of PSPD3R-induced autophagy in glioma and revealed its potential as a therapeutic agent for glioma treatment."

Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) degrades carotenoids to produce apocarotenoids, which are involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. This study shows that the expression of sweet potato IbCCD4 was significantly induced by salt and dehydration stress. The heterologous expression of IbCCD4 in Arabidopsis was induced to confirm its salt tolerance. Under 200 mM NaCl treatment, compared to wild-type plants, the rosette leaves of IbCCD4-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed increased anthocyanins and carotenoid contents, an increased expression of most genes in the carotenoid metabolic pathway, and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. IbCCD4-overexpressing lines also showed a decreased expression of resistance-related genes and a lower activity of three antioxidant enzymes: peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). These results indicate that IbCCD4 reduced salt tolerance in Arabidopsis, which contributes to the understanding of the role of IbCCD4 in salt stress.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the results of batch anaerobic digestion (AD) of thermochemically pre-treated sweet potato root waste (SPW). This agricultural waste is available in massive quantities yet it has remained an unexploited resource amid the ever-increasing need for clean energy and waste disposal challenges. Therefore, the waste can be considered for energy production through AD. However, SPW has a complex amylopectin structure that is resistant to digestive enzymes during hydrolysis which could lead to a longer retention time in the digester. In this sense, the effect of thermochemical pre-treatment on biogas production from SPW was investigated by pre-treating the substrate with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at (0.6 g/L-3.5 g/L), temperature (50 °C-90 °C) and pretreatment time (30-120 min). The central composite design was used to design the number of experiments. SPW was milled to a small size. The physicochemical characteristics of materials were determined using standard methods. The quality of biogas produced in terms of methane content was analysed. The results from the study revealed that thermochemical pre-treatment on SPW improved biogas and methane yields. The pre-treated SPW had superior results to the untreated one. It represented a 33.88% improvement from 28.23 mL/gSPW biogas yield for the untreated SPW to 37.8 mL/gSPW for the treated SPW at optimal conditions. The optimum conditions for biogas production were found at a NaOH concentration of 2.9 g/L, a heating temperature of 82 °C, and a pre-treatment time of 102 min. Methane content in the biogas also improved from 42% to 64% (22% increase). The digester retention time was also reduced from 22 to 16 days. It can therefore be concluded that thermochemical pre-treatment of SPW improves both biogas yield and methane content as well as improves the kinetics of AD."

      "abstract": "The MYB (v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) transcription factor family plays an important role in plant growth, development, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the gene functions of MYB transcription factors in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) have not been elucidated. In this study, an MYB transcription factor gene, IbMYB308, was identified and isolated from sweet potato. Multiple sequence alignment showed that IbMYB308 is a typical R2R3-MYB transcription factor. Further, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that IbMYB308 was expressed in root, stem, and, especially, leaf tissues. Moreover, it showed that IbMYB308 had a tissue-specific profile. The experiment also showed that the expression of IbMYB308 was induced by different abiotic stresses (20% PEG-6000, 200 mM NaCl, and 20% H2O2). After a 200 mM NaCl treatment, the expression of several stress-related genes (SOD, POD, APX, and P5CS) was upregulation in transgenic plants, and the CAT activity, POD activity, proline content, and protein content in transgenic tobacco had increased, while MDA content had decreased. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that IbMYB308 could improve salt stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco. These findings lay a foundation for future studies on the R2R3-MYB gene family of sweet potato and suggest that IbMYB308 could potentially be used as an important positive factor in transgenic plant breeding to improve salt stress tolerance in sweet potato plants.",

      "abstract": "The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) is an important and widely grown crop, and the nitrogenase reductase (nifH) gene is the most widely sequenced marker gene used to identify nitrogen-fixing bacteria and archaea. There have been many examples of the isolation of the diazotrophic endophytes in sweet potatoes, and there has been no report on whether sweet potatoes and their wild ancestors harbored nifH genes. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of nifH genes has been conducted on these species by using bioinformatics and molecular biology methods. A total of 20, 19 and 17 nifH genes were identified for the first time in sweet potatoes, I. trifida and I. triloba, respectively. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, all of the nifH genes, except for g10233.t1, itf14g14040.t1 and itb14g15470.t1, were clustered into five independent clades: I, II, III, IV and V. The nifH genes clustered in the same phylogenetic branch showed a more similar distribution of conserved motifs and exons-introns than those of the other ones. All of the identified genes were further mapped on the 15 chromosomes of the sweet potato, I. trifida and I. triloba. No segmental duplication was detected in each genome of three Ipomoea species, and 0, 8 and 7 tandemly duplicated gene pairs were detected in the genome of the sweet potato, I. trifida and I. triloba, respectively. Synteny analysis between the three Ipomoea species revealed that there were 7, 7 and 8 syntenic gene pairs of nifH genes detected between the sweet potato and I. trifida, between the sweet potato and I. triloba and between I. trifida and I. triloba, respectively. All of the duplicated and syntenic nifH genes were subjected to purifying selection inside duplicated genomic elements during speciation, except for the tandemly duplicated gene pair itf11g07340.t2_itf11g07340.t3, which was subjected to positive selection. Different expression profiles were detected in the sweet potato, I. trifida and I. triloba. According to the above results, four nifH genes of the sweet potato (g950, g16683, g27094 and g33987) were selected for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis in two sweet potato cultivars (Eshu 15 and Long 9) under nitrogen deficiency (N0) and normal (N1) conditions. All of them were upregulated in the N1 treatment and were consistent with the analysis of the RNA-seq data. We hope that these results will provide new insights into the nifH genes in the sweet potato and its wild ancestors and will contribute to the molecular breeding of sweet potatoes in the future.",

Severe complications of CG include neurological impairments, growth restriction, cognitive delays, and, for most females, primary ovarian insufficiency. The absence of the GALT enzyme leads to an accumulation of aberrant galactose metabolites, which are assumed to be responsible for the sequelae. There is no treatment besides the restriction of dietary galactose, which does not halt the development of the complications; thus, additional treatments are sorely needed. Supplements have been used in other inborn errors of metabolism but are not part of the therapeutic regimen for CG. The goal of this study was to test two generally recognized as safe supplements (purple sweet potato color (PSPC) and myo-inositol (MI)) that may impact cellular pathways contributing to the complications in CG. Our group uses a GalT gene-trapped mouse model to study the pathophysiology in CG, which phenocopy many of the complications.

      "abstract": "The sweet potato is very sensitive to low temperature. Our previous study revealed that IbMPK3-overexpressing transgenic sweet potato (M3) plants showed stronger low-temperature stress tolerance than wild-type plants (WT). However, the mechanism of M3 plants in response to low-temperature stress is unclear. To further analyze how IbMPK3 mediates low-temperature stress in sweet potato, WT and M3 plants were exposed to low-temperature stress for 2 h and 12 h for RNA-seq analysis, whereas normal conditions were used as a control (CK). In total, 3436 and 8718 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in WT at 2 h (vs. CK) and 12 h (vs. CK) under low-temperature stress, respectively, whereas 1450 and 9291 DEGs were detected in M3 plants, respectively. Many common and unique DEGs were analyzed in WT and M3 plants. DEGs related to low temperature were involved in Ca2+ signaling, MAPK cascades, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway, hormone transduction pathway, encoding transcription factor families (bHLH, NAC, and WRKY), and downstream stress-related genes. Additionally, more upregulated genes were associated with the MAPK pathway in M3 plants during short-term low-temperature stress (CK vs. 2 h), and more upregulated genes were involved in secondary metabolic synthesis in M3 plants than in the WT during the long-time low-temperature stress treatment (CK vs. 12 h), such as fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation, glutathione metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, and zeatin biosynthesis. Moreover, the interaction proteins of IbMPK3 related to photosynthesis, or encoding CaM, NAC, and ribosomal proteins, were identified using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H). This study may provide a valuable resource for elucidating the sweet potato low-temperature stress resistance mechanism, as well as data to support molecular-assisted breeding with the IbMPK3 gene.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the selenium tolerance of different sweet potato [Dioscorea esculenta (Lour.) Burkill] is essential for simultaneously for breeding of new selenium-tolerant varieties and improving the selenium content in sweet potato. Therefore, a greenhouse experiment was conducted from February to April 2022 to evaluate the effect of sweet potato cultivars and selenium (Na2SeO3) concentrations (0-40 mg/L) on plant growth, physiological activities and plant selenium content distribution. The results showed that when the selenium concentration was more than 3 mg/L, the plant growth was significantly affected and the plant height and root length were significantly different compared to the control. While the selenium concentration was 20 and 40 mg/L had the greatest effect on plant growth when the number of internodes and leaves of the plant decreased, the root system stopped growing and the number of internodes of the plant, the number of leaves and the dry-to-fresh weight ratio of the plant a very significant level compared to reached control. The relative amount of chlorophyll in leaves under treatment with a selenium concentration of 1 mg/L was increased, and the relative amount of chlorophyll in 3 mg/L leaves gradually increased with the increase in the selenium concentration. The values of the maximum photochemical efficiency PSII (fv/fm) and the potential activity of PSII (fv/fo) compared to the control under treatment with 40 mg/L selenium concentration and photosynthesis of plants was inhibited. The selenium content in root, stem and leaf increased with the increase in selenium concentration, and the distribution of selenium content in the plant was leaf <stem <root, and the selenium content in root was significantly higher than that in stem and leaf. In summary, the appropriate concentration of selenium tolerance has been determined to be 3 mg/L. The aquatic culture identification method of selenium tolerance of sweet potatoes and growth indices of various selenium tolerant varieties (lines) established in this study will provide a technical basis for selenium tolerant cultivation and mechanism research."

      "abstract": "Sweet potato leaves (SPL) are a valuable source of phytonutrients with nutritional and various health-promoting benefits. This study evaluated the effects of green and purple SPL supplementation on hepatic xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XME) and membrane transporters, and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) metabolism and B[a]P accumulation in rats. The experiments were conducted in standard and B[a]P-treated rat models. The first experiment showed that rats fed a diet containing 5% (w/w) green or purple SPL for two weeks showed increased hepatic activity of cytochrome P-450 (CYP)1A1/1A2 and glutathione S-transferase. Green SPL supplementation also increased the CYP2C, CYP2D and CYP3A and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 levels in the liver. Notably, green and purple SPL induced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 protein expression and reduced oxidative stress in the liver. The second experiment was to evaluate the effects of green and purple SPL supplementation on B[a]P metabolism and B[a]P accumulation in rats. Rats were fed SPL diets (the same as experiment I) for two weeks. When rats were exposed to a single dose (25 mg per kg BW) of B[a]P, green SPL had no effect on B[a]P-induced elevation of CYP1A1 activity but induced GST activity in the intestinal mucosa and the liver. Green SPL also increased hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity and reduced B[a]P levels in the plasma, liver, and intestinal mucosa. A lower plasma 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine level was found after B[a]P treatment only in the green SPL group. This study suggests that, in the standard rat model, green and purple SPL may increase Nrf2-mediated antioxidant activity and facilitate the xenobiotic detoxification process by increasing hepatic XME and transporters. When exposed to B[a]P, however, only green SPL consumption may increase hepatic B[a]P metabolism and lower the B[a]P level in the liver by increasing phase II detoxifying enzyme activities.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. The mechanism of oxidative stress in AD is due to amyloid beta (Aβ) protein that aggregates to form plaques, which further triggers chronic inflammation and neuronal apoptosis. Purple sweet potato extract with the main content of anthocyanins is a potential antioxidant with a direct target on the amyloid cascade hypothesis. OBJECTIVE: The research objective was to determine the role of purple sweet potato water extract as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory in preventing apoptosis in order to provide a neuroprotective effect in d-galactose-induced rats. METHODS: A total of 100 male Wistar rats with randomized posttest-only control group design that met the eligibility criteria were included in this study. The treatment group was given 200 mg/kg BW/day of purple sweet potato water extract on days 1-70. d-galactose induction was administered in the treatment and control groups on days 15-70. RESULTS: The independent t-test showed that the mean tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in the treatment group (735.36±139.74) was significantly lower than that in the control group (896.77±152.52). The p53 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expressions of astrocyte cells in the treatment group were significantly lower than that in the control group. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the treatment group (498.13±121.47) were higher than that in the control (391.93±140.28), and there was a significant increase in spatial working memory in the treatment group (72.01±10.22) than the control (59.77±11.87). CONCLUSIONS: The neuroprotective effect of purple sweet potato extract is due to d-galactose induction resulting from decrease in TNF-α levels, p53 expression, and GFAP expression and increase in BDNF levels and spatial working memory."

Root tuber of Simon 1 (SIMON), a cultivar of sweet potato, is a folk food in China with a hemostasis function but lacking experimental data support. METHODS AND RESULTS: Now the protective effect of SIMON on chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT), a serious complication of cancer treatment, is investigated for the first time by a CIT mouse model induced by intraperitoneal injection of carboplatin. As a result, SIMON raises the number of peripheral platelets, white blood cells, and bone marrow nucleated cells in CIT mice significantly. Besides, carboplatin-induced atrophy of the thymus, spleen, and disordered metabolism of the inflammatory immune system and glycerophospholipids are also reversed by SIMON. Phytochemical analysis of SIMON indicates 16 compounds including eight phenolic derivatives, which might be associated with its anti-CIT bioactivity. CONCLUSION: Sweet potato (SIMON) may be an efficient function food in the prevention of bleeding disorders.",

      "abstract": "Flooding is harmful to almost all higher plants, including crop species. Most cultivars of the root crop sweet potato are able to tolerate environmental stresses such as drought, high temperature, and high salinity. They are, however, relatively sensitive to flooding stress, which greatly reduces yield and commercial value. Previous transcriptomic analysis of flood-sensitive and flood-resistant sweet potato cultivars identified genes that were likely to contribute to protection against flooding stress, including genes related to ethylene (ET), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. Although each sweet potato cultivar can be classified as either tolerant or sensitive to flooding stress, the molecular mechanisms of flooding resistance in ET, ROS, and NO regulation-mediated responses have not yet been reported. Therefore, this study characterized the regulation of ET, ROS, and NO metabolism in two sweet potato cultivars-one flood-tolerant cultivar and one flood-sensitive cultivar-under early flooding treatment conditions. The expression of ERFVII genes, which are involved in low oxygen signaling, was upregulated in leaves during flooding stress treatments. In addition, levels of respiratory burst oxidase homologs and metallothionein-mediated ROS scavenging were greatly increased in the early stage of flooding in the flood-tolerant sweet potato cultivar compared with the flood-sensitive cultivar. The expression of genes involved in NO biosynthesis and scavenging was also upregulated in the tolerant cultivar. Finally, NO scavenging-related MDHAR expressions and enzymatic activity were higher in the flood-tolerant cultivar than in the flood-sensitive cultivar. These results indicate that, in sweet potato, genes involved in ET, ROS, and NO regulation play an important part in response mechanisms against flooding stress."

The results showed that the swelling power, lightness (L⁎) and whiteness index (WI), gelatinization enthalpy of starch decreased by MA and MLA treatment. The starch treated by MLA showed a new characteristic absorption peak at near 1735 cm-1 in the measurement of FT-IR, while the starch treated with MA showed no new characteristic peak. The relative crystallinity of starch modified by MSE and MA decreased, but it still retained A-type crystal structure. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the surface destruction of MSE-modified starch was greater than that of starch modified by MA. MLA increased the content of resistant starch (RS), while MA reduced the content of resistant starch (RS). The relative crystallinity and gelatinization enthalpy of continuous 60 s treatment were lower than those of discontinuous 60 s treatment. These results indicated that MLA had a greater effect on the physicochemical properties, structural and digestibility of starch than MA. Starch modified by MLA can be added to foods as a low-carbohydrate ingredient, and the starch treated by MA is suitable for foods with low swelling, such as noodles.",

Males of West Indian sweet potato weevil Euscepes postfasciatus deliver a remating inhibitor along with sperm to their mates during mating, leading to a refractory period (the period before females mate again). Crossing experiments were conducted using lines reared on artificial diets, including sweet potato powder (AD) or sweet potato tubers (SP) during the larval stage, and the refractory period was examined. We also examined whether the larval diet qualitatively or quantitatively altered male ejaculate. The results showed that the refractory period was significantly longer in the SP treatment than in the AD treatment for males and females. There was no significant difference in ejaculate volume. However, the number of sperm in the testes-seminal vesicles complex was significantly higher in the SP treatment. Additionally, SDS-PAGE revealed that the ejaculate was qualitatively different depending on the larval diet, and one protein of approximately 15 kDa in size was expressed only in the SP treatments. Revealing how larval diet affects reproductive traits in adult males will help shed light on the diverse evolution of insect mating systems and reproductive behavior."

The normal chow diet (NCD) group, high-fat/cholesterol diet (HCD) group, and three groups based on HCD and added with low, middle, and high dose of PSPAE (PAL, PAM, and PAH) were raised for 12 weeks. High dose of PSPAE treatment decreased the elevations of the body weight by 24.7%, serum total cholesterol by 48.3%, serum triglyceride by 42.4%, and elevated serum activities of glutathione peroxidase by 53.3%, superoxide dismutase by 57.8%, catalase by 75.4%, decreased serum contents of malondialdehyde by 27.1% and lipopolysaccharides by 40.5%, as well as increased caecal total short-chain fatty acid by 2.05-fold. Additionally, PSPAE depressed toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor α, and preserved nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) gene expression. Similarly, the protein expression of Nrf2 was enhanced, while TLR-4 and p-NF-κB/NF-κB were depressed by PSPAE treatment. Moreover, PSPAE administration promoted the protection of intestinal barrier function and rebuilt gut microbiota homeostasis by blooming g_Akkermansia, g_Bifidobacterium, and g_Lactobacillus. Furthermore, antibiotic interference experiments showed that the gut microbiota was indispensable for preserving the redox state of PSPAE. These results suggested that PSPAE administration could be an opportunity for improving HCD-induced obesity and the redox state related to gut dysbiosis. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Purple sweet potato anthocyanin has diverse pharmacological properties. It is applicable for individuals to consume extracts (as pills or other forms) from raw purple sweet potato if they want to improve obesity or redox state.",

The protein physiological property, chromosome localization, phylogenetic relationship, gene structure, promoter cis-acting regulatory elements, and protein interaction network were systematically investigated to explore the possible roles of homologous CDPKs in the growth and development and abiotic stress responses of sweet potato. The expression profiles of the identified CDPKs in different tissues and treatments revealed tissue specificity and various expression patterns in sweet potato and its two diploid relatives, supporting the difference in the evolutionary trajectories of hexaploid sweet potato.

      "abstract": "The drying of agricultural produce is an important food preservation measure. However, high energy requirements for drying, limited access to energy sources, small-medium scale farmers experience high post-harvest losses of their produce. Therefore, there is a need to develop and optimize low-cost food preservation technologies. In this study, eleven mathematical models were used to estimate the drying coefficients following non-linear regression method, in hot-air oven and naturally-ventilated solar-venturi drying to find the best fit of the moisture ration models. Sweet potato tubers were sliced at 3, 5 and 7 mm thickness sizes with and without pre-drying treatments. The prepared sweet potato slices were dried in a hot-air oven dryer at a constant temperature of 70 °C in comparison to the naturally-ventilated solar-venturi dryer with a heated ambient air that varied according to the outside environmental conditions. The drying rate of the samples in a hot-air oven dryer was higher than for those in the naturally-ventilated solar-venturi dryer. The results showed that the drying time was significantly (P < 0.05) affected by the thickness size of sweet potato slices (SPS) and that the drying took place at the falling rate period and a constant drying time. The Midilli et al. model was the best fit for predicting the moisture ratio of SPS dried in hot-air oven dryer and naturally-ventilated solar-venturi dryer based on statistical analysis (R2 = 0.982-0.999, χ2 = 4.60 × 10-6-5.56 × 10-5 and RMSE = 0.011-0.067).
