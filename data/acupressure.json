      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Non-pharmacological interventions for restless legs syndrome (RLS) are frequently used, although scientific evidence remains limited. The study aimed to investigate the feasibility and effects of self-applied hydrotherapy and self-applied acupressure in patients with RLS. METHODS: In a three-armed randomized single-center open exploratory pilot study, adults with moderate to severe RLS were randomly allocated to 6 weeks of daily hydrotherapy plus routine care (HT group), acupressure plus routine care (AP group), or routine care alone (RC group). Outcome measures included RLS symptom severity (IRLS), disease-specific quality of life (RLSQoL), the impression of change (PGI-C), health-related quality of life (SF-12), psychological outcomes (SGW-B, HADS, and GSE), and adherence and adverse events (AEs) after 6 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-four adults (mean age 57.5 ± 11.4 years, 63% women) were included. The study showed good feasibility with an 83% retention rate. After 6 weeks, baseline-adjusted mean IRLS scores were 19.8 (95% [16.4, 23.2]) for HT, 22.9 (19.2, 26.6) for AP, and 24.0 (20.8, 27.2) for RC. RLSQoL adjusted means were 65.3 (59.7, 70.9) for HT, 68.3 (62.3, 74.3) for AP, and 56.2 (50.9, 61.5) for RC, after 6 weeks. Both interventions were safe, with high adherence rates. CONCLUSION: Self-applied hydrotherapy and acupressure appear to be feasible and safe interventions for patients with RLS. This exploratory pilot study suggests potential benefits, though larger, well-designed confirmatory studies are needed to validate these findings. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (number DRKS00029960) on August 09, 2022. https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00029960."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the difference in pain intensity before and after acupressure at Sanyinjiao Point 6 (SP6) in medical students with Primary Dysmenorrhea (PD). METHODS: The research design was quasi-experimental adopting a single group comparing pre and post-intervention data. The study was conducted in a private medical institute in Karachi, Pakistan, from September 2022 to April 2023. To select participants, a modified menstrual symptom questionnaire was used, and to measure the pain, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used during the four months of the study. A convenient sample of 50 healthy medical students were included who suffered from PD and were not using analgesics. After taking informed written consent, in the first month, VAS scoring was done without intervention on the first three days of the menstrual cycle (MC). In the subsequent three MCs, acupressure was self-applied (after being taught by a qualified acupressurist) three times a day at acupoint SP6 for two to five minutes on both legs one by one during the first three days of each intervention MC and VAS pain scoring was done. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in pain intensity (p<0.01) was observed in post-acupressure VAS scores during the first three days of each intervention menstrual cycle. CONCLUSION: Acupressure at the SP6 point has been shown to effectively reduce pain intensity in medical students with primary dysmenorrhea. As a result, this alternative therapy can be recommended as a non-pharmacological option for pain management."

      "abstract": "AIMS: To examine the effectiveness of acupressure on sleep quality in cancer patients and to identify the population-level and intervention-level characteristics associated with the intervention outcome of sleep quality. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, APA PsycInfo, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang were searched for eligible randomised controlled trials from inception to April 2024. METHODS: Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomised Trials 2.0. A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses and the meta-regression aimed to investigate potential heterogeneity and identify characteristics that may be associated with more favourable acupressure outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 22 randomised controlled trials involving 2113 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with various control groups, acupressure exhibited a significant beneficial effect on sleep quality in cancer patients at post-intervention (SMD = -1.38, 95% CI [-1.81, -0.95], p < 0.001) and at 4-week follow-up (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI [-0.56, -0.10], p = 0.004). Acupressure also showed statistically significant improvements in sleep efficiency (SMD = 0.77, 95% CI [0.27, 1.26], p = 0.002) and total sleep time (SMD = 0.68, 95% CI [0.15, 1.22], p = 0.010) at post-intervention. None of the characteristics significantly affected the overall effect size on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure appears to be a promising intervention for enhancing sleep quality among cancer patients. Future studies should elucidate the long-term effects of acupressure on sleep quality, identify effective acupressure characteristics and determine which types of cancer patients benefit from this intervention. IMPACT: This study provides a comprehensive summary of evidence supporting the use of acupressure to enhance sleep quality in cancer patients and demonstrates its effectiveness in clinical nursing practice.

      "abstract": "Background: The increasing prevalence of kinesiophobia, or the fear of movement, among patients following meniscectomy has necessitated the exploration of effective rehabilitative interventions. Traditional methods of rehabilitation often do not adequately address the psychological components of recovery, leading to prolonged recovery times and decreased quality of life. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the effectiveness of psychological and traditional Chinese medical techniques, including progressive muscle relaxation training (PMRT) and acupressure, in treating kinesiophobia among patients after meniscus surgery. Methods: This randomized clinical trial commenced in December 2021 at the Sports Medicine Department of a hospital in Gansu Province and concluded in February 2023. Seventy hospital inpatients with movement disorders who had undergone meniscus shaping surgery participated in the study (experimental Group 35 people, control Group 35 people). The control group received standard care. In addition to receiving routine care, the experimental group underwent an additional 30 min of PMRT and 5-10 min of acupressure. The kinesiophobia scores and pain scores were assessed using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before the intervention, the first day after the intervention, the fifth day after the intervention, and on the day of discharge. On the day of discharge, the Knee Society Score (KSS) was used to assess the knee joint function of the patients. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The study included 70 kinesiophobia patients following meniscoplasty, equally split between the experimental and control groups. Attrition resulted in 3 experimental group withdrawals and 2 from the control group, leaving 65 for the final analysis (32 experimental, 33 control). The average age of the patients was (67.03 ± 8.26) years, with an average BMI of (25.09 ± 2.88) kg/cm2. Females accounted for 66.10% of the participants. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of their preintervention TSK scores, VAS scores, and other baseline data (p > 0.05).There were no statistically significant differences in the kinesiophobia scores (TSK scores) and pain scores (VAS scores) between the experimental group and the routine care group both before the intervention and on the first day after the intervention (p > 0.05). However, the fifth-day and discharge assessments revealed significant score improvements in the experimental group (p < 0.05), along with KSS scores indicating enhanced knee joint function compared to controls (p < 0.05). Conclusions: PMRT combined with acupressure effectively decreases kinesiophobia levels post-meniscoplasty, mitigates pain, fosters early functional exercise participation, and promotes knee joint function recovery.

This study explores the feasibility and effects of acupressure on smoking cessation in young smokers with nicotine dependence to inform policy and decision-making. METHODS: This was a single-group study with a pre/posttest design. The participants received four weeks of auricular acupressure treatment, led by a registered acupuncturist. Smoking cravings, nicotine dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and number of cigarettes per day (CPD) were recorded before and after treatment. Changes in outcomes were analyzed at 2 weeks and 4 weeks using SPSS software version 22.0. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants to explore their experiences and attitudes toward auricular acupressure. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 20 participants completed this study. A significant reduction was observed in smoking cravings (F = 11.02, P < 0.05), nicotine dependence (F = 11.09, P < 0.05), withdrawal symptoms (F = 11.19, P < 0.05), and CPD (F = 19.03, P < 0.05) across sessions. Additionally, withdrawal symptoms decreased significantly from 2 weeks to 4 weeks (P < 0.05) of acupressure treatment. Three interrelated themes emerged from the interviews: personal and external resources, the psychological and physical effects of acupressure, and satisfaction with acupressure for smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative and qualitative data suggest that acupressure maybe effectively decrease nicotine dependence and smoking cravings. However, this was a pilot and single-arm study, and these findings must be further verified. The study supports the feasibility and safety of introducing acupressure therapy for smoking cessation in young smokers."

Therefore, designing intervention measures to alleviate symptoms is crucial. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the effectiveness of a 4-week auricular acupressure intervention for reducing fatigue and improving quality of life, sleep quality, and physical activity in patients receiving chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at a medical center in northern Taiwan. The study participants comprised 80 patients undergoing chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. The experimental group received auricular acupressure therapy for 4 weeks, which targeted the shenmen (TF4), sympathetic (AH6), liver (CO12), spleen (CO13), and subcortex (AT4) acupoints, and the control group received routine care. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Group Core Questionnaire-C30, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Group Core Questionnaire-PAN26, Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwanese version, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 3-day Physical Activity Record were used for assessment. RESULTS: After auricular acupressure therapy for 4 weeks, the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in insomnia symptoms during weeks 1 to 4, as measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Group Core Questionnaire-C30 (all P < .01), and improvements in sleep quality by week 4, as measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( P < .036). CONCLUSIONS: After auricular acupressure therapy for 4 weeks, significant improvements were observed in patients' sleep quality and quality of life in terms of insomnia. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Auricular acupressure can improve sleep quality and other aspects of quality of life among patients undergoing chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. The study findings indicate the potential of auricular acupressure as an adjunctive cancer care treatment."

METHODS: Participants, ≥ 60 years with cLBP, were randomized (1:1:1) to APA with ear points targeted to cLBP (T-APA, n = 92), points non-targeted to cLBP (NT-APA, n = 91), or waitlist education control (n = 89), and followed up to 6 months (6M). Participants in the APA groups received 4 weekly APA sessions; the education control group received 4 weekly educational sessions. Primary outcomes were pain and function. RESULTS: There were 272 participants (174 women [64%]; mean [SD] age 70.0 [6.95] years; 62% non-White). Compared to control, the T-APA group had significant improvement on pain from baseline to post-intervention and one-month (1M) follow-up by 1.73 and 1.26 points (p ≤ 0.001) respectively. The NT-APA group achieved similar improvements in pain. The improvement in function by T-APA and NT-APA was significant at post-intervention by 1.89 and 2.68 points (p = 0.04 and 0.004) respectively, minimal at 1M follow-up, but significant at 6M in both APA groups. There were no statistically significant differences in treatment responses between the APA groups. Both APA groups had higher responder rates in pain and function at post-intervention and 1M follow-up compared to the control group (odds ratio ranged from 2.11 to 6.32). The APA effects were sustained at 6M follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: APA treatments significantly improved pain and function compared to control; effects were sustained at 6M. APA should be recommended as a nonpharmacologic therapy for older adults with cLBP."

This study aims to identify, describe, and map the current evidence that used acupressure for CRL prevention and management. METHODS: This review was conducted following Arksey and O'Malley's methodology and Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for scoping reviews. A systematic search was performed in eight English databases and four Chinese databases from inception to Oct 20, 2023, and updated on July 20, 2024. Reference lists were hand-searched. Two independent reviewers performed study selection and data extraction. Disagreements were solved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. A narrative synthesis was performed to summarize and synthesize the findings. RESULTS: A total of 16 articles published from 2010 to 2023 were included. The majority of the studies (n ​= ​11) were from China. There were six randomized controlled trials (RCTs), four quasi-experimental studies, one retrospective cohort study, one qualitative study, three reviews, and one report. Nine studies examined acupressure, one employed tuina, and one utilized Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation. Neiguan (PC 6), Hegu (LI 4), Jianjing (GB 21), Quchi (LI 11), Chize (LU 5) were most commonly used acupoints. The dosage varied among studies. Acupressure was performed by trained nurses or patients. Acupressure showed improvements in lymphedema management, limb function, quality of life, and inflammatory factors. CONCLUSIONS: The review concluded the effectiveness of acupressure in CRL prevention and treatment. Further rigorous research is recommended, particularly well-designed RCTs involving diverse populations."

The study was conducted to determine the effect of Korean hand acupressure applied after thyroidectomy on the number and severity of postoperative pain, nausea, vomiting, and retching. DESIGN: An experimental study with a post-test control group design involving randomized groups. METHODS: The study was conducted with 42 patients who underwent thyroidectomy between February 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022. Korean hand acupressure was applied to the intervention group for 3 minutes using mung bean seeds 30 minutes before anesthesia. The application was continued every 2 hours and terminated at the eighth hour after the surgery. Pain severity, the number severity of nausea, vomiting, and retching, antiemetic use, and Rhodes Nausea, Vomiting and Retching Index score were assessed at the 2nd, 6th, and 24th hours postoperatively. FINDINGS: The number and severity of retching in the intervention group at the sixth hour postoperatively was significantly lower than the control group (P < .05). The number and severity of nausea in the intervention group at the 2nd, 6th, and 24th hours after the surgery, as well as the number and severity of vomiting and retching at the 2nd and 6th hours after the surgery, were found to be clinically significant compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Korean hand acupressure was an effective nursing intervention for reducing the number and severity of retching at the 6th hour after thyroidectomy and also reduced the use of antiemetics."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to significant clinical physical and psychological manifestations during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, leading to significant distress and impaired functional capacity. Given the side effects caused by pharmacotherapy, it seems logical to use non-pharmacological methods that can reduce symptoms such as menstrual stress. Thus, this study has been conducted to compare the effect of teaching coping skills and acupressure on premenstrual stress in undergraduate students of the Medical School of Azad University of Sanandaj-Iran. METHOD: This study is an experimental study that was designed in the form of three groups (two acupressure and coping strategy groups and one control group). The participants by moderate or severe degree based on the Symptoms Premenstrual Screening Tool entered the study. Students in the coping skills training group received intervention for 5 weeks and every week for 60 min. The second intervention group received acupressure intervention for 3 months and twice a day for 60 s each time, in a sitting position, with pressure on the 6th spleen point (SP6). Data collection tools included socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics questionnaire, as well as premenstrual stress questionnaire and stress coping styles questionnaire, which were completed before and 3 months after the intervention. ANCOVA test was used for comparing the variables of premenstrual stress and coping strategy between the investigated groups, controlling the scores of premenstrual stress and coping strategy before the intervention, as well as controlling those socio-demographic variables that had a significant difference between the two groups. RESULTS: Based on the ANCOVA test adjusted based on the age of first menstruation and pre-intervention premenstrual stress scores, the mean post-intervention premenstrual stress scores in the acupressure group [adjusted mean difference (AMD): - 20.6; 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): - 23.1 to - 17.1; P < 0.001] and coping strategy group [AMD: - 20.5; 95% CI - 23.4 to - 16.7; P < 0.001] were significantly lower than that of the control group. Also, based on the post-hoc test, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of the mean post-intervention PMS scores between the two acupressure and the coping strategy groups [AMD: - 0.1; 95% CI - 3.5-2.9; P = 0.995]. Also, the mean post-intervention scores of task-oriented coping subscale [AMD: 30.8; 95% CI 25.6-36.1; P < 0.001] as well as avoidance-oriented coping subscale [AMD: 18.2; 95% CI 14.6-21.8; P < 0.001] were significantly higher than those of the control group, yet in terms of the emotion-oriented coping subscale [AMD: - 26.9; 95% CI - 31.1 to - 22.7; P < 0.001], the scores were significantly lower than those of the control group. CONCLUSION: Considering the effect of learning coping strategies and applying acupressure in reducing the symptoms of premenstrual stress, it seems that equipping people with coping skills allows them to cope with stressful situations such as premenstrual syndrome and show a better and more logical response and feel less anxiety, depression, physical problems, and social problems. Furthermore, acupressure can also be used as a non-invasive method alone or as a complementary medicine in reducing the symptoms of premenstrual stress in young girls.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity frequently persists into adulthood and is associated with an increased risk and earlier onset of cardiovascular disease in later life. Behavioral change strategies have been proposed as the first-line weight management approach for children and adolescents with obesity. Nonpharmacological interventions, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) auricular acupressure treatment and intermittent low-carbohydrate diet (ILCD), are increasingly being investigated in the young obese population. However, there is limited high-quality evidence about effectiveness and safety in weight control and reducing cardiometabolic risk in the pediatric population. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effect of cardiometabolic risk reduction between TCM auricular acupressure treatment (TAAT) and ILCD in children with overweight or obesity with gastric-heat and dampness-obstruction syndrome. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants are children with overweight or obesity and enrolled at the obesity clinic of the department of TCM at a tertiary children's hospital. Eligible participants must meet the following criteria: (1) be aged between 6 and 18 years, (2) be overweight, and (3) have gastric-heat and dampness-obstruction syndrome. Recruited children will be randomized 3:1 to receive either TAAT or a self-administered ILCD for 1 month: 150 in the TAAT group and 50 in the ILCD group. The primary outcome is the change in body weight from the beginning of treatment to the end of 1 month. Secondary outcomes included body weight, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, BMI, blood pressure, body fat content, indexes of liver and renal function, indexes of glucose metabolism, gut microbiota, and TCM syndrome scores at the end of 1 month and 3 months, respectively. Primary statistical analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat strategy. A generalized linear model was used to compare the difference in weight change between the groups, with the baseline body weight as the covariate, to obtain the estimate of the mean difference in body weight change and its 95% CI, using Gaussian for family function and identity for link function. RESULTS: The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethical committee and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on May 5, 2023, before recruitment. Recruitment began in June 2023 and is expected to be completed by December 2025. As of November 2024, we have enrolled 112 participants. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial will provide evidence on the treatment effects and safety of TAAT versus ILCD among children with overweight or obesity with gastric-heat and dampness-obstruction syndrome, in reducing body weight and improving cardiometabolic risks. Exploratory aims include potential underlying mechanisms of the 2 kinds of interventions, based on biosamples.

Acupressure is widely used to improve sleep quality in hospitalized patients, but its overall effectiveness is unclear. This meta-analysis aims to analyze the efficacy of acupressure therapy on sleep quality and sleep parameters in adult inpatients. Eight electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials published before April 2024. Two researchers independently screened, assessed, and extracted data from the included studies. A total of 41 studies involving 3680 subjects were included. The meta-analysis showed a significant difference between the acupressure and control groups in sleep quality (SMD = -1.58, 95% CI [-1.85, -1.31]), total sleep time (SMD = 1.12, 95% CI [0.40, 1.83]), sleep efficiency (SMD = 0.90, 95% CI [0.29, 1.52]), sleep onset latency (SMD = -0.73, 95% CI [-1.14, -0.33]), and wake after sleep onset (SMD = -1.32, 95% CI [-2.55, -0.09]). The meta-regression results suggested that the number of sessions daily and the duration of each session were significant factors influencing heterogeneity. Acupressure is an effective intervention to improve sleep quality and sleep parameters in inpatients.",

      "abstract": "Context: Intense, uncontrolled pain during labor can have negative outcomes for both the mother and the baby, but this can be prevented by utilizing pain-relieving techniques. Childbirth is a natural physiological process, and it is important to prioritize non-pharmacological methods such as acupressure in managing the associated pain. Objective: The present research aims to determine the effects of acupressure on the eighth point of the extra-back meridian (EX-B8) for pain relief during childbirth in primiparous women. Design: This study was a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled trial. Setting: This study was conducted at Shahid Rasulullah Hospital in Nikshahr, Sistan and Baluchistan Province, Iran. Patients or Other Participants: Ninety primiparous mothers in the active phase of the first stage of labor were selected and randomly divided into three groups: acupressure on EX-B8 (n = 30), sham (n = 30), and control group (n = 30). Intervention(s): The acupressure and sham groups received acupressure for 20 min during their uterine contractions at three different time points: when cervical dilatation was at 4-5 cm, 6-7 cm, and 8-10 cm, totaling 60 min. The control group received routine labor care. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pain intensity was assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) before, 10 min after, and 20 min after the start of the intervention at three different time points. Results: Pain intensity was significantly lower in the EX-B8 acupressure group compared to the sham and control groups at all three time points of the intervention (p < 0.05). In the EX-B8 group, the greatest amount of pain relief was achieved during dilatation of 8-10 cm, compared to dilatations of 4-5 and 6-7 cm (p=0.0001). Maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly between the three groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The current study found that applying acupressure on EX-B8 effectively reduced pain during labor. Acupressure on this point can be recommended as an effective, low-cost, and accessible pain-relieving technique, especially at the end of the active phase of the first stage of labor. Further studies are needed to determine why acupressure on this point is more effective at the end of the active phase of labor.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The fatigue-sleep disturbance-depression symptom cluster (FSDSC) is commonly experienced by breast cancer (BC) survivors, leading to a deteriorated quality of life (QoL). Somatic acupressure (SA) has been recommended as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for cancer-related fatigue (the core symptom of the FSDSC) in the guidelines, showing its encouraging role in relieving cancer-related sleep disorders, fatigue and depression. This phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) is designed to evaluate the effects, safety and cost-effectiveness of SA for managing the FSDSC in BC survivors. METHODS: This phase III RCT will be a partial-blinded, sham-controlled, three-arm, parallel clinical trial, involving a 7-week SA intervention period and a 12-week follow-up period. 108 BC survivors will be randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1:1 to either a true SA group (self-administered acupressure plus usual care), a sham SA group (self-administered light acupressure at non-acupoints plus usual care) or a usual care group. The primary outcomes will be the effectiveness of SA on the FSDSC at both the individual symptom level and cluster symptom level. Each individual symptom will be specifically measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (fatigue), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (sleep disturbance) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression (depression). The cluster symptom level will be measured by using an FSDSC composite score, an averaging score of three separated 0-10 numeric rating scales for fatigue, depression and sleep disturbance. The secondary outcomes will include QoL (measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast), adverse events and cost-effectiveness. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (week 0), immediately after intervention (week 7) and follow-up (week 19). All outcomes will be analysed based on the intention-to-treat principle using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS 25) software. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approvals of this study have been granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee at Charles Darwin University (H22110) and the Clinical Trial Ethics Committee at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (KLL-2023-594), and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (KYLL-2023-058).

METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with noise-induced tinnitus admitted to the Sandun branch of Zhejiang Hospital from June 2020 to June 2023 and included 100 patients for analysis. Based on the different treatments, the patients were divided into a conventional therapy group (methylcobalamin tablets for 4 weeks, n = 52) and an auricular point acupressure therapy group (methylcobalamin tablets and auricular point acupressure therapy for 4 weeks, n = 48). The baseline characteristics, tinnitus loudness, hearing thresholds, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Evaluation Questionnaire (TEQ), and clinical efficacy were assessed before and after treatment. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment, compared with the patients in the conventional therapy group, those in the auricular point acupressure therapy group had an advantage in tinnitus loudness, hearing thresholds, and THI and TEQ scores, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The clinical effectiveness in the auricular point acupressure therapy group was significantly higher than that in the conventional therapy group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Auricular point acupressure therapy has a substantial effect on the treatment of noise-induced tinnitus. It is superior to conventional therapy in reducing tinnitus loudness and hearing thresholds. As a noninvasive therapy, auricular point acupressure has the potential to be an adjuvant therapy for noise-induced tinnitus.",

METHODS: This was a prospective, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial implemented at Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine. Between October 2022 and February 2023, 190 hospitalized patients undergoing colonoscopy were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group received auricular acupressure during bowel preparation, whereas the control group received no additional treatment. Analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat method. Intervention effects were evaluated by comparing outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: The overall incidence of ADRs to bowel preparation in the intervention group (37/95 = 37.89 %) was lower than that in the control group (59/95 = 62.11 %, P < 0.05). Compared with control group, the incidence of nausea in the intervention group decreased by 15.79 %(95%CI 0.03-0.19, P = 0.018), whereas no significant difference was observed in the incidence of abdominal distension(P > 0.05). Regarding the comparison of the severity of the ADRs, the overall score of ADRs and the scores for nausea and abdominal distension in the intervention group were statistically lower than those in the control group (all P < 0.05). No auricular acupressure-related adverse effect was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Auricular acupressure can significantly decrease the incidence of ADRs to colonoscopic bowel preparation in patients and alleviate the severity of nausea and bloating symptoms, which is a safe, simple, and effective method.

Insomnia is a common complaint in breast cancer patients, more than one-third (38-47%) of breast cancer patients suffer it. Auricular acupressure (AA), a non-pharmacological therapy, has been used in the studies to intervene in insomnia in breast cancer patients. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the efficacy and safety of AA therapy in intervening with insomnia in breast cancer. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for 10 databases up to January of 2024 to identify randomized control trials (RCTs). The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed independently using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The quality of evidence was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Data were screened and extracted independently using predesigned forms. The meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software, P-value < .05 means statistically significant. RESULTS: This review included 15 studies from 3 different countries with a total of 1125 adult participants. The pooled results showed that AA significantly in improving sleep quality (mean difference [MD] = -3.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [-4.65, -2.07], P < .001) and life quality (MD = -7.82, 95% CI: [-14.76, -0.88], P = .03). Based on data from sleep monitoring devices, AA was valuable for improving sleep efficiency (MD = -3.63, 95% CI: [-4.19,-3.07], P = .03) in breast cancer patients. Adverse events were reported in 5 RCTs. Common adverse reactions include auricular skin allergic reaction (10/259, 3.9%), bruising (7/259, 2.7%), pain (3/259, 1.2%), and local pressure ulcers on the auricular points (2/259, 0.8%). The evidence grade was moderate because of the substantial heterogeneity among studies. Heart, Shenmen, and Subcortex were the 3 most numerous auricular points, with a total share of up to 71.70%. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates the efficacy and safety of AA in intervening insomnia in breast cancer patients, providing a basis for the selection of clinical auricular points. However, the high-quality RCTs in existence are not enough, and more rigorous trials are needed to identify the efficacy of AA and insomnia.",

DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was conducted on databases ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCO and PubMed. METHODS: The Modified Jadad scale was used. The statistical analysis was conducted using the Stata 15.0 software, with the aim of evaluating heterogeneity between studies using both chi-square and I2 statistics. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using both the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and statistical tests. A funnel plot was used to detect potential publication bias, which is indicated by an asymmetry in the plot. The Egger regression test was also performed to evaluate publication bias. RESULTS: Twelve studies were selected for the meta-analysis. All studies included in this meta-analysis were of good quality. In the subgroup analysis, it was determined that massage and acupressure reduced the severity of restless legs syndrome as a result of the intervention, while reflexology had no effect. Interventions did not affect the sleep quality of patients. Restless legs syndrome severity was significantly reduced in studies using oil and in studies that intervened for more than 15 min per session. CONCLUSION: Interventions applied to haemodialysis patients with restless legs syndrome can reduce the severity of restless legs syndrome. It is recommended to conduct randomised controlled trials that determine the effects of methods on restless legs syndrome severity and sleep quality in haemodialysis patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lower limb fractures cause local pain, swelling, ecchymosis, and dysfunction. Clinically, incision and reduction surgery are often employed to treat lower limb fractures. However, postoperative pain can be intense, leading to adverse emotions that hinder subsequent recovery. METHODS: A total of 99 postoperative patients with lower limb fractures were randomly divided into 3 groups: the control group (routine care, 33 patients), the auricular acupressure group (routine care plus auricular acupressure, 33 patients), and the combined group (routine care, auricular acupressure, and emotional freedom techniques [EFT], 33 patients). Pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS), and anxiety levels were measured using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) at various time points post-intervention. Patient satisfaction with nursing care was also evaluated at the end of the intervention. RESULTS: The VAS scores in the combined group were significantly lower than those in the auricular acupressure and control groups at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-intervention (P < .05). Additionally, the SAS scores in the combined group were significantly lower than those in the auricular acupressure and control groups at 72 hours post-intervention (P < .05). The combined group also reported significantly higher satisfaction with nursing care compared to the other 2 groups at the end of the intervention (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Auricular acupressure combined with EFT effectively reduces pain levels, alleviates anxiety, and increases patient satisfaction with nursing care in postoperative patients with lower limb fractures.",

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of auricular acupressure on comfort, pain intensity, and physiological indices after coronary angiography. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This two-arm (1:1) randomized controlled trial was conducted at Farshchian Heart Center, Hamadan (western Iran) from April to June 2024. Eighty-four eligible patients were split into intervention (n = 42) and control (n = 42) groups. In the intervention group, Vaccaria seeds were stuck at the right ear's TF2, SF5, HX1, and AT2 points for 2 h post-angiography. The control group received no acupressure. The Numeric Rating Scale measured comfort and pain intensity, and physiological indices such as mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation were measured before acupressure and at 60- and 120-min post-intervention. RESULTS: Analysis of 83 patients showed no significant demographic and clinical differences between groups pre-study (P > 0.05). Significant pain intensity and comfort improvements were noted in the intervention group compared to the control group at 60 and 120 min post-intervention (P < 0.05). Additionally, significant reductions in heart rate and mean arterial pressure were observed in the intervention group (P < 0.05), while no significant differences were found in arterial oxygen saturation between the intervention and control groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Auricular acupressure, an easy, simple, low-cost complementary method, could help in pain management, increase comfort after coronary angiography, and positively affect mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Nurses can play a crucial role in applying these techniques, ensuring proper implementation, and educating patients about their benefits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acupressure is a popular form of complementary nursing among adults. It stimulates the body's self-healing processes by enhancing energy flow, or \"chi,\" along meridian channels. Acupressure can address many health issues and is also used on children because it is painless and straightforward. Although acupressure has existed for centuries, research on its applications for children remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to categorize and synthesize the research conducted over 30 years on acupressure in children. DESIGN: A scoping review. DATA SOURCE: The databases searched were PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Wiley, Medline EBSCO, and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria were original peer-reviewed articles in English or Indonesian that used acupressure as an intervention for children in any setting from 1991 until March 2022 and were updated until March 2024. REVIEW METHODS: This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual Methodologies. Subsequently, the retrieved articles were imported into the EndNote program version 20. Based on the identification results, 2924 articles were obtained, and 76 articles were retained. The review decision process was depicted in a PRISMA flow diagram. RESULTS: Of the 76 articles, 72% came from the Asian continent, 66% were published within the past ten years, and 59% were randomized controlled trials. Acupressure was most used (48%) by school-age children (7-12 years), with commonly targeted points being Neiguan (P6), Zusanli (ST36), Hegu (LI4), Yintang (Extra1), and auricular acupoints. Acupressure on children can be administered by acupuncturists, nurses, doctors, caregivers, and parents, offering six main benefits: alleviating nausea and vomiting, relieving pain, decreasing anxiety, relieving fatigue, increasing visual function, and increasing weight and height. CONCLUSION: Acupressure offers numerous advantages for children with various conditions. Healthcare and nursing professionals should consider using it as a complementary intervention to address issues and problems in healthy and sick children. However, further studies are needed to evaluate its effectiveness."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) significantly impacts patients' quality of life, with existing treatments offering limited relief. Self-administered acupressure presents a potential non-invasive, cost-effective treatment option that could alleviate symptoms and enhance health outcomes in these patients. AIM: This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effect of active acupressure compared to sham acupressure on primary and secondary outcomes among IBS-D patients. METHOD: The study included 63 patients with IBS-D, recruited from Alexandria Main University Hospital, Egypt. Participants were randomized into either an active acupressure group or a sham acupressure group. Both groups underwent two days of training, followed by four weeks of intervention. The active group applied pressure to specific therapeutic acupoints, while the sham group used non-therapeutic points. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, week 2, and week 4. RESULTS: The active acupressure group showed a significant reduction in symptom severity, improved stool consistency, and frequency, and greater adequate symptom relief by week 4 compared to the sham group. Psychological outcomes, including anxiety and depression, also improved significantly in the active group. Additionally, the active group reported reduced use of rescue medications. CONCLUSION: Active acupressure is an effective nursing intervention for alleviating symptoms of IBS-D, particularly when applied consistently over time. It improves both physical and psychological outcomes, offering a valuable non-pharmacological treatment option. IMPLICATIONS: Nurses can integrate self-administered acupressure into IBS-D care plans, teaching patients this technique to manage symptoms independently, thus enhancing their quality of life (QOL) and reducing reliance on conventional medications. This intervention aligns with holistic nursing care and offers a cost-effective, patient-friendly solution for managing IBS-D.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical method is one of the conventional methods of reducing labor pain. Acupressure is suggested as an effective method for reducing labor pain with favorable effects on the outcome of childbirth. Different acupressure methods are suggested for this purpose; the most effective one has to be investigated. Therefore, the present study compared the effect of two of the most effective acupressure methods, namely lumbar rotation in a standing position and the 6th splenic point (SP6) acupressure, in the active phase of labor on pain intensity, duration of labor, and childbirth experience among nulliparous women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this semi-experimental randomized clinical trial, 126 nulliparous women in Bint Al-Huda Hospital, Bojnourd, Iran, February-June 2021, were enrolled (by convenient sampling based on the inclusion criteria) and assigned to two interventions and a control group (no intervention). Baseline pain intensity was measured by VAS at a dilatation of 4 cm, immediately after intervention, and at dilation of 8 cm. Group \"A\" received lumbar rotation in standing position and group \"B\" received SP6 acupressure; once at 4 and once at 8 cm dilatation. The length of the active phase and the second stage of labor and the total duration of labor were calculated in minutes. The mothers completed the Walker Birth Experience Questionnaire within 2 h after the labor. Mean values were compared using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, for three groups, with posthoc tests for significant differences) and independent samples t-test (for two groups) using SPSS v.16 and considered significant at P values < 0.05. RESULTS: After the intervention, groups A and B had a lower mean pain intensity (5.80 ± 1.83 and 4.82 ± 2.14, respectively) than the control group (7.70 ± 1.91, P < 0.001) and after the second intervention (8.06 ± 1.55, 7.68 ± 1.60, 9.92 ± 0.36 in groups A, B, and control, respectively; P < 0.001). Labor duration was longer in the control group (228.11 ± 82.31 min active phase; 58.38 ± 23.86 min second stage, and 372.92 ± 114.41 min total) than group B (180.66 ± 60.68, 40.00 ± 18.56, and 310.39 ± 89.66 min, respectively, P < 0.05). The mean total birth experience scores were lower in the control group (63.59 ± 6.59), compared with those in groups A and B (73.14 ± 7.95 and 72.84 ± 8.29, respectively, P < 0.001), and in three dimensions of own capacity, perceived safety, and participation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Lumbar rotation in the standing position and SP6 acupressure had a positive effect on pain intensity, duration of labor, and birth experience."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AI) reduce hormone receptor-positive breast cancer recurrence risk by about 50%. However, half of AI-treated postmenopausal women report new or worsened musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS), and 20% discontinue therapy prematurely. Acupuncture is effective for reducing symptoms, but many women are not able to access acupuncture therapy. We hypothesize that self-administered acupressure will reduce AIMSS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women who have been receiving treatment with an AI for more than 3 weeks but less than 2 years, and who report new or worsened joint pain or myalgias since starting AI therapy with worst pain of at least 4 out of 10 on a numerical rating scale, are eligible. Fifty participants will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to treatment with true or sham acupressure for 12 weeks. Participants will self-apply pressure for 3 minutes to each of the 9 acupoints daily. All participants will complete a pain assessment weekly, and a battery of symptom questionnaires every 6 weeks. Optional stool samples will be collected after 0 and 12 weeks of acupressure to examine changes in the gut microbiome. The primary endpoint is change in worst pain on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form with 12 weeks of the acupressure intervention, evaluated with generalized estimating equations. CONCLUSION: Determination that self-administered acupressure reduces AIMSS in this randomized phase 2 pilot trial will lead to a larger randomized phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the efficacy of self-acupressure. Reduction of AI-related arthralgias may improve persistence with breast cancer therapy, breast cancer outcomes, and quality of life for AI-treated patients.

METHODS: This is a mixed-method acceptability evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial on self-administered acupressure for KOA. Participants received two 2-h training sessions on self-administered acupressure and were instructed to practice twice daily for 12 weeks. Quantitative data were collected using an acceptability questionnaire (n = 153) and acupressure logbooks (n = 157). Qualitative data were obtained through semi-structured interviews, including post-training (n = 13) and post-intervention focus groups (n = 13), and individual interviews with participants who dropped out (n = 5). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and framework analysis based on the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. RESULTS: The intervention had 91.7 % completion rate. Participants rated willingness to attend future sessions at 9.5/10 (SD=0.85). 57.8 % found technique education \"very helpful\" and 81.5 % followed the prescribed routine. Participants reported high overall acceptability of the self-administered acupressure training program, citing its practicality and potential benefits on knee pain, thigh strength, inflammation, and swelling. The minimal time and financial investment required were also appreciated. However, challenges related to personal efforts, time management, pressure from research monitoring, possible adverse events, and uncertainties with acupressure techniques were noted, leading to adherence issues. Participants expressed a need for continuous professional guidance. CONCLUSION: Self-administered acupressure is highly acceptable to middle-aged and older adults with KOA due to its potential benefits and merits of minimal time and cost. Future research should focus on optimizing intervention implementation by providing professional support and efficient monitoring to address identified challenges.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of myopia among Chinese children and adolescents, especially at younger ages, has emerged as a significant concern in recent years. Pre-myopia is a key period for myopia prevention and control in children and adolescents. Previous studies suggested auricular acupressure (AA) therapy might offer a viable approach to prevent and slow down myopia progression. Nonetheless, these studies lack robust, high-quality, large-scale, multi-center evidence to conclusively support such assertions. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and economic benefits of AA therapy in preventing myopia in Chinese children aged 6-12 years with pre-myopia. METHODS: The single-blind, multi-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial will involve 318 pre-myopic children from 20 different centers across China. After recruitment, these participants will be randomly assigned to two groups (the AA group and the control group) at a 1:1 ratio. The AA group will receive auricular point sticking therapy along with health education for a period of 24 weeks, while the control group will be provided the sham AA treatment and routine health education. The assessments of outcomes will be conducted at the start of this study, and then after 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in spherical equivalent refraction at various follow-up times. The secondary outcomes include the number of myopia cases, uncorrected visual acuity, axial length, corneal curvature radius, accommodation amplitude, retinal and choroidal thickness, and eye behavior management. In addition, the cost-effectiveness analysis will be used as the evaluation index for economic assessment. DISCUSSION: The results of this research will provide evidence on the efficacy, safety, and economic benefits of AA therapy in preventing myopia among children aged 6-12 years with pre-myopia in China.",

Current research demonstrates that acupressure can reduce preterm contractions and encourage post-term labor. Sharing acupressure techniques with lay midwives could improve birth outcomes in Guatemala. The purpose of this study was to deliver an educational session for lay midwives to assess their learning and satisfaction with acupressure, and its feasibility and usefulness in their work. METHODS: Two acupressure protocols were designed based on the clinical expertise of University of Utah College of Nursing faculty and extant literature. Demographic data and a pretest were conducted, followed by a focus group and various educational activities. A post-test was administered, and participants were given Spanish-language, laminated Reminder Cards with acupressure point illustrations to reinforce knowledge retention as the group had a low literacy rate. This study was IRB approved. RESULTS: Eleven lay midwives participated (all female, average age 52 with an average of 21 years of lay midwifery experience). Lay midwives lacked knowledge about acupressure before the educational session and were eager to learn. Afterward, most participants recalled six points to discourage preterm labor and six points to encourage post-term labor on a post-test, and expressed an intent to use their new acupressure knowledge with patients. DISCUSSION: This sample of lay midwives eagerly embraced new acupressure information and demonstrated increased knowledge after this educational intervention. Next steps would be to continue to expand lay midwife knowledge and skills in response to their request for acupressure interventions for retained placenta."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain is one of the most common problems after caesarean section (CS). Pain reduction and effective mobilisation after CS positively affect maternal and infant health. AIM: This study aimed to determine the effects of acupressure applied to women after CS on pain intensity and first mobilisation distance. METHODS: The sample of this prospective, two-armed (1:1), double-blind randomised controlled clinical trial consisted of 64 women undergoing CS (32 acupressure and 32 placebo acupressure group). The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, independent-groups t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and simple main-effects analysis. RESULTS: Findings showed statistically significant group effects (F = 19.32, p<.001), time effects (F = 27.67, p<.001), and group- and time-interaction effects (F = 26.60, p<.001) on postoperative pain after CS. In the acupressure group, the VAS scores were lower at 1 min, 2 h and 4 h after the intervention compared to before the intervention (p<.001; p<.001; p=.001, respectively). In the placebo group, the VAS score at 1 min after the application decreased, increasing at 2 h and 4 h, but these changes were not significant (p>.05). The first mobilisation distance of the acupressure group was significantly longer than that of the placebo group (p<.001). CONCLUSION: Acupressure applied to the SP6, P6 and LI4 points was an effective nursing intervention for pain control and mobilisation after CS. Considering the significant impact of pain after CS on maternal and infant health, nurses should include acupressure, which is easy to apply, cost-effective, and efficacious, in postpartum care.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Sexual dysfunction in individuals suffering from depression may be both a symptom of the disorder and a side effect of antidepressants. To date, and to our knowledge, no randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of acupressure on sexual function in women of reproductive age who take antidepressants. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effect of acupressure on sexual function in women of reproductive age taking Selective Serotonin Reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). METHODS: A randomized clinical trial with a control group. In total, 115 women taking antidepressants and suffering from sexual dysfunction were recruited from Shahid Rajaee Hospital in Yasuj, Iran. They were enrolled based on the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to either the acupressure (intervention) or control group. Pressure was applied to subjects in the intervention group at the PC6 and SP6 acupoints, and at placebo points P1 and P2 in the control group. Treatments were administered in a sitting position, twice weekly, for two months. Sexual function was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index at baseline and after the eight-week intervention period. RESULTS: The acupressure group showed significant improvements in desire, orgasm intensity, satisfaction, and total sexual function score compared with the control group (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides important evidence for supporting the use of acupressure at these specific points to improve sexual function in women taking SSRIs. Acupressure may be a practical and effective intervention for mitigating antidepressant-induced sexual function.",

      "abstract": "The first-line treatment for nonspecific low back pain (LBP) relief is physical exercise; however, there is no uniformity in recommendations regarding the type of exercise, and physicians predominantly prescribe pharmacological treatments. This creates a treatment gap in non-pharmacological management of LBP. Preliminary data suggest that manual therapy and acupressure could be relevant therapeutic options. The primary objective of this study was to describe the evolution of pain in patients with nonspecific LBP persisting for at least 4 weeks who received 2 treatment sessions combining manual therapy with acupressure (Biokinergie® method) as part of their routine management. In this prospective, observational, and non-interventional study, participants were monitored on the days of manual therapy session delivery (initial visit on Day 0 and follow-up visit on Day 21). Follow-up assessments occurred 3 days and 3 weeks post-therapy sessions. A total of 114 participants suffering from LBP for a median duration of 11.9 weeks were enrolled from May 2021 to May 2023. The intensity of average pain experienced over a 24-hour period was significantly reduced on Day 24 (-36.0 ± 27.2 mm on a visual analog scale of 100 mm, P < .001), with 82 (75.2%) participants reporting a decrease of at least 20 mm. Participants reported significant reductions in pain (-25.9 ± 23.9 mm on Day 3, -29.7 ± 26.7 mm on Day 21, and -40.9 ± 28.3 mm on Day 42, P < .001) and functional disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score: -5.4 ± 0.4 points on Day 21 and -7.4 ± 0.4 points on Day 42, P < .001). This was associated with an improved Dallas Pain Questionnaire score, indicating a reduced impact of LBP on daily activities (-27.2 ± 2.0% on Day 21 and -35.8 ± 2.0% on Day 42, P < .001). Posttreatment, most participants (86.3%) reported reduced analgesic intake compared to baseline, and 83.3% were very satisfied with the therapy. A significant and clinically relevant reduction in lumbar pain was observed after 2 sessions of manual therapy combined with acupressure, paving the way for future clinical research.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The study was carried out to determine the effects of acupressure and massage on pain severity, menstrual symptoms, and quality of life in patients with primary dysmenorrhea. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted between January 2021 and May 2021. The study initially enrolled 309 female students with primary dysmenorrhea studying at a university in the Central Anatolia Region of Türkiye. After exclusions (due to secondary dysmenorrhea diagnosis, study discontinuation, or drug use), the study was completed with a total of 267 students. The students were divided into three groups as follows: (1) the acupressure+massage group, (2) the massage-only group, and (3) the control group. Acupressure + massage and massage-only groups were timed for the first 3 days of three consecutive menstrual cycles. The primary outcome of the study was the mean pain score for primary dysmenorrhea. Data were collected with the Visual Analog Scale, Daily Menstrual Symptom Rating Scale, and Short Form 12 Health Survey. Results: In the first cycle and first day of preintervention measurement, the physical and mental health levels, which are the subscales of pain severity, menstrual symptom intensity, and quality of life, were similar in the three groups (p > 0.05). In other measurements during the three cycles, it was determined that the pain severity and menstrual symptom intensity in the acupressure + massage and massage-only group were lower than the control group (p < 0.05). After the intervention, it was determined that there was no significant difference in all subscales of the Quality of Life Scale (p > 0.05). In the acupressure + massage group, three participants reported having adverse reactions, including pain at the acupoints (n = 1) and shift in menstruation cycle (n = 2); in the massage-only group, four participants reported having adverse reactions, including redness (n = 3) and tingling in a finger (n = 1). Conclusion: It was determined that acupressure and massage applied to those with primary dysmenorrhea were effective methods to reduce the pain level and menstrual symptom intensity, but did not affect their quality of life. Clinical Trials Number: A Clinical trials number was received from ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04942288).",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The type of study is a randomized study with a post-test-control group. The protocol was prepared according to the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013 checklist. The CONSORT 2017 guideline was followed in reporting the protocol. The study was conducted with 42 patients (intervention/control group = 21) who underwent thyroidectomy in a hospital in Istanbul between February 2021 and June 2022, who met the inclusion criteria, and whose verbal and written informed consent was obtained. Korean hand acupressure was applied for 3 min using mung bean seeds 30 min before anesthesia was given to the patients in the intervention group. The application was continued every 2 h after the operation. The application was terminated at the eighth hour. The control group (patients) received routine post-operative treatment and care. Pain severity, nausea, vomiting, and retching number and severity, antiemetic use, and Rhodes nausea, vomiting, and retching index score at the end of the 24th hour were evaluated at the 2nd, 6th, and 24th hour postoperatively. Data analysis was done with the SPSS 25.0 program. CONCLUSION: For the patients in the intervention and control groups, it was found that the number and severity of nausea and vomiting were highest in the 6th hour after surgery. The application of Korean hand acupressure was an effective nursing intervention on the retching state (number/severity) that developed at the 6th hour after thyroidectomy and reduced the use of antiemetics."

OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the efficacies of combined intervention (CI [AA + PPI]), AA, and PPI in sleep quality enhancement and their potential effects in alleviating negative psychological states in radiotherapy-treated patients with cancer. METHODS: This study was a 4-arm, placebo-controlled randomized trial. We randomly assigned 120 eligible patients into 4 groups (30 patients per group). The main outcomes included subjective sleep quality, psychological distress, and fear of cancer recurrence, which were measured at baseline, immediate postintervention, and 4 weeks postintervention. Objective sleep quality was measured using Fitbit Charge 3 at baseline and immediate postintervention. The intervention effects were estimated using the linear mixed model. RESULTS: The 4 groups demonstrated significant differences in subjective sleep quality (P < .001), psychological distress (P = .004), and fear of cancer recurrence (P < .001). CI, AA, and PPI had different degrees of positive effects on subjective sleep quality compared with sham control; CI was more effective than AA and PPI, whereas AA was more effective than PPI. CI and PPI showed significant and comparable effects on psychological distress and fear of cancer recurrence reduction. Only CI and AA significantly improved the objective sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: CI, AA, and PPI are recommended as complementary therapies to improve the sleep quality of patients with cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In future clinical practice, healthcare workers should assess patients' sleep quality and psychological status and select appropriate interventions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain in the knee joint area and reduced sleep quality are prevalent symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. This study examines the impact of self-administered acupressure on pain severity and sleep quality in patients with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: In this trial conducted in 2023, 126 patients were enrolled. They completed a demographic characteristics form, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Afterward, they were randomly allocated to three groups: acupressure, sham, and control. While the control group received routine care, patients in the acupressure and sham groups were instructed to apply pressure on selected acupoints daily for one minute for a duration of one month. All participants completed the PSQI and the VAS one month after the intervention began and one month after it ended. Data analysis involved Fisher's exact tests, chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and one-way ANOVA tests. Also, per-protocol analyses were conducted with linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: No significant effects associated with group allocation were observed on pain VAS scores in acupressure and sham groups compared to the control group. However, participants in the acupressure group showed a significant decrease in pain VAS scores as time progressed. PSQI scores significantly decreased over time. Interaction effects showed that PSQI scores decreased more in the acupressure than in the control group over time. Finally, PSQI scores in the acupressure group demonstrated a significant decrease from pretest to follow-up, while no significant change was observed over time in the sham group. CONCLUSIONS: Self-administered acupressure may be useful in improving sleep quality in patients with knee osteoarthritis. This work may be informative in developing acupressure interventions with more effective outcomes in future research.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of an auricular acupressure intervention on sleep quality, mood state, and quality of life (QOL) among parents of children with cancer. METHODS: Thirty-five parents were assigned to three-weeks intervention in an active auricular acupressure group (AAG) or a sham auricular acupressure group (SAG). Feasibility was assessed by adherence to the acupressure protocol. Outcomes were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality, the Profile of Mood States for mood, and the QOL short form for QOL. The data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations to identify changes over time within and between the groups. RESULTS: Adherence to the protocol was 78%. There were no differences between the groups in overall sleep quality or mood state, but QOL in the Physical Component Summary was better in the AAG at time 1. Parents in the AAG exhibited significantly higher levels of vigor compared to those in the SAG group. Statistically significant differences were observed in the Physical Functioning and General Health subscales, with the AAG showing better outcomes than the SAG group at time 1 and time 2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Likely due to the small sample size, the AAG and SAG did not differ in overall sleep quality, mood state, or QOL, but there were significant subscale differences that support intervention effectiveness. A fully powered large-scale trial is needed to determine whether this intervention would be effective for parents of children with cancer. Reducing symptom distress and improving QOL in these parents are essential, and interventions to achieve this goal must be tested. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05654155."

PONV not only causes patients discomfort but also leads to serious complications, affecting their health outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of applying auricular acupressure to alleviate PONV and postoperative anxiety and to improve satisfaction with anesthesia care in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery (GLS). DESIGN: A randomized control trial was conducted for this study. METHODS: Eighty patients who received general anesthesia for GLS were recruited at a medical center in northern Taiwan and randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups. Both groups had pellets taped onto different auricular points after the surgery: the stomach (CO4), cardia (CO3), liver (CO12), occiput (AT3), shenmen (TF4), and subcortex (AT4) for the experimental group and the knee (AH4) and thoracic vertebrae (AH11) for the control group. The pellets were removed 24 hours after surgery. The severity of PONV was assessed as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included levels of anxiety and satisfaction with postanesthesia care. FINDINGS: After 24 hours of follow-up, patients in the experimental group reported significantly less PONV and a higher level of satisfaction with anesthesia care compared to patients in the control group. However, the levels of postoperative anxiety between the control and experimental groups were statistically insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that the six auricular points, including CO4, CO3, CO12, AT3, TF4, and AT4, can effectively alleviate PONV and improve the quality of anesthesia care after GLS. Auricular acupressure is a nonpharmacologic treatment for PONV that takes cost and patient satisfaction into consideration."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neck-type cervical spondylopathy (NTCS), a common degenerative disorder affecting the spine, poses challenges for patients and society. Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of traditional tuina techniques in treating NTCS, although some limitations still exist. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of combining regular massage techniques with three methods of neck movement (TCM) therapy for managing NTCS, utilizing musculoskeletal ultrasound measurements. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 70 eligible patients with non-traumatic cervical spondylosis will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the experimental group, which will receive Tuina combined with a three-method neck movement treatment, or the control group, which will receive standard Tui Na manipulation. All participants will receive treatment for four weeks. Assessments will be conducted using musculoskeletal ultrasound, the McGill Pain Scale, and the Neck Disability Index (NDI) at three-time points: before treatment, at the end of treatment, and after 12 and 16 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION: This paper investigates the utility of musculoskeletal ultrasound as a tool for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of an integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) strategy in alleviating pain and enhancing functional outcomes for patients with NTCS. The objective is to present a clinically viable and long-term treatment option.

      "abstract": "This randomized controlled study aims to investigate the effect of acupressure on pain and postpartum comfort following a cesarean section. The study was conducted with 60 women who underwent cesarean delivery. The participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. In the intervention group, acupressure was applied to the LI4, SP6, and P6 points for 15 minutes at the 2nd and 4th hours after the cesarean section. In the control group, acupressure was not applied and only routine nursing care was given. Data was collected using a personal information form, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Postpartum Comfort Questionnaire (PCQ). Acupressure application was applied to the intervention group at the 2nd and 4th hour after cesarean section. All data collection forms were filled out by women in the intervention group before starting acupressure application at 2 hours after cesarean section. VAS was filled out again after acupressure application at 2 hours. VAS was filled out before and after acupressure application at 4 hours after cesarean section. PSQ was filled out in both groups before discharge. In the study, the intervention group's 2nd (3.03 ± 1.24, p < .001) and 4th (4.06 ± 1.22, p < .001) hour posttest VAS scores were lower and PCQ posttest scores (140.6 ± 9.01, p < .001) were higher than the control group. The results indicate that acupressure intervention applied to points LI4, SP6, and P6 was a useful nonpharmacological treatment for postpartum pain and comfort for the study group.",

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether acupressure is effective in treating breast cancer patients' acute nausea and vomiting brought on by chemotherapy as well as delayed nausea and vomiting. METHODS: We systematically searched for Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Clinical Key, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus. Based on the inclusion criteria two reviewers independently identified the articles using key thesaurus and free text terms. The review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. RESULTS: According to the pooled findings, acupressure combined with antiemetics greatly lessens the severity of acute nausea [SMD, (95% CI)] [-0.35(-0.62,-0.08), P=0.01, I2=0%], delayed nausea [SMD, (95% CI)] [-0.52(-0.78,-0.26), P<0.001, I2=16%], and delayed vomiting [SMD, (95% CI)] [-0.46(- 0.83,-0.08), P=0.02, I2=43%] brought on by chemotherapy.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cancer patients are prone to experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and depression after receiving chemotherapy. Research has shown that acupressure may be beneficial in relieving the anxiety and depression caused by chemotherapy, but high-quality evidence is lacking. This study was designed to systematically evaluate the efficacy of acupressure for relieving chemotherapy-induced anxiety and depression. METHODS: This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA framework. Four English databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) and four Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and CBM) were searched from inception to December 31, 2022, to identify randomized clinical trials examining the use of acupressure for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anxiety and depression. Cochrane Review Manager 5.4 and RStudio were used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 1,119 patients from 12 randomized controlled trials. We mainly compared acupressure with sham acupressure and routine nursing. The results showed that acupressure alleviated chemotherapy-induced anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-1.15, -0.28], p = 0.001) and depression (SMD = -0.75, 95% CI [-1.36, -0.14], p = 0.02) more effectively than sham acupressure and routine nursing. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found that acupressure (body point) can relieve chemotherapy-induced anxiety and depression and improve the quality of life of patients. However, the current relevant literature has low quality and is highly heterogeneous, which reduces the credibility of the research results. Therefore, more rigorously designed randomized controlled trials are needed to verify these conclusions.",

METHODS: The study, which was conducted as a prospective randomized controlled study, was carried out with 84 patients: reiki group (n = 28), acupressure group (n = 28), and control group (n = 28). Twenty minutes before the femoral catheter was extracted, 18 minutes of reiki was applied to the seven chakra regions in the reiki group, and 20 minutes of acupressure was applied to the LI4, HT7, and PC6 points in the acupressure group. The control group received standard care. All three groups were given the assessment with Visual Analog Scale, Spielberger State Anxiety Scale, and 5 minutes before & 5 minutes after sheath removal and vital sign data also collected at these time points. RESULTS: After the intervention, it was determined that the pain and anxiety scores of both the reiki and acupressure groups were significantly lower than the pain and anxiety scores of the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, heart rate and respiratory rates were significantly lower than the control groups in the measurements made after the intervention of both reiki and acupressure groups (p < 0.05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures after acupressure, but not after reiki, were significantly lower compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of the study, reiki and acupressure applied before the removal of the femoral sheath after percutaneous coronary intervention reduce pain and anxiety and improve vital signs to some extent.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most clinical trials have reported significant short-term effects of traditional medicine therapies on COVID-19 patients. However, there is no clinical trial to determine the long-term effects of traditional medicine therapies on severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 128 patients with severe COVID-19, who were recruited in our previous clinical trial following hospital discharge, were monitored at months 14 and 28. This trial aims to evaluate the long-term effect of an early Qigong exercise and acupressure rehabilitation program on patients with severe COVID-19.The intervention group received qigong exercise and acupressure therapy, plus standard therapies. The control group received standard therapies.The study was a single-center, parallel, randomized, prospective follow-up study. The outcomes of the study included changes in the modified Borg dyspnea scale (MBS), the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC), the patient health questionnaire-9 scale (PHQ-9), the activity of daily living (ADL), the remaining clinical symptoms and any intervention related adverse events. RESULTS: The intervention group showed a statistically significant improvement in the mMRC scores (-0.4, 95 % CI (-0.6, 0.2), P < 0.001) and the MBS scores (-0.6, 95 % CI (-0.9, -0.3), P < 0.001) after 14 months of discharge compared with the control group. At 28 months of discharge, the intervention group, compared with the control group alone, significantly increased their MBS scores (-0.4, 95 % CI (-0.7, -0.1), P = 0.024) and a significantly decreased positive rate of dyspnea symptoms after 14 months of discharge (P < 0.05). However, ADL and PHQ-9 scores showed no significant difference between the two groups during the follow-up (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: QARP had long-term sustained efficacy for dyspnea, chest tightness, and cough in patients with COVID-19, especially in young and middle-aged patients, and the effect was significant at the 14th month of follow-up.

Auricular acupressure (AA) has attracted growing attention as a complementary treatment for insomnia. Nevertheless, there is a lack of rigorous studies evaluating AA specifically for estazolam-dependent insomnia. Our proposed trial aims to assess the therapeutic effect of AA on estazolam-dependent insomnia. METHODS: This study is a randomized, single-blinded, three-arm controlled trial. No less than 108 participants will be randomized into one of three groups: AA group, sham auricular acupressure (SAA) group, and conventional dosage reduction group. All treatments will be administered for 4 weeks, with a follow-up period of 1 month. The primary clinical outcomes will be estazolam dosing and reduction rates, serum gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and cortisol (CORT) levels. Secondary outcomes will concern the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire (BWSQ). Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed, with the significance level determined as 5%. DISCUSSION: The study results will provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of AA in managing estazolam-dependent insomnia by analyzing its immediate effect, time-effect relationship, and reduction of estazolam use.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIN) significantly impacts cancer patients, leading to functional disability, diminished quality of life, and increased healthcare costs amid the ongoing opioid crisis. Auricular point acupressure (APA), a non-invasive and non-pharmacological alternative, has shown potential for alleviating the pain, numbness, and tingling associated with CIN. This study aims to assess the efficacy of APA for CIN symptoms and physical function and to examine the mechanisms underlying APA's effects on CIN. METHODS: This is a three-arm randomized controlled clinical trial protocol. Patients aged 18 and older who are experiencing CIN are randomly assigned to one of the three groups: an APA group (in-person APA; mAPA), a sham control group (virtual APA; vAPA), and a wait-list usual care control group (UC). During the four-week program, participants in the mAPA receive an in-person APA treatment and training; the sham control participants (vAPA) receive a self-guided smartphone APA application with APA demonstration videos; and the UC participants will continue with the usual care and be re-randomized into one of the APA groups. The primary outcomes are changes in CIN symptoms and physical function. Secondary outcomes include evaluating pain sensory thresholds, motor and cognitive functioning, inflammatory signaling, brain connectivity, opioid use, and quality of life. The outcomes are measured at baseline, program completion (4 weeks), and at monthly follow-up for 3 months post-intervention. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence supporting the potential viability of APA as an intervention for CIN. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID NCT04920097 registered on 3 June 2021.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Point Zero located within the vagus nerve's auricular branch shows promise in addressing imbalances. This study aims to explore its effects on vagal activity using auricular acupressure (AA), measured through heart rate variability (HRV). METHODS: This single-blinded randomized controlled trial involved 114 healthy volunteers randomly assigned to receive AA (AA group, n = 57) or sham-AA (SA group, n = 57) at Point Zero. The 30-minute procedure comprised six stages: T1 and T2 (pre-intervention), T3 to T5 (intervention), and T6 (post-intervention). Interventions involving 30-s acupoint pressure stimulations at T3 and T5. The HRV-measured outcomes included heart rate (HR), standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD), natural logarithm of low-frequency power (LnLF), and natural logarithm of high-frequency power (LnHF). In addition, respiratory rate (RR) was monitored for its stability. RESULTS: The AA group demonstrated a significant decrease in HR and increases in SDNN, RMSSD, and LnHF from stages T3 to T6 compared with T1 (baseline), notably prominent at T3 (median changes [25th; 75th percentiles]: -2 [-5; -1], 17.85 [9.65; 31.72], 4.9 [1.08; 10.65], 0.26 [0.00; 0.62], respectively) and T5 (-3 [-6; -1], 19.45 [10.6; 32.89], 6.17 [-0.17; 16.34], 0.40 [-0.14; 0.83], respectively), while the SA group did not. LnLF showed nonsignificant alterations, and RR remained stable in both groups. Despite minor HRV fluctuations, the AA group consistently displayed significantly higher changes in SDNN and RMSSD compared with the SA group from T3 onwards. HR remained unchanged at T6, and LnHF significantly differed only at T5. CONCLUSION: AA at Point Zero may promptly enhance vagal activity, evident in the modulation of HRV, notably pronounced with pressure stimulation, and can be sustained for at least 5 min. Further studies are needed to assess its long-term effectiveness and efficacy in preventing or treating patients.(Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05586698)."

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of acupressure on preoperative anxiety, postoperative pain, and nausea and vomiting in otolaryngology patients. DESIGN: The study was designed as a prospective, assessor-blinded, parallel, 2-armed (1:1), randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The sample of this study consisted of 60 otolaryngology patients. Patients were assigned to the acupressure (n = 30) or control (n = 30) groups (1:1) through randomization. During the preoperative period, participants in the acupressure group received a 15-minute treatment involving pressure applied to the HT7, LI4, and EX-HN3 points. No intervention was administered to participants in the control group. Preoperative anxiety levels were evaluated using the State Anxiety Scale both before and 15 minutes after the acupressure application. Postoperative pain was assessed using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale at 4 hours postoperatively, at 10:00 p.m., at 08:00 a.m., and upon discharge. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were assessed at discharge using the Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching. FINDINGS: Although the preoperative anxiety of the control group increased in the operating room waiting area, that of the acupressure group decreased significantly (P = .033). The postoperative pain severity levels of the 2 groups were similar at the fourth hour after surgery and at 10:00 p.m. (P > .05), whereas they were significantly lower at 08:00 a.m. (P = .04) and discharge (P = .048) in the acupressure group. No significant difference was found between the groups in postoperative nausea and vomiting symptoms (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure was effective in reducing the severity of preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain in otolaryngology patients, but the same effect was not observed in postoperative nausea and vomiting.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the effects of auricular acupressure (AA) on neck pain and stress in nursing students with neck pain. METHODS: This single-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled comparative pretest-posttest study involved administering AA for four weeks. The subjects included nursing students experiencing neck pain. The experimental group comprised 17 subjects, and the control group comprised 14 subjects. In the experimental group, AA was applied to the Shenmen, cervical vertebrae, shoulder, and liver areas to improve neck pain and reduce stress. In the control group, AA was applied to the anus, rectum, urethra, and external genitalia areas, which are not associated with neck pain and stress. To assess the intervention effects, NRS (Numeric Rating Scale), NDI (Neck Disability Index), and PSS (Perceived Stress Scale) scores were measured. RESULTS: The NRS scores in the experimental group with AA significantly decreased over time (F = 7.463, p < .001). The between group and group-by-time interaction results were F = 8.564, p = .007 and F = 3.252, p = .025, respectively. The NDI scores in the experimental group showed a statistically significant difference between the groups (F = 13.762, p = .001); however, there were no significant differences over time or in the group-by-time interaction (F = 1.086, p = .347) (F = .301, p = .757). The PSS scores in the experimental group decreased significantly over time (F = 5.557, p = .013), but there were no significant differences between the groups (F = .636, p = .432) or in the group-by-time interaction (F = .063, p = .891). CONCLUSION: AA applied for four weeks was found to be safe, noninvasive, and effective in reducing neck pain in nursing students with cervical pain.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The most important cause of death among cardiovascular diseases is coronary artery disease (CAD). Pain and insomnia symptoms are the most common symptoms in CAD patients. Acupressure is used in patients with CAD as one of the energy-based complementary and alternative methods. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of self-acupressure on pain and sleep quality in patients with coronary artery disease. DESIGN: This is a randomised controlled trial. METHODS: This study was conducted between June and August 2021 with a total of 80 participants, 40 in the intervention and 40 in the control group. The participants in the intervention group were asked to perform a total of 16 sessions for 4 weeks, 2 days a week in the morning and afternoon, for a total of 23 minutes, depending on the preparation and compression time to be performed on 5 points. The control group did not receive any intervention during the study. Data were collected by using Descriptive Information Form, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: After self-acupressure, the VAS total score of the intervention group decreased significantly compared to the control group (t=-11.861; p<.05). After intervention PSQI total and subscale mean scores of the intervention group decreased significantly compared to the control group (t=-7.767; p<.05). It can be seen that self-acupressure application has a negative and significant effect on PSQI total mean scores and VAS total mean score of patients (p<.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that self-acupressure was effective in improving the pain and sleep quality of patients with coronary artery disease. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Self-acupressure is an accessible and inexpensive method, it is recommended to be supported and maintained in the management of coronary artery disease in nursing practice.",

METHODS: A randomized controlled design was used. The study was conducted with a total of 146 women, including 41 acupressure, 31 laughter yoga, 37 mindfulness-based stress reduction, and 37 control group women. The women in the acupressure group were administered acupressure twice a week, which accounted for 16 sessions in total. Women in the laughter yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction groups received a total of eight sessions of the related intervention, which was performed once a week. Study data were collected using a participant information form, the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), and the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Scale (MENQOL). Descriptive statistics, paired-samples t test, χ 2 test, analysis of variance test, and intention to treat analysis were used to analyze the data. Before the intention to treat analysis was performed, the multiple imputation method was employed to deal with missing data. RESULTS: In the study, it was found that there was a decrease in the MRS total score after the intervention in women in all three intervention groups compared to the control group ( P < 0.05). In the laughter yoga group, total MRS scores decreased by 3.16 points ( P < 0.05). In the acupressure group, total MRS scores decreased by 5.46 points ( P < 0.05). In the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program group, total MRS scores decreased by 4.65 points ( P < 0.05). It was determined that the mean scores of women in the laughter yoga and acupressure groups on all subscales of the MENQOL decreased after the intervention compared to the control group ( P < 0.05). The comparison of the MBSR group and the control group showed that there was a decrease only in the psychosocial domain subdimension of the MENQOL ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it was determined that laughter yoga, acupressure, and MBSR could be effective in reducing menopause symptoms and improving quality of life, although findings require further testing in a rigorously controlled study and in a study with only a single prespecified outcome.",

The intervention involved 8 weeks of auricular acupressure using ear seeds on five acupoints associated with obesity and sleep. Obesity outcomes were assessed using anthropometric indices (body weight, BMI, waist circumference, body fat mass, body fat percentage), while sleep outcomes were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and actigraphy. Measurements were taken thrice: before the intervention, and at 4 and 8 weeks post-intervention start. The experimental group demonstrated a significant reduction in obesity measures and improvement in sleep quality over time compared to the control group. The findings suggest that auricular acupressure may serve as an alternative nursing intervention for managing obesity and improving sleep quality in middle-aged women."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV and PONV) are common during cesarean delivery (CD) with neuraxial anesthesia. Limited information exists on the antiemetic benefit of combined P6 acupoint stimulation with acupressure (P6 acupressure) and pharmacologic antiemetics on preventing IONV and PONV after CD. This study assessed the antiemetic efficacy of P6 acupressure compared to a non-P6 acupoint stimulation with acupressure (sham acupressure) in preventing IONV during CD. METHODS: We performed a randomized double-blinded trial comparing the efficacy of intraprocedural P6 acupressure versus sham acupressure in preventing IONV during CD after following the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology enhanced recovery recommendations. Subjects were instructed to apply additional pressure at the acupressure sites when they perceived nausea. The primary outcome was the incidence of IONV, and the secondary outcome was the need for rescue antiemetic treatment. RESULTS: Ninety-nine P6 acupressure and 100 sham acupressure subjects were studied. There was no difference in the incidence of intraoperative nausea (67%), vomiting (17%), emesis episodes, or the need for rescue antiemetics intraoperatively. There were also no differences in the incidence of PONV and antiemetic treatment from PACU to discharge. At discharge, 70% of respondents reported experiencing nausea, but only 10% reported it affected self-care. Approximately 50% of the patients in both groups were satisfied with acupressure therapy. CONCLUSION: P6 acupressure did not reduce the incidence of IONV or PONV when combined with antiemetic therapy per enhanced recovery recommendations. There does not appear to be sufficient evidence to support using P6 acupressure for IONV prevention.",

This study explored the effect of auricular acupressure on relieving negative psychology in the women during the COH stage of IVF treatment. Infertile women were enrolled and randomly divided into three groups: control (n = 121), auricular acupressure (n = 126), and sham acupoint (n = 121). The group allocation was blinded to the participants. The auricular acupressure (AA) group selected four auricular points: Shenmen, Kidney, Endocrine, and Internal genitalia. The sham acupoint group (SA) used four irrelevant auricular points and the control group accepted only routine IVF treatment. The intervention lasted from the first day of COH until the day before transvaginal oocyte retrieval. Participants' psychological states were measured using the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) before and after auricular acupressure. IVF outcomes were followed up. There were significant increases in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and anxiety in the control and SA groups. Additionally, the SA group showed a higher somatization symptom score, after COH. The AA group showed decreased somatization symptom, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, and anxiety scores after COH. The AA group showed lower obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, and anxiety scores compared to those in the control and SA groups. The auricular acupressure was correlated with higher IVF success. Auricular acupressure may alleviate the psychological and emotional problems of IVF participants during the COH period.",

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of auricular acupressure, which is considered a noninvasive, convenient, and safe method for pain reduction and heart rate variability in patients after surgery. A total of 62 patients who underwent cervical spine surgery were randomly divided into experimental (32 patients) and control (30 patients) groups. Both groups received routine care, whereas the experimental group received auricular acupressure three times a day for four days. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire was administered, and heart rate variability measurements were obtained on the first, second, third, and fourth postoperative days. The results indicated that auricular acupressure was effective in reducing pain ( P < .05) and improving heart rate variability ( P < .05) in patients. Based on the findings, this study suggests that auricular acupressure can be used as a complementary treatment to reduce pain in patients after cervical spine surgery."

The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility of delivering an acupressure protocol for the treatment of iatrogenic withdrawal in a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit as well as impact and acceptance of acupressure as an adjunct treatment. DESIGN: Randomized pilot feasibility trial. METHODS: Acupressure stickers were applied and rotated to one ear every 1-3 days until withdrawal symptoms improved. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events, with only one reported incident of skin irritation. Recruiting benchmarks were exceeded. Weaning phases were significantly shorter in the acupressure group (medians 6.0 vs 22.0 respectively, p = .025, d = 0.90) and the control group used skin-to-skin contact as a comfort measure significantly more than the acupressure group (42.9% vs 6.3%, p = .18). Acupressure was accepted by parents, with an overall 96.2% rating their experience as positive, as measured by the Parent Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. The majority of health care providers (n = 19) were supportive, with 71.9% agreeing or completely agreeing acupressure is an acceptable adjunct for the treatment of withdrawal symptoms; 26.8% were neutral, as measured by the Acceptability of Intervention Measure, Intervention Appropriateness Measure, and Feasibility of Intervention Measure. CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure was found to be safe, feasible, and accepted by health care providers in a pediatric cardiac intensive care setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty-eight, 8-12 years participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allotted to either group I (three-point acupressure) (n = 84) or group II (control) (n = 84). All children were subjected to a self-report measure of anxiety [Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale (MCDAS)] 30 minutes before starting and after completing the dental treatment. For group I children, acupressure beads were applied on selected three acupoints for approximately 10 minutes and were left adhered in place. After 20 minutes, anxiety scores were recorded for all the children and allotted treatment procedure was initiated. For group II children, the same methodology was followed except for the application of acupressure beads. Frankl behavior (FB) rating scale, pulse rate (PR), and systemic saturation levels of oxygen were also recorded as secondary outcome measures. The data obtained was analyzed statistically using Chi-squared analysis, t-test, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) along with post hoc Bonferroni test. Significance level was predetermined at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: At time frame (TF)-2, significant decrease in anxiety scores was observed in acupressure group irrespective of the treatment procedure, whereas in control group, it increased significantly. PR was also increased in acupressure group and FB scale was improved. In control group, PR increased and behavior was not improved. Between TF-2 and 3, no reduction in anxiety score was observed. CONCLUSION: The three-point acupressure therapy reduces anxiety in children undergoing dental procedures when compared to nonacupressure group and the difference was statistically significant. Acupressure is a noninvasive stimulation technique applied to acupoints and can be easily administered by a trained pediatric dentist. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Sisodia M, Kaur H, Garg N, et al.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility and the effect of implementing a self-administered acupressure intervention on symptom burden and quality of life for in-center HD patients. DESIGN: A pilot randomized controlled study. SETTING: Two outpatient community HD clinics between in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. PATIENTS OR SAMPLE OR PARTICIPANTS: Patients on HD for at least 3 months and with at least one symptom score rated greater than moderate were eligible for the study. METHODS: Participants were randomized into either the (1) self-acupressure + usual care or (2) usual care alone group. Participants in the acupressure group were given a wooden acupressure tool and taught how to self-administer protocol on 6 acupressure sites for the 4-weeek study duration. Feasibility outcomes were assessed through satisfaction surveys and attrition. Other outcomes included quality of life and symptom scores by validated questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L and Integrated Palliative Outcome Score-Renal [IPOS-Renal]). RESULTS: Thirty-two participants were successfully enrolled in the study; acceptability was high with study completion at 98% in the intervention group and 82% adherence rate to the 4-week protocol. Participants in the intervention group reported an improved change score in quality of life (EQ-5D-5L Index Score change = +0.053; EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale score change = +6.7). Participants in the intervention group also reported improved symptom scores (IPOS-Renal overall change = -2.8). LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and intervention duration are limitations of this pilot study. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that self-acupressure was acceptable and feasible in this sample of HD patients. Self-acupressure may have a role for supporting the management of symptoms in HD patients. These pilot results can be used to inform larger more definitive investigations."

However, the therapeutic mechanisms remain obscure. AIM: To explore the effects of PIN combined with acupressure massage on CS postoperative recovery. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 150 pregnant women admitted to an obstetrics department between January 2020 and January 2023. The control group (CG) received acupressure therapy (n = 73), and the intervention group (IG) received acupressure therapy and PIN therapy (n = 77). Postoperative recovery time was assessed by anal-exhausting, defecation, bed activity, breastfeeding, and hospital stay times. Adverse effects, including infection, bleeding, limb numbness, intrauterine hematoma, urinary retention, and venous thromboembolism, were recorded. the pain visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the degree of pain. Anxiety and depression status were qualitatively assessed using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS). The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was used to compare sleep quality between the groups. RESULTS: The baseline data and SAS, SDS, EPDS, and PSQI scores did not significantly differ before CS (P > 0.05) and neither did complication rates between the two groups after CS (P > 0.05). However, anal-exhausting, defecation, waking up, breastfeeding, and hospitalization times were significantly shorter for participants in the IG than those for participants in the CG (P < 0.05). The VAS, SAS, SDS, EPDS, and PSQI scores of the IG were significantly lower than those of the CG (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PIN, combined with acupressure massage, effectively promotes maternal recovery, reduces post-CS pain, and improves postoperative negative emotions and sleeping quality."

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of acupressure on Spleen 6 and Hugo points on the severity of postpartum pain. METHODS: In this parallel randomized trial study, 68 eligible primiparous women who had vaginal deliveries and experienced postpartum pain at Farabi Hospital in Malekan (a city in East Azarbaijan Province in Iran) were selected according to inclusion/exclusion criteria and then allocated to the Hugo (n = 34) and Spleen 6 (n = 34) acupressure groups using a randomized block design (six blocks). The data collection process took place from November 2022 to April 2023. The participants were blinded; however, the analysts and investigators were not blinded. Acupressure interventions were applied bilaterally for 20 min, consisting of 10 s of pressure followed by 2 s of rest. Pain intensity was assessed using a visual pain scale before, immediately after, and 1 h after the intervention. In total, 68 participants fulfilled the study. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25 with chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and Friedman tests. RESULTS: Both groups exhibited a statistically significant reduction in postpartum pain intensity across all periods (p < 0.001). Although there was a significant difference in pain intensity between the groups before the intervention (p = 0.039), this distinction was not observed immediately and 1 h after the intervention (p ≥ 0.05). Both Hugo and Spleen's 6 acupressure interventions reduced postpartum pain intensity. No significant adverse events or side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Acupressure on Spleen 6 and Hugo points helped decrease the severity of postpartum pain in primiparous women who had vaginal deliveries. Healthcare providers are encouraged to consider acupressure for postpartum pain management."

Materials and Methods: A systematic search on six electronic databases was performed from their inception to May 7, 2023, to identified relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two independent reviewers screened the abstracts and full texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using RoB 2. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability. The secondary outcomes were pain pressure thresholds, pain catastrophizing level, and fear avoidance beliefs. A random-effects model was used for meta-analyses. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Sensitivity analyses were conducted after removing low-quality papers. Results: Of 633 identified records, six studies involving 496 participants were included. All included studies compared the effectiveness of AA with sham controls in treating various chronic musculoskeletal pain. Four meta-analyses were conducted to compare the effectiveness of AA with sham controls. Low-quality evidence supported that AA had a large effect size on postintervention subjective pain reduction (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.36 to -0.54; p = 0.00; I2 = 52.61%); moderate-quality evidence substantiated that AA had a large effect size on enhancing postintervention pressure pain threshold (SMD = -0.55; 95% CI: -0.88 to -0.23; p = 0.00; I2 = 0%). There was low-quality evidence that AA had a large effect on reducing postintervention disability (SMD = -0.68; 95% CI: -1.24 to -0.12; p = 0.02; I2 = 51.33%). Our sensitivity analysis reaffirmed the same conclusion regarding pain reduction immediately after the intervention. Fourteen participants reported minimal adverse events, including soreness, tenderness, irritation, and redness, which disappeared within 1-7 days. Discussion: Our systematic review revealed that AA significantly improved pain, pressure pain thresholds, and disability in individuals with various chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions immediately post-treatment compared with sham treatment. Given the paucity of studies and inconsistent protocols, future RCTs are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of AA in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain at a longer follow-up with detailed protocols, which allows researchers and clinicians to optimize AA intervention. Conclusion: AA has immediate post-treatment benefits for chronic musculoskeletal pain, whereas its effects at the 1- or 6-month follow-up remain uncertain.",

This commentary addresses several concerns with the Feinstein (2023) review including the pseudoscientific concept of energy meridians, the lack of evidence that tapping on acupressure points is the active ingredient that resolves psychological disorders, serious methodological flaws with EFT research, and the incompatibility of EFT with the ethical practice of psychology. Thus, we disagree with Feinstein's (2023) conclusion that \"The body of research on acupoint tapping that has emerged over the past two decades and the increasing quality of the study designs appears promising\" (p. 61) and instead argue that EFT represents a pseudoscientific, \"unsinkable rubber duck\" (i.e., a belief that people continue to hold despite evidence to the contrary)."

To prioritize patient safety in clinical settings, it is important and necessary to address and mitigate the symptoms of cognitive failure among nurses. AIM: This study was conducted in Iran to evaluate the impact of ear acupressure on occupational cognitive failure in nurses. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted with 54 nurses who experienced cognitive failure in 2022. Sampling was performed by convenience. Fifty-six nurses who scored 40 or higher on the occupational cognitive failure questionnaire were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (28 subjects) or the sham group (28 subjects). In the intervention group, pressure was applied to the shen-men point, zero point, hippocampus, master cerebral, brain, and memory 1 and 2 of the earlobes for six weeks using Vaccaria seeds. In the sham group, a sticker without seeds was applied at the same points as in the intervention group, and no pressure was applied. Cognitive failure was assessed at the beginning of the study (T0), at the end of the intervention (sixth week of study, T1), and four weeks after the end of the intervention (tenth week of study, T2). The data were collected using contextual data questionnaires and the Occupational Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (OCFQ). The data obtained from 54 nurses (28 in the sham group and 26 in the intervention group) were analyzed by SPSS v16 using repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: The two groups had no significant differences regarding background variables. The between-group analysis revealed a significant interaction effect of time and intervention on cognitive failure (F = 60.320, p < 0.001, effect size = 0.537). The cognitive failure score in the intervention group was significantly lower at the end of the intervention and one month later than that in the sham group (p < 0.001). Within-group analysis revealed a significant difference in the cognitive failure scores of the intervention group at T0, T1, and T2 (61.231 ± 14.230, 34.000 ± 14.659, and 29.808 ± 14.266, respectively; F = 52.331, p < 0.001, effect size = 0.677). However, in the sham group, the cognitive failure score exhibited a brief but significant increase at T0, T1, and T2 (54.786 ± 11.239, 56.250 ± 10.950, and 56.000 ± 11.337, respectively; F = 6.369, p = 0.006, effect size = 0.191). CONCLUSION: Auriculotherapy has shown promise in improving occupational cognitive failure in nurses. It is recommended that nurses consider incorporating auriculotherapy as a complementary treatment modality, particularly through self-treatment programs, when experiencing symptoms of cognitive impairment.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of auricular point acupressure in relieving postoperative pain and reducing anxiety among patients with perianal abscesses. METHODS: We included 61 patients with perianal abscesses who were admitted to the Nantong First People's Hospital between July 2019 and June 2020 and were scheduled to undergo one-stage radical surgery. We divided them into the treatment group (n = 31), where patients were administered preoperative auricular acupressure targeting the bilateral Shenmen, subcortical, and other points. They were instructed to apply pressure five to six times per day, each time for about 3-5 min. Patients in the control group (n = 30) received routine preoperative preparation. The treatment duration for both groups was one week. We compared the two groups using the pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores, the use of additional postoperative analgesics, and scores on the Hamilton anxiety and depression scales pre- and post-surgery at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 1 week after surgery, as well as at the time of the first bowel movement. RESULTS: Patients in the treatment group reported lower VAS scores than those of the control group at 48 h, 72 h, 1 week, and at the first defecation post-surgery, and the differences were statistically significant (all P < 0.05). Additional postoperative analgesics were used in seven patients in the treatment group (22.58 %) and in 10 patients in the control group (33.33 %). The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (χ2 = 0.88, P = 0.35). Postoperative scores for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that auricular point acupressure was effective in alleviating postoperative pain in patients with perianal abscesses and simultaneously reduced their postoperative psychological stress reactions. This dual effect provided both pain relief and a reduction of anxiety with fewer adverse reactions, making it a safe and effective treatment option.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sleep disturbance is a very common problem among breast cancer patients, and auricular acupressure is a non-pharmacologic intervention to improve the sleep quality. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of auricular acupressure to improve sleep quality in breast cancer patients. METHODS: Overall, 8 electronic databases in English and Chinese were systematically searched from inception to August 12, 2023 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The risk of bias was assessed by version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0). RESULTS: A total of 16 studies with 1199 participants were included. The synthesized results showed that compared with the control group, auricular acupressure had a significant effect on improving the effective rate of sleep quality improvement in patients with breast cancer (risk ratio [RR] 1.56, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 2.14; P < 0.001), and that significantly reduced the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score (mean difference [MD] -3.47, 95 % CI -4.37 to -2.58; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of effective rate and PSQI score showed similar significant effects. Additionally, the improvement of sleep quality was better when auricular acupressure was performed by nurses using Vaccaria seeds. Furthermore, the optimal intervention program was performed 1-2 times a day, 3-5 min each time, and lasted for 2-4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Auricular acupressure may effectively improve the sleep quality of patients with breast cancer. However, more rigorously designed, large-sample, multi-center RCTs are required to further validate the results.",

      "abstract": "AIM: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of acupressure on comfort, anxiety, stress, depression, and vital signs in patients undergoing coronary angiography. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on patients who underwent coronary angiography in Tehran, Iran. Seventy patients were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The intervention protocol consisted of 20 min of acupressure applied to the Yintang point, and standard medical care was applied to the control group. Depression, Anxiety, and Stress questionnaire (DASS-21), General Comfort Questionnaire (GCQ) questionnaires, and standard monitoring were used as data collection tools before and after intervention, as well as after angiography. Data were analyzed using an independent sample t-test, chi-squared, and analysis of variance of repeated measures in SPSS software, and the level of significance was set at 0.05. FINDINGS: The results showed that before acupressure, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Anxiety and stress scores and comfort levels decreased significantly after the intervention (p < 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in the depression score (p = 0.873). There was a significant decrease in the blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Acupressure can reduce the anxiety and stress of angiography candidates and make them more comfortable. It also reduces the blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate. Further studies at different pressure points and on a larger and more detailed scale are necessary.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among leukemia patients, sleep disruptions are prevalent and can profoundly affect their overall quality of life. Acupressure and foot reflexology, modalities rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, have garnered attention for their potential to address sleep disturbances and mitigate associated symptoms. METHODS: This research utilized a randomized controlled trial with a pretest-posttest design involving 102 leukemia patients admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital in Urmia. Participants were randomly allocated to 3 groups: acupressure (n = 34), reflexology (n = 34), or control (n = 34). Prior to the intervention, patients completed a demographic survey and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for baseline assessments. Acupressure involved stimulation of the SP6 point twice daily for 10 minutes over 4 weeks, while reflexology entailed daily 10-minute sessions with sweet almond oil on the soles for the same duration. The control group received standard care without additional interventions. Following the 4-week intervention period, post-intervention evaluations were conducted using identical measurement tools. RESULTS: The findings underscored the efficacy of both acupressure and foot reflexology in significantly improving sleep quality within the intervention groups (P < .001). Initially, there were no notable differences in sleep quality among the 3 groups (P > .05). Subsequently, pairwise comparisons adjusted with Bonferroni corrections revealed significant disparities in sleep quality between the acupressure and reflexology groups compared to the control group (P < .001). However, post-intervention analysis indicated no statistically significant variance in enhancing sleep quality between the acupressure and foot reflexology groups (P < .05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that acupressure and foot reflexology interventions can enhance sleep quality in individuals with leukemia. These findings support the effectiveness of these complementary modalities, offering targeted relief and relaxation. While these non-invasive therapies show promise in improving well-being, further research is needed to confirm and expand upon these results due to study limitations.",

The study seeks to determine whether acupressure can be used as an alternative to medication for pain relief, as medications often come with side effects. This study aims to evaluate the effect of acupressure on pain levels and physiological indicators in patients undergoing LC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted on 81 patients who underwent LC at Al-Zahra Hospital of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, in 2022. The patients were divided into two groups: the intervention group, which received acupressure (42 participants), and the control group (39 participants). The selected pressure points were LI11, LI4, SJ5, HT7, P6, and K1. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and the pain level was evaluated using the visual analogue score (VAS). The data was analyzed using SPSS version 16 software with a significance level of p < 0.05. RESULTS: The intervention and control groups were homogeneous in terms of age, gender, duration of surgery, and pethidine consumption (p > 0.05). The average VAS significantly decreased in both the intervention and control groups (p < 0.001). The intervention group had a significantly higher reduced score compared to the control group, 30 min and 72 h after applying acupressure (p < 0.001). Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), and breath rate (BR) (p < 0.05).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue, a major health concern among patients receiving hemodialysis, is associated with poor quality of life, negative emotions, and cognitive dysfunction. Acupressure is a low-cost and noninvasive traditional Chinese therapy that has been widely used in community and clinic settings. However, the beneficial effects of acupressure on various aspects of fatigue among these patients have not been systematically investigated. PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine the effects of acupressure on fatigue in patients receiving hemodialysis. The moderating influences of bio-sociodemographic characteristics and methodology on the association between acupressure and posthemodialysis fatigue were also examined. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched for qualified articles published between database inception and November 2, 2022. Only randomized controlled trials designed to investigate the effects of acupressure on fatigue in patients receiving hemodialysis were qualified for consideration. A random-effects model was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials with 11 effect sizes and 725 participants were included in this study. In these studies, acupressure was found to have a significantly higher alleviation effect on general fatigue (g = -0.78; 95% confidence interval [-1.09, -0.48]) and the behavioral, emotional, sensory, and cognitive domains of fatigue (g = -0.51, -0.51, -0.72, and -0.41, respectively) among patients receiving hemodialysis than those in the control groups. Furthermore, the stimulation of the Shenmen acupoint was found to increase the effects (p < .01) of acupressure on fatigue reduction significantly. Notably, the use of special equipment to perform the acupressure was not found to significantly improve outcomes (p = .99). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Acupressure is effective in alleviating fatigue in patients receiving hemodialysis, particularly when the Shenmen acupoint is used together with other acupoints, and is effective without the application of special equipment. Acupressure may be adopted as a complementary therapy for fatigue alleviation in patients receiving hemodialysis. Based on the findings, healthcare providers should coach patients receiving hemodialysis with fatigue on how to use acupressure therapy appropriately to alleviate this health concern.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: The aim of this study is to test whether acupressure for patients with fatigue is an efficient nursing intervention and if it can be implemented into the European nursing care pathways (ENP) nursing classification system. BACKGROUND: Previously, interventions for acupressure were included nonspecifically in ENP and therefore were not available for standardized nursing documentation in an electronic health record (EHR). INTRODUCTION: Acupressure is a nursing intervention that is increasingly used in specific settings. ENP is a nursing classification system that provides evidence-based nursing interventions for nursing diagnoses. METHODS: A systematic international literature search was conducted from May 2021 to December 2021. An iterative, hierarchical search process according to the 6S evidence pyramid was chosen. The results were reported following the PRISMA statement. RESULTS: Findings of 49 included publications that studied a total of 1,716 patients indicate that certain acupressure points may be efficient in treating fatigue. DISCUSSION: Acupressure is a useful nursing intervention and can really help patients experiencing fatigue. It is illustrated how the findings have been implemented in the development of ENP nursing interventions to document acupressure. CONCLUSION: The acupressure points most frequently used on the ear with positive effects in improving fatigue are Shen Men, liver, spleen, subcortex, endocrine, heart, and sympathetic, while the most common points on the body are ST 36, SP 6, LI 4, HT 7, KID 1, Ex-HN 3, Ex-HN, and KID 3. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING: In the future, nurses will be able to use ENP to quickly and easily document acupressure interventions for fatigue in the EHR. In the EHR, the documentation of the nursing process with ENP could help to promote research into evidence-based approaches to fatigue by generating mass data on the different concepts of acupressure, which could lead to a clearer determination of the evidence and contribute to the safety of care and patients.",

Due to the restriction of expiratory airflow, it is characterized by emphysematous destruction of the lungs. Shortness of breath is one of the main clinical symptoms. Auricular acupressure is a clinical therapy characteristic of Chinese medicine that treats the disease by compressing ear points. Usually, the seeds of Vaccaria segetalis are used to stimulate ear points, which has the effect of regulating qi and alleviating wheezing. In this paper, we propose this characteristic therapy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the clinical symptoms of wheezing of lung and kidney qi deficiency type in stable COPD patients. Ear points are selected as the treatment protocol for Lung (CO14), Spleen (CO13), Kidney (CO10), Shen Men (TF4), and Ping Chuan (AT1.2.4i) points. The protocol describes a case study using auricular acupressure for a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to relieve wheezing symptoms.",

Peripheral sensory stimuli, including Thai acupressure, can improve proprioceptive function and decrease FOG episodes. Here, we sought to determine the efficacy of acupressure as a self-treatment to alleviate FOG in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: We conducted an open-label, controlled trial of 60 PD patients with FOG while medicated, randomised into two groups: an active-treatment group using silicone pads to apply pressure to plantar acupoints on the head of the big toe and the base of the first metatarsal bone on each foot for 6 s using patient body weight while seated, repeated four times for each acupoint bilaterally, and a sham-treatment group using a similar protocol without the silicone pads. The primary outcome was stride length. Secondary outcomes included FOG episodes, FOG duration, percent duration of FOG to total gait time (%FOG), and gait parameters. A baseline-adjusted analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with the sham treatment, the active treatment increased stride length, gait velocity, and cadence (all p < 0.001), and decreased FOG episodes and duration (both p < 0.001), %FOG (p = 0.011), and double-support time (p < 0.001). No adverse effects were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure using silicone pads to stimulate plantar acupoints for self-treatment is a noninvasive, simple, safe way to improve gait and alleviate FOG in patients with PD.

However, only a few clinical trials are investigating biomarkers to prove this objectively. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effect of acupressure and curcuminoids on inflammatory markers and pain in older people with osteoarthritis genu. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted among older people with osteoarthritis. All participants were randomized to a group that received 30 mg of curcuminoids in turmeric extract capsules and acupressure (group 1) or a group that received a placebo and sham acupressure (group 2) for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The study was approved by the research ethics board; ClinicalTrials.gov reviewed this protocol. The extracts were manufactured from May 2023 to June 2023. Participant recruitment was conducted in September and October 2023; a total of 72 participants aged 60 years or older participated, of whom 75% (n=54) were female. Data were analyzed in April 2024, and dissemination of results is expected by the end of 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Primary outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Relationships were assessed with inflammatory markers, endorphin hormones, and blood level of cycloxygenase-2 hormone. Additionally, secondary outcomes included pain, ability to perform activities of daily living, and quality of life. The beneficial effects that may be found in this trial may be exceptionally relevant in clinical practice, justifying this scientific inquiry. The benefits of herbs and acupressure can be helpful as additional options in treating inflammation and pain in patients with osteoarthritis.

METHODS: The study was conducted with 66 pregnant women who met the sampling criteria and participated voluntarily at a public hospital in Nicosia. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a massage group, an acupressure group, or a control group. Participants in the massage group received 10 min of sacral massage during contraction and 10 min of endorphin massage during rest, for a total of 30 min of massage per phase. Participants in the acupressure group received 3 min of acupressure to the LI 4 point at the same dilation intervals, when the contraction was most intense. The control group received no intervention. Pain perceived by the pregnant woman was evaluated with the Visual Comparison Scale (VAS) at the beginning and end of each phase. Postpartum, the Birth Satisfaction Scale was applied. RESULTS: Massage application was found to be more effective in reducing labor pain than acupressure or the control group. Massage and acupressure did not negatively affect APGAR scores. The lowest oxytocin use was found in the massage group. The group with the highest birth satisfaction scores was also the massage group. CONCLUSION: Massage application is more effective than acupressure application in reducing labor pain and increasing birth satisfaction.",

RESULTS: The intervention group had fewer behavioral problems at all 3 timepoints than the control group (Cohen's ∂ = 1.49; 95% confidence interval at week 4: 20.97, 47.43).The ear acupressure group had a large effect size with respect to reduction of attention problems at week 4 (∂ = 1.88) and week 8 (∂ = 1.48) than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Ear acupressure induced significant reduction of the behavioral problems of children with ADHD. Further research can evaluate the use and continuity of the effectiveness of this treatment as a complementary treatment in addition to the usual treatments for these children."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of current pharmacological treatment after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is limited. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after LSG remains high. Auricular acupressure (AA) is believed to relieve PONV after laparoscopic surgeries, but its role in patients with obesity after LSG has yet to be confirmed. METHODS: Ninety-five female patients who underwent LSG were randomized into two groups: AA combined with conventional anti-nausea medication (AA group, 47 patients) or conventional anti-nausea medication group (control group, 48 patients). Index of nausea and vomiting and retching (INVR) scores, postoperative anti-vomiting medication use, time of first anus exhausting, time of first fluid intake, and time of first to get out of bed were collected within 48 h after surgery. RESULTS: Demographic data of patients in both groups were balanced and comparable. INVR score (F = 7.505, P = 0.007), vomiting score (F = 11.903, P = 0.001), and retching score (F = 12.098, P = 0.001) were significantly lower in the AA group than that in the control group within 48 h postoperatively. Use of metoclopramide was significantly less in the AA group than in the control group (4.7 [5.5]) vs. 8.8 [7.6], P = 0.004); time to first anus exhausting was significantly less in the AA group than in the control group (17.50 [6.00] vs. 20.42 [8.62], P = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: AA combined with conventional anti-vomiting agents can alleviate PONV in female patients after LSG, and AA can promote gastrointestinal exhaustion. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) with the registration no. ChiCTR2100047381 on June 13, 2021.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The effects of self-administered acupressure (SAA) on knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of SAA taught via a short training course on reducing knee OA pain in middle-aged and older adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted among community-dwelling individuals in Hong Kong who were aged 50 years or older with probable knee OA from September 2019 to May 2022. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention included 2 training sessions for SAA with a brief knee health education (KHE) session, in which participants practiced acupressure twice daily for 12 weeks. The control group (KHE only) received only education about maintaining knee health on the same schedule and duration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score at 12 weeks. Other outcomes included Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index, Short Form 6 Dimensions (SF-6D), Timed Up and Go, and Fast Gait Speed tests. RESULTS: A total of 314 participants (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [4.5] years; 246 [78.3%] female; mean [SD] knee pain duration, 7.3 [7.6] years) were randomized into intervention and KHE-only groups (each 157). At week 12, compared with the KHE-only group, the intervention group had a significantly greater reduction in NRS pain score (mean difference [MD], -0.54 points; 95% CI, -0.97 to -0.10 points; P = .02) and higher enhancement in SF-6D utility score (MD, 0.03 points; 95% CI, 0.003 to 0.01 points; P = .03) but did not have significant differences in other outcome measures. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve demonstrated a greater than 90% probability that the intervention is cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of 1 GDP per capita. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, SAA with a brief KHE program was efficacious and cost-effective in relieving knee pain and improving mobility in middle-aged and older adults with probable knee OA.

METHODS: 120 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who were scheduled to undergo PKEP at the Department of Urology, Jintan People's Hospital Affiliated to Jiangsu University from January 2020 to December 2022, were randomly divided into 4 groups after voluntarily signing informed consent. Three days before the operation, 30 patients were given oryzanol tablets 5 mg orally once a night (placebo group), 31 patients were given Semen vaccariae seeds auricular acupressure (auricular acupressure group), 29 patients were given finasteride 5 mg orally once a night (finasteride group), and another 30 patients were given auricular acupressure combined with finasteride 5 mg orally once a night (combination therapy group). The above treatment was continued for 6 weeks after PKEP. The general data of the perioperative period and the 6-week postoperative follow-up results of the 4 groups were compared to observe the indicators such as the symptom score of nocturia, the self-rating depression scale, and the quality of life (QoL) after treatment among the groups. RESULTS: All patients who underwent PKEP completed the 6-week postoperative follow-up and no statistical difference in the relevant data of the 4 groups was found before the operation. After 2 and 4 weeks of follow-up, the nocturia symptom scores of the auricular acupressure group and the combination therapy group were better than those of the placebo group and the finasteride group. The depression symptom scores and QoL results showed that the auricular acupressure group, finasteride group, and combination therapy group were superior to the placebo group (P<0.05). After 6 weeks of follow-up, QoL in the combination therapy group was 1.65±0.55, which was significantly different from that in the other three groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Combined application of auricular acupressure and 5α-reductase inhibitor can significantly alleviate symptoms such as nocturia and depression and improve the quality of life in BPH patients after PKEP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: From the end of 2019 to December 2023, the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic. The scope and ultimate repercussions of the pandemic on global health and well-being remained uncertain, ushering in a wave of fear, anxiety, and worry. This resulted in many individuals succumbing to fear and despair. Acupoint massage emerged as a safe and effective alternative therapy for anxiety relief. However, its efficacy was yet to be extensively backed by evidence-based medicine. This study aimed to enhance the clinical effectiveness of acupoint massage and extend its benefits to a wider population. It undertakes a systematic review of the existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the impact of acupoint massage on anxiety treatment, discussing its potential benefits and implications. This research aims to furnish robust evidence supporting anxiety treatment strategies for patients afflicted with COVID-19 disease and spark new approaches to anxiety management. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the evidence derived from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quantifies the impact of acupressure on anxiety manifestations within the general population, and proposes viable supplementary intervention strategies for managing COVID-19 related anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review included RCTs published between February 2014 and July 2023, that compared the effects of acupressure with sham control in alleviating anxiety symptomatology as the outcome measure. The studies were sourced from the multiple databases, including CINAHL, EBM Reviews, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science. A meta-analysis was performed on the eligible studies, and an overall effect size was computed specifically for the anxiety outcome. The Cochrane Collaboration Bias Risk Assessment Tool (RevMan V5.4) was employed to assess bias risk, data integration, meta-analysis, and subgroup analysis. The mean difference, standard mean deviation, and binary data were used to represent continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1,110 studies of potential relevance, 39 met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The majority of the studies reported a positive effect of acupressure in assuaging anticipatory anxiety about treatment. Eighteen studies were evaluated using the STAI scale. The acupressure procedures were thoroughly documented, and studies exhibited a low risk of bias. The cumulative results of the 18 trials showcased a more substantial reduction in anxiety in the acupressure group compared to controls (SMD = -5.39, 95% CI -5.61 to -5.17, p < 0.01). A subsequent subgroup analysis, based on different interventions in the control group, demonstrated improvement in anxiety levels with sham acupressure in improving changes in anxiety levels (SMD -1.61, 95% CI: -2.34 to -0.87, p < 0.0001), and blank controls (SMD -0.92, 95% CI: -2.37 to 0.53, p = 0.22). CONCLUSION: In the clinical research of traditional Chinese medicine treatment of anxiety, acupressure demonstrated effectiveness in providing instant relief from anxiety related to multiple diseases with a medium effect size. Considering the increasing incidence of anxiety caused by long COVID, the widespread application of acupressure appears feasible. However, the results were inconsistent regarding improvements on physiological indicators, calling for more stringent reporting procedures, including allocation concealment, to solidify the findings."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acupressure and reflexology on fatigue in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. METHOD: In this randomized controlled trial with three arms and a pretest-posttest design, 102 CLL patients were randomly allocated to acupressure (n = 34), reflexology (n = 34), or control (n = 34) groups. Pre-intervention assessments were conducted using a demographic questionnaire and a fatigue scale for cancer patients. The acupressure group received routine care with acupressure targeting the SP6 point for 10 min twice daily over four weeks. The reflexology group received daily 10-minute reflexology sessions over four consecutive weeks following the preparation and lubrication of the soles of their feet with sweet almond oil. Post-intervention assessments were administered to all groups using the same instruments. RESULTS: Results showed both acupressure and reflexology significantly reduced fatigue compared to the control group (P < 0.001). While differences were noted between acupressure, reflexology, and control groups initially, the post-intervention analysis revealed no significant variance between acupressure and reflexology in reducing fatigue (P < 0.05), suggesting similar improvement between acupressure and reflexology. CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure and reflexology are recommended as cost-effective and low risk complementary approaches for managing fatigue in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. These therapies offer promise in alleviating fatigue and enhancing the quality of life for cancer patients.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the impact of acupressure on bowel function after cesarean delivery. DESIGN: A randomized-controlled experimental study was conducted. PARTICIPANTS: The study population comprised postpartum women who underwent cesarean delivery at Ondokuz Mayıs University Health Practice and Research Hospital between July 2021 and January 2022. The sample consisted of 61 postpartum women (acupressure group: 31, control group: 30). INTERVENTION: Participants were divided into two groups: the acupressure group and the control group. Women in the acupressure group received 14 minutes of acupressure application to the LI4 and TH6 points twice, once within the first postoperative hour and again three hours later. The control group received no acupressure intervention. OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were collected using a Postpartum Information Form and a Post-cesarean Follow-up Form. Statistical analyses included the Mann-Whitney U test, Student's t test, and chi-squared analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of postpartum women in the acupressure group was 27.61±4.39, while in the control group, it was 28.50±3.85.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the most prevalent and distressing side effects of chemotherapy among patients with cancer worldwide. Despite continuing advances in antiemetic medicines, nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy remain a substantial therapeutic concern for many patients. However, P6 and Auricular acupressure (AA) have been recognized as potential therapy for managing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of P6 and Auricular acupressure (AA) in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting among patients with cancer. And to explore a prominent and effective evidence-based protocol for implementing acupressure to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. METHOD: This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Several databases were used to search for eligible studies using specific keywords. Only systematic reviews and clinical trials on acupressure for managing CINV among adults with cancer were included. This review covered articles published in English from 2015 to 2022. RESULTS: A total of 14 published studies were included in this review study; 10 articles were trial studies, and the other 4 were systematic review and meta-analysis studies. The quality of 10 included clinical trials were assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for quantitative studies, the overall result showed that 40% of study rated with moderate quality, no study was rated with low quality, and (60%) studies rated as high-quality study. As well as the quality assessment of all review studies showed that the majority of included systematic reviews and meta-analysis with a low risk of bias and high to moderate power of evidence. In all included studies the acupressure was utilized as a primary complementary intervention for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. The result of this extensive and comprehensive review the P6 and auricular acupressure is an effective complementary therapy in reducing and controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting among participants with various types of cancer and receiving various types of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The successful and effective application of acupressure in managing CINV for certain types of cancer had been supported in previous literature as a safe, affordable, and non-invasive alternative to pharmaceutical medications. However, standardization guidelines regarding the use of acupressure independently or in combination with other pharmacological therapies to address CINV in various cancers require immediate attention.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of auricular acupressure combined with Tongtian Oral Liquid for immediate pain relief in patients with acute migraine without aura, and to analyze the risk factors that affect the number of acute attacks of migraine without aura. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data of 180 patients diagnosed with acute migraine without aura who were admitted to Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine). The patients were divided into an intervention group 1 (n=60), an intervention group 2 (n=60), and a control group (n=60) according to different treatment methods. The intervention group 1 received auricular acupressure + Tongtian oral liquid, the intervention group 2 received Jing point bloodletting + Tongtian oral liquid, and the control group received ibuprofen + flunarizine. Before treatment, 60 minutes and 120 minutes after treatment, the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the short-form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ) were used to score the pain in the three groups to evaluate the efficacy of immediate analgesia. Symptoms including fatigue, drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting after 2 hours of treatment were observed. The amount of ibuprofen used within 24 hours was calculated. The drug treatment was continued for one month. The frequency of migraine attacks was compared among the three groups. The relevant factors affecting the number of migraine attacks were analyzed. RESULTS: The VAS and SF-MPQ scores of the three groups were all decreased 120 minutes after treatment as compared with those before treatment (P<0.01). The decline rate in the intervention group 1 > that in intervention group 2 > that in control group (P<0.01). The immediate analgesic efficiency at 60 minutes, intervention group 1 > intervention group 2 > control group (100% vs. 76.67% vs. 56.67%, P<0.001). After 2 hours of treatment, more cases of fatigue and lethargy occurred in the control group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in nausea and vomiting among the three groups (P>0.05). The 24-hour ibuprofen dosage and headache recurrence ratio, control group > intervention group 2 > intervention group 1 (P<0.05). The number of headache attacks within 30 days was significantly higher in the control group than in the intervention groups (P=0.012). There was no significant statistical difference between the two intervention groups (P=0.568). Regression analysis found that age (OR=1.036, 1.006-1.068), body mass index (OR=1.101, 1.008-1.201), hypertension (OR=2.879, 1.187-6.986), chronic gastritis (OR=2.839, 1.213-6.647), children with educational problems (OR=0.333, 0.164-0.676), and residual fatigue symptoms (OR=4.539, 1.828-11.271) affected the number of headache attacks within the one month of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Auricular acupressure combined with Tongtian Oral Liquid can relieve the acute pain of migraine without aura and reduce the number of pain episodes. The curative effect of this combination is better than that of western medicine alone."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of ginger with P6 acupressure in preventing and treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in cancer patients. METHOD: A total of 172 participants were randomly divided into the control, ginger, acupressure, and joint groups, who were hospitalized in the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from February and September 2022. The baseline characteristics, nausea, vomiting, and retching, benefit finding, functional living index-emesis, treatment satisfaction, and adverse reaction, were used in data collection. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in benefit finding and adverse reactions among the four groups (P > 0.05). Ginger significantly improved delayed CINV and function living index-nausea (P < 0.05) but had no significant effect on acute CINV, retching, and delayed vomiting, functional living index-emesis, and treatment satisfaction (P>0.05). Acute nausea and retching, delayed nausea, vomiting, and retching, functional living index-emesis, and treatment satisfaction were effectively improved in the acupressure and joint groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ginger with P6 acupressure may contribute to improving CINV in patients undergoing chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Background. Constipation is a common distressing problem in patients with schizophrenia that can cause complications and impair quality of life. Objective. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of applying auricular acupressure (AA) treatment in improving constipation in patients with schizophrenia. Methods. A crossover randomized controlled trial design was performed from April 2022 to December 2023 at four psychiatric rehabilitation care centers. A total of 23 patients with schizophrenia received an AA intervention or usual care according to the designated treatment sequences. Measurements comprised subjective assessment of constipation by the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM) questionnaire, an objective assessment of the stool pattern rated by a Bristol stool form scale, and heart rate variability. A generalized estimating equation model was used for data analyses. Results. After completing an 8-week AA intervention stimulating the Shenmen, San Jiao, Large intestine and Rectum, the AA group exhibited lower scores in the PAC-SYM total score (difference = -12.66, ,0.001), and the subscales: abdominal (difference = -3.36, p < .001), rectal (difference = -3.51, p < .001), and stool (difference = -5.79, p < .001), compared to those receiving usual care. The cases of constipation indicated by type 1 and type 2 of the BSF scale significantly decreased after the 8-week AA intervention. Moreover, the AA group displayed more parasympathetic dominance compared to the usual care group, with a low frequency to high frequency ratio of -1.15. Conclusion. AA is an effective non-pharmacological method for improving subjective constipation symptoms and objective stool pattern in patients with schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the efficacy of auricular acupressure on lung function, sleep quality and quality of life in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. BACKGROUND: Auricular acupressure has been increasingly used in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, such as lung function and sleep quality, but the efficacy has not yet been unified. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials comparing auricular acupressure intervention with non-auricular acupressure intervention in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients were included. We searched English databases and Chinese databases from the inception to 26 December 2022. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The PRISMA statement was used to report a meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 12 randomised controlled trials with 987 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients were included. The meta-analysis showed that auricular acupressure had significant differences in improving lung function, including FEV1 (MD = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.37, p < .0001), FVC (MD = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.34, p < .0001) and FEV1/FVC (MD = 4.70, 95% CI: 3.63 to 5.78, p < .0001). There was also a positive effect on sleep quality (MD = -0.71, 95% CI: -0.89 to -0.53, p < .0001) and quality of life (MD = -3.20, 95% CI: -3.92 to -2.49, p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated auricular acupressure had a positive efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients to improve lung function, sleep quality and quality of life, but these results should be treated with caution due to the low quality of included studies. Future researchers need to conduct more high-quality randomised controlled trials to provide a solid basis to demonstrate the efficacy of auricular acupressure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. RELEVANT TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Auricular acupressure has the advantages of being non-invasive, convenient and without significant side effects. This review suggested auricular acupressure could be considered a non-pharmacological intervention for patients. Clinical nurses can teach chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients to perform auricular acupressure to help self-manage complications.

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Labor pain is considered one of the most well-known types of severe pain. For this reason, non-pharmacological methods employed for managing labor pain are necessary to help pregnant women cope with labor pain and increase their childbirth comfort. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cold and warm acupressure applied to the LI4 acupressure point on childbirth comfort in primiparous women during labor. DESIGN: This study was designed as a randomized controlled experimental trial. SETTING: The study was conducted between August 2020 and March 2021 at 2 hospitals in northern Turkey offering similar maternity services. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 129 healthy pregnant women: 44 in the warm acupressure group, 44 in the cold acupressure group and 41 in the control group. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. The researcher applied cold or warm acupressure pouches, respectively, on the women in the 2 experimental groups on the LI4 acupressure point for 10 minutes during the active and transition phases of labor. The application was suspended for 1 hour, and then repeated 3 more times. No acupressure was administered in the control group. OUTCOME MEASURES: The Personal Information Form (PIF), Labor Monitoring Form (LMF), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Childbirth Comfort Questionnaire (CCQ) were used to gather study data. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between both the intergroup and intra-group pain scores in the experimental and control groups (P < .05) and childbirth comfort scores in the experimental and control groups in terms of groups and timing (P < .05). CONCLUSION: In this study, both warm and cold acupressure were found to alleviate labor pain. The warm acupressure, in particular, had a more positive effect on childbirth comfort. Thus, warm and cold acupressure can be recommended to relieve labor pain and increase childbirth comfort.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The increasing worldwide mental health crisis, notably anxiety, emphasizes the urgency for available and effective interventions. Traditional therapies, although beneficial, pose limitations due to their considerable costs and possible adverse effects, thereby inviting alternative treatments such as auricular acupressure (AA). This non-pharmacological, integrative method, underpinned by Eastern and Western medical principles, presents a significant prospect for managing anxiety. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the existing evidence on the efficacy of AA in reducing anxiety, as elucidated through a systematic review. METHODS: A comprehensive search of randomized controlled trials was conducted across various databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), Wan Fang, and Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP). Two reviewers retrieved the pertinent studies and assessed their methodological quality. A meta-analysis was then conducted, incorporating data from all relevant time points. RESULTS: Upon examining 25 studies encompassing 1,909 participants, it was discerned that AA significantly diminished anxiety (SMD = -1.1074; 95% confidence interval, -1.348 to -0.801; z = 7.70, p &lt; 0.01). Subgroup analyses indicated that neither an increased number of auricular points nor extended intervention augmented effects. Larger effect sizes were associated with probing and avoidance of sham acupressure. Notably, 23 of the 25 studies exhibited some bias, suggesting further research is necessary. CONCLUSIONS: The extant evidence advocates for AA as an effective supplementary intervention that reduces patient anxiety. The results hint at a potential placebo effect elicited by sham acupressure, necessitating rigorous control group definitions in future inquiries. The study findings suggest that fewer acupressure points and shorter intervention durations could effectively alleviate anxiety symptoms. Nonetheless, the significant heterogeneity across the studies underscores the requirement for more stringent research methodologies to substantiate these conclusions. UNLABELLED: <title>Hintergrund</title>Die weltweit zunehmende Krise der psychischen Gesundheit, vor allem von Angstzuständen, zeigt, dass dringend verfügbare und wirksame Interventionen erforderlich sind. Herkömmliche Therapien sind zwar hilfreich, werden aber durch ihre hohen Kosten und möglichen unerwünschten Wirkungen eingeschränkt, so dass alternative Behandlungen wie die Ohrakupressur gefragt sind. Diese nicht-pharmakologische, integrative Methode, die sich auf östliche und westliche medizinische Prinzipien stützt, stellt eine bedeutsame Perspektive für die Behandlung von Angstzuständen dar.<title>Ziel</title>Ziel dieser Studie ist es, die vorhandenen Evidenzen für die Wirksamkeit der Ohrakupressur (auricular acupressure, AA) zur Verringerung von Angstzuständen, die in einer systematischen Übersichtsarbeit ermittelt wurden, zu bewerten.<title>Methoden</title>Es wurde eine umfassende Suche nach randomisierten kontrollierten Studien in verschiedenen Datenbanken durchgeführt: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), Wan Fang und Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP).

Hervorzuheben ist, dass 23 der 25 Studien eine gewisse Verzerrung aufwiesen, weshalb weitere Untersuchungen erforderlich sind.<title>Schlussfolgerungen</title>Die vorhandene Evidenzlage stützt die Ohrakupressur (AA) als wirksame unterstützende Intervention, die die Angst der Patienten verringert. Die Ergebnisse deuten auf einen potenziellen Placeboeffekt durch Scheinakupressur hin, so dass in künftigen Untersuchungen strenge Kontrollgruppendefinitionen erforderlich sind. Die Studienergebnisse sprechen dafür, dass eine geringere Anzahl von Akupressurpunkten und kürzere Interventionszeiten die Angstsymptome wirksam lindern können. Die starke Heterogenität der Studien zeigt allerdings, dass strengere wissenschaftliche Methoden erforderlich sind, um diese Schlussfolgerungen zu untermauern.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Auricular acupressure influences pain reduction in patients with diseases. However, study results on its influence on breast pain, common among breastfeeding mothers, are insufficient. RESEARCH AIM: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of auricular acupressure on breast pain among breastfeeding mothers who also received a standard gentle hand technique. METHODS: This was a placebo-controlled study wherein auricular acupressure was provided for 4 weeks to 52 breastfeeding mothers consulting a local breastfeeding clinic. In the intervention group, auricular acupressure was applied to specific acupoints, including Shenmen, central rim, breast, and endocrine, which are related to breast pain and postpartum lactation. For the placebo control group, auricular acupressure was applied to acupoints not related to breast pain. The degree of breast pain was assessed using a numeric rating scale and a pressure algometer. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of auricular acupressure, numeric rating scale pain scores did not show a significant change. However, the pressure pain threshold for the upper left (Z = -2.202, p = .028) and upper right (t = 2.613, p = .012) areas of the right breast increased significantly in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: This study employed subjective and objective measurements to evaluate the efficacy of auricular acupressure in alleviating breast pain. The intervention shows potential as a nursing measure. Further research is required to determine the optimal intervention duration and frequency, particularly for breastfeeding parents with severe pain, and to evaluate long-term outcomes.",
