      "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a highly prevalent pathogen, reported from almost all geographical regions of the world. Current anti-T. gondii drugs are not effective enough in immunocompromised patients, encephalitis, chorioretinitis, and congenital toxoplasmosis. Therefore, the prescription of these drugs has been limited. Rose hip oil (RhO) is a natural plant compound, which shows antibacterial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities. In the current study, the anti-T. gondii and cell toxicity effects of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) loaded by RhO (RhO-SLNs) were evaluated. Emulsification sonicated-homogenization method was used to prepare SLNs. RhO-SLNs were characterized, and their anti-T. gondii and cell toxicity effects were evaluated using in vitro analyses. The particle size and the zeta potential of the nanoparticles were 152.09 nm and -15.3 mV nm, respectively. The entrapment efficiency percentage was 79.1%. In the present study, the inhibitory concentration (IC)50 against T. gondii was >1 μg/mL (p-value <.0001). The cell toxicity assay showed cytotoxicity concentration (CC)50 >10 mg/mL (p-value = .017). In addition, at least 75% of T. gondii-infected Vero cells remained alive at concentrations >10 mg/mL. The concentration of 1 mg/mL showed highest anti-Toxoplasma activity and lowest cell toxicity against the Vero cell. Our findings suggest that carrying natural plant compounds with SLNs could be considered an effective option for treatment strategies against T. gondii infections."

      "abstract": "Gamma irradiation is efficiently applied to many foods, but nevertheless there is a distinct lack of information about the changes of macro- and micronutrients (e.g., carbohydrates, lipids, organic acids, and phenolics) in dried rose hip (RH) fruits. Therefore, in this study, for the first time, the effect of gamma irradiation (10 and 25 kGy) on RH constituents is investigated. Different analytical techniques (GC-FID, HPLC-UV, HPSEC-RID, IR-FT, and SEM) are employed to examine this effect. The irradiation treatment (10 kGy) increased the glucose content by 30% and released cellobiose from RH fruits, thus revealing cellulose destruction. The extractability of total uronic acids increased from 51% (control) to 70.5% (25 kGy-irradiated), resulting in a higher pectin yield (10.8% < 12.8% < 13.4%) and molecular heterogeneity. Moreover, de-esterification was not a major effect of the irradiation-induced degradation of pectin. The sample exposure to the highest dose did not change the content of total carotenoids, β-carotene, and (un)saturated fatty acids, but it affected the tocopherols levels. Gamma rays had a negligible effect on the phenolic constituents and did not affect ORAC and HORAC antioxidant activity. In conclusion, it can be compromised that the exposition of dried RH is safe and can be successfully applied to decontaminate fruits without affecting their nutritional value and biological activity.",

      "abstract": "Although neglected as an industrial raw material, rose hip has been important for both nutritional and medical purposes for centuries. The main goal of this study was to propose a rapid and inexpensive non-thermal technique such as high voltage electrical discharge (HVED) to preserve valuable rose hip bioactive compounds, towards the development of high-quality products, including low-calorie products. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of HVED on the physicochemical properties and the microbiological safety of rose hip nectar formulations and, for comparison, on a pasteurised sample. Physicochemical analysis proved that rose hip pulp and the prepared nectars were valuable sources of polyphenols and ascorbic acid with high antioxidant activity. The HVED technique had minimal effects on the quality characteristics of the nectars under the different process conditions (50, 100 Hz; 10, 15, 20 min). In addition, the pasteurised nectar showed the greatest loss of ascorbic acid (54%) and phenolic compounds (40%). The microbiological quality of nectars was examined immediately after preparation/treatment and after 6 and 12 days of storage at 4 °C. In addition to the pasteurised sample, HVED-treated rose hip nectar prepared from microwave-blanched puree with extended shelf life had satisfactory microbiological safety after storage."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to develop nanocapsules containing ketoprofen using rose hip oil (Keto-NC) as oil core, and to evaluate their anti-inflammatory activity in acute and chronic ear edema models in mice. Physicochemical characterization, drug release, photostability and cytotoxicity assays were performed for the developed Keto-NC formulations and compared to ketoprofen-loaded nanocapsules using medium chain triglycerides as oil core (Keto-MCT-NC). Anti-inflammatory activity of orally delivered KP (Ketoprofen-free; 10 mg.kg-1) or Keto-NC (2.5; 5; 10 mg.kg-1) was assessed in mouse acute and chronic ear edema induced by croton oil (CO). Edema histological characteristics were determined by H&E stain, and redox parameters were analyzed in blood plasma and erythrocytes. Keto-MCT-NC and Keto-NC did not exhibit differences regarding physicochemical parameters, including size diameters, polydispersity index, pH, Ketoprofen content, and encapsulation efficiency. However, Keto-NC, which contains rose hip oil as lipid core, decreased drug photodegradation under UVC radiation when compared to Keto-MCT-NC. KP or Keto-NC were not cytotoxic to keratinocyte cultures and produced equal edema inhibition in the acute protocol. Conversely, in the chronic protocol, Keto-NC was more effective in reducing edema (~60-70% on 7-9th days of treatment) when compared to KP (~40% on 8-9th days of treatment). This result was confirmed by histological analysis, which indicated reduction of edema and inflammatory infiltrate. A sub-therapeutic dose of Keto-NC (5 mg.kg-1) significantly reduced edema when compared to control. Finally, KP and Keto-NC exhibited similar effects on redox parameters, suggesting that the advantages associated with Ketoprofen nanoencapsulation did not involve oxidative stress pathways. The results showed that Keto-NC was more efficient than KP in reducing chronic inflammation. These data may be important for the development of strategies aiming treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases with fewer adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The successful use of rose hip for the treatment of osteoarthritis is well documented. Several randomized placebo controlled double-blind studies, as mono or combination therapy, have demonstrated treatment efficacy as well as excellent tolerability. PURPOSE: This review focuses on the molecular mechanism underlying the clinical effects of rose hip in osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: The database Medline was screened - using the search term \"Rosa canina\" or \"rose hip\" - for publications on pharmacological or mechanistic studies with relevance to OA; in addition for findings on pharmacologically active constituents as well as clinical studies. The screening results were complemented by following-up on cited literature. RESULTS: In particular, 24 pharmacological studies on Rosa canina or preparations thereof were considered relevant. Potent antioxidant radical scavenging effects are well documented for numerous rose hip constituents besides Vitamin C. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory activities include the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, reduction of NF-kB signaling, inhibition of pro-inflammatory enzymes, including COX1/2, 5-LOX and iNOS, reduction of C-reactive protein levels, reduction of chemotaxis and chemoluminescence of PMNs, and an inhibition of pro-inflammatory metalloproteases. CONCLUSION: The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of Rosa canina match its clinical action - especially considering new findings on the pharmacological disease pattern of OA. The entirety of several compounds including phenolics, terpenoids, galactolipids, carotenoids, fruit acids and fatty oils can be considered responsible for the observed pharmacological and clinical effects. Further research is needed to eludicate how and in which manner single rose hip compounds interact with their molecular pharmacological targets.",

      "abstract": "Rose hip is the fruit of the rose plant, which is widely used in food, cosmetics and as a traditional medicine. Therefore, rose hip is considered safe and has a sufficient history of consumption as food. However, few studies have reported on the safety of rose hip extracts in toxicological analyses. Thus, to evaluate the safety of rosehip polyphenol MJ (RHPMJ), an aqueous ethanol extract standardized with the trans-tiliroside content, we performed genotoxicity and 90-day repeated oral dose toxicity studies in compliance with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development-Good Laboratory Practice. RHPMJ did not induce gene mutations in reverse mutation tests of Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA strains and did not induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster lung (CHL/IU) cells. Moreover, micronucleus tests using rat bone marrow showed RHPMJ had no micronucleus-inducing potential. Finally, 90-day repeated oral dose toxicity studies (100-1000 mg/kg) in male and female rats showed no treatment-related toxicity in rats. These data indicate that the RHPMJ had no genotoxicity and a no-observed-adverse-effect level greater than 1000 mg/kg in rats.",

In vitro radical scavenging activity (DPPH method), hemolysis, and antitumor effects on breast (MCF-7) and glioma (C6) cells were conducted. Preformulation evaluations revealed that RHO is suitable to prepare the nanocapsules considering the log P determination and dissolution/swelling experiments of polymer films. The nanocapsules were prepared and presented adequate physicochemical characteristics as mean size around 250nm, polydispersity index values <0.2, zeta potential negative values and I3C encapsulation efficiency around 42%, without any influence of the oil core (RHO or MCT) on these parameters. However, the photodegradation study demonstrated that RHO nanocapsules showed less degree of I3C degradation in comparison to MCT nanocapsules. The in vitro release profile showed that both nanocapsule suspensions demonstrated an initial burst effect followed by a prolonged I3C release. In addition, the formulations were considered hemocompatibles at 10μg/mL and showed an enhanced radical scavenging activity in comparison to free I3C. Moreover, nanocapsules prepared with RHO increased about two times the antitumor effect of I3C on MCF-7 and C6 cells without significant reduction of astrocyte cell viability. In conclusion, nanocapsule formulations developed in this study might be considered promising for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are widespread chronic disorders defined as excessive fat accumulation, and are major risk factors for several chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure and fatty liver. Changes in lifestyle such as increased physical activity and a healthy diet can be crucial tools for treating obesity. Intake of rose hip, the fruit of several plants belonging to the Rosaceae family, has been shown to reduce body fat mass and prevent body weight gain. Thus, the aim of the study was to elucidate potential mechanisms through which rose hip inhibit diet-induced obesity. METHODS: C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high fat diet with (RH) or without (CTR) rose hip supplementation for three months. In vivo indirect calorimetry was monitored, as well as gene expression and protein levels of different adipose depots. RESULTS: Although no differences in energy intake were found compared to the CTR group, RH prevented body weight gain and lowered blood glucose, insulin and cholesterol levels. Indirect calorimetry showed that RH-fed mice have significantly higher EE during the dark phase, despite comparable voluntary activity. Moreover, when challenged with treadmill running, RH-fed mice exhibited higher metabolic rate. Therefore, we hypothesized that RH could stimulate the brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic capacity or may induce browning of the white adipose tissue (WAT). Compared to the CTR group, gene expression and protein levels of some brown and \"brite\" markers, together with genes able to promote brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis (such as ucp1, tbx15, bmp7, and cidea), as well as phosphorylation of AMPK, was increased in WAT (but not in BAT) of RH-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these results indicate that dietary rose hip prevents body weight gain by increasing whole body EE and inducing browning of WAT. Thus, it has potential therapeutic implication for treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders."

METHODS: A total of 34 healthy subjects, aged 35-65 years, with wrinkles on the face (crow's-feet) were subjected to a randomized and double-blinded clinical study of the effects of the rose hip powder, as compared to astaxanthin, a well-known remedy against wrinkles. During the 8-week study, half of the participants ingested the standardized rose hip product, while the other half ingested astaxanthin. Objective measurements of facial wrinkles, skin moisture, and elasticity were made by using Visioscan, Corneometer, and Cutometer at the beginning of the study, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks. Evaluation of participant satisfaction of both supplements was assessed using questionnaires. In addition, the effect of the rose hip preparation on cell longevity was measured in terms of leakage of hemoglobin through red cell membranes (hemolytic index) in blood samples kept in a blood bank for 5 weeks. Significance of all values was attained with P≤0.05. RESULTS: In the double-blinded study, the rose hip group showed statistically significant improvements in crow's-feet wrinkles (P<0.05), skin moisture (P<0.05), and elasticity (P<0.05) after 8 weeks of treatment. A similar improvement was observed for astaxanthin, with P-values 0.05, 0.001, and 0.05. Likewise, both groups expressed equal satisfaction with the results obtained in their self-assessment. The rose hip powder further resulted in increased cell longevity of erythrocyte cells during storage for 5 weeks in a blood bank. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that intake of the standardized rose hip powder (Hyben Vital(®)) improves aging-induced skin conditions. The apparent stabilizing effects of the rose hip product on cell membranes of stored erythrocyte cells observed in this study may contribute to improve the cell longevity and obstructing skin aging.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Rose hip (Rosa canina) has been used as an herbal remedy against a wide range of ailments including inflammatory disorders. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of rose hips have been evaluated in vitro and active constituents have been isolated. Rose hip contains antioxidant nutrients and an anti-inflammatory galactolipid. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease where activated cells release reactive oxygen substances. Thus it could be relevant to investigate if rose hip had an anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant effect in this situation. METHODS: In this open case-control study 20 female patients with RA and 10 female controls were given 10.5 g rose hip powder daily (Litozin®) for 28 days. Blood samples were analysed at baseline and follow-up for the capacity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and catalase and the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP). The participants kept a food diary for the first 3 days and the last 3 days of the intervention period. The RA-patients completed The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: CRP-concentrations of both patients and healthy controls did not change. Nor was any effect found on the activity of antioxidant enzymes. There was no difference in food intake at baseline, but in the last week the RA-group reduced their energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: 10.5 g Litozin® in 28 days had neither effect on clinical symptoms or laboratory measurements in patients with RA or healthy controls. This is in contrast to previous intervention studies with rose hip powder that found a reduction in the concentration of CRP. The results of the present study indicate that a daily amount of approximately 10 g rose hip powder for one month has no anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant effect.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic effects of a dietary supplement of powdered rose hip to C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Two different study protocols were used; rose hip was fed together with HFD to lean mice for 20 wk (prevention study) and to obese mice for 10 wk (intervention study). Parameters related to obesity and glucose tolerance were monitored, and livers were examined for lipids and expression of genes and proteins related to lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. A supplement of rose hip was capable of both preventing and reversing the increase in body weight and body fat mass imposed by a HFD in the C57BL/6J mouse. Oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests together with lower basal levels of insulin and glucose showed improved glucose tolerance in mice fed a supplement of rose hip compared with control mice. Hepatic lipid accumulation was reduced in mice fed rose hip compared with control, and the expression of lipogenic proteins was downregulated, whereas AMP-activated protein kinase and other proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation were unaltered. Rose hip intake lowered total plasma cholesterol as well as the low-density lipoprotein-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio via a mechanism not involving altered gene expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 or 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Taken together, these data show that a dietary supplement of rose hip prevents the development of a diabetic state in the C57BL/6J mouse and that downregulation of the hepatic lipogenic program appears to be at least one mechanism underlying the antidiabetic effect of rose hip.",

      "abstract": "A previously published systematic review and a metaanalysis have concluded that the consumption of standardized rose hip powder (Rosa canina L.) can reduce pain in osteoarthritis patients. Synovial inflammation has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and mainly to involve infiltration of the synovial membrane by macrophages. Therefore, the immunomodulatory effect of standardized rose hip powder of Rosa canina L. was investigated and active principles isolated using the Mono Mac 6 cell line as a model for human macrophages. Treatment of Mono Mac 6 cells with the residue of a crude dichloromethane extract of rose hip powder significantly and concentration dependently inhibited the lipopolysaccharide induced interleukin-6 release. Through bioassay-guided fractionation the immunomodulatory effect of the dichloromethane extract was correlated to a mixture of three triterpene acids; oleanolic acid, betulinic acid and ursolic acid (IC(50) 21 ± 6 µm). Further studies revealed that only oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, but not betulinic acid, could inhibit the lipopolysaccharide induced interleukin-6 release from Mono Mac 6 cells when tested separately. Combination of either oleanolic acid or ursolic acid with betulinic acid enhanced the immunomodulatory effect of the two triterpene acids.",

METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) according to ARA/ACR criteria were randomised to treatment with capsulated rose-hip powder 5g daily or matching placebo for 6 months at two outpatient clinics in Berlin and Copenhagen. Primary outcome variable was Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) at 6 months, secondary outcome included DAS-28, physician's global evaluation of disease activity, RAQoL, SF-12 and concomitant pain medication. RESULTS: In a total of 89 patients (90% female, mean age 56.6+11.3 years, mean disease duration 12.8+9.6 years) HAQ-DI in the rose-hip group improved by 0.105+/-0.346, whereas in the placebo group it worsened by 0.039+/-0.253 (p adjusted=0.032). In the HAQ Patient Pain Scale no significant differences were observed between both groups. In the HAQ Patient Global Scale a trend was seen favouring rose-hip (p=0.078). The DAS-28 score yielded improvement in the rose-hip group of 0.89+/-1.32 and in the placebo group of 0.34+/-1.27 (p=0.056) indicating moderate clinical relevance. The Physicians Global Scale demonstrated more improvement in the rose-hip compared to the placebo group (p=0.012). RAQoL and SF-12 physical score improved significantly in the rose-hip group compared to placebo, whereas SF-12 mental score remained unchanged. Intake of pain medication was not different between the groups. Per-protocol analysis confirmed these results. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that patients with RA may benefit from additional treatment with rose hip powder.",

METHODS: Ninety-four patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial. Forty-seven patients were given 5 g of the herbal remedy daily for a period of 3 months and the remaining patients were given a similar amount of placebo. The group initially treated with placebo was then changed to rose-hip and vice versa for another 3-month period. Upon inclusion and after 3 weeks and 3 months of each treatment period, pain, stiffness, disability, and global severity of the disease were scored on a Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) questionnaire. After 3 weeks of treatment, patients, if possible, were allowed to reduce their consumption of 'rescue medication'. Data were analysed on the basis of intention to treat. RESULTS: Rose-hip resulted in a significant reduction in WOMAC pain (p<0.014) as compared to placebo, when testing after 3 weeks of treatment. The consumption of 'rescue medication' significantly declined as a result of active treatment (p<0.027). WOMAC disability, stiffness, and global assessment of severity of the disease were not altered by 3 weeks but decreased significantly (p<0.018, p<0.038, and p<0.035, respectively) after 3 months of treatment. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that the present herbal remedy can alleviate symptoms of osteoarthritis and reduce the consumption of 'rescue medication'.",
