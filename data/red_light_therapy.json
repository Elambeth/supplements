      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Low-Level Red Light(LLRL) therapy for improving amblyopia and controlling myopia in children aged 4-8 years with myopic amblyopia. METHODS: A prospective clinical trial with 66 children, conducted from September 2023 to May 2024, included those with Spherical Equivalent Refraction (SER = sphere power + ½ cylinder power) ≤ -0.50 D and astigmatism ≤ 2.50 D, excluding pathological myopia cases. Participants were randomly assigned to Single Vision Spectacle (SVS) or LLRL groups. All wore SVS daily, while the LLRL group also received LLRL therapy (2.0±0.5 mW, 650±10 nm) twice daily. The main outcomes included Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) and myopia progression, assessed by Axial Length(AL) and SER at the 1st, 3rd, and 6th months. RESULTS: At the six-month follow-up, both groups showed improved BCVA. The LLRL group's BCVA improved from 0.30 (0.20,0.40) to 0.10 (0.00, 0.30), while the SVS group improved from 0.40 (0.30, 0.40) to 0.30 (0.10, 0.40). Regarding myopia progression, there was no significant change in AL and SER in the LLRL group, while in the SVS group, AL increased from 24.01±0.70 mm to 24.21±0.67 mm, and SER changed from -2.75 (-4.50, -1.75) D to -3.75 (-5.25, -2.00) D. Changes in AL and SER at 1, 3, and 6 months were significantly lower in the LLRL group compared to the SVS group. CONCLUSIONS: LLRL and optical correction both treat myopic amblyopia in young children. LLRL accelerates visual acuity improvement and effectively retards axial elongation, better controlling myopia progression compared to optical correction alone."

      "abstract": "With the rapid global rise of myopia, glaucoma, AMD, and dry eye disease, red light therapy (RLT) is quickly emerging as a non-invasive, breakthrough approach with extraordinary potential to transform eye health management. Originally applied for wound healing and pain relief, RLT has shown remarkable, multi-faceted effects in ophthalmology: slowing myopia progression, protecting retinal cells in glaucoma, reducing inflammation in AMD, and relieving symptoms of dry eye disease. However, alongside the surge in research interest, questions regarding optimal dosing, safety, and standardization remain pressing. This review summarizes the latest advances of RLT in eye health, explores its mechanisms of action, analyzes safety concerns in clinical applications, and discusses its synergistic potential with existing treatment methods as well as the integration of RLT with artificial intelligence and wearable technologies. In the future, RLT is expected to play a significant role in the management of chronic ocular diseases, but its long-term effects and safety need careful evaluation, with challenges also remaining in regulatory policies and clinical standardization."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Myopia is a refractive error where distant objects are not clearly seen and appear blurred. Goal of this study was to evaluate long-term effectiveness of Repeated Low-Level Red Light (RLRL) therapy for children with myopia, which primarily focused on Axial length (AL) and Spherical Equivalent Refraction (SER) as primary endpoints. METHODS: The research compared outcomes between RLRL treatment with Single Vision Spectacles (SVS) for childhood myopia management. We performed a systematic literature search in the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases using \"Myopia\" and \" Repeated Low-Level Red Light \". Mean differences (MD) were estimated and the effects of therapies measured. Publication bias and heterogeneity analysis were carried out by Inverted Precision Effect Test-Precision Effect Estimate Standard Error (PET-PEESE) (and subsequent Search Sequential Analysis) and Tau test. Bayesian meta-analysis was performed using Jaffrey Amazing Statistical Package (JASP). RESULTS: This meta-analysis comprised 1,714 participants: 824 in RLRL and 890 in SVS group. Pooled effect size for AL reduction was 0.953 ± 0.294, (95% credible interval (CI) 0.775 to 0.980). Pooled effect size for SER reduction was 1.521 ± 0.662 (95% CI 0.102 to 2.736). PET-PEESE analysis revealed no significant publication bias (p-value 0.407). Random effects models were employed for presence of significant heterogeneity (3.9 and 5.7 for AL; 5.7 for SER), alongside degree of variation (0.828 & 1.665) for Tau (τ), which estimates the between-study variance. CONCLUSION: Long-term observations indicate that RLRL treatment significantly influences myopia management, leading to considerable reductions in both AL and SER. Additional research is essential to investigate potential long-term rebound effects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal myopia control measures for children with intermittent exotropia (IXT) have yet to be determined. This study evaluates the impact of Repeated low-level red-light therapy (RLRL) on myopia control in this population. METHODS: This retrospective study included 94 participants divided into three groups: Myopic children without strabismus receiving RLRL treatment (RLRL Group).Children with IXT and myopia undergoing RLRL treatment (IXT with RLRL Group).ChJournal Titleildren with IXT and myopia not receiving any myopia control interventions(Control Group).Axial length (AL) and spherical equivalent refraction (SER) were measured before and after the intervention. For patients with IXT, distance and near exodeviation angles and near stereopsis were also assessed. RESULTS: Post-RLRL treatment, the IXT with RLRL Group exhibited significantly less AL elongation compared to the Control Group at various time points (P<0.001). After 6 months, the mean AL increase in the dominant eye was 0.005±0.130 mm for the IXT with RLRL Group, compared to 0.164±0.090 mm in the Control Group (difference = -0.159 mm; 95 % CI, -0.226 to -0.093 mm; P < 0.001). No significant differences were found between the two groups in changes in exodeviation angles and near stereopsis (P>0.05). Additionally, no significant differences in AL and SER control were observed between the IXT with RLRL Group and the RLRL Group (P>0.05), and treatment efficacy was similar between the two eyes. CONCLUSIONS: RLRL is effective in controlling myopia progression in children with IXT without adversely affecting strabismus parameters. Its efficacy is comparable to that observed in children without strabismus, suggesting RLRL as a viable option for myopia management in this population.",

      "abstract": "Defocus incorporated multiple segment (DIMS) lenses and repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) are used to retard myopia progression. However, it is currently unknown if there is a synergistic effect of the two interventions. In the current study, 190 school-aged children with myopia (380 eyes) were studied for the change in axial length (AL) over nearly one year of follow-up. Of 380 eyes, 170 eyes wore DIMS lenses, 80 eyes had RLRL therapy, and 130 eyes had both interventions (DIMS_RLRL) for myopia control. AL changes were calculated at each follow-up visit by subtracting the baseline measurements and normalized to yearly changes in mm. AL changes as a primary outcome were analyzed in a generalized linear mixed model to compare effect sizes of myopia control among three interventions while adjusting for age, sex, baseline axial length, and follow-up length. Participants had a mean age of 9.84 ± 2.63 years old, mean AL of 24.49 ± 1.20 mm, mean SER of -2.90 ± 2.08 diopters, and mean follow-up time of 301 ± 91 days. By the end of the study, the adjusted mean yearly axial change with combination therapy was - 0.13 mm, -0.04 mm for the eyes with RLRL alone, and 0.16 mm for the eyes with DIMS lenses alone (p < 0.0001). Combination therapy of DIMS and RLRL has significantly greater effect size in controlling myopia progression than either RLRL alone (p = 0.0009) or DIMS alone (p < 0.0001).",

On April 7, 2024, we searched through two private Facebook groups (Fig. 1) intended for patients who used scalp cooling for prevention of chemotherapy-induced hair loss. In these groups, we found several posts inquiring about the use of RLT (Fig. 2). Posts ranged from patients asking if others in the group have used RLT, if RLT is safe to use while scalp cooling, and recommendations for how long to wait to initiate RLT after chemotherapy infusions are completed. Despite the rise in popularity of RLT for the management of hair loss, to date, only two clinical trials have included patients with cancer treatment-induced hair loss, which showed higher hair counts and increased quality of life in those who used RLT [1, 2]. Furthermore, no formal recommendations from oncologists or scalp cooling companies have been made to help guide patients when considering using RLT.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In order to evaluate the effectiveness of repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy on stabilizing axial elongation and refractive changes in adolescents with mild to moderate myopia. In addition, we also examined whether RLRL therapy affects retinal blood flow density in the macular region, a factor previously unstudied in this context. METHODS: Conducted at a single clinical site, this retrospective, single-arm study followed participants over six months, with assessments at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcomes included axial length and spherical equivalent refraction (SER) changes. Secondary assessments included retinal blood flow density (superficial and deep macular layers), white-to-white corneal diameter, central corneal thickness, intraocular pressure (IOP), corneal curvature, light sensitivity, and peripheral retinal thickness. RESULTS: There were 32 enrolled participants (mean age = 11.5 ± 1.72) in the current study. The spherical equivalent (SER) remained relatively stable over the first three months, but it significantly improved at six months, changing from -2.39 ± 2.21 D at baseline to -2.01 ± 2.12 D (P < 0.05). However, the axial length also showed minimal variation across follow-up visits, indicating stable eye growth with no substantial elongation throughout the study period. Furthermore, RLRL therapy resulted in stable measurements across primary and secondary outcomes (all P > 0.05), with no significant changes over the six months. There were no obvious side effects following the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Low-energy red light therapy shows promise as a non-invasive approach for stabilizing myopia in adolescents, with no observed compromise to retinal blood flow density. Further longitudinal research is needed to validate these findings and support clinical recommendations for myopia management.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Establishing the safety profile of repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy is necessary prior to its widespread clinical implementation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42024516676) of articles across seven databases from inception through February 10, 2024, with keywords related to myopia and RLRL therapy. Pooled safety outcomes and risk-to-benefit ratios were reported, and incidence of side effects was compared with other antimyopia interventions. RESULTS: Among 689 screened articles, 20 studies (2.90 %; median duration 9 months, longest 24 months) were analysed, encompassing 2380 participants aged 3-18 years and 1436 individuals undergoing RLRL therapy. Two case reports described an identical patient with reversible decline in visual acuity and optical coherence tomography (OCT) abnormalities, completely resolved 4 months after treatment cessation. No cases of permanent vision loss were reported. Temporary afterimage was the most common ocular symptom following treatment, resolving within 6 minutes in reported studies. The number needed to harm outweighed the number needed to treat by a ratio of 12.7-21.4 for a person with -3D to -8D myopia treated with RLRL therapy. Incidence of side effects from RLRL was 0.088 per 100 patient-years (95 % confidence interval, 0.02-0.50). CONCLUSIONS: No irreversible visual function loss or ocular structural damage was identified with RLRL. Fundus photography and OCT before and during therapy, alongside home monitoring of visual acuity and duration of afterimages, are necessary to identify side effects. Further adequately powered studies of longer duration are needed to evaluate long-term safety of RLRL.",

METHODS: 278 pre-myopic (-0.50 D < spherical equivalent refraction, SER ≤ 0.50 D) participants were assigned to the RLRL group and control group randomly and evenly. The OCT, visual acuity, AL, SER and other parameters were measured before enrollment and every 3 months after intervention. The data from both eyes of the included participants were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 463 eyes were analyzed. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 176 participants in the RLRL group had treatment interrupted. The continued RLRL group, interrupted RLRL group and control group were well balanced in baseline characteristics. In the continued and interrupted RLRL group, the average ChT increased significantly at 3-month visit (all P < 0.001) and the subfoveal ChT thickened evidently. The area under the curve (AUC) for the models including gender and 3-month change in ChT to predict satisfactory myopia prevention at 12 months was 0.983. The efficacy of the models that also used the combined indicators of baseline age, gender and the 3-month change in ChT to predict AL progression control over 12 months reached 0.944. CONCLUSIONS: Continued RLRL intervention induced notable thickening of ChT in premyopic population, especially at the subfoveal sector. For participants received RLRL treatment, the 3-month change in ChT combined with other baseline factors have acceptable predictive discrimination of myopia prevention efficacy.",

METHODS: This is a single-centre, randomised, single-blind, parallel-group clinical trial. Seventy myopic children were randomly assigned to either the intervention group [receiving RLRL therapy plus single-vision spectacle (SVS)] or the control group (wearing SVS). Participants underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations following their first irradiation, 9 months continuous RLRL therapy and stop of treatment. Quantitative analyses of choroidal and retinal microcirculation were analysed via optical coherence tomography angiography. RESULTS: Over 9 months of treatment, while the RLRL treatment demonstrated significantly less increases in refractive error and axial length compared with the SVS treatment (ps < 0.05), no abnormalities in fundus structure or visual function (mfERG, VEP and microperimetry) were detected (ps > 0.05). A single red-light exposure did not exert a significant influence on choroidal thickness (ps > 0.05). Upon continuous treatment, the RLRL group achieved peak values in these circulations at 9 months (ps < 0.05). Following cessation of exposure, all circulations exhibited a declining trend, reaching similar levels in both groups (ps > 0.05). As the frequency of red-light exposures intensified, there was a consistent surge in these circulations (ps < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nine months of continuous RLRL exposure does not cause toxic side effects on retinal or optic nerve functions, and there is a time-dependent cumulative response in choroidal and retinal circulation.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare and analyze the efficacy of repeated low-level red-light therapy and orthokeratology lenses for myopia control in children. METHODS: Exactly 138 participants were enrolled in this retrospective study. Comprehensive eye examinations were performed prior to treatment. The repeated low-level red-light therapy and orthokeratology lenses groups comprised 67 and 71 patients, respectively. The age range was between 6 and 14 years, with myopia of ≤-0.50 D and astigmatism of ≤2.50 D after cycloplegia. Follow-up data were collected during the initial visit and the treatment period. Changes in axial length over a 2-year period and associated factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Over the 2-year period, the repeated low-level red-light therapy group exhibited significantly less axial length growth compared with the orthokeratology lenses group (0.17 ± 0.40 vs. 0.50 ± 0.27 mm, p<0.001). In the first year, the axial length growth in the repeated low-level red-light therapy group was significantly less than that in the orthokeratology lenses group (0.03 ± 0.22 vs. 0.28 ± 0.18 mm, p<0.001), with no significant difference observed in the second year (0.14 ± 0.29 vs. 0.21 ± 0.14 mm, p=0.06). The repeated low-level red-light therapy group showed a 55% reduction in axial length after 1 month and a 42% reduction after 1 year, compared with 4% and 3% reductions in the orthokeratology lenses group, respectively. Linear mixed-effects model analysis indicated that the annual axial length change rate in the repeated low-level red-light therapy group was 0.10 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07 to 0.14), compared with 0.25 mm in the orthokeratology lenses group (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.27), with an average difference of 0.15 mm (95% CI, -0.17 to -0.12, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated low-level red-light therapy demonstrated slightly superior efficacy in controlling myopia progression in children compared with orthokeratology lenses.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term effects of repeated low-level red light (RLRL) therapy on the axial length (AL), spherical equivalent (SE), and choroidal parameters. METHODS: Two hundred eight myopic eyes were recruited. The RLRL group included 100 eyes, whereas the control group included 108 eyes. Throughout the one-year follow-up period, changes in AL and SE were recorded for both groups. The RLRL group underwent additional choroidal imaging, and changes in choroidal thickness (CT), choroidal vascularity (CV), and choriocapillaris luminal area (CLA) were assessed before and after RLRL therapy. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, the changing trends in AL and SE differed significantly between the RLRL and control groups. In the RLRL group, AL decreased at three and six months (both P < 0.05) and returned to pretreatment values at 12 months (P = 0.453). In contrast, AL increased significantly throughout the follow-up period (three, six, and 12 months) in the control group (all P < 0.001). The SE increased significantly during the entire follow-up period in the RLRL group (all P < 0.001), whereas it decreased significantly in the control group (all P < 0.05). Regarding choroidal parameters, significant improvements were observed in CT, CV and CLA throughout the follow-up period (all P < 0.05), and changes in most choroidal parameters were significantly correlated with changes in AL and SE during the follow-up period (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, AL, SE, and most choroidal parameters showed significant correlations between changes at three and 12 months (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: RLRL therapy significantly improved choroidal blood perfusion and circulation, which may explain the observed slowing or reversal of myopia progression in the RLRL group. Thus RLRL therapy may be a novel and effective method for controlling myopia. Furthermore, the short-term effect of photobiomodulation therapy (i.e., changes at three months) can be used to predict the long-term effects (i.e., changes at 12 months). TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: In this study, RLRL therapy showed a significant control effect on the development of axial length and spherical equivalent. RLRL therapy also promoted the choroidal blood perfusion and circulation. RLRL therapy could be a novel and effective method for myopia control.",

DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, single-blind clinical trial. A total of 202 high myopic children aged 7 to 12 years with cycloplegia spherical equivalent (SE) refraction ≤-6.00 D, astigmatism less than 2.50 D, and anisometropia of 1.50 D or less were enrolled from March 2022 to December 2022. Follow-up was completed in December 2023. METHODS: Eligible participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (RLRL + single vision spectacle) or the control group (single vision spectacle). The RLRL treatment was administered every day for 3 minutes, twice a day, with an interval of at least 4 hours. The primary outcome was the change in axial length (AL) at 12 months compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes included changes in SE, changes in choroidal thickness (ChT), and changes in retinal thickness (RT) in different circle sectors. Outcomes were analyzed by means of intention-to-treat and per-protocol methods. RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment, AL and SE changes were -0.11 ± 0.25 mm and 0.18 ± 0.63 D for the RLRL group and 0.32 ± 0.09 mm and -0.80 ± 0.42 D for the control group, respectively. Axial shortening >0.05 mm was 59% in the RLRL and 0% in the control group at 12 months. ChT and RT from a single center were analyzed. In the RLRL group, ChT was thickened in all sectors at 12 months. RT was increased in parafoveal and perifoveal circles. In the control group, all sectors of ChT and only perifoveal RT were significantly thinner at 12 months. The multivariate linear regression model revealed significant correlations between changes in the ChT central foveal circle and RT perifoveal circle at 1 month and AL changes at 12 months. No fundus structure changes, afterimage exceeding 6 minutes, or best-corrected visual acuity decrease were reported. CONCLUSIONS: RLRL could effectively shorten the AL and inhibit the progression of myopia in high myopic patients with -6.00 D or worse. AL shortening is sustained over 12 months of treatment. These observed changes appeared to be associated with increases in ChT and RT.",

METHODS: This retrospective study included 108 children and adolescents. Based on the difference in the combination intervention scheme participants were divided into four groups based on the intervention they received: the RLRL+orthokeratology (OK) lens intervention group (RLRL+OK group), the RLRL+defocus distributed multi-point (DDM) lens intervention group (RLRL+DDM group), the RLRL+single-vision spectacles (SVS) intervention group (RLRL+SVS group), and a control group. Visual acuity, spherical equivalent refraction (SER), and axial length (AL) were measured before and after the intervention. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors influencing vision recovery. RESULTS: The SER and AL at baseline were statistically different (P<0.01). After the intervention, the AL increase in the RLRL+OK, RLRL+DDM, and RLRL+SVS groups was significantly better than the control group across time points (P<0.001). Changes in SER were also statistically significant in the RLRL+DDM and RLRL+SVS groups compared to the control group across time points (P<0.001). The intervention method was identified as a significant factor influencing vision recovery (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: RLRL therapy combined with optical lenses is effective in controlling myopia progression in children and adolescents."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate ocular refractive development, choroidal thickness (ChT) and changes in choroidal blood flow in form-deprived myopia (FDM) Guinea pigs treated with repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy. METHODS: Twenty-eight 3-week-old male tricolour Guinea pigs were randomised into three groups: normal controls (NC, n = 10), form-deprived (FD, n = 10) and red light treated with form-deprivation (RLFD, n = 8). Interocular refraction and axial length (AL) changes were monitored. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) measured choroidal thickness, vessel area density, vessel skeleton density and blood flow signal intensity (flux) in the choriocapillaris and medium-large vessel layers. The experimental intervention lasted 3 weeks. RESULTS: At week 3, the FD group had higher myopia and longer axial length than the NC group (all p < 0.001). The RLFD group had higher hyperopia and shorter axial length than the FD group (all p < 0.001). At week 1, the NC group had a thicker choroidal thickness than the FD group (p < 0.05). At weeks 2 and 3, the RLFD group had a thicker choroidal thickness than the FD group (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively). Additionally, the NC group had higher vessel area density, vessel skeleton density and flux in the choriocapillaris layer than the FD group at the three follow-up time points (all p < 0.05). At week 3, the vessel skeleton density and flux were higher in the RLFD group than in the FD group (all p < 0.05). Correlation analysis results showed that weekly changes in refraction and choroidal thickness were negatively correlated with changes in axial length (all p < 0.05). Choroidal thickness changes were positively correlated with alterations in the vessel area density, vessel skeleton density and flux in the choriocapillaris layer, as well as vessel skeleton density and flux changes in the medium-large vessel layers (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy retards FDM progression in Guinea pigs, potentially through increased choroidal blood flow in the choriocapillaris layer.",

METHODS: Study participants were 100 myopic children who completed two years of ortho-k treatment in a retrospective study. In the first year of ortho-k treatment (phase one), they experienced axial elongation of 0.30 mm or greater (defined as poor responders to ortho-k). Children were divided into two groups: the orthokeratology group (OK, n = 45) continued to receive ortho-k monotherapy and the combination group (OK-RLRL, n = 55) received RLRL in addition to ortho-k for the next year (phase two). Axial elongation over time between the groups was compared. RESULTS: The mean age, male-to-female ratio, axial length (AL), and axial elongation in phase one were comparable between OK and OK-RLRL groups (all P > 0.05). During phase two, significant AL shortening was observed in the OK-RLRL group compared with children in the OK group (-0.10 ± 0.16 mm vs 0.30 ± 0.19 mm, P < 0.001). Among these 55 myopic children in the OK-RLRL group, 35 (63.6%), 25 (45.4%), 11 (20%), 6 (10.9%), and 3 (5.4%) of them had AL shortening over 0.05 mm/year, 0.10 mm/year, and 0.20 mm/year, 0.3 mm/year, and 0.4 mm/year, respectively. Older baseline age (β = -0.02), higher treatment compliance (β = -0.462), and AL change at 1 month (β = 1.263) were significantly associated with less AL elongation (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For poor responders of orthokeratology, RLRL could slow axial elongation in addition to the ortho-k treatment effect. Those who respond poorly to ortho-k with elder age might benefit more from combined therapy."

DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, single-blind clinical trial (randomized controlled trial; NCT05184621). PARTICIPANTS: Between February 2021 and April 2022, 192 children aged 6 to 16 years were enrolled. Each child had at least 1 eye with myopia of cycloplegic spherical equivalent refraction (SER) at least -4.0 diopters (D), astigmatism of ≤2.0 D, anisometropia of ≤3.0 D, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.2 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution or better. Follow-up was completed by April 2023. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to intervention (RLRL treatment plus single-vision spectacles) or control (single-vision spectacles) groups. The RLRL treatment was administered for 3 minutes per session, twice daily with a minimum interval of 4 hours, 7 days per week. MEAN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome and key secondary outcome were changes in axial length (AL) and cycloplegic SER measured at baseline and the 12-month follow-up visit. Participants who had at least 1 postrandomization follow-up visit were analyzed for treatment efficacy. RESULTS: Among 192 randomized participants, 188 (97.91%) were included in the analyses (96 in the RLRL group and 92 in the control group). After 12 months, the adjusted mean change in AL was -0.06 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.10 to -0.02 mm) and 0.34 mm (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.39 mm) in the intervention and control groups, respectively. A total of 48 participants (53.3%) in the intervention group were still experiencing axial shortening >0.05 mm at the 12-month follow-up. The mean SER change after 12 months was 0.11 D (95% CI, 0.02to 0.19 D) and -0.75 D (95% CI, -0.88 to -0.62 D) in the intervention and control groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated low-level red light demonstrates stronger treatment efficacy among those with high myopia, with 53.3% experiencing substantial axial shortening. Repeated low-level red light provides an excellent solution for the management of high myopia progression, a significant challenge in ophthalmology practice.

DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, single-blind clinical trial (ClinicaTrials.gov identifier, NCT04722874). PARTICIPANTS: Eligible children were 8-13 years of age with a cycloplegic spherical equivalent refraction of -1.00 to -5.00 diopters at the initial orthokeratology fitting examination and had annual axial length (AL) elongation of ≥0.50 mm despite undergoing orthokeratology. Forty-eight children were enrolled from March 2021 through January 2022, and the final follow-up was completed in March 2023. METHODS: Children were assigned randomly to the RLRL therapy combined with orthokeratology (RCO) group or to the orthokeratology group in a 2:1 ratio. The orthokeratology group wore orthokeratology lenses for at least 8 hours per night, whereas the RCO group received daily RLRL therapy twice daily for 3 minutes in addition to orthokeratology. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was AL change measured at 12 months relative to baseline. The primary analysis was conducted in children who received the assigned intervention and completed at least 1 follow-up after randomization using the modified intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Forty-seven children (97.9%) were included in the analysis (30 in the RCO group and 17 in the orthokeratology group). The mean axial elongation rate before the trial was 0.60 mm/year and 0.61 mm/year in the RCO and orthokeratology groups, respectively. After 12 months, the adjusted mean AL changes were -0.02 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.08 to +0.03 mm) in the RCO group and 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19-0.34 mm) in the orthokeratology group. The adjusted mean difference in AL change was -0.29 mm (95% CI, -0.44 to -0.14 mm) between the groups. The percentage of children achieving an uncorrected visual acuity of more than 20/25 was similar in the RCO (64.3%) and orthokeratology (65.5%) groups (P = 0.937). CONCLUSIONS: Combining RLRL therapy with orthokeratology may offer a promising approach to optimize axial elongation control among children with myopia. This approach also potentially allows children to achieve satisfactory visual acuity, reducing daytime dependence on corrective eyewear.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine how different factors influence the effectiveness of repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy in preventing and treating myopia in children. METHODS: Between June 2022 and April 2023, 336 children who visited our hospital due to myopia or significant decreases in hyperopia reserve were enrolled. The children were treated twice daily for three minutes with a head-mounted low-level red-light (single wavelength of 650 nm) therapeutic device. Each of the two treatment sessions was separated by at least four hours. The axial lengths and diopters of the children's eyes were compared before and three months after treatment, and the effects of gender, age, and baseline diopter on the efficacy of RLRL therapy were analyzed. RESULTS: Following three months of treatment, the average axial length of the eyes decreased by 0.031 mm. The condition was better for the boys than for girls, but the difference was not statistically significant. As age increased (F = 8.112, P = 0.000) or as the absolute value of baseline myopia degree increased (F = 10.51, P = 0.000), axial lengths of the eyes tended to decrease. The spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of children decreased by an average of 0.012 ± 0.355D. The condition was better for the boys than for girls, but the difference was not statistically significant. SER increased in the direction of hyperopic drift as age increased (F = 2.48, P = 0.031), or as the absolute value of baseline myopia degrees increased (F = 6.835, P = 0.000). There were no obvious side effects following the treatment. CONCLUSION: This study showed that RLRL therapy is a potential efficient, easily operable, and practically feasible method for the prevention and control of myopia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUD: To investigate the safety of repetitive low-level red-light therapy (RLRLT) in children with myopia. METHODS: Children with myopia were assigned to the RLRL and control groups. Axial length (AL) and spherical equivalent refraction (SER) were followed up at 3-, 6-, and 12-month. To evaluate the safety of RLRLT, at 6 and 12 months in the RLRL group, multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) and contrast sensitivity were recorded. Furthermore, optical coherence tomography was used to measure the relative reflectance of the ellipsoid zone (rEZR), photoreceptor outer segment (rPOSR), and retinal pigment epithelium (rRPER). RESULTS: A total of 108 children completed the trial (55 in the RLRL group and 53 in the control group). After 3, 6, and 12 months, AL was shorter and SER less myopic in the RLRL group than in the control group. Regarding the safety of the RLRLT, the response density and amplitude of the P1 wave of the first ring of the mfERG increased significantly at 6 months (P = 0.001 and P = 0.017, respectively). At 6 and 12 months, contrast sensitivity at the high spatial frequency increased. Moreover, the rEZR increased significantly at 6 months (P = 0.029), the rPOSR increased significantly at 6 and 12 months (both P < 0.001), and the increase in rPOSR was greater with greater AL regression. CONCLUSIONS: Based on retinal function and structure follow-up, RLRLT was safe within 12 months. However, rEZR and rPOSR increased, the effects of this phenomenon requires further observation.",

When it comes to treating myopia in children, LLRL therapy is recent, and its efficacy and safety still are not clear. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature for LLRL was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines on November 5, 2022. Databases, including PUBMED, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase were queried. A meta-analysis of random effects was conducted. Inclusion criteria included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) or observational studies where LLRL therapy was used in children (3‒15 years old) with myopia. Exclusion criteria were studies with other ocular abnormalities. Efficacy was evaluated through the mean change in Axial Length (AL) and cycloplegic Spherical Equivalent Error (SER), while safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse effects. RESULTS: A total of 5 final studies were included (4 RCTs, and 1 observational), in which 685 total patients were analyzed. The mean age was 9.7 ± 0.66 years, with 48,2% female patients. The number of eyes in the LRLL arm is 714 and, in the control, arm is 656. LLRL showed better results in SER and AL mean change (OR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.83; p < 0.00001, and MD -0.33; 95% CI -0.52 to -0.13; p = 0.001, respectively), in comparison to the control group. There was no significant difference in adverse effects between groups (MD = 5.76; 95% CI 0.66 to 50.14; p = 0.11). CONCLUSION: LLRL therapy is a non-invasive, effective, and safe short-term treatment option; however, long-term evaluation, particularly in comparison to other therapies, requires additional investigation.",

METHODS: This prospective study included 40 school-age children with myopia (80 eyes), aged 7-14 years, who received therapy using a LLLT instrument. At baseline and therapy for 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, all children underwent comprehensive ophthalmological examinations, including slit-lamp examination, uncorrected visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity, spherical equivalent degree, axial length, and OCTA. The vessel densities of the superficial retinal capillary plexus, macular inner retinal thickness, and full-layer retinal thickness were measured. RESULTS: The macular inner retinal thickness increased at 1 month and remained unchanged thereafter, It differed significantly in nine areas at 1, 3, and 6 months compared to the thicknesses before therapy (P < 0.05); however, we observed no significant differences between the different time points (P > 0.05). The macular full-layer retinal thickness increased at 1 month and remained unchanged thereafter; the changes showed significant differences at 1 month and 3 months compared to before therapy, for the inner nasal region (P < 0.05). The other eight areas showed significant differences at 1, 3, and 6 months compared with before therapy (P < 0.05); however, no significant difference was observed between the different time points after therapy (P > 0.05). The vessel density of the superficial retinal capillary plexus did not differ significantly among the four groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: LLLT therapy was safe. The school-aged children exhibited macular thickening after LLLT therapy, which had no significant effect on macular microcirculation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy on the structure and vasculature of the choroid and retina in Chinese children with premyopia. METHODS: This study was a single-center randomized clinical trial. A total of 94 children with premyopia (- 0.50 D < spherical equivalent [SE] ≤  + 0.75 D) were randomly assigned to either the RLRL therapy or control group. Follow-up visits were planned at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Optical coherence biometry was used to measure axial length (AL) and anterior segment parameters. Choroidal thickness (CT), retinal thickness (RT), superficial retinal vascular density (SRVD), deep retinal vascular density (DRVD), choriocapillaris perfusion area (CCPA), and choroidal vessel volume (CVV) were measured by optical coherence tomography angiography, centered on the foveal, parafoveal (ParaF), and perifoveal (PeriF) regions. RESULTS: The thickening of the choroid was observed across the entire macular region at different time points in the RLRL therapy group. Relative to the baseline measurement, foveal CT significantly increased at the 1-month follow-up with RLRL therapy, with a mean (± standard deviation [SD]) adjusted change of 16.96 ± 19.87 μm. The greatest magnitude of foveal CT changes was observed at the 3-month visit (an increase of 19.58 ± 20.59 μm), with a slight reduction in the extent of foveal CT increase at the 6-month visit (an increase of 15.85 ± 23.77 μm). The second greatest CT increase was observed at the 9-month visit (an increase of 19.57 ± 35.51 μm), after which the extent of CT increase gradually decreased until the end of the study at the 12-month visit (an increase of 11.99 ± 32.66 μm). We also observed a significant increase in CT in the ParaF and PeriF areas in the RLRL group over 12 months. In contrast, CT across the entire macular region in the control group significantly decreased throughout the follow-up visits (all P < 0.05). Regarding the vascular parameters of the choroid, significant increases in CVV were observed primarily in the ParaF and PeriF regions of the choroid in the RLRL group. In comparison, the control group exhibited decreases in CVV throughout the entire area. Furthermore, notable elevations in CCPA were detected in the PeriF area of the choroid in the RLRL group during the 1-month (an increase of 0.40 mm2), 3-month (an increase of 0.25 mm2), and 12-month visits (an increase of 0.42 mm2) (all P < 0.05). In addition, no notable differences were observed between the groups regarding foveal RT and retinal vascular parameters throughout the 12 months (P > 0.05). Notably, RLRL therapy achieved a notable reduction in SE shift by 73.8%, a substantial decrease in AL change by 67.9%, and a significant reduction in myopia incidence by 45.1% within 1 year. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a significant increase in CT and flow in the RLRL-treated eyes throughout the 12-months of the study. Combined with its reduction in spherical equivalent progression and axial elongation, RLRL could be used as an effective therapy for preventing progression in premyopes.

METHODS: We searched several databases including PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, WANFANG, CBM, and VIP with languages restricted to both Chinese and English. The search was conducted from the establishment of the databases to March 23, 2023. We collected randomized controlled trials and controlled experiments to evaluate changes in axial length (AL) and spherical equivalent (SE) before and after RLRL intervention. Two researchers performed literature screening and data extraction, and RevMan software (Ver 5.3) and StataMP 17.0 were used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 141 articles were retrieved, and finally, six randomized controlled trials met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including 820 eyes (RLRL group: 411 eyes, control group: 409 eyes). The meta-analysis results showed that the RLRL group was significantly better than the control group in controlling AL, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (mean difference [MD] = -0.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] [ - 0.28, -0.16]; P < 0.001). The RLRL group was also better than the control group in terms of SE, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (MD = 0.46, 95% CI [0.32, 0.6]; P < 0.001). Five studies reported adverse reactions in the RLRL group, and two cases stopped treatment due to the feeling of too bright light, while the others had no significant side effects in the short term. CONCLUSION: RLRL therapy is a safe and effective method for controlling myopia, which can inhibit the growth of AL and slow down the progression of myopia. However, further research and validation are needed to determine its treatment efficacy and course.",

This article provides an evidence-based review of the safety and myopia control efficacy of red light and discusses the potential mechanisms by which red light may work to slow childhood myopia progression.The spectral composition of the ambient light in the visual environment has powerful effects on eye growth and refractive development. Studies in mammalian and primate animal models (macaque monkeys and tree shrews) have shown that daily exposure to long-wavelength (red or amber) light promotes slower eye growth and hyperopia development and inhibits myopia induced by form deprivation or minus lens wear. Consistent with these results, several recent randomized controlled clinical trials in Chinese children have demonstrated that exposure to red light for 3 minutes twice a day significantly reduces myopia progression and axial elongation. These findings have collectively provided strong evidence for the potential of using red light as a myopia control intervention in clinical practice. However, several questions remain unanswered. In this article, we review the current evidence on the safety and efficacy of red light as a myopia control intervention, describe potential mechanisms, and discuss some key unresolved issues that require consideration before red light can be broadly translated into myopia control in children.",

METHODS: Three STL children, aged 3, 7, and 11y, received RLRL therapy throughout the follow-up period of 17, 3, and 6mo, respectively after exclusion of fundus anomalies. Data on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure, cycloplegic subjective refraction, ocular biometrics, scanning laser ophthalmoscope, optical coherence tomography, genetic testing, systemic disease history, and family history were recorded. RESULTS: At the initiation of the RLRL therapy, the spherical equivalent (SE) of 6 eyes from 3 patients ranged from -3.75 to -20.38 D, axial length (AL) were from 23.88 to 30.68 mm, and BCVA were from 0.4 to 1.0 (decimal notation). Myopia progression of all six eyes slowed down after RLRL therapy. AL in five out of the six eyes shortened -0.07 to -0.63 mm. No side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Three cases of STL whose progression of myopic shift and AL elongation are successfully reduced and even reversed after RLRL therapy."

      "abstract": "Repeated low-level red-light (RLRL), characterized by increased energy supply and cellular metabolism, thus enhancing metabolic repair processes, has gained persistent worldwide attention in recent years as a new novel scientific approach for therapeutic application in myopia. This therapeutic revolution led by RLRL therapy is due to significant advances in bioenergetics and photobiology, for instance, enormous progresses in photobiomodulation regulated by cytochrome c oxidase, the primary photoreceptor of the light in the red to near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, as the primary mechanism of action in RLRL therapy. This oxidase is also a key mitochondrial enzyme for cellular bioenergetics, especially for the nerve cells in the retina and brain. In addition, dopamine (DA)-enhanced release of nitric oxide may also be involved in controlling myopia by activation of nitric oxide synthase, enhancing cGMP signaling. Recent evidence has also suggested that RLRL may inhibit myopia progression by inhibiting spherical equivalent refraction (SER) progression and axial elongation without adverse effects. In this review, we provide scientific evidence for RLRL therapy as a unique paradigm to control myopia and support the theory that targeting neuronal energy metabolism may constitute a major target for the neurotherapeutics of myopia, with emphasis on its molecular, cellular, and nervous tissue levels, and the potential benefits of RLRL therapy for myopia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Repeated low-level red light (RLRL) therapy has been suggested to be effective in children with myopia. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is still limited. We performed a meta-analysis of RCTs to systematically evaluate the efficacy of RLRL on changes of axial length (AL) and cycloplegic spherical equivalent refraction (SER) in children with myopia. METHODS: Relevant RCTs were obtained through a search of electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure from inception to September 15, 2022. A random-effects model was used to pool the results after incorporating the influence of potential heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the control treatment and follow-up duration. RESULTS: A total of seven RCTs involving 1,031 children with myopia, aged 6 to 16 years, were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with control treatment without RLRL, treatment with RLRL was associated with a significantly reduced AL (mean difference [MD]: -0.25 mm, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.32 to -0.17, P <0.001; I 2 =13%) and a significantly increased cycloplegic SER (MD: 0.60 D, 95% CI: 0.44-0.76, P <0.001; I 2 =20%). Further subgroup analyses showed consistent results in studies comparing children wearing single vision lenses and those receiving active treatment including orthokeratology or low-dose atropine eye drops, as well as studies of treatment duration of 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the meta-analysis suggested that RLRL treatment is effective for slowing down the progression of myopia in children aged 6 to 16 years.",

This study aims to investigate longitudinal changes in choroidal structure in myopic children following 12-month RLRL treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is a secondary analysis from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (NCT04073238). Choroidal parameters were derived from baseline and follow-up swept-source optical coherence tomography scans taken at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. These parameters included the luminal area (LA), stromal area (SA), total choroidal area (TCA; a combination of LA and SA), and choroidal vascularity index (CVI; ratio of LA to TCA), which were automatically measured by a validated custom choroidal structure assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of 143 children (88.3% of all participants) with sufficient image quality were included in the analysis (n=67 in the RLRL and n=76 in the control groups). At the 12-month visit, all choroidal parameters increased in the RLRL group, with changes from baseline of 11.70×10 3  μm 2 (95% CI: 4.14-19.26×10 3  μm 2 ), 3.92×10 3  μm 2 (95% CI: 0.56-7.27×10 3  μm 2 ), 15.61×10 3  μm 2 (95% CI: 5.02-26.20×10 3  μm 2 ), and 0.21% (95% CI: -0.09% to 0.51%) for LA, SA, TCA, and CVI, respectively, whereas these parameters reduced in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Following RLRL therapy, the choroidal thickening was found to be accompanied by increases in both the vessel LA and SA, with the increase in LA being greater than that of SA. In the control group, with myopia progression, both the LA and SA decreased over time.",

METHODS: Forty-seven myopic children (mean spherical equivalent refractive error [SE]: -2.31 ± 1.26 D; age range: 8.0-11.0 years) were enrolled and received RLRLT (power 2 mW, wavelength 650 nm) for 3 min twice a day, while 20 myopic children (SE: -2.75 ± 0.84 D; age range: 7.0-10.0 years) were included as a control group. All participants wore single-vision distance glasses. Refractive error, axial length (AL) and other biometric parameters were measured at baseline and during follow-up visits in the first, second and fourth weeks after initiation of treatment. Retinal thickness, subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), total choroidal area (TCA), luminal area (LA), stromal area (SA) and choroidal vascularity index (CVI) were obtained using optical coherence tomography (OCT). The percentage retinal vascular density (VD%) and choriocapillaris flow voids (FV%) were measured using en-face OCT angiography. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment, a significant increase in SFCT was observed in the RLRLT group, with an average increase of 14.5 μm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.6-19.5 μm), compared with a decrease of -1.7 μm (95% CI: -9.1 to 5.7 μm) in the control group (p < 0.0001). However, no significant changes in retinal thickness or VD% were observed in either group (all p > 0.05). In the OCT images from the RLRLT group, no abnormal retinal morphology related to photodamage was observed. The horizontal scans revealed an increase in TCA, LA and CVI over time (all p < 0.05), while SA and FV% remained unchanged (both p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that RLRLT can enhance choroidal blood perfusion in myopic children, demonstrating a cumulative effect over time."

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang from inception to February 8, 2023. We used the RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tools to assess the risk of bias and then used a random-effect model to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CIs. The primary outcomes were WMD in spherical equivalent refractive error (SER), WMD in axial length (AL), and WMD in subfoveal choroid thickness (SFChT). Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the sources of heterogeneity based on variation in follow-up and study design. The Egger and Begg tests were used to assess publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was used to verify the stability. RESULTS: This analysis included 13 studies (8 randomized controlled trials, 3 non-randomized controlled trials, and 2 cohort studies) involving 1857 children and adolescents. Eight studies met the meta-analysis criteria, and the WMD for myopia progression between RLRL and the control group was 0.68 diopters (D) per 6 months (95% CI = 0.38 to 0.97 D; I2 = 97.7%; P < .001) for SER change; -0.35 mm per 6 months (95% CI = -0.51 to -0.19 mm; I2 = 98.0%; P < .001) for AL elongation; and 36.04 µm per 6 months (95% CI = 19.61 to 52.48 µm; I2 = 89.6%; P < .001) for SFChT change. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis shows that RLRL therapy may be effective for delaying the progression of myopia. The evidence is low certainty, and larger and better randomized clinical trials with 2-year follow-ups are needed to improve the existing state of knowledge to inform medical guidelines more comprehensively.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Axial length (AL) elongation in myopia is considered irreversible. We aimed to systemically report unexpected AL shortening observed in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) after repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of a multicenter, single-masked RCT. Two hundred sixty-four myopic children aged 8-13 years allocated to RLRL treatment (intervention group) or a single vision spectacle (SVS, control group) were included. AL was measured using an IOL-master 500 at baseline, 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits. AL shortening was defined as AL reduction from baseline to follow-up visits at three cutoffs: > 0.05 mm, > 0.10 mm, and > 0.20 mm. Frequency of AL shortening at different cutoffs was calculated. Analysis was done with intent to treat (ITT). RESULTS: At 12-months follow up, frequency of AL shortening > 0.05 mm was 26/119 (21.85%) and 2/145 (1.38%) for the RLRL group versus the control group, respectively. The frequency was 18/119 (15.13%) versus 0/145 (0%) for AL shortening > 0.10 mm, and 7/119 (5.88%) versus 0/145 (0%), for AL shortening > 0.20 mm, respectively (p < 0.001). Mean AL shortening after 12 months (SD) was -0.156 (0.086) mm in the RLRL group and -0.06 mm in the control group. Age was significantly associated with AL shortening in the multivariable analysis. For the RLRL group that exhibited AL shortening (n = 56), choroidal thickness (ChT) thickening (0.056 mm) could only explain 28.3% of AL shortening (-0.20 mm). CONCLUSION: Nearly a quarter of children had > 0.05 mm AL shortening following 12 months of RLRL therapy, whereas AL shortening rarely occurred among controls.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and associated factors of clinically significant axial length (AL) shortening among myopic children following repeated low-level red light (RLRL) therapy. METHODS: The clinical data that were collected for the myopic children aged 3-17 years who received an RLRL therapy delivered by home-use desktop light device that emitted light at 650 nm for at least 1 year, were reviewed. The clinical data included AL, spherical equivalent refraction (SER), and visual acuity measured at baseline and follow-up. The primary outcomes were frequency of AL shortening of > 0.05 mm, > 0.10 mm, and > 0.20 mm per year, and associated factors of AL shortening per year. RESULTS: A total of 434 myopic children with at least 12 months of follow-up data were included. The mean age of participants was 9.7 (2.6) years with SER of -3.74 (2.60) diopters. There were 115 (26.50%), 76 (17.51%), and 20 (4.61%) children with AL shortening based on cutoffs of 0.05 mm/year, 0.10 mm/year, and 0.20 mm/year, respectively. In the multivariable model, AL shortening was significantly associated with older baseline age, female gender, and longer baseline AL or greater spherical equivalent refraction (all P < 0.05). Among AL shortened eyes, the mean AL difference (standard deviation, SD) was -0.142 (0.094) mm/year. Greater AL shortening was observed among children who were younger and had longer baseline AL (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: More than a quarter of children had AL shortening > 0.05 mm following RLRL therapy, and the overall mean AL change was -0.142 mm/year. Further studies should explore the mechanisms underlying AL shortening."

METHODS: In this prospective study, 25 subjects in the Shanghai Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University were included from August 2021 to September 2021. One eye was randomly selected to receive LLRLT for 3 min. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography were used to measure retinal fovea perfusion density (RFPD), retinal fovea thickness (RFT), choroidal fovea blood flow (CFBF), and choroidal fovea thickness (CFT) before LLRLT, 5 min and 1 h after LLRLT. Baseline characteristics between LLRLT and non-LLRLT eyes were compared. Changes in the retinal and choroidal parameters were analyzed by ANCOVA models. SAS software was used for data analysis. The difference was considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. RESULTS: There was no difference in baseline characteristics between LLRLT eyes and non-LLRLT eyes. The RFPD in LLRLT eyes significantly increased 5 min after LLRLT, and the increment was 1.70 ± 0.83% (p = 0.0389). The RFPD significantly decreased from 5 min to 1 h after LLRLT with a mean of -2.62 ± 0.86% decrement (p = 0.0031). The RFPD levels returned to baseline at 1 h after LLRLT (p = 0.8646). However, compared with insignificant RFPD changes in non-LLRLT eyes, there was no significant difference in RFPD changes at any sampling point. No significant changes in RFT, CFBF, and CFT were found in LLRLT eyes at each sampling point. CONCLUSION: Although 3 min of LLRLT has no effect on the choroid, it may cause a short-term transient increase in RFPD. It will provide theoretical support for the role of LLRLT in myopia control.",

DESIGN: A secondary analysis of data from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT; NCT04073238). PARTICIPANTS: Myopic children aged 8-13 years who participated in the RCT at 2 of 5 sites where mCT measurements were available. METHODS: Repeated low-level red-light therapy was delivered using a home-use desktop light device that emitted red-light at 650 nm. Choroidal thickness was measured by SS-OCT at baseline and 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Visual acuity, axial length (AL), cycloplegic spherical equivalent refraction (SER), and treatment compliance were measured. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in mCT at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months relative to baseline, and their associations with myopia control. RESULTS: A total of 120 children were included in the analysis (RLRL group: n = 60; single-vision spectacle [SVS] group: n = 60). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 2 groups. In the RLRL group, changes in mCT from baseline remained positive over 1 year, with a maximal increase of 14.755 μm at 1 month and gradually decreasing from 5.286 μm at 3 months to 1.543 μm at 6 months, finally reaching 9.089 μm at 12 months. In the SVS group, mCT thinning was observed, with changes from baseline of -1.111, -8.212, -10.190, and -10.407 μm at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Satisfactory myopia control was defined as annual progression rates of less than 0, 0.05, or 0.10 mm for AL and less than 0, 0.25, or 0.50 diopters for SER. Models that included mCT changes at 3 months alone had acceptable predictive discrimination of satisfactory myopia control over 12 months, with areas under the curve of 0.710-0.786. The predictive performance of the models did not significantly improve after adding age, gender, and baseline AL or SER. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis from a multicenter RCT found RLRL induced sustained choroidal thickening over the full course of treatment. Macular choroidal thickness changes at 3 months alone can predict 12-month myopia control efficacy with reasonable accuracy.

METHODS: The Chinese myopic children who originally completed the one-year randomised controlled trial were enrolled. Children continued RLRL-therapy were defined as RLRL-RLRL group, while those who stopped and switched to single-vision spectacle (SVS) in the second year were RLRL-SVS group. Likewise, those who continued to merely wear SVS or received additional RLRL-therapy were SVS-SVS and SVS-RLRL groups, respectively. RLRL-therapy was provided by an at-home desktop light device emitting red-light of 650 nm and was administered for 3 min at a time, twice a day and 5 days per week. Changes in axial length (AL) and cycloplegic spherical equivalence refraction (SER) were measured. RESULTS: Among the 199 children who were eligible, 138 (69.3%) children attended the examination and 114 (57.3%) were analysed (SVS-SVS: n = 41; SVS-RLRL: n = 10; RLRL-SVS: n = 52; RLRL-RLRL: n = 11). The baseline characteristics were balanced among four groups. In the second year, the mean changes in AL were 0.28 ± 0.14 mm, 0.05 ± 0.24 mm, 0.42 ± 0.20 mm and 0.12 ± 0.16 mm in SVS-SVS, SVS-RLRL, RLRL-SVS and RLRL-RLRL group, respectively (p < 0.001). The respective mean SER changes were -0.54 ± 0.39D, -0.09 ± 0.55D, -0.91 ± 0.48D, and -0.20 ± 0.56D (p < 0.001). Over the 2-year period, axial elongation and SER progression were smallest in RLRL-RLRL group (AL: 0.16 ± 0.37 mm; SER: -0.31 ± 0.79D), followed by SVS-RLRL (AL: 0.44 ± 0.37 mm; SER: -0.96 ± 0.70D), RLRL-SVS (AL: 0.50 ± 0.28 mm; SER: -1.07 ± 0.69D) and SVS-SVS group (AL: 0.64 ± 0.29 mm; SER: -1.24 ± 0.63D). No self-reported adverse events, functional or structural damages were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Continued RLRL therapy sustained promising efficacy and safety in slowing myopia progression over 2 years. A modest rebound effect was noted after treatment cessation.",

Our study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of RLRL therapy in controlling myopia progression compared to a sham device with only 10% of the original power. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 112 Chinese children aged 7 to 12 years with myopia of at least -0.50 diopter (D), astigmatism of 1.50 D or less, and anisometropia of 1.50 D or less. METHODS: Participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to the RLRL group or the sham device control group, following a schedule of 3 minutes per session, twice daily, with an interval between sessions of at least 4 hours. The RLRL therapy was provided by a desktop red-light therapy device and administered at home. The sham device was the same device but with only 10% of the original device's power. Cycloplegic refraction and axial length (AL) were measured at baseline and 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in cycloplegic spherical equivalence refraction (SER) and AL between 2 groups were compared using a generalized estimating equation (GEE). RESULTS: A total of 111 children were included in the analysis (n = 56 in the RLRL group and n = 55 in the sham device control group). The mean SER change over 6 months was 0.06 ± 0.30 D in the RLRL group and -0.11 ± 0.33 D in the sham device control group (P = 0.003), with respective mean increases in AL of 0.02 ± 0.11 mm and 0.13 ± 0.10 mm (P < 0.001). In the multivariate GEE models, children in the RLRL group showed less myopia progression and axial elongation than those in the sham device control group (SER: coefficient, 0.167 D; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.050-0.283 D; P = 0.005; AL: coefficient, -0.101 mm; 95% CI, -0.139 to -0.062 mm; P < 0.001). No treatment-related adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In myopic children, RLRL therapy with 100% power significantly reduced myopia progression over 6 months compared with those treated with a sham device of 10% original power. The RLRL treatment was well tolerated without treatment-related adverse effects.",

One hundred two children aged 6 to 13 with myopia were included in the LRL group (n = 51) and the single-focus spectacles (SFS) group (n = 51). In LRL group, subjects wore SFS and received LRL therapy provided by a laser device that emitted red-light of 635 nm and power of 0.35 ± 0.02 mW. One year after the control trial, LRL therapy was stopped for 3 months. The outcomes mainly included axial length (AL), spherical equivalent refraction (SER), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), and accommodative function. RESULTS: After 12 months of therapy, 46 children in the LRL group and 40 children in the SFS group completed the trial. AL elongation and myopic progression were 0.01 mm (95%CI: - 0.05 to 0.07 mm) and 0.05 D (95%CI: - 0 .08 to 0.19 D) in the LRL group, which were less than 0.39 mm (95%CI: 0.33 to 0.45 mm) and - 0.64 D (95%CI: - 0.78 to - 0.51 D) in the SFS group (p < 0.05). The change of SFCT in the LRL group was greater than that in the SFS group (p < 0.05). Accommodative response and positive relative accommodation in the LRL group were more negative than those in the SFS group (p < 0.05). Forty-two subjects completed the observation of LRL cessation, AL and SER increased by 0.16 mm (95%CI: 0.11 to 0.22 mm) and - 0.20 D (95%CI: - 0.26 to - 0.14 D) during the cessation (p < 0.05), and SFCT returned to baseline (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: LRL is an effective measure for preventing and controlling myopia, and it may also have the ability to improve the accommodative function. There may be a slight myopic rebound after its cessation. The effect of long-term LRL therapy needs to be further explored.

DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, single-blind clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred sixty-four eligible children 8 to 13 years of age with myopia of cycloplegic spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of -1.00 to -5.00 diopters (D), astigmatism of 2.50 D or less, anisometropia of 1.50 D or less, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.0 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution or more were enrolled in July and August 2019. Follow-up was completed in September 2020. METHODS: Children were assigned randomly to the intervention group (RLRL treatment plus single-vision spectacle [SVS]) and the control group (SVS). The RLRL treatment was provided by a desktop light therapy device that emits red light of 650-nm wavelength at an illuminance level of approximately 1600 lux and a power of 0.29 mW for a 4-mm pupil (class I classification) and was administered at home under supervision of parents for 3 minutes per session, twice daily with a minimum interval of 4 hours, 5 days per week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome and a key secondary outcome were changes in axial length and SER measured at baseline and the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits. Participants who had at least 1 postrandomization follow-up visit were analyzed for treatment efficacy based on a longitudinal mixed model. RESULTS: Among 264 randomized participants, 246 children (93.2%) were included in the analysis (117 in the RLRL group and 129 in the SVS group). Adjusted 12-month axial elongation and SER progression were 0.13 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.17mm) and -0.20 D (95% CI, -0.29 to -0.11D) for RLRL treatment and 0.38 mm (95% CI, 0.34-0.42 mm) and -0.79 D (95% CI, -0.88 to -0.69 D) for SVS treatment. The differences in axial elongation and SER progression were 0.26 mm (95% CI, 0.20-0.31 mm) and -0.59D (95% CI, -0.72 to -0.46 D) between the RLRL and SVS groups. No severe adverse events (sudden vision loss ≥2 lines or scotoma), functional visual loss indicated by BCVA, or structural damage seen on OCT scans were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated low-level red-light therapy is a promising alternative treatment for myopia control in children with good user acceptability and no documented functional or structural damage.",

However, there is no meta-analysis on the effectiveness and safety of red light therapy for acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficiency and safety of red light therapy for acne vulgaris. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were retrieved to identify related studies. The outcomes were expressed as improvement in the average percentages of inflammatory acne lesions (MPRI) and non-inflammatory acne lesions (NMPRI), as well as the improvement of acne lesions respectively after treatment. RESULTS: 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) consisting of 422 participants were included. There was no significant difference in the average number of non-inflammatory lesions (weighted mean difference (WMD = -0.527; 95% CI,-3.055~2.001; p = 0.683). Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference in the average number of inflammatory lesions (WMD =0.701; 95% CI, -0.809~2.212; p =0.363). In the subgroup analysis of the outcome changes in comedones, pustules, papules, and total lesions, it was found that red light therapy elicited no significant superiority compared with other conventional treatment methods (WMD = -1.125; 95% CI, -3.122~0.873; p = 0.270). Adverse events of the red light group were generally mild or even completely non-existent. CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference between red light therapy and traditional therapies in terms of efficacy. However, due to the heterogeneity of the researches and the lack of large sample size, the result of this study needs to be interpreted with caution.",

The present study was conducted to characterise anti-proliferation properties of four LED red light wavelengths (615, 630, 660 and 730 nm) against non-triple negative (MCF-7) and triple negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer-origin cell lines. It has been shown by MTT assay that at 24 h post-exposure time point, only LED red light with wavelength 660 nm possessed anti-proliferative effects against both cell lines with 40% reduction of cell viability. The morphology of LED 660 nm irradiated cells was found flatten with enlarged cell size, typical characteristic of cell senescent. Indications of autophagy activities following the irradiation have been provided by acridine orange staining, showing high presence of acidic vesicle organelles (AVOs). In addition, high LC3-II/LC3-I to LC3 ratio has been observed qualitatively in Western blot analysis indicating an increase number of autophagosomes formation in LED 660 nm irradiated cells compared to control cells. Electron dense bodies observed in these cells under TEM micrographs provided additional support to the above observations, leading to the conclusion that LED 660 nm irradiation promoted anti-proliferative activities through autophagy in breast cancer-origin cells. These findings have suggested that LED 660 nm might be developed and be employed as an alternative cancer treatment method in future.",

LED red light therapy is not been well established, and it is important to find out the role of this technique in the treatment of temporomandibular disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the efficacy of the LED red light in the treatment of the tempromandibular dysfunction syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty students of the College of Dentistry/University of Baghdad with myofacial pain associated with Tempromandibular Disorder volunteered to participate in this study and be evaluated during both treatment and follow-up periods. They were 40 (80%) females and 10 (20%) males. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A treated by TenDlite® Medical Device model 204 with a LED's of wavelength 660 nm (red light) and Group B given placebo (no treatment at all) by just putting the TenDlite device near the tender points without battery and turning ON the device. RESULTS: The changes in the pain value and number of the tender muscles in both groups were highly significant, only placebo group less but with no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that red LED therapy could be useful in improving patient's symptoms regarding pain, clicking, and number of tender muscles. In addition, this study showed the importance of the psychological part of treatment of those patients. This trial is registered with TCTR20190406002."

METHODS: Ninety women diagnosed with subclinical or latent HPV infection were randomized to receive topical application of low-dose recombinant IFNα-2b (1 million IU), high-dose IFNα-2b (9 million IU), or a combination of high-dose IFNα-2b and red light therapy on the cervix and vagina. All patients received treatment once daily for 4 weeks. HPV titer was measured immediately and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment to determine the rates of viral clearance and infection cure. Treatment of HPV-associated vaginitis and cervicitis was also evaluated. RESULTS: Results showed that immediately and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment, the HPV clearance rates and infection cure rates were higher in the high-dose IFN and combination groups compared to the low-dose IFN group. High-dose IFN and combination therapies were significantly effective against both low-risk and high-risk HPV infections. Although the cure rates for vaginitis and cervicitis were significantly higher in the high- compared to the low-dose IFN group, rates were even higher in the combination group compared to the high-dose IFN group. Mild adverse effects were reported by a very small subset of patients (3/30) in the combination group. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that combination of high-dose IFN and red light therapy is safe and effective against subclinical and latent HPV infections.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of systemic red light therapy on wound repair of burned patients and discuss its possible mechanisms of wound healing promotion. METHODS: 138 burned patients were randomly divided into systemic red light treatment group (n = 69) and control group (n = 69). Patients in control group received routine therapy, while those in test group were given systemic red light therapy once a day, 30 minutes at a time until the wounds were recovered. The clinical findings and variables indicating wound repair were assessed on the 7th, 10th, 14th day, 21st day post-burn and the day when the wounds were healed. RESULTS: Mean time of wound recovery were 19.86 +/- 2.43 days and 21.02 +/- 2.97 days respectively of those deep-thickness wounds in test group and control group, with statistically significance (P < 0.05). For the severity of the pain, VAS during time of dressing change on the 10th, 14th day post burn was lower in test group than that in control group which indicated less painful in test group (P < 0.05), suggesting pain relief effect of systemic red light therapy. CONCLUSION: Systemic red light therapy was effective to promote wound healing of deep-thickness burn wounds and other similar acute wounds. Simultaneously, it is efficacious in pain relief and safe for those patients.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin is well recognized for its role as a potent antioxidant and is directly implicated in the free radical theory of aging [1] [Reiter RJ, Pablos MI, Agapito TT, Guerrero JM. Melatonin in the context of the free radical theory of aging. Ann N Y Acad Sci 1996;786:362-78]. Moreover, melatonin has been shown to retard age-related increases in lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage [2] [Okatani Y, Wakatsuki A, Reiter RJ. Melatonin protects hepatic mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in senescence-accelerated mice. J Pineal Res 2002;32:143-8] and to act directly upon the immune system [3] [Poon AM, Liu ZM, Pang CS, Brown GM, Pang SF. Evidence for a direct action of melatonin on the immune system. Biol Signals 1994;3:107-17]. This report focuses on characterizing documented functions of melatonin in the context of red light therapy and proposes that melatonin is a potential mediator of red light's therapeutic effects, a hypothesis that is as yet untested. Red light therapy (670 nm, 4J/cm(2)) has been shown to restore glutathione redox balance upon toxicological insult and enhance both cytochrome c oxidase and energy production, all of which may be affected by melatonin. The red light treatment has also been successfully implemented in the clinical setting for its effectiveness in reducing both the number of incidences and severity of oral mucositis resulting in part from the chemotherapy and/or radiation administered prior to bone marrow transplants. Moreover, red light therapy improves wound healing and is being further tested for its ability to ameliorate toxicant-induced retinal and visual cortical neuron damage. Researchers in the growing field of light therapy may be in a position to draw from and collaborate with melatonin researchers to better characterize this alternative treatment.",

      "abstract": "In animal models of coronary restenosis, intravascular red light therapy (IRLT) using a diode laser source has been shown to reduce neointimal hyperplasia following balloon-induced injury and coronary stenting. We studied the safety and efficacy of catheter-based IRLT for preventing restenosis after coronary stenting in 22 patients with angina pectoris. IRLT was performed using a diode laser (650 nm) at an energy level of 10 megawatts delivered through a rapid exchange balloon system containing the fiberoptics. The procedure was successful in all patients, with no procedural or in-hospital complications. Two patients with recurrence of symptoms had angiography at 3 and 4.1 months respectively. Angiographic follow-up was also done after 6 months in the 20 remaining asymptomatic patients. The mean minimal lumen diameter (MLD) for the whole group at 6 months follow-up was 2.57 +/- 0.62 mm. The calculated late lumen loss was 0.49 +/- 1.12 mm with a late loss index of 0.21 +/- 0.54. Four patients (2 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic) in the series developed angiographic restenosis. Clinical events at follow-up of 10.9 +/- 3.5 months were repeat angioplasty in 2 patients for symptomatic restenosis with a 91% event free survival. These preliminary results demonstrate that IRLT after coronary artery stenting is safe and feasible; it is associated with low rates of angiographic indices of restenosis."
