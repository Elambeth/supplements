      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Only a few trials target high-school aged teens with vaping interventions, typically focusing on prevention rather than cessation, with content limited to vaping harms and refusal skills. Given the co-occurrence and increasing incidence of vaping and mental health issues in teens, both must be simultaneously addressed by vaping interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a Virtual Reality (VR) intervention for teens that targets both determinants of vaping (e.g., mood and stress) and vaping prevention and cessation skills. METHODS: Participants are 150 students attending one of two racially and ethnically diverse Boston-area high schools. Health classes are randomly assigned to VR or Control (assessment only). Students are eligible if not opted out by parent, provided assent, and did not have health issues that preclude participation. While Control classes (and ineligible students within them) have their regular classroom activity, VR classes are provided with Oculus Meta Quest 2 headsets and engage with the intervention during three class periods, once per week. Players solve a mystery with a vaping sub-plot and play a series of mini-games to teach emotional regulation, coping strategies, and building resilience. A mobile app connects to the VR game, providing a home-based experience to reinforce skills learned. VR and Control classes complete baseline and post-intervention surveys on the same schedule. Primary outcome measures include feasibility, satisfaction and engagement with game play, and vaping awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and intentions to avoid or quit vaping. Secondary outcomes include vaping quit attempts, 7-and 30-day point prevalence abstinence, motivation and self-efficacy to quit or avoid vaping, positive and negative affect, emotional regulation and coping, and motion sickness. RESULTS: Data collection began in April 2024 and concluded in June 2024. Data cleaning has been completed, and analyses are ongoing. Results are expected to be submitted for publication in August of 2025. CONCLUSIONS: Because VR is visual, auditory and tactile, it is ideal for practicing skills, facilitating memory, and increasing the likelihood of transfer to real world settings. The immersion of VR promotes engagement with the intervention, rather than external digital temptations. Our study is innovative due to the cluster randomized design, focus on both prevention and cessation, integration of mood management, and implementation among racially and ethnically diverse teens. Incorporation into school-based health curriculums allows for proactive reach. CLINICALTRIAL: Clinical Trials.gov: NCT06003439."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Electronic cigarette use (vaping) among adolescents and young adults is common. Few treatments have been tested in this population. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of varenicline for nicotine vaping cessation in youth who do not smoke tobacco regularly. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 3-group randomized clinical trial compared 12 weeks of double-blind varenicline vs placebo, each added to brief, remotely delivered behavioral counseling and compared with single-blind enhanced usual care, with monthly follow-up to 24 weeks. The trial was conducted among youth, aged 16 to 25 years, who vaped nicotine daily or near daily, did not regularly smoke tobacco, and wanted to reduce or quit vaping, in a single US state from June 2022 to May 2024. Data collection ended May 28, 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to 12 weeks of varenicline titrated to 1 mg twice daily over 7 days (standard titration), weekly counseling, and referral to text messaging vaping cessation support (This is Quitting [TIQ]) (n = 88); identical placebo, weekly counseling, and referral to TIQ (n = 87); or enhanced usual care (referral to TIQ only) (n = 86). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biochemically verified continuous vaping abstinence for the last 4 weeks of varenicline treatment vs placebo (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included bioverified continuous abstinence from weeks 9 through 24 in the varenicline and placebo groups. Additional analyses compared varenicline group and placebo group with enhanced usual care. RESULTS: Of 261 randomized participants (mean age, 21.4 years; 53% female), 254 completed the trial (97.3%). For varenicline and placebo, continuous abstinence rates were 51% vs 14% during weeks 9 through 12 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.5 [95% CI, 3.0-14.1]; P < .001) and 28% vs 7% during weeks 9 through 24 (aOR, 6.0 [95% CI, 2.1-16.9]; P < .001). Varenicline had higher continuous abstinence rates vs enhanced usual care during weeks 9 through 12 (51% vs 6%; aOR, 16.9 [95% CI, 6.2-46.3]) and during weeks 9 through 24 (28% vs 4%; aOR, 11.0 [95% CI, 3.1-38.8]). Continuous abstinence rates were not significantly different between the placebo and enhanced usual care groups. Study medication was generally well tolerated. Two varenicline participants (2%) and 1 placebo participant (1%) discontinued study medications due to adverse events. No drug-related serious adverse events occurred. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 76 (86%) in the varenicline group, 68 (79%) in the placebo group, and 68 (79%) in the enhanced usual care group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Varenicline, combined with behavioral counseling, increased vaping abstinence in youth who vape nicotine and do not regularly smoke tobacco.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tobacco and vaping use among young people is a significant public health issue in Australia. Smoking rates are higher in rural areas of Australia compared to metropolitan cities. Research is needed to understand the factors that influence rural people to experiment and commence use of these products to inform evidence-based prevention and to reduce dependence and related morbidity and mortality. The study aim was to analyse the socio-ecological enablers of smoking tobacco and vaping use in young adults (18-30 years of age) in a rural Australian context with high rates of population tobacco use and to identify factors to improve prioritisation, design and implementation of place-based prevention interventions. METHODS: The study setting was defined by three adjoining rural shires (all modified Monash 5 small rural towns) in [deidentified for peer review] Victoria, Australia. A mixed-methods approach was applied using an online quantitative descriptive survey (n = 51) and semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 7) with young adults, and semi-structured interviews with health professionals (n = 10) working in the region. Quantitative and qualitative descriptive analyses were completed to describe the influences on smoking and vaping uptake and continued use, and recommendations for prevention-focused population health intervention. RESULTS: Friends were the highest influence on smoking tobacco and vaping uptake and continued use for the survey participants. The next highest known influences on smoking tobacco and vaping uptake were classmates and sporting teammates, and the interrelationships with stress and mental health were also emphasised. The interview themes are presented in the socio-ecological frames and highlight how cultural change and policy and legislation interventions might prevent uptake. CONCLUSIONS: The findings inform place-based prevention strategies for governments and community health organisations in similar rural contexts; further population survey research is needed in this area for more accurate data to inform rural population health planning. SO WHAT?: Rural young adults smoking and vaping was most strongly influenced by friends. Prevention is needed that focuses on peer-to-peer health promotion in schools, sports clubs and workplaces, and which considers interrelationships with mental health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: E-cigarette use (i.e., vaping) is prevalent among young adults in the U.S. Studies show that young adults who vape are more likely to initiate cigarette smoking than young adults who do not vape. Despite this, little research on vaping interventions and prevention of smoking for young adults who vape exist. METHODS: A 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted by recruiting young adults ages 18-24 who reported vaping at least once per week in the past 30 days and having never smoked cigarettes at baseline. Participants will be recruited via social media ads and be randomly assigned to an intervention arm, which will be the Live Free From E-cigarettes (LIFFE) mobile-based program (n = 50), or a waitlist control arm (n = 50). The primary outcomes are biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence for nicotine vaping, vaping reduction, and smoking susceptibility. Outcomes are measured at 2-, 4-, and 8-weeks after randomization. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile-based intervention that targets smoking susceptibility while also supporting vaping cessation or vaping reduction in young adults. Findings may inform future efforts to prevent transition to cigarette smoking and vaping cessation and reduction in young adults.

      "abstract": "Vaping products contain numerous flavor chemicals that are known immunological sensitizers associated with the elicitation of immune-mediated hypersensitivity responses. Therefore, we investigated the immune response associated with sensitizing flavor chemicals in vaping liquids and focused on dendritic cell maturation as it is a crucial early cellular event of the sensitization immunological cascade. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDDCs) were used to assess induction of dendritic cell maturation upon treatment with unique flavor vaping liquids and aerosol condensates. Female BALB/c mice were exposed 2 h/day for 4 days to nicotine-free vaping aerosols containing a mixture of citral, cinnamaldehyde, dihydrocoumarin, and vanillin. In vitro experiments indicate that cinnamaldehyde and citral, but not vaping liquid solvents, dihydrocoumarin and vanillin, are capable of inducing BMDDC maturation. In vivo, we observed an increase in the expression of maturation marker MHC class II (MHCII) on conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in the lung tissue of mice exposed to flavored vaping aerosols compared with exposure controls. Maturation was specifically observed on CD11b+ cDCs and not CD103+ cDCs. No significant changes were observed for macrophages, neutrophils, B and T lymphocytes in the lung tissue, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Also, we found that regulatory T lymphocytes had decreased expression of CD25 in mice exposed to flavored vaping aerosols compared with exposure controls. These findings indicate that flavored chemicals can lead to rapid dendritic cell maturation in vitro and in vivo, representing an early cellular event related to respiratory sensitization and pulmonary disease.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Current research on vaping do not report major impact on cellular immune response. However, our findings support that flavored vaping aerosol exposure can lead to rapid modulation of dendritic cells and regulatory T lymphocytes in the lungs and extrapulmonary location. Although our findings were obtained in acute settings, they entertain the possibility that chronic exposure to vaping aerosols could progressively trigger the immunological cascade responsible for the development of serious lung diseases resembling hypersensitivity pneumonitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is a major public health problem and young adults aged 18-24 years are at high risk. Furthermore, oral nicotine products (ONPs) are growing in popularity in this population. Poly-use is widespread. New methodologies for rigorous online studies using social media have been conducted and shown to reduce nicotine use. OBJECTIVE: We report on the design and baseline evaluation of a large-scale social media-based randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of antivaping social media on young adult vaping and determinants of use. METHODS: Using the Virtual Lab social media platform, participants were recruited using an artificial intelligence chatbot and social media advertising, completed a baseline survey, and were randomized to 1 of 4 study arms. The design was to achieve specific numbers of impressions per arm over 3 survey time points. We recruited 8437 participants, stratified by vaper (n=5026) and nonvaper (n=3321) status. Questionnaire data were collected using the Qualtrics survey platform. Future analyses will examine the effects of social media content on vaping at the endline. Our data analysis describes the 2 cohort samples, examines balance across the 4 study arms on baseline variables in each of the cohorts, and evaluates the internal consistency of several multi-indicator measures of psychosocial constructs. RESULTS: Among vapers, almost three-fourths were current vapers, >40% were current smokers (using in the past 30 days), and >48% were current poly-users (using e-cigarettes and ≥1 other tobacco products). Substantial numbers of current vapers also currently use some other product, including cigars (n=1520, 30.2%), hookah (n=794, 15.8%), smokeless devices (n=462, 9.2%), and ONPs (n=578, 11.5%). The average age of participants was 21.2 (SD 2) years. Just less than 45% of participants were non-Hispanic White (n=3728, 44.7%), just less than 47% (n=3913, 46.9%) of the sample was male, more than 44% (n=3704, 44.4%) reported completing high school, and 79.3% reported meeting basic needs or better. There were no significant differences between arms and strata by any of these demographics. We calculated scale scores for depression and covariates related to nicotine use and found high alphas. Finally, participants who reported having seen antitobacco brand advertising were more likely to have higher levels of these variables and scales than participants who reported not having seen the advertisements. These results will be examined in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: Social media can be used as a platform at scale for longitudinal randomized controlled trials over extended periods, which extends previous research on short-term trials. Interventions delivered by social media can be used with large samples to evaluate social media health behavior change interventions. Future studies based on this research will evaluate the intervention and dose-response effects of social media exposure on vaping behavior and determinants.

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Pneumothorax is a medical condition characterized by the accumulation of air in the pleural cavity, leading to lung collapse. While cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor, the role of electronic cigarettes is less understood. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the outcomes of vaping-associated pneumothorax, in addition to its clinical features and management strategies, by compiling published case reports and case series. Materials and Methods: The choice to use case reports and case series was due to the limited availability of other types of studies on this emerging condition, as vaping-associated pneumothorax is relatively rare and primarily reported in isolated cases. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of six databases for case reports and case series. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by multiple reviewers. Results: Seven case reports and four case series with a total number of 16 patients were included. Most patients were young, underweight men who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. Conventional cigarette and cannabis use were commonly reported alongside vaping. The main treatment was the insertion of a chest tube, with surgical interventions reserved for severe cases. Patients who were treated non-surgically exhibited a higher recurrence rate. Additionally, specific symptoms such as chest pain radiating to the ipsilateral shoulder were associated with a higher recurrence rate. Conclusions: Clinicians should be vigilant for pneumothorax in at-risk individuals, consider targeted screening for symptomatic vapers, and prioritize early surgical intervention in recurrent cases to reduce complications. Further research is needed to understand the pathophysiology of vaping-associated spontaneous pneumothorax and optimal management strategies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of newer forms of nicotine, such as e-cigarettes, has become popular among youth, creating a growing concern about its health impact on adolescents. As the adolescent vaping epidemic persists, it is necessary to engage all public-facing healthcare professionals in prevention and reduction efforts against e-cigarette use. With pharmacists being the most accessible health care professional, they are well-suited to expand their tobacco services to include vaping. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to examine pharmacists' opinions on the potential role they may have in addressing adolescent vaping and to determine pharmacists' view on a proposed educational tool (Ph-EVER) for adolescents and parents to learn more about vaping and e-cigarette use. METHODS: Licensed and practicing pharmacists in Wisconsin were recruited via pharmacy organizations' email listservs to take part in a semi-structured interview. The interview questions covered knowledge on adolescent vaping, the role of pharmacists in addressing adolescent vaping, interactions with adolescents in their practice, and feedback on the Ph-EVER. Two study team members independently coded the interviews to generate prevalent themes and subthemes. RESULTS: In this study, 30 pharmacist participants were interviewed. From their interviews, themes that emerged included how pharmacists interact with teens, what they already know about e-cigarettes, the potential roles pharmacists may have on adolescent vaping, and feedback on the Ph-EVER. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists can be key professionals in reducing adolescent vaping; however, they lack knowledge on the topic of e-cigarettes, indicating the need for continuing education. Many pharmacists noted that they rarely see adolescents in their practice setting, making adolescents a difficult population to reach. Pharmacists were open to the idea of implementing the Ph-EVER within their pharmacy stating it achieved its intended purpose. Recommendations were made to expand this resource to social media to target the adolescent population."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess text messaging interactivity with a vaping cessation intervention among Latino young adults. METHODS: As part of a single-arm pilot study, 40 Latino young adults (ages 18-25) received Kick Vaping, a vaping cessation text messaging intervention. Kick Vaping, available in English and Spanish, was developed in partnership with a Community Advisory Board of Latino young adults and consisted of 212 text messages delivered throughout a 3-month period. Participants' text messaging interactions with Kick Vaping were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: Quantitative: During the 3-month period, participants sent a total of 713 text messages (mean = 17.8, SD = 27.6, range = 0-127). Text messaging interactivity varied among participants: Two participants (5%) did not interact with the program, 22 (55%) had a low interaction with the program (1-9 text messages), 12 (30%) had a medium interaction (10-49 text messages), 3 (7.5%) had a high interaction (50-99 text messages), and 1 (2.5%) had a very high interaction (≥100 text messages). Qualitative: Several themes were identified: (1) Reasons to quit, (2) strategies to quit, (3) benefits of quitting, (4) self-efficacy, (5) barriers to quitting, (6) extra-treatment social support, and (7) intra-treatment social support. CONCLUSION: The Kick Vaping intervention generated different levels of text messaging interactivity among Latino young adults. Participants' text messaging interactivity provides important insights into their experiences using such intervention. These insights offer practical operational strategies to address vaping cessation among Latino young adults.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), such as e-cigarettes, have surged in popularity. While long-term risks remain unclear, known dangers include nicotine addiction, E-cigarette or Vaping Use-Associated Lung Injury and potential extrapulmonary effects on the heart, immune system and neurodevelopment. Addressing ENDS addiction may require strategies akin to smoking cessation. However, evidence is lacking; there are no currently approved vaping-cessation aids. The objective of this review is to summarise the available literature addressing interventions for vaping cessation. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A librarian-assisted search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus, as well as preprints in Europe PMC, Open Science Framework, and the grey literature searches until January 2024. Six included studies used self-report methods to determine the abstinence rate, while one study used cotinine-level-verified self-reported abstinence. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examine 'rates of vaping cessation' outcomes. An intention-to-treat approach was used for data extraction, and random-effects meta-analyses models were applied. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seven RCTs were included, which studied pharmacological therapy, digital interventions and/or educational content. The primary meta-analyses demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the odds of achieving 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.01, number of participants=3244, moderate-certainty) and continuous abstinence (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.31 to 5.61, number of participants=164, low-certainty) following intervention. A non-significant increase in odds was noted at 30-day PPA (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.42, number of participants=1994, very low certainty). CONCLUSIONS: Vaping cessation interventions increase 7-day PPA rates at 1-12 months follow-up and this was consistent across prespecified subgroup analyses of the intervention type, outcome and duration of follow-up. More high-quality studies with reproducible findings are needed to enhance the certainty of the evidence and guide clinical interventions. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42022383670."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Understanding youth experiences quitting vaping is important for informing youth-focused e-cigarette cessation interventions to improve public health. This study aims to examine reasons for quitting/reducing vaping and associations with quitting outcomes. METHODS: We surveyed high school students in Connecticut in 2022 using a brief, anonymous online questionnaire assessing e-cigarette use. Adolescents (N = 756; mean age = 15.9, SD = 1.2) who reported lifetime e-cigarette use answered questions about previous experiences trying to quit or reduce vaping, including reasons for quitting/reducing and quitting outcomes. RESULTS: Among adolescents who had ever vaped, 56.8% only vaped a few times and did not continue, while 32.2% reported seriously trying to quit or reduce vaping. Common reasons for quitting/reducing vaping included concerns about health (50.2%), addiction (45.5%), and cost (42.5%). Additional reasons cited were impacting ability to play sports (30.0%), spending too much time vaping (23.2%), and resetting tolerance (21.5%). Among those who tried to quit, 40.3% reported they were successful, 39.6% reported continuing vaping, and 20.1% reported quitting vaping but using other nicotine/tobacco products (e.g., cigarettes, cigarillos, blunts, nicotine pouches). Quitting due to influence of friends was associated with success quitting (vs. still vaping or using other nicotine/tobacco products, p ≤ .02), while quitting due to punishment (e.g., suspension) or losing e-cigarette access temporarily (e.g., family vacation) were associated with continued vaping (p ≤ .03). DISCUSSION: Adolescents endorse many reasons for quitting or reducing vaping that may help inform e-cigarette interventions. Interventions should consider encouraging cessation of all nicotine/tobacco products while leveraging peer support strategies and minimizing punitive measures to support quitting."

      "abstract": "Legionnaires' disease (LD), caused by Legionella pneumophila, often presents with pneumonia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and confusion. Severe LD can lead to a triad of pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury (AKI), with less common complications such as liver injury. We report a case of a 32-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with LD complicated by severe rhabdomyolysis, AKI requiring hemodialysis (HD), and acute liver injury. The patient reported 6 days of gastrointestinal symptoms, reduced mobility, and minimal urine output. The patient also reported a history of vaping. Diagnostic imaging revealed pneumonia and enterocolitis, while laboratory findings included leukocytosis, hyponatremia, significantly elevated creatinine kinase (201 000 U/L), and acute transaminitis. A positive Legionella urine antigen confirmed the diagnosis. Initial treatment with azithromycin for 7 days showed partial improvement; however, clinical and laboratory deterioration necessitated a switch to levofloxacin for an additional 7 days. This case highlights rare, severe multi-organ involvement in LD, with rhabdomyolysis and AKI being particularly pronounced. The possible association between vaping and Legionella infection is explored, given the patient's history of vaping and limited prior documentation of such a link. Prompt recognition, accurate diagnosis, and escalation of therapy are critical in managing severe LD and reducing associated morbidity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite a strict vaping ban also covering purchase, use and possession, vaping has become more prevalent in Singapore. As more countries seek to regulate vaping, with no tailored services or guidelines for vaping cessation, clinicians may face additional challenges in identifying or treating vaping cases due to stigma or patients' reluctance to disclose their vaping. Few studies have explored how clinicians identify or manage vaping cases in a context where vaping is heavily regulated or stigmatised. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 12 Singapore practitioners from pharmacy, psychology, respiratory medicine, smoking cessation or youth welfare settings, all of whom had encountered vaping cases in their practice. Interviews explored how they manage vaping cases. We analysed data using inductive thematic methods. RESULTS: Patients were described as reluctant to disclose their vaping for fear of being reported to authorities, and some clinicians were unsure of their duty to report, making it challenging to identify vaping cases. Variability in usage patterns and inaccurate e-liquid labelling posed difficulties in estimating nicotine dependence, leaving practitioners to trial and error or to adapt from smoking cessation guidelines. Tailored quit support for people who vape was lacking, especially in the form of subsidised nicotine replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: Even in contexts where vaping is heavily regulated, given the rising incidence of vaping globally, it is important to record patients' vaping history as part of routine practice and to provide services to help people quit vaping without facing stigma or legal repercussions because of their vaping."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaping during pregnancy remains under researched and under reported, making appropriate prevention, health promotion and intervention difficult to design and mount. In this article we assessed the experiences and considerations of women who vape during pregnancy and/or within 2 years post-partum, in order to underpin realistic and informative health information for women and providers in face of conflicting and minimal guidance. DESIGN: 22 interviews were conducted with pregnant and post-partum women who vape(d) nicotine, cannabis, or both during pregnancy and/or after delivery. METHODS: Participants who were pregnant or postpartum were recruited via social media and interviews conducted on Zoom or by telephone, recorded and transcribed. Data were coded in NVivo 12 and analyzed using a combined deductive and inductive approach, and principles of abductive analysis were applied to the data. RESULTS: Three overarching themes related to decision making about vaping are described: women's agency in information seeking, approaches to assessing information, and ambivalence regarding vaping practices. Women looked for information on the health effects of vaping during pregnancy and made differing decisions in the context of limited research and guidance. At times, family, friends, partners, and internet resources influenced their decisions. Some women dealt with ambivalence by vaping only in private, while alone, and at home or as a convenience. The women were uniformly aware of societal judgement regarding pregnancy and substance use in general and feared being addressed by friends or strangers about vaping. CONCLUSION: In the absence of definitive research and unambiguous clinical guidance, the women felt limited in finding accurate advice, but demonstrated agency in information seeking and assessment. Nonetheless, they also recounted their ambivalence regarding their vaping decisions and practices. We created varied knowledge information products to fill this void."

      "abstract": "AIM: Electronic cigarette use (vaping) has increased rapidly among adolescents globally. Most electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) contain nicotine, which is addictive and can cause behaviour problems and mood dysregulation. We sought to assess whether an educational intervention increased knowledge about vaping-related health risks and desire to quit among high school students. We assessed whether the effects differed between in-person or online intervention. METHOD: The analysis included 332 students from four high schools in Ōtautahi Christchurch. Students were randomly assigned to an in-person or online group and completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. Risk factors for smoking and vaping were assessed with logistic regression. Schools' socio-economic status was imputed from their Equity Index rank. Intervention effects were assessed with and without demographic covariates using mixed-effect linear regression. RESULTS: Students attending schools in lower socio-economic areas and those with Māori ethnicity were at greater risk of smoking and vaping. Risk of smoking increased with year level; however, risk of vaping did not. There was significant improvement in responses to 3 out of 10 knowledge questions, and there was no evidence that post-intervention scores were affected by participant characteristics. The in-person group showed higher percentage improvements than the online group. Expressed desire to quit vaping increased from 61.7% to 68.8%; however, there was significantly greater desire to quit vaping in students from years 9 and 10 than years 11 and 12 (P=0.043). CONCLUSION: Our educational intervention improved the knowledge of high school students on vaping-related health risks and increased expressed desire to quit vaping.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify effective policies and non-policy interventions preventing youth vaping behaviour initiation and assess their effectiveness by the level of intrusiveness and subpopulations. DESIGN: This systematic rapid review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. DATA SOURCES: Searches on MEDLINE and APA-PsycINFO for studies published between January 2019 and November 2023. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Observational, intervention or mixed-method studies and quantitative systematic reviews/meta-analyses measuring the impact of interventions on youth (6-18 years) who never vaped or who had experimentally vaped. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A predesigned form was used to extract data. To classify interventions by levels of intrusiveness, we used the PLACE Research Lab Intervention Ladder Policy Analysis Framework. We applied PROGRESS-Plus (Place of residence, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Occupation,Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, and additional context-specific factors) for an equity analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. RESULTS: 20 studies were included: 45% were experiments or quasiexperiments, 85% reported data from the USA, 65% were non-policy interventions and 40% and 35% measured susceptibility and attitudes and behaviours related to vaping, respectively. Considering the level of intrusiveness, 45% of the studies provided information and 25% eliminated choices. Overall, the certainty of evidence was low. The effectiveness of interventions regarding their level of intrusiveness varied by each outcome. No clear pattern was found between the level of intrusiveness and intervention effectiveness, suggesting that overall, the studied interventions positively changed youth vaping behaviours. Some interventions had positive effects on multiple outcomes. Equity-related findings suggested that younger youth may be less responsive to the interventions. Recommendations for action are provided. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that combining multiple interventions targeting different levels of intrusiveness and outcomes may be more effective in preventing youth vaping behaviours. Also important is to tailor programmes to younger youth to better meet their needs.",

The health impacts of vaping, especially when initiated early, are a growing concern. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the correlates of early vaping initiation (EVI) and explored the sociodemographic characteristics and vaping motives influencing EVI among vapers from Arab countries. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey recruited 428regular vapers, aged 18-60 who resided in Arab countries at the time of the study. Sociodemographic and vaping motives data were collected. Stepwise logistic regression was used to examine the factors associated with EVI. RESULTS: The study findings revealed that older participants and expats have lower odds of EVI. Males and vapers from Qatar had around 4-5 times the odds of EVI as compared to females and those from Egypt, respectively. CONCLUSION: Targeted social marketing and education campaigns may benefit groups at risk of EVI, including residents of Qatar, males, and those who are strongly influenced by social media or who have friends or family members who vape. Reducing EVI is particularly important, as vaping often begins at an early age, and early intervention is vital to prevent early initiation and subsequent addiction.",

This study explores the motivations and challenges faced by young adults in quitting vaping and their perceptions of current public health messages and interventions in Singapore, which has stringent antivaping laws and active public health campaigns. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted involving in-depth interviews with 15 participants aged 18-35. Thematic analysis was performed by two independent researchers trained in qualitative methods. RESULTS: Participants identified negative health outcomes and legal risks as major motivations for quitting vaping. Challenges included nicotine addiction, psychological dependency and entrenched vaping routines. The study revealed general scepticism towards current antivaping messages, which were seen as too generic and lacking credibility. Participants recommended that public health messages be more specific, transparent and engaging, incorporating independent research and visual aids to highlight vaping risks. They also suggested regulating e-cigarette sales instead of implementing blanket bans, ensuring anonymity for those seeking help and providing comprehensive nicotine cessation support. Additionally, the use of real-life testimonials and influencers was proposed to improve message relatability and effectiveness. CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insights into the motivations and barriers of quitting vaping among young adults. Enhancing the transparency and specificity of antivaping messages, along with more tailored and supportive interventions, could increase their effectiveness and offer guidance for other Southeast Asian countries facing similar issues."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: There is limited guidance on the best ways to stop using nicotine-containing vapes (otherwise known as e-cigarettes) and ensure long-term abstinence, whilst minimising the risk of tobacco smoking and other unintended consequences. Treatments could include pharmacological interventions, behavioural interventions, or both. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a living systematic review assessing the benefits and harms of interventions to help people stop vaping compared to each other or to placebo or no intervention. To also assess how these interventions affect the use of combustible tobacco, and whether the effects vary based on participant characteristics. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases from 1 January 2004 to 24 April 2024: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; ClinicalTrials.gov (through CENTRAL); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (through CENTRAL). We also searched the references of eligible studies and abstracts from the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 2024 conference, and contacted study authors. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting people of any age using nicotine-containing vapes, regardless of tobacco smoking status. Studies had to test an intervention designed to support people to quit vaping, and plan to measure at least one of our outcomes. OUTCOMES: Critical outcomes: vaping cessation; change in combustible tobacco use at six months or longer; number of participants reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) at one week or longer. RISK OF BIAS: We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess bias in the included studies. SYNTHESIS METHODS: We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. We grouped studies by comparisons and outcomes reported, and calculated individual study and pooled effects, as appropriate. We used random-effects Mantel-Haenszel methods to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We used random-effects inverse variance methods to calculate mean differences and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. INCLUDED STUDIES: Nine RCTs, representing 5209 participants motivated to stop using nicotine-containing vapes at baseline, are included. In six studies, participants were abstinent from smoking tobacco cigarettes at baseline, although most studies included some participants who had previously smoked. Eight studies included participants aged 18 or older, three included only young adults (18 to 24 years), and one included 13- to 17-year-olds only. We judged three studies at low risk, three at high risk, and three at unclear risk of bias. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: Pharmacological interventions for quitting nicotine vaping Studies assessed combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), cytisine, and varenicline as pharmacological interventions for quitting vaping in comparison to placebo or no/minimal support (control). The point estimate for combination NRT indicated possible benefit, but the CI incorporated the possibility of no benefit and a potential benefit of control (very low-certainty evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias; RR 2.57, 95% CI 0.29 to 22.93; 1 study, 16 participants). The one study investigating cytisine did not report vaping cessation rates at six months or longer. Varenicline increased vaping cessation rates at six months, but the evidence was low certainty due to imprecision (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.68; 1 study, 140 participants). Zero participants reported SAEs in the studies of combination NRT versus no/minimal support (1 study, 508 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision) and cytisine versus placebo (1 study, 159 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). Three studies investigating varenicline measured the number of participants reporting SAEs. However, only one study reported an SAE (in the intervention arm); therefore, the effect estimate was calculated based on that single study (RR 2.60, 95% CI 0.11 to 62.16; 95 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). Behavioural interventions for quitting nicotine vaping Studies assessed reducing nicotine concentration and vaping behaviour (1 study) and text message-based interventions (3 studies) as behavioural interventions for stopping vaping in comparison to no/minimal support (control). In one study, the point estimate suggested nicotine/vaping reduction increased vaping cessation compared to minimal support at six-month follow-up, but the CI incorporated the possibility of no intervention effect and higher cessation rates in the control arm (RR 3.38, 95% CI 0.43 to 26.30; 17 participants; very low-certainty due to imprecision and risk of bias). There was low-certainty evidence (downgraded two levels due to indirectness) that text message-based interventions may have increased vaping cessation rates compared to control in 13- to 24-year-olds (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.47; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 4091 participants). The one study investigating nicotine/vaping behaviour reduction did not report on SAEs. One of the studies investigating text message-based interventions did report on SAEs; however, zero events were reported in both study arms (508 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). No studies reported change in combustible tobacco smoking at six-month follow-up or longer. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is low-certainty evidence that text message-based interventions designed to help people stop nicotine vaping may help more youth and young adults to successfully stop than no/minimal support, and low-certainty evidence that varenicline may also help people quit vaping. Data exploring the effectiveness of combination NRT, cytisine, and nicotine/vaping behaviour reduction are inconclusive due to risk of bias and imprecision. Most studies that measured SAEs reported none; however, more data are needed to draw clear conclusions. Of note, data from studies investigating these interventions for quitting smoking have not demonstrated serious concerns about SAEs. No studies assessed the change in combustible tobacco smoking, including relapse to or uptake of tobacco smoking, at six-month follow-up or longer. It is important that future studies measure this so the complete risk profile of relevant interventions can be considered. We identified 20 ongoing RCTs. Their incorporation into the evidence base and the continued identification of new studies is imperative to inform clinical and policy guidance on the best ways to stop vaping. Therefore, we will continue to update this review as a living systematic review by running searches monthly and updating the review when relevant new evidence that will strengthen or change our conclusions emerges.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of high school students in 2023. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to examine the relationships between sexual orientation, gender identity, and transgender status with e-cigarette, tobacco, and cannabis vaping. RESULTS: Bisexual, pansexual, or queer students had the highest prevalence of e-cigarette use at 16.12 %, followed by gay or lesbian students at 14.46 %. Asexual students were more likely to vape cannabis (aOR = 2.22, 95 % CI = 1.08-4.56) compared to heterosexual students. Nonbinary, genderfluid, or genderqueer students had higher odds of e-cigarette use (aOR = 2.10, 95 % CI = 1.16-3.80) compared to boys. Bisexual, pansexual, or queer students were also more likely to use e-cigarettes (aOR = 2.47, 95 % CI = 1.59-3.83) and vape cannabis (aOR = 1.87, 95 % CI = 1.17-2.98) compared to heterosexual students. Transgender or questioning students had higher odds of e-cigarette use (aOR = 2.35, 95 % CI = 1.11-5.00) and other tobacco product use (aOR = 3.51, 95 % CI = 1.38-8.96) compared to non-transgender students. CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal significant disparities in substance use behaviors among sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth compared to their heterosexual and cisgender peers. These results highlight the need for tailored prevention and intervention strategies to address the unique needs of SGM youth.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: E-cigarette, or vaping products produce an aerosol by heating nicotine, or cannabis including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), mixed with other chemicals that help make the aerosol. They are increasingly popular among teenagers and young adults, with a 2023 survey reporting that 2.13 million middle and high school students in the United States used e-cigarettes within the last 30 days. The use of e-cigarette, or vaping products could lead to an acute pulmonary inflammatory syndrome called e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). We review the challenges in diagnosing and treating EVALI, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a literature search on June 10, 2024 using the PubMed database. We searched for articles, case reports and CDC reports investigating the pathogenesis, treatment, and challenges of diagnosing EVALI during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The exact causes of EVALI are not completely understood, although it has been linked to the use of THC and vitamin E acetate. There are no specific biomarkers to diagnose EVALI and it is typically diagnosed through a process of eliminating other possible conditions. Eight studies detailed cases where pediatric patients were initially diagnosed with COVID-19 or community-acquired pneumonia, despite multiple negative COVID-19 tests, and were later found to have EVALI. CONCLUSIONS: After alerting the public about the removal of vitamin E acetate from vape liquids in 2020, there has been a decline in cases of EVALI, although they are still detected. Therefore, it is necessary to continue looking for diagnostic markers of EVALI and further investigate the toxicity of vapes and e-cigarettes to prevent the recurrence of another EVALI epidemic, especially among teenagers and young adults.",

STUDY DESIGN: This remote, randomized clinical trial tested a mHealth program and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for young adult vaping cessation. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Social media was used from 2021 to 2022 to recruit 508 young adults (aged 18-24 years) in the U.S. who exclusively and regularly (20+ days of last 30) used e-cigarettes and were interested in quitting. INTERVENTION: All were offered 2 coaching calls and needed to complete the first call for full study enrollment. Participants were randomized to one of 4 groups in the 2×2 design: mailed NRT (8 weeks versus none) and/or mHealth (yes versus no; stand-alone text program including links to videos and online content). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported 7-day point prevalence vaping abstinence at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 981 participants were eligible and randomized; 508 (52%) fully enrolled by completing the first call. Enrolled participants were 71% female, 31% non-White, and 78% vaped daily. Overall, 74% completed the 3-month survey. Overall, 83% in the mailed NRT groups and 24% in the no-mailed NRT groups self-reported NRT use. Intent-to-treat 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates (missing assumed vaping) were 41% for calls only, 43% for Calls+mHealth, 48% for Calls+NRT, and 48% for Calls+NRT+mHealth. There were no statistically significant differences for mailed NRT (versus no-mailed NRT; OR=1.3; 95% CI=0.91, 1.84; p=0.14) or mHealth (versus no mHealth; OR=1.04; 95% CI=0.73, 1.47; p=0.84). CONCLUSIONS: This quitline-delivered intervention was successful at helping young adults quit vaping, with almost half abstinent after 3 months. Higher than anticipated quit rates reduced power to identify significant group differences. Mailed NRT and mHealth did not significantly improve quit rates, in the context of an active control of a 2-call coaching program. Future research is needed to examine the independent effects of coaching calls, NRT, and mHealth in a fully-powered randomized control trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT04974580.",

To date, no research has considered day-to-day NDS, as previous research focuses on retrospective measures. METHODS: Daily data came from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Vaping Supplement; out of 1,244 YAs, we analyzed data from 150 (Mage=19 (SE=0.44); 71.2% non-Hispanic white; 57.8% male) who vaped nicotine at least once during 14 daily surveys (n=882 nicotine vaping days). The vaping-specific Hooked on Nicotine Checklist measured NDS on nicotine vaping days. Dichotomous and count measures of NDS were used at the day and aggregated to the person level. Descriptive analyses and multilevel regression models were estimated. Weights ensured generalizability and adjusted for attrition. RESULTS: Any NDS were reported on 64.5% of nicotine vaping days (average 1.93 symptoms); 43.3% of nicotine vaping days had more than 1 NDS. Results across persons (rather than days) showed any NDS on 53.8% of nicotine vaping days, and 45.4% YAs reported between 1 and 2 symptoms per vaping day; 23.3% reported 2+ symptoms on average. Multilevel models showed nontrivial variance across days and persons in NDS, and regular vaping at baseline predicted NDS. CONCLUSIONS: Vaping-specific NDS varied across days and persons for any NDS and NDS severity. Future research should consider daily NDS fluctuations, identifying factors that confer risk to inform NDS prevention and treatment among YAV. IMPLICATIONS: NDS and its severity varied across days and persons, demonstrating the utility of daily data. The results were generally similar for experiencing any NDS and for NDS severity, but there was slightly more variability across days for any NDS. Intervention and treatment strategies could utilize approaches that identify and address daily symptoms to help curb nicotine dependence. Future research and treatment efforts should also consider the immediate contexts and potential factors that explain particularly elevated NDS on a given day."

Methods: An in vitro comparison of aerosol properties in terms of respirable dose with the Glass Twin Impinger and the mass median aerodynamic diameter using the Next Generation Impactor was performed. The respirable dose delivered in a vaping drug delivery system (VDDS) puff as a function of concentration was quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with an ultraviolet detector. Results: The mass of drug contained in a single puff of 55 mL of aerosol varied between 0.94 and 1.95 µg for a refill liquid concentration range of 400 to 1600 µg/mL. The analysis of the particle size distribution shows an advantage for a VDDS in producing smaller particles compared to nebulization (1.56 ± 0.05 µm vs. 2.30 ± 0.19 µm). In total, 81 puffs are needed to reach the dose equivalent to nebulized beclomethasone dipropionate under these specific experimental conditions, which corresponds to an aerosol duration of about 4 min (i.e., four times lower than the jet nebulizer) and a patient administration time of about 45 min (i.e., three times higher than the jet nebulizer). Conclusions: The results show the potential of vaping devices as an alternative to nebulizers for the administration of beclomethasone dipropionate in an equivalent respirable dose."

Traditional cigarette smoking has been extensively studied for its role in promoting metastasis. However, the impact of e-cigarette (e-cig) on cancer metastasis is not well understood despite their increasing popularity as a supposedly safer alternative. This mini review synthesizes current literature on the effects of e-cig on cancer metastasis, focusing on the processes of dissemination, dormancy, and colonization. It also incorporates recent findings from our laboratory regarding the role of e-cig in tumor progression. E-cig exposure enhances metastatic potential through various mechanisms: it induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increasing cell migratory and invasive capabilities; promotes lymphangiogenesis, aiding tumor cell spread; and alters the pre-metastatic niche to support dormant tumor cells, enhancing their reactivation and colonization. Furthermore, e-cig induce significant epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, which regulate genes involved in metastasis. Our data suggest that e-cig upregulate histone demethylases like KDM6B in macrophages, impacting the TME and promoting metastasis. These findings underscore the need for further research to understand the long-term health implications of e-cig use and inform public health policies to reduce e-cig use.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Childhood traumatic experiences (CTE) have been identified as a robust risk factor for a range of substance use behaviours. However, little is known about their association with adolescent vaping. We explored prospective associations between CTEs and vaping among a sample of Australian adolescents. METHODS: The sample comprised 2234 adolescents (baseline Mage = 12.7 years, SD = 0.5; 49.9% female) enrolled in the Health4Life cluster randomised controlled trial. Using mixed effects logistic regression analyses, data from the baseline and 36-month assessment waves were used to examine whether CTEs (by ~ age 12) were associated with current or lifetime vaping and future intentions to vape (~ age 15). RESULTS: Adjusting for socio-demographic variables, CTE exposure at baseline was associated with higher odds of ever having vaped (odds ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.34, 2.02), and of being a current regular vape user (odds ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.11, 2.39). Experiencing CTEs was also associated with higher odds of intending to vape in the future (odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.11, 1.86). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify CTEs as a risk factor for vaping, and intentions to vape in the future, among Australian adolescents. These findings align with global research and highlight another common risk factor across various forms of substance use. CTE exposed adolescents represent a priority group who may require earlier and more targeted vaping intervention.",

As evidence of respiratory damage and other health concerns continue to emerge, educational resources for parents are critical in combating the vaping epidemic. A vaping educational tool can serve as a resource that parents of adolescents can reference to learn about e-cigarette use and how to address this topic with their families. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine parents' perspectives on the design and use of an educational infographic (Parent E-Cigarette and Vaping Educational Resource; P-EVER) to inform parents of adolescents and their families about e-cigarette use, risks, and quitting resources. METHODS: Parents who had an adolescent aged 12 to 18 years were recruited through community pharmacies in Wisconsin through recruitment fliers, emails, and word of mouth between February and June 2023. Participants reviewed the vaping educational handout in a semi-structured interview that was recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two members of the research team independently coded each transcript using NVivo software to conduct inductive thematic analysis. Bi-weekly meetings were held to refine codes, develop the master codebook, and identify prevalent themes (intercoder reliability - 0.83). RESULTS: Thirty-five parents were interviewed between February and June 2023. Four themes were identified: vaping awareness, P-EVER content and implementation, pharmacist's role, and barriers to pharmacist intervention on vaping. Participants believed the vaping educational handout was an effective resource for disseminating information to parents of adolescents. Responses highlighted the importance of providing educational resources to initiate conversations surrounding health risks to adolescents. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists played a crucial role in successfully disseminating the P-EVER education tool to parents of adolescents. Future work is required to determine effective interventions for pharmacists and adolescents to discuss the topic of vaping awareness and safety."

This study explores preferences for financial incentives in vaping cessation programs. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted among young adult current e-cigarette users aged 19-29. DCE attributes (and levels) included reward amount ($100, $300), reward schedule (consistent value, escalating value), reward procedure (gain-framed, loss-framed), vaping education modules (yes, no), text messaging support (yes, no), and cost ($30, $100). Participants were randomized into one of the four blocks, each containing four choice sets. Each choice set presented two hypothetical vaping cessation programs. Choice data (n × choice sets × alternative programs = 154 × 4 × 2 = 1,232 observations) were analyzed using generalized estimation equation models. RESULTS: Participants showed a preference for vaping cessation programs offering a higher reward amount (odds ratio [OR] = 11.5; 95% CI,7.0-19.2), gain-framed rewards for sustained abstinence (OR = 1.4; 95% CI,1.0-1.8), text messaging support (OR = 1.9; 95% CI,1.4-2.5), and a lower program cost (OR = 2.6; 95% CI,1.8-3.8). Interaction tests showed significant effects of the rewards procedure among daily e-cigarette users (adjusted OR [AOR] = 2.1; 95% CI,1.3-3.5), but not some-day users; and among those with no quit attempts in the past six months (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI,1.5-4.7), but not those with previous quit attempts. Female participants preferred text messaging support (AOR = 3.6; 95% CI,2.3-5.4), whereas male participants did not show this preference. CONCLUSION: A multifaceted vaping cessation intervention augmented with financial incentives might improve participation and engagement among young adults. Future studies should investigate how these attributes can enhance program reach and vaping abstinence outcomes in real-world settings.",

      "abstract": "Since their invention, e-cigarettes have gained significant popularity. However, they are relatively new, and researchers are still striving to understand the long-term and comprehensive effects of vaping on the body. The impact of vaping on the oral cavity, in particular, remains underexplored. This case series aims to address this gap by examining patients with a history of vaping who presented with aphthous ulcers. In this case series, we describe three adults aged 30 to 45 years who came in with the chief complaint of ulcers on the oral mucosa. All patients were regular or social vapers. Notably, their lesions resolved with little to no intervention. This observation prompts further exploration into vaping as a potential etiological factor for recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Despite a brief decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, vaping behaviors among adolescents continue to be an international public health concern because of associated health risks and harms. A thorough investigation of existing interventions preventing adolescent vaping is needed to help address this public health crisis and reduce serious and avoidable vaping-related health risks. We reviewed the literature to identify public health interventions aimed at preventing adolescent vaping and summarized their key components and outcome measures. DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review of the literature using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology searching in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and Web of Science. Two reviewers screened 589 records for relevance. Studies from any location, reported in English, and described vaping prevention interventions targeting adolescents were included. Records were excluded if they were reported in other languages, published outside the review timeframe, lacked an evaluation, focused on cessation-based interventions, or were review articles. Data extracted included intervention type, key components, and outcome measures. RESULTS: Thirty-eight included articles were identified and categorized into three intervention categories: school-based, public education/risk communication campaigns, and public policies/government regulations. Key components of the interventions included format, duration, and topics. Formats varied from single to multi-sessions. Prominent topics covered included risks and harms associated with vaping, and the most frequently reported outcome measures used were knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. CONCLUSION: Our findings summarize existing public health interventions found in the literature and insights into approaches used to address the global adolescent vaping crisis.",

PURPOSE: To estimate acceptability and engagement with Discord among treatment seeking youth and young adults and assess the benefit of adding an online social platform via Discord to TIQ. METHODS: Between February and March 2023, 527 TIQ participants (aged 13-24 years) were invited to join Discord with other TIQ users (TIQ Discord). Participants completed two online surveys, at baseline and 1-month post study enrollment. Descriptive statistics were used to describe acceptability and engagement with TIQ Discord. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and t-tests were used to compare changes in confidence in ability to quit and vaping abstinence across those who joined and engaged with TIQ Discord, compared to those receiving TIQ only. RESULTS: Among the n = 319 who were invited to TIQ Discord and provided follow-up data, 57.4 % joined. Among those who joined (n = 183), 61.7 % engaged with TIQ Discord by contributing at least one message or reaction. The mean number of contributed messages was 4.0 (median = 1, range = 1 to 51) and reactions was 0.31 (median = 0, range = 0 to 14). Engaging with TIQ Discord was positively associated with increased confidence in quitting at follow-up (p-value = 0.02), but vaping abstinence at follow-up did not differ (p-value = 0.87). DISCUSSION: Over half of participants who were invited to TIQ Discord joined - indicating high acceptability and an uptake rate that is higher than what is typically observed for online cessation communities. Engagement was positively associated with proximal outcomes, but self-selection prevents causal attribution. Pilot study results suggest acceptability of Discord for providing digital cessation support to young people in combination with a text-message cessation intervention."

T21 laws reduce self-reported cigarette smoking among 18-to-20 year olds, concentrated in males. Initial non-users who \"age-out\" of treatment are less likely to subsequently initiate self-reported smoking or vaping. Treated smokers are less likely to buy their own cigarettes and more likely to buy cigarettes in a different state. Biomarker results are mixed, and we find some evidence of a reduction in nicotine exposure but less evidence for a reduction in exposure to tobacco. Finally, we test for non-classical measurement error. T21 laws reduce the probability that clinically identified likely cigarette smokers self-report as smokers, which may increase the apparent effect of T21 laws on cigarette smoking as measured by self-reports.",

      "abstract": "E-cigarettes are thought to aid in tobacco smoking cessation, but there are concerns about their overall effectiveness and safety for the general population, particularly adults. This review aims to investigate the mechanisms of toxicity and adverse effects of e-cigarettes on the respiratory system, comparing these effects with those of conventional smoking. A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library using keywords, controlled vocabulary, and text words, with the following criteria: studies published in English from 2014 to 2024, open access, peer-reviewed, and full-text availability. Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were carried out by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias in included randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was employed to assess the strength of evidence and determine its generalizability. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) have diverse mechanisms of toxicity, including inflammation, hypoxia, cardiovascular stress, and metabolic changes. Reported adverse effects include cough, throat irritation, nausea, and hemodynamic changes. However, ENDS are associated with fewer risks compared to conventional cigarette smoking. ENDS users experience fewer respiratory and cardiovascular issues and have lower levels of biomarkers such as NNAL and CO compared to traditional smokers. Additionally, ENDS are more effective than nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patches) for smoking cessation, particularly in pregnant women. The side effects of ENDS and nicotine-free vaping are similar to those of conventional smoking in pregnant women, with the exception of a lower birth weight among newborns exposed to ENDS (p < 0.05). ENDS present a complex balance of benefits and risks regarding respiratory health. While there are adverse effects, ENDS are considered less detrimental than conventional smoking and a viable option for smoking cessation. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate their safety with long-term use (>16 weeks). Policymakers and health practitioners should use these findings to develop balanced public health policies that weigh the benefits of ENDS against potential health risks, enabling informed decision-making for users."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Most patients receiving opioid agonist treatment (OAT) smoke tobacco. Approved cessation interventions are less effective in this group than the wider population. We investigated how people on OAT experience nicotine vaping to quit smoking. METHODS: Patients on OAT randomised to the vaping arm of a smoking cessation trial were invited to participate in structured interviews incorporating broad pre-determined themes. A qualitative descriptive approach employing template analysis was used. Four authors coded transcripts, discussed discrepancies, modified the template using both inductive and deductive approaches. Authors made explicit their starting orientations and independent authors sought disconfirmatory data in a subsequent round of analysis. RESULTS: Four women and eight men (median age 44 years) participated, including four who identified as Aboriginal. Participants reported vaping as cheaper, more acceptable and less stigmatising than smoking but expressed concerns about ongoing accessibility due to the Australian prescription access model. Some found it technically challenging at first, but not more so than standard nicotine replacement therapies. Participants gave accounts of craving and withdrawal experiences, including supplementary use of nicotine patches, and compulsions to vape frequently and intensely, potentially indicating need for higher nicotine dosage. Participants generally reported that vaping helped them quit smoking, though some worried about swapping nicotine addictions. Others were glad to be using a lower-risk alternative. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This group reported varied experiences of nicotine vaping but were mainly optimistic that it could help them and others quit smoking. This was despite initial nicotine cravings and concerns about remaining addicted long-term.",

This study sought to understand what a vaping cessation program should look like from the perspective of current and former vapers, and professionals/experts involved in this health space, to inform the development of a conceptual model. AIMS AND METHODS: Data collection was informed by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) using co-design methodology to explore vaping cessation. Interactive workshops and semi-structured interviews were held online between March 2023 and January 2024, with data from participants' narratives and written materials thematically analyzed. RESULTS: YAs (18-24 years) identifying as current or former vapers (n = 15) and health professionals/experts'(n = 13) insights informed the model framework, incorporating three main elements based on environmental, personal, and behavioral factors shaping vaping cessation. Four design considerations were identified; the program needs to be affordable, accessible, appropriate, and adaptable. YAs expressed a strong preference to share their quitting journey with peers, endorsing a digital forum providing a hybrid framework of support. CONCLUSIONS: Vaping cessation is nuanced and complex requiring a multi-faceted approach targeted to the specific needs of the young adult population. IMPLICATIONS: The findings can be used to inform the development of a vaping cessation program tailored to YA in Australia and other similar contexts. YA perceived sharing the quitting journey and being inspired by the lived experience of others as critical components for successful vaping cessation. SCT is demonstrated to be a valuable behavior change framework for understanding vaping cessation and should be considered in future research on intervention development.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The E-cigarette industry's marketing and social media efforts have promoted adolescent vaping. We developed and pilot-tested an anti-vaping media literary program-MediaSense. AIMS AND METHODS: In addition to employing the Community-Based Participatory Research approach for program development, we applied a prospective, interventional, and single-arm design to assess the impact of MediaSense among students from five middle and high schools. Data were collected through REDCap surveys administered before and after the intervention. We performed generalized linear mixed models and median analysis to evaluate changes in vaping media literacy (ie, Authors and Audiences [vAA], Messages and Meanings [vMM], and Representation and Reality [vRR]), knowledge, harm perception, and susceptibility to e-cigarette use before and after the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 384 students aged 11-18 years completed the pre-post survey assessment. After the intervention, students exhibited significantly improved vaping media literacy across all three domains (vAA, fold change [FC] = 150%, p < .0001; vMM, FC = 143%, p < .0001; vRR, FC = 133%, p = .0007). The intervention was associated with a reduction of vaping susceptibility (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.7, p = .04) and improvement in harm perception (AOR = 1.6, p = .009), knowledge of flavored e-cigarettes (AOR = 4.4, p < .0001) and Tobacco 21 policy (AOR = 6.2, p < .0001). Further mediation analysis unveiled the pathway of the intervention on reduction of vaping susceptibility through media literacy (βindirect = -0.03, p = .003) and harm perception enhancement (βindirect = -0.02, p = .03). CONCLUSIONS: The MediaSense program showed promise in vaping prevention among adolescents by reducing vaping susceptibility. Comprehensive vaping media literacy education, especially interventions aimed at decoding misleading marketing information and addressing emerging marketing themes, provides valuable evidence in curbing adolescent vaping. IMPLICATIONS: MediaSense (Media Education for Sensible Evaluation and Nurturing Substance-free Experiences) represents a promising e-cigarette education program designed for adolescent vaping prevention. The findings of this study highlight the positive impact of the program on media literacy, harm perception, and knowledge of tobacco control policies.",

METHODS: Forty Latino young adults (ages 18 to 25) who were currently vaping received Kick Vaping, a vaping cessation text messaging intervention available in English and Spanish. Feasibility was measured by the eligibility, enrollment, and follow-up rates. Acceptability was measured by overall satisfaction with the intervention. Preliminary impact was measured by self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence and changes in self-efficacy. RESULTS: Two hundred three individuals were identified, 61 were assessed for eligibility, and 55 were eligible. Forty individuals consented to participate and were enrolled in Kick Vaping. At baseline, most participants used disposable devices (70%), vaped daily (97.5%), had low (37.5%) or medium (35.0%) e-cigarette dependence, and had attempted to quit in the past year (72.5%). At Month 3, the follow-up rate was 90% (36/40). Treating those lost to follow-up as participants who continued vaping, 75% (30/40) of participants self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence. Self-efficacy mean scores significantly increased from 30.65 (SD 8.07) at baseline to 50.11 (SD 10.57) at follow-up (p < 0.01). Most participants (88.9%, 32/36) reported being satisfied/extremely satisfied with Kick Vaping. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to recruit and retain Latino young adults in a vaping cessation text messaging intervention. Kick Vaping generated high satisfaction among Latino young adults, significantly increased self-efficacy, and resulted in a notable vaping cessation rate at Month 3. Additional testing in a randomized controlled trial is warranted to assess the efficacy of the intervention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electronic nicotine delivery systems (\"e-cigarettes\") are the nicotine product most commonly used by adolescents. Research, treatment, and policy could benefit from measures of adolescent e-cigarette beliefs about outcomes of use (ie, expectancies). In the current study, we developed and tested an adolescent electronic nicotine vaping expectancy measure. METHODS: A focus group with adolescents evaluated potential e-cigarette expectancy items. A panel of national experts assisted in revision of these items. Finally, items were administered to a sample of adolescents 14-17 years old (N = 267, Mean age 15.6, SD = 1.1, 50.9% Female, 50.2% Non-Hispanic White, 22.5% Non-Hispanic Black, 14.2% Hispanic) in a large Southeastern metropolitan area in the United States. RESULTS: Exploratory Factor Analysis revealed a four factor solution: Negative Consequences (Cronbach's α = .92); Positive Reinforcement (α = .83); Negative Affect Reduction (α = .95); and Weight Control (α = .89). Subscales were significantly correlated with vaping susceptibility and lifetime vaping. Subscales successfully differentiated susceptible adolescents from confirmed non-susceptible adolescents, with susceptible adolescents reporting more positive expectancies, eg, Positive Reinforcement, M = 5.0, SD = 2.0 vs M = 3.0, SD = 2.1, P < .001, η2 = 0.19, and less negative expectancies, M = 5.5, SD = 2.3 vs M = 6.5, SD = 2.6, P = .001, η2 = 0.04. Similar results were found comparing adolescents who have never vaped nicotine with those who have vaped nicotine. Hierarchical linear regression demonstrated subscales were significant predictors of lifetime vaping after controlling for demographics, vaping ad exposure, and peer/family vaping. CONCLUSIONS: A preliminary version of an adolescent expectancy measure appears reliable and valid based on expert input and pilot testing with adolescents. Promising results were found in the domains of concurrent validity, discriminant validity, and incremental validity. Future research and evaluation efforts will be able to use this tool to further prevention and treatment goals."

      "abstract": "ISSUE ADDRESSED: E-cigarettes are a significant concern in schools due to their rising use by adolescents. This research aimed to identify current and preferred intervention strategies to respond to vaping in the Western Australian school setting. METHODS: Interviews and focus groups were held with 15 school professionals (leaders, teachers and nurses), parents (n = 12) and students aged 13-17 years (n = 32). Discussions were transcribed verbatim, anonymised and thematically analysed using a deductive approach aligned to the Health Promoting Schools Framework. RESULTS: Participants suggested that limited and varied attention has been directed towards policy in response to vaping in the school setting. Teaching and learning opportunities existed for students, parents and school professionals, albeit somewhat ad hoc in their approach. Additional training would benefit the whole-school community (students, parents and staff) to raise awareness of e-cigarette harms, increase knowledge and build skills in responding to student vaping. CONCLUSIONS: Clearly articulated policies are needed to guide school strategies and actions towards vaping. There needs to be a dedicated, developmentally appropriate, cross-subject vaping curriculum for students that incorporates mental health outcomes and social skills reinforcement; professional development for school staff; awareness of and access to school-based health services for help and information; visual cues to de-normalise vaping and parent and community involvement to support vape-free school environments. SO WHAT?: Comprehensive prevention activities are required to reduce the uptake of vaping among adolescents. Building students', school professionals' and parents' awareness of vaping and strategies to prevent use will contribute to de-normalising and reducing this practice among adolescents.",

      "abstract": "The emergence and subsequent surge in popularity of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), especially among adolescents and young adults, have reshaped the landscape of tobacco consumption, including use patterns and beliefs as well as therapeutic approaches to the condition. The health implications of ENDS are a cause for concern among NPs, as they include severe nicotine dependence, mental health consequences, and adverse effects on respiratory and cardiac systems, among other issues. This article focuses on the health implications of vaping across the lifespan and emphasizes the need for NPs to evaluate ENDS use consistently across age groups and offer age-appropriate treatment within the clinical setting. Importantly, although vaping is prevalent among various age groups, most tobacco use, including vaping, begins and becomes established during adolescence. This back-to-school season therefore marks an ideal time for NPs to educate their pediatric patients, along with their parents or caregivers, about the widespread effects of vaping on health, and it also serves as a reminder to screen for the condition in adults, regardless of smoking history. To combat this trend on a larger scale, NPs can further advocate for community health by promoting youth prevention programs and supporting policy initiatives aimed at curbing ENDS use.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Initially introduced as a safer alternative to smoking, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and vaping have since been associated with lung injury. Nevertheless, there is limited perioperative data on their potential contribution to the harmful effects of mechanical ventilation on the lungs. We hypothesized that, in adults undergoing noncardiothoracic surgeries, preoperative vaping/e-cigarette use is associated with hypoxemia during the first postoperative hour, and with an increased incidence of intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary complications. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in which we included patients reporting as vapers/e-cigarette users within one year before surgery as the exposure group, and nonvapers as the control group. The primary outcome was the time-weighted average (TWA) SpO2/FIO2 ratio in the postanesthesia care unit during the first postoperative hour. The secondary outcome was a composite of intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary complications until discharge. We used entropy balancing to adjust for confounding, and fit weighted linear regression and logistic regression models to estimate treatment effects. RESULTS: A total of 110,940 patients met the inclusion criteria, and 1,941 of these were vapers/e-cigarette users. The average treatment effect on the treated for TWA SpO2/FIO2 ratio (N = 109,217) was estimated to be a mean difference of 4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1 to 8; P = 0.007). This is equivalent to a 4% change in SpO2 at a 30% FIO2 (or at a fixed FIO2). The difference was statistically significant. The average treatment effect on the treated for experiencing intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary complications (N = 110,940) was an odds ratio of 1.04 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.54; P = 0.84). CONCLUSION: Vaping/e-cigarette use was neither associated with clinically significant hypoxemia during the first hour in the postanesthesia care unit nor with an increase in pulmonary complications. Nevertheless, our findings cannot definitively exclude the deleterious effects of vaping and e-cigarette use on the lungs, and anesthesiologists should consider potential perioperative complications.",

Despite known harms of nicotine exposure among teens, there are no empirically tested vaping cessation interventions. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a text message program for nicotine vaping cessation among adolescents with assessment-only control. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A parallel, 2-group, double-blind, individually randomized clinical trial with follow-ups at 1 and 7 months after randomization was conducted from October 1, 2021, to October 18, 2023. Participants were recruited via social media ads; the intervention was delivered via text message; and assessments were completed online or by telephone. Eligible individuals were US residents aged 13 to 17 years who reported past 30-day e-cigarette use, were interested in quitting within 30 days, and owned a mobile phone with an active text message plan. To optimize study retention, all participants received monthly assessments via text message about e-cigarette use. INTERVENTIONS: Assessment-only controls (n = 744) received only study retention text messages. Intervention participants (n = 759) also received an automated, interactive text message program for vaping cessation that delivers cognitive and behavioral coping skills training and social support. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was self-reported 30-day point-prevalence abstinence from vaping at 7 months analyzed as intention-to-treat, with missingness coded as vaping. RESULTS: Among n = 1503 adolescents randomized, average age was 16.4 (SD, 0.8) years. The sample was 50.6% female, 42.1% male, and 7.4% nonbinary/other; 10.2% Black/African American, 62.6% White, 18.5% multiracial, and 8.7% another race; 16.2% Hispanic; 42.5% sexual minority; and 76.2% vaped within 30 minutes of waking. The 7-month follow-up rate was 70.8%. Point-prevalence abstinence rates were 37.8% (95% CI, 34.4%-41.3%) among intervention participants and 28.0% (95% CI, 24.9%-31.3%) among control participants (relative risk, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.17-1.57]; P < .001). No baseline variables moderated the treatment-outcome relationship. There was no evidence that adolescents who quit vaping transitioned to combustible tobacco products. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A tailored, interactive text message intervention increased self-reported vaping cessation rates among adolescents recruited via social media channels.

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, vaping has increased in popularity among young adults. Yet, little is known about the daily activities or contexts associated with vaping behavior. The current study examined whether nicotine vaping, cannabis vaping, and dual-substance vaping (i.e., vaping both nicotine and cannabis) fluctuated in tandem with alcohol use and activities on a given day. Data came from the Monitoring the Future Vaping Supplement, a national sample of U.S. young adults. A subsample of people who vaped (N = 330 people) completed up to 14 daily surveys (N = 3686 days). Multilevel logistic regressions separated within- and between-person characteristics and controlled for combustible nicotine and cannabis use, day of the week, and demographic characteristics. Weights accounted for the complex survey design and attrition. Results demonstrated that nicotine vaping was more common on days when participants drank moderately or binge drank (compared to not drinking), used cigarettes, and spent more time at bars and parties than usual. Cannabis vaping on a given day was more likely on days when young adults drank moderately and spent more time at bars/parties. Likewise, moderate drinking, spending more time at bars/parties than usual, and spending less time on schoolwork than usual was associated with a higher likelihood of dual-substance vaping on a given day. Our findings highlight when young adults vape nicotine and cannabis, while also identifying proximal correlates of these behaviors to inform intervention and cessation efforts.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While public health efforts have made tobacco smoking near obsolete among adolescents, vaping products are quickly taking their place. With the negative health consequences looming ahead of young vapers, there is a desperate need to curb youth vaping. Adolescents want to be actively engaged in their health which creates space to educate on vaping in this population segment. METHODS: From January to May 2023, 35 adolescents aged 11-18 participated in interviews to assess the investigator-developed Teen E-cigarette and Vaping Educational Resource (T-EVER). All the interviews were recorded and transcribed for independent analysis by two study team members. RESULTS: The participants liked the T-EVER, indicating they were engaged in the content. However, some participants wanted more information. The participants wanted health professionals to educate them on vaping but were worried about the potential barriers facing the implementation in community pharmacy settings. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents want to learn about vaping, but there are limited opportunities to do so. The T-EVER is designed to educate youth about vaping. This tool was well received and has the potential to be used by pharmacists as a vaping prevention and cessation intervention. More research is required to discern the true scope of the pharmacist's role in using an educational tool to address adolescent vaping."

We examine how youth vaping has been framed in the Australian news media in the six months leading up to the announcement of these new measures in May 2023. METHODS: Drawing a sample from the Factiva database, we conducted a frame analysis on articles published during this six month period, identifying media framings that included the necessary components of a distinct Problem Definition, Causal Attribution, Moral Evaluation, and Treatment Recommendation. RESULTS: We identified 123 relevant articles, and four dominant framings being applied. Most common was that of A Failure of Control, followed by A Poisonous Epidemic, A Health Behaviour Needing Regulation, and A Moral Failure. CONCLUSION: These findings are discussed in the context of moral panic theory and how framings are constructed by the media in collaboration with policy actors to support particular policy measures.",

Among a prospective cohort of young adults from California who screened negative for depression, we estimated repeated-measures marginal structural models to examine the association of 4 vaping transitions from time T to T + 1 (persistent use, discontinuation, initiation, persistent nonuse) with risk of clinically significant depressive symptoms at T + 1, simultaneously across three ~ 1.5-year time intervals between 2017 and 2021. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights adjusted for time-dependent confounders and selection bias. Among n = 3496 observations (1806 participants, mean pooled baseline age = 19.5), 8.1% reported persistent vaping from T to T + 1, 6.2% reported discontinuation (ie, use at T and no use at T + 1), 6.5% initiated e-cigarettes (ie, no use at T and use at T + 1), and 79.2% reported persistent nonuse at both time points. Compared to persistent vaping at 2 waves, persistent nonuse (relative risk [RR] = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93) and discontinuation (RR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.96) were associated with lower risk of depression. Associations were robust to sensitivity analyses, including restricting to tobacco-naive participants and varying temporal assumptions to reduce potential for reverse causation.

We sought to address some of these gaps using the nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (PATH) to estimate longitudinal associations between nicotine vaping and the initiation of cannabis or other substances among adolescents transitioning to adulthood from2013 to 2019, adjusting for treatment-confounder feedback. Estimands like the longitudinal average treatment effect were not identified because of extensive practical positivity violations. Therefore, we estimated longitudinal incremental propensity score effects, which were identified. We found that reduced odds of nicotine vaping were associated with decreased risks of cannabis or other substance initiation; these associations strengthened over time. For example, by the final wave (2018-19), cannabis and other substance initiation risks were 6.2 (95%CI:4.6-7.7) and 1.8 (95%CI:0.4-3.2) percentage points lower when odds of nicotine vaping were reduced to be 90% lower in all preceding waves (2013-14 to 2016-18), as compared with observed risks. Strategies to lower nicotine vaping prevalence during this period may have resulted in fewer young people initiating cannabis and other substances."

We present a case of a 35-year-old male who presented to the emergency department (ED) with oropharyngeal burns after utilizing a vape pen that malfunctioned. The patient had visible burns on his uvula, as well as on the soft and hard palate. Additionally, he had symptoms of difficulty swallowing and a hoarse voice, which raised concerns about a possible deeper airway or lung injury. The patient required a flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy by a head and neck surgeon, which revealed mild edema and erythema of the epiglottis and the arytenoids. The patient was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation and treatment with analgesia and dexamethasone. The following morning, the patient's symptoms had improved. The repeat nasopharyngolaryngoscopy showed improvement in the swelling of the epiglottis and arytenoids, and the patient was deemed stable for discharge. This case brings attention to the variety of injuries possible from e-cigarette use and the importance of prompt management of oropharyngeal thermal injuries."

Smoking prevention programs focused on peer-group leaders have shown great promise, and a social influence model has proven effective in understanding adult smoking networks but has not been applied to adolescent vaping until 2023. This work aims to apply a social influence model to analyze vaping by gender in a high school network. METHODS: A high school's student body was emailed an online survey asking for gender, age, grade level, vape status, and the names of three friends. Custom Java and MATLAB scripts were written to create a directed graph, compute centrality measures, and perform Fisher's exact tests to compare centrality measures by demographic variables and vape status. RESULTS: Of 192 students in the school, 102 students responded. Students who vape were in closer-knit friend groups than students who do not vape (p < .05). Compared to males who vape, females who vape had more social ties to other students who vape, exhibiting greater homophily (p < .01). Compared to females who do not vape, females who vape were in closer-knit friend groups (p < .05) and had more ties to other students who vape (p < .01). CONCLUSION: Differences in vaping by social connectedness and gender necessitate school and state policies incorporating the social aspect of vaping in public health initiatives. Large-scale research should determine if trends can be generalized across student bodies, and more granular studies should investigate differences in motivations and social influence by demographic variables to individualize cessation strategies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given that cannabis and e-cigarettes are among the most commonly used substances among young people, there is a need to identify risk factors for concurrent cannabis consumption and nicotine vaping among youth and young adults. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Truth Longitudinal Cohort, collected from September 2020 to March 2021, among a cohort aged 15-24 years (N = 6379). Chi-square tests were conducted to detect differences in sample characteristics by dual use status (never e-cigarette and never cannabis users, never cannabis and former/noncurrent e-cigarette users, never e-cigarette and former/noncurrent cannabis users, former/noncurrent e-cigarette and cannabis users, current e-cigarette only users, current cannabis only users, and concurrent cannabis and e-cigarette dual users). Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine key demographic variables predicting dual use status. RESULTS: Household tobacco use (Relative Risk Ratio, RRR = 4.93), higher sensation seeking (RRR = 3.98), and mental health score (RRR = 2.58) were associated with higher risk of dual use. Being 15-17 years (RRR = 0.22), being female (RRR = 0.59) and having parents with an education level of some college or more (RRR = 0.64) were associated with lower risk of dual use. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the need to carefully monitor cannabis and vaping nicotine among young people. The identification of risk factors provides additional guidance for prevention and treatment efforts, suggesting the need to address use of both substances and target those most at risk.",

In this study, YAs aged 18-24 living in the United States interested in vaping cessation treatment were recruited to complete an online survey regarding demographics and EC use. Primary eligibility criteria were EC use on at least 20 days per month (no other tobacco use), and interest in quitting in the next month. We report descriptive statistics for those who did and did not complete a mandatory coaching call (n = 981). In this sample, most EC users reported high nicotine dependence, a history of unsuccessful quit attempts (including 29.4% with previous NRT use), along with stress, anxiety, and depression. There were few meaningful differences in demographics, EC use behaviors, or behavioral health factors between those who engaged with a phone coaching call (fully enrolled in study; n = 508), and those who did not (n = 473). YAs demonstrated interest in vaping cessation support, but there were no clear characteristics for the half who did not complete a coaching call. Vaping cessation program designers should consider tailoring for the self-reported behavioral health concerns present in this population.",

These aerosols contain toxic, carcinogenic compounds and nicotine, an addictive substance. In Argentina, the commercialization of electronic cigarettes is prohibited. Acute lung injury associated with vaping (EVALI) is an acute respiratory disease that can be life threatening. An 18-year-old male patient, smoker, consulted for shortness of breath and fever. He presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, and leukocytosis. The patient reported use of electronic cigarettes. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed extensive areas of ground glass opacities with areas of consolidation with air bronchogram. Antibiotic treatment was started and a fibrobronchoscopy was performed, which showed hematic debris, without endoluminal lesions. A diagnosis of EVALI was done and high doses systemic corticosteroids were prescribed. The patient evolved favorably, hewas discharged 48 hours after the end of treatment. In the control ambulatory CT was observed an improvement of the lesions. EVALI is an exclusion diagnosis, so it is necessary to rule out infectious diseases and pulmonary inflammatory processes. There are different scores that describe the probability of EVALI. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), developed in 2019 a definition of confirmed case based on vape exposure, imaging, clinical presentation and history. In 2019 was first reported an EVALI in Argentina. It is important to know the criteria for a confirmed case to initiate accurate and early treatment, considering the exponential increase in electronic cigarette use, mainly in the young population.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Smoking during pregnancy is harmful to maternal and child health. Vaping is used for smoking cessation but evidence on health effects during pregnancy is scarce. We conducted a systematic review of health outcomes of vaping during pregnancy. METHODS: We searched six databases for maternal/fetal/infant outcomes and vaping, including quantitative, English language, human studies of vaping during pregnancy, to November 10th, 2023. We assessed study quality with the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. We focused on comparisons of exclusive-vaping with non-use of nicotine and tobacco products and with smoking. Presentation is narrative as the studies were of insufficient quality to conduct meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 26 studies, with 765,527 women, with one randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing vaping and nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation, 23 cohort studies and two case-control studies. While the RCT met 4/5 quality criteria, the quality of the cohort studies and case-control studies was poor; none adequately assessed exposure to smoking and vaping. For studies comparing exclusive-vaping with 'non-use', more reported no increased risk for vaping (three studies) than reported increased risk for maternal pregnancy/postpartum outcomes (one study) and for fetal and infant outcomes (20 studies no increased risk, four increased risk), except for birth-weight and neurological outcomes where two studies each observed increased and no increased risk. When the RCT compared non-users with those not smoking but vaping or using NRT, irrespective of randomisation, they reported no evidence of risk for vaping/NRT. For studies comparing exclusive-vaping and exclusive-smoking, most studies provided evidence for a comparable risk for different outcomes. One maternal biomarker study revealed a lower risk for vaping. For small-for-gestational-age/mean-birth-centile equal numbers of studies found lower risk for vaping than for smoking as found similar risk for the two groups (two each). CONCLUSIONS: While more studies found no evidence of increased risk of exclusive-vaping compared with non-use and evidence of comparable risk for exclusive-vaping and exclusive-smoking, the quality of the evidence limits conclusions. Without adequate assessment of exposure to vaping and smoking, findings cannot be attributed to behaviour as many who vape will have smoked and many who vape may do so at low levels.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many people continue to smoke despite strong policies to deter use, thus stronger regulatory measures may be required. In four high-income countries, we examined whether people who smoke would support a total ban on smoked tobacco products under two differing policy scenarios. METHODS: Data were from 14 363 adults (≥18) who smoked cigarettes (≥monthly) and participated in at least one of the 2018, 2020 or 2022 International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Surveys in Australia, Canada, England and the USA. In 2018, respondents were asked whether they would support a law that totally bans smoked tobacco if the government provides smoking cessation assistance (Cessation Assistance scenario). In 2020 and 2022, respondents were asked a slightly different question as to whether they would support a law that totally bans smoked tobacco if the government encourages people who smoke to use alternative nicotine products like vaping products and nicotine replacement products instead (substitution scenario). Responses (support vs oppose/don't know) were estimated on weighted data. RESULTS: Support was greater for the cessation assistance scenario (2018, 36.6%) than the nicotine substitution scenario (2020, 26.9%; 2022, 26.3%, both p<0.0001). In the longitudinal analysis, there was a significant scenario by country interaction effect with lower support in Canada, the USA and Australia under the substitution scenario than in the cessation scenario, but equivalent levels in England under both scenarios. The strongest correlates of support under both scenarios were planning to quit smoking within 6 months, wanting to quit smoking 'a lot' and recent use of nicotine replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Opposition to banning smoked tobacco predominates among people who smoke, but less with a cessation assistance scenario than one encouraging nicotine substitution. Wanting to quit a lot was the strongest indicator of support."

      "abstract": "Despite declines in adolescent nicotine vaping during the COVID-19 pandemic, vaping continues to be a public health issue for many adolescents. Most studies on teen reasons for vaping and on barriers and facilitators of vaping were conducted prior to the pandemic. Because teen culture changes so rapidly, and because the pandemic had wide-reaching effects on teens and mental health, it is critical to have a current understanding what helps adolescents to quit vaping (facilitators), as well as what prevents them from quitting (barriers) in order to design effective and engaging interventions. The objective of this qualitative study was to examine reasons for vaping, and barriers and facilitators to quitting vaping among high school age (14-18 years old) students. Students (n = 28; 60.7 % female; 50 % White, 10.7 % Black or African American, 25 % Asian or Asian American, 3.6 % other non-Hispanic; 7.2 % Hispanic; 21.4 % former vapers, 78.6 % current vapers) were recruited online from four regions in the US and participated in one of five online focus groups. We conducted a content analysis of the focus groups using a team-based coding approach. The most frequently cited reasons for vaping were mood, peer influence, and boredom. Results also showed that the stigma of seeking treatment acted as a barrier to quitting vaping, while self-reflection acted as a facilitator. In addition, two factors, peer influence and health effects, served as both barriers and facilitators, depending on the context. Program developers can use this information to design engaging vaping cessation programs intended for adolescents.",

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or vape is a battery-powered nicotine delivery device that substitutes for traditional cigarettes. The chemical components of vaping, including propylene glycol and nicotine, can cause hypersensitivity reactions. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of oral erythema multiforme in an e-cigarettes user, treatment, and review the literature regarding the impact of these devices on oral health. CLINICAL CASE: A 22-year-old woman came to the Oral Medicine Department with complaints of stomatitis causing pain, eating, and drinking difficulty, which started with fever and pimple-like on the lips. She was an active vape user for one year. Extraoral examination revealed no lesions on other body parts. The serosanguinolent crusts on the lips, an erosive area on the labial commissures and tended to bleed. Intraoral examination revealed white ulcers with yellowish edges and irregular, varying sizes in several parts of the oral mucosa. The anti-HSV-1 IgG laboratory results showed non-reactive, leading to a diagnosis of oral erythema multiforme. Management of oral conditions using 0.9% NaCl compress, dexamethasone mouthwash, and hyaluronic acid, applying 2% miconazole cream on labial commissures and vaseline album cream on the dry lips, and stopping vaping. Oral condition improved in a week of therapy. CONCLUSION: Erythema multiforme restricted to the mouth is rare, especially associated with electronic cigarettes. Early identification of oral ulcerative disorders is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment, where clinicians should consider oral erythema multiforme as a possible diagnosis."

Although health risks of long-term e-cigarette use remain unknown, there is evidence of acute physiological harms. Most young adults who vape report intent to quit, but little is known about effective interventions. This protocol paper reports on the development and design of a pilot trial of a vaping intervention for young military Veterans. Young adult Veterans accessing VA healthcare (n = 20) who vape daily and have been referred for cessation services will be enrolled. To maximize accessibility the intervention will be delivered virtually; participants will be randomized to receive behavioral counseling by telephone or by video telehealth. The intervention was adapted from an existing program targeting young adult cigarette smokers and will include 6 individual counseling sessions delivered over 8 weeks. Assessment visits will occur at baseline, at end-of-treatment, and 4 weeks later. Analyses will evaluate feasibility and acceptability of the intervention overall, and will compare telephone and video telehealth modalities. Longitudinal regression will be used to evaluate changes in vaping behavior and in nicotine dependence over time. This study will provide assessment of a novel intervention adapted for Veterans who vape nicotine. The comparison of two modalities of virtual intervention delivery will increase knowledge and the potential to disseminate across VA and other healthcare systems. Findings from this pilot trial will inform the design of future, larger studies of vaping cessation interventions for younger Veterans."

Screen questions were updated to include \"vaping\" in the parenthetical examples of nicotine and cannabis use. RESULTS: Data from 502 adolescent participants who completed both the S2BI or BSTAD and vaping questions were analyzed. The S2BI and BSTAD identified 92% (23/25) and 100% (16/16) of nicotine vaping and 100% (16/16) and 95.5% (21/22) of cannabis vaping, respectively.

While these conditions rarely occur simultaneously, their coexistence significantly escalates both mortality and morbidity. Management strategies typically involve a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating diagnostic evaluation through imaging, administration of antibiotics, and often surgical drainage. While antibiotics are fundamental in treating both conditions, empyema management almost invariably necessitates surgical intervention. Initial imaging usually involves plain radiographs, although ultrasound and lung CT scans provide heightened sensitivity and fluid characterization. Here, we present the case of a 24-year-old morbidly obese patient with a history of bronchial asthma initially presenting with community-acquired pneumonia, which subsequently deteriorated into lung abscess and empyema, ultimately requiring surgical intervention."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of e-cigarette use among US adults, especially young adults, is rising. Many would like to quit vaping nicotine but are unable to do so. Cytisinicline, a plant-based alkaloid, targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, reduces nicotine dependence, and helps adults to stop smoking cigarettes. Cytisinicline may also help e-cigarette users to quit vaping. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of cytisinicline vs placebo to produce abstinence from e-cigarette use in adults seeking to quit vaping nicotine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial compared 12 weeks of treatment with cytisinicline vs placebo, with follow-up to 16 weeks. It was conducted from July 2022 to February 2023 across 5 US clinical trial sites. A total of 160 adults who vaped nicotine daily, sought to quit, and did not currently smoke cigarettes were enrolled, and 131 (81.9%) completed the trial. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized (2:1) to cytisinicline, 3 mg, taken 3 times daily (n = 107) or placebo (n = 53) for 12 weeks. All participants received weekly behavioral support. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biochemically verified continuous e-cigarette abstinence during the last 4 weeks of treatment (weeks 9-12; primary outcome) and through 4 weeks posttreatment (weeks 9-16; secondary outcome). Missing outcomes were counted as nonabstinence. RESULTS: Of 160 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 33.6 [11.1] years; 83 [51.9%] female), 115 (71.9%) formerly smoked (≥100 lifetime cigarettes). Continuous e-cigarette abstinence in cytisinicline and placebo groups occurred in 34 of 107 participants (31.8%) vs 8 of 53 participants (15.1%) (odds ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.06-7.10; P = .04) at end of treatment (weeks 9-12) and in 25 of 107 participants (23.4%) vs 7 of 53 participants (13.2%) during weeks 9 to 16 (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.82-5.32; P = .15). There was no evidence, based on nonsignificant interactions, that cytisinicline efficacy differed in subgroups defined by demographic characteristics, vaping pattern, e-cigarette dependence, or smoking history. Cytisinicline was well tolerated, with 4 participants (3.8%) discontinuing cytisinicline due to an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, cytisinicline for 12 weeks, with behavioral support, demonstrated efficacy for cessation of e-cigarette use at end of treatment and was well tolerated by adults, offering a potential pharmacotherapy option for treating nicotine e-cigarette use in adults who seek to quit vaping. These results need confirmation in a larger trial with longer follow-up. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05431387.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To synthesize existing evidence on possible differential effects by sex and gender from two Cochrane reviews evaluating vaping and smoking transitions. METHODS: We screened included studies from two Cochrane reviews for studies reporting smoking outcomes based on gender or sex. The first review examines the effects of using e-cigarettes to help people quit smoking and includes randomized controlled trials and uncontrolled intervention studies published to July 2023. The second review aims to assess the evidence on the relationship between the use and availability of e-cigarettes and subsequent smoking in young people (aged 29 and younger) and includes quasi-experimental and cohort studies published to April 2023. Due to the paucity and heterogeneity of data, we report results narratively. RESULTS: 10 of 161 studies included in the two relevant reviews met our criteria. Only five reported analyzing whether observed effects or associations varied based on sex and/or gender. A further three provided relevant descriptive information, and two did not report overall outcomes regarding vaping and smoking transitions but did investigate whether these differed by sex/gender. Synthesized data were largely inconclusive, but there was some suggestion that vaping was more strongly associated with subsequent smoking in young males than females. No studies reported data on nonbinary participants. CONCLUSIONS: Despite plausible reasons why sex and gender may be moderators of vaping and smoking transitions, there is little evidence investigating this. Future studies of vaping and smoking transitions should conduct and report analyses investigating potential differences based on sex and gender.",

METHODS: Scopus and OVID Medline were searched for papers published between 2013 and 2023. Two authors independently selected the studies and extracted data, with conflicts resolved through discussion. Nine studies were selected for further synthesis. Reporting follows the PRISMA Scoping Reviews checklist. RESULTS: E-cigarettes were commonly perceived as less harmful compared to conventional cigarettes and less detrimental to cancer treatment effectiveness among people with a current or previous cancer diagnosis. This population also cited smoking cessation, smoking in non-smoking areas and less risky alternative as the most common reasons for e-cigarette use. Nevertheless, low levels of clinician support on the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool/alternative were identified. CONCLUSION: Findings show differences in beliefs and attitudes of e-cigarettes between clinicians and people diagnosed with cancer. Additional research into the health impacts of e-cigarettes in people with a current or previous cancer diagnosis will allow for greater congruence between patients and clinicians and assist providers in recommending effective tools for smoking cessation within this population. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: This study provides an overview of the attitudes, beliefs and perceptions of e-cigarette use among people with a current or previous diagnosis of cancer and health practitioners. Given the increased prevalence of e-cigarette use within this population, these findings highlight a greater need for dialogue between patients and clinicians regarding the safety and efficacy of these devices."

      "abstract": "E-cigarettes and vaping products were first introduced in the United States around 2007, and quickly grew in popularity. By 2014, e-cigarettes had become the most commonly used tobacco product among youth in the United States. An e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) outbreak was identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2019, with many cases in the adolescent population. The CDC opened a national database of cases and launched a multistate investigation; reported cases reached a peak in September 2019. The CDC investigation found that a vaping liquid additive, vitamin E acetate, was strongly linked to the EVALI outbreak but determined that the decline in cases was likely multifactorial. Due to decreased cases and the identification of a potential cause of the outbreak, the CDC stopped collecting data on EVALI cases as of February 2020. However, e-cigarettes and vaping products have continued to be the most popular tobacco product among youth, though state and national regulations on these products have increased since 2016. While pediatric case series and studies have shown differences in clinical presentation and medical histories between pediatric and adult EVALI cases, the fact that cases are no longer tracked at a national level limits necessary information for pediatric clinicians and researchers. We describe the available literature on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment, and outcomes of EVALI in the pediatric population, and provide clinical and public health recommendations to facilitate prevention and management of EVALI specific to pediatrics.",

METHODS: We analyzed 2022 cross-sectional survey data (from a larger longitudinal study) among 172 US young adult, past-month e-cigarette users (mean age=26.95 years; 57.6% female; 73.3% White). We examined: 1) perceived challenges to quitting e-cigarettes; 2) perceived impact of intervention messages targeting motivation and confidence, and their associations with quitting importance and confidence; and 3) poly-use with cigarettes and/or cannabis in relation to poly-product cessation preferences. RESULTS: In all, 43.6% reported past-year e-cigarette quit attempts, and 55.3% reported quit readiness; 30.2% reported past-month poly-use with cigarettes, and 54.1% with cannabis. Frequently endorsed challenges to quitting/cutting down were related to stress/anxiety (41.9%), delaying cessation attempts (35.5%), and boredom (25.6%). Messages targeting motivation perceived as most impactful (scale: 1 = 'no impact at all' to 7 = 'a lot of impact') were related to saving money (mean score=4.78), improving health (mean score=4.15), and avoiding toxic chemicals (mean score=4.04), messages targeting confidence perceived as most impactful were related to patience (mean score=4.47), staying busy (mean score=4.27), and soliciting support (mean score=3.84). Perceiving greater impact of messages targeting motivation was associated with greater quitting importance (B=1.16; 95% CI: 0.71-1.60, p<0.001). Neither perceived impact of messages targeting motivation nor confidence were related to quitting confidence. E-cigarette-cannabis poly-users preferred to quit cigarettes first, e-cigarette-cigarette users preferred to quit cannabis first, and poly-users of all three products preferred to quit e-cigarettes first, followed by cigarettes, then cannabis. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette cessation interventions must use relevant messages (e.g. target financial and health benefits of quitting) and consider poly-users' preferences for quitting."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Current measures of vaping behaviors in the U.S. do not distinguish what substances participants are vaping and to what extent they are dual-vaping nicotine and cannabis. This study describes the use of new survey questions that more specifically ask whether participants who vape are vaping nicotine, cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), or another substance. AIMS AND METHODS: Adults, who reported any past 30-day tobacco use, from five New England states participated in an online survey from April 2021 to July 2022. Participants who vaped were asked, \"Have you used any of the following vape substances in the past 30 days?\" with the possible responses of nicotine, cannabis, CBD, other, and \"don't know.\" Dual use of both nicotine and cannabis was defined as the vaping of both nicotine and cannabis and/or CBD in the past 30 days, operationalized as a dichotomous outcome. Data were collected in monthly, repeated cross-sectional waves. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine correlates of dual-vaping. RESULTS: The analytic sample included 1547 adults who reported past 30-day tobacco use (mean age 42.9 years, 62.8% female, 85.4% White, 48.5% income of less than $50 000). Over one-quarter (26.1%) reported dual-vaping in the past 30 days. Identifying as male (p = .002) and self-rated anxiety (p = .043) were associated with a higher odds of dual-vaping. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that a sizable proportion of a sample of New England adults who have used tobacco in the past 30 days are dual-vaping nicotine and cannabis. Adequate survey measures for assessing the vaping of multiple substances can help in better screening and characterization of health behaviors around dual-use. IMPLICATIONS: This study addresses a key gap in adequate survey measures for assessing vaping of multiple substances. We found that among adults with past 30-day tobacco use, dual-vaping was prevalent and associated with different correlates, such as self-reported anxiety and education level, compared to sole-vaping of nicotine or cannabis. Our findings may help in characterizing and targeting future population-level surveillance and intervention efforts for multiple substance use behaviors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: e-Cigarette use, especially by young adults, is at unacceptably high levels and represents a public health risk factor. Digital media are increasingly being used to deliver antivaping campaigns, but little is known about their effectiveness or the dose-response effects of content delivery. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to evaluate (1) the effectiveness of a 60-day antivaping social media intervention in changing vaping use intentions and beliefs related to the stimulus content and (2) the dose-response effects of varying levels of exposure to the intervention on vaping outcomes, including anti-industry beliefs, vaping intentions, and other attitudes and beliefs related to vaping. METHODS: Participants were adults aged 18 to 24 years in the United States. They were recruited into the study through Facebook (Meta Platforms) and Instagram (Meta Platforms), completed a baseline survey, and then randomized to 1 of the 5 conditions: 0 (control), 4, 8, 16, and 32 exposures over a 15-day period between each survey wave. Follow-up data were collected 30 and 60 days after randomization. We conducted stratified analyses of the full sample and in subsamples defined by the baseline vaping status (never, former, and current). Stimulus was delivered through Facebook and Instagram in four 15-second social media videos focused on anti-industry beliefs about vaping. The main outcome measures reported in this study were self-reported exposure to social media intervention content, attitudes and beliefs about vaping, and vaping intentions. We estimated a series of multivariate linear regressions in Stata 17 (StataCorp). To capture the dose-response effect, we assigned each study arm a numerical value corresponding to the number of advertisements (exposures) delivered to participants in each arm and used this number as our focal independent variable. In each model, the predictor was the treatment arm to which each participant was assigned. RESULTS: The baseline sample consisted of 1491 participants, and the final analysis sample consisted of 57.28% (854/1491) of the participants retained at the 60-day follow-up. We compared the retained participants with those lost to follow-up and found no statistically significant differences across demographic variables. We found a significant effect of the social media treatment on vaping intentions (β=-0.138, 95% CI -0.266 to -0.010; P=.04) and anti-industry beliefs (β=-0.122, 95% CI 0.008-0.237; P=.04) targeted by the intervention content among current vapers but not among the full sample or other strata. We found no significant effects of self-reported exposure to the stimulus. CONCLUSIONS: Social media interventions are a promising approach to preventing vaping among young adults. More research is needed on how to optimize the dosage of such interventions and the extent to which long-term exposure may affect vaping use over time.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Deciding how to regulate nicotine vaping products (NVPs) is a challenge for many countries. Balanced regulation should consider the potential harms to young people from uptake of NVPs alongside the possible benefits of NVPs as a smoking cessation aid. One option is to make NVPs only available via medical prescription to adults who smoke. From October 2021, Australia adopted a unique model that allows prescription access to NVPs that meet a product standard without requiring the NVPs to be approved as therapeutic goods. This research explored the impact of this regulatory model on the smoking cessation practices of health professionals, and their views on the model. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 39 Australian health professionals recruited from professional networks and social media. Health professionals were eligible if they provided smoking cessation advice as part of their role, and included medical practitioners (n = 9), pharmacists (n = 9), and other health professionals that provided smoking cessation counselling (n = 21). Interviews were mostly completed by phone and online teleconferencing software. Questions focused on smoking cessation practices, advice and information provided to patients about NVPs, views about the effectiveness of the model for supporting use of NVPs for smoking cessation and preventing youth uptake, and barriers and facilitators to prescribing and dispensing NVPs. Coding and analysis used a combination of inductive and deductive approaches. RESULTS: Findings indicated a lack of consensus amongst the participants about NVPs as a cessation or harm reduction tool. Participants broadly agreed that the model has not been effective in improving quality control of NVPs, or in reducing youth access. Many participants eligible to prescribe or dispense NVPs felt that the current regulatory model placed an undue time and responsibility burden on clinicians. CONCLUSION: Our research identified several limitations associated with the current Australian prescription-only regulatory model. These were perceived by healthcare professionals to limit the potential for the regulations to reduce youth use and to increase access to safer NVP products for people who smoke to use for smoking cessation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of smoking combustible cigarettes has decreased, but rates of nicotine vaping among adolescents and young adults have increased dramatically. Vaping is associated with acute health problems and exposes users to toxic metals with unknown long-term consequences. Research on factors inﬂuencing vaping is needed to inform the development of effective prevention and intervention methods. Nicotine vaping expectancies, or expected effects related to vaping, may be an important target as they can predict vaping behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine nicotine expectancy activation patterns with corresponding nicotine vaping behaviors. METHOD: Using methods from alcohol expectancy research, we applied a memory model approach to identifying nicotine vaping expectancies and modeling organization and activation patterns concerning the frequency of nicotine vaping. We created a memory model-based nicotine expectancy measure based on information from 200 adolescents in 8th and 12th grades, and college students. Our expectancy measure was completed by a second sample of 862 college students. RESULTS: We mapped expectancies into network format using Individual Differences Scaling (INDSCAL) and we modeled likely paths of expectancy activation using Preference Mapping (PREFMAP). Nonusers primarily emphasized a positive-negative expectancy dimension and were more likely to activate expectancies of negative internal experiences about vaping. Students who vaped nicotine daily or almost daily primarily emphasized an external appearance-internal experience expectancy dimension and were more likely to activate expectancies of negative affect reduction and withdrawal relief. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify speciﬁc targets for expectancy-based prevention and intervention methods that have the potential to be as effective as similar approaches to preventing and reducing alcohol use.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare palatal wound healing of orally and systemically healthy e-cigarette users with a matched group of non-vapers. METHODS: Included were healthy adult volunteers (18-50 years), either e-cigarette users or never smokers, who agreed to use a study-specific e-cigarette device and e-liquids, and were willing to provide consent from. Exclusion criteria were: hypersensitivity to lidocaine, ASA grade >2, recent antibiotic therapy, history of periodontal surgery, active oral lesions, and carious cavities. E-cigarette users were instructed to use the device 2 times daily for more than 1 hour each, with 20 puffs per session. Bilateral 5 mm punch biopsy wounds were made palatally opposite to the 2nd premolar, and subjects were followed up at 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days post-operatively. Throughout this period, 3 mm punch biopsies were harvested from the right and left healing wounds at 1- and 3- weeks respectively. All surgical procedures were conducted by the same operator. Pre-wounding palatal biofilms were collected by swabs for metabolomic profiling. Wound healing was evaluated by clinical assessment, metabolite profile, histology, and immunohistochemistry to quantify the following proteins: vimentin, keratin and filaggrin. RESULTS: A total of 16 individuals were recruited: 8 e-cigarette users and 8 non-vapers. The average age was 27 years, and there were 4 men and 4 women in each group. The e-cigarette group tended to show a slightly lower total score of healing index in all visits compared to the control subjects, but the differences were not statistically significant. No site exhibited suppuration at any point, and no differences between groups were observed in the parameters of granulation. However, statistically significant differences were observed between groups for bleeding and swelling (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0083, respectively), but not for epithelialization and redness (p = 0.0834 and p = 0.0967, respectively). Pain on palpation and difficulty in achieving hemostasis were more prevalent in e-cigarette group. The metabolic analysis between week 1 and 3 revealed significantly elevated carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in e-cigarette users, while protein metabolism was over-represented in the control group. For immunohistochemistry, significantly lower scores of vimentin, keratin, and filaggrin were shown in the e-cigarette group compared to controls at 1 and 3 weeks (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: E-cigarettes may significantly impair oral wound healing by impacting keratinization of epithelium and modifying the metabolic composition of the oral microbiome. Therefore, vaping cannot be regarded as safe for patients undergoing oral surgery.",

AIMS AND METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study of the 2018-2019 PATH Wave 5 Youth survey, a new intensity metric of e-cigarette use, the average number of puffs per month as a function of frequency (days of use per month), number of uses per day and number of puffs per use, was developed for adolescent e-cigarette users. Using logistic regression, standard addiction measures were tested for association with higher quartile (Q) of e-cigarette intensity: Q1 (1-5 puffs), Q2 (6-50 puffs), Q3 (51-528 puffs), and Q4 (529 + puffs). RESULTS: Among 1051 current youth e-cigarette users, cravings were associated with greater intensity of use (Q2: aOR = 1.90, 95% CI: 0.94-3.87; Q3: aOR = 6.91, 95% CI: 3.25-14.69; and Q4: aOR = 21.48, 95% CI: 10.03-45.97). Craving associations exceeded the corresponding aORs for the identical regression using the frequency of use. Higher intensity was significantly associated with being an older adolescent (aOR = 1.85), best friend use (aOR: 3.35), not thinking about quitting (aOR: 2.51), and lower perceived addiction (aOR: 1.95). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that an intensity metric (puffs per month) was strongly associated with cravings, best friend use, harm perception, and lack of intention to quit. This metric provides a more accurate picture of the intensity of youth e-cigarette use than other commonly used measures and may be important for understanding the current and future impact of the youth e-cigarette epidemic. IMPLICATIONS: Adolescent addiction to e-cigarettes affects learning, memory, and attention. However, it is unknown whether the intensity of use, puffs per month, differs from frequency, days of use per month, and in relation to addiction measures. This study provides evidence that high-intensity use characterized by puffs per month has a stronger association with cravings compared to frequency, which suggests puffs per month may be a better measure of nicotine exposure. This new intensity metric may give insights into youth e-cigarette use patterns, addiction, and appropriate treatment of intense but intermittent users.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Describe the participatory research procedures of developing Kick Vaping, a vaping cessation text messaging intervention for Latino young adults, available in English and Spanish. METHODS: Using community-based recruitment strategies, we convened a Community Advisory Board (CAB) of eight Latino young adults (ages 18-25) with different vaping experiences (never users, ex-users, and current users of e-cigarettes). Members held a series of working meetings to adapt Decídetexto, a smoking cessation text messaging intervention, for vaping cessation. Members provided iterative feedback on the text messages until reaching a consensus on content. Messages were translated from English to Spanish following a committee approach. Readability assessments were used to evaluate the legibility of the text messages. RESULTS: At baseline, members' mean age was 22.6 years old (SD 3.1), 75% were female, and 50% used both English and Spanish equally. Three members (37.5%) were ex-users and one member (12.5%) was a current user of e-cigarettes. 18 meetings provided sufficient opportunities for iterative feedback on the text messages for developing the intervention. The Kick Vaping intervention consists of 208 text messages. Readability scores of the text messages in English were equivalent to fourth and fifth grade, and in Spanish were equivalent to easy and somewhat easy. CONCLUSION: It is feasible and practical to build participatory research among Latino young adults focused on vaping cessation. Members of the CAB added innovation and creativity to the development of the vaping cessation text messaging intervention. Future research is needed to evaluate the impact of the intervention on vaping cessation."

METHODS: Data was obtained from 697 treatment-seeking participants (aged 13-24 years) from a vaping cessation intervention trial conducted between February and March 2023 with This is Quitting and 665 participants who expressed intent to quit vaping in the Truth Longitudinal Cohort, a nationally representative longitudinal study of United States youth and young adults (aged 15-24 years), collected October 2022 to February 2023. Comparisons were made using two-sample Pearson Chi-square tests and t-tests. RESULTS: Treatment-seeking young people were younger, less racially diverse, more diverse in sexual orientation, and reported higher psychological distress, frequency of e-cigarette use, and nicotine dependence, relative to the nationally representative sample of young people expressing intentions to quit vaping. CONCLUSIONS: Participants enrolled in treatment reported higher levels of dependence and use frequency than the broader population, suggesting that many young e-cigarette users with lower dependence who want to quit might not be reached by current treatment dissemination efforts. The implication of these findings is that communications for vaping cessation programs may need to be adjusted to have broader appeal among young people."

There is also high interest in quitting vaping among teens and young adults. Understanding the motivation of those who want to quit vaping is important for effective intervention development. This analysis compares user-submitted reasons for quitting (RFQ) vaping from 2022 to a previous analysis from 2019 to determine whether motivations have shifted among young people. METHODS: We reviewed 2000 RFQ submissions from users who enrolled in a vaping cessation text message program in 2022. Each response was coded by ≥ 2 researchers and categorized into one of 16 themes. Findings were compared to the 2019 analysis using item-wise comparisons. RESULTS: The most frequent RFQ in 2022 were health (56.1%), social influence (15.8%), and other (11.7%). In comparison to 2019, health remained the top reason, but the rank order of all other reasons shifted. Theme prevalence changed significantly, with cost decreasing and health increasing. Among health-related sub-categories, current and mental health increased compared to 2019 submissions. DISCUSSION: RFQ among young people shifted between 2019 and 2022. We observed greater concern about current and mental health, possibly from experiencing negative health impacts from vaping or from increased awareness of these impacts. The lower prevalence of cost may reflect the widespread availability of cheaper e-cigarettes. RFQ likely change rapidly with the fluctuating e-cigarette landscape and should be considered in cessation interventions, promotional campaigns, and policy."

However, despite their growing popularity, there is a lack of comprehensive research on their potential health risks. A prominent concern is EVALI (electronic cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury), a newly recognized condition currently under intense investigation. Here, we report the case of a 24-year-old male with a history of chronic smoking e-cigarettes and vaping products heavily over the past year. He sought urgent care at the emergency room due to symptoms that had been present for seven days before seeking medical attention. These symptoms included a sudden onset of difficulty breathing at rest, an intermittent dry cough producing a small amount of greenish sputum, and occasional episodes of mild hemoptysis. Chest radiograph showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates including almost innumerable tiny interstitial nodules. Multiple lobes of the lungs were affected by consolidations and patches of ground-glass opacities in the chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) image. Throughout the following week, the patient's health showed gradual improvement with the aid of supportive measures and corticosteroid treatment. As part of the recovery plan, the patient was released with a gradually reducing regimen of oral corticosteroids and was scheduled for regular outpatient monitoring. The progression of the recovery was notable through enhancements in clinical symptoms, biological markers, and radiological findings."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tobacco endgame strategies aim to drive down population smoking rates, the success of which can be improved with public buy-in, including from populations with high smoking rates such as alcohol and other drug (AOD) service clients. This study aimed to explore acceptability of tobacco retail and nicotine reduction, and subsidised nicotine vaping to support AOD service clients following a smoking cessation attempt. METHODS: We interviewed 31 Australian AOD service clients who currently or previously smoked, following a 12-week randomised trial comparing nicotine replacement therapy with nicotine vaping product (NVP) for smoking cessation. Participants were asked how effectively three scenarios would support tobacco cessation: tobacco retailer reduction, very low-nicotine cigarette standard and subsidised NVP access. We thematically analysed participant views on how each approach would support tobacco abstinence. RESULTS: Tobacco retailer reduction raised concerns about increasing travel and accessing cigarettes from alternate sources, with generally lower acceptability, though a range of perspectives were provided. Reducing nicotine in tobacco products was described as reducing appeal of smoking and potentially increasing illicit purchases of non-reduced nicotine products. Clients of AOD services were highly accepting of subsidised NVP access for tobacco cessation, as this would partly address financial and socioeconomic barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Australian tobacco control policy should consider how these approaches impact ease and likelihood of tobacco access by AOD service clients in relation to the general population. Understanding clients' acceptability of tobacco control and endgame measures can inform how to avoid potential unintended consequences for these clients.",

      "abstract": "Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes or 'vapes') has risen rapidly among young Australians in recent years. To combat this, on 2 May 2023, the Albanese Government announced a suite of reforms to reduce the desirability and accessibility of e-cigarettes to young people-including a ban on disposable e-cigarettes, restricting flavours, colours and nicotine content and requiring pharmaceutical-like packaging. While many have welcomed this announcement, the efficacy of such reforms in reducing the availability of e-cigarettes to young people remain to be seen, particularly given the current prescription-only model has done little to curb youth vaping. We argue that, in an uncertain landscape where e-cigarettes will likely remain accessible and desirable to young people, it is critical that we also upskill, empower and arm our young people with the skills, resilience, resources and knowledge to make informed and positive health decisions so that: (i) fewer young people opt to take up vaping (primary prevention); and (ii) among those who already do vape, more seek help earlier on to reduce or cease their use before dependency develops (secondary prevention). Schools are an ideal setting for the delivery of these programs, where they can be delivered en masse, integrated into existing alcohol and other drug programs and aligned with school curricula. Skills-based school prevention programs have demonstrated significant and sustained reductions in drug-related harms up to 7 years post-intervention. For as long as vapes remain widely available, desirable and purposefully marketed towards young people, we believe our best defence is self-defence.",

However, it remains unknown which methods they use in their vaping cessation efforts. METHODS: We analyzed current (past 30-day) e-cigarette users who made ≥1 quit attempt in the past 12 months from the 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) to examine the prevalence and associations of sociodemographic factors, vaping behaviors, and harm perception with the adoption of different vaping cessation methods. RESULTS: In the 2021 NYTS, there were 1436 current vapers, and 889 (67.9%) had made a past-year quit attempt. Of those, 575 (63.7%) (weighted N = 810 000) reported they did not use any resources (unassisted quitting). Peer support (14.2%), help on the Internet (6.4%), a mobile app or text messaging (5.9%), and parent support (5.8%) were the top 4 cessation methods. Female (versus male) vapers were less likely to solicit parent support (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.2; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.1-0.5), whereas Hispanic (versus White) vapers were more likely to seek friend support (AOR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-3.9) and parent support (AOR, 2.7, 95% CI, 1.2-6.3). Those who perceived vaping to be harmful were less likely to get friend support, but more likely to use a mobile app or text messaging program. Dual users of e-cigarettes and any other tobacco product were more likely to get help from a teacher/coach or a doctor/health care provider and treatment from medical facilities than sole e-cigarette users. CONCLUSIONS: There were different correlates with the adoption of vaping cessation methods, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to meet the cessation needs and preferences of the adolescent vaping population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: E-cigarette use, or vaping, is an alternative nicotine delivery system that is becoming increasingly prevalent in adolescents and young adults. There is currently a lack of comprehensive research on the adverse effects of vaping on the upper airway. Acute epiglottitis is a potentially life-threatening condition that can lead to airway obstruction. It is commonly caused by bacterial infections such as streptococci, staphylococcus, and Moraxella. Adult patients with acute epiglottitis mainly present with odynophagia, dysphagia, and respiratory difficulties. The diagnosis of epiglottitis is made by direct laryngoscopy, and the mainstay of treatment is antibiotics. Bozella et al. (2020) reported a case of subacute non-infectious epiglottitis associated with e-cigarette use in a pediatric patient (Pediatrics 145(3), 2020). Here we present a case of acute epiglottitis in a healthy young adult after vaping, with a negative infectious workup. To our knowledge, there has been no such reported case of epiglottitis associated with e-cigarette use in an adult patient. CASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy 29-year-old male with daily e-cigarette use presented to the emergency department with a severe sore throat, dysphagia, mild hoarseness, and shortness of breath, especially when lying supine. A lateral neck soft tissue radiograph revealed a thickened epiglottis with a thumb sign. Direct bedside laryngoscopy showed a swollen epiglottis, partially obstructing the supraglottic region confirming the diagnosis of acute epiglottitis. Throat and nasal swabs were negative for streptococcus and COVID-19 infection, respectively. The patient's condition improved significantly after receiving intravenous Dexamethasone and antibiotics for 2 days. Repeat laryngoscopy showed the resolution of epiglottis swelling, and subjective symptoms had resolved entirely 2 weeks following the start of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although bacterial infections usually cause acute epiglottitis, this case presents the second report of this condition associated with vaping with negative microbiological investigations. Therefore, we recommend that physicians consider non-infectious causes such as vaping in their differential diagnosis for patients with acute and subacute epiglottitis. More research is warranted on the utility of antibiotics in treating vaping-induced epiglottitis."

However, there is a paucity of published work addressing e-cigarette cessation methods empirically, and what evidence that is available is weak. Therefore, we developed an expert informed clinical resource to guide practitioners helping their clients quit using e-cigarettes. We conducted a modified Delphi process between September and December 2021 to reach consensus on clinical recommendations for e-cigarette cessation. Expert and Peer Panel members (n = 28) voted and provided feedback on the recommendations through three rounds of structured surveys, a discussion board, and one intermediate survey. The penultimate knowledge products underwent usability testing and were finalized based on user feedback. The Expert Panel maintained a 100% response rate for rounds 1 and 2 and 96% for round 3; the Peer Panel achieved a 100% response rate for all three rounds of the modified Delphi process. Consensus was reach on 24 recommendations and 2 statements spanning eight domains: severity and dependence; general approaches; treatment approaches; dual use; pharmacotherapy strategies; behavioural therapy strategies; harm reduction; and relapse prevention. Two additional 'no agreement' statements that did not reach consensus are included in the guidance resource. The recommendations were also contextualized for the following groups: adults; youth; people who are pregnant, breastfeeding and/or chestfeeding; and people with mental illness and/or substance use issues. The recommendations listed in the resource provide general clinical guidance on e-cigarette cessation to assist healthcare practitioners in the treatment planning process."

      "abstract": "In response to rapid and substantial increases in rates of e-cigarette use among young people, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) made changes to the regulations governing nicotine vaping products. As part of the regulatory change process, Australians were invited to comment on the proposed regulations, which featured the introduction of a prescription model for nicotine vaping products. To inform strategies to enhance compliance with the tightened regulations, this study examined submissions made by self-reported e-cigarette users to the TGA's public consultation (n = 1405). A content analysis was conducted to identify and quantify key arguments. Claims about possible negative consequences associated with the regulations (e.g. people will return to smoking, inconvenience) featured in most submissions (84%). Around half (55%) of submissions mentioned perceived benefits of e-cigarettes, including favourable health outcomes (e.g. improved breathing) and enhanced tobacco cessation. Around half (52%) featured concerns about inconsistency in treatment and the argument that e-cigarettes should not be restricted when more harmful tobacco products are readily available. Alternative approaches to a prescription model were offered in nearly one-third (31%) of submissions. One-quarter (26%) included text provided by an industry-led astroturfing campaign. The arguments made in the analysed submissions suggest a lack of appreciation of (i) the negative health outcomes associated with e-cigarette use and (ii) evidence linking these devices to smoking relapse. Results highlight the need for targeted health campaigns that address (i) gaps in consumers' knowledge and (ii) vaping-related misinformation being promulgated by the industry and its allies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unacceptably high levels of e-cigarette use among youth paired with growing research about the dangers of vaping demonstrate a critical need to develop interventions that educate young people to reject e-cigarette use and promote cessation for current users. Vaping: Know the Truth (VKT) is a free digital learning experience prioritizing middle and high school students that aims to improve students' knowledge about the dangers of using e-cigarettes and provide quitting resources for those who already vape. The current study was designed to evaluate whether students receiving the curriculum increased knowledge of the dangers of vaping. METHODS: The outcome measures were calculated as the change in the number of correct responses from the pre- to post-module assessments among middle and high school students who completed four modules of the VKT curriculum (N = 103,522). Linear regression was performed to determine the association between the student's pre-module assessment score and the knowledge change score after completion of the four modules. RESULTS: Students' e-cigarette knowledge significantly improved by an average of 3.24 points (SD = 3.54), following implementation of the VKT curriculum. This indicates that participants answered more than 3 additional questions correctly, on average, after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate that the Vaping: Know the Truth curriculum is an effective resource for increasing knowledge among youth about the harms associated with e-cigarette use. Further research is needed to evaluate whether the intervention is associated with behavioral outcomes over time.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the UK, most smokers choosing e-cigarettes to quit smoking will access vaping via commercial routes. In recent years, however, a shift towards medicalisation of vaping has become apparent, with public health guidance supporting e-cigarettes for smoking cessation and increased partnership working between healthcare professionals and the vaping industry. To achieve the UK's Smokefree 2030 target, the UK Government has set out measures to use e-cigarettes in National Health Service (NHS) settings and to move towards streamlining processes to make e-cigarettes available to a million smokers. This article aims to understand acceptability of different approaches by seeking perspectives of people with lived experience of e-cigarette use for smoking cessation. METHODS: Mixed methods data collected between March 2018 and March 2019 as part of a broader study of e-cigarette use trajectories (ECtra study). Data here relate to the views of partnership working and medicalisation of vaping extracted from 136 interviews/extended surveys of people who had used e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. Participant ratings of interventions were presented descriptively, and differences in participant characteristics and ratings were reported. RESULTS: Three qualitative themes were identified: pro-partnership, anti-partnership and medicalisation dissonance. Medicalisation was discussed for its potential to reassure smokers about e-cigarette harms and its potential to reach smokers from disadvantaged backgrounds. Concerns were raised about cost-effectiveness, quality of support, conflicts of interest and limiting product choice. Most participants rated interventions involving partnership working as potentially helpful in switching from smoking to vaping. There were no statistically significant associations between age, gender and socioeconomic status, and helpfulness ratings. CONCLUSION: Both commercial and medical routes to vaping offer perceived benefits to vapers and may complement and reinforce each other to support smoking cessation."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Smoking is a global public health concern, with a significant negative impact on human health and healthcare spending. Vaping, or the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), has emerged as a popular alternative to traditional nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) for smoking cessation. While considered less harmful than combustible cigarettes, the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes (vaping) are unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to identify and provide a comprehensive overview of the performance of vaping in clinical trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A search was conducted in the ClinicalTrials.gov database on April 14th, 2023, using the search term \"smoking cessation, e-cigarettes, NRTs, and vaping\". Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined to identify relevant clinical trials. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized clinical trials that evaluated vaping as a therapeutic approach to smoking cessation were included. RESULTS: A total of 87 clinical trials were identified, of which only seven were related to smoking cessation through vaping as a form of treatment. The primary endpoint was the effect of vaping as smoking cessation, and the secondary endpoints were patients' abstinence rate, withdrawal symptoms, and adverse events of e-cigarettes. Most of the trials used e-cigarettes as an intervention, with some trials including a combination of e-cigarettes and other NRTs. The trials lasted from 4 weeks to 12 months. The overall results of the trials indicated that vaping was effective in helping smokers to quit. It was also associated with a lower risk of adverse events than combustible cigarettes. CONCLUSION: Vaping appears to be an effective method for smoking cessation, and it is associated with a lower risk of adverse events than combustible cigarettes."

METHOD: Ten real-world questions about vaping cessation were selected from a Reddit forum and used as ChatGPT prompts or queries. Content analysis was performed on the ChatGPT responses to identify the thematic aspects of vaping cessation support represented in the responses. Next, the responses were empirically evaluated by five experts in tobacco control on accuracy, quality, clarity, and empathy. RESULT: The following themes related to vaping cessation support were identified: understanding nicotine withdrawal symptoms, self-regulation, peer support, motivational support, and Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). The experts judged the ChatGPT responses to be 'satisfactory' to 'excellent' in areas of accuracy, quality, clarity, and empathy. CONCLUSION: If managed by a group of experts, including clinicians, and behavioral and computer scientists, a platform such as the ChatGPT may be leveraged to design tailored interventions for tobacco use cessation, including vaping cessation.",

      "abstract": "The tobacco epidemic has been one of the biggest public health threats, and smoking is one of the world's largest preventable causes of premature death. An estimated 15.4% of all deaths in the world are attributable to tobacco smoking. The present review aims to describe addiction to tobacco smoking and vaping. Tobacco and vaping devices contain nicotine, a highly addictive drug, which explains why smoking is so prevalent and persistent. Electronic cigarettes are a group of novel nicotine or tobacco products that have rapidly gained popularity in recent years. Electronic cigarette devices allow for the use of other drugs, including THC, while the lax regulation may allow for the introduction of toxic compounds that can lead to acute or subacute toxicity, such as the e-cigarette- or vaping-associated lung injury that has been linked to vitamin E acetate. In addition, regular vapers and heated tobacco devices emit toxins, although at lower concentrations than burned tobacco. However, more and more side effects have been identified. No new effective treatment for nicotine addiction has been developed recently, despite its huge adverse impact on overall health and other outcomes. As for the primary line of medications, the last one started in 2006, the varenicline, demonstrating a low interest in developing new medications against smoking, an unacceptable state of affairs, given the huge impact of smoking on morbidity and mortality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaping cessation is virtually unexplored. The efficacy and safety of varenicline for vaping cessation has not been studied and rigorous research is required to advance best practice and outcomes for people who use electronic cigarettes (EC) and want to quit. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of varenicline (1 mg BID, administered for 12 weeks, with follow-up to week 24) combined with vaping cessation counseling in exclusive daily EC users intending to quit vaping. METHODS: Design: Double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: The study took place at a University-run smoking cessation center. PARTICIPANTS: People who exclusively use ECs daily and intend to quit vaping. INTERVENTION: A total of 140 subjects were randomized to either varenicline (1 mg, administered twice daily for 12 weeks) plus counseling or placebo treatment (administered twice daily, for 12 weeks) plus counseling. The trial consisted of a 12-week treatment phase followed by a 12-week follow-up, nontreatment phase. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was biochemically validated continuous abstinence rate (CAR) at weeks 4 to 12. Secondary efficacy end points were CAR at weeks 4 to 24 and 7-day point prevalence of vaping abstinence at weeks 12 and 24. RESULTS: CAR was significantly higher for varenicline vs placebo at each interval: weeks 4-12, 40.0% and 20.0%, respectively (OR = 2.67, 95% CI = [1.25-5.68], P = 0.011); weeks 4-24, 34.3% for varenicline with counseling and 17.2% for placebo with counseling (OR = 2.52, 95% CI = [1.14-5.58], P = 0.0224). The 7-day point prevalence of vaping abstinence was also higher for the varenicline than placebo at each time point. Serious adverse events were infrequent in both groups and not treatment-related. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present RCT indicate that inclusion of varenicline in a vaping cessation program for people who use electronic cigarettes and intending to quit may result in prolonged abstinence. These positive findings establish a benchmark of intervention effectiveness, may support the use of varenicline combined with counseling in vaping cessation programs, and may also help guiding future recommendations by health authorities and healthcare providers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study has been registered in EUDRACT with Trial registration ID: 2016-000339-42.",

There is an urgent need for clinical information about e-cigarette users to identify factors that contribute to EVALI. We developed an e-cigarette/vaping assessment tool (EVAT) that was integrated into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) of a large state-wide medical system and initiated a system-wide dissemination and education to support its use. METHODS: EVAT documented current vaping status, history, and e-cigarette content (nicotine, cannabinoids, and/or flavoring). Educational materials and presentations were developed via a comprehensive literature review. EVAT utilization in the EHR was assessed quarterly. Patients' demographic data and clinical site name were also collected. RESULTS: The EVAT was built, validated, and integrated with the EHR in July 2020. Live and virtual seminars were conducted for prescribing providers and clinical staff. Asynchronous training was offered using podcasts, e-mails, and Epic tip sheets. Participants were informed about vaping harm and EVALI and instructed on the use of EVAT. As of December 31, 2022, EVAT was used 988,181 times, with 376,559 unique patients evaluated. Overall, 1,063 hospital units and affiliated ambulatory clinics used EVAT, including 64 Primary Care, 95 Pediatrics, and 874 Specialty sites. CONCLUSIONS: EVAT was successfully implemented. Continued outreach efforts are needed to further increase its usage. Education materials should be enhanced to help providers to reach youth and vulnerable populations and connect patients to the tobacco treatment resources.",

      "abstract": "Given the rise of communication campaigns to prevent and reduce the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems among minors nationwide, it is important to examine whether certain preventive messages will spill over to affect current adult smokers' support for and compliance with vaping regulations. Drawing upon the Moral Foundations Theory, the current study experimentally examined the effects of moral frames on current adult smokers' support for vape-free policies and marketing restrictions. An online sample of current smokers (N = 630) was randomly assigned to a 3 (moral frames in vaping prevention : care, purity, non-moral control) × 2 (priming of anti-smoking messages: yes or no) between-subject survey experiment. Compared with non-moral framed messages, smokers exposed to both care and purity framed messages were more likely to support vape-free policies in public places. Such effects were stronger for smokers with higher pre-treatment endorsement of the purity value, driven less by anger or disgust but more by smokers' updating of both self-oriented and secondhand harm perceptions. Moral frames, especially those appealing to care and purity moral values, are thus promising messaging strategies for vaping prevention communication campaigns in terms of increasing current smokers' support for vape-free policies. The results also help improve our understanding of the moral roots of health policy opinions and the potential of deploying moral framing to improve message design for health campaigns.",

In this prospective cohort study, we aimed to identify the different predictors of vaping dependence over 3 months among adolescents who were baseline daily and non-daily vapers. We recruited ever-vaping Canadian residents aged 16-25 years on social media platforms and asked them to complete a baseline survey in November 2020. A validated vaping dependence score (0-23) summing up their responses to nine questions was calculated at the 3-month follow-up survey. Separate lasso regression models were developed to identify predictors of higher 3-month vaping dependence score among baseline daily and non-daily vapers. Of the 1172 participants, 643 (54.9%) were daily vapers with a mean age of 19.6 ± 2.6 years and 76.4% (n = 895) of them being female. The two models achieved adequate predictive performance. Place of last vape purchase, number of days a pod lasts, and the frequency of nicotine-containing vaping were the most important predictors for dependence among daily vapers, while race, sexual orientation and reporting treatment for heart disease were the most important predictors in non-daily vapers. These findings have implications for vaping control policies that target adolescents at different stages of vape use."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Electronic smoking devices were created, and their production industrialized, recently. Since their creation, their use has spread widely. This increase in users led to the appearance of a new lung condition. In 2019, the CDC established the criteria for the diagnosis of electronic cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) and the eponym EVALI is now widely recognized. The condition results from the inhalation of heated vapor, which damages the large and small airways and alveoli. CASE REPORT This report presents the case of a 43-year-old Brazilian man with acute impairment of lung function, pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography (CT) and features of EVALI. He was hospitalized after 9 days of respiratory symptoms due to worsening dyspnea, and underwent a bronchoscopy on the same day. His condition evolved into severe hypercapnic respiratory failure that took 3 weeks to improve, and he underwent a surgical lung biopsy that showed an organizing pneumonia pattern. He was discharged after 50 days of hospitalization. Infectious diseases and other lung conditions were ruled out on clinical, laboratory, radiological, epidemiological, and histopathological grounds. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we report the unusual presentation of EVALI on chest CT showing nodules instead of a ground-glass pattern, as stated in the CDC definitions of a confirmed case. We also report the progression to a critical clinical state and, after treatment, the evolution to complete recovery. We also draw attention to the difficulties in diagnosing and managing the disease, especially at a time when COVID-19 has emerged.",

Study aims were to develop and conduct initial psychometric analyses on the Protective Behavioral Strategies for Vaping (PBSV) scale to measure strategies that students use before, during, after, and instead of vaping to protect themselves from vaping-related harms. METHODS: Students from one U.S. university (n = 277) completed an online survey and provided open-ended reports on things they do to avoid vaping and limit their use while vaping. Responses were used to generate an item pool of 52 strategies. Students from a second sample who vaped in the past year (n = 216) were administered these 52 items. A series of exploratory graph, unique variable, and exploratory factor analyses were used to develop and test the psychometric properties of the PBSV. RESULTS: The finalized scale contained 39 items, which featured three subscales reflecting manner of use, avoiding use by creating obstacles, and committing to quitting and using supports to quit. The PBSV composite score and each subscale negatively associated with vaping frequency and dependence. Males endorsed significantly lower scores for manner of use than females. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory and preliminary examination of the PBSV scale's psychometric properties suggests that use of protective strategies for vaping may protect young people from more frequent use and greater dependence. More research with the PBSV scale is encouraged to determine its psychometric properties and potential practical utility as a clinical and assessment tool with young adults.",

      "abstract": "This review provides an overview of potential vaping-cessation interventions in adult former smokers. The interventions reviewed include varenicline, bupropion, nicotine-replacement therapies (NRTs), and behavioural therapy. Evidence for intervention effectiveness is provided when available, such as for varenicline, whereas recommendations for bupropion and NRT are extrapolated from case studies or smoking-cessation guidelines. The limitations of these interventions, a general lack of prospective studies, and a discussion of challenges to vaping safety from a public health perspective are also discussed. Although these interventions show promise, further research is needed to establish precise protocols and dosages in the context of vaping cessation, rather than adapting existing recommendations from smoking cessation.",
