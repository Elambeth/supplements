      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This prospective, triple blind randomized clinical trial aims to specifically evaluate the effect of Aluneb® (hyaluronic acid plus xilitol) in the postoperative treatment of inferior turbinate radiofrequency in adults compared to nebulized isotonic saline. METHODS: Adults undergoing radiofrequency turbinate ablation were included. Treatment group received Aluneb® (hyaluronic acid plus xylitol) while the control group received nebulized isotonic saline for two months after treatment. Participants were studied the week before surgery (visit 0), and at 7, 15, 30 and 60 days after surgery. At all visits, participants underwent physical examination, rhinomanometry, SNOT-22, and visual analogue scale (VAS) of symptoms. RESULTS: 34 participants were recruited. Crusts (endoscopy) were less in the Aluneb® hyaluronic acid plus xylitol group. Nasal crusting, epistaxis and nasal obstruction VAS were statistically significant lower. VAS for Rhinorrea, halitosis, cacosmia and pain and nasal resistance obtained lower self-reported values in the hyaluronic acid plus xilitol group, but these differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Hyaluronic acid plus xilitol demonstrated promise in improving postoperative outcomes, future studies with larger sample sizes and different surgical techniques are encouraged."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a global healthcare issue, with its incidence continuing to rise, but currently there is no complete cure. Xylitol is a widely used sweetener in various foods and beverages, but there is limited research on the effects of xylitol on IBD symptoms. AIM: Study on the effect of oral xylitol in improving intestinal inflammation and damage in IBD mice, further explore the mechanism of xylitol in alleviating IBD symptoms using intestinal microbiota and non-targeted metabolomics techniques. METHODS: An IBD mouse model was induced using sodium dextran sulfate (DSS). After 30 days of oral administration of xylitol, we assessed the disease activity index (DAI) scores of mice in each group. The expression levels of inflammatory factors in the colon tissues were measured using qPCR. Additionally, we examined the damage to the intestinal mucosa and tight junction structures through HE staining and immunohistochemical staining. Finally, the alterations in the gut microbiota of the mice were analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing technology.The production of three main short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, including acetate, propionic acid and butyric acid) in feces and the changes of serum metabolomics were measured by non-targeted metabolomics techniques. RESULTS: The findings indicated that xylitol effectively mitigated weight loss and improved the DAI score in mice with IBD. Moreover, xylitol reduced the expressions of Caspase-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the colon tissue of the mice, and increased the expressions of ZO-1 and occludin in intestinal mucosal. Xylitol could enhance the variety of intestinal bacteria in IBD mice and influenced the abundance of different bacterial species. Additionally, metabolomic analysis revealed that oral xylitol increased the levels of three main SCFAs in the feces of IBD mice, while also impacting serum metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that xylitol can help improve IBD symptoms. Xylitol can improve the intestinal flora of IBD mice and increase the production of SCFAs to play an anti-inflammatory role and protect the mucosal tight junction barrier. These discoveries present a fresh prophylactic treatment of IBD. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Fixed orthodontic appliances are associated with higher levels of plaque and saliva bacteria, which contribute to dental caries. The effects of combining xylitol and fluoride, both used in caries prevention, are uncertain. Thus, this study assessed the combined impact of fluoride and xylitol varnish on bacteria in saliva and biofilms around orthodontic brackets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, four-arm, parallel-group, triple-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted. A total of 120 patients who required fixed orthodontic treatment were included. Patients were sorted into one of the following groups at random: fluoride, xylitol, combined fluoride and xylitol, and control. Biofilm and saliva sampling was performed at two intervals: T0 (first session of bracket bonding, before application of the varnish) and T1 (6 weeks after application of the varnish). The number of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus was counted using the CFU method. RESULTS: The relative number of S. mutans and lactobacilli in saliva and biofilm significantly decreased following the application of fluoride and combined fluoride/xylitol varnish (p < 0.05) and were more effective than xylitol varnish. There was no significant difference between fluoride and combined fluoride/xylitol varnishes regarding changes in S. mutans and Lactobacillus colonies in saliva and dental biofilms. Additionally, there was no significant difference between xylitol and the two other active varnishes regarding reduction in biofilm S. mutans and Lactobacillus. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between fluoride and combined fluoride/xylitol varnishes regarding changes in the studied bacteria in saliva and dental biofilms, and they were more effective than xylitol varnish.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim in the present study was to evaluate the effects of chewing postoperative xylitol gum on gastrointestinal functional recovery after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. DESIGN: A three-arm randomized controlled trial. METHODS: After a baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned in three groups. The random assignment was performed by using a computer program (Microsoft Excel 2016). Afterward, participants were categorized into three subgroups. Group 3 was the control group that consisted of participants who had no intervention for chewing gum (n = 25). Group 2 was xylitol-free gum chewing group (n = 25), whereas Group 1 was xylitol gum chewing group (n = 24). In later phases, the time to first postsurgical flatus, time to first bowel sound after surgery, time to first postsurgical defecation, time to first mobilization after surgery, and discharge time from hospital were recorded. Nausea and vomiting, which are among the postoperative symptoms, were also evaluated. FINDINGS: The duration of the control group from the end of surgery to the flatulence and bowel sounds was statistically higher than the xylitol group and xylitol-free group (all P < .05). Also, first postoperative flatulence time of xylitol-free group was higher than the xylitol group (P < .05). The duration from the end of surgery to defecation was longer in the control group compared with the xylitol group and the xylitol-free group, with a statistically significant difference between the groups (P < .05). In this study, a statistically significant difference was observed in terms of the time to first postsurgical flatus, time to first bowel sound after surgery, and time to first postsurgical defecation (all P < .000). No significant difference was found between the xylitol group, xylitol-free group, and control group when discharge from hospital and mobilization times were analyzed (all of them are P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing xylitol gum facilitates postoperative gastrointestinal recovery after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further studies are recommended to confirm these findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms."

In this study, we investigated the production of d-xylitol from l-arabinose derived from sugar beet press pulp (SBPP) hydrolysate using an engineered Aspergillus niger strain. Initial batch studies applying stirred tank bioreactors demonstrated d-xylitol production of 4.6 g L-1 with a yield of 0.37 g d-xylitol g-1 l-arabinose with a synthetic medium. Subsequently, the conversion of enzymatically produced and clarified SBPP hydrolysate was studied. We found that pre-treatment of the enzymatic hydrolysate with activated carbon was essential to remove inhibitory components. Moreover, an automated aeration switch-off was implemented based on the CO2 signal of the off-gas analyzer of the stirred tank bioreactor to prevent d-xylitol degradation after l-arabinose depletion. This resulted in a final d-xylitol concentration of 4.3 g L-1 with an improved yield of 0.43 g d-xylitol g-1 l-arabinose. The feasibility of utilizing the agricultural residue SBPP for d-xylitol production was successfully demonstrated with engineered A. niger."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: During fixed orthodontic treatment, oral hygiene is difficult to ensure and can easily lead to an imbalance in the oral micro-ecological balance. In this study, based on the adhesive properties of polydopamine (PDA) and the good antimicrobial and remineralization properties of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and xylitol (Xy), new nanocomposites with both antimicrobial and remineralization capabilities were prepared to coat on orthodontic brackets. METHODS: Composite carbon dots (CDs) were synthesized using carboxymethyl chitosan and xylitol, we characterized them and the antimicrobial properties of the CMC-Xy-CDs were investigated by co-cultivation with S. mutans in vitro and in vivo. The composite coating was then adhered to the brackets. After the characterization measurements, antibacterial properties against S. mutans and the ability to promote remineralization of isolated teeth were investigated. RESULTS: Biological studies demonstrated that L929 cells co-cultured with CMC-Xy-CDs did not observe significant cytotoxicity and CMC-Xy-CDs have good biocompatibility. In the adhesive action of PDA, various characterizations have proved that CDs are modified on the brackets surface. In the antibacterial experiment, CMC-Xy-CDs and the adhesive coating on the brackets were found to have better antibacterial performance than the control group, with an antibacterial rate of up to 80%. In the animal experiment, the results of CMC-Xy-CDs promoting the healing of S. mutans infection wound models showed that there was a significant difference at 7d (P < 0.001), indicating that the experimental group had good antibacterial effects. The SEM of teeth after CMC-Xy-CDs promoted remineralization showed that the structure of the tooth surface became dense and some precipitation appeared, and the surface hardness measurement was significantly increased (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that new nanocomposites with both antimicrobial and remineralization capabilities coated on orthodontic brackets provide a good basis for future clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Dental plaque provides a proper environment for the growth and activity of bacteria responsible for periodontal diseases and caries. As a result, it should be removed by individuals to prevent periodontal diseases and caries. There are different mechanical and chemical plaque control methods. In one study is shown that dental plaque removal efficacy of dentifrice containing Ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid(EDTA)/Methylsulfonylmethane(MSM) was nearly five times that of commercially available fluoride toothpaste. In another study, authors found that xylitol-containing chewing gums caused a marked reduction in the count of Streptococcus Mutans compared to conventional ones. This difference was highly prominent in individuals with poor oral hygiene. In this study we assessed the synergic effects of Xylitol, EDTA and MSM in a chewing gum in comparison with chlorhexidine mouthwash. This study was a crossover, randomized clinical trial. Twenty-four patients were divided in two groups randomly. At the baseline scaling and root planing was done for each patient. Group1 used chlorhexidine mouthwash twice a day. Group2 used novel chewing gum for 15 min twice a day. After 14 days, for every patient O'leary plaque index, gingival index and sulcus bleeding index were reevaluated and recorded. Professional brushing was done for patients. 14 days were considered as wash-out period. After that, method of plaque control of groups was changed. After 14 days, all patients were reevaluated and recorded and were compared with previous data. Samples in 2 groups had no significant difference in age and sex. Paired sample t test revealed that there were significant differences between first and second period for O'leary plaque index, gingival index and sulcus bleeding index in Group1 (P < 0.05). But in Group2 there were no differences between first and second period for all indexes. Also independent sample t test showed that there were no significant differences between baseline, after first treatment and after second one for all indexes in both groups (P > 0.05). According to regression model results, type of treatment had no effect on mean of all indexes. According to our findings which showed the similar efficiency of novel chewing gum and chlorhexidine mouthwash in improving and reducing plaque and gingival indexes, we can conclude that novel chewing gum can be introduced as an effective, cheap and accessible tool for dental plaque control.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal periodontal disease is associated with preterm and low-birthweight deliveries, but randomized trials of likely efficacious treatments (e.g., dental scaling and root planing) during pregnancy have not reduced these adverse outcomes. As an alternative, we hypothesized that periconception initiation of xylitol chewing gum would reduce the occurrence of preterm or low-birthweight deliveries among a historical high-prevalence population in Malawi. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, parallel-enrollment, matched-pair, cluster-randomized, controlled clinical trial across eight health centers (sites) in and around Lilongwe, Malawi. Sites were paired by anticipated delivery volume and randomized to prenatal and oral health education alone (active control) or with twice-daily xylitol chewing gum (intervention) throughout the periconception and antenatal periods. For the primary prevention of preterm (<37 weeks) and low-birthweight (<2,500 g) deliveries (co-primary outcomes), comparison by allocation group was performed using generalized linear mixed models for each outcome as a fixed factor and the site(s) as a random factor. FINDINGS: 10,069 participants were enrolled (n = 4,549 at intervention sites, n = 5,520 at active control sites), with >95% available for analyses. Initiation of xylitol chewing gum resulted in significant reductions in the co-primary outcomes: preterm birth (12.6% [549/4,349] vs. 16.5% [878/5,321]; relative risk [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.99) and <2,500-g neonates (8.9% [385/4,305] vs. 12.9% [679/5,260]; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49-0.99). Xylitol chewing gum use also led to fewer neonatal demises (0.2% [8/4,305] vs. 0.4% [22/5,260]; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Periconception initiation and ongoing use of xylitol chewing gum significantly reduced the occurrence of preterm and low-birthweight deliveries in Malawi. FUNDING: E.W.

Xylitol concentrations of 2, 1, and 0.5 M reduced biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and the mixed-species biofilm in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, biofilms formed by these species were subjected to treatment with xylitol. Xylitol was also capable of eradicating biofilms established by P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and the mixed-species biofilm by at least 20%, with the most effective eradication observed for P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. The present study indicates the effectiveness of xylitol as both an inhibitory and eradicating agent against biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and a mix of both species in an alginate bead model, which mimics the in vivo characteristics of P. aeruginosa aggregates.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The pathways and metabolites that contribute to residual cardiovascular disease risks are unclear. Low-calorie sweeteners are widely used sugar substitutes in processed foods with presumed health benefits. Many low-calorie sweeteners are sugar alcohols that also are produced endogenously, albeit at levels over 1000-fold lower than observed following consumption as a sugar substitute. METHODS: Untargeted metabolomics studies were performed on overnight fasting plasma samples in a discovery cohort (n = 1157) of sequential stable subjects undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac evaluations; subsequent stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses were performed on an independent, non-overlapping validation cohort (n = 2149). Complementary isolated human platelet, platelet-rich plasma, whole blood, and animal model studies examined the effect of xylitol on platelet responsiveness and thrombus formation in vivo. Finally, an intervention study was performed to assess the effects of xylitol consumption on platelet function in healthy volunteers (n = 10). RESULTS: In initial untargeted metabolomics studies (discovery cohort), circulating levels of a polyol tentatively assigned as xylitol were associated with incident (3-year) major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) risk. Subsequent stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS analyses (validation cohort) specific for xylitol (and not its structural isomers) confirmed its association with incident MACE risk [third vs. first tertile adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 1.57 (1.12-2.21), P < .01]. Complementary mechanistic studies showed xylitol-enhanced multiple indices of platelet reactivity and in vivo thrombosis formation at levels observed in fasting plasma. In interventional studies, consumption of a xylitol-sweetened drink markedly raised plasma levels and enhanced multiple functional measures of platelet responsiveness in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Xylitol is associated with incident MACE risk. Moreover, xylitol both enhanced platelet reactivity and thrombosis potential in vivo. Further studies examining the cardiovascular safety of xylitol are warranted.",

Reference lists of relevant systematic reviews were hand searched for other eligible studies for inclusion. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled clinical trials and controlled clinical trials conducted on children (aged ≤ 18 years), conducted between 1974-2022 and available in English, were eligible for inclusion. Studies were excluded if caries was not an outcome, the control group was not sufficient, they were lab-based studies or studies where xylitol delivery was not a sweet or chewing gum and where the xylitol product contained a component such as fluoride which may influence the outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Four calibrated reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, and disagreements were resolved via group discussion. Preventative effect was determined by comparing the mean caries increment in the control and intervention groups, producing a preventative fraction. A total of 617 titles were initially screened for relevance. After duplicate removal, 268 abstracts were screened and 16 full text articles reviewed, with one more study then excluded. 10 studies investigated xylitol-containing chewing gum, and six looked at xylitol candy (one did both). Eight included studies were randomised controlled trials. Data extraction was undertaken by two reviewers. RESULTS: 3466 participants were included in the 10 studies that investigated xylitol chewing gum, and all 10 studies reported a statistically significant preventive effect compared to a no chewing gum or placebo control. In 9 studies, the preventive fraction was clinically significant. The six studies investigating xylitol candies contained a total of 1023 participants, and only one study demonstrated a significant preventative effect. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that incorporating xylitol chewing gum daily has a caries-reducing effect in those with a moderate-to-high baseline caries level. This effect was not present for xylitol sweets.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The human gut microbiota is composed of many viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Escherichia coli representatives are facultative anaerobic bacteria in the colon that play a crucial role in the metabolism of lactose, vitamin synthesis, and immune system modulation. E. coli forms a biofilm on the epithelial cell surface of the intestine that can be modified by diet compounds, i.e., gluten, xylitol, lactose, and probiotics. METHODS: In the present study, the impact of probiotic-derived Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG strain on non-pathogenic E. coli biofilm was examined. The mono- and multispecies biofilm was also treated with gluten, xylitol, and lactose. We used 96-well plates to obtain biofilm growth. Biofilm was stained using crystal violet. To evaluate the type of interaction in mono- and multispecies biofilm, a new formula was introduced: biofilm interaction ratio index (BIRI). To describe the impact of nutrients on biofilm formation, the biofilm formation impact ratio (BFIR) was calculated. RESULTS: The biofilms formed by both examined species are stronger than in monocultures. All the BIRI values were above 3.0. It was found that the monospecies biofilm of L. rhamnosus is strongly inhibited by gluten (84.5%) and the monospecies biofilm of E. coli by xylitol (85.5%). The mixed biofilm is inhibited by lactose (78.8%) and gluten (90.6%). CONCLUSION: The relations between bacteria in the mixed biofilm led to changes in biofilm formation by E. coli and L. rhamnosus GG. Probiotics might be helpful in rebuilding the gut microbiota after broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, but only if gluten and lactose are excluded from diet.",

METHODS: The B16F10 syngeneic model consisted of 6-8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice subcutaneously injected with five × 105 B16F10 cells suspended in 100 μl PBS in the right flank. The mice were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 was the treatment group with 10% xylitol-loaded pumps (n=10), while Group 2 was the control group with saline-loaded pumps (n=10). Alzet minipumps were implanted subcutaneously in the left flank of B16F10-injected mice once more than 50% of all mice developed palpable tumors. After pump implantation surgery, the mice were monitored daily and weighed 2-3x/week. Tumor sizes were measured with calipers 2-3x/week, and all mice were euthanized when their tumors became too large (20 mm on any axis or 2,000 mm3). The excised tumors were weighed and cut in half, with one half sent for histology and the other for metabolomic analysis. RESULTS: The xylitol-treated group survived substantially longer than the control group. The tumor size was reduced by approximately 35% by volume. Histological sections of xylitol treat mice suggested reduced infiltration and angiogenesis, which is consistent with previous studies. The metabolomic analysis demonstrates that xylitol reduces the tumor production of histamine, NADP+, ATP, and glutathione from the tumor, thereby improving the host immune response with ROS reactive oxygen species. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that xylitol has potential as an adjunct to oncological treatment and is being further investigated in comparison to monoclonal antibody therapy (Opdualag)."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Previous studies in humans and rats suggest that erythritol might positively affect vascular function, xylitol decrease visceral fat mass and both substances improve glycaemic control. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of a 5-week intake of erythritol and xylitol on vascular function, abdominal fat and blood lipids, glucose tolerance, uric acid, hepatic enzymes, creatinine, gastrointestinal tolerance and dietary patterns in humans with obesity. METHODS: Forty-two participants were randomised to consume either 36 g erythritol, 24 g xylitol, or no substance daily for 5 weeks. Before and after the intervention, arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, arteriolar-to-venular diameter ratio), abdominal fat (liver volume, liver fat percentage, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, blood lipids), glucose tolerance (glucose and insulin concentrations), uric acid, hepatic enzymes, creatinine, gastrointestinal tolerance and dietary patterns were assessed. Data were analysed by linear mixed effect model. RESULTS: The 5-week intake of erythritol and xylitol showed no statistically significant effect on vascular function. Neither the time nor the treatment effects were significantly different for pulse wave velocity (time effect: p=0.079, Cohen's D (95% CI) -0.14 (-0.54-0.25); treatment effect: p=0.792, Cohen's D (95% CI) control versus xylitol: -0.11 (-0.61-0.35), control versus erythritol: 0.05 (0.44-0.54), erythritol versus xylitol: 0.07 (-0.41-0.54)). There was no statistically significant effect on abdominal fat, glucose tolerance, uric acid, hepatic enzymes and creatinine. Gastrointestinal tolerance was good except for a few diarrhoea-related symptoms. Participants of all groups reduced their consumption of sweetened beverages and sweets compared with preintervention. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-week intake of erythritol and xylitol showed no statistically significant effects on vascular function, abdominal fat, or glucose tolerance in people with obesity.

      "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a typical pathological change from chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal failure, which presents significant challenges in prevention and treatment. The progression of renal fibrosis is closely associated with the \"gut-kidney axis,\" therefore, although clinical intervention to modulate the \"gut-kidney axis\" imbalance associated with renal fibrosis brings hope for its treatment. In this study, we first identified the close relationship between renal fibrosis development and the intestinal microenvironment through fecal microtransplantation and non-absorbable antibiotics experiments. Then, we analyzed the specific connection between the intestinal microenvironment and renal fibrosis using microbiomics and metabolomics, screening for the differential intestinal metabolite. Potential metabolite action targets were initially identified through network simulation of molecular docking and further verified by molecular biology experiment. We used flow cytometry, TUNEL apoptosis staining, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting to assess renal injury and fibrosis extent, exploring the potential role of gut microbial metabolite in renal fibrosis development. We discovered that CKD-triggered alterations in the intestinal microenvironment exacerbate renal injury and fibrosis. When metabolomic analysis was combined with experiments in vivo, we found that the differential metabolite xylitol delays renal injury and fibrosis development. We further validated this hypothesis at the cellular level. Mechanically, bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) protein exhibits strong binding with xylitol, and xylitol alleviates renal fibrosis by inhibiting BRD4 and its downstream transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway. In summary, our findings suggest that the natural intestinal metabolite xylitol mitigates renal fibrosis by inhibiting the BRD4-regulated TGF-β pathway.",

METHODS: Electronic and hand searches were performed to find clinical studies on the effects of xylitol chewing gums and candies on dental caries in children (≤ 18 years). Prospective randomised or controlled clinical trials published before 2023 were included in the review. RESULTS: The initial search identified 365 titles to be evaluated. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles with either fair or low quality were reviewed. Nine articles studied chewing gums, five candies, and one both of them. In the ten evaluated xylitol chewing gum studies xylitol consumption significantly reduced caries occurrence when compared with no treatment or a placebo polyol gum. The effect was clinically significant in studies with high or moderate caries level at study baseline. The results also suggested that the caries-reducing effect of xylitol gums may differ from sorbitol/polyol gums. In five of the six heterogenous xylitol candy studies, no caries-reducing effect was found independent of caries level. In addition to caries level, also the daily xylitol dose was a confounding factor. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that the caries-reducing effect of adding xylitol chewing gum to the daily diet has been well demonstrated in children and adolescents with high or moderate caries level at study baseline. Xylitol gum use could benefit subjects with active incipient caries lesions on smooth tooth surfaces.",

      "abstract": "Cellulosic bioethanol production generally has a higher operating cost due to relatively expensive pretreatment strategies and low efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. The production of other high-value chemicals such as xylitol and phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) is, thus, necessary to offset the cost and promote economic viability. The optimal conditions of diluted sulfuric acid pretreatment under boiling water at 95°C and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis steps for sugarcane bagasse (SCB), rice straw (RS), and corn cob (CC) were optimized using the response surface methodology via a central composite design to simplify the process on the large-scale production. The optimal pretreatment conditions (diluted sulfuric acid concentration (% w/v), treatment time (min)) for SCB (3.36, 113), RS (3.77, 109), and CC (3.89, 112) and the optimal enzymatic hydrolysis conditions (pretreated solid concentration (% w/v), hydrolysis time (h)) for SCB (12.1, 93), RS (10.9, 61), and CC (12.0, 90) were achieved. CC xylose-rich and CC glucose-rich hydrolysates obtained from the respective optimal condition of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis steps were used for xylitol and ethanol production. The statistically significant highest (p ≤ 0.05) xylitol and ethanol yields were 65% ± 1% and 86% ± 2% using Candida magnoliae TISTR 5664. C. magnoliae could statistically significantly degrade (p ≤ 0.05) the inhibitors previously formed during the pretreatment step, including up to 97% w/w hydroxymethylfurfural, 76% w/w furfural, and completely degraded acetic acid during the xylitol production. This study was the first report using the mixed whole cells harvested from xylitol and ethanol production as a biocatalyst in PAC biotransformation under a two-phase emulsion system (vegetable oil/1 M phosphate (Pi) buffer). PAC concentration could be improved by 2-fold compared to a single-phase emulsion system using only 1 M Pi buffer."

      "abstract": "Xylitol is a pentose-polyol widely applied in the food and pharmaceutical industry. It can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass, valorizing second-generation feedstocks. Biotechnological production of xylitol requires scalable solutions suitable for industrial scale processes. Immobilized-cells systems offer numerous advantages. Although fungal pellet carriers have gained attention, their application in xylitol production remains unexplored. In this study, the yeast strain P. fermentans WC 1507 was employed for xylitol production. The optimal conditions were observed with free-cell cultures at pH above 3.5, low oxygenation, and medium containing (NH4)2SO4 and yeast extract as nitrogen sources (xylitol titer 79.4 g/L, YP/S 66.3%, and volumetric productivity 1.3 g/L/h). Yeast cells were immobilized using inactive Aspergillus oryzae pellet mycelial carrier (MC) and alginate beads (AB) and were tested in flasks over three consecutive production runs. Additionally, the effect of a 0.2% w/v alginate layer, coating the outer surface of the carriers (cMC and cAB, respectively), was examined. While YP/S values observed with both immobilized and free cells were similar, the immobilized cells exhibited lower final xylitol titer and volumetric productivity, likely due to mass transfer limitations. AB and cAB outperformed MC and cMC. The uncoated AB carriers were tested in a laboratory-scale airlift bioreactor, which demonstrated a progressive increase in xylitol production in a repeated batch process: in the third run, a xylitol titer of 63.0 g/L, YP/S of 61.5%, and volumetric productivity of 0.52 g/L/h were achieved. This study confirmed P. fermentans WC 1507 as a promising strain for xylitol production in both free- and entrapped-cells systems. Considering the performance of the wild strain, a metabolic engineering intervention aiming at further improving the efficiency of xylitol production could be justified. MC and AB proved to be viable supports for cell immobilization, but additional process development is necessary to identify the optimal bioreactor configuration and fermentation conditions."

      "abstract": "Reflux esophagitis, a treatment for gastric ulcers known as Ilaprazole (Ila), is not stable during storage and handling at room temperature, requiring storage at 5 degrees Celsius. In this study, to address these issues with Ila, coformers rich in oxygen (O) and hydroxyl (OH) groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds with were selected. These coformers included Xylitol (Xyl), Meglumine (Meg), Nicotinic acid (Nic), L-Aspartic acid (Asp), and L-Glutamic acid (Glu). A 1:1 physical mixture of Ila and each coformer was prepared, and the potential for cocrystal formation was predicted using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) screening. The results indicated the potential for cocrystal formation in the Ila/Xyl physical mixture. Subsequently, Ila and Xyl were mixed in ethyl acetate (EA) in a 1:1 ratio, and after 28 h of slurry, the formation of Ila/Xyl cocrystal was confirmed through solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR spectrum analysis, showing intermolecular hydrogen bonding and conformational changes. Furthermore, the 1:1 ratio of Ila/Xyl cocrystal was confirmed through solution-state NMR (1H, 13C, and 2D) molecular structure analysis. To assess the stability of Ila/Xyl cocrystal at room temperature, it was stored and compared with Ila at 25 ± 2 °C and relative humidity (RH) of 65 ± 5% over three months. The results showed that the purity of Ila/Xyl cocrystal remained at 99.8% from the initial purity of 99.75% over the three months, while Ila was predicted to decrease from an initial 99.8% purity to 90% after three months. Additionally, at 25 ± 2 °C and RH 65 ± 5%, a specific impurity B in Ila/Xyl cocrystal was observed to be 0.03% over three months, whereas Ila was predicted to increase from an initial 0.032% to 2.28% after three months. To evaluate the dissolution rate of Ila/Xyl cocrystal, a formulation was prepared and compared with Ila at pH 10, with a dosage equivalent to 10 mg of Ila. The results showed that Ila/Xyl cocrystal reached 55% within 15 min and 100% within 45 min, while Ila was predicted to reach 32% at 15 min and 100% only after 60 min. However, overall, the Ila/Xyl cocrystal showed results equivalent to or exceeding the dissolution rate of Ila. Therefore, it is predicted that the Ila/Xyl cocrystal will maximize its effectiveness as a more convenient crystal structure for formulation development, allowing storage and preservation at room temperature without the need for the problematic 5 °C refrigeration during ambient conditions and storage, addressing the issues associated with Ila."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effect of xylitol combined or not with fluoride (F) on reduction of demineralization and increase of remineralization of shallow and deep artificial enamel lesions. METHODS: Bovine enamel samples were allocated to the following solutions groups: no xylitol (negative control), 5% xylitol, 10% xylitol, 20% xylitol, 500 ppm F (as NaF), 5% xylitol+F, 10% xylitol+F or 20% xylitol+F (n = 12-15). For the demin study, a pH-cycling model (demineralization-6 h, pH 4.7/remineralization 18 h, pH 7.0) was employed for 7 days. Treatments were applied 2 × 1 min. In the remin study, specimens were pre-demineralized for 2, 5 or 10 days. Afterwards, a pH-cycling protocol was conducted (2 h demineralizing and 22 h remineralizing solution/day for 8 days) and the same treatments were done. The response variables were percentage surface hardness loss (%SHL) and transverse microradiography. Data were analyzed by RM ANOVA/Tukey or Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn (p < 0.05) RESULTS: F and Xylitol combined with F reduced the %SHL (23-30%) compared to the negative control (61.5%). The integrated mineral loss and the lesion depth were not reduced by any treatment. Surface hardness recovery was seen only for shallow lesions in case of 20% xylitol+F compared to negative control. No lesion depth recovery, but significant mineral recovery was seen for F (2-days and 10-days lesion). CONCLUSIONS: All concentrations of xylitol+F reduced enamel surface demineralization, while only 20% xylitol+F improved surface remineralization of shallow lesions in vitro. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that while F or any concentration of xylitol + F reduces surface demineralization, only 20% xylitol+F improves surface remineralization of shallow lesions in vitro. Therefore, xylitol may be added into oral products, combined to F, to control dental caries.",

Our study aim was to compare the effects of three different low-cost and easy-to-use regimens with that of the gold standard (chlorhexidine [CHX] mouthwash) on the count of salivary S. mutans in dental students over 30 days. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-blinded parallel randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 120 dental students were included and randomly allocated into four intervention groups: (1) CHX mouthwash (control(, (2) probiotic yogurt, (3) casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate chewing gum, and (4) xylitol chewing gum. Salivary S. mutans counts were evaluated at baseline, 15 days, and 30 days after initiation of the study and compared at different times and among different groups using the repeated measures analysis of variance design analysis and least significant difference test with SPSS software version 20. The level of significance was determined to be 0.05. RESULTS: The microorganism count variable at baseline, first, and second follow-ups was significantly different for all groups except the probiotic yogurt group (P = 0.340). S. mutans count was significantly different when comparing the first follow-up and baseline values in the CHX and xylitol gum groups (P = 0.027, P = 0.037). When comparing the second follow-up with baseline values, a significant difference was observed in the xylitol gum group (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Xylitol chewing gum seems to be a viable alternative to the gold standard (CHX mouthwash) in reducing the salivary count of S. mutans."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of xylitol nasal spray as a prophylactic treatment for children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM). METHODS: This is a prospective pilot study of children aged 1-4 years, diagnosed with recurrent AOM (at least three episodes in the three months before recruitment) between December 1, 2019 and January 31, 2023. Children were treated with nasal xylitol spray 2-3 times daily for 3 months. The number of AOM episodes and treatments administered were compared within 3-month intervals: before recruitment, during xylitol use, and during the three subsequent months. RESULTS: Of 68 children enrolled, 66 (97%) completed the follow-up, until July 2023. Thirty-eight (58%) were males. Sixty-three children (95%) were 12-24-months old. The mean number of AOM episodes during xylitol use, 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-1.39), was lower than in the 3-month previous interval, 4.12 (95% CI: 3.89-4.40), p < 0.001; and similar to that in the subsequent 3-month interval, 0.79 (95% CI: 0.49-1.08), p = 0.082. A similar pattern was observed in an analysis of the number of AOM episodes per patient month. The data were similar during spring and summer months as during autumn and winter months. Across the consecutive three-month intervals, decreases were observed in the mean number of AOM episodes treated with systemic antibiotics (3.35, 0.65, and 0.41), p < 0.001; and with topical antibiotics (1.38, 0.55, and 0.32), p < 0.001. No major side effects were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the effectiveness and safety of nasal xylitol spray, for preventing recurrent AOM in children aged 1-4 years.",

The highest xylose concentration achieved was around 20 g/L via mild acid hydrolysis (5% nitric acid, 105 °C, 20-min residence time) with a solid loading of 10%. Two sets fermentability experiments were carried out of varying pH levels in synthetic media that includes acetic acid as the main inhibitors and hydrolysate supplemented with diverse nitrogen source. The results revealed that pH 7 exhibited the highest xylitol production, yielding 0.35 g/g. Furthermore, urea was found to be a highly promising and cost-effective substitute for yeast extract, as it yielded a comparable xylitol production of 0.31 g/g with marginal difference of only 0.01 g/g compared to yeast extract further highlights the viability of urea as the preferred option for reducing xylitol production cost. The absence of a significant difference between the synthetic media and hydrolysate, with only a marginal variance of 0.35 to 0.32 g/g, implies that acetic acid is indeed the primary constraint in xylitol production using PP hydrolysate. The study sheds light on PP biomass's potential for xylitol production, aligning economic benefits with environmental sustainability and waste management.",

The soluble and insoluble components of egg yolk and egg yolk containing xylitol treated at different temperatures were explored from the aspects of thermal instability behavior characterization and structure property. Magnetic resonance imaging and low field nuclear magnetic resonance showed that increased temperature induced liberation and transfer of hydrogen protons. Meanwhile, the apparent viscosity of soluble components increased, while that of insoluble components decreased. Microstructure showed that heat treatment induced aggregation and lipid transfer. SDS-PAGE showed that heat treatment induced aggregation and transformation of γ-livetin and apo-LDL. The change in crystal structure, Raman spectroscopy, and 3D fluorescence spectra showed that heat treatment resulted in the unfolding of yolk proteins, especially plasma proteins. Xylitol could alleviate transformation of components by stabilizing protein structure, alleviating the damage in protein integrity and elevation in aggregation size.",

These procedures usually imply the presence of congestion, secretions, and crusting related to the movement of the instruments during surgery. However, the use of nasal lavage may reduce this situation. The addition of Hyaluronic acid or Xylitol offers advantages in these washes. This study was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. All patients underwent endoscopic septoplasty with inferior turbinate submucosal resection without posterior nasal packing. SNOT-22, main VAS, NOSE, Modified Lund-Kennedy endoscopic scale, number of crusts and adhesions were quantified before and on the day of the surgery, visit three (seven days), visit four (fourteen days), and visit five (twenty-eight days). Forty-seven patients completed the study, divided into a standard saline arm (group 1, 22 patients) and normal saline plus HA and Xylitol arm (group 2, 27 patients). Both treatment groups improved their quality of life and objective parameters during the four weeks of the study. All patients tolerated the nasal irrigations well, and none discontinued the treatments.

Xylose-rich hydrolysate was prepared using 8% dilute sulfuric acid, at 120 °C for 90 min. Then, the acid-hydrolyzed solution was detoxified by individual overliming (OL), active carbon (AC), and their combination (OL+AC). The amounts of reducing sugars and inhibitors (furfural and hydroxyl methyl furfural) were measured after acid pre-treatment and detoxification process. Thereafter, xylitol was produced from detoxified hydrolysate by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa yeast. Results showed that after acid hydrolysis, the sugar yield was 20%. Detoxification by overliming and active carbon methods increased the reducing sugar content up to 65% and 36% and decreased the concentration of inhibitors to >90% and 16%, respectively. Also, combined detoxification caused an increase in the reducing sugar content (>73%) and a complete removal of inhibitors. The highest productivity of xylitol (0.366 g/g) by yeast was attained after the addition of 100 g/l non-detoxified xylose-rich hydrolysate into fermentation broth after 96 h, while the xylitol productivity enhanced to 0.496 g/g after adding the similar amount of xylose-rich hydrolysate detoxified by combined method (OL+AC2.5%).",

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the in vitro effect of a toothpaste formulation with reduced fluoride (F) concentration (200 ppm) supplemented with sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP: 0.2%), Xylitol (X:16%), and Erythritol (E: 4%) on dental enamel demineralization. METHODOLOGY: Bovine enamel blocks were selected according to initial surface hardness (SHi) and then divided into seven experimental toothpaste groups (n=12). These groups included 1) no F-TMP-X-E (Placebo); 2) 16% Xylitol and 4% Erythritol (X-E); 3) 16% Xylitol, 4% Erythritol and 0.2%TMP (X-E-TMP); 4) 200 ppm F (no X-E-TMP: (200F)); 5) 200 ppm F and 0.2% TMP (200F-TMP); 200 ppm F, 16% Xylitol, 4% Erythritol, and 0.2% TMP (200F-X-E-TMP); and 7) 1,100 ppm F (1100F). Blocks were individually treated 2×/day with slurries of toothpastes and subjected to a pH cycling regimen for five days (DES: 6 hours and RE: 18 hours). Then, the percentage of surface hardness loss (%SH), integrated loss of subsurface hardness (ΔKHN), fluoride (F), calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P) in enamel were determined. The data were analyzed by ANOVA (1-criterion) and the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p<0.001). RESULTS: We found that the 200F-X-E-TMP treatment reduced %SH by 43% compared to the 1100F treatments (p<0.001). The ΔKHN was ~ 65% higher with 200F-X-E-TMP compared to 1100F (p<0.001). The highest concentration of F in enamel was observed on the 1100F treatment (p<0.001). The 200F-X-E-TMP treatment promote higher increase of Ca and P concentration in the enamel (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The association of 200F-X-E-TMP led to a significant increase of the protective effect on enamel demineralization compared to the 1100F toothpaste.",

This study's primary endpoint was time to clinical recovery, defined as the change from baseline to end of treatment in COVID-19 symptoms. Outcome variables were the changes in visual analog scale (VAS) and daily symptoms score (DSS) on Days 1-7, 14, and 28 after the initiation of the 14-day treatment. There were no differences between the treatment groups in any demographic and subject characteristics-related variables, including vaccination status. None of the patients were hospitalized, or required emergency visits in addition to no adverse reactions were reported. There were no statistically significant interactions found for VAS (P=0.124), DSS (P=0.448), and sense of smell (P=0.667). The proportion of patients reporting nasal congestion was higher (X2=5.05; P=0.025) in the xylitol (XYL) group (73.1%) vs. the saline (SAL) group (41.7%) on Day 4, and on Day 7 (X2=5.72; P=0.017) XYL group (50.0%) vs. SAL group (17.4%). During Day 28 a total of two patients in the SAL group had anosmia vs. no patients with anosmia in the XYL group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (X2=5.72; P=0.133). Results demonstrate that both xylitol and saline were equally effective in decreasing the time of symptom resolution and preventing hospitalizations, yet, persistent anosmia was only seen in the SAL group. Intranasal xylitol might play a pivotal role in preventing persistent olfactory abnormalities in post-COVID-19 patients."

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Numerous studies have shown the beneficial role of fluoride in the primary prevention of dental caries. The aim of the present study was to put into evidence the change in the enamel structure immediately after the application of a fluoride varnish. (2) Methods: A xylitol−fluoride varnish was evaluated. The enamel specimens (n = 10) were analyzed by atomic force microscopy on enamel surface and treatment with fluoride varnish applied. The dimensional topographic analysis was performed by 2D and 3D analysis software. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 26.00 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). A one-sample statistics test was used to identify significant differences (p < 0.05). (3) Results: Surface roughness (Ra) measurements ranged from Ra = 0.039 μm (±0.048), to Ra = 0.049 μm (±0.031), respectively (p < 0.05), with an increase in the surface roughness passing from the intact enamel to the enamel exposed to fluoride varnish. When comparing Ra values of the nonfluorinated enamel and fluorinated enamel, significant differences (p < 0.05) were found, suggesting that the varnish had a protective effect on the enamel surface. (4) Conclusions: Xylitol−fluoride varnish, even in one single short-time application, is effective in reducing the surface roughness of enamel structure exposed to abrasion, thus increasing resistance to dental caries."

Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that whey protein isolate (WPI) and xylitol (XY) play an important role on T2D. This manuscript hypothesizes the supplementation of whey protein and xylitol complex (WXY) has the hypoglycemic and hyperlipidemia effect of T2D mice induced by the conjoint action of a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) by modulating of intestinal microbiota. The mice with diabetes displayed higher levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and other serum parameters than the normal mice. Treatment with WXY for 6 weeks significantly modulated the levels of FBG and insulin, improved insulin sensitivity, pancreas impairment and liver function in T2D mice, and the effect was better than that observed with WPI and XY groups. Moreover, supplementation with WXY significantly changed the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiota in T2D mice and restored the intestinal bacteria associated with T2D (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Lactobacillus). This may be a potential mechanism for alleviating T2D symptoms. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the relative abundances of specific genera (Turicibacter, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Lactobacillus, Candidatus_Saccharimonas, Faecalibaculum and Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002) were correlated with the levels of blood glucose and serum parameters. Therefore, WXY may be considered a promising dietary supplement for T2D treatment in the future.",

STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded study. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five children diagnosed with CRS were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomized to twice-daily hypertonic irrigations with saline or saline/xylitol for 6 weeks. The treatment outcomes were measured using: Sinonasal Quality of Life Survey (SN-5) completed at baseline and after 6 weeks of irrigation. RESULTS: There were statistically significant improvements in the hypertonic nasal saline group's (reduction in SN-5 domain scores) four domains and an increase in the overall QoL score within each group after 6 weeks of treatment compared to baseline; however, there were no differences in the activity limitation (p = 0.1803). The xylitol solution groups had no differences between the two groups in the SN-5 scores in any of the domains or the overall score at baseline, and post irrigation treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Due to low tolerance, compliance, and the side effects, xylitol irrigation is not recommended as a first-line treatment for pediatric CRS. The use of a large volume of low pressure, twice-daily intranasal hypertonic irrigation for 6 weeks is safe and effective in the treatment of pediatric CRS; therefore, it can be used as a baseline treatment for pediatric CRS before considering surgical interventions.",

In brief, the study comprised alkali treatment of Brassica juncea followed by its saccharification with cellulase consortia. An isolated strain was used for the co-production of xylitol and ethanol from sugar hydrolysate, and several parameters were systematically optimised for maximum co-production of ethanol and xylitol. Out of total glucose (149.72 g/L) and xylose (84.21 g/L) present in biomass hydrolysate, a product yield of 0.45 g/g (ethanol) and 0.62 g/g (xylitol) was achieved for a two-step fermentation process, which was 15.57% and 11.78% higher than the yield achieved for ethanol and xylitol, respectively, in a one-step fermentation process.",

      "abstract": "In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of xylitol on glycogen content, oxidative stress, purinergic and cholinergic dysfunction, and lipid dysmetabolism in hepatic tissue of diabetic rats. Seven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups as follows: normal control (NC), diabetic control (DC), diabetic xylitol 5% (DX5), diabetic xylitol 10% (DX10), and diabetic xylitol 20% (DX20). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) was induced in the diabetic groups, and after the confirmation of diabetes, the xylitol groups were supplied with their respective solutions. After 8 weeks intervention period, the animals were humanely sacrificed, and their hepatic tissues were harvested. Treatment with 10% xylitol compared with the other treatment groups had significantly (p < .05) higher liver glycogen level, reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and ENTPase activities, with concomitant reduction in malondialdehyde MDA level, ATPase and acetylcholinesterase activities. It further modulated lipid metabolism and restored hepatic morphology. The data suggest that xylitol at 10% had a better therapeutic effect against hepatic dysfunction associated with T2D. However, further clinical studies are still required to affirm these findings. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing progressively. Maintaining normal control of glucose metabolism and homeostatic glycemic levels is a key management strategy in delaying the onset of diabetic-related complications. The use of foods sweetened with sugar alcohols has brought an escalating interest, particularly among diabetic patients. Xylitol has been reported as a potential antidiabetic sweetener in various studies. Our findings in this study have shown that a 10% xylitol dietary dose can be used as a potential functional food additive for the alleviation of hepatic complications associated with T2D.",

Group 1 (intervention group) received probiotic yogurt (Activia, Danone) once per day, and group 2 (control group) received xylitol chewing gum (Trident original) three times per day. The primary outcome was salivary Streptococcus mutans count and secondary outcomes were interdental plaque Streptococcus mutans count, salivary pH and bacterial adherence. RESULTS: For Streptococcus mutans count in saliva and plaque, a statistically significant reduction in the level of MS over all the examined follow up periods of the study in probiotic yogurt group as well as xylitol gum group was found. An intergroup comparison for salivary MS count showed statistically significant difference between the two materials in a two week and a three month period of time and there was no statistically significant difference between both materials at one month time period. Salivary pH results showed statistically significant increase in pH in both groups along the follow-up periods. Bacterial adherence results showed statistically significant reduction in both groups.

In this study, we tested the antiviral action of three candidate nasal spray formulations against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. We determined that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 μg/mL inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The concentrations of iota-carrageenan with activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro may be easily achieved through the application of nasal sprays as commonly used in several countries. Recently a double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed that iota-carrageenan in isotonic sodium chloride reduces ca. five times the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in health care personnel. Further, xylitol at a concentration of 50 mg/mL (ca. 329 mM) was found to exert some antiviral action, though this preliminary finding needs further confirmation.",

Antibacterial agents such as fluoride are used in both prevention and treatment, but their application in children faces limitations such as fluorosis. Therefore, novel methods of caries prevention among the children are mainly focused on the use of fluoride-free active ingredients. In this comparative study, antibacterial effects of gels containing propolis and aloe vera, fluoride, xylitol, and CPP-ACP were investigated. METHODS: This is an in vitro study. By plate well technique, plates containing gels were created in the culture medium of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus, and their antibacterial impacts were evaluated by measuring the inhibition zone after 24, 48, and 72 hours. Then, different concentrations of each gel were evaluated in the same way for the antibacterial properties. For each sample, this process was iterated 3 times, where the average was declared as the final number. The collected data were entered in SPSS 24. RESULTS: In both bacteria, propolis gel and aloe vera had the highest zone of inhibition, followed by fluoride and xylitol in the second and third places, respectively. Different concentrations of gels are significantly different in terms of antimicrobial effect (P value ≤ 0/05). The antimicrobial effect of propolis and aloe vera gel was kept up to the concentration of 1/16. As the bacterial and gel contact time is prolonged, the antibacterial effect of different gels increases, but the difference is not statistically significant (P value = 0.109). CPP-ACP gel had no antimicrobial effect at any concentration. CONCLUSION: Propolis and aloe vera gel had a greater antimicrobial effect than other gels, where such effect was observed in low concentrations. CPP-ACP gel had no antimicrobial properties."

In vitro and in vivo assays were performed to challenge and to prove the efficacy of propanediol, xylitol and caprylic acid (PXCA) against acne. PXCA had its MIC challenged against C. acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) and Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in concentrations of 0.125% and 0.25%, respectively, and it also developed antimicrobial activity against C. acnes (time-kill test). PXCA was able to reduce the 5-alpha reductase expression in 24% (p < 0.01) in comparison with the testosterone group. By the end of 28 days of treatment, the compound reduced the skin oiliness, porphyrin amount and the quantity of inflammatory lesions in participants. According to the dermatologist evaluation, PXCA improved the skin's general appearance, acne presence and size.",

Gum is a familiar confectionery, and several drug-loaded gums are on the market as medicated chewing gums. In this study, medical gum tablets composed of confectionery xylitol gum and a drug (ibuprofen or acetaminophen) were prepared and evaluated for the purpose of potential hospital applications. The effect of the sintering process, a heating treatment, on the physical properties of the solid materials was also examined. The sintering process markedly improved the hardness of the gum tablets. The sintering temperature and time affected the hardness of both ibuprofen- and acetaminophen-loaded gum tablets, whereas heat treatment around the melting point of ibuprofen or xylitol and longer heat treatment resulted in failure of the preparation or a reduction in hardness. The sintered gum tablets exhibited a delayed drug release profile in artificial saliva after an in vitro chewing test. The current results provide basic and useful information about the preparation of gum-containing tablets in future clinical settings.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antidemineralizing effect of two concentrations of xylitol varnish. TRIAL DESIGN: Triple-blind, four-arm, parallel-group, single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial. METHODS: A total of 120 orthodontic patients were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 30), using a computer-generated randomized block list. The treatment groups were: 10% xylitol, 20% xylitol, 5% fluoride, and placebo. Tooth demineralization was measured with DIAGNOdent at T1 (before treatment), followed by varnish application. At T2 (third month), the varnish was re-applied, and at the third (T2) and sixth (T3) months, and after treatment (T4), the demineralization was measured. The white spot lesion frequency was assessed visually after treatment. The participants, the clinician, and data assessors were all blinded to group assignments. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients underwent per-protocol analyses. At T2, the mean DIAGNOdent numbers in the fluoride and 10% xylitol groups were significantly lower than the placebo group (P = 0.00), with a mean difference of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.15-1.10) and 0.5 (95% CI, 0.04-0.95), respectively. At T3, the fluoride and 10% xylitol groups had significantly lower mineral loss than the placebo group (P=0.046) with a mean difference of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.14-0.89) in the fluoride and 0.45 (95% CI, 0.03-0.86) in the 10% xylitol groups, respectively. However, at T4, only the mean for the 10% xylitol group was significantly different (P=0.049) from the placebo group, with a mean difference of 1.18 (95% CI, 0.42-1.93). Visual assessment showed that after treatment, the prevalence of white spot lesions in the fluoride (P=0.03) and 10% xylitol (P=0.00) groups was less than the placebo group with the odds ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.46-0.96) and 0.43 (95% CI, 0.28-0.64), respectively. CONCLUSION: The 10% xylitol varnish short-term effects on caries control were significantly greater than 20% xylitol varnish and placebo but similar to fluoride varnish. However, the 10% xylitol long-term effect was almost better than fluoride varnish. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol was registered at IRCT.ir under the code IRCT20180913041032N1.",

      "abstract": "Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen and causes wound and burn infections. It shows high resistance to antibiotics and its pathogenicity is mediated by an arsenal of virulence factors. Another therapeutic option to such infections is targeting quorum sensing (QS), which controls the expression of different S. marcescens virulence factors. Prevention of QS can deprive S. marcescens from its bacterial virulence without applying stress on the bacterial growth and facilitates the eradication of the bacteria by immunity. The objective of the current study is to explore the antimicrobial and antivirulence activities of xylitol against S. marcescens. Xylitol could inhibit the growth of S. marcescens. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of xylitol could inhibit biofilm formation, reduce prodigiosin production, and completely block protease activity. Moreover, xylitol decreased swimming motility, swarming motility and increased the sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. The expression of rsmA, pigP, flhC, flhD fimA, fimC, shlA bsmB, and rssB genes that regulate virulence factor production was significantly downregulated by xylitol. In silico study showed that xylitol could bind with the SmaR receptor by hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding, and interfere with the binding of the natural ligand with SmaR receptor. An in vivo mice survival test confirmed the ability of xylitol to protect mice against the virulence of S. marcescens. In conclusion, xylitol is a growth and virulence inhibitor in S. marcescens and can be employed for the treatment of S. marcescens wound and burn infections."

AIMS: We aimed at estimating the effect of using toothpaste with hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronan, HA) and xylitol (HAX) as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of plaque-induced gingivitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty male patients who were in the age group of 20 to 35 years participated in this study. All of them endured 4 appointments, who suffered plaque-induced gingivitis, they distributed into 2 groups depending on the toothpaste variety: group 1 (G1): made up of 30 patients who consume toothpaste that contains HAX, while group 2 (G2): made up of 30 patients who consume toothpaste without HAX (placebo type). Clinical periodontal parameters (CPPs) for all of them were recorded, once at the beginning of the treatment besides four times throughout the treatment at weekly interims during all visits. RESULTS: The means of plaque indices (PLI) and gingival indices (GI) decreased along with the sessions for both groups, where the initial means of PLI and GI (baseline) were 2.55 ± 0.14, 2.33 ± 0.15 for the G1, and 2.57 ± 0.13, 2.34 ± 0.16 for G2, respectively; whereas the least means shown at the fourth visit were 0.39 ± 0.05, 0.30 ± 0.06 for G1, and 0.71 ± 0.07, 0.61 ± 0.05 for G2, respectively. There was a reduction in the mean percent of bleeding on probing (BOP) score 1 for all visits in both groups. Finally, an intragroup comparison among dissimilar visits and intergroup comparisons for each visit showed highly significant differences at a P-value of ≤ 0.001 for PLI, GI, and BOP. CONCLUSIONS: Using toothpaste with or without HAX can decrease gingival inflammation; it can result in a higher improvement in the periodontal status of patients than toothpaste without HAX."

The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of fluoride and xylitol varnishes in preventing NCLs during comprehensive orthodontic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample comprised 55 volunteers from 15 to 20 years of age under orthodontic treatment that were randomly divided into three groups: Fluoride Group (FG; n=17), Xylitol Group (XG; n=19), and Placebo Group (PG; n=19). The patients in each group received two applications of the following varnishes: DuraphatTM (5% NaF), 20% xylitol, and placebo (no F/Xylitol) in the three groups, respectively. The varnishes were applied in the first appointment (T0) and 3 months later (T1). Clinical examinations were carried out at T0 and 6 months after (T2) using the ICDAS index and the QLF system (fluorescence difference). The intergroup comparisons were performed by ANOVA/Tukey's or Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn's tests (P<0.05). RESULTS: There was no significant intergroup difference regarding ICDAS index changes from T0 to T2. Fluoride varnish produced significantly greater increase in fluorescence of NCLs (mean change of -0.65 +0.78 and -0.56 +0.83, for maxilla and mandible, respectively) in comparison to the other groups. The majority of non-cavitated lesions improved in the fluoride and xylitol varnish groups. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoride varnish produced significantly greater increase in enamel fluorescence compared to xylitol and placebo varnishes. In short term, both fluoride and xylitol varnishes produced remineralization of NCLs in orthodontic patients. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Non-cavitated lesions can be effectively controlled in high-risk orthodontic patients by means of fluoride varnishes.

      "abstract": "The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR), including symptoms of sneezing, nasal itching, airflow obstruction, and nasal discharge caused by histamine and immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions, is ~30% in the U.S. Recent studies seem to suggest that the allergic inflammatory processes in AR may be induced by the interaction between an allergen (trigger) and the nasal microbiome (substrate). In this study, we have identified two agents with antihistaminic and microbiome-modulating characteristics that can be administered intranasally, namely, chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM) and xylitol (X). This study aimed to test the efficacy of intranasal CPM plus xylitol (CPM+X) nasal for the treatment of AR in an outpatient setting. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 30-day pilot study was conducted during the spring of 2019. After starting five days of placebo therapy (run-in period), patients with moderate-to-severe AR nasal symptoms were randomized to treatment with CPM+X (n=16) spray and nasal saline placebo (PLB; n=13). Both treatments were administered in the form of one spray dose (~100 µL of the solution containing 1.25 mg CPM) per nostril twice a day. Outcome variables were the changes in visual analog scale (VAS) and daily symptoms score (DSS) at days 1, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 30 after the initiation of the treatment. ANOVA (analysis of variance) with repeated revealed a significant treatment-by-time interaction such that the CPM+X group had a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in both DSS (∆-3.0 ± 2.7) and VAS (∆-3.8 ± 2.0) scores compared to PLB after 30 days. The difference in DSS and VAS scores between the groups was evident just after five days (day 10) of using CPM+X. The CPM+X scores were significantly lower (p < 0.008) starting from day 10 compared with day 1, whereas there were no statistically significant (p > 0.008) changes in the PLB during the 30-day treatment window. The present data suggest that nasal CPM+X use effectively improves AR symptoms. A large-scale study of the long-term effects of CPM+X for the treatment of other chronic respiratory disorders and the potential microbiome-modulating effects warrants further investigation."

Preservation of PM integrity and transport function is the key to the success of PD therapy, particularly in the long term, since the prolonged exposure to unphysiological hypertonic glucose-based PD solutions in current use is detrimental to the PM, with progressive loss of peritoneal ultrafiltration capacity causing technique failure. Moreover, absorbing too much glucose intraperitoneally from the dialysate may give rise to a number of systemic metabolic effects. Here we report the preliminary results of the first clinical experience based on the use in continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients of novel PD solutions obtained through partly replacing the glucose load with other osmotically active metabolites, such as L-carnitine and xylitol. Ten CAPD patients were treated for four weeks with the new solutions. There was good tolerance to the experimental PD solutions, and no adverse safety signals were observed. Parameters of dialysis efficiency including creatinine clearance and urea Kt/V proved to be stable as well as fluid status, diuresis, and total peritoneal ultrafiltration. The promising tolerance and local/systemic advantages of using L-carnitine and xylitol in the PD solution merit further research.",

The objective of this study was to examine microbiome changes in post-surgical CRS patients when rinsing with commercially available products containing xylitol or Lactococcus lactis. METHODS: A crossover-type protocol with a washout period was designed. Swab samples from anterior ethmoid cavities of CRS patients were collected prospectively at baseline. Subjects were provided packets containing either L. lactis W136 or xylitol in non-blinded fashion and instructed to add it to their rinse bottles daily for 28 days, after which another swab was taken. A saline wash-out period was completed and a third swab taken. A final 28-day regimen of the opposite product was followed by a final swab. DNA extraction and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene allowed for global microbiome analysis. RESULTS: We enrolled 25 subjects with CRS and 10 controls resulting in 70 adequate samples. Increased detection of Lactococcus was observed after use of L. lactis. No significant trends in alpha or beta diversity as a result of treatment were observed. SNOT-22 score did not change significantly following treatment with xylitol, L. lactis, or saline. CONCLUSION: We did not detect any major clinical or microbiome-level effect due to treatment with two topical rinse products.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were searched. 4457 records were screened and 26 trials were included. Data from 16 trials was pooled using Review Manager 5.4. Level of significance was p < .05. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. RESULTS: Pooled analysis of two trials for white spot lesions (WSLs) regression (SMD -0.6, 95% CI: [-1.07 to -0.14], p = .01) and three trials for post-intervention DIAGNOdent values (SMD -1.24, 95% CI: [-1.96 to -0.52], p = .0007) significantly favoured CPP-ACP-TF combined therapy over TF mono-therapy. The sub-group analysis for caries increment (SMD -0.14, 95% CI: [-0.21 to -0.07], p < .0001) and the post intervention S mutans count (SMD -0.42, 95% CI: [-0.62 to -0.23], p < .0001) significantly favours 'xylitol-TF' and 'CPP-ACP-TF' combined therapy respectively. The high/unclear risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness of the included trials presented a low certainty of evidence. CONCLUSION: CPP-ACP-TF exhibits superiority over TF monotherapy in remineralizing existing lesions and demonstrates better antibacterial effect, whereas it is not more effective for preventing caries incidence. However, Xylitol exerts an added benefit over fluoride alone in preventing caries increment. The low-certainty evidence highlights the need for more good quality trials.",

      "abstract": "Xylitol was biotechnologically produced by Kluyveromyces marxianus ATCC36907 using the hemicellulosic hydrolysate of the cashew apple bagasse (CABHH). Sequentially, the present study investigated the recovery and purification of xylitol evaluating different antisolvents [ethanol, isopropanol and the ionic liquid 2-hydroxyl-ethylammonium acetate (2-HEAA)], their proportion in the medium (10-90% v/v), and their cooling rate (VC 0.25-0.50 °C/min). These processes were contrasted with the crystallization process of commercial xylitol. This study is the first to assess xylitol crystallization using a protic ionic liquid. The hydrolysate obtained from a mild treatment with sulfuric acid contained mainly glucose and xylose at concentrations of 15.7 g/L and 11.9 g/L, respectively. With this bioprocess, a maximum xylitol production of 4.5 g/L was achieved. The performance of the investigated antisolvents was similar in all conditions evaluated in the crystallization process of the commercial xylitol, with no significant difference in yields. For the crystallization processes of the produced xylitol, the best conditions were: 50% (v/v) isopropanol as antisolvent, cooling rate of 0.5 °C/min, with a secondary nucleation of yield and purity of 69.7% and 84.8%, respectively. Under the same linear cooling rate, using ethanol, isopropanol or the protic ionic liquid 2-hydroxyl-ethylammonium acetate (2-HEAA), crystallization did not occur, probably due to the presence of carbohydrates not metabolized by the yeast in the broth, which influences the solubility curve of xylitol. With the results of this work, a possible economical and environmentally friendly process of recovery and purification of xylitol from CABHH could be proposed.",

      "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus has created an unprecedented impact on healthcare globally. Being a novel virus, several treatments have been explored against COVID-19. During the early stages of the disease, treatment is mainly supportive. While several studies have suggested different treatment modalities, there is still no definitive treatment against COVID-19. Re-purposing already established medications, with excellent safety profiles, is a possible approach for treating the disease in its early stage. Having a mode of transmission as a droplet mode, several studies have supported how the nose can contain the primary route of entry of SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we postulated that re-purposing a commercially available nasal spray containing xylitol and grapefruit seed extract (GSE), namely Xlear Nasal Spray® (Xlear, Inc., American Fork, USA) could be used as an adjunct treatment of COVID-19. With a well-established safety profile, the components of this nasal spray have been studied and have been shown to have potential efficacy against viral pathogens, including coronavirus, and may potentially regulate pathways important in the initial entry of infection, replication, and systemic response to SARS-CoV-2. We present a series of three mild-moderate risks, symptomatic, COVID-19 patients, treated with the intranasal combination, as an adjuvant to their ongoing treatment, with rapid clinical improvement and shorten time to negativization on repeat intranasal swab test via PCR. No safety issues were noted during the course of treatment. Xlear nasal spray, containing xylitol plus GSE, given its established safety profile and compelling clinical results described here, could be a potential adjunct treatment option in mild-moderate COVID-19 cases."

Xylitol prevents demineralization of teeth and bones, otitis media infection, respiratory tract infections, inflammation and cancer progression. NADPH generated in xylitol metabolism aid in the treatment of glucose-6-phosphate deficiency-associated hemolytic anemia. Moreover, it has a negligible effect on blood glucose and plasma insulin levels due to its unique metabolism. Its diverse applications in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food and polymer industries fueled its market growth and made it one of the top 12 bio-products. Recently, xylitol has also been used as a drug carrier due to its high permeability and non-toxic nature. However, it become a challenge to fulfil the rapidly increasing market demand of xylitol. Xylitol is present in fruit and vegetables, but at very low concentrations, which is not adequate to satisfy the consumer demand. With the passage of time, other methods including chemical catalysis, microbial and enzymatic biotransformation, have also been developed for its large-scale production. Nevertheless, large scale production still suffers from high cost of production. In this review, we summarize some alternative approaches and recent advancements that significantly improve the yield and lower the cost of production."

Our aims is evaluate the improvement of oral extra-oesophageal manifestations in patients with GORD using xylitol-malic acid tablets to stimulate salivary secretion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The effectiveness of salivary stimulation using xylitol-malic acid tablets (as a supplement to omeprazole 40 mg/day) was assessed in a clinical trial (n = 14) lasting six months with patients with prior positive pH-metry, through GORD extra-oesophageal clinical signs, GerdQ and RDQ questionnaires, odontological variables, basal salivary secretion, stimulated salivary secretion, pH and buffer capacity, mucosal erythema index and dental wear. STATISTICS: chi-square (Haberman post-hoc), ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U; variables between visits were evaluated with McNemar's Student's t and Wilcoxon tests; p < 0.05. RESULTS: 100% of patients not taking xylitol-malic acid presented xerostomia, but only 14.3% of patients taking xylitol-malic acid (p < 0.01) did. The mean saliva-buffer capacity at the last visit for patients not taking xylitol-malic acid was 2.14 ± 0.38, versus 2.71 ± 0.49 for patients taking xylitol-malic acid (p < 0.05). Retro-sternal burning (p < 0.05), heartburn (p < 0.05) and regurgitation (p < 0.05) were also reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Xylitol-malic acid tablets improve quality of life among patients with GORD, by reducing dry mouth, increasing saliva buffering and reducing heartburn, retro-sternal burning and regurgitation.",

Xylitol can be employed with nasal irrigation and can provide better control of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the effects of nasal lavage with saline solution compared to nasal lavage with a xylitol solution. METHODS: Fifty-two patients, divided into two groups (n = 26 in the \"Xylitol\" group and n = 26 in the \"Saline solution\" group) answered questionnaires validated in Portuguese (NOSE and SNOT-22) about their nasal symptoms and general symptoms, before and after endonasal endoscopic surgery and after a period of 30 days of nasal irrigation. RESULTS: The \"Xylitol\" group showed significant improvement in pain relief and nasal symptom reduction after surgery and nasal irrigation with xylitol solution (p < 0.001). The \"Saline solution\" group also showed symptom improvement, but on a smaller scale. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the xylitol solution can be useful in the postoperative period after endonasal endoscopic surgery, because it leads to a greater reduction in nasal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Xylitol is an approved food additive that is widely used as a sweetener in many manufactured products. It is also used in pharmaceuticals. Secondary oxalosis resulting from high dietary oxalate has been reported. However, reported cases of oxalosis following xylitol infusion are rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old man with a 16-year history of organic psychiatric disorder was hospitalized for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of cholecystolithiasis. He had been treated with several antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, including lithium. The patient had polyuria (> 4000 mL/day) and his serum sodium levels ranged from 150 to 160 mmol/L. Urine osmolality was 141 mOsm/L, while serum arginine vasopressin level was 6.4 pg/mL. The patient was diagnosed with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), and lithium was gradually discontinued. Postoperative urine volumes increased further to a maximum of 10,000 mL/day, and up to 10,000 mL/day of 5% xylitol was administered. The patient's consciousness level declined and serum creatinine increased to 4.74 mg/dL. This was followed by coma and metabolic acidosis. After continuous venous hemodiafiltration, serum sodium improved to the upper 140 mmol/L range and serum creatinine decreased to 1.25 mg/dL at discharge. However, polyuria and polydipsia of approximately 4000 mL/day persisted. Renal biopsy showed oxalate crystals and decreased expression of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the renal tubules. Urinary AQP2 was undetected. The patient was discharged on day 82 after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient was diagnosed with lithium-induced NDI and secondary oxalosis induced by excess xylitol infusion. NDI became apparent perioperatively because of fasting, and an overdose of xylitol infusion led to cerebrorenal oxalosis. Our patient received a maximum xylitol dose of 500 g/day and a total dose of 2925 g. Patients receiving lithium therapy must be closely monitored during the perioperative period, and rehydration therapy using xylitol infusion should be avoided in such cases.",

There is not much of treatment choice rather than nasal steroids. In this pathological study, we have been aimed to represent the healing effects of xylitol on damaged nasal mucosa due to rhinitis medicamentosa. METHOD: 30 Wistar rats were separated into 5 groups. During 2 months, oxymetazoline was given to the first group, and saline was given to second group intranasally. First and second group animals were examined at the end of 2 months and rhinitis medicamentosa was detected. Oxymetazoline was given to the third, fourth, and fifth groups during 2 months. Then xylitol solution, mometasone, and saline were applied, respectively, for 15 days. After the experiment, rats' nasal mucosas were evaluated histopathologically. RESULTS: Xylitol and mometasone were found to be more effective than the control group in terms of histopathological changes. Effectivity of xylitol and mometasone was compared and not a significant value was determined. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, xylitol solution is effective as mometasone, usable and well-priced in the treatment of rhinitis medicamentosa. More comprehensive and ultrastructural studies on animals and human studies with rhinometric evaluation should be performed.",

The isolated yeast was identified molecularly, taxonomically, and morphologically as Candida tropicalis YHJ1, and analyzed for application in xylitol production. The isolated yeast showed stress tolerance toward various chemical reagents and could grow with up to 600 g/L xylose in the culture medium. This yeast also had a broad carbohydrate utilization spectrum, and its xylitol yield was greatest in medium supplemented with xylose as the sole carbon source. In batch fermentation for xylitol production, the yeast could convert xylose prepared from acidic EPFBF pretreatment wastewater into xylitol. Interestingly, C. tropicalis YHJ1 xylose reductase, containing a Ser279 residue, exhibited more effective xylitol conversion compared to orthologous Candida enzymes containing Leu279 or Asn279; this improvement was associated with NADPH binding, as predicted through homologous structure modeling and enzyme kinetic analysis. Taken together, these results show a novel stress-tolerant yeast strain that may be applicable to xylitol production from toxic lignocellulosic byproducts."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the growth and acid synthesis of cariogenic pathogens in vitro when rebaudioside A was the sole source of carbon, compared to sucrose, xylitol, and a commercial sweetener containing rebaudioside A. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, sucrose or sugar substitutes were added to human saliva and the pH was measured over 10 h. Subsequently, the growth and acid synthesis efficiency of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus oralis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Candida albicans were investigated: after adding them to minimal culture media containing only one of the carbon sources, the optical density and pH were determined over 10 h. RESULTS: A significant pH drop only occurred in the sucrose group of human saliva whereas no differences were found between the sugar substitute groups. The individual strains of caries pathogens showed significantly lower growth rates and less acid synthesis in the sugar replacement groups, in comparison to sucrose. However, these groups also showed bacterial growth and a decline in pH. CONCLUSION: Xylitol appeared to be superior to rebaudioside A regarding the inhibition of mutans streptococci. The results for the remaining microorganisms indicate that rebaudioside A causes a similar or lower acid synthesis than xylitol. As saliva contains buffer systems, the metabolism of rebaudioside A did not seem to shift the equilibrium to demineralization. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Rebaudioside A may not be suitable as a targeted Streptococcus mutans treatment, but it could contribute to a reduction of caries risk as a replacement for sucrose.",

      "abstract": "We previously showed that topical application of hexoses such as fructose accelerates barrier recovery after disruption. We also showed that various hexoses and polyols interact with phospholipid and alter the phase transition temperature. Thus, we hypothesized that the improvement of barrier recovery by hexoses and polyols might be related to the interaction with phospholipid. Here, we tested this idea by examining the effects of xylitol (a component of some skin-care products) and fructose on lipid dynamics in an epidermal-equivalent model at the single-cell level by means of two-photon microscopy after staining with Laurdan, a fluorescent dye sensitive to the physical properties of its membrane environment. First, we confirmed that topical application of xylitol aqueous solution on tape-stripped human skin accelerated barrier recovery. Then, we examined changes of lipid fluidity in the epidermal-equivalent model after application of water or an aqueous solution of xylitol or fructose. Application of xylitol and/or fructose increased the lipid fluidity in the uppermost part of the stratum granulosum layer, compared to treatment with water alone, and accelerated the exocytosis of lamellar bodies to the intercellular domain between stratum corneum and stratum granulosum. Our results support the idea that the improvement of epidermal barrier homeostasis upon topical application of xylitol or fructose is due to increased lipid fluidity in the uppermost layer of the stratum granulosum, which enables accelerated release of lipid from the stratum granulosum, thereby improving the lamellar structure and accelerating epidermal permeability barrier recovery.",

Very little is known about other species which are possibly beneficial to oral health. In this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to profile microbial communities of saliva and plaque following short-term consumption of xylitol and sorbitol containing chewing gum. Participants (n = 30) underwent a washout period and were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Each group chewed either xylitol or sorbitol gum for three weeks, before undergoing a second four-week washout period after which they switched to the alternate gum for three weeks. Analysis of samples collected before and after each intervention identified distinct plaque and saliva microbial communities that altered dependent on the order in which gum treatments were given. Neither the xylitol nor sorbitol treatments significantly affected the bacterial composition of plaque. Lactobacilli were undetected and the number of Streptococcus mutans sequence reads was very low and unaffected by either xylitol or sorbitol. However, sorbitol affected several other streptococcal species in saliva including increasing the abundance of S. cristatus, an oral commensal shown to inhibit bacteria associated with chronic periodontitis."

Because of these structural advantages, the biocompatibilities of the CF-MP as a cell carrier were improved according to the immobilization behavior of microorganisms and batch fermentation. The optimized immobilization efficiency of Candida tropicalis on the CF-MP was improved to 0.587 g g-1, and the maximum xylitol yield and volumetric productivity were 67.15% and 1.16 g h-1 L-1, respectively, which were substantially higher than that in case of the untreated CF. This indicated that the biocompatibility of CF improved after the favorable MP surface treatment, resulting in the enhancement of immobilized efficiency and xylitol fermentation.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of twenty individuals in the age group of 18-25 years were randomly divided into two Groups A and B. Test arm A received xylitol gums and test arm B received CPP-ACP gums and they were instructed to use the gums thrice daily for 2 weeks. Unstimulated salivary samples were collected before they began the use of the gums for baseline values, 24 h after beginning the usage of chewing gums and at the end of 14 days. The samples were analyzed for pH, buffer capacity, and S. mutans levels. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction of salivary S. mutans levels, improvement in salivary pH, and buffer capacity were displayed in both groups 24 h and 14 days after the intervention when compared with baseline. Group B showed more statistically significant improvement in pH than group A after 24 h (P = 0.028) and at the end of 2 weeks (P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: CPP-ACP has better ability than xylitol in improving the pH of saliva. Both CPP-ACP and xylitol gums individually have remarkable ability in bringing down S. mutans levels while simultaneously improving the pH and buffer of saliva.",

In this preventative randomised trial, xylitol will be tested for the prevention of acute otitis media (AOM), a common and costly condition in young children. The primary outcome will be the incidence of AOM. Secondary outcomes will include upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and dental caries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a pragmatic, blinded (participant and parents, practitioners and analyst), two-armed superiority, placebo-controlled randomised trial with 1:1 allocation, stratified by clinical site. The trial will be conducted in the 11 primary care group practices participating in the TARGet Kids! research network in Canada. Eligible participants between the ages of 2-4 years will be randomly assigned to the intervention arm of regular xylitol syrup use or the control arm of regular sorbitol use for 6 months. We expect to recruit 236 participants, per treatment arm, to detect a 20% relative risk reduction in AOM episodes. AOM will be identified through chart review. The secondary outcomes of URTIs and dental caries will be identified through monthly phone calls with specified questions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval from the Research Ethics Boards at the Hospital for Sick Children and St. Michael's Hospital has been obtained for this study and also for the TARGet Kids! research network. Results will be submitted for publication to a peer-reviewed journal and will be discussed with decision makers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03055091; Pre-results.",

However, we lack information about their exact cellular mechanisms and their effects on the gene expression profiles. Therefore, in this study, we aimed at investigating the effects of glycerol and xylitol on human epidermal keratinocytes. The polyols (identical osmolarities; xylitol: 0.0045%-0.45%; glycerol: 0.0027%-0.27%) did not alter cellular viability or intracellular calcium concentration. However, they exerted differential effects on the expression of certain genes and signalling pathways. Indeed, both polyols up-regulated the expression of filaggrin, loricrin, involucrin and occludin; yet, xylitol exerted somewhat more profound effects. Moreover, while both polyols stimulated the MAPK pathway, only xylitol induced the activation-dependent translocation of protein kinase Cδ, a key promoter of epidermal differentiation. Finally, in various keratinocyte inflammation models, both polyols (albeit with different efficacies) exerted anti-inflammatory effects. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that glycerol and xylitol differentially modulate expressions of multiple genes and activities of signalling pathways in epidermal keratinocytes. Thus, our findings invite clinical trials to explore the applicability and the impact of a combined glycerol-xylitol therapy in the management of various skin conditions.",

Free radical scavenging and ferric reducing potentials of different concentrations of xylitol were investigated in vitro. For in vivo study, six weeks old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups, namely: Normal Control (NC), Diabetic Control (DBC), Normal Xylitol (NXYL) and Diabetic Xylitol (DXYL). T2D was induced in the DBC and DXYL groups. After the confirmation of diabetes, a 10% xylitol solution was supplied instead of drinking water to NXYL and DXYL, while normal drinking water was supplied to NC and DBC ad libitum. After five weeks intervention period, the animals were sacri- ficed and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations as well as superoxide dismutase, catalase glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activities were determined in the liver, heart, kidney, pancreatic tissues and serum samples. Xylitol exhibited significant (p < 0.05) in vitro nitric oxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging and ferric reducing activities. In vivo study revealed significant (p < 0.05) reduction in TBARS concentrations in the xylitol consuming groups compared to their respective controls. Significant (p < 0.05) increase in GSH levels and antioxidant enzyme activities were observed in analyzed tissues and serum of xylitol-fed animals compared to their respective controls. Results of this study indicate that xylitol has strong anti-oxidative potential against T2D-associated oxidative stress. Hence, xylitol can be used as a potential supplement in diabetic foods and food products.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to study the efficacy of chewing gum in patients with rectal cancer after elective open proctectomy only. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial was performed. We recruited patients who would undergo elective open proctectomy for rectal cancer in Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital. Patients in the intervention arm received chewing gum 3 times a day postoperatively. All patients in the trial were placed on the same perioperative management and standardized post-operative care plans. The primary outcome was time to the first peristalsis sounds, time to first flatus and the first defecation. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were recruited. The time to the first flatus was 42.33 ± 3.46 h in the gum group and 49.20 ± 1.42 h in the control group (p < 0.05). The time to the first defecation was significantly shorter in the gum-chewing group than in the control group (66.07 ± 2.36 vs. 78.37 ± 1.62 h; p < 0.05). Post-operative ileus (POI) was confirmed in 2 patients in the gum-chewing group and in 7 in the control group (7.0% vs. 23.9%; p = 0.028). DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that chewing gum is a method to reduce the time to first flatus, time to first defecation and POI in patients undergoing elective open proctectomy for rectal cancer.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A parallel design, randomised controlled trial was conducted among 75 dental students. Participants were randomised into CHX, CHX+XYL and XYL-only groups using the lottery method. Subjects were instructed to use 10 ml of the provided mouthwash for 15 s twice daily for 3 weeks. All the outcome measures, gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI) and number of salivary S. mutans CFU were recorded at baseline and 3 weeks post intervention. Nonparametric tests were used for inferential statistics. RESULTS: All outcome variables (GI, PI scores and log10 salivary S. mutans counts) decreased significantly from baseline compared to post intervention among all three groups. Intergroup comparison demonstrated that reduction in GI was not significantly different among the three groups. The decrease in PI scores was found to be significantly higher in the XYL group, while the decrease in the log10 salivary S. mutans count was significantly higher in the CHX+XYL group. CONCLUSION: The present study provided sufficient data to suggest that all the three mouthwashes are effective against plaque, gingivitis and S. mutans load in saliva. Further investigations should be carried out to confirm the results and develop strategies for using such products to prevent tooth decay.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study compared xylitol gum plus oral health education (intervention group, n = 93) with oral health education alone (control group, n = 81) among students aged 7-18 years in special needs schools in Khon Kaen, Thailand. The primary outcome was caries onset rate measured as the change in caries onset on tooth surfaces. The secondary outcome was plaque index. Between-group differences were determined using generalised estimated equations and a general linear model under the intention-to-treat approach. RESULTS: After 1 year, there was a significantly lower caries rate in the primary dentition among the intervention group compared to the control group (0.08 vs 0.12 surfaces per surface-year, respectively; adjusted relative risk = 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.96; p = 0.03), but there was no significant difference in the caries rates for the permanent dentition. Remineralisation also occurred more in the intervention vs the control group in the primary dentition only. Oral hygiene was significantly improved in the intervention but not in the control group (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This programme reduced the caries rate and enhanced remineralisation in primary dentition, and improved oral hygiene in students with disabilities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reducing the use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections is needed to limit the global threat of antibiotic resistance. We estimated the effectiveness of probiotics and xylitol for the management of pharyngitis. METHODS: In this parallel-group factorial randomized controlled trial, participants in primary care (aged 3 years or older) with pharyngitis underwent randomization by nurses who provided sequential intervention packs. Pack contents for 3 kinds of material and advice were previously determined by computer-generated random numbers: no chewing gum, xylitol-based chewing gum (15% xylitol; 5 pieces daily) and sorbitol gum (5 pieces daily). Half of each group were also randomly assigned to receive either probiotic capsules (containing 24 × 109 colony-forming units of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) or placebo. The primary outcome was mean self-reported severity of sore throat and difficulty swallowing (scale 0-6) in the first 3 days. We used multiple imputation to avoid the assumption that data were missing completely at random. RESULTS: A total of 1009 individuals consented, 934 completed the baseline assessment, and 689 provided complete data for the primary outcome. Probiotics were not effective in reducing the severity of symptoms: mean severity scores 2.75 with no probiotic and 2.78 with probiotic (adjusted difference -0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.24 to 0.24). Chewing gum was also ineffective: mean severity scores 2.73 without gum, 2.72 with sorbitol gum (adjusted difference 0.07, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.37) and 2.73 with xylitol gum (adjusted difference 0.01, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.30). None of the secondary outcomes differed significantly between groups, and no harms were reported. INTERPRETATION: Neither probiotics nor advice to chew xylitol-based chewing gum was effective for managing pharyngitis. Trial registration: ISRCTN, no. ISRCTN51472596.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of probiotic yogurt and xylitol-containing chewing gums on reducing salivary Streptococcus mutans levels. STUDY DESIGN: This randomized clinical trial recruited 50 female students with over 105 colony forming units S. mutans per milliliter of their saliva. The participants were randomly allocated to two equal groups to receive either probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 andBifidobacteriumbifidum ATCC 29521 (200 g daily) or xylitol-containing chewing gums (two gums three times daily after each meal; total xylitol content: 5.58 g daily) for three weeks. At baseline and one day, two weeks, and four weeks after the interventions, saliva samples were cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar and salivary S. mutans counts were determined. Data were analyzed with independent t-tests, analysis of variance, and Fisher's least significant difference test. RESULTS: In both groups, S. mutans counts on the first day, second week, and fourth weeks after the intervention were significantly lower than baseline values (P < 0.05). The greatest level of reduction in both groups was observed in the second week after the intervention. Moreover, although the reduction was greater in probiotic yogurt consumers, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Probiotic yogurt and xylitol-containing chewing gums seem to be as effective in reduction of salivary S. mutans levels. Their constant long-term consumption is thus recommended to prevent caries.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: No studies have yet documented the bactericidal effects of TiF4, and its role in the treatment of dental caries, and no definite protocol has been introduced to regulate its use. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial/bactericidal effects of TiF4 on Streptococcus Mutans (S. Mutans) and to compare it with chlorhexidine (Chx), sodium fluoride (NaF) and xylitol. METHODS: This study was conducted at the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences microbiology laboratory during March 2015 to September 2015. In this in-vitro study, first a bacterial suspension was prepared and adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland standard (equivalent to 1×108 CFU/ml). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of TiF4, Chx, NaF and xylitol were assessed using broth microdilution assay and disk diffusion methods. In order to neutralize the acidic nature of TiF4, we used a sodium hydroxide preparation to obtain a pH of 7.2 and repeated all of the previous tests with the neutralized TiF4 solution. We reported the final results as percentages where appropriate. RESULTS: The MIC of TiF4, NaF and Chx for S. Mutans were 12.5%, 12.5% and 6.25%, respectively. At a concentration of 12.5% the inhibition zone diameters were 9 mm, 15mm and 14mm for TiF4, NaF and Chx, respectively. The MBC was 25%, 12.5% and 12.5% for TiF4, NaF and Chx, respectively. Xylitol failed to show any bactericidal or growth inhibitory effect in all of its concentrations. When we repeated the tests with an adjusted pH, identical results were obtained. CONCLUSION: TiF4 solutions have anti-growth and bactericidal effects on S. Mutans at a concentration of 12.5% which is comparable with chlorhexidine and NaF, indicating the possible use of this solution in dental practice as an anti-cariogenic agent, furthermore the antimicrobial activity is unaffected by pH of the environment."

Nasal NO and iNOS mRNA in the right maxillary sinus were also examined. Then, they were treated with XNI (XNI group) or saline nasal irrigation (SNI, SNI group) for 30days, after which their symptoms were reassessed using VAS and SNOT-22, and nasal NO and iNOS mRNA in the right maxillary sinus were also reexamined. RESULTS: Twenty-five out of 30 patients completed this study. The scores of VAS and SNOT-22 were all reduced significantly after XNI treatment, but not after SNI. The concentrations of nasal NO and iNOS mRNA in the right maxillary sinus were increased significantly in XNI group. However, significant changes were not found after SNI treatment. Furthermore, there were statistical differences in the assessments of VAS and SNOT-22 and the contents of nasal NO and iNOS mRNA in the right maxillary sinus between two groups.

METHODS: MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from January 1, 1995 through Sept. 26, 2016 for randomized and controlled trials on children consuming xylitol for at least 12 months. The primary endpoint was caries reduction measured by mean decayed, missing, and filled primary and permanent surfaces/ teeth (dmfs/t, DMFS/T, respectively). The I2 and chi-square test for heterogeneity were used to detect trial heterogeneity. Meta-analyses were performed and quality was evaluated using GRADE profiler software. RESULTS: Analysis of five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed that xylitol had a small effect on reducing dental caries (standardized mean difference [SMD] equals -0.24; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] equals -0.48 to 0.01; P = 0.06) with a very low quality of evidence and considerable heterogeneity. Studies with higher xylitol doses (greater than four grams per day) demonstrated a medium caries reduction (SMD equals -0.54; 95 percent CI equals -1.14 to 0.05; P = 0.07), with these studies also having considerable heterogeneity and very low quality of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review examining the effectiveness of xylitol on caries incidence in children showed a small effect size in randomized controlled trials and a very low quality of evidence that makes preventive action of xylitol uncertain.",

BACKGROUND: Following therapeutic irradiation of the head and neck, patients with profound xerostomia have complaints associated with oral dryness, speech, and taste. There is no strong evidence that any topical therapy is effective for relieving the symptom of dry mouth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 40 patients who had been treated with radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma and reported symptoms of dry mouth were included in the study. A xerostomia-related quality of life questionnaire, visual analogue scale questionnaire for subjective assessment of salivary dysfunction and salivary flow were reported before and 15 days after the use of topical products based on olive oil, betaina and xylitol. RESULTS: The four primary quality of life areas demonstrated significantly greater improvement after the use of topical products and all eight VAS items had favourable changes. The reduction of symptoms was statistically significant in 7 of the 8 items. After the use of the products, there were improvements in salivary flow in 45%. CONCLUSIONS: The use of products based on olive oil, betaine and xylitol, shaped like collutory, toothpaste, gel and spray significantly improved most symptoms and the quality of life limitations produced by dry mouth in patients treated with radiotherapy."

Erythritol effectively decreased weight of dental plaque and adherence of common streptococcal oral bacteria to tooth surfaces, inhibited growth and activity of associated bacteria like S. mutans, decreased expression of bacterial genes involved in sucrose metabolism, reduced the overall number of dental caries, and served as a suitable matrix for subgingival air-polishing to replace traditional root scaling. Conclusions. Important differences were reported in the effect of individual polyols on oral health. The current review provides evidence demonstrating better efficacy of erythritol compared to sorbitol and xylitol to maintain and improve oral health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common bacterial infection among young children in the United States. There are limitations and concerns over its treatment with antibiotics and surgery and so effective preventative measures are attractive. A potential preventative measure is xylitol, a natural sugar substitute that reduces the risk of dental decay. Xylitol can reduce the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) to nasopharyngeal cells in vitro. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of xylitol to prevent AOM in children aged up to 12 years. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (to Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2016), Embase (1974 to January 2016), CINAHL (1981 to January 2016), LILACS (1982 to January 2016), Web of Science (2011 to January 2016) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (2000 to January 2016). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of children aged 12 years or younger where xylitol supplementation was compared with placebo or no treatment to prevent AOM. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials from search results, assessed and rated study quality and extracted relevant data for inclusion in the review. We contacted trial authors to request missing data. We noted data on any adverse events of xylitol. We extracted data on relevant outcomes and estimated the effect size by calculating risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS: We identified five clinical trials that involved 3405 children for inclusion. For this 2016 update, we identified one new trial for inclusion. This trial was systematically reviewed but due to several sources of heterogeneity, was not included in the meta-analysis. The remaining four trials were of adequate methodological quality. In three RCTs that involved a total of 1826 healthy Finnish children attending daycare, there is moderate quality evidence that xylitol (in any form) can reduce the risk of AOM from 30% to around 22% compared with the control group (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88). Among the reasons for dropouts, there were no significant differences in abdominal discomfort and rash between the xylitol and the control groups. Xylitol was not effective in reducing AOM among healthy children during a respiratory infection (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.53; moderate quality evidence) or among otitis-prone healthy children (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.21; low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate quality evidence showing that the prophylactic administration of xylitol among healthy children attending daycare centres can reduce the occurrence of AOM. There is inconclusive evidence with regard to the efficacy of xylitol in preventing AOM among children with respiratory infection, or among otitis-prone children. The meta-analysis was limited because data came from a small number of studies, and most were from the same research group.",

Optimized conditions for corncob hemicellulose extraction by TBAH was obtained via response surface methodology: time of 90min, temperature of 60°C, liquid/solid ratio of 12 (v/w), and TBAH concentration of 55%, resulting in a hemicellulose extraction of 80.07% under these conditions.

There is a need to find more effective, non-antibiotic based therapies for CRS. This study examines the effects of xylitol on CRS biofilms and planktonic bacteria. METHODS: Crystal violet assay and spectrophotometry were used to quantify the effects of xylitol (5% and 10% solutions) against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The disruption of established biofilms, inhibition of biofilm formation and effects on planktonic bacteria growth were investigated and compared to saline and no treatment. RESULTS: Xylitol 5% and 10% significantly reduced biofilm biomass (S. epidermidis), inhibited biofilm formation (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) and reduced growth of planktonic bacteria (S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa). Xylitol 5% inhibited formation of S. epidermidis biofilms more effectively than xylitol 10%. Xylitol 10% reduced S. epidermidis planktonic bacteria more effectively than xylitol 5%. Saline, xylitol 5% and 10% disrupted established biofilms of S. aureus when compared with no treatment. No solution was effective against established P. aeruginosa biofilm. CONCLUSIONS: Xylitol has variable activity against biofilms and planktonic bacteria in vitro and may have therapeutic efficacy in the management of CRS.",

Additionally, we evaluated the immobilized efficiency (IE) of Candida tropicalis and xylitol fermentation yield by investigating the surface properties of nitric acid treated CF, specifically, the acidic group content, zero charge point, degree of moisture and contact angle. We found that adhesion is the major mechanism for cell immobilization and that it is greatly affected by the hydrophilic-hydrophilic surface properties. In our experiments, we found 3 hto be the optimal time for treating CF with nitric acid, resulting in an improved IE of Candida tropicalis of 0.98 g∙g-1 and the highest xylitol yield and volumetric productivity (70.13% and 1.22 g∙L-1∙h-1, respectively). The HNO₃-treated CF represents a promising method for preparing biocompatible biocarriers for multi-batch fermentation."

RESULTS: The nuclei of SMMC-7221 cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 in an apoptosis assay, and their morphology subsequently changed from circular to crescent shape. The calibration curve (r(2) = 0.992) was established, and GSH content markedly decreased after treated with 0.5 and 1 mg xylitol/selenite l(-1) for 12, 36 and 60 h (12 h: from 95.57 ± 19.57 to 29.09 ± 7.74 and 24.27 ± 11.15; 36 h: from 70.73 ± 11.35 to 19.54 ± 6.39 and 9.35 ± 6.69; 60 h: from 72.63 ± 16.94 to 7.432 ± 3.84 and 0). The depletion rate of GSH was more related to the concentration of xylitol/selenite than the treatment time (from 69.95 ± 1.87 to 100 % vs. 0.22 ± 0.2 to 100 %). CONCLUSIONS: Xylitol/selenite is a promising anti-cancer drug to induce apoptosis in SMMC-7221 cells. It may regulate the apoptosis through the co-action of multiple mechanisms related to GSH depletion.",

We report the development and successful treatment of acute hepatic failure and coagulopathy in a dog after xylitol ingestion. A 9-year-old 4.95 kg (10.9 lb) neutered male Chihuahua was evaluated at a veterinary clinic for vomiting after ingesting 224 g (45 g/kg, 20.5 g/lb) of granulated xylitol. Hypoglycemia developed within 1-2 h, elevated liver values, suggesting the development of acute hepatic failure, within 12 h and coagulopathy less than 24 h after ingestion. Treatment included maropitant, intravenous dextrose, phytonadione, metronidazole, and fresh frozen plasma. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and S-adensoyl-L-methionine (SAMe) provided hepatic detoxification and support. The dog survived and liver values returned to normal within 1 month post ingestion. No adverse effects to hepatic function have been identified 2 years after acute xylitol toxicity. This paper is one of the few reports of successful management of a dog with hypoglycemia, hepatic failure, and coagulopathy caused by xylitol toxicity. To date, this is the highest published xylitol dose survived by a dog, as well as the only reported case that documents laboratory changes throughout the course of toxicity and includes normal hepatic indices for 7 months following xylitol toxicity. The rapidly expanding use of xylitol in a variety of products intended for human consumption has led to a rise in xylitol toxicity cases reported in dogs, and clinicians should be aware that more dogs may potentially be exposed and develop similar manifestations.",

METHODS: The study was a pilot clinical trial that included 41 subjects who were undergoing orthodontic treatment. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups. Group A received xylitol chewing gum, group B received xylitol dissolvable chewable tablets, and Group C served as the control group and did not receive xylitol gums or tablets. Clinical examination and the collection of plaque and saliva samples were carried out at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. All three groups were given oral hygiene instruction and were put on a 6-month cleaning and topical fluoride schedule. Plaque scores and bacterial counts were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the different approaches at reducing the caries risk. RESULTS: Xylitol groups did not experience any more reduction in plaque score, plaque MS counts, or salivary MS counts than the control group nor did they have lower values at any of the time points. Chewing gum did not significantly increase the incidence of debonded brackets over the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Xylitol does not have a clinical or bacterial benefit in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. Oral hygiene instructions and 6-month topical fluoride application were effective at reducing plaque scores and bacterial counts in patients with full fixed appliances regardless of whether or not xylitol was used.",

METHODS: The experiments were performed on male SKH-1 hairless mice. The skin of the dorsal region was exposed to SLS (5%) for 3 h alone or together with 5% or 10% of glycerol respectively. Further two groups received xylitol solutions (8.26% and 16.52% respectively) using the same osmolarities, which were equivalent to those of the glycerol treatments. The control group was treated with purified water. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin hydration were determined. Microcirculatory parameters of inflammation were observed by means of intravital videomicroscopy (IVM). Furthermore, accumulation of neutrophil granulocytes and lymphocytes, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and SLS penetration were assessed, as well. RESULTS: Treatment with the 10% of glycerol and both concentrations of xylitol inhibited the SLS-induced elevation of TEWL and moderated the irritant-induced increase in dermal blood flow and in the number of leucocyte-endothelial interactions. All concentrations of the applied polyols improved hydration and prevented the accumulation of lymphocytes near the treatment site. At the mRNA level, neither glycerol nor xylitol influenced the expression of interleukin-1 alpha. However, expression of interleukin-1 beta was significantly decreased by the 10% glycerol treatment, while expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha decreased upon the same treatment, as well as in response to xylitol. Higher polyol treatments decreased the SLS penetration to the deeper layers of the stratum corneum. CONCLUSION: Both of the analysed polyols exert considerable anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory properties, but the effective concentration of xylitol is lower than that of glycerol.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To summarize the signalment, clinical signs, prevalence of decreased blood glucose concentration (BG), prevalence of increased liver values, treatment, and outcome in dogs known to have ingested xylitol. DESIGN: Retrospective study from December 2007 to February 2012 SETTING: Three university teaching hospitals. ANIMALS: One hundred ninety-two client-owned dogs with known or suspected xylitol ingestion. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The median ingested xylitol dose was 0.32 g/kg (range 0.03-3.64 g/kg). Clinical signs were present in 39 (20%) dogs on presentation to the veterinary teaching hospitals. The most common clinical sign was vomiting (n = 25), followed by lethargy (12). The median duration of clinical signs prior to presentation was 93 minutes (range 0-5,040 minutes). Dogs that developed clinical signs ingested a significantly higher dose of xylitol than those that were asymptomatic. Thirty dogs became hypoglycemic (BG ≤ 3.3 mmol/L [60 mg/dL]) at some time point during their hospitalization. When evaluating all dogs, there was a significant difference between the initial and lowest BGs. Thirty dogs had increased alanine aminotransferase activity or total serum bilirubin concentration. Dogs with increases in alanine aminotransferase activity or total serum bilirubin concentration had a significantly lower nadir BG. All dogs survived to discharge and 158 were known to be alive at 28 days. The rest were lost to follow up. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for dogs evaluated by a veterinarian that ingest lower doses of xylitol and do not develop liver failure is excellent. Dogs ingesting xylitol should be hospitalized and monitored for variations in BG, because BG drops in most dogs following presentation. Additional studies are needed in dogs ingesting higher doses of xylitol before correlations between dose and the development of clinical signs or liver failure can be established. Treatment and prognosis for these dogs warrants further investigation.",

      "abstract": "During xylitol fermentation, Candida tropicalis is often inhibited by inhibitors in hemicellulose hydrolysate. The mechanisms involved in the metabolic responses to inhibitor stress and the resistances to inhibitors are still not clear. To understand the inhibition mechanisms and the metabolic responses to inhibitors, a GC/MS-based metabolomics approach was performed on C. tropicalis treated with and without complex inhibitors (CI, including furfural, phenol and acetic acid). Partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to determine the metabolic variability between CI-treated groups and control groups, and 25 metabolites were identified as possible entities responsible for the discrimination caused by inhibitors. We found that xylose uptake rate and xylitol oxidation rate were promoted by CI treatment. Metabolomics analysis showed that the flux from xylulose to pentose phosphate pathway increased, and tricarboxylic acid cycle was disturbed by CI. Moreover, the changes in levels of 1,3-propanediol, trehalose, saturated fatty acids and amino acids showed different mechanisms involved in metabolic responses to inhibitor stress. The increase of 1,3-propanediol was considered to be correlated with regulating redox balance and osmoregulation. The increase of trehalose might play a role in protein stabilization and cellular membranes protection. Saturated fatty acids could cause the decrease of membrane fluidity and make the plasma membrane rigid to maintain the integrity of plasma membrane. The deeper understanding of the inhibition mechanisms and the metabolic responses to inhibitors will provide us with more information on the metabolism regulation during xylitol bioconversion and the construction of industrial strains with inhibitor tolerance for better utilization of bioresource.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 dental students of 20-25 years old, who volunteered after checking their health condition and signing an informed consent, were randomly allocated to receive one of the following interventions: (A) Chewing gum containing CPP-ACP; (B) containing xylitol. Subjects within the experimental groups were taken the gums 3 times daily, after each meal for a period of 3 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention unstimulated saliva samples were quantified for S. mutans counts. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction of salivary S. mutans was displayed in both groups A and B after the intervention when compared with baseline (P < 0.001), and group A shows more statistically significant reduction of salivary S. mutans than group B (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Daily consumption of chewing gum containing CPP-ACP and xylitol significantly reduces the level of salivary S. mutans, but chewing gum containing CPP-ACP can reduce the level of salivary S. mutans in more than xylitol chewing gum."

During the acid hydrolysis, undesirable by-products were generated, such as acetic acid, furfural, and low-molecular-weight phenols, which inhibit bioconversion of xylose to xylitol. These inhibitors were successfully removed from the hydrolyzate by sorption onto a steam-activated charcoal followed by treatment with an anion exchange resin.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dental caries is a highly prevalent chronic disease which affects the majority of people. It has been postulated that the consumption of xylitol could help to prevent caries. The evidence on the effects of xylitol products is not clear and therefore it is important to summarise the available evidence to determine its effectiveness and safety. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of different xylitol-containing products for the prevention of dental caries in children and adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 14 August 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 14 August 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 14 August 2014), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 14 August 2014), Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1990 to 14 August 2014), Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 14 August 2014). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of xylitol products on dental caries in children and adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We attempted to contact study authors for missing data or clarification where feasible. For continuous outcomes, we used means and standard deviations to obtain the mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI). We used the continuous data to calculate prevented fractions (PF) and 95% CIs to summarise the percentage reduction in caries. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs. As there were less than four studies included in the meta-analysis, we used a fixed-effect model. We planned to use a random-effects model in the event that there were four or more studies in a meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 studies that analysed a total of 5903 participants. One study was assessed as being at low risk of bias, two were assessed as being at unclear risk of bias, with the remaining seven being at high risk of bias.The main finding of the review was that, over 2.5 to 3 years of use, a fluoride toothpaste containing 10% xylitol may reduce caries by 13% when compared to a fluoride-only toothpaste (PF -0.13, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.08, 4216 children analysed, low-quality evidence).The remaining evidence on children, from small single studies with risk of bias issues and great uncertainty associated with the effect estimates, was insufficient to determine a benefit from xylitol products. One study reported that xylitol syrup (8 g per day) reduced caries by 58% (95% CI 33% to 83%, 94 infants analysed, low quality evidence) when compared to a low-dose xylitol syrup (2.67 g per day) consumed for 1 year.The following results had 95% CIs that were compatible with both a reduction and an increase in caries associated with xylitol: xylitol lozenges versus no treatment in children (very low quality body of evidence); xylitol sucking tablets versus no treatment in infants (very low quality body of evidence); xylitol tablets versus control (sorbitol) tablets in infants (very low quality body of evidence); xylitol wipes versus control wipes in infants (low quality body of evidence).There was only one study investigating the effects of xylitol lozenges, when compared to control lozenges, in adults (low quality body of evidence). The effect estimate had a 95% CI that was compatible with both a reduction and an increase in caries associated with xylitol.Four studies reported that there were no adverse effects from any of the interventions. Two studies reported similar rates of adverse effects between study arms. The remaining studies either mentioned adverse effects but did not report any usable data, or did not mention them at all. Adverse effects include sores in the mouth, cramps, bloating, constipation, flatulence, and loose stool or diarrhoea. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found some low quality evidence to suggest that fluoride toothpaste containing xylitol may be more effective than fluoride-only toothpaste for preventing caries in the permanent teeth of children, and that there are no associated adverse-effects from such toothpastes. The effect estimate should be interpreted with caution due to high risk of bias and the fact that it results from two studies that were carried out by the same authors in the same population. The remaining evidence we found is of low to very low quality and is insufficient to determine whether any other xylitol-containing products can prevent caries in infants, older children, or adults.",
