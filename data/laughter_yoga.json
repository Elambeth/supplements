      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laughter yoga has a positive effect on the person's mental/general health, life satisfaction and psychological well-being and enables the person to cope with stress. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled study was conducted to determine the effect of laughter yoga practiced by first year nursing students before clinical practice on their perceptions of stress and meaning of life. METHOD: In this experimental randomized and controlled study including a control group, we administered a pre-test, post-test one and post-test two to the participating students. Ninety nursing students who met the inclusion criteria comprised the study sample. The students in the intervention group took part in eight sessions of laughter yoga for four weeks, twice a week. The Descriptive Information Form, Perceived Stress Scale, and Meaning and Purpose of Life Scale were administered to collect the study data. RESULTS: The mean age of the students in the intervention and control groups was 19.65 ± 2.27 and 19.18 ± 1.01 years, respectively. Of the participants in both groups, 91.1% were women, and 97.8% were single. The difference between the mean scores obtained from the Perceived Stress Scale and the Meaning and Purpose of Life Scale by the students in the intervention group at the pre- and posttest were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Laughter yoga positively affects nursing students' perceptions of stress and meaning and purpose of life. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial Registration number and Date of registration: NCT06042959 / 09/14/2023 06:17."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of laughter yoga on hope and school burnout among secondary school, (eighth grade) students. This study was a pretest, posttest, parallel-group, randomized control trial to evaluate the effect of laughter yoga on hope and school burnout in eighth-grade students. The population of the study consisted of 60 eighth-grade middle school students (intervention group n=30 and control group n=30). Laughter yoga was practiced face-to-face with the intervention group twice a week for 35-40 minutes and in six sessions in total. The protocol of the study was registered with the number NCT05742308 (ClinicalTrials.gov). After laughter yoga, there was a statistically significant difference between the intervention (17.27 ± 8.76) and control (22.90 ± 7.08) groups in the mean scores of the school burnout scale (p < .05) and a statistically significant difference between the intervention (29.28 ± 5.66) and control (22.28 ± 5.65) groups in the mean scores of the children's hope scale (p < .05). School health nursing practices have an important role in the process of acquiring positive health behaviors in school-age children. They are able to use evidence-based practices to reduce student burnout and improve hope. Based on the results of the study, school health nurses can use laughter yoga to increase hope levels and decrease burnout levels in eighth-grade students."

Nonetheless, there is a dearth of research investigating the impact of laughter yoga (LY) on nursing students' well-being, perceived stress, and self-efficacy. The aim of this single-blinded, two-armed randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of LY on nursing students' well-being, perceived stress, and academic self-efficacy (ASE). A total of five sessions of LY were applied to the intervention group. The analysis included a total of 83 nursing students (intervention group n = 41 and control group n = 42). Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and paired-samples t-test were used for data analysis. Results revealed that the intervention group showed a significant increase in well-being (p < .001) and a decrease in perceived stress after LY (p < .01). However, statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups were not found in well-being, perceived stress, and ASE (p > .05). These results indicate the potential effects of LY on the students' well-being and perceived stress. Community mental health nurses and educators can use LY to improve well-being in universities.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This research was conducted to determine the effects of acupressure, laughter yoga, and a mindfulness-based stress reduction program applied to postmenopausal women for menopause symptoms and quality of life. METHODS: A randomized controlled design was used. The study was conducted with a total of 146 women, including 41 acupressure, 31 laughter yoga, 37 mindfulness-based stress reduction, and 37 control group women. The women in the acupressure group were administered acupressure twice a week, which accounted for 16 sessions in total. Women in the laughter yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction groups received a total of eight sessions of the related intervention, which was performed once a week. Study data were collected using a participant information form, the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), and the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Scale (MENQOL). Descriptive statistics, paired-samples t test, χ 2 test, analysis of variance test, and intention to treat analysis were used to analyze the data. Before the intention to treat analysis was performed, the multiple imputation method was employed to deal with missing data. RESULTS: In the study, it was found that there was a decrease in the MRS total score after the intervention in women in all three intervention groups compared to the control group ( P < 0.05). In the laughter yoga group, total MRS scores decreased by 3.16 points ( P < 0.05). In the acupressure group, total MRS scores decreased by 5.46 points ( P < 0.05). In the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program group, total MRS scores decreased by 4.65 points ( P < 0.05). It was determined that the mean scores of women in the laughter yoga and acupressure groups on all subscales of the MENQOL decreased after the intervention compared to the control group ( P < 0.05). The comparison of the MBSR group and the control group showed that there was a decrease only in the psychosocial domain subdimension of the MENQOL ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it was determined that laughter yoga, acupressure, and MBSR could be effective in reducing menopause symptoms and improving quality of life, although findings require further testing in a rigorously controlled study and in a study with only a single prespecified outcome.",

About 36 women who attend the Menopause School were randomized into either the laughter yoga (n = 18) or the control group (n = 18). The laughter yoga group participated in eight online laughter yoga sessions, with two sessions per week for four weeks, whereas the control group did not receive any intervention. Data were collected using the Descriptive Characteristics Form, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The laughter yoga group had significantly lower posttest VAS scores compared with the control group in all VMS ( P < .05). Furthermore, the posttest PSQI score of the laughter yoga group was significantly lower than that of the control group ( P < .05). Although there was no significant difference in the pretest and posttest scores obtained by the control group from the VAS and PSQI ( P > .05), the intervention group exhibited a statistically significant difference in their pretest and posttest VAS and PSQI scores ( P < .05; P < .001, respectively). The results indicate that laughter yoga is an effective method for reducing VMS and improving sleep quality."

METHOD: In this 3-arm randomized clinical trial, 91 depressed aged participants aged 60-75 years, referred to Rafsanjan health centers, were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The study followed a parallel group design with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The laughter yoga intervention was conducted twice a week for eight weeks, and music intervention consisted of 30-min sessions twice a week for eight weeks. The control group received no intervention ('No treatment' concurrent control). Assessments for depressive symptoms (primary outcome), anxiety, and stress were conducted at baseline, post-intervention, and one month after the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were analyzed in three groups included the laughter yoga intervention (n = 31), music intervention (n = 25), or control group (n = 28). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant decrease in depressive and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001) from pre-test to post-test and one-month follow-ups. The greatest impact of the intervention programs on stress was observed immediately after the intervention, but stress increased one month after the intervention programs (p = 0.125). CONCLUSION: Both laughter yoga and music interventions proved effective in improving depression, anxiety, and stress in aged individuals. However, laughter yoga intervention demonstrated a superior effect and better acceptance among elders.",

Even if they received hemodialysis (HD) treatment regularly, patients would experience many complications such as cardiovascular disease, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and a declining quality of life. Laughter Yoga has been reported to have many positive effects on patients with chronic illnesses. By removing or reducing stress, Laughter Yoga (LY) helps to improve patients' quality of life, Thus, they have a longer chance of survival. However, the effect of Laughter Yoga on HD patients is generally inconclusive. Objective is to evaluate LY's impact on HD patients. We searched electronic databases that included Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and clinical trial registries. The search period was from their inception to January 29, 2023. The search keywords included laughter therapy, laughter yoga, laugh, hemodialysis, dialysis, and renal dialysis. The systematic review included both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experiments studies. Three RCTs and three non-RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Laughter Yoga showed patients having improvement in several outcomes such as life quality, pain severity, sleep quality, subjective well-being, mood, depression, blood pressure, and vital capacity. A well-designed RCT will be developed to further test the potential benefits of LY for HD patients.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is associated with a group of emotional, behavioral, and somatic symptoms that occur during the menstrual cycle. Laughter yoga involves a combination of laughter exercises and breathing techniques derived from more traditional yoga practice. No previous studies have examined the effects of laughter yoga on the symptoms of PMS. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to assess the effectiveness of laughter yoga in coping with the premenstrual symptoms of women. DESIGN: The research team performed a pretest and posttest, quasi-experimental study. SETTING: The study took place in the nursing and midwifery departments at Marmara University, a state university located in Istanbul, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 80 female students in those departments at the university between February 2019 and May 2020 who had PMS. INTERVENTION: The research team divided participants into two groups based on their departments: (1) an intervention group, the laughter yoga group, with 32 participants who took part in a twice-weekly laughter yoga program that included a weekly 30-min group session consisting of laughter and deep breathing, and (2) a control group with 48 participants. OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team collected the data using the Demographic and Descriptive Information Form (DDIF), Premenstrual Syndrome Symptom Scale (PMSS), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). RESULTS: Between baseline and postintervention, the laughter yoga group's mean scores for the PMSS subdimensions depressive affection (P = .00), anxiety (P = .04), fatigue (P = .00), irritability (P = .01), depressive thoughts (P = .03), pain (P = .002), changes in sleep (P = .004), and bloating (P = .001) significantly decreased. The laughter yoga group's scores for fatigue (P = .03) and pain (P = .001) were significantly lower than those of the control group postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: Laughter yoga is a noninvasive complementary therapy that clinicians can use to reduce the PMS symptoms.",

Result: The Happiness Scale's means were compared between the groups before and after the intervention, and the results revealed a significant increase (p < 0.05). There was not a significant difference in the stress scale scores between both the groups following LG and clinical practice (t: -1.780; p = 0.081). However, the stress scores of the LG decreased significantly after the LY sessions were completed (b: 3.595; p = 0.001). Conclusion: LY can be an effective method to be used to help increase happiness and reduce the stress of nursing students for first-time entering clinical practice."

      "abstract": "OBJETIVE: Chemotherapy is a prevalent cancer treatment, often accompanied by debilitating side effects such as nausea and vomiting. This study explores the potential effectiveness of laughter yoga, a combination of exercise and voluntary laughter, in alleviating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. METHODS: This two-group randomized clinical trial was conducted on 69 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy at the Reza Chemotherapy and Oncology Center, Mashhad, Iran, in 2018. Patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. Both groups received routine self-care training, with the addition of four 20-min to 30-min laughter yoga sessions held immediately before one of their chemotherapy appointments for the intervention group only. Nausea and vomiting were assessed using the Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Emesis questionnaire at two stages, before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed with Chi-square, Independent-t, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, and McNemar tests using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). RESULTS: The mean age of patients in the intervention group was 49.0 ± 9.6 years, while in the control group, it was 45.2 ± 12.6 years. The intragroup comparison showed a statistically significant decrease in the severity and duration of nausea in the intervention group and a statistically significant increase in the severity and duration of nausea in the control group from pre-test to post-test (P < 0.05). The intergroup comparison showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of vomiting conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Laughter yoga demonstrates promise in improving chemotherapy-induced nausea, suggesting its potential recommendation for managing this distressing side effect. Further research is warranted to explore its broader application in cancer care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study (No. IRCT20180429039463N1) was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials on 21/08/2018."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the malignant tumor with the highest morbidity and mortality rate in China. Although chemotherapy is effective in improving clinical symptoms, it causes a variety of acute and chronic side effects, seriously aggravating the psychological stress of patients. Laughter Yoga as a new type of aerobic exercise can effectively reduce stress levels and increase positive mood in patients. This study aimed to examine the effects of laughter yoga on perceived stress, positive psychological capital, and exercise capacity in lung cancer patients. METHODS: This study was a randomized, single-blind, parallel-group trial. The study enrolled 84 lung cancer chemotherapy patients from a general hospital in central China. These patients were randomly allocated to control and intervention groups (n = 42 per group) after baseline assessments. Patients in the control group received routine care and those in the intervention group received laughter yoga intervention. Perceived stress, positive psychological capital, and exercise capacity were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention. RESULTS: During the implementation of the study, there were 2 dropouts in each of the intervention and control groups. Ultimately, 80 patients in the control and intervention groups completed the trial. Patients who received laughter yoga intervention had significantly higher scores in positive psychological capital (P < .01, Cohen's d = 0.692) and exercise capacity (P < .01, Cohen's d = 0.659). Discernible differences were also observed in perceived stress (P < .01, Cohen's d = 1.087) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that laughter yoga is an effective way and may produce beneficial effects on perceived stress, positive psychological capital and exercise capacity.",

DESIGN: This was randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 55 individuals with an ostomy who received care at Ankara University's I˙bni Sina Hospital Stoma Therapy Unit in Ankara, Turkey. Data were collected over a 2-month period (January and February 2020). METHODS: Participants were allocated into an intervention group (n = 27) who received a yoga therapy intervention and a control group (n = 28) who received no intervention via simple randomization. Demographic and pertinent clinical variables were obtained during a baseline visit in both groups, along with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Stoma-Quality of Life (Stoma-QOL) instruments. The intervention group received laughter yoga weekly over a period of 8 weeks. RESULTS: Mean scores on the PSQI and the Stoma-QOL at baseline were compared. Participants in the intervention had a significant decline in mean PSQI scores (6.85 vs 5.48, P = .044) indicating improvement in sleep quality following the intervention. Analysis revealed no significant difference in mean Stoma-QOL scores (P = .077). Control group participants had no significant difference in either mean PSQI or Stoma-QOL scores following data collection at the end of 8 weeks.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is associated with a wide range of physical and psychological side effects, so complementary and alternative therapies may be practiced as an independent treatment or combined with the standard ones to improve health-related quality of life of cancer patients. Laughter yoga has predominantly been used as a complementary therapy to enhance health and wellbeing of ordinary people and patients with chronic diseases. However, to date, few studies have evaluated the effects of this modern exercise on cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in clinical settings, to the best of the authors' knowledge. the present study aimed to investigate the effects of Laughter Yoga on the health-related quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: This study was a two-group randomized clinical trial on 69 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy at Reza Radiotherapy and Oncology Center, Iran in 2018. Patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group received laughter yoga for four sessions at one-week intervals. Each session consists of one part and lasts for 20-30 min. Patients' health-related quality of life was assessed before and after the laughter yoga sessions using Quality of Life Questionnaire European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3.0. SPSS Statistics (v.20 software was used to conduct Chi-square, independent t-test, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon and paired t-tests analyses of the data. RESULTS: The number of participants in intervention and control groups were 34 and 35, there was no significant difference of demographic and disease related characteristics and pre-intervention HRQOL between two groups. In the intervention group, there is significant difference between pre- and post-intervention scores (Mean ± Standard Deviation) of emotional functioning (12.99 ± 10.49), physical functioning (0.78 ± 6.08), role functioning (3.43 ± 7.97), fatigue (-8.82 ± 22.01), pain (-8.33 ± 11.78), sleep disturbance (-15.68 ± 18.77), and global health and quality of life (6.37 ± 5.04) (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in the control group. Participants reported no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A structured laughter yoga intervention in a hospital setting effectively improved health-related quality of life for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Benefits to many patients could be expected if this would become a part of routine care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (no.

      "abstract": "AIM: This study aimed to examine the effect of laughter yoga applied before simulation training on state anxiety, perceived stress levels, self-confidence and satisfaction in undergraduate nursing students. BACKGROUND: Clinical simulation-based teaching implied a revolution in nursing education. Along with the many opportunities that simulation offers, some disadvantages, such as anxiety and stress experienced during simulation scenarios, could affect students' satisfaction and self-confidence in learning. Therefore, laughter yoga could be an alternative method that reduces students' anxiety and stress levels and increases their self-confidence and satisfaction with simulation training. DESIGN: The study was designed as a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. SETTING: This study was conducted at a university in Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 88 undergraduate nursing students were randomized to the intervention group (n = 44) or control group (n = 44). METHODS: The intervention group participated in the laughter yoga sessions just before the clinical simulation scenario, while the control group only performed the simulation training. The researchers examined the effect of laughter yoga on state anxiety, perceived stress levels, self-confidence and satisfaction in learning before and after the intervention. Data were collected between January - February 2022. RESULTS: This study showed that the mean scores of state anxiety, perceived stress, mean pulse rate and arterial pressure of the intervention group were significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, there was also a significant group*time interaction between the groups on state anxiety, perceived stress, pulse, respiratory and mean arterial pressure scores (p < 0.05). Moreover, the mean scores of student satisfaction and self-confidence in the learning of the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings showed that laughter yoga helped nursing students reduce their state anxiety and perceived stress levels related to simulation training and improved their self-confidence and satisfaction with learning. Additionally, it enhanced the students' vital signs (including mean pulse rate and mean arterial pressure). These positive results are promising for using LY as an easy, safe and effective method to reduce undergraduate nursing students' stress and anxiety levels and to improve their learning satisfaction and self-confidence levels in clinical skills training such as simulation training.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laughter has been reported to have various health benefits. However, data on the long-term effects of laughter interventions on diabetes are limited. This study aimed to investigate whether laughter yoga can improve glycemic control among individuals with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In a single-center, randomized controlled trial, 42 participants with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group. The intervention consisted of a 12-week laughter yoga program. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body weight, waist circumference, psychological factors, and sleep duration were evaluated at baseline and week 12. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that participants in the laughter yoga group experienced significant improvements in HbA1c levels (between-group difference: -0.31%; 95% CI -0.54, -0.09) and positive affect scores (between-group difference: 0.62 points; 95% CI 0.003, 1.23). Sleep duration tended to increase in the laughter yoga group with a between-group difference of 0.4 hours (95% CI -0.05, 0.86; P = 0.080). The mean attendance rate for laughter yoga program was high (92.9%). CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week laughter yoga program is feasible for individuals with type 2 diabetes and improves glycemic control. These findings suggest that having fun could be a self-care intervention. Further studies with larger numbers of participants are warranted to better evaluate the effects of laughter yoga.

      "abstract": "Stress is one of the foremost contributors to the development of psychiatric diseases. Since the prevalence of stress-related complaints is increasing, we are in need for affordable and effective treatment alternatives. Laughter yoga (LY), a popular method encouraging participants to simulate laughter and participate in yogic breathing exercises, is hypothesized to buffer negative effects of stress. Although widely practiced, empirical evidence for beneficial effects of LY is scarce. We investigated the acute effects of a single 30-min LY session on the autonomic, endocrine and psychological response to a standardized psychosocial stressor. Thirty-five healthy subjects (51% female) were randomly assigned to experience either a LY (n = 11), a relaxation breathing (n = 12) or a (non-intervention) control (n = 12) session prior to their exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G). Salivary cortisol, salivary alpha amylase, and subjective stress were assessed repeatedly throughout the experiment. We expected that LY and relaxation breathing group each show a downregulation of stress response indices compared to the control group. Further, we expected that LY has beneficial effects compared to relaxation breathing. The groups did not differ in salivary cortisol, alpha amylase or subjective stress reactivity during the 30-min intervention. However, in response to the TSST-G, the LY, but neither the relaxation breathing, nor the control condition, showed an attenuated cortisol stress response. These findings highlight the potential of LY to buffer the endocrine stress response. Therefore, LY could be used as a cheap and easily-to-implement add-on to more traditional stress interventions. LAY SUMMARY In recent years, more and more people have reported to feel stressed. Although our body is well equipped to deal with acute stress, chronic stress can tire our system and contribute to illness in the long run. Therefore, we need affordable and effective measures to reduce stress. In this study we have investigated whether a single laughter yoga session can help us to deal with acute stress. Although laughter yoga did not change how stressful a situation was perceived, it reduced the amount of stress hormones that were released in response to the situation. As such, laughter yoga might be a cheap and easily-to-implement add-on to more traditional stress reduction interventions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. Patients with IBS usually suffer from anxiety and depression. A combination of psychological approaches and pharmacological treatments can be a significantly effective treatment for IBS. The main objective of the present study was to provide a therapeutic plan based on laughter yoga and anti-anxiety medication, employed for the very first time, and to determine the effectiveness of these treatments on the anxiety and GI symptoms of patients with IBS. METHODS In this randomized, controlled, clinical trial, the participants were 60 patients selected from those who referred to the GI clinic of Vali-asr Hospital (Birjand, Iran) during the study period (April 2017 to March 2017) and were diagnosed as having IBS based on ROME III criteria. The participants were randomly assigned to either the laughter yoga group, the anti-anxiety medication group, or the symptomatic treatment (control) group. Severity levels of anxiety and GI symptoms before and after intervention were determined and compared among these three groups according to approved protocols. RESULTS The severity of IBS symptoms after the interventions was more greatly reduced in the laughter yoga group than in the anti-anxiety medication and control groups (p = 0.006). The severity of anxiety after interventions decreased in all three groups, especially in the yoga treatment group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1). CONCLUSION Laughter yoga is more effective than anti-anxiety medication in reducing the GI symptoms of patients with IBS. Therefore, applying laughter yoga along with common pharmacological therapies for patients with IBS might be strongly advised."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laughter Yoga (LY) is a group-based intervention involving simulated laughter, gentle stretching, rhythmic breathing and meditation. There is some limited evidence that LY reduces depressive symptoms over the short term. However, the quality of previous LY studies is poor and none involved working-aged people with a clinical diagnosis of depression. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility and potential efficacy of LY for improving residual mood, anxiety and stress symptoms in adults diagnosed with depression. METHODS: Fifty participants were randomised to the group LY intervention (n = 23) consisting of eight sessions over four weeks, or treatment-as-usual (n = 27). Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Short Form 12 item Health Survey at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and at 3 months follow-up (T2). LY participants also completed a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ8) at T1 and eleven participated in individual qualitative interviews at T2. RESULTS: The LY group had statistically greater decreases in depression and improvements in mental health related quality of life compared to the control group from T0 to T1. The CSQ8 scores indicated a favourable level of satisfaction with the LY intervention. The qualitative interviews highlighted aspects of the intervention that were effective and those requiring modification. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the small sample size and treatment-as-usual control group. CONCLUSIONS: A full scale RCT of LY could be feasible if some modifications were made to the protocol/intervention. The intervention may be effective to improve depression and mental health related quality of life immediately post intervention.",

Salivary cortisol and DHEA levels were measured immediately before, immediately after, and 30 min after the intervention. RESULTS: Cortisol levels and C/D ratios significantly decreased by time in the LY and comedy movie groups. Significant group*time interactions were found between these two groups for cortisol levels and C/D ratios. DHEA levels did not change by time in the LY group. CONCLUSIONS: LY decreased cortisol levels and C/D ratios but did not affect DHEA levels. Simulated and spontaneous laughter differently affected the dynamics of cortisol levels and C/D ratios.

There has been no systematic review of laughter yoga intervention studies and thus evidence of its effects on mental health is unclear. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Laughter Yoga interventions improved depressive symptoms in two studies over the short term. There is a lack of good quality evidence to show that laughter yoga is more effective than other group-based interventions in improving mental health. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Well-conducted and clearly reported trials of laughter yoga are needed before the intervention can be considered as an evidence-based intervention to improve mental health. ABSTRACT: Introduction Laughter Yoga is claimed to promote mental health and is increasingly popular worldwide. Despite its popularity, there has been no systematic review of Laughter Yoga intervention studies and thus evidence of its effects on mental health is unclear. Aim This review aimed to critically evaluate the effects of group-based Laughter Yoga on improving mental health in adults. Method We conducted a systematic review of experimental studies (published from 1995 to 2017). Study quality was assessed, the effect sizes for individual mental health outcomes were calculated and all reviewed studies were narratively synthesized. Results Six experimental studies with inconsistent results were included in this review. The most promising effect of Laughter Yoga is the improvement of depressive symptoms, indicating significant medium-large effect sizes in two studies over the short term. The overall level of evidence was weak due to poor study quality and risks of bias. Discussion Laughter Yoga shows potential, but currently there is insufficient evidence to support its effectiveness in improving mental health when compared to other group-based interventions. Implications for practice This review highlights the need to conduct rigorous trials of laughter yoga before the intervention can be considered as an evidence-based intervention to improve mental health.",

Laughter has been shown to generally improve mood in physically healthy adults, and specifically in adults with heart disease or cancer, but little research exists regarding the impact of laughter in adults with Parkinson׳s disease. Low mood is frequently a co-morbid condition for adults with Parkinson׳s disease, and can negatively affect their caregivers. DESIGN: Pre-experimental (O1 × O2) pretest-posttest design. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Data collection occurred at six unique PD support groups in Southern California. SUBJECTS: Participants (N = 85) comprised a convenience sample of adults diagnosed with Parkinson׳s disease (n = 47) and accompanying caregivers (n = 38). INTERVENTION: Subjects participated in a 45-min Laughter Yoga (LY) session conducted by a Certified Laughter Yoga Teacher. OUTCOME MEASURES: This study utilized the Laughter Yoga \"How Do You Feel?\" (HDYF) form. The form consists of a series of 10 scales labeled \"well-being\" measures including enthusiasm, energy level, mood, optimism, stress level, level of friendship with group members, level of awareness about breathing, level of muscle relaxation, level of mental relaxation, and ability to laugh without a reason. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Paired sample t-tests reveal statistically significant improvements in well-being for adults with PD and their caregivers after attending an LY session. Therapists and other clinicians should consider utilizing this unique technique with adults with PD to address co-morbid low-mood conditions and include caregivers in the LY sessions for support and their own benefit.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laughter Yoga consists of physical exercise, relaxation techniques and simulated vigorous laughter. It has been associated with physical and psychological benefits for people in diverse clinical and non-clinical settings, but has not yet been tested in a haemodialysis setting. The study had three aims: 1) to examine the feasibility of conducting Laughter Yoga for patients with end stage kidney disease in a dialysis setting; 2) to explore the psychological and physiological impact of Laughter Yoga for these patients; and 3) to estimate the sample size required for future research. METHODS: Pre/post intervention feasibility study. Eighteen participants were recruited into the study and Laughter Yoga therapists provided a four week intradialytic program (30-min intervention three times per week). Primary outcomes were psychological items measured at the first and last Laughter Yoga session, including: quality of life; subjective wellbeing; mood; optimism; control; self-esteem; depression, anxiety and stress. Secondary outcomes were: blood pressure, intradialytic hypotensive episodes and lung function (forced expiratory volume). Dialysis nurses exposed to the intervention completed a Laughter Yoga attitudes and perceptions survey (n = 11). Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics v22, including descriptive and inferential statistics, and sample size estimates were calculated using G*Power. RESULTS: One participant withdrew from the study for medical reasons that were unrelated to the study during the first week (94 % retention rate). There were non-significant increases in happiness, mood, and optimism and a decrease in stress. Episodes of intradialytic hypotension decreased from 19 pre and 19 during Laughter Yoga to 4 post Laughter Yoga. There was no change in lung function or blood pressure. All nurses agreed or strongly agreed that Laughter Yoga had a positive impact on patients' mood, it was a feasible intervention and they would recommend Laughter Yoga to their patients. Sample size calculations for future research indicated that a minimum of 207 participants would be required to provide sufficient power to detect change in key psychological variables. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that Laughter Yoga is a safe, low-intensity form of intradialytic physical activity that can be successfully implemented for patients in dialysis settings. Larger studies are required, however, to determine the effect of Laughter Yoga on key psychological variables.

Students of medical sciences universities, especially nursing students, are under various stresses in clinical environment, in addition to the stress they experience in theoretical education environment. With regard to the importance of nursing students' general health and considering the various existing strategies to promote general health components, use of complementary treatments is more considered because of their better public acceptance, low costs, and fewer complications. One of the new strategies in this regard is laughter Yoga. The present study was conducted with an aim to define the effect of laughter Yoga on general health among nursing students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a quasi-experimental two-group three-step study conducted on 38 male nursing students in the nursing and midwifery school of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2012. In the study group, eight 1 h sessions of laughter Yoga were held (two sessions a week), and in the control group, no intervention was conducted. The data of the present study were collected by Goldberg and Hiller's General Health Questionnaire and analyzed by SPSS version 12. RESULTS: The findings showed a significant difference in the mean scores of general health before and after laughter Yoga intervention in the two groups of study and control. CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that laughter Yoga had a positive effect on students' general health and improved the signs of physical and sleep disorders, lowered anxiety and depression, and promoted their social function. Therefore, laughter Yoga can be used as one of the effective strategies on students' general health."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Research shows that laughter has myriad health benefits, yet the medical community has not implemented it formally as a treatment. Patients awaiting organ transplantation have significant physical disabilities and are at risk for psychological distress. Attenuated heart rate variability (HRV) is a risk factor for a negative long-term outcome in some patients. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to evaluate the clinical utility of laughter yoga in improving psychological and physiological measures in outpatients awaiting organ transplantation. Positive results would indicate promising areas to pursue in a follow-up study. DESIGN: Six participants met for 10 sessions over 4 weeks. The research team measured each participant's heart rate, HRV, blood pressure (BP), and immediate mood before and after the laughter and control interventions. The team assessed participants' longer-term mood (anxiety and depression) at the study's initiation, after a no-treatment control week, and at the end of the study. SETTING: The study occurred at the Department of Surgery and Medicine at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients awaiting transplants (three heart and three lung), two women and four men (ages 51-69 y). Participants had received no major surgery in the 3 months prior to the intervention, did not have a hernia or uncontrolled hypertension, and did not fall into the New York Heart Association function class 4. INTERVENTION: The 20-minute laughter intervention involved breathing and stretching exercises, simulated laughter (ie, unconditional laughter that is not contingent on the environment), chanting, clapping, and a meditation. The 20-minute control intervention involved the study's personnel discussing health and study-related topics with the participants. OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team measured BP, heart rate, and HRV and administered the Profile of Mood States, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II to evaluate immediate and longer-term mood. The team had planned quantitative statistical analysis of the data at the study's initiation but did not complete it because the number of enrolled participants was too low for the analysis to be meaningful. The team visually examined the data, however, for trends that would indicate areas to examine further in a follow-up study. RESULTS: Participants showed improved immediate mood (vigor-activity and friendliness) and increased HRV after the laughter intervention. Both the laughter and control interventions appeared to improve longer-term anxiety. Two participants awaiting a lung transplant dropped out of the study, and no adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that laughter yoga may improve HRV and some aspects of mood, and this topic warrants further research.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laughter Yoga founded by M. Kataria is a combination of unconditioned laughter and yogic breathing. Its effect on mental and physical aspects of healthy individuals was shown to be beneficial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Kataria's Laughter Yoga and group exercise therapy in decreasing depression and increasing life satisfaction in older adult women of a cultural community of Tehran, Iran. METHODS: Seventy depressed old women who were members of a cultural community of Tehran were chosen by Geriatric depression scale (score>10). After completion of Life Satisfaction Scale pre-test and demographic questionnaire, subjects were randomized into three groups of laughter therapy, exercise therapy, and control. Subsequently, depression post-test and life satisfaction post-test were done for all three groups. The data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and Bonferroni's correction. RESULTS: Sixty subjects completed the study. The analysis revealed a significant difference in decrease in depression scores of both Laughter Yoga and exercise therapy group in comparison to control group (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). There was no significant difference between Laughter Yoga and exercise therapy groups. The increase in life satisfaction of Laughter Yoga group showed a significant difference in comparison with control group (p<0.001). No significant difference was found between exercise therapy and either control or Laughter Yoga group. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that Laughter Yoga is at least as effective as group exercise program in improvement of depression and life satisfaction of elderly depressed women.",
