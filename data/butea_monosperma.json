      "abstract": "Nature is a valuable resource, supplying remedies for the treatment of all diseases. Plant kingdom stands for a plethora of natural compounds that are well known for their utilization in therapeutic applications. They may pave the way for the development of new mediators with appropriate efficacy in many pathological disorders in the future. In India and throughout the world, herbs have become a principle and popular medicine. Recognized green medicines are better than synthetic ones and have fewer side effects. Since ancient times, plants have been intended for their medicinal properties for treating various diseases owing to their fewer side effects, availability of the agent, cost-efficiency, and potential effectiveness. The medicinal value of plants stems from various vegetative parts of the plant, including flowers, fruit, bark, roots, leaves, seeds, and its modified parts. The Indian forests are the major repository of remedial and aromatic medicinal plants, which can be used for the production of a plethora of remedies against various diseases. Butea monosperma is one of the traditional Ayurvedic medicinal plants considered a rich source of ingredients that can be used in drug development as home remedies to treat various diseases, such as diarrhea, constipation, hypertension, dehydration, bronchial asthma, leucorrhea, cancer, infection, as well as liver and stomach disorders. The seed powder is known for its notable medicinal, pharmaceutical, and insecticidal activities. This study highlights the traditional Ayurvedic importance of an eminent medicinal plant, B. monosperma, with its active chemical constituents, as well as pharmacological, environmental, ecological, economical, and agricultural significance. This plant can be planted everywhere to take advantage of its versatile applications.",

      "abstract": "The incompetence of conventional antibiotics against bacteria residing in biofilms demands newer therapeutic intervention. In this study, we demonstrated that the interaction between silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and Butea monosperma seed lectin (BMSL) forms efficient surface-functionalized AgNPs with excellent antibiofilm competency against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) of AgNPs and the BMSL-AgNP conjugate (BAgNP) against UPEC was 75 and 9.37 μM, respectively. The eight-fold reduction in the MBIC of AgNPs was attributed to lectin functionalization. The chemical modification of serine amino acids affects the hemagglutination activity of BMSL but not its interaction with the AgNPs. At the same time, AgNPs surface-functionalized with modified BMSL display poor antibiofilm activity. Molecular docking studies revealed that BMSL binds to galactose with a free energy of -5.72 kcal/mol, whereas the serine residue-modified BMSL showed the lowest free energy values, suggesting incompetence for binding galactose. These results showcase that the sugar binding site of BMSL aids in the adhesion of AgNPs to the biofilm matrix and disturbs the formation of the biofilm, which was confirmed by light microscopy using crystal violet staining. At 37.5 μM, BAgNPs also have the capability to eradicate preformed biofilm. As a proof of concept, UPEC biofilm prevention and eradication were demonstrated on a urinary catheter. A scanning electron microscopy study showed that BAgNPs prevent bacterial colonization and thereby curtail biofilm growth. In addition to antibiofilm activity, BAgNPs exert antibacterial activity at 18.75 μM, which is four-fold lower than the MIC of AgNPs. A mechanistic study revealed that BAgNPs affect the integrity of the bacterial outer membrane and generate an imbalance in the antioxidant defense, which induces cell death. The results highlight that lectin functionalization can be extended to other nanoparticles and different antibiotics to enhance their efficacy against drug-resistant bacteria.",

However, the information available on DNA-protective and anti-proliferative potential of bark of this tree is scarce. In the present study, the extract/fractions obtained from bark of B. monosperma were evaluated for antioxidant, DNA-protective, and anti-proliferative activities, along with their phytochemical profiling for identifying major constituents present in them. Different extract/fractions, namely, Bmth (methanol), Bhex (hexane), Bchl (chloroform), and Beac (ethyl acetate), were prepared and evaluated for antioxidant activity using in vitro assays. Extract/fractions were also evaluated for anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity in human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, using in vitro assays, namely, MTT, clonogenic, and neutral comet assay, along with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Among all extract/fractions, a pronounced antioxidant activity was exhibited by Bchl and Beac fractions, in DPPH· (EC50 213.2 and 161.5 µg/mL, respectively), ABTS+· (EC50 139.3 and 44.1 µg/mL, respectively), and reducing power assay (EC50 86.7 and 84.5 µg/mL, respectively). Both fractions protected plasmid DNA against hydroxyl radical induced damage in plasmid nicking assay. Bchl and Beac were also observed to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells (GI50 203.7 and 246.5 µg/mL, respectively). Both fractions induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, by arresting the cell cycle in G1 and sub-G1 phase, respectively, enhancing ROS levels, decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and inducing double-strand DNA breaks. HPLC analysis revealed high kaempferol content in Bchl, and catechin, epicatechin, and gallic acid in Beac.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of joint dysfunction, disability and poor quality of life in the affected population. The underlying mechanism of joint dysfunction involves increased oxidative stress, inflammation, high levels of cartilage extracellular matrix degrading proteases and decline in autophagy-a mechanism of cellular defense. There is no disease modifying therapies currently available for OA. Different parts of the Butea monosperma (Lam.) plant have widely been used in the traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine system for the treatment of various human diseases including inflammatory conditions. Here we studied the chondroprotective effect of hydromethanolic extract of Butea monosperma (Lam.) flowers (BME) standardized to the concentration of Butein on human OA chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β. METHODS: The hydromethanolic extract of Butea monosperma (Lam.) (BME) was prepared with 70% methanol-water mixer using Soxhlet. Chondrocytes viability after BME treatment was measured by MTT assay. Gene expression levels were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using TaqMan assays and immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Autophagy activation was determined by measuring the levels of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) by immunoblotting and visualization of autophagosomes by transmission electron and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: BME was non-toxic to the OA chondrocytes at the doses employed and suppressed the IL-1β induced expression of inerleukin-6 (IL-6) and matrix metalloprotease-3 (MMP-3), MMP-9 and MMP-13. BME enhanced autophagy in chondrocytes as determined by measuring the levels of LC3-II by immunoblotting and increased number of autophagosomes in BME treated chondrocytes by transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. BME upregulated the expression of several autophagy related genes and increased the autophagy flux in human OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions. Further analysis revealed that BME activated autophagy in chondrocytes via inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Of importance is our finding that BME-mediated suppression of IL-1β induced expression of IL-6, MMP-3, -9, and -13 was autophagy dependent and was abrogated by inhibition of autophagy. CONCLUSION: The above results show that the Butea monosperma (Lam.) extract has strong potential to activate autophagy and suppress IL-1β induced expression of IL-6 and MMP-3, -9 and -13 in human OA chondrocytes. This study shows that BME or compounds derived from BME can be developed as safe and effective chondroprotective agent(s) that function by activating autophagy to suppress the expression of inflammatory and catabolic factors associated with OA pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "For thousands of years, the plant-based natural products have been a source of curative agents for various ailments. Butea monosperma (Fabaceae) has an important place in Indian traditional system of medicine for curing number of disorders. The present study deals with evaluation of hepatoprotective properties of ethyl acetate fraction (Beac) from B. monosperma bark in rat model. In preliminary antioxidant studies, Beac demonstrated pronounced superoxide scavenging (IC50 88.85μg/ml) and anti-lipid peroxidation (IC50 131.66μg/ml) potential. In animal studies, Beac showed protective effect against thioacetamide-induced pathophysiology in liver of male Wistar rats. The levels of different parameters related to hepatic functions were altered by thioacetamide treatment (300mg/g bw) in rats. The pre-treatment of rats with Beac (50, 100 and 200mg/kg bw) was able to normalize the biochemical markers viz. serum bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT, albumin and ALP along with liver antioxidative molecules viz. SOD, CAT, GSH and GR. Results of histopathological and colorimetric studies revealed that Beac treatment also restored the markers of fibrosis i.e. collagen and hydroxyproline towards normal level. Beac considerably inhibited thioacetamide-induced expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt and p-mTOR in hepatocytes as revealed from immunohistochemical studies. This finding is the first evidence of inhibitory action of B. monosperma bark on these pro-carcinogenic proteins. HRMS analysis revealed the presence of quercetin, buteaspermin B and ononin in Beac fraction of Butea monosperma. From the results, it can be concluded that B. monosperma bark is a rich source of phytochemicals with in vitro and in vivo protective activities which deserves further mechanistic studies for its use as a hepatoprotective agent in the prevention of hepatic inflammation and its related malignancies.",

      "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to investigate antioxidant, antigenotoxic, and antiproliferative activity of butanol fraction (Bmbu) from bark of medicinal plant Butea monosperma. Antioxidant potency of Bmbu was examined by various in vitro assays. It was also investigated for antigenotoxic activity using Escherichia coli. PQ37 employing SOS chromotest. Further, cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing activity of Bmbu was evaluated in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Bmbu showed potent free radical scavenging ability in ABTS assay (IC50 56.70 μg/ml) and anti-lipid peroxidation ability (IC50 40.39 μg/ml). 4NQO and H2 O2 induced genotoxicity was suppressed by Bmbu in SOS chromotest by 74.26% and 82.02% respectively. It also inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells with GI50 value of 158.71 μg/ml. Induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by Bmbu treatment was deciphered using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and neutral comet assay. Bmbu treatment increased cell population in sub-G1 phase (69.6%) indicating apoptotic cells. Further, Bmbu treatment resulted in increased reactive oxygen species generation and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential indicating involvement of mitochondrial dependent pathway of apoptosis. HPLC profiling showed the presence of polyphenols such as ellagic acid, catechin, quercetin, and gallic acid as its major constituents. Consequently, it is suggested that the phytoconstituents from this plant may be further exploited for development of novel drug formulation with possible therapeutic implication.",

It possesses antioxidant and anticancer activity which is a prerequisite for anticlastogenic activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Butea monosperma leaf extracts on cyclophosphamide induced clastogenicity and oxidative stress in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study assessed the role of aqueous and ethanolic leaf extracts of B. monosperma (AQEBM and ETEBM) on cyclophosphamide (CP) induced oxidative stress and DNA damage in mice using micronucleus assay for anticlastogenic activity and biochemical estimation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) for antioxidant activity. The frequency of the micronucleated erythrocytes and mitotic index was studied in peripheral blood and bone marrow after 24 and 48 h of clastogenic exposure. RESULTS: CP treatment led to a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the frequency of micronuclei and decrease in the mitotic index (MI) in bone marrow and peripheral blood cells. Moreover, CP also significantly increased the lipid peroxidation as evidenced by an increase in the MDA content and decreased the antioxidant enzyme (GSH) in mice liver. Pretreatment with AQEBM and ETEBM reduced the frequency of micronuclei and increased the MI in the bone marrow and peripheral blood cells and also restored the MDA and GSH levels in mice liver. CONCLUSION: The AQEBM and ETEBM do contain compounds capable of inhibiting the CP induced oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage in both the peripheral blood and bone marrow cells in mice."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Butea monosperma was collected from local forest of Jabalpur and extracted with ethanol. Healthy adult male Wistar albino rats between 5 and 6 months of age and weighing about 150-200 g were used for the study. Acute toxicity studies were performed to determine dose of extract. Nephrotoxicity was induced by gentamicin. Animals were divided in four groups in which first group served as positive control, second group as gentamicin treated toxic control; animals of group three and four were treated with Butea monosperma extract. Extract was administered to animals via oral route. Serum creatinine, serum urea, and blood urea nitrogen were estimated. Body weight was also determined. Histopathological studies were performed to access gross anatomical changes in animals. RESULTS: The extract of Butea monosperma was found to be rich in flavonoids, polyphenolics, and alkaloids. Urine creatinine, serum urea, and blood urea nitrogen were found to be significantly (P < 0.001) increased in rats treated with only gentamicin; whereas, treatment with the ethanolic extract of leaf of Butea monosperma reversed the effect of gentamicin indicating nephroprotective activity. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that ethanolic extract of Butea monosperma is a good source of phytochemicals. The phytoconstituents flavonoids, phenolics, and alkaloids present in the extracts may be responsible for antioxidant activity. By the virtue of antioxidant activity, Butea monosperma demonstrated nephroprotective activity.",

      "abstract": "Females of lac insects especially of Kerria lacca (Kerr) secret a resin known as lac for their own protection, which has tremendous applications. Lac insect completes its lifecycle on several host taxa where it exclusively feeds on phloem sap but Schleichera oleosa (Lour.) Oken, Butea monosperma (Lam.) and Ziziphus mauritiana (Lam.) are its major hosts. Analysis of phloem sap constituents as well as hemolymph of lac insect is important because it ultimately gets converted into lac by insect intervention. Main phloem sap constituent's viz. sugars and free amino acids and hemolymph of lac insect were analyzed using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The results were transformed to relative percentage of the total sugars and free amino acids analyzed in each sample for comparison among lac insect hemolymph and the phloem sap of the three different host taxa. Sucrose (58.9 ± 3.6-85.6 ± 0.9) and trehalose (62.3 ± 0.4) were the predominant sugars in phloem sap of three taxa and hemolymph of lac insect, respectively. Glutamic acid (33.1 ± 1.4-39.8 ± 1.4) was found to be main amino acid among the phloem sap of three taxa while tyrosine (61 ± 2.6) was the major amino acid in hemolymph of lac insect. The relative percentage of non-essential amino acids (60.8 %-69.9 %) was found to be more in all the three host taxa while essential amino acids (30.1 %-35.4 %) were present at a lower relative percentage. In contrast to this, the relative percentage of essential amino acids (81.9 %) was observed to be higher as compared to non-essential amino acids (17.7 %) in lac insect hemolymph. These results led to the detection of lac insect's endosymbionts. Moreover, this study revealed a clue regarding the importance of development of a synthetic diet for this insect so that a precise pathway of lac biosynthesis could be investigated for thorough understanding."

      "abstract": "With a longitudinally designed study, we tested whether an acetone soluble fraction (ASF) from the stem bark of Butea monosperma resulted in maximizing bone gain in rats during growth and maturation and thus protected against osteopenia following ovariectomy (OVx) with concomitant treatment withdrawal. Female rats at weaning were given ASF (100 mg/kg/d) or vehicle for 12 weeks, and baseline skeletal parameters (micro-CT) and total plasma antioxidant status (TAS) were measured. At this stage, one group was OVx and the other group was sham operated. Vehicle group (untreated) after OVx was given E2 or continued with vehicle (OVx control). ASF group after OVx was given vehicle (ASF withdrawn, ASFW). After another 12 weeks, all groups were killed and various skeletal parameters were determined. ASF resulted in substantially better skeletal parameters and higher plasma TAS over control at maturity. Rats treated with ASF before OVx had reduced rates of bone loss compared to OVx control. Twelve weeks after OVx, the ASFW group exhibited better trabecular microarchitectural preservation, bone turnover profiles, increased cortical deposition, and biomechanical strength over the OVx control, and the effects were comparable to OVx + E2 group. ASF supplementation during skeletal growth could maximize bone accrual and could confer increased resistance to post-OVx osteopenia despite treatment withdrawal."

To understand the pharmacological basis of its beneficial effects, the extracts of dried flowers in water, methanol, butanol, ethyl acetate and acetone were evaluated for free radical scavenging and pro-apoptotic activities in cell cultures (human hepatoma Huh-7 cell line and immortalized AML-12 mouse hepatocytes). Butrin and butein -the active constituents of flower extracts- were used as reference molecules. The levels of cell injury markers like lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione and lipid peroxidation and primary antioxidant enzymes glutathione S-transferase and catalase were also measured. The aqueous and butanolic extracts exhibited better 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging and cytotoxic activities in hepatoma cells than in immortalized hepatocytes. Interestingly, butein inhibited 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical better than butrin. The aqueous and butanolic extracts were further investigated for hepatoprotection against carbon tertrachloride-induced biochemical changes and cell death. Both extracts, just as butrin and butein, significantly reversed the cellular glutathione levels and lipid peroxidation, and glutathione-S-transferase activity. Lactate dehydrogenase leakage and cell death were also prevented. However, only butein revived the catalase activity. Thus, the butein content of Butea monosperma flower extracts is important for free radical scavenging activity, apoptotic cell death and protection against oxidative injury in hepatic cells.",

Alloxan administration resulted in higher blood glucose level and reduced hepatic glycogen content as compared to normal animals. Besides, serum lipid profile parameters such as total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol were also found to be significantly elevated, whereas the level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was markedly reduced in diabetic animals. Oxidative damage in the tissues of diabetic mice was evidenced by a marked increase in the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), distinct decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) content and declined activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). The daily treatment of diabetic animals with crude extract of B. monosperma bark (300 mg kg(-1)) for 45 days significantly lowered blood glucose level and elevated hepatic glycogen content, bringing the values close to those observed in normal control and glibenclamide-treated diabetic mice. Furthermore, the level of various lipid profile parameters was also reversed towards normal. TBARS and GSH also restored towards normal and the declined activity of antioxidant enzymes in diabetic animals was also normalized in crude extract administered mice, thus indicating the antioxidant efficacy of the drug in diabetes-induced oxidative damage. Significant antihyperglycemic and antioxidant potential of the crude extract of B. monosperma bark indicated that it may find use in the management of diabetes and resultant oxidative stress.",

Butea monosperma Lam. Kuntze (Fabaceae), commonly known as palash, is widely used in the treatment of various diseases and disorders including diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was planned to evaluate the antidiabetic effect of aqueous extracts of B. monosperma leaves and bark in streptozotocin-induced severely diabetic rats. The animals were divided into four groups, with each consisting of six rats, viz. control, diabetic control, leaf extract-treated and bark extract-treated groups. Treatment was continued for 6 weeks. The biochemical estimations included blood glucose and serum insulin levels. Histopathology of pancreas was also performed. RESULTS: The results indicated that both leaf and bark extracts of B. monosperma produced insignificant antihyperglycemic activity. The leaf and bark extracts reduced blood glucose to an extent of 28% and 11%, respectively. It was also evidenced that both leaf and bark extracts did not increase insulin synthesis or secretion and did not improve pancreatic architecture as reflected by the histopathologic studies. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study emphasize that B. monosperma does not possess significant antidiabetic activity in severe experimental diabetes at the dosage tested."

However, amongst the 6 isolated compounds, 3 compounds (C1, C4 and C6) appreciably subsided the exaggerated level of FBG. Simultaneously, glibenclamide, BE, C4 and C6 treatment markedly enhanced the hepatic glycogen content as compared to diabetic control group. Administration of crude extract, C4, C5 and C6 also exerted a protective effect on the declined activity of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px in the three tissues. However, all the herbal treatments produced a pronounced escalation in GSH content. Contrarily the elevated level of hepatic, pancreatic and renal TBARS monitored in diabetic animals was significantly diminished in treated groups of animals. Alloxan administration severely deteriorated the structure of liver and pancreas of diabetic mice, which was found to be restored to a certain extent in glibenclamide, BE and C6 treated animals. Identification of the most potent antihyperglycemic compound C6 by HPLC confirmed its triterpene nature. C6 was then further characterized via various spectroscopic methods (IR, NMR and Mass) that revealed its similarity with laccijalaric ester-I, a triterpene present in soft resin of B. monosperma seeds.",

This study evaluated the hepatoprotective and antitumorigenic properties of the aqueous extract and butanol fractions of B. monosperma flowers in animal models. Dried flowers of B. monosperma were extracted with water and fractionated further using n-butanol. The hepatoprotective activity of the aqueous extract was initially confirmed in a carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage model of rats. Oral administration of the aqueous extract produced a strong hepatoprotective effect similar to silymarin and normalized the serum levels of ALT, AST, bilirubin and triglyceride in rats. However, it did not affect the levels of glutathione and malondialdehyde which are oxidative stress markers in liver. Intraperitoneal administration of the aqueous extract in the X15-myc oncomice not only maintained liver architecture and nuclear morphometry but also down-regulated the serum VEGF levels. Immunohistochemical staining of liver sections with anti-Ribosomal protein S27a antibody showed post-treatment abolition of this proliferation marker from the tumor tissue. The butanol fractions, however, did not show antitumorigenic activity. Thus, the aqueous extract of B. monosperma flowers is not only hepatoprotective but also antitumorigenic by preserving the nuclear morphometry of the liver.",

METHODS: BTE (1.0 g kg d) and ASF (100 mg kg d) were given orally for 12 weeks to adult OVx rats. The sham-operated and ovariectomy + vehicle groups served as controls. Bone mineral density, osteoid formation (mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate), bone microarchitecture, and bone turnover/resorption markers were studied. Phytoestrogens in rats given BTE and ASF were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. One-way analysis of variance was used to test significance of effects. RESULTS: OVx rats treated with either BTE or ASF exhibited increased bone mineral density in trabecular bones and improved trabecular microarchitecture compared with the ovariectomy + vehicle group. ASF treatment was more efficient than BTE treatment in maintaining trabecular microarchitecture. Serum osteocalcin and urinary type 1 collagen levels in OVx rats treated with either BTE or ASF were significantly lower than those of the ovariectomy + vehicle group. ASF treatment led to increased mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate compared with ovariectomy + vehicle, whereas BTE had no such effect. In the uterotropic assay, BTE was mildly estrogenic in adult OVx rats. In immature rats, BTE exhibited both estrogenicity and antiestrogenicity. ASF had neither uterine estrogenicity nor antiestrogenicity. Analysis of phytoestrogens revealed significant enrichment of cladrin, isoformononetin, and medicarpin in ASF over BTE. CONCLUSIONS: Derived from B monosperma, ASF at a 10-fold lower dose than that of BTE was effective in preventing OVx-induced bone loss and stimulated new-bone formation.",

The chemopreventive and anti-angiogenic effects of the extract were evaluated by its daily oral administration in a HBV-related X15-myc mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). RESULTS: Treatment with the aqueous extract inhibited cell proliferation and accumulation of cells in G1 phase. This was accompanied by a marked reduction in the levels of activated Erk1/2 and SAPK/JNK and induction of apoptotic cell death. Oral administration of the extract in transgenic mice conferred hepatoprotection as is evident from normal serum ALT levels and improved liver histopathology and lowered serum VEGF level. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of aqueous extract of Butea monosperma flowers to impose growth arrest and trigger pro-apoptotic death in cell culture strongly correlated with its strong chemopreventive effect in vivo when given orally.",

      "abstract": "Activation of mast cells in rheumatoid synovial tissue has often been associated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 production and disease pathogenesis by adjacent cell types. Butea monosperma (BM) is a well known medicinal plant in India and the tropics. The aim of this study was to examine whether a standardized extract of BM flower (BME) could inhibit inflammatory reactions in human mast cells (HMC) using activated HMC-1 cells as a model. Four previously characterized polyphenols--butrin, isobutrin, isocoreopsin, and butein--were isolated from BME by preparative thin layer chromatography, and their purity and molecular weights were determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Our results showed that butrin, isobutrin, and butein significantly reduced the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore A23187-induced inflammatory gene expression and production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 in HMC-1 cells by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB. In addition, isobutrin was most potent in suppressing the NF-kappaB p65 activation by inhibiting IkappaBalpha degradation, whereas butrin and butein were relatively less effective. In vitro kinase activity assay revealed that isobutrin was a potent inhibitor of IkappaB kinase complex activity. This is the first report identifying the molecular basis of the reported anti-inflammatory effects of BME and its constituents butrin, isobutrin, and butein. The novel pharmacological actions of these polyphenolic compounds indicate potential therapeutic value for the treatment of inflammatory and other diseases in which activated mast cells play a role.",

Moreover, the level of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were also lowered, whereas the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which was reduced in untreated diabetic animals, was significantly elevated. Oxidative damage in the liver, pancreas and kidneys of diabetic mice as evidenced by a marked increment in the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and also a distinct diminution in glutathione content was nullified by BMEE. Activities of antioxidant enzymes were also assessed in all the experimental groups. These enzymes registered a decline in their activity in diabetic animals thus revealing the damaging effects of free radicals generated due to alloxan exposure but their activities were reverted towards near normal range in BMEE-administered mice thus indicating the antioxidant efficacy of the drug in resisting oxidative damage.",

      "abstract": "The possible protective effect of ethanolic extract of B. monosperma leaves (BMEE) on diabetes and diabetes-induced oxidative stress was evaluated in alloxan (ALXN)-induced diabetic male adult mice. Experimental animals were divided into three groups viz., I, II, and III. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced in groups II and III mice by a single intraperitoneal injection of alloxan (150 mg/kg body wt). Group I (control mice) received an equal volume of normal saline. Group III mice were further treated with BMEE (300 mg/kg body wt, p.o.) for a period of 45 days. Body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were measured at periodic intervals during the test period. At the end of treatment period, blood was collected by cardiac puncture under mild ether anesthesia and serum was isolated to analyze its lipid profile i.e. serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The homogenates of hepatic, pancreatic and renal tissues were also analyzed for both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), reduced glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total protein (TP). Alloxan injection resulted in a significantly (P < 0.05) increased concentration of FBG level. Besides, the levels of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants were decreased and TBARS level increased significantly (P < 0.05) in hepatic, pancreatic and renal tissues. Also, serum TC, TG, LDL and VLDL-cholesterol level elevated significantly (P < 0.05), whereas HDL-cholesterol reduced significantly (P < 0.05) in group II (alloxan-treated diabetic control). The FBG level decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after 45 days treatment of BMEE from 172 to 117.143 mg/dl, as compared to normal control (79.286 mg/dl). The activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT and GSH-Px) and GSH level in hepatic, pancreatic and renal tissues also increased significantly (P < 0.05) in BMEE-treated mice, but the activity of SOD was not improved significantly. BMEE treatment also reduced the TBARS levels and lowered serum lipid profile significantly (P < 0.05). The findings of the present study indicated significant hypoglycemic and anti-oxidant activity in B. monosperma leaves, thus lends credence to its folklore use in the management and/or control of type-2 DM.",

Treatment of male Wistar rats for five consecutive days with 2-AAF i.p. induced significant hepatic toxicity, oxidative stress and hyperproliferation. Pretreatment of B.monosperma extract (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) prevented oxidative stress by restoring the levels of antioxidant enzymes and also prevented toxicity at both doses. The promotion parameters induced (ornithine decarboxylase activity and DNA synthesis) by 2-AAF administration in diet with partial hepatectomy (PH) were also significantly suppressed dose dependently by B. monosperma. Thereafter, we proceeded with studies on rat liver carcinogenesis. After fourteen days of DEN treatment, dietary administration of 2-AAF with PH resulted in a 100% incidence of tumors in the animals. However, B.monosperma caused reduction in the number of tumors/ rat and percentage of tumor bearing rats at the end of the study, as confirmed histologically. Thus, our data suggest that B.monosperma extract is a potent chemopreventive agent which suppresses 2-AAF-induced hepatic carcinogenesis and oxidative damage in Wistar rats. The protective activity of the plant might be due to the two major constituents (butrin and isobutrin).",

The petroleum ether extract was fractionated by column chromatography using solvents of varying polarity such as n-hexane, n-hexane:ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and methanol. The anticonvulsive principle of B. monosperma was found to be a triterpene (TBM) present in the n-hexane:ethyl acetate (1:1) fraction of the petroleum ether extract. TBM exhibited anticonvulsant activity against seizures induced by maximum electroshock (MES) and its PD(50) was found to be 34.2+/-18.1 mg/kg. TBM also inhibited seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), electrical kindling, and the combination of lithium sulfate and pilocarpine nitrate (Li-Pilo). However, TBM was not effective against seizures induced by strychnine and picrotoxin. TBM exhibited depressant effect on the central nervous system. After repeated use for 7 days, the PD(50) (MES) of TBM increased to 51.5+/-12.1 mg/kg. Similarly, after repeated use of TBM, the duration of sleep induced by pentobarbital was not reduced significantly. Further studies are required to investigate its usefulness in the treatment of epilepsy.",

Effects of neuraminidase treatment on the reactivities of AFP to the lectins were also studied. The results indicated that BMA had the highest affinity for the exposed Gal residues of nonreducing termini of biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides, and that the affinity was reduced to zero in the following order by the presence of monosialyl residue of the Man alpha1->3 arm, monosialyl residue of the Man alpha1->6 arm, monosialyl residue of the Man alpha 1->3 arm and bisecting G1cNAc, and disialyl residues. BMA did not recognize Neu5Ac alpha2->6 and Neu5Ac alpha2->3 substitutions of Gal.
