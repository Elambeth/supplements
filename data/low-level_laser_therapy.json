      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) has gained attention as a non-invasive adjunctive treatment in oral surgery due to its potential to enhance tissue healing, reduce postoperative pain, and modulate inflammation. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of LLLT in improving postoperative wound healing, alleviating pain, and controlling inflammation in patients undergoing oral surgical procedures. It also aimed to identify optimal laser parameters for future clinical application. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed following PRISMA 2020 guidelines and the PROPS framework. Literature searches were conducted in five electronic databases and grey literature sources up to March 2025. Studies included adult patients undergoing oral surgery, treated with LLLT, and reporting outcomes related to healing, pain, inflammation, or complications. RESULTS: Eighteen RCTs comprising 771 patients were included. LLLT consistently demonstrated superior outcomes compared to placebo, sham, or standard care. All studies reported enhanced wound healing, particularly with wavelengths between 660-810 nm and energy densities of 3-12 J/cm². Postoperative pain was reduced by 30-55% within the first 3-7 days post-surgery, according to Visual Analog Scale scores. Studies that assessed inflammatory biomarkers showed reductions in TNF-α and IL-6, and increased VEGF expression. Additionally, several studies indicated a lower incidence of postoperative complications such as infection and delayed healing in LLLT-treated groups. CONCLUSION: LLLT appears to be a safe and effective adjunct in oral surgery. Further high-quality studies with standardized protocols and longer follow-up periods are needed to support its broader clinical implementation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been shown to exert biostimulatory effects, including increased cell proliferation and accelerated wound healing. Hence, the use of LLLT as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for improved periodontal treatment outcomes has been examined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effect of adjunctive LLLT in the treatment of periodontitis with a 980-nm diode laser. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a periodontal screening index of 3 or 4 who met the inclusion criteria were recruited and randomized into two groups for treatment allocation in a split-mouth design. The maxillary and mandibular left or right quadrants of the patients were assigned to either the test (SRP + LLLT) or the control (SRP) group. During the two final debridement sessions, LLLT was applied on one side of each study participant´s upper and lower jaws. The reevaluation of the clinical parameters and microbiological assays was performed 12 weeks after the initial therapy. RESULTS: Both groups presented significant reductions in clinical parameters (p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant differences between the test and control groups were found for any of the parameters (all p values were greater than 0.05). The recolonization of P. gingivalis and T. denticola was not significantly reduced in the laser group. CONCLUSION: The clinical parameters in both groups improved similarly after initial periodontal treatment. LLLT with the chosen settings did not show a beneficial effect during the initial nonsurgical treatment of periodontitis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: LLLT is under discussion for periodontal therapy as a promising treatment modality. Compared with nonsurgical therapy alone, adjunctive periodontal treatment with a diode laser did not improve the clinical parameters of periodontitis patients in this study. Currently, there is no recommended treatment protocol for adjunctive LLLT in periodontitis, which needs to be further investigated with other laser settings.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) are proposed adjunctive therapies to enhance healing after dental implant surgery. However, direct comparisons of their effects on peri-implant marginal bone preservation and soft tissue healing remain limited. This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of LIPUS and LLLT on peri-implant marginal bone preservation, soft tissue healing, pain levels, and oral health-related quality of life following dental implant placement. METHODS: This single-blind, randomized controlled trial included 63 patients undergoing maxillary or mandibular implant placement, randomly allocated to LIPUS (n = 21), LLLT (n = 21), or control (n = 21) groups. LIPUS was applied twice weekly for 4 weeks, while LLLT was administered in 4 sessions over 2 weeks post-implant. Marginal bone loss (MBL) and OHRQoL (OHIP-14) were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks. Soft tissue healing (Landry Healing Index) and pain (VAS) were evaluated at baseline, 7-, 14-, 21-, and 30-days post-implant. RESULTS: LIPUS significantly reduced marginal bone loss at 6 weeks and 3 months post-implant compared to LLLT and control groups (p < 0.05). LLLT demonstrated superior soft tissue healing at 7-, 14-, 21-, and 30-days post-implant (p < 0.05). Both interventions significantly decreased pain intensity and improved OHRQoL at various time points compared to the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: LIPUS and LLLT significantly enhance peri-implant marginal bone preservation, soft tissue healing, pain management, and OHRQoL in dental implant patients compared to standard care. LIPUS was more effective for peri-implant marginal bone preservation, while LLLT excelled in soft tissue healing.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the laser-assisted new attachment procedure (LANAP) and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on clinical, biochemical, and radiographic parameters when applied alongside scaling and root planing (SRP). METHODS: The study was designed as a randomized controlled, single-blind, parallel trial involving 68 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. The participants were divided into three groups: Group 1: SRP (control), Group 2: LANAP, and Group 3: LLLT. Clinical measurements, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples, and standard periapical radiographs were obtained pre-treatment and at one- and three-month follow-ups. In GCF, interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were analyzed. RESULTS: In moderate (4-6 mm) and deep pockets (≥ 7 mm), laser-treated groups showed a significant reduction in pocket depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) compared to the control group. However, there were no statistically significant differences in biochemical markers between the groups. Group 2 demonstrated significant bone filling compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: In deep pockets, laser-treated groups provide additional benefits to SRP. The application of LLLT positively affected recession (REC).

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on nipple trauma and pain during breastfeeding through a systematic review with a meta-analysis of selected studies. SOURCE OF THE DATA: A thorough search was conducted on March 22, 2022, using the databases PubMed, SciELO, LILACS, PEDro, CINAHL, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials, Web of Science, TRIP, DARE, and ProQuest. The search terms included various combinations of low-level laser therapy, nipple pain, nipple trauma, and breastfeeding. STUDIES SELECTION: Out of 107 articles identified, only three controlled and randomized clinical trials was included. The extracted data encompassed breast and trauma characteristics, treatment types, outcomes (pain and healing process), evaluation tools, LLLT usage, laser brand, and parameters. DATA COLLECTION: Data extraction was performed using RAYYAN for systematic reviews. The risk of bias in the studies was evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pain was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS). The included studies did not use validated tools for assessing physical conditions. All studies employed LLLT with a 660-nm wavelength, though there were variations in equipment power, energy dose, and application methods. The meta-analysis revealed an average difference of -0.60 points (95% CI: -1.52 to 0.31) in the VAS pain scores between the LLLT and control groups. No heterogeneity was observed among the studies (I2=0%), indicating no significant difference in pain relief between LLLT (red light) and control groups. CONCLUSION: LLLT may offer a promising option for managing breastfeeding-related complications, though further research is required.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Rehabilitation of edentulous jaws with implant-supported overdenture has achieved a comprehensive acclamation across the globe due to compromised retention and stability in conventional complete dentures. In dentistry, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has become a viable treatment option for lowering inflammation, easing pain, and speeding up wound healing. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of LLLT on alleviation of pain in patients with two implant-supported mandibular overdentures. STUDY SETTING AND DESIGN: This study was carried out in the Department of Prosthodontics at Index Institute of Dental Sciences, Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Completely edentulous patients willing for implant-supported mandibular overdenture and who gave consent, were enrolled. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ten implants were placed in five patients with completely edentulous mandibular arch willing for implant-supported mandibular overdenture. Individuals from the outpatient division of Department of Prosthodontics, Crown & Bridge, Index Institute of Dental Sciences, Indore were chosen as patients. Bilateral implants were inserted into the mandible at locations B and D. On the experimental side, low-level laser therapy (wavelength 810 nm) was administered immediately following implant insertion and on the third day. Over the course of 72 hours, pain after surgery was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) values, beginning at baseline. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis of the intergroup pain alleviation scores. RESULTS: The results showed that on intergroup comparison, the experimental side exhibited significantly reduced VAS pain scores relative to the control side (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: LLLT can be used as a promising adjuvant therapy to lower the degree and duration of pain after undergoing dental implant surgery.",

      "abstract": "Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) refers to how oral conditions impact an individual's social interactions and positive perception of their dental and facial appearance. OHRQoL is a crucial patient-reported outcome in dentistry and typically includes four key dimensions: Oral Function, orofacial pain, orofacial appearance, and Psychosocial impact. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) is a widely used tool for evaluating OHRQoL due to its strong psychometric properties. It focuses on how individuals perceive the repercussions of oral health issues. Complications arising from oral disorders and dental procedures can significantly disrupt a patient's daily routine, affecting aspects such as diet, sleep, physical activities, and work immediately following the intervention, thereby impacting their overall OHRQoL. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT), also known as \"photobiomodulation,\" has emerged as a promising adjunctive treatment option to reduce inflammation, expedite the healing process, and enhance patients' OHRQoL. LLLT influences various cellular functions, including adenosine triphosphate production, protein and prostaglandin synthesis, neurotransmitter release, cellular growth, differentiation, and phagocytosis. Considering the significance of how oral health issues and associated treatment complications affect patients' OHRQoL, this study aimed to review patient-centered outcome measures in the context of LLLT to evaluate its impact on the complications associated with conventional dental treatments and oral disorders and patients' OHRQoL."

The current study assessed the impact of LLLT (650 and 750 nm) on tendon repair in rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen 2-year-old male New Zealand White rabbits were divided into three groups: control, 650 nm laser and 750 nm laser therapy. After applying Achilles tendon-destructive surgery on their right legs, rabbits underwent LLLT, and tendon repair was assessed using histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) findings. All data were analysed using SPSS version 21, considering a significant level <0.05. RESULTS: The study's histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that LLLT at 650 and 750 nm significantly improved tendon healing compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The treated groups exhibited better organized tendon fibres with reduced discontinuity, collagen fibre waviness, and inflammatory response (p < 0.05). Both laser wavelengths showed similar results with no significant differences between them (p > 0.05), but both were notably better than the control group in reducing inflammation, enhancing fibre structure, and lowering levels of collagen type I (Col-I); collagen type III (Col-III); transformer growth factor beta (TGF-β); galectin-3 (galectin-3); VGF nerve growth factor inducible; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), indicating a more effective healing process with LLLT. CONCLUSION: Due to our findings, LLLT at 650 and 750 nm effectively reduced inflammation, improved structural integrity, and enhanced the organization of collagen fibres for Achilles tendon repair in rabbits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dental caries, the leading cause of dental pain and the most prevalent chronic childhood disease globally, significantly impacts children's oral health, with prevalence ranging from 16% to 92.2% in India. Untreated caries in deciduous teeth can lead to pain, dietary changes, sleep disturbances, and enamel defects in permanent teeth. Pediatric dentists manage infected pulp with pulp therapy or extraction. Postoperative complications, such as discomfort and bleeding, are common in extraction cases. AIM: This study aims to compare the analgesic and hemostatic efficacy of chitosan and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in pediatric extractions, hypothesizing no significant difference between the two. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This crossover randomized clinical trial was carried out within 87 primary molars from 29 participants. The study participants were randomized into three distinct groups, each with a specific order of interventions: Group A first received the control, followed by laser, and then chitosan; Group B first underwent the laser intervention, followed by chitosan, and finally the control; and Group C first experienced the chitosan intervention, followed by the control, and then laser. After extraction of the primary molar, properly shaped gauze piece, a 940-nm wavelength diode laser (diode Epic, BioLase, USA) was used in a continuous mode with 400 um diameter fiber tip at an approximately 8 mm away from the teeth socket without contact until 1 min, chitosan Sponge of 7 mm was measured using a periodontal probe and was placed into the extraction socket, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23 (IBM), with a significance level set at 5%. RESULTS: The mean pain score was least for the LLLT group, followed by the Chitosan group and the maximum mean pain score was recorded for the control group and this difference was statistically significant, whereas there was no significant difference regarding the postoperative bleeding after 15 min between three groups. Chitosan was the intervention of choice for both the children and their guardians. CONCLUSION: Soft-tissue diode lasers can be utilized for postoperative pain management subsequent to deciduous tooth extraction in children. This would reduce the reliance on analgesic medication and eliminate the possibility of adverse effects. Chitosan can serve as a highly effective, dependable, and cost-effective substitute in case of the diode laser's inaccessibility.",

METHODS: This double-blinded, parallel, randomized clinical trial included 30 participants who were randomly assigned to the laser group or the control group, with Little's irregularity index of 4-8 mm in the mandibular canine-canine region. Nickel-titanium archwires measuring 0.012 inches were tied with elastomeric ligatures and changed every 14 days throughout the leveling process. The leveling duration was recorded in days, from the bonding application to the end of leveling. Irradiation was performed at an 810-nm wavelength using a gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser device with a power output of 100 mW and an energy density of 8 J/cm². Laser applications were performed after archwire ligation (day 0), on days 3, 7, and 14 and every 14 days until leveling was completed. The leveling duration was calculated, and pain levels were evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) after archwire ligation (hour 0), at hours 2 and 6 and on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21. RESULTS: The leveling duration showed no significant differences between the laser and control groups (p=0.170). Group comparison results of the VAS scores at hour 6 (p=0.001) and day 1 (p=0.006) exhibited significantly reduced pain levels in the laser group compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Although LLLT is not effective in reducing the leveling duration, it significantly reduces pain levels at hour 6 and on the 1st day."

Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) may influence PRF properties through its stimulatory effects. AIM: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of LLLT on PRF architectural changes and platelet concentrate values. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four samples from seventeen subjects were included in the study, with 20 mL of blood collected from each participant. Blood was distributed into two 10 mL vacutainer tubes: one served as a control for baseline platelet and leukocyte counts, whereas the other was used for PRF preparation. The PRF samples were vertically cut into two equal parts and divided into two groups: Group I (without laser treatment) and Group II (treated with LLLT). Histological preparations were performed for all samples. The mean and standard deviation of platelet and leukocyte counts in Groups I and II were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.1. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc tests were employed for comparisons. RESULTS: Platelet and leukocyte values showed statistically significant differences, with greater cellular entrapment in Group II compared to Group I. The residual serum cell count in both groups was lower than the whole blood cell count. Microscopically, Group I displayed dense, thick fibrils with increased spacing distally, whereas Group II exhibited thinner fibrils with gradual density changes toward the distal end. CONCLUSION: PRF obtained in both groups was similar in size. Laser irradiation altered the fibrin architecture and enhanced platelet and leukocyte entrapment in PRF."

      "abstract": "As the global population ages, neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), have become a major public health concern. AD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for 60-80% of cases, and is characterized by progressive cognitive and memory decline due to neuronal loss. Current pharmacological treatments primarily offer symptomatic relief rather than a cure. Recent research has highlighted the role of vitamin D in neuroprotection, owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, as well as its ability to maintain blood-brain barrier integrity and regulate amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance. Another emerging noninvasive therapeutic approach is Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), a form of photobiomodulation (PBM) that has been shown to enhance neuronal function, reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and Aβ deposition, and potentially increase vitamin D levels. This review examines the interplay between LLLT, vitamin D, and oxidative stress in AD pathophysiology. Findings suggest that LLLT can stimulate mitochondrial function, enhance synaptic plasticity, and improve cognitive performance in preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, LLLT has been reported to modulate immune responses, promote neurogenesis, and facilitate vitamin D synthesis by activating cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial energy production. However, while promising, further in vivo and clinical trials are required to optimize treatment protocols and establish standardized guidelines for LLLT application, particularly in enhancing vitamin D levels, in AD patients.

      "abstract": "Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been shown to influence cellular and molecular processes in irradiated tissues and cells. By altering gene expression and activating specific laser-induced signaling pathways, LLLT can impact key cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and metabolism. This review focuses on exploring the molecular-level effects of LLLT, examining how different wavelengths interact with various cell lines, including stem cells, to induce these changes in gene expression and signaling pathways. A comprehensive review was performed by analyzing relevant literature published between 2003 and 2024. The search utilized databases such as PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Selection criteria were based on the presence of keywords including \"gene expression,\" \"signaling pathways,\" \"molecular mechanisms,\" \"photobiomodulation,\" and \"LLLT.\" Among the 150 recent studies on low-level laser therapy and its molecular and cellular effects on irradiated cells, articles related to changes in gene expression and laser-induced signaling pathways were reviewed. Low-level laser therapy exhibits varying effects based on the parameters and wavelengths used. Red and infrared lasers are particularly effective for promoting cell proliferation, differentiation, reducing inflammation, and enhancing wound healing. Blue lasers tend to inhibit cell proliferation, while green lasers are effective in reducing inflammation and aiding in conditions such as intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. These effects are linked to changes in gene expression and laser-induced signaling pathways, highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate laser type for specific therapeutic goals.",

Additionally, this review sought to identify the most effective laser parameters (wavelength, energy density, and duration of therapy) and compare LLLT outcomes with conventional treatment modalities. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases until December 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated LLLT's effects on pain (via Visual Analog Scale) and vertical aperture (VA) were included. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool. RESULTS: This systematic review analyzed 44 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with 1,816 participants, confirming that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) significantly reduces pain intensity (60-70 % decrease on the Visual Analog Scale) and improves mandibular function (10-20 % increase in maximum mouth opening). The most effective laser wavelengths ranged from 810 to 940 nm, with energy densities of 3-12 J/cm². Longer treatment durations (>4 weeks) provided more sustained benefits. Compared to occlusal splints, NSAIDs, and TENS, LLLT showed superior or comparable pain relief with fewer side effects. However, variability in laser parameters and protocols remains a limitation. CONCLUSION: LLLT is a safe and effective non-invasive treatment for TMD, offering substantial benefits in pain management and functional recovery. Standardized protocols based on optimized dosimetry are needed to enhance clinical outcomes further."

Despite the widespread use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and limited use of Tecar therapy in physiotherapy for diabetics, the synergistic effect of these two interventions in a long-term follow-up has not yet been determined. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the effects of Tecar therapy and LLLT separately and simultaneously over a 3-month follow-up period on clinical symptoms and health-related quality of life in individuals with type 2 diabetes and DPN. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, forty-five individuals with type 2 diabetes (30 women and 15 men) with DPN were randomly assigned to three groups of 15 people: Tecar-on + laser-sham, Tecar-on + laser-on, and laser-on + Tecar-sham. The patients received ten treatment sessions and were followed up for 3-months after the last session. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF Questionnaire, while clinical symptoms, including pain (measured with a Visual Analog Scale), functional balance (evaluated with the timed-up and go test), and neuropathy symptoms (assessed with the Michigan Questionnaire) were also recorded. RESULTS: Inter-group comparison after ten sessions revealed that the Tecar-on + laser-sham and Tecar-on + laser-on groups exhibited significant improvement in neuropathy symptoms compared to the laser-on + Tecar-sham group. Even after the 3-month follow-up, these two groups showed lasting improvement in all variables compared to the laser-on + Tecar-sham group (P < 0.05). The Tecar-on + laser-on group demonstrated a more enduring significant effect on pain scores (P = 0.035) compared to the Tecar-on + laser-sham group after the 3-month follow-up. In intra-group comparison, all three groups showed significant improvement in clinical symptoms and health-related quality of life after ten treatment sessions compared to before treatment (P < 0.05). Moreover, after the 3-month follow-up, both the Tecar-on + laser-sham group and the Tecar-on + laser-on group demonstrated a more lasting significant effect in all variables compared to before treatment (P < 0.05). For the laser-on + Tecar-sham group, a more durable improvement in health-related quality of life (P = 0.000) and neuropathy symptoms (P = 0.011) was reported after the 3-month follow-up compared to before treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although all three groups exhibited significant improvement in clinical symptoms and health-related quality of life in individuals with type 2 diabetes and DPN after ten treatment sessions, the synergistic use of Tecar therapy and LLLT after a long-term follow-up period could lead to more durable therapeutic effects in improving these outcomes for individuals with diabetes."

In a workshop conducted by WHO in 2005, the topic of discussion was \"Oral lesion with a predisposition to malignant transformation\"; thus, they proposed the term \"Potentially Malignant Disorders [OPMDs]\". Therefore, patients evaluated with OPMDs may have an inclined vulnerability to develop lesion anywhere in their mouth during their lifetime. There are various treatment modalities in treating OPMDs, among which the looming and imminent treatment modality is \"Laser therapy\" using \"Low level laser therapy [LLLT] and Ozone therapy\". AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluating the efficaciousness of LLLT and ozone therapy in treating OPMDs. METHODOLOGY: This systematic review was performed using PRISMA guidelines. Systematic search of the literature was done with specific MESH keywords. RESULTS: Based on the preformatted criteria, 12 articles were scrutinized and critically analyzed in the PICO format. Therefore, LLLT and ozone therapy have proven to be beneficial in treating premalignant lesions. CONCLUSION: Various treatment modalities exist in treating OPMDs; one of the less ventured and yet promising modalities is laser irradiation using LLLT and ozone therapy."

METHODS: Twenty-four male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Group 1 (the control group), Group 2 (the Sodium Alendronate group), Group 3 (the Sodium Alendronate and LLLT group), and Group 4 (the LLLT group). Mini implants were placed in right and left femur bones in all the four groups. Implants of groups 2 and 3 were coated in 1mg Carbapol gel incorporated with 1 mg Sodium alendronate. Groups 3 and 4 were exposed to LLLT (CO 2 laser, wavelength 830nm; 2.1J/cm 2) on 1 st, 7 th, 14 th and 21 st day. Animals were sacrificed on the 28th day, following which the femurs were dissected out and stored in 10% buffered formaldehyde for histopathological analysis. RESULTS: Groups 3 and 4 showed bony union and formation of reorganized spongiosa whereas Groups 1 and 2 showed fibrous union. The bone marrow from Group 3 had an adult-type fatty marrow, while that from Group 2 and 4 was occupied by red blood cells. Group 1 showed initial stages of bone healing in which the defect occupied more than half of the bone marrow. CONCLUSION: LLLT given using CO 2 laser therapy, together with a one-time application of Sodium Alendronate in Carbapol gel at the time of implant placement optimally enhances healing of peri-implant tissues.",

METHODS: Clinical isolates of M pachydermatis (n = 30) and a commercially available anamorph of M pachydermatis (ATCC strain 14522) were used in this study. Both groups of organisms were plated on potato agar plates and exposed to the LLLT device for 2, 4, 6, and 8 minutes with a 30-second break after every 2 minutes of exposure. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 hours. Each experiment was run in duplicate. The experiment for the internal control was repeated independently 6 times. Nonirradiated plates served as the viability control (positive control). The number of CFUs between each treatment and the control was analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA or a Friedman test followed by a post hoc analysis. RESULTS: Compared to the control, there was a statistically significant decline in CFUs after a minimum of 4 minutes of exposure to the LLLT device in both groups compared to unexposed controls. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary in vitro study demonstrated that the LLLT device tested can inhibit the growth of M pachydermatis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This in vitro study offers a novel proof-of-concept approach to treating Malassezia infections in veterinary medicine. Low-level laser (light) therapy has the potential to shorten treatment durations and reduce side effects, making it a promising alternative to standard antifungal therapy, particularly in the context of antifungal resistance."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 28 patients aged 18-45 years with bilaterally impacted mandibular third molars in similar positions, indicated for extraction based on clinical and radiographic examinations. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 received LLLT 10 min before surgery, while Group 2 (control group) underwent routine impacted tooth extraction after applying blue LED light. Measurements were taken preoperatively and at 24 h (T0), 48 h (T1), and 7 days (T2) postoperatively to assess the effects of LLLT on pain, swelling, and trismus. Statistical analysis was performed using the Jamovi 2.2.5 software. Due to the non-normal data distribution, the Friedman test was used for repeated measures within groups, while the Mann-Whitney U test was employed to compare the laser and control groups. RESULTS: The study included 23 female (82.14%) and 5 male (17.86%) patients, with a mean age of 21.34 ± 4.37 years. No statistically significant differences were observed between the laser and control groups concerning pain, trismus, and swelling at T0, T1, and T2 (p > 0.05).

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) covers a wide range of parameters in terms of laser properties and dosage, which is important for its effects. It is important to select safe, optimal irradiation conditions to obtain the desired therapeutic effect of LLLT on cells. This article is focused on the selection of favourable (biostimulating) exposure conditions for LLLT, which are the beam application method (continuous [C] or pulsed [P] laser beam), radiation power and LLLT dose, on the viability and secretory activity regarding resting macrophages of the RAW 264.7 cell line. Methods: RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded on 24-well tissue culture. ASTAR PhysioGo 400C apparatus with a spot applicator generating electromagnetic radiation in the infrared light range of 808 nm and power of 100 mW and 200 mW was used for laser irradiation of macrophages. Cells were treated with different doses of constant radiation 5 J/cm2/well or 10 J/cm2/well. Results: It was shown that the most beneficial radiation parameters for cells were obtained with a pulsed laser beam of 200 mW power and a dose of 5 J/cm2, which caused an increase in macrophage adhesion and viability, as well as an increase in NO secretion by macrophages and their TOS, with a simultaneous decrease in the secretion of TNF-α, MCP-1 and MMP-9 by cells. Conclusions: The research results presented above indicate that the effect of LLLT on resting macrophages modulates their biological activity, and the intensity of photobiostimulation depends on the irradiation parameters, including wavelength, power, dose and method of laser beam application."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically verify the available systematic reviews and meta-analyses of Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in diabetic foot ulcer (DFUs) to identify the effects and optimal parameters of LLLT in the management of DFUs. This umbrella review was written according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) report items and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Review (PROSPERO). The search for articles was performed in the Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase databases. The following terms were used: Diabetic Foot, Diabetic Neuropathies, Peripheral Vascular Diseases, Peripheral Neuropathy, Diabetic Foot Ulcer, LASER Therapy, Low-Level Light Therapy, LLLT, LASER Biostimulation, Low Intensity LASER Irradiation, Low Power LASER Irradiation, Low Intensity LASER Therapy, Low Power LASER Therapy. A search was performed in the references section of the included studies. The systematic review (SR) included studies that compared LLLT with non-therapeutic doses (parameters considered low to modify healing), sham irradiation, and conventional DFU treatment. The interventions were performed using red and infrared wavelengths. Although two studies included in the SR used wavelengths below 600 nm, these were combined with diodes with infrared wavelengths within the same device. Another study performed a comparative analysis of LLLT at different wavelengths (632 nm and 904 nm), with area reduction rates of 63.7% and 56.8%, respectively, with no statistically significant difference. This is study indicated that, compared with standard treatment and non-irradiation treatments, the use of photobiomodulation (PBM) with different parameters was effective in promoting UPD healing. Further studies are warranted to determine the ideal parameters for improving patient outcomes. (International Prospective Register of Systematic Review Registration number: CRD42022362447).",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The vocal folds are intrinsically associated with the thyroarytenoid muscle. During phonation, microlesions and inflammations can occur due to excessive voice use, which can hinder the correct vibration of the mucosa and alter the voice quality. In addition to vocal hygiene and exercises to reduce phonatory effort, resources such as low-level laser therapy (LLLT) are being used in clinical settings. LLLT has been reported to have a biomodulatory action that can reduce pain and edema in the larynx by accelerating the inflammatory process through temperature variation. This study aimed to evaluate the temperature before and after the application of single or multiple doses of red (RL) and infrared (IRL) in the laryngeal tissues of swine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive and comparative study was conducted at NuPMIA-FM/UnB and at Granja Miunça, located in the rural region of Brasília. The animals were randomly divided into 13 groups (n = 5) to evaluate the temperature of the larynx before and after LLLT treatment using photothermographic analysis. RESULTS: The study showed the thermoregulatory effect of the laser as an acute response to 1 and 8 doses of LLLT in the swine larynx. One dose of RL increased the temperature of the young animals (P = 0.0318); multiple doses of IRL increased the laryngeal temperature of the adult group by 2.1%, with differences between the applications (paired t test, P = 0.0208). In the combination of lasers (RL + IRL), the laryngeal temperature in the group of adult animals increased by 0.9%, between the minimum and maximum temperature before application, and between the minimum and maximum temperature after LLLT. There was a difference between the mean temperatures before (P = 0.0010) and after the combined (RL + IRL) (P = 0.0025). Also, the results showed that young animals with no LLLT treatment had 12% higher temperature (35.7 ± 1.7 ºC) than adult animals with no treatment (31.2 ± 1.9). INTERPRETATION: The results demonstrated that there is an increase and decrease in laryngeal temperature after different low-level laser therapy application protocols and at different doses. These findings could provide a clinical guide for the use of LLLT in humans."

      "abstract": "Introduction: This study aimed to compare the effects of high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on the disability and architecture of the quadriceps in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Ninety-eight patients with knee OA (KOA) were selected by convenience sampling and then divided into three groups: control, LLLT and HILT. Disability was determined using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Quadriceps structures including thickness, fascicle length and pennate angle of the vastus lateralis (VL) and thickness, volume and fiber angle of vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) muscles were assessed using ultrasonography. All evaluations were performed before interventions, immediately after interventions, and one month later. Between-group data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and paired-samples t-test. Results: The within-group comparisons of WOMAC scores before, after and at a one-month follow-up showed significant differences between the groups (P<0.001). The VMO thickness revealed significant increases after the treatment in both HILT (P<0.001) and LLLT (P=00.03) groups. The between-group comparison revealed a significantly lower score of WOMAC in the HILT group compared to the other groups after a one-month follow-up (P=00.03). VMO thickness showed a significant increase in the HILT group after the treatment (P=0.002). The VL structures and VMO fiber angle and volume did not exhibit significant changes in within-group and between-group comparisons (P>00.05). Conclusion: Both HILT and LLLT may improve functional ability and VMO thickness in patients with knee osteoarthritis. After a one-month follow-up, functional ability was greater in the HILT group."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in managing maxillofacial neuropathies, with a focus on pain reduction, neurological recovery, and tissue regeneration. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO databases was conducted for English-, Spanish-, and Portuguese-language publications on LLLT for maxillofacial neuropathies up to December 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with paresthesia, neuralgia, or facial paralysis treated with LLLT were included. Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were conducted by two independent reviewers, and results were synthesized qualitatively and quantitatively. RESULTS: From an initial pool of 841 studies, 18 RCTs involving 1,220 patients met the inclusion criteria. LLLT significantly reduced pain scores on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (mean reduction = -3.5, 95 % CI:4.2 to -2.8, P < 0.001) and facilitated a 45 % faster recovery of sensory thresholds compared to controls (P < 0.001). Tissue regeneration markers, including collagen deposition and epithelialization rates, improved, resulting in a 25 % reduction in healing times (P < 0.05). Mild adverse events, such as transient erythema, were reported in <5 % of cases. Variability in laser dosimetry and small sample sizes across studies were noted. CONCLUSION: Low-level laser therapy is an effective and safe modality for managing maxillofacial neuropathies, demonstrating significant benefits in pain reduction, nerve recovery, and tissue healing. Standardized protocols and multicenter trials are necessary to optimize its application.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An adjuvant treatment, known as low-level laser therapy (LLLT), has been suggested to quicken orthodontic tooth movement and perhaps shorten the course of treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 60 orthodontic patients aged between 15 and 25, a randomized controlled experiment was carried out (30 males and 30 females). Two groups, Group A (LLLT group, n = 30) and Group B (control group, n = 30), were randomly allocated to the participants. For the first 8 weeks of therapy, Group A got LLLT three times a week using a diode laser with a wavelength of 808 nm and a power output of 100 mW. The laser was delivered for 30 s on each side of the target tooth. Beyond routine orthodontic care, Group B did not get any extra care. Using computerized models, the rate of tooth movement was monitored every 2 weeks for a duration of 12 weeks. The degree of tooth movement was the main result; patient-reported discomfort and gingival health were the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The group that had LLLT (Group A) demonstrated a notably elevated frequency of tooth movement in contrast to the control group (Group B). Group A's average monthly tooth movement was 1.2 mm, whereas Group B's average monthly movement was 0.8 mm (P < 0.01). Furthermore, throughout the early phases of therapy, patients in the LLLT group reported less discomfort, and there were no significant variations in gingival health between the two groups. CONCLUSION: With its ability to speed orthodontic tooth movement, LLLT may shorten the course of therapy. Additionally, it seems to lessen pain while starting orthodontic therapy."

Photobiomodulation (PBM) has demonstrated positive regulatory effects on the imbalance of certain body functions, including pain, inflammation, immunity, wound healing, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Therefore, PBM at the intestinal level could help improve intestinal dysbiosis and reestablish cerebral homeostasis. In this context, this study aimed to conduct a narrative review of the literature on the effects of PBM at the intestinal level on intestinal dysbiosis and neuroinflammation. Overall, the findings highlight that PBM modulates the gut microbiota, suggesting it could serve as a therapy for neurological conditions affecting the gut-brain axis.

MATERIAL METHOD: 80 patients between the ages 18-50 years of either gender fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected for the randomized, prospective, single-blind clinical trial. Bilaterally symmetrical mandibular impacted third molars were selected for the study and randomly designated into two groups (Group 1- LLLT, Group 2- CRYOTHERAPY) each. Along with pain, trismus and swelling, POSSe (post-symptom severity scale) was used for assessment of postoperative discomfort throughout the 7 days. RESULTS: Pain and swelling scores were generally better in cryotherapy group when compared to LLLT Group, specifically in first 3 postoperative days. However, trismus in first 3 postoperative days was significantly less in LLLT group than in the cryotherapy group. Postoperative mouth opening exhibited a reduction of 3.60% in the laser group, where LLLT irradiation was done, whereas in the cryotherapy group, it was much larger, around 17.96%. On evaluating the POSSe, in LLLT group, mostly patients reported that they were affected in enjoyment of food, approximately 40% more than cryotherapy group. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of action and result outcomes for cryotherapy and LLLT has the potential to improve the quality of patient care provided by vast majority of clinicians in third molar surgery but when compared pain and swelling were better controlled with cryotherapy and trismus was better dealt with LLLT."

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Photobiomodulation in treating mucositis induced by chemoradiotherapy in cancer patients. METHODS: This randomized, single-blind clinical trial involved 36 patients with grade 3-4 oral mucositis. The test group (n = 18) received diode portable laser therapy (810 nm wavelength, 200 mW power, 6 J/cm2 energy density) for 4 days. The control group (n = 18) used a Diphenhydramine + Almgs mouthwash (50-50% mixture, 15 ml, every 6 h for 4 days). Lesions were assessed before treatment, one week after, and again at one month. RESULTS: Pain scores in the laser group decreased significantly over time (P < 0.05). Patients in the laser group reported better quality of life and reduced oral discomfort compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The severity of mucositis significantly decreased in the laser group within the first week (P < 0.05), though no significant difference was observed at one month (P = 0.158). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that Photobiomodulation is a more effective and efficient method for reducing pain, tingling, and improving quality of life in both the short and long term. It also reduces the severity of oral mucositis in the short term for patients with head and neck cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy.",

This study aimed to compare the short-term effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), low-level laser therapy (LLLT), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF) on pain, function, and quality of life in patients with knee OA. Methods: A hundred and twenty patients with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2-3 knee OA were randomized into four groups: ESWT (once a week for three sessions), LLLT (twice a week for eight sessions), PEMF (twice a week for eight sessions), and a control group with 30 patients in each group. All participants were instructed in a daily exercise program, including knee joint range of motion, stretching, and strengthening exercises (3 × 10 repetitions). Outcome measures, including the visual analog scale (VAS), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, were assessed at baseline after treatment and at the third month. Results: There were no significant differences between groups at baseline regarding VAS, WOMAC, SF-36, and TUG scores (p > 0.05). Significant improvements were observed in all parameters post-treatment for all groups (p < 0.001). However, the improvements in the PEMF group were significantly lower than in the ESWT and LLLT groups, particularly for VAS, WOMAC pain, and SF-36 physical function scores (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between ESWT and LLLT (p > 0.05). Conclusions: In the short-term, ESWT, LLLT, and PEMF effectively reduce pain, improve physical function, and enhance quality of life in patients with knee OA, though PEMF showed less pronounced improvements."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an aquatic progressive resistance exercise (APRE) and PBM (associated or not) on morphology of skeletal muscle and biochemical markers using an experimental model of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into 5 groups: control group (CG); OA control (OAC); OA submitted to APRE (OAE); OA submitted to PBM (OAL); OA submitted to APRE and PBM (OAEL). Trained rats performed a water-jumping program carrying a load equivalent to 50-80% of their body mass strapped to their chest. Laser irradiation (808 nm) was performed on 2 points of the knee joint. Treatments (3 days a week, for 8 weeks) started 4 weeks after the OA induction. The results showed that all OA groups presented a significantly increase in the muscle cross-section area (CSA) and a decrease in muscle fiber density compared to CG. Moreover, both trained groups presented a reduced expression of atrogin and an intense myoD immunoexpression in the laser exercised animals. The results demonstrate that APRE was effective in reducing muscle atrophy markers and its association with PBM could be effective in modulating molecules involved in muscle recovery in knee OA.",

Seventy-five stroke patients with shoulder pain were included in this prospective randomized controlled study. Participants were divided into three groups. All patients underwent a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program five days a week for four weeks for a total of twenty sessions with classical physical therapy exercises. In addition, Group 1 received LLLT for three days a week for four weeks. Group 2 received NMES for twenty minutes for five days a week for four weeks. Group 3 control group received classical physical therapy exercises. Brunnstrom (BRS) upper extremity, BRS Hand, Barthel index, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Fugl Meyer, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and visual analog scale (VAS) were assessed, prior to the treatment and at the end of four weeks. After treatment, statistically significant improvements were found in BRS upper extremity, BRS Hand, Barthel index, SPADI, Fugl Meyer and VAS in all three groups (all p < 0.005). When the groups were compared, significant improvements in Bartel, SPADI and VAS in the LLLT and NMES groups than the control group(all p < 0.005), however the LLLT and NMES groups were statistically similar. LLLT, NMES and conventional exercise therapy have demonstrated efficacy in treating HSP and improving upper extremity functions and disability. Laser and NMES were more effective while the effects of laser and NMES were similar.",

Here, we investigated the effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation on human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) in an in vitro experiment. METHODS: The hDPSCs were categorized into four groups: laser-irradiated with activators (VLT: activated vitamin D3, bone morphogenetic protein receptor inhibitor, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)) (LLLT(+)VLT), laser-irradiated without activators (LLLT(+)-only), non-irradiated with activators (LLLT(-)VLT), and non-irradiated without activators (control). Cell proliferation, hard tissue differentiation, TGF-β signaling pathway activity, mineralization induction, and gene expression levels were assessed using several approaches, including cell proliferation assays, ALP assays, western blotting, Alizarin Red S staining, X-ray diffraction, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Cell proliferation was similar between the LLLT(+)-only and control groups. The ALP activity was significantly higher in LLLT(+)VLT group than in LLLT(-)VLT group (p < 0.05); however, it was suppressed by TGF-β signaling inhibitors. Western blotting showed enhanced SMAD3 phosphorylation in the LLLT(+)VLT group. The mineralization nodules and mRNA levels of matrix vesicle marker genes were significantly higher in LLLT(+)VLT group, and the nodules were partially composed of hydroxyapatite. The hard tissue formation marker gene expression in LLLT(+)VLT group was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that in the LLLT(+)-only and control groups; however, it was unchanged or suppressed compared with that in LLLT(-)VLT group. CONCLUSIONS: LLLT using an Er:YAG laser, combined with VLT, may promote the differentiation of hDPSCs into hard tissue-forming cells and enhance mineralization.",

The rats were then randomly allocated to three groups (n = 10 per group). In Group 1, the excised nerve segment was utilized as an autograft and sutured at the defect site. In Group 2, a tubular construct containing stem cells and Type I collagen was used to bridge the proximal and distal ends of the nerve. Group 3 received the same intervention as group 2, supplemented with 5 weeks of LLLT. After 5 and 12 weeks, rats underwent histological, behavioral, and electrophysiological assessments. Data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Bonferroni post-hoc test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. At both 5 and 12 weeks, axonal count and nerve repair scores showed no significant differences among the three groups (P > 0.05). Notably, the Sciatic Functional Index (SFI) was the most favorable (lowest) in the autograft group, whereas the stem cell-only group exhibited the least favorable (highest) SFI at 5 weeks (P < 0.001). Additionally, distal latency was highest in the stem cell group and lowest in the stem cell combined with LLLT group at 5 weeks (P < 0.001). A significant difference was observed between the autograft and stem cell plus LLLT groups (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the application of stem cell-laden tubular constructs in conjunction with LLLT demonstrated efficacy for sciatic nerve repair in rats.",

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the effectiveness of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and combination therapy of LLLT and pharmacotherapy in the treatment of myofascial pain with or without other TMD (temporomandibular disorders). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with MPDS were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 received LLLT (BiolaseTM; GA-Al-As; 940 nm) in 12 sessions. Group 2 received a combination of LLLT with the drug Aceclofenac 200 mg till the end of the 12th session. Following each session and after two months, the pain intensity, maximum mouth opening, clicking sound and jaw deviation were evaluated in both groups. Data were collected and analysed using the independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test and Friedman test (a = 0.05). RESULTS: Both group 1 and group 2 showed a significant reduction in pain and a significant increase in mouth opening, which was faster in group 2 compared to group 1. CONCLUSION: Both LLLT and a combination of LLLT and drug therapy are effective in the management of myofascial pain. LLLT + pharmacotherapy combination is more efficient at improving pain and mouth opening."

The present study is randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled and aims to investigate the role of LLLT in the postoperative recovery of facial fractures. Patients with fractures of the zygomatic bone are selected and divided into two groups: low-level laser and red placebo light. The patients are evaluated for bite force, pain, mouth opening, and paresthesia in the pre-operatory day, on days 1, 2, 7, and 14. The trismus data demonstrated better results in the laser with a significant difference in the periods 7 and 14 days, with p-values of 0.0442 and 0.026, respectively. Regarding the bite force analyzed, no statistically significant differences were observed. In the pain scale comparison, there was a difference between the PLACEBO group and the LASER group for day 1 (p = 0.011), day 2 (p = 0.001), 7 (p = 0.001), and 14 days (p = 0.010). In the evaluation of paresthesia, on days 7 and 14, there were better results in the LASER group with p = 0.012 and p = 0.001. The laser acted as a moderator of the healing process, having a considerable effect on the aspects of trismus, pain, postoperative paresthesia, and bite force."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Spastic cerebral palsy (SCP) is a condition characterized by muscle stiffness and involuntary movements, which greatly affect movement abilities and overall well-being. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has emerged as a treatment option for managing spasticity, though the current evidence varies. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review seeks to assess the efficacy of LLLT on spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. We hope it will pinpoint areas where more research is needed and suggest directions for future studies. METHOD: A search of the literature was performed across databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Elicit. The search utilized keywords and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Only studies conducted in English that focused on children with cerebral palsy (CP) and explored the effects of LLLT on spasticity were considered. The quality of the selected studies was evaluated using assessment tools. RESULTS: The search identified 534 references, out of which eight studies met the screening criteria for inclusion. All cited papers indicated reductions in spasticity with further mention of reduced pain and greater muscle strength by some authors. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that LLLT shows promise in decreasing spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. Nevertheless, a lack of treatment parameters, heterogeneity in research methods, and a lack of objective outcome measures weaken the results. This review underscores the importance of standardized procedures and carefully planned randomized controlled trials to establish conclusive findings on the effectiveness of LLLT in this population."

METHODS: Fourty-five individuals with post-surgical or post-traumatic scars were randomly divided into three groups: Group A received four fractional Er:YAG laser sessions spaced four weeks apart along with eight sessions of intradermal PRP injections spaced two weeks apart; Group B received four fractional Er:YAG laser sessions spaced four weeks apart along with two sessions of light emitting diode (LED) weekly; and Group C received four fractional Er:YAG laser sessions spaced four weeks apart. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using clinical photographs, Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), patient satisfaction and histopathology. RESULTS: Regarding vascularity following treatment and the total VSS score, there were significant differences between the studied groups, with scoring was the lowest in Group A compared to Group B and C. Patient satisfaction was the highest in Group A compared to Group B and C. LIMITATIONS: A limitation of the current study is the short follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Scar revision therapy using combined fractional Er:YAG laser with either PRP or LLLT were found to be more efficient and superior to fractional Er:YAG laser alone."

Forty-two patients with SAIS were randomly assigned into three groups, the HILT group (n = 14), the LLLT group (n = 14), and control group (n = 14). All groups received an exercise program consisted of shoulder muscles stretching and strengthening exercises. Along with the exercise program, the HILT group received HILT at 810 nm /980 nm, and LLLT group received LLLT at 904 nm, three times weekly for three weeks. The primary outcome was the change in shoulder pain and disability measured by Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Secondary outcomes included shoulder ROM using a standard goniometer, PPT measured by pressure algometer, and sleep quality by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Measurements were taken both before and after a 3-week intervention to assess the outcomes. After 3-wk intervention, both the HILT and LLLT groups exhibited significant improvements in all parameters when compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, there were clinically significant differences between groups supported by a large ES favoring the HILT group for SPADI pain (ηp2 = 0.71), SPADI disability (ηp2 = 0.54), SPADI total (ηp2 = 0.82), PPT (ηp2 = 0.63), and PSQI (ηp2 = 0.42). The combination of HILT with exercises proved to be more beneficial in enhancing pain and function, PPT, and sleep quality compared to LLLT combined with exercises in treating patients with SAIS.",

The lower jaw specimens were collected and processed for histological, molecular, and histomorphometric assessments. The osteoporotic group exhibited alveolar bone resorption, accompanied by significantly upregulated RANKL and downregulated OPG mRNA expression. The short-term application of laser group showed alveolar bone partial improvement with slightly downregulated RANKL and slightly upregulated OPG levels. The long-term application of laser group showed dramatic positive changes in the alveolar bone, with markedly downregulated RANKL and upregulated OPG levels.

      "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE: Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic orofacial pain disorder that seriously affects quality of life of patients. In recent years, Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been regarded as an important innovation in pain management, but there is insufficient evidence of its effectiveness in patients with painful BMS. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of LLLT for immediate pain relief due to BMS. METHODS: This retrospective study included 94 BMS patients that were treated with an intraoral semiconductor laser (635 nm, 100 mW/cm2). Pain was self-assessed before and immediately after LLLT sessions using a 0-to-10 visual analogue scale (VAS). Paired-samples t-test and multivariable binary logistic regression were used to analyze overall efficacy and its influencing factors. RESULTS: After standardized LLLT session, 71.3% of patients reported an immediate pain decrease. Compared to pre-LLLT treatment, the VAS immediately post-LLLT was significantly reduced (P < 0.001). Mean post-LLLT VAS reduction was 2.2 ± 2.0, equivalent to 39.9% of the initial pain level. Meanwhile, low VAS before treatment, history of smoking or alcohol, xerostomia, and gingival lesions correlated with worse LLLT efficacy. There were no side effects or adverse reactions were noticed by the practitioner or reported by the patients. CONCLUSIONS: LLLT may provide non-pharmacological, non-invasive, side-effect-free, and rapid pain relief for painful BMS patients. No baseline characteristics affecting overall efficiency were found except for VAS before treatment, history of smoking or alcohol, xerostomia, and gingival lesions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diode laser is known for its biostimulatory effects on various cell populations such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts. The usage of low-level laser therapy for photobiomodulation depends on its type, emission wavelength, and energy selected. Previously performed in vitro studies have determined its effect on cell proliferation and cytotoxicity; however, the results were inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare diode laser effect on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) for proliferation and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 samples, 16 wells of MEF cells (Group I) and HGF cells (Group II) each with 8 subgroups containing control (no laser irradiation) and experimental (laser irradiated) groups were cultured after being seeded at 4000 cells/ well with 4cm inter-well distance. Experimental group cell cultures were irradiated with a single dose of 810 nm diode laser (energy 1J/cm2, 12.5 mW, 80 s/well) using continuous wave mode after 1 day of incubation. Spectrophotometric analysis was done after 24 h of laser irradiation for cell proliferation and cell cytotoxicity on the 2nd, 3rd, and 7th days on all groups. RESULTS: Human and mouse fibroblast groups showed positive results when irradiated with an 810 nm laser. A hundred percent proliferation was seen for MEF in 7 days and HGF in 2 days. Two percent cytotoxicity was seen on the 2nd and 3rd day in MEF. Increased cell proliferation and minimal cytotoxic effects were seen with diode laser usage. CONCLUSION: Low-level laser irradiation indicates an increase in cell proliferation with less cytotoxicity on mouse and human fibroblasts."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized control trial conducted between November 2021 and February 2022, 45 patients (30 females, 15 males; mean age: 65.7±7.6 years; range, 51 to 76 years) with type 2 diabetes and peripheral sensory neuropathy of the lower limbs were randomly divided into three groups: Tecar + sham laser (n=15), Tecar + laser (n=15), and laser + sham Tecar (n=15). Outcome measures for both right and left limbs included tibial motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), sural nerve amplitude, sole sensation, and ankle-brachial index (ABI) measured before and after 10 sessions and after a three-month follow-up. RESULTS: In intergroup comparison, the Tecar + laser group significantly improved compared to the laser + sham Tecar group in terms of tibial MNCV in both limbs after 10 sessions and all measured outcomes after three months (p<0.05). In addition, comparison between the Tecar + laser and Tecar + sham laser groups for tibial MNCV (p=0.021 for the right limb and p=0.002 for the left limb) and ABI (p=0.001 for the right limb and p=0.002 for the left limb) in both limbs after three months was significant. In the intragroup comparison, a significant improvement was found in the laser + sham Tecar group for sole sensation (p<0.001) and ABI (p<0.001) of both limbs after three months compared to before the interventions, whereas in the other two groups, significant improvements were found in all four outcomes. CONCLUSION: A significant increase was found in neurological outcomes in all three groups after 10 sessions. Moreover, the use of combined Tecar therapy and laser compared to Tecar or laser alone could lead to a more lasting effect in improving the sensory symptoms of type 2 diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy of the lower limbs."

RESEARCH PROTOCOL: This systematic review followed the recommendation of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline 2020. LITERATURE SEARCH: An electronic search of the databases was performed to find the effectiveness of LLLT over formocresol as a pulpotomy agent in primary molars in children aged between 3 and 10 years. DATA EXTRACTION: Authors independently extracted the data from the 14 included studies based on the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria comprised studies that compared the clinical and radiographical effectiveness of LLLT pulpotomy with formocresol pulpotomy in primary molars using randomized clinical trials (RCTs). QUALITY APPRAISAL: The risk of bias was assessed using a tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration for RCT studies. DATA ANALYSIS: The meta-analyses were performed using the fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by a Q test and quantified with I2 statistics. Radiological and clinical success among the teeth treated with either formocresol or LLLT was considered the main outcome. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS: The search resulted in 390 published studies. After the removal of duplicate studies and analysis of full-text articles, 14 studies were selected for systematic review. Overall, the results demonstrated a high risk of selection and performance bias. No statistically significant difference was found between LLLT and formocresol as pulpotomy agents when compared clinically and radiographically at 6-9 and 12-month follow-up periods. LLLT is a good alternative method to be used as a pulpotomy agent in cases of reversible pulpitis. KEY MESSAGE: Low-level laser therapy is an emerging and trending branch in dentistry because of its beneficial effects in various treatment approaches. It can be effectively used in the pulpotomy procedure due to its properties to reduce pulp inflammation, improve healing, and preserve dental pulp vitality.

      "abstract": "AIM: The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of low-level laser therapy and intralesional injection in oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study comprised of 52 grade II OSMF patients aged between 20 and 60 years. A pretreatment assessment was done for each patients. And 52 patients were divided into two groups (26 patients in each group). Group I received intralesional injections, and group II received low-level laser therapy (LLLT). The intralesional injection group received 0.5 mL 1500 I.U. Hyaluronidase with 2 mL dexamethasone biweekly for a month. The LLLT group underwent sessions of 0.1 watt laser only once for 3 cycles, each lasting 1 minute with 5-minute intervals. Evaluation of overall accessibility, burning sensation and mouth opening was done for both the treatment modalities on 0, 3rd, 7th and 15th day. All data were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: On comparison of burning sensation in intralesional Injection group, at baseline, the mean value was 4.00 ± 0.84 and it reduced to 1.19 ± 0.40 while in LLLT group from 4.15 ± 0.96 at baseline, it reduced to 2.65 ± 0.68 at the end of 15 days, respectively. On comparison of mouth opening in intralesional Injection group, at baseline, the mean value was 21.73 ± 1.56 and it increased to 32.53 ± 0.97 while in LLLT group from 22.70 ± 2.17 at baseline, it increased to 24.50 ± 1.31 at the end of 15 days, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference found between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The present study concluded that intralesional injections are more effective in treating grade II OSMF compared with LLLT. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Several different treatment options are available to treat OSMF, including medical approaches, surgical management, and physiotherapy. One of the important therapeutic modalities is intralesional injection therapy with corticosteroids as they reduce inflammation and immunosuppression while hyaluronidase increases tissue permeability.

METHODS: A total of 58 patients who underwent implant surgery were enrolled, with a total of 70 implants. They were randomly divided into the LLLT group and the control group. The LLLT group underwent LLLT with Nd:YAG (Fotona, 1064 nm) immediately after surgery and on the 2nd and 3rd day in the surgical area, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Pain assessment was performed in the first 3 days after surgery. The weight of peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), gingival index (GI), and the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on the 7th and 14th days after surgery were evaluated. RESULTS: On the first 3 days after surgery, the pain score of the LLLT group was significantly lower than that of the control group. On the 7th and 14th day after surgery, the PICF volume, mSBI, GI, and TNF-α levels of the LLLT group were lower than those of the control group. The VEGF levels in the LLLT group were significantly higher than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: LLLT can promote the healing of the soft tissue after implantation, effectively relieve postoperative pain, improve clinical indicators, reduce TNF-α, and increase the expression level of VEGF, which is worthy of clinical application.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-mastectomy lymphedema is a common complication following breast cancer surgery, characterized by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid, causing swelling, discomfort, and functional limitations in the affected arm. Traditional treatments for lymphedema include manual lymphatic drainage and compression garments, but their effectiveness is variable, and many patients do not achieve satisfactory outcomes. Emerging therapeutic modalities such as Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), Kinesio Taping, and Endermology offer potential non-invasive treatment alternatives. However, the relative efficacy of these approaches in reducing lymphedema, improving limb function, and enhancing quality of life in post-mastectomy patients remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the effects of low-level laser therapy, kinesio taping, and endermology on breast cancer patients post-mastectomy with lymphedema. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted based on PRISMA guidelines. Searches were carried out in databases using keywords. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select the studies to be included. The selected studies were critically appraised using Cochrane's critical appraisal tool. The chosen studies were extracted and analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Quantitative analysis was performed using both fixed-effects and random-effects approaches. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in this analysis. All studies were randomized trials with good quality based on critical appraisal. The analysis found a significantly greater reduction in arm volume in the combined intervention group (MD = 76.27; 95% CI = 33.84-118.69) and in each therapy group: low-level laser therapy (MD = 91.98; 95% CI = 41.99-141.97) and endermology (MD = 34.61; 95% CI = 20.81-48.41). However, there were no significant differences in the reduction of arm circumference or pain scale, either overall or for each therapy individually. CONCLUSION: Low-level laser therapy and endermology provide better outcomes for breast cancer patients with post-mastectomy lymphedema compared to conventional therapy.",

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed by searching the electronic databases. Eighteen randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. Six hundred seventy skin wounds were analysed in the study. The primary outcome measures were the percentage reduction in wound size and the rate of complete wound healing. The secondary outcome measures included the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and the perineal pain score in episiotomy wounds. The percentage reduction of wound size in the LLLT group was significantly greater than that in the control group (95% confidence interval, CI, 13.93-37.70; p < 0.0001). In addition, the rate of wound healing was significantly greater in the LLLT group (95% CI, 2.32-16.70; p = 0.0003). LLLT has been shown to reduce pain, with the VAS scores for pain being significantly lower in the LLLT group after treatment (95% CI, -2.52 to -0.19; p = 0.02). The authors present the first meta-analysis within the literature showing the effects of LLLT on wound healing and pain in skin wounds.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of low-level laser is a therapeutic resource that has been widely used in medicine in general, which has properties capable of modulating inflammatory effects such as pain, edema, and trismus resulting from oral surgeries for the extraction of impacted third molars. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of laser therapy at two different wave frequencies (660nm and 808nm) in patients undergoing impacted 3rd third lower molar extraction. For this, 30 patients were selected and randomly distributed into three groups with 10 individuals each (Control Group, 660nm Group, and 808nm Group). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Each participant, according to their experimental group, received irradiation before the start of each surgery and immediately after the surgical procedure. The data regarding edema, pain intensity, and trismus collected before the surgeries, immediately after, and after seven days were spreadsheeted and analyzed to determine the mean and standard deviation. After the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, differences between the experimental groups were determined using Multiple Analyses of Variance, considering a significance level of 5% (p<0.05). RESULTS: The results showed no statistically significant difference between the experimental groups in the analyzed items. Despite this, both groups irradiated with 660nm and 808nm frequencies experienced a reduction in the perception of postoperative pain, thus suggesting the benefit of using low-power laser therapy as an adjunct in the surgical treatment of impacted lower third molars. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the results showing no differences between the groups, using LLLT resulted in lower pain perception in the irradiated participants compared to those in the control group. This fact supports the use of LLLT as an adjuvant therapy in patients undergoing oral surgery procedures to remove impacted third molars.",

A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, yielding 3,111 articles. After eliminating duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 94 full-text articles were assessed, and 23 studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. Of these, 22 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Data were extracted and analyzed using a random-effects model, with pooled Mean Differences (MD) calculated for the primary outcomes. The meta-analysis revealed that LLLT did not significantly reduce pain compared to placebo (MD = 0.00, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.09], p = 0.97). However, LLLT significantly improved grip strength (MD = -12.38, 95% CI [-17.42, -7.34], p < 0.01) and reduced morning stiffness (MD = -0.84, 95% CI [-1.33, -0.36], p < 0.01), despite substantial heterogeneity in these outcomes. LLLT shows promise in improving grip strength and reducing morning stiffness in RA patients, though it does not significantly impact pain relief. These findings highlight the potential role of LLLT as an adjunctive treatment for RA, with further research needed to optimize treatment protocols and clarify underlying mechanisms."

      "abstract": "Wound healing is an intricate process involving biological alterations in cellular integrity. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) includes special features that speed up tissue regeneration and wound healing. The objective of this review is to examine the outcomes of photobiomodulation therapy in terms of healing. A search strategy was prepared using MeSH terms and Boolean operators. The initial search was limited to randomized controlled trials in the English language from January 2014 until January 2024. An electronic search of the National Library of Medicine (NLM catalog), Google Scholar, and Scopus was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The studies used LLLT of various wavelengths and parameters on oral wound healing. A total of 54 records were identified through database searching. In total, 14 studies were included according to the inclusion criteria. Ten studies examined the effects of LLLT in post-surgical hard and soft tissue healing in humans. Four animal studies observed the efficacy of photobiomodulation on the healing of bone tissue. All investigations found a substantial contrast between control and laser groups concerning wound epithelialization. When used as an adjunct or a substitute, LLLT has advantages in terms of pain and inflammation by boosting acetylcholine esterase synaptic activity, beta-endorphin synthesis, and serotonin production. By promoting the growth of osteoblasts and fibroblasts, LLLT can enhance the production of new bone at an early stage. Hence, further studies and meta-analyses are required for a better understanding of the mechanism and to confirm the efficacy with different parameters."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has gained traction in sports and exercise medicine as a non-invasive therapeutic for preconditioning the body, exertion recovery, repair and injury rehabilitation. LLLT is hypothesized to modulate cellular metabolism, tissue microenvironment(s) and to decrease inflammation while posing few adverse risks. This review critically examines the evidence-base for LLLT effectiveness focusing on immediate care settings and acute/subacute applications (<6 months post-injury). Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted, prioritizing systematic reviews, meta-analyses and their primary research papers. Results: Findings are relevant to trainers and athletes as they manage a wide range of issues from superficial abrasions to deeper tissue concerns. LLLT parameters in the research literature include wide ranges. For body surface structures, studies show that LLLT holds promise in accelerating wound healing. In sport performance studies, LLLT is typically delivered pre-exercise and reveals beneficial effects on exertion recovery, improvements in muscle strength, endurance and reduced fatigue. Evidence is less convincing for acute, deep tissue injury models, where most studies do not report significant benefits for functional outcomes over conventional therapeutic modalities. Conclusions: Variability in LLLT delivery parameters and findings across studies underscores a need for clear treatment guidelines for the profession. Technical properties of laser light delivery to the body also differ materially from LED devices. Sport physiotherapists, team physicians, trainers and athletes should understand limitations in the current evidence-base informing photobiomodulation use in high-performance sport settings and weigh potential benefits versus shortcomings of LLLT use in the mentioned therapeutic contexts."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This scoping review explored current trends and available evidence in Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in the treatment and prevention of osteoradionecrosis. METHODS: The search strategy was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and grey literature on January 15, 2024, without language or time restrictions. RESULTS: 19 studies were included. The application of LLLT protocols was 58 % for therapeutic use, 21 % for preventive use, and 21 % for a combination of both. Regarding the use of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), 41 % of the studies employed this technique, which utilized methylene blue as the photosensitizer. For treatments associated with photobiomodulation, 57 % reported pharmacological treatment, 29 % surgical treatment, 11 % prescribed chlorhexidine mouthwashes, and 4 % other therapies. In vivo studies used diode lasers emitting low incident power densities in the near-infrared wavelength (67 %) at 780 to 904 nm. In comparison, case reports also used diode lasers emitting low incident power densities in the red and near-infrared wavelength (64 %) at 660 to 904 nm. The continuous emission mode was utilized in 83 % of in vivo studies and 17 % of the case reports. None of the studies included in this review reported all laser parameters. CONCLUSIONS: In general, studies suggested that LLLT can be used for therapeutic and preventive applications in the management of osteoradionecrosis. However, clinical studies are case reports and the variability in laser parameters across the included studies poses challenges for establishing standardized treatment protocols. The lack of comprehensive data on laser parameters underscores the need for future research to focus on standardizing LLLT protocols and conducting well-designed, large-scale clinical trials. This approach will help to better evaluate the effectiveness of LLLT and potentially integrate it more reliably into clinical practice.",

This study investigated the impact of postoperative 660-nm LLLT on the radiographic crestal bone loss of fresh-socket dental implants. METHODS: Thirty patients referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for tooth extraction and placement of fresh-socket implants were selected and assigned to two groups: laser (intervention) and no-laser (control) groups. Immediately after tooth extraction, the implant was inserted into the tooth socket. 660-nm LLLT was immediately started after surgery and was repeated three times per week for two weeks. Bone quantification at the implant site was assessed using periapical intraoral radiographs and computerized software immediately after surgery and after six months. RESULTS: This study showed a statistically significant difference in mean bone resorption between the mesial and distal aspects of the two groups, with lower bone resorption in the laser group compared to the no-laser group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that LLLT can effectively reduce bone resorption in fresh-socket implant placement. This might indicate the positive effect of LLLT on bone resorption reduction."

METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, divided into different treatment groups. The single application group received LLLT before or after skin incision or SNL. The consecutive application group received LLLT for six consecutive days post-incision, three days pre-incision, or three consecutive days pre-SNL. The control group underwent skin incision or SNL without LLLT. The von Frey test was used to quantify the pain associated with mechanical allodynia. Pro-inflammatory cytokine level and alterations in nerve growth factor (NGF) expression were measured by using ELISA and immunohistochemistry, respectively in the skin, muscle of the paw, and spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH). RESULTS: In the incisional pain model, LLLT showed significant analgesic and preventive effect. LLLT ameliorated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia but LLLT had no preventive effect. LLLT decreased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression levels in the skin, muscle, and SCDH and reduced the optical density of skin and spinal cord NGF in the incisional pain model. CONCLUSIONS: LLLT alleviated incisional pain and neuropathic pain caused by SNL in rats, and reduced the levels of IL-1β and NGF in the peripheral tissue and SCDH in the incisional pain model. LLLT might be effective in patients with post-operative pain and peripheral neuropathic pain."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shortening retention time and minimizing relapse rates are ongoing challenges in orthodontics. This study investigated the effects of natural fulvic acids (FAs) and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on orthodontic retention in rats. METHODS: Seventy-two male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent mesial movement of the left maxillary first molar using a 50 g force via a nickel-titanium tension spring. After three weeks of movement, the rats entered the retention phase with retainer wires and were divided into four groups: Control (no intervention), FAs (80 mg/kg orally daily), LLLT (808 nm laser twice weekly), and FAs + LLLT (both treatments). Retainers were removed on days 7, 14, and 21 for a 3-day relapse assessment. Maxillary impressions were analyzed for relapse rates using 3Shape software, alongside histological and immunohistochemical evaluations of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression in periodontal tissues, with differences among groups analyzed using an ordinary two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The relapse rate decreased over time, particularly at 10, 17, and 24 days (p < 0.001). The FAs group did not significantly affect relapse rates compared to the control group (p = 0.084). In contrast, both the LLLT and FAs + LLLT groups significantly reduced relapse rate (p < 0.001), with no significant difference between these groups (p = 0.555). Histological examination revealed active osteoclasts on day 10, decreasing by days 17 and 24. The LLLT and FAs + LLLT groups showed less local cementum resorption and better periodontal fiber arrangement. All treatment groups significantly increased BMP-2 expression (P < 0.05) compared to controls. with LLLT and FAs + LLLT differing significantly from FAs (P < 0.001), though no difference was observed between LLLT and FAs + LLLT (P = 0.578). CONCLUSIONS: FAs did not significantly reduce relapse rate with retainers, while LLLT effectively reduced relapse rates, showing no additional benefit from combining FAs with LLLT. Both FAs and LLLT increased BMP-2 expression in PDL fibroblasts but with no synergistic effect.",

Provocative tests and electrophysiological examinations are helpful in the diagnosis of UNE. Low-level laser therapy is one of the conservative treatments of UNE however, limited results were reported on the effectiveness of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in the treatment of UNE. In our study, we aimed to the efficacy of LLLT in reducing symptoms and providing clinical and electrophysiological improvement in patients with UNE. This study with a randomized-sham controlled, and double-blind design included 68 patients aged 18-60 years who were diagnosed with UNE. LLLT was applied to the first group, and sham laser was applied to the second group. The VAS pain, paresthesia, and weakness scores, grip strength, and provocative test positivity were evaluated in clinical examination. The QuickDASH questionnaire was administered to assess functional status. Electrophysiologically, motor distal latency (MDL) differences, sensory distal latency (SDL), motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) were examined. Evaluations were performed before treatment and on the 15th day and at the third month after treatment. The LLLT group showed improvement in symptoms, clinical findings, motor NCV, and MDL at both post-treatment evaluations and sensory NCV on the post-treatment 15th day (p < 0.05). The comparison of post-treatment changes between the two groups revealed that the LLLT group had greater improvement in VAS day and night pain scores at both post-treatment evaluation times, QuickDASH scores at the third month, and sensory NCV on the 15th day (p < 0.05) compared to the SL group. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the post-treatment changes in VAS weakness scores, grip strength and electrophysiological findings (p > 0.05). It was observed that splinting alone was effective in UNE, but the addition of LLLT, one of the conservative treatment methods, enhanced treatment outcomes.",

METHODS: Six articles were included. The mean age of microsurgery studies was 41.5 years and that of LLLT studies was 31.5 with female predominance in all studies. The majority of the included studies have been based on both subjective and objective assessments for neurosensory, two investigating microsurgery and four investigating LLLT following a Six-month post-IAN and LN injury. RESULTS: Each modality demonstrated positive outcomes in both subjective and objective assessments of neurosensory function. Notably, LLLT exhibited efficacy even when employed beyond a six-month interval following the initial injury. Early intervention is generally recommended, particularly for microsurgical approaches. CONCLUSION: LLLT shows exciting promise as a minimally invasive approach for neurosensory rehabilitation even after six months of injury, while microsurgery studies revealed an improvement and the recommendation for early intervention post-nerve injury, the potential of LLLT and optimize its use for neurosensory rehabilitation, additional randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and blinding protocols are necessary."

We aimed to reveal the short-term effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on clinical and sonographic parameters in patients with symptomatic RCCT. METHOD: This prospective randomized controlled study analyzed 76 painful shoulders of 68 patients aged 18-75 years, with over 3 months of shoulder pain and where RCCT was confirmed sonographically. Patients in the LLLT group (received 5 LLLT sessions per week and home exercises for 5 days/week for 3 weeks) and the control group (received home exercises, 5 days/week for 3 weeks) were assessed clinically and sonographically just before and after treatment, recording pain intensity, range of motion (ROM), shoulder functional status, location (supraspinatus/infraspinatus, subscapularis), number and degree of calcification. Degree of calcification was determined with ultrasound and classified by the Bianchi-Martinoli classification. The LLLT was applied to the calcified areas marked under ultrasound guidance. RESULTS: Both groups showed statistically significant improvements in ROM, pain intensity, shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI) pain/disability/total, and degree of calcification after treatment. No significant change was achieved for calcification in the control group. Considering the change values, improvements in abduction, extension, pain intensity, SPADI pain/disability/total, calcification number, and calcification degree parameters were found to be statistically significantly better in the LLLT group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Adding LLLT to the home program in treatment of symptomatic RCCT outperformed the home program alone, reducing the number and severity of calcifications, improving pain and disability."

Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a useful way to reduce the orthodontic treatment duration and may have some effect on preventing and repairing OIIRR. However, the specific effects of LLLT on OIIRR remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our research aimed to evaluate the Dentin Sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) expression level and root resorption volume during treatment and retention to explore the role of LLLT in preventing and repairing OIIRR. METHODS: Thirty-seven 6-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were selected to establish an OIIRR model; the rats were divided into Group B (blank), Group F (force), Group F(LLLT) (force and LLLT), Group F+R (force and retention) and Group F+R(LLLT) (force, retention and LLLT). The root resorption volume of the distal buccal root and mesial root in the maxillary left first molar was calculated by micro-CT, and the DSPP expression level on the compression side of the periodontal ligament was analysed by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The resorption volume in Group F was greater than that in Group F(LLLT). For the mesial root, the volume in Group F was greater than that in Groups F+R and F+R(LLLT). For the distal buccal root, the volume in Groups F and F+R was greater than that in Group F+R(LLLT). The DSPP level in Group F(LLLT) was greater than that in Group F and there was no difference between Groups F+R and F+R(LLLT). CONCLUSIONS: LLLT has a certain preventive effect and a limited reparative effect on OIIRR in rats.",

Our study aimed to investigate the impact of LLLT on collagen type I synthesis, cell proliferation, and viability in human ligament fibroblasts derived from the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL). METHODS: Tissue samples were obtained from individuals undergoing arthroscopic ACL reconstruction surgery. Primary human fibroblasts were isolated, and immunohistochemical assays confirmed their characteristics. LLLT at 850 nm was administered in three groups: Low dose (1.0 J/cm²), High dose (5.0 J/cm²), and Control (0.0 J/cm²). Cell viability was calculated using a membrane integrity assay, proliferation was determined by automated counting, and collagen type I concentration in cell culture was measured using an immunoassay. RESULTS: Fibroblasts showed decreased viability after low and high doses of LLLT, increased proliferation at the low dose, and increased collagen synthesis at the high dose on day 10 for both sexes after treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that LLLT may improve the early ligament healing process by increasing cell proliferation at the low dose and enhancing collagen type I synthesis at the high dose in human ligament fibroblasts.",

The patient diagnosed with COVID-19 was admitted to the intensive care unit, on mechanical ventilation, and on a nasogastric tube diet that persisted due to oral lesions. Painful ulcerated lesions, clinically diagnosed as viral ulcer, were found on the tongue, palate, labial commissure, and oropharynx during the oral evaluation. An antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with methylene blue and red laser (high energy) was performed, followed by treatment with LLLT with red laser. Significant clinical improvement of the lesions was observed after seven sessions of LLLT, with the oral diet being reestablished. Oral mucosal lesions in patients with COVID-19 are usually symptomatic and with onset after systemic symptoms. LLLT has been used in the management of these lesions, with promising results."

However, there have remained uncertainties regarding the magnitude of their effects in reducing pain and improving function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Hence, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of available evidence in the literature to answer this query. Methods: A literature search was carried out in Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases without any language restrictions from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2023. We examined randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies that investigated the efficiency of HILT or LLLT plus knee osteoarthritis ET in pain and functional improvement of the knee. We performed a network meta-analysis and provided the standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) by pooling the continuous data on the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function score using a random-effects model. Results: In total, 11 eligible RCTs were included. Our analysis revealed significant improvements in the VAS pain and WOMAC function scores on weeks 4 and 8 after interventions in groups treated with LLLT+ET and HILT+ET compared with placebo+ET. Moreover, HILT+ET showed a greater reduction in the VAS pain score (SMD=-1.41; 95% CI: -2.05 to -0.76) and improvement in the WOMAC function score (SMD=-2.20; 95% CI: -3.21 to -1.19) than LLLT+ET in week 8. Conclusion: Based on our findings, both HILT+ET and LLLT+ET treatments effectively reduced pain and improved function, but HILT+ET showed a more significant improvement in both outcomes compared to LLLT+ET."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in orchialgia after varicocelectomy surgery. Methods: This study was performed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in which sixty patients with orchialgia after varicocelectomy were randomly divided into three groups of 20 as follows: (1) low-level laser group with red (650 nm, 50 mW), (2) low-level laser group with infrared (IR) (820 nm, 100 mW), and (3) laser placebo group. The treatment protocol consisted of 15 minutes, three times a week, for only 12 sessions. Then, the patients were evaluated for pain and sexual satisfaction during the 12-week follow-up. Results: The pain score in the two groups of low-level laser with red light and IR spectra showed a significant relief (P<0.05) 6 and 12 weeks after starting the treatment, In addition, a significant increase was observed in the level of sexual satisfaction in the red and infrared spectra LLLT groups (P<0.05). Conclusion: We concluded that the use of LLLT with red light (650 nm, 50 mW)/IR (820 nm, 100 mW) spectra with power of 6-25 J/cm2/day in 15 minutes, three times a week, for 12 sessions can significantly reduce pain and increase sexual satisfaction in these patients."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included CBCTs from the records of 12 adult patients who underwent upper first premolar extraction and canine retraction with orthodontic miniscrews for maximum anchorage. The miniscrews on one side received LLL, while the other side served as a control. The Low-Level Laser was applied to assess its effect on the displacement of the miniscrews. The used CBCTs have been taken at two-time points: immediately after miniscrew insertion (T0) and four months after the start of canine retraction (T1) with a total of 24 CBCTs. Miniscrew displacement was assessed by measuring head (HMS) and tail (TMS) displacement to the axial, coronal and mid-sagittal planes on the CBCT at the two time points. Miniscrews displacement (T1-T0) was compared between LLL side and control side. Comparisons were performed using paired samples t-test. The significance level was set at p-value < 0.05. The reproducibility of measurements was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: After four months of canine retraction, HMS and TMS from both laser and control sides showed significant three-dimensional displacement at p < 0.05. No significant difference in mean displacement in the vertical, sagittal, nor transverse planes between both sides was elicited. CONCLUSION: LLL application in the used protocol does not affect the amount of miniscrew displacement in any of the three planes of space. Miniscrew displacement was significant in both groups.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripheral Facial Palsy (PFP) is a facial paralysis with various etiologies, including idiopathic causes (Bell's palsy), infections, trauma, and genetic factors. Traditional treatments involve antiviral medications, corticosteroids, and physiotherapy. However, new therapies, such as Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), are emerging with promising results. METHODS: This case series reports on two patients with PFP treated with LLLT combined with Vitamin B1, B6, and B12 supplementation. The first case involved a 52-year-old female with PFP due to a viral infection. The second case was a 33-year-old male who developed PFP following a traumatic brain injury. Both patients received LLLT sessions every two weeks, targeting 10 points along the facial nerve pathway from the facial notch across the face. The laser device used was the Theraphy EC (DMC, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil), with each point receiving 4 Joules of energy applied perpendicular to the skin after cleaning the face with water and soap to remove lipids that could interfere. The administration of Vitamin B was done using NEUROBIONTA tablets (Vitamin B1 + Vitamin B6 + Vitamin B12; Procter & Gamble, Santiago, Chile) with one tablet taken daily for 30 days. RESULTS: After six to seven sessions, both patients showed significant improvement in facial muscle function and overall facial symmetry. In the first case, improvements were noted in muscle tonicity and facial movements, with the patient reporting reduced facial disfigurement. In the second case, notable recovery in facial mobility and symmetry was observed, with the patient experiencing decreased paresthesia and restored muscle functionality. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that LLLT, combined with Vitamin B1, B6, and B12 supplementation, may effectively improve facial muscle function and symmetry in PFP patients. The non-invasive nature and ease of application make LLLT a viable option for PFP treatment. Further studies with larger sample sizes and standardized protocols are necessary to confirm these results and establish LLLT as a standard treatment for PFP.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 20 blinded individuals divided in a randomized split-mouth fashion; the experimental group in one hemiarch and the control group in the other hemiarch. The experimental group received a total of 22.5 Joules (J) of LLLT divided into 5 points per implant immediately after surgery. The control group received a placebo treatment. At 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days, a blinded surveyor administered a pain questionnaire using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) combined with a Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) to assess pain onset after surgery, duration of the first pain episode, and pain evolution. Group data were analyzed with an ANOVA test for repeated measures and a paired t-test at defined time intervals. RESULTS: The experimental group showed a significant decrease in postoperative pain at 24 h and at 72 h for fully edentulous patients. There was a non-significant difference in the duration of the first pain episode. The mean pain levels decreased over time for both the experimental and control treatments, but only statistically significantly for the experimental group in the 24-72 h and 24 h to 7 days intervals. The same was true for the control group when comparing 24 and 72 h and between 24 h and 1 week. The time range between 72 h and 1 week showed no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, a single dose of 22.5 J LLLT per implant helps to decrease postoperative pain in dental implant surgery at 24 h for partially edentulous patients and at 24 and 72 h for fully edentulous patients.",

Methods: This study included a treated group, wherein 11 C. albicans isolates were obtained from the saliva of HNC patients undergoing radiotherapy at a dose exceeding 30 Gy. The control groups consisted of an untreated negative control and a positive control treated with nystatin. The treatment groups were subjected to LLLT in continuous mode for 50 seconds at a wavelength of 976 nm, 0.1 W at a dose of 5 J/cm2 for Laser 1 (L1) group and 0.2 W at a dose of 10 J/cm2 for Laser 2 (L2) group. The tests were conducted using C. albicans inoculum equivalent to a 0.5-McFarland suspension on 96-well plates. All test group inoculums were then cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA), and the colony count was assessed at 104 CFU/mL. Results: LLLT at 5 and 10 J/ cm2 reduced C. albicans colonies by 7.01% and 10.94%, respectively, but the reductions were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Nystatin eliminated all the colonies. Conclusion: LLLT shows potential for reducing C. albicans colonies in HNC patients undergoing radiotherapy. However, further studies with varied parameters and methods are necessary."

Our investigation endeavors to assess the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on pregnancy outcomes in individuals who have undergone a minimum of three unsuccessful embryo transfer cycles (ET). Methods: In our randomized single-blinded clinical trial, we enrolled thirty females with a medical history of RIF who were eligible for frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). Through a random allocation sequence, the participants were divided into two groups. The LLLT was performed one cycle before blastocyst transfer in 15 cases using a New Age BIOLASER device (New Age Co., Italy) with a 900-milliwatt power output and an 850-nm wavelength. The irradiation sessions were conducted transabdominal on the hypogastric area. The considered outcomes were biochemical pregnancy, identified by a positive blood pregnancy test, and clinical pregnancy, confirmed through visualization of the gestational sac using ultrasonography. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 34.17 years, and they had undergone three to seven previous embryo transfers. There was no significant difference in basic characteristics between the group undergoing laser treatment and the control group. However, the laser-treated group exhibited elevated rates of both biochemical and clinical pregnancies compared to the control group (46.7% vs. 33.3%; P==0.710 and 33.3% vs. 20.0%; P=0.682 respectively). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study represents the first single-blinded randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of LLLT pretreatment in individuals with RIF. The findings propose that LLLT may potentially enhance biochemical and clinical pregnancy rates among RIF patients."

Methods: The experimental groups of this study comprised a control group and different combinations of adjunctive FGF2 (50 ng/mL) and LLLT with an 808 nm diode laser in one (LLLT-1) or two sessions (LLLT-2) of irradiation. The proliferation and adhesion of cells were evaluated by using the methylthiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. All experiments were done in triplicates on the first, third, and fifth days after cell seeding. Two-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests were used to analyze the data of the MTT assay. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: One-day post-culture, only significant differences were found between the control group and the FGF2 (P=0.04) and FGF2+LLLT-2 application (P=0.04) groups. After three days post-cell culture, only a significantly higher proliferation rate was found in the control group than in the FGF2 group (P=0.01). After five days, the control group and LLLT-2 groups showed significantly higher amounts of proliferation compared to the other groups (P<0.05). DAPI staining qualitatively confirmed the results of the MTT assay. Conclusion: The LLLT can be applied to PDLSCs on the day of seeding without causing a notable decrease in their viability and adhesion. Conversely, the administration of FGF2 should be restricted on the seeding day and postponed to subsequent days as it may have adverse effects on their adhesion and proliferation."

Methods: This clinical trial was conducted on patients with buccal bone dehiscence requiring dental implants. A CTG was harvested from the palate and placed in the labial side by considering the 2 mm distance between the implant thread and bone. Autogenous bone was harvested from the tuberosity, mixed with the allograft, and implanted at the site. After sufficient torquing of the implant, a customized abutment was fabricated and placed. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups (n=5) of intervention and control. The patients in the intervention group received LLLT with a 940 nm gallium-aluminum-arsenide laser while those in the control group received placebo irradiation. The primary implant stability was measured before the delivery of customized abutment while the secondary implant stability was measured after 12 weeks by Osstell® and reported as the implant stability quotient (ISQ). Results: No significant difference was found in secondary ISQ between the laser and control groups (P>0.05). In the intervention group, a significant difference was found between the primary and secondary ISQ in the buccolingual dimension (P<0.05) but not in the mesiodistal dimension (P>0.05). The two groups had no significant difference in gingival thickness or vertical bone gain (P>0.05). All implants were successful with no complications. Conclusion: LLLT had a significant positive efficacy for the enhancement of secondary stability of implants in the buccolingual dimension. CTG showed optimal efficacy for the treatment of buccal bone dehiscence."

Methods: The study population consisted of 164 patients with chronic radicular pain caused by LDH. The remaining 75 patients were studied in three groups. TENS and hotpack were applied to the lower back region of all patients. In addition, group 1 (n=24), group 2 (n=25), and group 3 (n=26) received LLLT (4 J/cm2 for each point), TENS, and sham LLLT, respectively, on sciatic Valleix points five days a week, for three weeks (15 sessions). Outcomes were assessed at the beginning of the treatment, after completion of 3 weeks of treatment, and after three months (follow-up). Results: Post-treatment assessments indicated that all parameters investigated within the scope of the study improved in all three groups, except for the VAS leg pain (VASLP) score in group 3. Post-treatment VASLP and DN4 scores of group 1 were significantly superior to those of group 2 (P˂0.001). Follow-up assessments revealed an improvement only in the VASLP score and in group 1. The VASLP, DN-4, and ODI scores of groups 1 and 2 were significantly superior to those of group 3. There was no significant difference between the groups in the PSQI score and lumbar ROM value. Conclusion: Both LLLT and TENS were found to be effective in treating the sciatic nerve associated with lumbar disk herniation with radiculopathy. LLLT was found to be more effective than TENS in reducing leg and neuropathic pains. Follow-up assessments revealed that the only lasting effect of the treatments, which continued into the third month, was the improvement in leg pain."

      "abstract": "Background Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse tendon injury, affecting athletes in running and similar sports. Repetitive overload of the Achilles tendon is the primary cause of inflammation, collagen degeneration, and tendon thickening. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of combining low-level laser therapy (LLLT) with eccentric exercises in treating midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Methods This prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Sports Injury Centre, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, from 2019 to 2022. Sixty clinically diagnosed patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy, aged 18 to 60, were randomly assigned to two groups: Group A received eccentric exercises with LLLT, and Group B received eccentric exercises with placebo LLLT. The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score and the visual analog scale (VAS) score were used to measure treatment effectiveness at baseline and three, six, 12, and 24 weeks. Results The study included 60 participants, with no dropouts observed. The mean age was 33.9 ± 8.3 years in Group A and 33.40 ± 8.64 years in Group B, with no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.821). Both groups showed significant improvement in VISA-A and VAS scores over time (p < 0.001), but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups at any time point (p > 0.05). Conclusion Adding LLLT to eccentric exercises did not provide significant additional benefits compared to eccentric exercises alone in treating midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Practitioners should prioritize evidence-based interventions, such as eccentric exercises, as the primary treatment modality while considering alternative therapies for adjunctive purposes. Further research is needed to explore additional modalities or combination therapies that may enhance outcomes for patients with Achilles tendinopathy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common chronic inflammatory oral disease that negatively impacts the quality of life. Current therapies aim to reduce pain and healing process yet challenges such as rapid loss due to salivary flushing in topical drugs and adverse effects due to prolonged use of systemic medications require further notice. Low-level laser therapy is reported with immediate pain relief and faster healing thus preserving the potential for optimal treatment modalities. This review critically analyses and summarizes the effectiveness of LLLT in reducing pain scores and healing time of RAS. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Scopus using keywords of low-level laser therapy, photo-biomodulation therapy, and recurrent aphthous stomatitis. RCTs between 1967 to June 2022, presenting characteristics of the laser and reporting pain score and/or healing time of RAS after irradiation were included. Animal studies and recurrent aphthous ulcers with a history of systemic conditions were excluded. Studies were critically appraised using the RoB 2 tool. A meta-analysis was performed using inverse variance random effects. RESULTS: Fourteen trials with a total of 664 patients were included. Reduced pain was reported in 13 studies, while shortened healing time was presented in 4. The pooling of two studies after CO2 irradiation demonstrated faster healing time compared to placebo (MD - 3.72; 95% CI - 4.18, - 3.25). CONCLUSION: Pain score and healing time of RAS were reduced after irradiation with LLLT. RoB resulted in \"some concerns\" urging well-designed RCTs with larger samples to further assess each laser application for comparison. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42022355737.",

METHODS: In this randomized, exploratory study, participants were divided into the following four groups: control group (CG) with LLLT placebo, LLLT group 1 (LG1) at 10 J/cm2, LLLT group 2 (LG2) at 8 J/cm2, and LLLT group 3 (LG3) at 4 J/cm2. Participants received light therapy (or placebo) twice a week, for a total of 20 sessions. Researchers assessed participants' QoL using the Short-Form 36 questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixty-two participants were included in the analysis (CG = 18, LG1 = 14, LG2 = 17, LG3 = 13). The LG1 group showed a higher proportion of healing, whereas the CG group showed a lower proportion than the other groups. The LG1 group showed a relationship between physical limitations and blood glucose monitoring, pain and foot care, and general health status (GHS) and foot care. The GL2 group showed a relationship between physical limitations and blood glucose monitoring, vitality and foot care, and GHS and diet. CONCLUSIONS: Low-level laser therapy had a positive impact on QoL as assessed by the Short-Form 36 questionnaire (functional capacity, vitality, and pain domains), and there was a positive association between QoL and self-care in the LLLT groups (physical limitations, pain, GHS, and vitality domains).",

Therefore, the current study sought to explore the impact of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on osteoclast differentiation, functional gene expression, molecular signaling pathways, and orthodontic tooth movement in clinical settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The RAW 264.7 cell line served as the precursor for osteoclasts, and these cells underwent irradiation using a 808-nm LLLT. Osteoclast differentiation was assessed through tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Functional gene expression levels were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) while signaling molecules were examined through Western blot analysis. In the clinical study, 12 participants were enrolled. Their tooth movement was monitored using a TRIOS desktop scanner. Bone density measurements were conducted using Mimics software, which processed cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images exported in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. RESULTS: We found that LLLT effectively promoted receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-dependent osteoclast differentiation and the expression of osteoclast functional genes, including matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1(NFATc1), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K (CTSK) in RAW264.7 cells. Clinically, the cumulative tooth movement over 90 days was significantly higher in the laser group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our research demonstrates that LLLT not only significantly promotes osteoclast differentiation but is also a valuable adjunct in orthodontic therapy."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into 4 groups of 10 rats each. The groups laser (L), ozone (O), and control (C) received weekly intraperitoneal injections of zoledronic acid (0.06 mg/kg), while group sham (S) received saline solution for 4 weeks. After the 4th injection, all subjects underwent mandibular first molar extraction and adjunctive laser or ozone was applied according to the groups. All the rats were sacrificed at 4 postoperative weeks for comparative histomorphometric evaluation of bone healing in extraction sites. RESULTS: Laser and ozone groups demonstrated significantly higher bone formation compared to control group (p < 0.05), while no significant difference was found between laser and ozone groups (p = 1.00). Furthermore, the greatest bone formation was observed with the sham group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the current study support that adjunctive LLLT and ozone therapy following tooth extraction may help prevent MRONJ and improve bone healing in subjects under zoledronic acid therapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Since the introduction in 2003, great effort has been devoted to developing a certain management protocol for MRONJ. Several publications have appeared in recent years documenting promising results of adjunctive LLLT and ozone application in treatment of MRONJ. However, experimental data are limited on this regard and the present study, for the first time, aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of LLLT and ozone in prevention of MRONJ.",

One of the microvascular complications of DM is diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), which is associated with increased mortality from serious infections and decreased functional capacity of the patient due to amputation. Uncontrolled diabetes is a significant risk factor for poor wound healing. There is a need for alternative treatments that can promote wound healing in these patients. Several studies have shown the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on wound healing in patients with DFU. LLLT is a potential therapeutic approach in patients with DFU. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old male patient presented with a history of DM, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic foot. The patient had uncontrolled blood sugar levels, with an HbA1C of 9.3%. The patient received therapy in the form of wound care with normal saline, topical antibiotics, and LLLT, with a dose of 10 J/cm² with a frequency of therapy 3 times per week. After 12 weeks of therapy, there was improvement, characterized by wound tissue growth and no significant adverse effects during therapy. CONCLUSIONS LLLT can provide benefits in patients with DFU and uncontrolled diabetes. The wound showed improvement after 12 weeks of therapy, and there were no significant adverse effects during therapy. LLLT is a minimally invasive, easy-to-use, and inexpensive therapeutic option to induce wound healing in patients with DFU and uncontrolled diabetes.",

Extraoral application technique in cats provides more comfort compared to intraoral application. However, the efficacy of LLLT through buccal tissue is still controversial. This study aimed to investigate the penetration efficacy of LLLT using 830 nm continuous waves with various settings and different application techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four healthy cats were included in this study. The wavelength of LLLT was 830 nm with an output power of 200 mW through extraoral application, using fluences of 2 and 6 J/cm2 in continuous-wave mode. This study compared different distances (contact and non-contact) and three different transmission media (absent media, alcohol, and normal saline solution). Measurement of the laser power within the oral cavity is represented as the mean output power (MOP). RESULTS: Penetration efficacy was detectable for all fluences, distances, and transmission media, with an average buccal thickness of 2.68 mm. MOP did not differ between fluences of 2 and 6 J/cm2 (p = 0.19). In the absence of media, MOP was significantly higher compared with alcohol (p < 0.05) but was not significantly different from normal saline solution (p = 0.26). CONCLUSION: Extraoral application of LLLT demonstrated penetration efficacy through the buccal tissue with both contact and non-contact skin (<10 mm). This is a potential alternative treatment for oral diseases in clinical practice. However, there is a need for further study on the efficacy of treatment in clinical practice."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on en masse retraction of upper anterior teeth in adult women with bimaxillary dentoalveolar protrusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this two-arm parallel trial, 36 women with bimaxillary dentoalveolar protrusion were randomly divided into two equal groups. Eligibility criteria included class I Angle molar relationship, good general and oral health as well as no systemic disease or syndrome. Four temporary anchorage devices (TADs) were used in the upper and lower arches for anchorage purposes. A 0.019×0.025-inch stainless steel wire with crimped hooks just distal to the maxillary canines was inserted. Nickle titanium (NiTi) closed coil springs (200 g/side) were employed for en masse retraction following extraction of the first premolars. In the laser group (LG), retraction of the upper anterior teeth was done along with the application of LLLT on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 after extraction and then repeated biweekly until the end of retraction. Retraction was completed without LLLT application in the nonlaser group (NLG). Data concerning the rate of retraction as well as first molars and anterior positional changes were gained from digitized models and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken just before extraction and at the end of retraction. Treatment-associated pain and root resorption were evaluated using visual analogue scale (VAS) and CBCT scans, respectively. RESULTS: Four patients dropped out prior to follow-up. The duration of retraction was 10.125 ± 2.876 and 13.643 ± 3.455 months in the LG and NLG, respectively. The LG showed a statistically significant faster rate of en masse retraction (0.833 ± 0.371 mm/month) compared to the NLG (0.526 ± 0.268 mm/month; P ≤ 0.035). The observed root resorption was significantly less in the LG (P ≤ 0.05) with comparable pain scores in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Within the constraints of the parameters of the LLLT used in the current study and despite the statistically significant results on the rate of en masse retraction and the associated root resorption, LLLT did not demonstrate a clinically relevant effect that justifies its use to enhance en masse retraction.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin aging and photoaging is a process that may appear at a relatively early age, causing an aesthetic problem. Common signs of skin aging include wrinkles, dyspigmentation, and decreased elasticity. AIM: Aim of this article is to study the effectiveness and safety of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) for skin rejuvenation. METHODS: Thirty Syrian female patients aged 25-50 participated in this study and were diagnosed with moderate to severe melasma and wrinkles. The patients were divided into two groups and received LLLT with a wavelength of 660 nm emitting a continuous wave. The power density and dose used were 15.6 mW/cm2, and 3 J/cm2 respectively, and the laser effective area was 32 cm2. The evaluation was done before, during, and after 12 treatment sessions, based on photographs, in addition to the modified Melasma Area Severity Index (MASI), Pinch test, and Fitzpatrick's classification of facial wrinkling at baseline. RESULTS: Comparing before, and after treatment, and between the two groups, revealed a significant improvement in skin rejuvenation, with a statistical significance (p < 0.05). Additional outcome measures included assessments of patient satisfaction scores, and no adverse effects or re-pigmentation were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that LLLT may be a useful and safe therapeutic option in treating melasma, skin elasticity, and wrinkle improvement, which we advised to be integrated into treatment, and follow-up programs in cosmetics and dermatology.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis with serious clinical consequences in which the use of antifungal drugs requires long-term treatment. Therefore, we studied the effect of low-level LASER therapy (LLLT) to evaluate its prospects as a complementary treatment for PCM and improve the clinical response to the disease. OBJECTIVES: Our study focused on the resolution of lesions caused by fungal infection using a subcutaneous air pouch model of infection. METHODS: We evaluated cell profile and cytokines, fungi viability, and the presence of fibroblasts and fibrocytes at the site of infection. Inoculation of P. brasiliensis (Pb) was performed using a subcutaneous air pouch model and the LLLT irradiation was performed on alternate days on the rear paws of mice for 10 days, after which the cells from the air pouch were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In animals irradiated with LLLT, the influx of cells to the air pouch was reduced, but they were more activated and produced pro-inflammatory (IL-12, IL-17 and TNF-α) and neutrophil (PMN) activating cytokines (IL-8, GM-CSF and γ-IFN). A better resolution of the infection, evidenced by the reduction in the number of viable fungi with preserved morphology in the air pouch, and an increase in the number of fibrocytes, indicating a healing profile were also observed. CONCLUSION: LLLT decreased the influx of PMN, but those presents were highly activated, with increased fungicidal activity. LLLT irradiation also resulted in earlier cicatrization at the site of infection, leading to a better outcome of the infection. These data are favorable to the use of LLLT as a complementary therapy in PCM.",

Journal of Oral Rehabilitation, 50: 1185-1193. https://doi.org/10.1111/joor.13555 The above article, published online on 05 July 2023 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted by agreement between the journal Editor in Chief, Peter Svensson, and John Wiley and Sons Ltd. The retraction has been agreed following concerns raised by a third party about the ethical approval for the study described. The publisher contacted the authors, who provided a letter of ethical approval from People's College of Dental Sciences & Research Center, People's University, which did not match the ethical approval reported in the article. The authors reported that the study was initiated at Banaras Hindu University, but were not able to provide evidence of ethical approval from this institution. In addition, the authors did not provide an explanation for why the clinical trial was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India retrospectively, which violates the journal's author guidelines that require authors to provide an explanation for retrospective registration of clinical trials. Following the investigation by the publisher, the journal has concluded this article did not follow the journal's requirements regarding ethical approval of clinical trials and registration of clinical trials, and so the journal must issue a retraction. Shivakumar, G. C. has stated that Marrapodi, M. M., Herford, A. S., Cicciù, M., and Minervini, G. were not involved in the investigation, data curation, conceptualization, methodology, or formal analysis of the clinical study. The authors disagree with this retraction."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 2021 and July 2021, a total of 60 patients with SAIS (19 males, 41 females; mean age: 51.3±10.4 years; range, 30 to 70 years) were included. The patients were randomly allocated to an LLLT group (LG), an US therapy group (UG), and a control group (CG). The LLLT and US therapy programs were applied five times a week, for a total of 15 sessions. Home-based exercise programs and cold-pack therapy were administered to patients in each group. The patients were evaluated at baseline and one and three months of follow-up using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain during activity, at rest, and at night, and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). RESULTS: All groups showed a significant improvement in the VAS and SPADI scores after the first month (p<0.05). The VAS activity pain score (p=0.008), SPADI pain score (p=0.003), SPADI disability score (p=0.012), and SPADI total score (p=0.003) significantly decreased in the LG compared to the CG at one month of follow-up. However, there were no significant differences in the outcome measures among the three groups at three months (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The LLLT combined with HBE is more effective than HBE program alone for relieving activity pain and improving shoulder functions in the short term. However, LLLT and US therapy do not provide additional effects in terms of pain and disability at three months."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) can improve the quality of life in women with Lichen sclerosus (LS) and insufficient topical treatment. METHODS: In a descriptive prospective observational study conducted between 02.01.2016 and 08.01.2018, we included 100 women with LS with insufficient topical treatment because of poor response of symptoms. All participants received ten LLLT treatments (808 nm and 500 mW) over a period of 8 weeks. The first four treatments were planned as two treatments per week. The remaining six treatments were planned as once a week. A Danish health-related quality of life tool (HRQoL test) monitored the effect. RESULTS: A total of 94 patients completed the study, median age of 62 [InterQuartile Range 53-69]. There was a statistically significant improvement in seven of the eight domains of the HRQoL test after ten LLLT. We found the results of DoloTest to be statistically significant in all of the groups except for smoking (p < 0.094). CONCLUSIONS: LLLT treatment can improve the quality of life in women with LS.",

The current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLLT on patients with OA of the first carpometacarpal joint (CMC1) of the thumb. Methods An open-level, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, for one year. Initially, 120 patients were approached for the study. Among them, 112 eligible patients were randomly divided into two groups: the intervention group received LLLT in addition to conservative treatment, while the control group received conservative treatment alone for four weeks. Pain and functional capability (motor) improvement were assessed on a weekly follow-up basis by using various parameters such as the visual analogue scale (VAS), Ritchie articular index (tenderness scale), grip strength, key pinch strength, Dreiser functional index, and CMC1 palmer abduction. Eventually, 90 patients completed the follow-ups and were included in the analysis. Results The majority of patients diagnosed with CMC1 joint OA were in their fifties. At baseline, patients of both intervention and control groups were indifferent in terms of demography, pain intensity, motor responses, and duration of suffering. After four weeks of treatment, results indicated an overall improvement in both groups. However, the reduction of pain and increase in functional capability were not found statistically significant (p-value: ≥0.5). Conclusion LLLT with conventional treatment was not found significantly more effective enough than conventional treatment alone, but more well-designed clinical trials with larger sample sizes are needed to reach a definitive conclusion."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is one of the fastest-growing health challenges of the twenty-first century with multifactorial impact including high rates of morbidity and mortality as well as increased healthcare costs. It is associated with musculoskeletal complications, with frozen shoulder being commonly reported. While low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and muscle energy technique (MET) are commonly used to manage  this condition, there remains a lack of agreement on the most effective approach, with limited research available on their comparative efficacy. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of LLLT versus MET among diabetic patients with frozen shoulder. METHODS: This is a single-centre, prospective, single-blind, randomised controlled trial with three parallel groups to be conducted at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria. Sixty diabetic patients with frozen shoulder will be randomly assigned into LLLT group, MET group, or control group in a 1:1:1 ratio. All the groups will receive treatment three times weekly for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be shoulder function and the secondary outcomes will include pain intensity, shoulder ROM, interleukin-6 (IL-6), depression, anxiety, and quality of life (QoL). All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, at post 8-week intervention, and at 3 months follow-up. DISCUSSION: This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of LLLT versus MET on both clinical and psychological parameters among diabetic patients with frozen shoulder. The findings of the study may provide evidence on the efficacy of these interventions and most likely, the optimal treatment approach for frozen shoulder related to diabetes, which may guide clinical practice.
