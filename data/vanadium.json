      "abstract": "Carbon-based electrodes are the most commonly used electrode materials for vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). Due to the use of aqueous electrolytes in VRFBs, the first challenge is the hydrophobicity properties of carbon-based electrodes, and the second challenge is that the desired redox reaction on the positive side, VO2+/VO2 +, competes with the oxygen evolution reaction. Therefore, a proper surface treatment is needed. In the present work, three different brands of carbon papers (Sigracet 28AA, Toray 060, and Freudenberg H23) were treated with heat treatment and an MXene coating. For the latter, a two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum titanium carbide (Mo2TiC2T x ) was chosen and the drop-casting method was used for coating on carbon papers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed MXene distribution and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed the presence of Mo and Ti on the electrode surface. Cyclic voltammetry tests revealed that the vanadium reaction rate, 7.76 × 10-4 cm s-1, and diffusion coefficient, 5.51 × 10-5 cm2 s-1, using Mo2TiC2T x MXene-coated carbon papers are comparable with when heat-treated carbon paper, 1.41 × 10-3 cm s-1 and 1.32 × 10-4 cm2 s-1, is used. VRFB tests were conducted over 150 cycles. Although a higher resistance of 1.2 Ω cm2 was observed for VRFB using Mo2TiC2T x MXene-coated carbon papers versus heat-treated, 0.8 Ω cm2, the energy efficiency of 71% was reasonably comparable to 79% for the system using heat-treated electrodes. More importantly, the same discharge capacity retention of 75% was achieved for both systems. The chemical stability of the Mo2TiC2T x MXene coating was confirmed by XPS post-analysis of electrodes where similar peaks for the freshly coated electrodes were observed. This work further broadens the potential applications of MXene coating as a treatment for carbon electrodes."

      "abstract": "The regulation of glial cell activation is a critical step for the treatment or prevention of neuroinflammation-based brain diseases. However, the development of therapeutic drugs that pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and inhibit the glia cell activation remains a significant challenge. Herein, an ultrasmall 2D vanadium carbide quantum dots (V2C QDs) that are capable of crossing the BBB are prepared, and the admirable anti-neuroinflammatory effects are presented. The prepared 2D V2C QDs with an average size of 2.54 nm show good hydrophilicity, physiological stability, and effective BBB-crossing ability. The biological effect of V2C QDs on inflammatory reactions demonstrates fascinating results in preventing the impairment of learning and memory in BALB/c mice stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. Investigation of molecular mechanism reveals that V2C QDs not only inhibit the toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation factor 88-mediated nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, but also prevent eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α/activating transcription factor 4/C/EBP homologous protein-signaling pathway and reduce oxidative stress via activating the NF-E2-related factor-2/heme oxygenase-1-signaling pathway, leading to greatly inhibited activation of microglia and astrocytes and weakened production of inflammatory cytokines. In summary, V2C QDs exert potent anti-inflammatory effects through multiple pathways, thus offer great potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

      "abstract": "Organic-inorganic nanocomposites (RF/VOX) were prepared by sol-gel method coupled with pyrolysis treatment using a resorcinol-formaldehyde carbon matrix enriched with vanadium nanoparticles. The structural properties of the final product were characterised using X-ray diffraction, revealing the transformation of the incorporated vanadium oxide from the V2O5 phase to V2O3 due to the pyrolysis temperature in a reductive atmosphere, alongside the formation of vanadium carbide (V8C7) in the sample treated at 1000 °C. The X-ray analysis also indicated the presence of a graphite phase across all samples. Microscopic examinations showed macroporous carbon structures enriched with vanadium oxide in the form of nanowires. These structural features significantly influenced the materials' electrical properties. At low frequencies, the AC conductance indicated a thermally activated process in the RF/VOX-625 and RF/VOX-650 samples pyrolysed y at 625 °C and 650 °C, respectively. RF/VOX-625 displayed semiconductor behaviour at high frequencies, while RF/VOX-650 transited from semiconductor behaviour to metal one at 200 K. The changes in the exponent s suggested that the CBH model effectively describes the AC conduction mechanism. Impedance analysis highlighted a relaxation phenomenon, and Nyquist plots illustrated the contribution of grain and grain boundaries in RF/VOX-625 and RF/VOX-650 at low temperatures. Furthermore, these plots indicated that in RF/VOX-650, the grain effect became predominant beyond 200 K. Incorporating vanadium oxide nanoparticles into the polymer matrix resulted in distinct physical properties and behaviours compared to the original organic matrix, allowing this material to be tested in various applications including negatronic devices and electronic components."

      "abstract": "Cancer research has gradually shifted its focus from individual therapies to a combination of them for enhanced treatment effectiveness. In particular, the increased interest in the field of catalytic medicine through nanozymes proposes promising combinations with photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH). Nanozyme activity centers around the hydroxyl radical ˙OH, the most toxic of the reactive oxygen species (ROS). With a synergistic approach in mind, we studied VxFe3-xO4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as agents for ROS production and heating. These MNPs were exhaustively characterised both morphologically and magnetically. A compositional analysis through electron microscopy and spectroscopy unveils a core-shell structure with a V-rich shell. A study of the power absorption of these MNPs fixed into a gel matrix, emulating cytosol viscosity, provides values of up to 1000 W g-1 for samples with 0.5 wt% MNPs, an AC magnetic field amplitude of 65 mT and a frequency of 350 kHz, typical in the MFH application. A concentration of the ˙OH-adduct of up to 2300 nM has been measured through electron spin resonance analysis as a result of peroxidase-like activity. Through the comparison with similarly-sized ferrite MNPs, we determined that V incorporation lowers the magnetic anisotropy and serves as an electron buffer, explaining the enhanced MFH and ROS-production results.",

      "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury following skin flap transplantation is a critical factor leading to flap necrosis and transplant failure. Antagonizing inflammatory responses and oxidative stress are regarded as crucial targets for mitigating reperfusion injury and enhancing flap survival. In this study, caffeic acid-vanadium metal polyphenol nanoparticles (CA-V NPs) were prepared for the treatment of skin flap ischemia and reperfusion. This study was conducted using a one-step method to prepare new types of CA-V NPs with uniform sizes and stable structures. In vitro, the CA-V NPs exhibited CAT-like and SOD-like activities and could effectively scavenge ROS, generate oxygen, and alleviate oxidative stress. In the H2O2-induced cellular oxidative stress model, CA-V NPs effectively reduced ROS levels and inhibited apoptosis through the XIAP/Caspase-3 pathway. In the cellular inflammation model induced by LPS combined with IFN-γ, CA-V NPs reprogrammed macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype and reduced inflammatory responses by reducing the expression of the chemokines CCL4 and CXCL2. In addition, animal experiments have shown that CA-V NPs can alleviate oxidative stress in skin flap tissues, inhibit apoptosis, promote angiogenesis, and ultimately improve the survival rate of skin flaps. CA-V NPs provide a new target and strategy for the treatment of flap I/R injury."

      "abstract": "Manganese oxide (MnOx) was studied for its ability to adsorb vanadium (V) ions for applications in acidic water treatment. Three MnOx types: naturally-occurring (NatMnO), commercially-derived (ComMnO), and laboratory synthesised (SynMnO) were examined in batch systems under varying pH, adsorbent dosage, ionic strength, and contact time. The greatest V sorption occurred at acidic pH, following the order: NatMnO > SynMnO > ComMnO, with maximum adsorption capacities of 54.0, 26.0, and 10.4 mg/g, respectively (at pH 3.0, mass/volume ratio of 2 g/L, concentration of 100 mg/L, 24 hours). Adsorption equilibrium data best fit the Freundlich isotherm, indicating multilayer adsorption, while kinetic data followed a two-constant rate model, suggesting both physical and chemical sorption. Solution pH was found to have a significant impact, with V removal by MnOx most effective at low pH, likely due to the negative zeta potential of the MnOx under such conditions. MnOx reusability was investigated using repeated sorption and desorption experiments with 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M NaOH, and deionised water to regenerate the MnOx. The regenerated MnOx exhibited similar or enhanced ability to sorb V ions from solution. Overall, these results confirm the unique ability of MnOx as a reusable sorbent for V removal from acidic water, while also enhancing our mechanistic understanding of the removal process. This finding supports the development of sustainable solutions for acidic water treatment, contributing to efforts to address this critical environmental challenge."

      "abstract": "Vanadium compounds are known for their antidiabetic properties due to their ability to interfere with numerous mechanisms that lead to the decrease of blood glucose levels. Although some of these compounds have reached clinical trials and have the advantage of being orally administrable, no vanadium-containing drugs are currently available on the market, primarily due to the high doses required, which can lead intestinal and renal problems in case of long-term treatments. In this study, plant extracts obtained from olive leaves (Olea europaea L.) were combined with vanadium complexes with established antidiabetic activity with the aim of reducing their metal toxicity and, at the same time, amplifying their hypoglycemic action. The extracts were characterized by chromatographic and spectroscopic methods showing a composition rich in polyphenols and a high antioxidant activity. Formulations containing a vanadium complex (bis(maltolato)oxidovanadium(IV), BMOV, or bis(picolinato)oxidovanadium(IV), BPOV) mixed with different amount of olive leaves extract were tested in vitro to evaluate intestinal toxicity and hypoglycemic activity. The results demonstrated that the plant extracts are generally non-toxic toward human colon fibroblast in the whole range of tested concentrations and some of them are particularly effective in reducing the toxicity of the two vanadium compounds. Further in vitro tests conducted on differentiated human adipocyte cell lines revealed a significant increase in glucose uptake following treatment with the mixed formulations, compared to the effect of the individual components, indicating a synergistic effect. Immunocytochemical assays suggested that the translocation of GLUT4 transporter can be involved in the mechanism of action.",

Synthesized V/BP-MOF was introduced as a strong adsorbent of Congo Red (CR) and an effective agent in eliminating microbial species. In the investigation of CR absorption activity, several factors such as concentration of V/BP-MOF, pH, time, and temperature were investigated. Antimicrobial evaluations were carried out on Common bacterial strains in wastewater and values of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration) were reported. The V/BP-MOF was confirmed and characterized by EA, EDS, EDS mapping, FT-IR, XRD, TGA, BET, SEM, and TEM. In checking the characteristics of V/BP-MOF, size, specific surface area, and thermal stability were obtained, respectively, 68 nm, 325 m2/g, and 320°C. The highest adsorption of CR, at 94%, was obtained at natural pH, ambient temperature, and after 150 min. In kinetic studies, a correlation coefficient of 0.99 was observed with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, while in isotherm studies, a correlation coefficient of 0.97 was observed with the Freundlich isotherm model. In the biological evaluations, the best inhibition was against Escherichia coli, and MIC and MBC were observed as 4 μg/mL and 2 μg/mL, respectively. As a general result, V/BP-MOF can be introduced as a potent absorbent agent of CR dye and antimicrobial properties. Therefore, the compound synthesized in this study can be introduced as a suitable option for the wastewater treatment industry, with multiple capabilities including the removal of chemical pollutants and pathogenic agents."

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma, an aggressive cancer, is difficult to treat due to its location, late detection, drug resistance, and poor absorption of chemotherapeutics. Intratumoral drug administration offers a promising potential treatment alternative with localized delivery and minimal systemic toxicity. Vanadium(V) coordination complexes, incorporating Schiff base and catecholate ligands, have shown effects as antiproliferative agents with tunable efficacy and reactivity, stability, steric bulk, hydrophobicity, uptake, and toxicity optimized for the intratumoral administration vehicle. A new series of oxovanadium(V) Schiff base-catecholate complexes were synthesized and characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), UV-Vis, and infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Stability under physiological conditions was assessed via UV-Vis spectroscopy, and the antiproliferative activity was evaluated in T98G glioblastoma and SVG p12 normal glial cells using viability assays. The newly synthesized [VO(3-tBuHSHED)(TIPCAT)] complex was more stable (t1/2 ~4.5 h) and had strong antiproliferative activity (IC50 ~1.5 µM), comparing favorably with the current lead compound, [VO(HSHED)(DTB)]. The structural modifications enhanced stability, hydrophobicity, and steric bulk through substitution with iso-propyl and tert-butyl groups. The improved properties were attributed to steric hindrance associated with the new Schiff base and catecholato ligands, as well as the formation of non-toxic byproducts upon degradation. The [VO(3-tBuHSHED)(TIPCAT)] complex emerges as a promising candidate for glioblastoma therapy by demonstrating enhanced stability and a greater selectivity, which highlights the role of strategic ligand design in developing localized therapies for the treatment of resistant cancers. In reporting the new class of compounds effective against T98G glioblastoma cells, we describe the generally desirable properties that potential drugs being developed for intratumoral administration should have.",

However, most studies focus on the introduction of dielectric layers at the heterojunction interface to improve the passivating contact performance, with limited attention given to optimizing the TMO film for improved photoelectric performance. Herein, an in-situ hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) process is employed to modulate the photoelectric properties of vanadium oxide (V2Ox) film as well as the c-Si/V2Ox interface. With increased O vacancy density in V2Ox film and increased H bonds at c-Si/V2Ox interface, this c-Si/HPT-V2Ox contact shows reduced contact resistivity and improved passivation properties. A satisfied power conversion efficiency (PCE) of close to 23% is achieved on p-type c-Si solar cells with full area HPT-V2Ox rear hole selective contacts. The results show the high potential of V2Ox as thermal and environmental stable hole selective contact for photovoltaic applications."

      "abstract": "Vanadium is a bioactive trace element with variable valence. Its pentavalent form has been confirmed to be capable of predominantly regulating the early and mid-stage osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) without tumor inhibition, while its tetravalent form exhibits tumor inhibition but only primarily modulates late osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis. In this study, a multifunctional bone tissue scaffold consisting of mixed-valence vanadium-doped mesoporous bioactive glass and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (V(IV/V)-MBG/PLGA) was developed to simultaneously inhibit the recurrence of osteosarcoma and promote the regeneration of operative bone defects. The in vitro results showed that the V(IV) and V(V) species could be sustainably released from V(IV/V)-MBG and complementarily enhance the proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and mineralization of BMSCs by activating multiple signaling pathways throughout the whole osteogenesis process. More importantly, the co-existence of mixed-valent vanadium species was able to continuously stimulate the generation of excessive ROS and the depletion of GSH by synergistically supplying an appropriate ratio of V(IV) and V(V) to thermodynamically and kinetically maintain the stable self-circulation of the valence state alteration, thus inducing UMR-106 cell death. In a rat model, V(IV/V)-MBG/PLGA scaffolds effectively suppressed tumor invasion and promoted bone regeneration. These results suggest that V(IV/V)-MBG/PLGA scaffolds are a promising strategy for treating tumor-associated bone defects, offering dual tumor inhibition and bone regeneration.",

      "abstract": "Vanadium (V) has garnered attention due to its pharmacological properties; however, its toxic effects have also been documented. Among the vanadium compounds that are found in the environment, vanadium trioxide (V2O3) has attracted interest because of its impact on biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. However, its precise mechanism of action remains unclear, although it is suspected to be related to oxidative stress. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the mechanisms involved in DNA damage and the associated cellular response pathways. Primary cultures of human lymphocytes were exposed to 2, 4, 8, or 16 µg/mL V2O3. DNA damage due to oxidized bases was evaluated via a comet assay. The expression levels of sensor proteins (ATM and ATR) involved in DNA damage were determined via Western blotting, and the mRNA expression levels of metallothionein 1 (Mt-1) and genes involved in DNA repair (OGG1, APE1, XPB, XPD, MRE11, RAD50, Ku70, and Ku80) were estimated via RT-PCR and qPCR. The results showed that V2O3 is an oxidant that is responsible for DNA damage through oxidized bases, as demonstrated by increased DNA migration in the presence of the FPG enzyme. At the molecular level, V2O3 treatment also increased ATM protein expression. In terms of mRNA expression, the overexpression of Mt-1, OGG1, APE1, Ku70, and Ku80 was observed. This finding suggests that DNA damage is primarily repaired via two mechanisms: base excision repair (BER) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). In conclusion, one mechanism of action of V2O3 involves the oxidation of nitrogenous bases in DNA, the activation of damage sensors (such as ATMs), and the overexpression of Mt-1 as part of the antioxidant response to mitigate the effects of V and facilitate DNA repair pathways (including BER and NHEJ)."

      "abstract": "MXenzymes, a promising class of catalytic therapeutic material, offer great potential for tumor treatment, but they encounter significant obstacles due to suboptimal catalytic efficiency and kinetics in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, this study draws inspiration from the electronic structure of transition metal vanadium, proposing the leverage of TME specific-features to induce structural transformations in sheet-like vanadium carbide MXenzymes (TVMz). These transformations trigger cascading catalytic reactions that amplify oxidative stress, thereby significantly enhancing multimodal tumor therapy. Specifically, the engineered HTVMz, coated with hyaluronic acid, exhibits good stability and generates a thermal effect under NIR-II laser irradiation. The thermal effect, combined with TME characteristics, facilities a structural transformation into ultra-small vanadium oxide nanozymes (VOx). The enlarged surface area of VOx substantially enhances ROS regeneration and amplifies oxidative stress, which promotes lysosomal permeability and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. The high-valent vanadium in VOx interacts with intracellular glutathione, disrupting redox homeostasis and intensifying oxidative stress further. These amplifications accelerate tumor apoptosis, induce ferroptosis, and suppress HSP90 expression. Consequently, the heightened thermal sensitivity of HTVMz synergistically promotes tumor cell death via multimodal therapeutic pathways. This study presents an innovative strategy for tumor catalytic therapy by manipulating MXenzymes structures, advancing the field of catalytic therapy.",

Here, we synthesize a kind of vanadium dioxide nanoparticle encapsulated in bovine serum albumin and containing disulfide bonds (VSB NPs) for photothermal-enhanced ferroptosis and pyroptosis effects. Mechanism studies show that disulfide bonds can effectively consume overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment, leading to a decrease in glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) activity. Simultaneously, tetravalent vanadium can induce a catalytic reaction of overexpressed H2O2, producing plenty of toxic hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2), leading to tumor cell ferroptosis. In addition, the consumption of disulfide bonds can also lead to the degradation of nanoparticles into high-valent vanadates, activating thermal protein domain-associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes and causing tumor cell pyroptosis. It is worth mentioning that VSB NPs can not only ablate tumor cells under near-infrared light irradiation but also further disrupt the redox homeostasis of the tumor microenvironment, thereby enhancing the ferroptosis and pyroptosis of tumor cells induced by biodegradable vanadium-based nanomaterials. This strategy, based on the biological effects of vanadium to regulate the redox state in tumor cells, provides possibilities for cancer treatment.",

LPS induce the release of cytokines by microglia and mediate the upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-a mechanism also associated with amyloidosis. Curcumin is a recognized natural medicine but has extremely low bioavailability. V-Cur, a novel hemocompatible Vanadium(IV)-curcumin complex with higher solubility and bioactivity than curcumin, is studied here. Co-cultures consisting of rat primary neurons and microglia were treated with LPS and/or curcumin or V-Cur. V-Cur disrupted LPS-induced overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the in vitro aggregation of human insulin (HI), more effectively than curcumin. Cell stimulation with LPS also increased full-length, inactive, and total iNOS levels, and the inflammation markers IL-1β and TNF-α. Both curcumin and V-Cur alleviated these effects, with V-Cur reducing iNOS levels more than curcumin. Complementary insights into possible bioactivity mechanisms of both curcumin and V-Cur were provided by In silico molecular docking calculations on Aβ1-42, APP, Aβ fibrils, HI, and iNOS. This study renders curcumin-based compounds a promising anti-inflammatory intervention that may be proven a strong tool in the effort to mitigate neurodegenerative disease pathology and neuroinflammatory conditions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vanadium (VAN) is a significant trace element, but its higher exposure is reported to cause severe organ toxicity. Tectochrysin (TEC) is a naturally derived flavonoid which demonstrates a wide range of pharmacological properties. AIM: The current study was planned to assess the cardioprotective potential of TEC against VAN induced cardiotoxicity in rats via regulating biochemical, and histological profile. RESEARCH PLAN: Thirty-six male Sprague Dawley rats were apportioned into four groups including the control, VAN (1.5 mg/kg) treated, VAN (1.5 mg/kg) + TEC (2.5 mg/kg) administrated as well as TEC (2.5 mg/kg) alone supplemented group. The doses were administrated for 28 days through oral gavage. The biochemical and histological parameters were evaluated by using qRT-PCR, ELISA, biochemical assays, histological as well as molecular simulation techniques. FINDINGS: VAN intoxication reduced the activities of catalase (CAT) (84.25 %), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (65.28 %), glutathione reductase (GSR) (78.52 %), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (81.81 %), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (83.71 %) and glutathione (GSH) (76.86 %) contents while upregulating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (87.26 %) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (91.32 %). Moreover, VAN administration increased the gene expressions of nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) (91.47 %), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (92.51 %), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (83.63 %), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (89.43 %), janus kinase 1 (JAK1) (95.55 %), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (91.25 %), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) (81.31 %), interleukin-18 (IL-18) (93.27 %), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) (85.79 %) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (82.12 %). The levels of CK-MB (89.43 %), BNP (91.73 %), NT-proBNP (93.64 %), CPK (87.56 %), LDH (92.62 %), troponin I (94.25 %), troponin T (97.53 %) and CRP (88.45 %) were increased following the VAN intoxication. Besides, VAN exposure upregulated the levels of Caspase-9 (89.52 %), Bax (95.52 %) and Caspase-3 (92.52 %) while reducing the levels of Bcl-2 (75.66 %). The structural integrity of cardiac tissues was extensively disrupted following VAN-induced intoxication. However, TEC treatment remarkably ameliorated cardiotoxicity via regulating abovementioned dysregulations induced by VAN exposure. At the end, molecular docking (MD) analysis was accomplished to confirm the potential protective effect of TEC against VAN prompted cardiac dysfunction. It was detected that TEC can strongly bind with the active site of JAK1, NF-kB and STAT3 which also confirm its cardioprotective effect against VAN provoked cardiac dysfunction. CONCLUSION: VAN intoxication instigated cardiac impairments which is evident by dysregulations in biochemical as well as histological profile of cardiac tissues. Nonetheless, TEC treatment remarkably protected the cardiac tissues via regulating oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. TEC could be employed as cardioprotective agent against VAN induced cardiotoxicity.",

The all-vanadium-based lithium-ion full battery shows good cycle performance at 0.1C and stable charge/discharge abilities at large current densities. The electrochemical performance of the full battery results from the low impedance and pseudocapacitance-dominated lithium storage mechanism derived from the micro-nano yolk-shell structure."

      "abstract": "The anti-tumor efficacy of current pharmacotherapy is severely hampered due to the adaptive evolution of tumors, urgently needing effective therapeutic strategies capable of breaking such adaptability. Metabolic reprogramming, as an adaptive survival mechanism, is closely related to therapy resistance of tumors. Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells exhibit a high energy dependency that is sustained by an adaptive metabolic conversion between glucose and glutamine, helping tumor cells to withstand nutrient-deficient microenvironments and various treatments. We discover that transition metal vanadium (V) effectively inhibits glucose metabolism in CRC and synergizes with glutaminase inhibitors (BPTES) to disrupt CRC's energy dependency. Thus, a dual energy metabolism suppression nanosystem (VSi-BP@HA) is engineered by loading BPTES into V-doped hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles. This nanosystem effectively dampens CRC energy metabolism, eradicating 33% of tumors in mice. Strikingly, the cell biological and preclinical model datasets provide compelling evidence showing that VSi-BP@HA not only reverses CRC cells chemo-resistance but also drastically potentiates anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Therefore, this nanosystem provides not only a promising approach to suppress CRC, but also a potential adjunct tool for enhancing chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",

Inspired by the heme structures and biocatalytic activities of horseradish peroxidase, we introduce the synthesis of vanadium single-atoms (SAV) coordinated artificial peroxidases as BLISA for highly sensitive and selective carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunoassay. Our synthesized SAV exhibits peroxidase (POD)-like activity that is both efficacious and highly specific, surpassing the performance of many other single-atom-structured materials. The SAV-linked immunoassay demonstrates an ultrasensitive response to the target antigen (CEA), with a linear detection range spanning 0.03-10 ng/mL and an impressively low detection limit of 0.335 ng/mL. This straightforward and robust immunoassay technique not only achieves superior signal amplification compared to traditional natural enzymes but also boasts high precision, commendable reproducibility, and remarkable specificity, aligning closely with conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for CEA detection in serum samples. This study offers a blueprint for designing artificial peroxidase-based colorimetric nanosystems, promoting the evolution of ultrasensitive BLISA applications for the early diagnosis and intervention of cancer.",

CoMoO4@GF have large specific surface area, super hydrophilicity, and abundant reaction places, possessing well mass transfer, low charge transfer resistance, and sufficient catalytic sites. Therefore, the composite electrodes exhibit great electrocatalytic activity towards VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox reactions and excellent stability for VRFB. At 200 mA cm-2, the energy efficiency (EE) of the CoMoO4@GF modified VRFB improved by 19.14 % over the blank VRFB with pristine graphite felt, and remained cycle stable after 350 cycles at 150 mA cm-2.

These properties are critical for effective intracellular uptake, as drugs or prodrugs must cross cellular membranes to target specific organelles like mitochondria, essential for maximizing therapeutic impact. Bio-essential metal ions such as copper, zinc, and iron are transported through specialized active channels, whereas others depend on passive diffusion to enter cells. Vanadium has gained significant attention in research because of its remarkable coordination flexibility, lipid-lowering characteristics, and potential anticancer effects. The coordination flexibility of vanadium has led to its investigation in pharmaceuticals, given its demonstrated insulin-mimetic effects, lipid-lowering properties, and promising antitumor activities. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a targeted cancer treatment approach through light-activated compounds that selectively generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce cell death. Among metal-based photosensitizers, vanadium complexes are emerging as effective agents due to their unique redox properties and known biological activity. This minireview explores mitochondria-targeting vanadium complexes within PDT. Mitochondria serve as an ideal ROS generation site, triggering apoptosis while minimizing damage to healthy cells. We examine key strategies in designing vanadium complexes that enhance mitochondrial localization, photodynamic efficiency, and cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. This review highlights the challenges like photostability and selective targeting, and future directions for advancing vanadium-based photosensitizers as next-generation PDT cancer therapies.",

The polyamines, including the Spm, Spd, and Put, induced with Si about 41.37 %, 33.12 %, and 27.90 %, respectively, in V stress. Moreover, the Si application decline in the leaf and root V contents, which was around 49.5 % and 40.74 %, respectively, then the V stress plants. The soluble protein, proline, and Si level in root/leaf with Si treatment significantly induced around 55.55/50.22 %, 42.85/55.35 %, and 49.92/85.29 %, respectively, as compared to the V stress. Si also heightened the nitrate reductase (NR), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) levels. Our study revealed that Si maintained the PSII integrity and induced PSII efficiency genes. Si preserves the membrane stability, as evidenced by less accumulation in EL, H2O2, and MDA levels. The Si also induces the AsA-GSH to eliminate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pepper plants. In summary, our research elucidated that Si addition improved pepper plants' tolerance to V toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Vanadium oxides are widely tunable materials, with many thermodynamically stable phases suitable for applications spanning catalysis to neuromorphic computing. The stability of vanadium in a range of oxidation states enables mixed-valence polymorphs of kinetically accessible metastable materials. Low-temperature synthetic routes to, and the properties of, these metastable materials are poorly understood and may unlock new optoelectronic and magnetic functionalities for expanded applications. In this work, we demonstrate topochemical reduction of α-V2O5 to produce metastable vanadium oxide phases with tunable oxygen vacancies (>6%) and simultaneous substitutional tin incorporation (>3.5%). The chemistry is carried out at low temperature (65 °C) with solution-phase SnCl2, where Sn2+ is oxidized to Sn4+ as V5+ sites are reduced to V4+ during oxygen vacancy formation. Despite high oxygen vacancy and tin concentrations, the transformations are topochemical in that the symmetry of the parent crystal remains intact, although the unit cell expands. Band structure calculations show that these vacancies contribute electrons to the lattice, whereas substitutional tin contributes holes, yielding a compensation doping effect and control over the electronic properties. The SnCl2 redox chemistry is effective on both solution-processed V2O5 nanoparticle inks and mesoporous films cast from untreated inks, enabling versatile routes toward functional films with tunable optical and electronic properties. The electrical conductance rises concomitantly with the SnCl2 concentration and treatment time, indicating a net increase in density of free electrons in the host lattice. This work provides a valuable demonstration of kinetic tailoring of electronic properties of vanadium-oxygen systems through top-down chemical manipulation from known thermodynamic phases."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vanadium is a widely used transition metal in industrial applications, but it also poses significant neurotoxic and environmental risks. Previous studies have shown that exposure to vanadium may lead to neurodegenerative diseases and neuropathic pain, raising concerns about its impact on human health and the ecosystem. To address vanadium neurotoxicity, through targeting NMDA glutamate and dopamine signaling, both involved in neurodegenerative disorders, shows promise. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we evaluated a novel compound with a mixed NMDA glutamate receptor-dopamine transporter pharmacology, ZA-II-05 and found it effectively ameliorated vanadium-induced neurotoxicity, suggesting a potential neuroprotective role. METHODS: Synchronized young adult worms were assigned to four different experimental groups; Controls; 100 mM of Vanadium; Vanadium and 1 mg/ml ZA-II-05; and ZA-II-05 alone. These were examined with different markers, including DAPI, MitoTracker Green and MitoSox stains for assessment of nuclei and mitochondrial density and oxidative stress, respectively. RESULTS: Exposure to vanadium in C. elegans resulted in decreased nuclear presence and reduction in mitochondrial content were also analyzed based on fluorescence in the pharyngeal region, signifying an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species, while vanadium co-treatment with ZA-II-05 caused a significant increase in nuclear presence and mitochondrial content. DISCUSSION: Treatment with ZA-II-05 significantly preserved cellular integrity, exhibiting a reversal of the detrimental effects induced by vanadium by modulating and preserving the normal function of chemosensory neurons and downstream signaling pathways. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of vanadium-induced neurotoxicity and offers perspectives for developing therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative diseases related to environmental toxins.",

      "abstract": "Vanadium(V) contaminated soil is abundant in iron(Fe) oxides due to co-occurrence of V and Fe bearing minerals. However, biogeochemical transformation of redox-active V and Fe in soil, and the bacteria involved, has remained less investigated. This study explored the extent to which microbial mediated organic decomposition coupled to Fe(III) reduction contributed to V(V) release/reduction in V-contaminated paddy soil under different organic amendments. Soil flooding decreased toxic reducible V while increased less toxic oxidizable V. Glucose and straw promoted V(V) release with temporarily increasing V(V) concentration by 73.59-106.34 mg/kg compared to the control treatment and subsequently promoted V(V) reduction with decreasing V(V) to concentrations eventually similar to the control treatment. Biochar incorporation under glucose and straw amendments moderately alleviated V(V) release. The significantly positive correlation between Fe(II) and V(V) concentrations during the V solubilization process indicated a temporal coupling of Fe(III) reduction and V(V) release. Clostridium and Massilia mediated Fe(III) reductive dissolution and V(V) release, while Anaeromyxobacter, Sphingomonas, Bryobacter, Acidobacteriaceae and Anaerolineaceae contributed to V(V) reduction. This study provides a deeper understanding of V biotransformation coupled to Fe and C cycling and suggests a remediation strategy for V-contaminated soils via regulating Fe(III) reduction to weaken V(V) release or to promote V(V) reduction.",

      "abstract": "The electron transfer ability of biofilms significantly influences the electrochemical activity of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). However, there is limited understanding of pentavalent vanadium (V(V)) bioreduction and microbial response characteristics in MFCs. In this study, the effect of gradient concentrations of V(V) on the performance of EABs with Shewanella putrefaciens in MFCs was investigated. The results showed that as V(V) concentration increased (0-100 mg/L), the voltage output, power densities, polarization, and electrode potential decreased. V(V) was found to act as an electron acceptor and was reduced during MFCs operation, with a yield of 83.16% being observed at 25 mg/L V(V). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicated declining electrochemical performance of the MFCs with escalating V(V) concentration. The content of protein and polysaccharide from extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in anodic biofilms increased to 66.75 and 49.15 mg/L at 75 mg/L V(V), respectively. Three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed increased humic substances in EPS extraction with V(V) exposure. The functional genes narG, nirK, and gor involved in V(V) reduction were upregulated with rising V(V) concentration through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Additionally, riboflavin, cytochrome c, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and electron transport system activity (ETSA), key indicators for assessing electron transfer behavior, exhibited a negative correlation with various V(V) concentrations, decreasing by 31.81%, 57.14%, 67.39%, and 51.41%, respectively, at a concentration of 100 mg/L V(V) compared to the blank control. These findings contribute valuable insights into the response of EABs to V(V) exposure, presenting potential strategies for enhancing their effectiveness in the treatment of vanadium-contaminated wastewater.",

However, the effect of microbial-induced phosphate precipitation (MIPP) on HMs behavior in vanadium tailing slags has not been revealed. This study is the first to report the influence of MIPP on multiple HMs including Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the slags with and without soil mixing. The results showed that MIPP exhibited excellent ability for Cd immobilization, Cd immobilization rate reached 43.41 % under the optimal parameters within 7 days. Cd immobilization performance was significantly improved and sustained after the slags were covered with soil, resulting from better colonization of phosphate mineralizing bacteria in slag-soil mixtures. Surprisingly, DTPA-Cu, Zn and Pb contents in slags were all increased to varying degrees after MIPP treatment. Leaching solution mineralization tests further suggested that MIPP significantly reduced the concentration of Cd2+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Al3+, but barely changed Cu2+ and Zn2+ concentrations. Characterization analysis confirmed that formation of phosphates including Cd(PO4)2 and dissolution of minerals including PbZnSiO2 were the reason for HMs immobilization and mobilization in vanadium tailing slags. This study provides new insights for understanding biomineralization technology and using MIPP to remediate HMs contaminated mine waste.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of diabetes mellitus and diabetes-related complications is rapidly increasing worldwide, placing a substantial financial burden on healthcare systems. Approximately 537 million adults are currently diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes globally. However, interestingly, the increasing morbidity rate is primarily influenced by the effects of long-term hyperglycemia on vital organs such as the brain, the liver and the heart rather than the ability of the body to use glucose effectively. This can be attributed to the summation of the detrimental effects of excessive glucose on major vascular systems and the harmful side effects attributed to the current treatment associated with managing the disease. These drugs have been implicated in the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease, hepatocyte injury and cognitive dysfunction, thereby warranting extensive research into alternative treatment strategies. Literature has shown significant progress in utilizing metal-based compounds, specifically those containing transition metals such as zinc, magnesium and vanadium, in managing hyperglycaemia. Amongst these metals, research carried out on vanadium reflected the most promising anti-diabetic efficacy in cell culture and animal studies. This was attributed to the ability to improve glucose management in the bloodstream by enhancing its uptake and metabolism in the kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, heart and liver. Despite this, organic vanadium was considered toxic due to its accumulative characteristics. To alleviate vanadium's toxic nature while subsequently manipulating its therapeutic properties, vanadium complexes were synthesized using either vanadate or vanadyl as a base compound. This review attempts to evaluate organic vanadium salts' therapeutic and toxic effects, highlight vanadium complexes' research and provide insight into the novel dioxidovanadium complex synthesized in our laboratory to alleviate hyperglycaemia-associated macrovascular complications in the brain, heart and liver."

This study explored the anti-inflammatory activity of silibinin and elucidate the mechanisms by which it operates in a mouse model of vanadium-induced lung injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight-week-old male BALB/c mice were exposed to V2O5 to induce lung injury. Mice were pretreated with silibinin at doses of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg. Histological analyses were performed to assess cell viability and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and activation of the MAPK and NF-[Formula: see text]B signaling pathways, as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome, were evaluated using real-time PCR, western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Whole blood analysis was conducted to measure white blood cell counts. RESULTS: Silibinin treatment significantly improved cell viability, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in V2O5-induced lung injury. It also notably suppressed the activation of the MAPK and NF-[Formula: see text]B signaling pathways, along with a marked reduction in NLRP3 inflammasome expression levels in lung tissues. Additionally, silibinin-treated groups exhibited a significant decrease in white blood cell counts, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the potent anti-inflammatory effects of silibinin in mice with V2O5-induced lung inflammation, highlighting its therapeutic potential. The study not only confirms the efficacy of silibinin in mitigating inflammatory responses but also provides a foundational understanding of its role in modulating key inflammatory pathways, paving the way for future therapeutic strategies against pulmonary inflammation induced by environmental pollutants.",

The loss of redox sites and competitive adsorption of H2O prevalent in the treatment of industrial exhaust gases are the main reasons for the weak mineralization ability and poor water vapor resistance of V-based catalysts. In this work, platinum (Pt) is selected to combine with the V/CeO2 catalyst, which provides more redox sites and H2O dissociative activation sites and further enhances its catalytic performance. The results show that PtV/CeO2 achieves 90% of the CO2 yield at 318 °C and maintains excellent catalytic activity rather than continuous deactivation within 15 h after water vapor injection. The formation of Pt-O-V bonds enhances the redox ability and promotes deep oxidation of polychlorinated intermediates, accounting for the significantly improved mineralization ability of PtV/CeO2. The dissociative activation effect of Pt on H2O molecules strengthens the migration and activation of V-adsorbed H2O, precluding V-poisoning and notably improving water resistance.

This paper reports the influence of carbon structural characteristics of sustainable walnut shell-derived carbons in carbon/polyvinylidene fluoride composite electrodes on vanadium redox reactions. Pyrolysis, gasification, and chemical treatment procedures were used to modify the structural characteristics of carbons. Carbon functional groups were modified by chemical treatment with HNO3, heat treatment with K2CO3, and high-temperature NH3 treatment. Carbon porous structures were characterized using gas adsorption studies. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the carbon molecular structure. Functional groups were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, acid/base titrations, temperature-programmed desorption, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The influence of carbon structure, porosity, and surface functional groups on the redox reactions of vanadium was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and electrical impedance spectroscopy. The VO2+/VO2 + and V2+/V3+ couples had well-defined peaks in cyclic voltammetry, with the former being the most intense, but the V3+/VO2+ couple was not observed for samples carbonized under nitrogen. The results show that V2+/V3+ and VO2+/VO2 + couples observed in cyclic voltammograms were enhanced for carbonization temperatures up to 800 °C. Electrical impedance spectroscopy also showed impedance trends. The electrochemistry results are primarily related to changes in carbon structure and the catalysis of V3+ oxidation by surface functional groups in the carbon structure. The V3+/VO2+ couple was limited by slow kinetics, but it occurs on specific oxygen and nitrogen sites in the carbon structure. The oxidation of V(iii) to V(iv) only occurs on a limited number of surface sites, and the outer-sphere electron transfer to oxidize V(iii) takes place at much more positive potentials. The coulombic, voltage, and energy efficiency of the carbon electrodes were suitable for batteries."

      "abstract": "Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is considered a promising material for electrochromic supercapacitors due to its rich color transitions and excellent electrochemical capacity. However, V2O5 exhibits low electrical conductivity, and its volume changes dramatically during charge-discharge cycles, leading to structural collapse and poor long-term cyclability. These issues have hindered the development and application of V2O5. In this study, copper vanadium oxide yolk-shell microspheres (CVO) were synthesized through a one-step solvent heat treatment with an annealing process. With the doping of copper element, the capacitance, conductivity, and cyclic stability of CVO microspheres were significantly enhanced. Subsequently, the sphere-wire network structure was formed by blending Na2V6O16·3H2O nanowires (NVO), resulting in the formation of CVO/NVO composites. The three-dimensional sphere-wire network efficiently facilitates the acquisition of additional redox sites and strengthens the material-to-substrate bonding. Under the combined influence of these favorable factors, CVO/NVO achieved a high specific capacitance of 39.2 mF cm-2, with a capacitance retention of 84% after 7500 cycles at a current density of 0.7 mA cm-2. The fully inorganic solid-state electrochromic supercapacitor (ECSC), assembled on the basis of CVO/NVO, demonstrates a vivid and clearly distinguishable color change (ΔE* = 37). Even more impressive is the energy storage capacity (18.4 mF·cm-2) and the cycling stability (up to 89% retention after 10,000 cycles) exhibited by the devices. These key performances are superior to those of most of the previously reported V2O5-based ECSCs, opening a promising avenue for the development of V2O5-based electrochromic energy storage devices."

      "abstract": "The disorderly discharge of industrial wastewater containing heavy metals has caused serious water pollution and ecological environmental risks, ultimately threatening human life and health. Biological treatment methods have obvious advantages, but the existing microorganisms exhibit issues such as poor resistance, adaptability, colonization ability, and low activity. However, a wide variety of microorganisms in deep-sea hydrothermal vent areas are tolerant to heavy metals, possessing the potential for efficient treatment of heavy metal wastewater. Based on this, the study obtained a group of deep-sea microbial communities dominated by Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia through shake flask experiments from the sediments of deep-sea hydrothermal vents, which can simultaneously achieve the synchronous removal of vanadium and cadmium heavy metals through bioreduction, biosorption, and biomineralization. Through SEM-EDS, XRD, XPS, and FT-IR analyses, it was found that V(V) was reduced to V(IV) through a reduction process and subsequently precipitated. Glucose oxidation accelerated this process. Cd(II) underwent biomineralization to form precipitates such as cadmium hydroxide and cadmium carbonate. Functional groups on the microbial cell surface, such as -CH2, C=O, N-H, -COOH, phosphate groups, amino groups, and M-O moieties, participated in the bioadsorption processes of V(V) and Cd(II) heavy metals. Under optimal conditions, namely a temperature of 40 °C, pH value of 7.5, inoculation amount of 10%, salinity of 4%, COD concentration of 600 mg/L, V5+ concentration of 300 mg/L, and Cd2+ concentration of 40 mg/L, the OD600 can reach its highest at 72 h, with the removal efficiency of V5+, Cd2+, and COD in simulated vanadium smelting wastewater reaching 86.32%, 59.13%, and 61.63%, respectively. This study provides theoretical insights and practical evidence for understanding the dynamic changes in microbial community structure under heavy metal stress, as well as the resistance mechanisms of microbial treatment of industrial heavy metal wastewater.",

Low energy density is the main factor restricting its development. In this study, the carbon felt used as the electrode was pretreated in various ways to improve the performance of the vanadium redox flow battery. The pretreatment conditions of carbon felt were compared to the performance of carbon felt after treatment at different temperatures and different times. The properties of the pretreated carbon felt were investigated and their effect on cell performance was tested.Next, by introducing a noble metal catalyst into the carbon felt, the characteristics of the carbon felt were studied and the effect on the performance of the vanadium redox flow battery was investigated. It was found that Carbon felt thermal-treated at 500 °C for 2 h showed the best characteristics and had the longest charge/discharge time and the lowest resistance. The results also show that Carbon felt with catalyst introduced without PTFE(Polytetrafluoroethylene) binder showed larger BET(Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area and electrical conductivity compared to PTFE mixed, and cell performance was also excellent."

Also, the emulsion stability was considerably improved, and the leakage percentage was reduced to 16% after 3 days.

However, efficient separation of vanadium from these residues is challenging due to its strong oxidation resistance and coating within silicate inclusions. To address this issue, this study proposes an enhanced leaching process utilizing the synergistic effect of O3-catalyzed ultrasonic field in a low concentration sulfuric acid system. Results show that following a 10-minute O3 and ultrasonic treatment, the direct leaching rate of vanadium experienced a remarkable 46.7 % increase. Quenching experiments revealed a hierarchical order of active species within the reaction process:⋅OH >⋅O2-> H+, with⋅OH oxidation exhibiting the most pronounced capacity for disrupting the inclusion structure. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance analysis indicated that the highest⋅OH yield arose from the combined application of ultrasound and ozone. Kinetic investigations demonstrated that the vanadium leaching process is governed by interfacial chemical reactions. The activation energy of vanadium oxidation leaching under ultrasonic-O3 conditions was determined to be 40.41 kJ/mol, representing a 20.19 % reduction compared to ultrasonic conditions alone. Through the integration of analysis, characterization, and comparative evaluations, it was discerned that the synergistic impact of ultrasonic and ozone treatments significantly enhances the breakdown of silicate inclusions by low-concentration HF, particularly in the conversion of SiOSi bonds into SiOH bonds and SiF bonds. In summary, the refined leaching methodology incorporating ozone catalysis in conjunction with ultrasonic treatment provides a new idea for the separation and extraction of refractory residual vanadium."

However, the relatively high price of vanadium has hindered the development of vanadate-based photocatalysts for various applications. Spent catalysts obtained from oil refineries typically contain a significant quantity of vanadium, making them valuable for recovery and utilization as precursors for the production of high-value-added photocatalysts. In this study, we transformed the V present in spent catalysts produced by the petrochemical industry into ternary vanadate-based photocatalysts [BiVO4/InVO4/Ag3VO4 (BVO/IVO/AVO, respectively)] designed for water remediation. The ternary composites revealed an enhanced photocatalytic capability, which was 1.42 and 5.1 times higher than those of the binary BVO/IVO and pristine AVO due to the facilitated charge separation. The ternary photocatalysts not only effectively treated wastewater containing various organic dyes, such as methylene blue (MB), rhodamine 6G (R6G), and brilliant green (BG), but also exhibited remarkable photocatalytic performance in the degradation of antibiotics, reduction of Cr(VI), and bacterial inactivation. This paper proposes a feasible route for recycling industrial waste as a source of vanadium to produce highly efficient vanadate-based photocatalysts.",

Herein, a universal surface modification strategy is proposed to effectively improve the photothermal performance of vanadium carbide MXene nanosheets (L-V2C) with the removal of surface impurity ions and generation of mesopores. Subsequently, MnOx coating capable of T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can be in situ formed through surface redox reaction on L-V2C, and then, stable nanoplatforms (LVM-PEG) under physiological conditions can be obtained after further PEGylation. In the tumor microenvironment irradiated by NIR-II laser, multivalent Mn ions released from LVM-PEG, as a reversible electronic station, can consume the overexpression of glutathione and catalyze a Fenton-like reaction to produce ·OH, resulting in synchronous cellular oxidative damage. Efficient synergistic therapy promotes immunogenic cell death, improving tumor-related immune microenvironment and immunomodulation, and thus, LVM-PEG can demonstrate high accuracy and excellent anticancer efficiency guided by multimodal imaging. As a result, this study provides a new approach for the customization of 2D surface strategies and the study of synergistic therapy mechanisms, highlighting the application of MXene-based materials in the biomedical field.",

This study synthesized a graphitic carbon nitride-enhanced vanadium ferrite (VFe2O4@g-C3N4) as a photocatalyst for degrading SUF, CIP and ERY in an aqueous solution. VFe2O4@g-C3N4 was characterized with X-ray diffractometry (XRD), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The XRD characterization of VFe2O4@g-C3N4 revealed diffraction patterns with a crystallite size of 22.45 nm and a bandgap energy of 1.94 eV. The SEM image revealed the surface to be rough with irregular particle shape and size. The TEM image showed an average particle size of 92.47 nm. VFe2O4@g-C3N4 exhibited a degradation efficiency, which showed complete removal of SUF (100 %) from solution while the efficiency towards CIP is 94 ± 0.60 % and 90 ± 0.8 % towards ERY. The best photocatalytic performance was achieved with 0.12 g L-1 of VFe2O4@g-C3N4 and pH = 7.0 as the optimal conditions for achieving complete removal of SUF, CIP and ERY at a concentration lower than 10.00 mg L-1 under visible-light irradiation. The photodegradation of SUF, CIP and ERY by VFe2O4@g-C3N4 was found to be promoted by ROS with ˙OH and SO4˙- radicals playing a significant role. VFe2O4@g-C3N4 demonstrated a regeneration capacity that is above 90 % at the 10th cycle of regeneration treatment, suggesting it to be stable and reusable with the X-ray diffraction pattern remaining unchanged and no leaching of VFe2O4@g-C3N4 into solution. The result from the study reveals VFe2O4@g-C3N4 as a promising photocatalyst for removing antibiotics from an aqueous solution.",

Chemical preintercalation of inorganic metal ions affects the interlayer spacing, yet expansion is limited by the hydrated ion radii. Herein, we demonstrate that using varying concentrations of decyltrimethylammonium (DTA+) and cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA+) cations in chemical preintercalation synthesis followed by hydrothermal treatment, the interlayer distance of hybrid bilayered vanadium oxides (BVOs) can be tuned between 11.1 Å and 35.6 Å. Our analyses reveal that these variations in interlayer spacing are due to different amounts of structural water and alkylammonium cations confined within the interlayer regions. Increased concentrations of alkylammonium cations not only expand the interlayer spacing but also induce local bending and disordering of the V-O bilayers. Electrochemical cycling of hybrid BVO electrodes in non-aqueous lithium-ion cells show that specific capacities decrease as interlayer regions expand, suggesting that the densely packed alkylammonium cations obstruct intercalation sites and hinder Li+ ion transport. Furthermore, we found that greater layer separation facilitates the dissolution of active material into the electrolyte, resulting in rapid capacity decay during extended cycling. This study emphasizes that layered electrode materials require both spacious interlayer regions as well as high structural and chemical stabilities, providing guidelines for structural engineering of organic-inorganic hybrids."

      "abstract": "Petcoke generated during bitumen upgrading is a potential source of vanadium for the global market. Recovering vanadium from the fly ash originating from the combustion of petcoke appears to be a suitable route for commercial implementation, given its high extraction rate. Although the technical feasibility of the recovery process has been proven, the environmental impact should be addressed. Information on the greenhouse (GHG) emissions from the process is scarce in the public domain. Therefore, a framework was developed for assessment of life cycle GHG emissions for extraction of vanadium from petcoke-based fly ash. This framework was used to perform a life cycle GHG emissions assessment of a water leaching and salt roasting process to extract vanadium from fly ash. For the upstream GHG emissions, we collected direct emissions data and energy consumption from the literature, and, for the process emissions, we developed a model to estimate energy and material balances based on process conditions. The emission factors for electricity production, fuel combustion, production of consumables, and gas treatment were used to obtain the life cycle GHG emissions. The results show that the life cycle GHG emission of vanadium recovery are 26.6-3.9+0.9 kg CO2eq/kg V2O5; 66% of these are direct GHG emissions. The process GHG emissions from fly ash decarbonization contribute the most to the life cycle GHG emissions. The air-to-fuel ratio for roasting and the GHG emission factors for petcoke combustion and the gas treatment operation are the inputs that most effect the model output. Compared with the production of V2O5 from vanadium titano-magnetite ore and bitumen upgrading spent catalyst, the petcoke fly ash pathway generates about twice the life cycle GHG emissions. This study's results can help determine areas of improvement in the upstream operations and the recovery process to reduce the life cycle GHG emissions to levels that can compete with primary and alternative routes to produce vanadium pentoxide. The results of this study can help in decision-making associated with vanadium extract from fly ash produced from combustion of petcoke.",

      "abstract": "Chronic environmental exposure to toxic heavy metals, which often occurs as a mixture through occupational and industrial sources, has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including Parkinsonism. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) typically presents along with manganese (Mn), especially in welding rods and high-capacity batteries, including electric vehicle batteries; however, the neurotoxic effects of vanadium (V) and Mn co-exposure are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the neurotoxic impact of MnCl2, V2O5, and MnCl2-V2O5 co-exposure in an animal model. C57BL/6 mice were intranasally administered either de-ionized water (vehicle), MnCl2 (252 µg) alone, V2O5 (182 µg) alone, or a mixture of MnCl2 (252 µg) and V2O5 (182 µg) three times a week for up to one month. Following exposure, we performed behavioral, neurochemical, and histological studies. Our results revealed dramatic decreases in olfactory bulb (OB) weight and levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the treatment groups compared to the control group, with the Mn/V co-treatment group producing the most significant changes. Interestingly, increased levels of α-synuclein expression were observed in the substantia nigra (SN) of treated animals. Additionally, treatment groups exhibited locomotor deficits and olfactory dysfunction, with the co-treatment group producing the most severe deficits. The treatment groups exhibited increased levels of the oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonenal in the striatum and SN, as well as the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein PKCδ and accumulation of glomerular astroglia in the OB. The co-exposure of animals to Mn/V resulted in higher levels of these metals compared to other treatment groups. Taken together, our results suggest that co-exposure to Mn/V can adversely affect the olfactory and nigral systems. These results highlight the possible role of environmental metal mixtures in the etiology of Parkinsonism.",

      "abstract": "A burgeoning interest has recently focused on the development of nanomedicine to integrate noninvasive photothermal therapy (PTT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) for synergistic tumor treatments, owing to PTT's amplification effect on CDT. However, challenges emerge as hyperthermia often induces an unwarranted overexpression of cytoprotective heat shock proteins (HSPs), thereby curtailing PTT efficacy. Additionally, the nearly neutral tumor intracellular pH (pHi ≈ 7.2) that handicaps the Fenton reaction poses a leading limitation to CDT. Addressing these hurdles, we introduce EVP, a nanomedicine developed through the straightforward assembly of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), vanadium sulfate (VOSO4), and Pluronic F-127 (PF127). EVP comprehensively downregulates overexpressed HSPs (HSP 60, 70, 90) through the collaborative action of EGCG and vanadyl (VO2+). Moreover, the tumor intracellular pH-processed Fenton-like reaction by VO2+ ensures highly efficient hydroxyl radicals (OH) production in cytosols, overcoming the stringent acidity requirement for CDT. Additionally, the hyperthermia induced by PTT augments OH production, further enhancing CDT efficacy. In vitro and in vivo experiments validate EVP's excellent biocompatibility and potent tumor inhibition, highlighting its substantial potential in tumor therapy.",

      "abstract": "Agricultural lands with vanadium (V), pose a significant and widespread threat to crop production worldwide. The study was designed to explore the melatonin (ME) treatment in reducing the V-induced phytotoxicity in muskmelon. The muskmelon seedlings were grown hydroponically and subjected to V (40 mg L-1) stress and exogenously treated with ME (100 μmol L-1) to mitigate the V-induced toxicity. The results showed that V toxicity displayed a remarkably adverse effect on seedling growth and biomass, primarily by impeding root development, the photosynthesis system and the activities of antioxidants. Contrarily, the application of ME mitigated the V-induced growth damage and significantly improved root attributes, photosynthetic efficiency, leaf gas exchange parameters and mineral homeostasis by reducing V accumulation in leaves and roots. Additionally, a significant reduction in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) along with a decrease in electrolyte leakage was observed in muskmelon seedlings treated with ME under V-stress. This reduction was attributed to the enhancement in the activities of antioxidants in leaves/roots such as ascorbate (AsA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione S-transferase (GST) as compared to the V stressed plants. Moreover, ME also upregulated the chlorophyll biosynthesis and antioxidants genes expression in muskmelon. Given these findings, ME treatment exhibited a significant improvement in growth attributes, photosynthesis efficiency and the activities of antioxidants (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) by regulating their expression of genes against V-stress with considerable reduction in oxidative damage.",

Recently. adjuvant therapies, such as vanadium compounds, have gained attention due to their potential to improve glucose homeostasis in patients with diabetes. In order to determine the anti-diabetic and antioxidant effects of the oxidovanadium(IV) complex (Et3NH)2[{VO(OH}2)(ox)2(µ-ox)] or Vox2), rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes were treated with 30 and 100 mg/kg of Vox2, orally administered for 12 days. Vox2 at 100 mg/kg in association with insulin caused a 3.4 times decrease in blood glucose in STZ rats (424 mg/dL), reaching concentrations similar to those in the normoglycemic animals (126 mg/dL). Compared to insulin alone, the association with Vox2 caused an additional decrease in blood glucose of 39% and 65% at 30 and 100 mg/kg, respectively, and an increased pancreatic GSH levels 2.5 times. Vox2 alone did not cause gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea, and hepatic or renal toxicity and was not associated with changes in blood glucose level, lipid profile, or kidney or liver function. Our results highlight the potential of Vox2 in association with insulin in treating diabetes."

      "abstract": "One of the significant challenges of vanadium redox flow batteries is connected to the negative electrode where the main reaction of V(ii)/V(iii) and the side reaction of hydrogen evolution compete. To address this issue, we used titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene coating via drop-casting to introduce oxygen functional groups and metals on the carbon electrode surface. Characterization through scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the even distribution of Ti3C2Tx MXene on the electrodes and the presence of titanium and termination groups (-O, -Cl, and -F). The cyclic voltammetry analysis of MXene-coated electrodes showed more sharp electrochemical peaks for the V(ii)/V(iii) reaction than thermal-treated electrodes, even at relatively high scan rates. Notably, a relatively high reaction rate of 5.61 × 10-4 cm s-1 was achieved for the V(ii)/V(iii) reaction on MXene-coated electrodes, which shows the competitiveness of the method compared to thermal treatment (4.17 × 10-4 cm s-1). The flow battery tests, at a current density of 130 mA cm-2, using MXene-coated electrodes showed pretty stable discharge capacity for over 100 cycles. In addition, the voltage and energy efficiency were significantly higher than those of the system using untreated electrodes. Overall, this work highlights the potential application of MXene coating in carbon electrode treatment for vanadium redox flow batteries due to remarkable electrocatalytic activity and battery performance, providing a competitive method for thermal treatment."

The environmental benefits of wastewater treatment are extremely important to minimize pollutants. Here, the biochar purchased from the related industry was used to treat the wastewater which contained high concentration of vanadium (V). The concentration of vanadium was measured by the IC-OES and the results showed that 96.1% vanadium (V) was reduced at selected reaction conditions: the mass ratio of biochar to vanadium of 5.4, reaction temperature of 90 °C, reaction time at 60 min and concentration of H2SO4 of 10 g/L, respectively. Response surface methodology confirmed that all the experimental parameters had positive effect on the reduction of vanadium (V), which could improve the reduction efficiency of vanadium (V) as increased. The influence of each parameter on the reduction process followed the order: A (Concentration of H2SO4) > C (mass ratio of biochar to vanadium) > B (mass ratio of biochar to vanadium). Especially, the mass ratio of biochar to vanadium and concentration of H2SO4 had the greatest influence on the reduction process. This paper provides a versatile strategy for the treatment of wastewater containing vanadium (V) and shows a bright tomorrow for wastewater treatment."

However, strong controversy exists about the exact origin of these centers. This study systematically explores the influence of structural and functional groups on the vanadium redox reactions at carbon surfaces. Pyridine, phenol and butyl containing groups are attached to carbon felt electrodes. To establish a unique comparison between the model and real-world behavior, both non-activated and commercially used thermally activated felts serve as a substrate. Results reveal enhanced half-cell performance in non-activated felt with introduced hydrophilic functionalities. However, this cannot be transferred to the thermally activated felt. Beyond a decrease in electrochemical activity, a reduced long-term stability can be observed. This work indicates that thermal treatment generates active sites that surpass the effect of functional groups and are even impeded by their introduction."

      "abstract": "Industrial activities pose a significant ecological risk to water resources as they pollute surrounding waters with vanadium (V). Although the contribution of plants and substrates to V removal in constructed wetlands (CWs) has been reported, the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of AMF in V removal in CWs and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Reed plants (Phragmites australis) were inoculated with an AMF strain (Rhizophagus irregularis) in CW columns, creating AMF-inoculated (+AMF) and non-inoculated (-AMF) treatments. Three levels of influent V concentrations (low: 0.50 mg L-1, medium: 1.14 mg L-1 and high: 1.52 mg L-1) were examined. The + AMF treatment showed higher V removal (60%-98%) than the control (40%-82%) in all three conditions, although the difference was not significant in some cases. The mean mycorrhizal effects were 75%, 19%, and 28% for low, moderate, and high influent V concentrations, respectively. The +AMF treatment showed a higher GRSP-bonded V concentration (5.5 mg g-1) than the -AMF treatment (4.0 mg g-1). Furthermore, +AMF treatment showed larger plants with higher V concentrations in their tissues, accompanied by increased biological concentration factors and biological accumulation factors. Given the remarkable positive effect of AMF on V removal, our study suggests that treating AMF in CWs is a worthwhile approach.",

It poses potential adverse effects on animals and human health, with pronounced impact on lung physiology and functions. In this study, we investigated the metabolic response of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells to low-level V+5 exposure (0.01, 0.1, and 1 ppm) using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Exposure to V+5 caused extensive changes to cellular metabolism in BEAS-2B cells, including TCA cycle, glycolysis, fatty acids, amino acids, amino sugars, nucleotide sugar, sialic acid, vitamin D3, and drug metabolism, without causing cell death. Altered mitochondrial structure and function were observed with as low as 0.01 ppm (0.2 μM) V+5 exposure. In addition, decreased level of E-cadherin, the prototypical epithelial marker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), was observed following V+5 treatment, supporting potential toxicity of V+5 at low levels. Taken together, the present study shows that V+5 has adverse effects on mitochondria and the metabolome which may result in EMT activation in the absence of cell death. Furthermore, results suggest that high-resolution metabolomics could serve as a powerful tool to investigate metal toxicity at levels which do not cause cell death.",

Up to 80.7% diclofenac degradation was observed with a significant increment in reaction rate compared to commercially available Degussa P25 (kapp = 0.0013 → 0.0083 min-1) achieved within 3 h treatment time under optimized parameters of diclofenac concentration (10 mg L-1), catalyst loading (0.1 g L-1), and pH (5). The enhanced photocatalysis could be due to electron-hole separation and contribution of powerful oxidative species •OH > O2•-  > h+  >  > e-. The recyclability experiments indicate that 3%-BVT1 retained its efficiency up to 74.1% over five reaction cycles. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated the formation of several transformation products during the degradation pathway. The studies of interfering ions depicted mild interference by sulfates, while interference by phosphates and nitrates was negligible during photocatalytic process, i.e., 70, 78.01, and 78.43% for the selected concentrations of 50, 25, and 40 mg L-1 as per their maximum concentrations detected in the natural wastewaters.

The HEO calcined at 750 °C (HEO-750) demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity toward V3+/V2+ and VO2+/VO2+ redox couples compared to those of cells assembled with other samples. The charge-discharge tests further confirm that VRFBs using the HEO-750 catalyst demonstrate excellent Coulombic efficiency, voltage efficiency, and energy efficiency of 97.22, 87.47, and 85.04% at a current density of 80 mA cm-2 and 98.10, 74.76, and 73.34% at a higher current density of 160 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, with 500 charge-discharge cycles, there is no discernible degradation. These results are attributed to the calcination heat treatment, which induces the formation of a new single-phase fluorite structure, which facilitates the redox reactions of the vanadium redox couples. Furthermore, a high surface area, wettability, and plenty of oxygen vacancies can give more surface electroactive sites, improving the electrochemical performance, the charge transfer of the redox processes, and the stability of the VRFBs' electrode. This is the first report on the development of fluorite structure HEO nanoparticles in VRFBs, and it opens the door to further research into other HEOs."

The WZ-22-650 catalyst, containing a moderate W content (22%), demonstrated a high density of surface electroactive sites. Proper heat treatment facilitated the binding of oligomeric tungsten clusters to stabilized tetragonal ZrO2, resulting in improved catalytic performance toward the VO2+/VO2+ redox couples compared to other tested samples. The substantial surface area, mesoporous structure, and establishment of new W-O-Zr bonds affirm the firm anchoring of WOx to ZrO2. This robust attachment enhances surface electroactive sites, elevating the electrochemical performance of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). Charge-discharge tests further demonstrate that the superior voltage efficiency (VE) and energy efficiency (EE) for VRFBs using the WZ-22-650 catalyst are 87.76 and 83.94% at 80 mA cm-2, which are 13.42% VE and 10.88% EE better than heat-treated graphite felt, respectively.

      "abstract": "Repurposing drugs by uncovering new indications for approved drugs accelerates the process of establishing new treatments and reduces the high costs of drug discovery and development. Metal complexes with clinically approved drugs allow further opportunities in cancer therapy-many vanadium compounds have previously shown antitumor effects, which makes vanadium a suitable metal to complex with therapeutic drugs, potentially improving their efficacy in cancer treatment. In this review, covering the last 25 years of research in the field, we identified non-oncology-approved drugs suitable as ligands to obtain different vanadium complexes. Metformin-decavanadate, vanadium-bisphosphonates, vanadyl(IV) complexes with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and cetirizine and imidazole-based oxidovanadium(IV) complexes, each has a parent drug known to have different medicinal properties and therapeutic indications, and all showed potential as novel anticancer treatments. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms of action for these vanadium compounds against cancer are still not fully understood."

      "abstract": "Remediating vanadium (V) polluted soil has garnered widespread attention over the past decade. Yet, few research projects have investigated the stabilization of soil V using modified biochar, so the effects and interacting mechanisms between soil properties and modified biochar for V immobilization and stabilization remain unclear. Hence, this gap is addressed by determining the leaching behavior and mechanisms of soil V on different dosages of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) impregnated biochar (MLBC, 0.5%-4%). The applicability and durability in soil V immobilization was investigated under acid precipitation. The MLBC effect on V bioavailability and mobility was assessed first by CaCl2, Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) extractions in different periods. The V concentrations significantly reduced in CaCl2, TCLP, and SPLP extract with MLBC at each dosage (30 d), while slight to significant increase in SPLP and TCLP extract V was recorded in a long-term incubation (90 d). Column leaching test further demonstrated the high durability of 4% MLBC in V stabilization under continuous acid exposure. Compared to the control (no-biochar), the accumulated V content in the leaching solution significantly decreased in MLBC-amended soil. Acid soluble fraction of V showed significant negative correlation with both soil organic matter (SOM) and available P, which was positively correlated with pH, suggested that pH, available P and SOM were key factors affecting the bioavailability of V in soil. Moreover, combining with the characterization results of MLBC and amended soil, the results revealed that H3PO4 modified biochar played a vital role on V immobilization and soil improvement by forming electrostatic adsorption, ion exchange, redox reaction or complexation with the increase of functional groups. These revealed an efficient and steady development of soil quality and treatment for soil V contamination, under MLBC operation to soil polluted with exogenous V.",

      "abstract": "Vanadium is a prevalent neurotoxic transition metal with therapeutic potentials in some neurological conditions. Hydrocephalus poses a major clinical burden in neurological practice in Africa. Its primary treatment (shunting) has complications, including infection and blockage; alternative drug-based therapies are therefore necessary. This study investigates the function and cytoarchitecture of motor and cerebellar cortices in juvenile hydrocephalic mice following treatment with varying doses of vanadium. Fifty juvenile mice were allocated into five groups (n = 10 each): controls, hydrocephalus-only, low- (0.15 mg/kg), moderate- (0.3 mg/kg), and high- (3.0 mg/kg) dose vanadium groups. Hydrocephalus was induced by the intracisternal injection of kaolin and sodium metavanadate administered by intraperitoneal injection 72hourly for 28 days. Neurobehavioral tests: open field, hanging wire, and pole tests, were carried out to assess locomotion, muscular strength, and motor coordination, respectively. The cerebral motor and the cerebellar cortices were processed for cresyl violet staining and immunohistochemistry for neurons (NeuN) and astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein). Hydrocephalic mice exhibited body weight loss and behavioral deficits. Horizontal and vertical movements and latency to fall from hanging wire were significantly reduced, while latency to turn and descend the pole were prolonged in hydrocephalic mice, suggesting impaired motor ability; this was improved in vanadium-treated mice. Increased neuronal count, pyknotic cells, neurodegeneration and reactive astrogliosis were observed in the hydrocephalic mice. These were mostly mitigated in the vanadium-treated mice, except in the high-dose group where astrogliosis persisted. These results demonstrate a neuroprotective potential of vanadium administration in hydrocephalus. The molecular basis of these effects needs further exploration.",

While several compounds have shown promise in mitigating vanadium toxicity, their efficacy is limited. Effective strategies involve targeting specific subunits of the NMDA receptor, a glutamate receptor linked to neurodegenerative conditions. The potential neuroprotective effects of ZA-II-05, an NMDA receptor antagonist, against vanadium-induced neurotoxicity were explored in this study. Organotypic rat hippocampal slices, and live mice, were used as models to comprehensively evaluate the compound's impact. Targeted in vivo fluorescence analyses of the hippocampal slices using propidium iodide as a marker for cell death was utilized. The in vivo study involved five dams, each with eight pups, which were randomly assigned to five experimental groups (n = 8 pups). After administering treatments intraperitoneally over six months, various brain regions were assessed for neuropathologies using different immunohistochemical markers. High fluorescence intensity was observed in the hippocampal slices treated with vanadium, signifying cell death. Vanadium-exposed mice exhibited demyelination, microgliosis, and neuronal cell loss. Significantly, treatment with ZA-II-05 resulted in reduced cellular death in the rat hippocampal slices and preserved cellular integrity and morphological architecture in different anatomical regions, suggesting its potential in countering vanadium-induced neurotoxicity.",

This paper proposes a composition design of high-molybdenum-vanadium high-speed steel for rolls, and its specific chemical composition is as follows (wt.%): C2%, Mo7.0%, V7.0%, Si0.3%, Mn0.3%, Ni0.4%, Cr3.0%, and the rest of the iron. This design is characterized by the increase in molybdenum and vanadium in high-speed steel to replace traditional high-speed steel rolls with the tungsten element in order to reduce the heavy elements' tungsten-specific gravity segregation caused by centrifugal casting so that the roll performance is uniform and the stability of use is improved. JMatPro (version 7.0) simulation software is used for the composition design of high-molybdenum-vanadium high-speed steel. The phase composition diagram is analyzed under different temperatures. The content of different phases of the organization in different temperatures is also studied. The martensitic transformation temperature and different tempering temperatures with the different types of compounds and grain sizes are calculated. The process parameters of heat treatment of high-molybdenum-vanadium high-speed steel are optimized. The selection of carbon content and the temperature of M50 are calculated and optimized, and the results show that the range of pouring temperatures, quenching temperatures, annealing temperatures, and tempering temperatures are 1360~1410 °C, 1190~1200 °C, 818~838 °C, and 550~600 °C, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the samples obtained by using the above heat treatment parameters is consistent with the simulation results, which indicates that the simulation has important reference significance for guiding the actual production."

Catalytic reduction of ClO3- using palladium (Pd) nanoparticle catalysts exhibited sluggish kinetics. This work demonstrates an 18-fold activity enhancement by integrating earth-abundant vanadium (V) into the common Pd/C catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical studies indicated that VV and VIV precursors are reduced to VIII in the aqueous phase (rather than immobilized on the carbon support) by Pd-activated H2. The VIII/IV redox cycle is the predominant mechanism for the ClO3- reduction. Further reduction of chlorine intermediates to Cl- could proceed via VIII/IV and VIV/V redox cycles or direct reduction by Pd/C. To capture the potentially toxic V metal from the treated solution, we adjusted the pH from 3 to 8 after the reaction, which completely immobilized VIII onto Pd/C for catalyst recycling. The enhanced performance of reductive catalysis using a Group 5 metal adds to the diversity of transition metals (e.g., Cr, Mo, Re, Fe, and Ru in Groups 6-8) for water pollutant treatment via various unique mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are a promising technology for long-duration energy storage; but they suffer from inefficiencies in part due to the overvoltages at the electrode surface. In this work, more than 70 electrode treatments are reviewed that are previously shown to reduce the overvoltages and improve performance for vanadium RFBs (VRFBs), the most commercialized RFB technology. However, identifying treatments that improve performance the most and whether they are industrially implementable is challenging. This study attempts to address this challenge by comparing treatments under similar operating conditions and accounting for the treatment process complexity. The different treatments are compared at laboratory and industrial scale based on criteria for VRFB performance, treatment stability, economic feasibility, and ease of industrial implementation. Thermal, plasma, electrochemical oxidation, CO2 treatments, as well as Bi, Ag, and Cu catalysts loaded on electrodes are identified as the most promising for adoption in large scale VRFBs. The similarity in electrode treatments for aqueous-organic RFBs (AORFBs) and VRFBs is also identified. The need of standardization in RFBs testing along with fundamental studies to understand charge transfer reactions in redox active species used in RFBs moving forward is emphasized."

      "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and highly lethal lung disease that largely results from oxidative stress; however, effective antioxidant therapy by targeting oxidative stress pathogenesis is still lacking. The big challenge is to develop an ideal antioxidant material with superior antifibrotic effects. Herein, we report that V4C3 nanosheets (NSs) can serve as a potential antioxidant for treatment of pulmonary fibrosis by scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Interestingly, subtle autoxidation can adjust the valence composition of V4C3 NSs and significantly improve their antioxidant behavior. Valence engineering triggers multiple antioxidant mechanisms including electron transfer, H atom transfer, and enzyme-like catalysis, thus endowing V4C3 NSs with broad-spectrum, high-efficiency, and persistent antioxidant capacity. Benefiting from antioxidant properties and good biocompatibility, V4C3 NSs can significantly prevent myofibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix abnormality, thus alleviating the progression of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo by scavenging ROS, anti-inflammation, and rebuilding antioxidant defenses. This study not only provides an important strategy for designing excellent antioxidant nanomaterials, but also proposes a proof-of-concept demonstration for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and other oxidative stress-related diseases.",

Two related V(V) complexes, [VO(Hshed)(dtb)] (1) and [VO(Hshed)(cat)] (2), where H2shed = N-(salicylideneaminato)-N'-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine, H2dtb = 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol, and H2cat = 1,2-catechol, decomposed within minutes in cell culture medium at 310 K (t1/2 = 43 and 9 s for 1 and 2, respectively). Despite this, both complexes showed high antiproliferative activities in triple-negative human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells, but the mechanisms of their activities were radically different. Complex 1 formed noncovalent adducts with human serum albumin, rapidly entered cells via passive diffusion, and was nearly as active in a short-term treatment (IC50 = 1.9 ± 0.2 μM at 30 min) compared with a long-term treatment (IC50 = 1.3 ± 0.2 μM at 72 h). The activity of 1 decreased about 20-fold after its decomposition in cell culture medium for 30 min at 310 K. Complex 2 showed similar activities (IC50 ≈ 12 μM at 72 h) in both fresh and decomposed solutions and was inactive in a short-term treatment. The activity of 2 was mainly due to the reactions among V(V) decomposition products, free catechol, and O2 in cell culture medium. As a result, the activity of 1 was less sensitive than that of 2 to the effects of hypoxic conditions that are characteristic of solid tumors and to the presence of apo-transferrin that acts as a scavenger of V(V/IV) decomposition products in blood serum. In summary, complex 1, but not 2, is a suitable candidate for further development as an anticancer drug delivered via intratumoral injections. These results demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning the ligand properties for the optimization of biological activities of metal complexes.",

However, the molecular crosstalk between mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) and inflammation under V exposure is still at the exploratory stage. This study was conducted to determine the molecular crosstalk between MAMs and inflammation under V exposure in ducks. In this study, duck hepatocytes were treated with NaVO3 (0 μM, 100 μM, and 200 μM) and 2-aminoethyl diphenyl borate (2-APB) (IP3R inhibitor) alone or in combination for 24 h. The data showed that V exposure-induced cell vacuolization, enlarged intercellular space, and decreased density and viability. Meanwhile, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malonaldehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were upregulated under V treatment. In addition, excessive V could lead to a marked reduction in the MAMs structure, destruction of the membrane structure and overload of intracellular Ca2+ and mitochondrial Ca2+. Moreover, V treatment resulted in notable upregulation of the levels of MAMs-relevant factors (IP3R, Mfn2, Grp75, MCU, VDAC1) but downregulated the levels of IL-18, IL-1β, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the cell supernatant. Additionally, it also significantly elevated the levels of inflammation-relevant factors (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, MAVS, IL-18, IL-1β, and TXNIP). However, the inhibition of IP3R expression attenuated the V-induced variations in the above indicators. Collectively, our results revealed that the maintenance of calcium homeostasis could protect duck hepatocytes from V-induced inflammation injury via MAMs.",

      "abstract": "Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are promising energy storage systems with the potential to bridge the gap between intermittent renewable electricity generation and continuous supply of reliable electricity. The electrodes found in VRFB cells affect their energy efficiency (EE) and power density. It is important to fabricate electrodes with intriguing properties to enable VRFBs to have high performance. Herein, the abundant and cost-effective lignin is employed as the precursor to produce amorphous carbon particles after undergoing thermal decomposition treatment. The carbon particles cover the surface of carbon felt (CF). The resulting CF modified by lignin-derived carbon particles (Lignin-CF) with increased active sites and improved hydrophilicity displays superior electrochemical activity towards the VO2+/VO2+ pair than both the pristine CF and the heated bare CF. Remarkably, the VRFB consisting of Lignin-CF which acts as the positive electrode shows high performance in terms of the average EE (83.3 %) and average voltage efficiency (VE) (85.0 %) over 1000 cycles (long cycling life) for more than 16 days at 100 mA cm-2, and high power density of 1053.2 mW cm-2. It is noted that the EE and VE are comparable to the highest reported value of CF modified by carbon-based materials, aside having evidently longer cycling life. This study provides a feasible strategy for fabricating an affordable electrode for high-performance VRFBs."

      "abstract": "Vanadium is a strategic metal that has many important industrial applications and is generated by the use of burning fossil fuels, which inevitably leads to their release into the environment, mainly in the form of oxides. The wastes generated by their use represent a major health hazard. Furthermore, it has attracted attention because several genotoxicity studies have shown that some vanadium compounds can affect DNA; among the most studied compounds is vanadium pentoxide, but studies in vivo with oxidation states IV and III are scarce and controversial. In this study, the genotoxic and cytotoxic potential of vanadium oxides was investigated in mouse bone marrow cells using structural chromosomal aberration (SCA) and mitotic index (MI) test systems. Three groups were administered vanadium(IV) tetraoxide (V2O4) intraperitoneally at 4.7, 9.4 or 18.8 mg/kg, and three groups were administered vanadium(III) trioxide (V2O3) at 4.22, 8.46 or 16.93 mg/kg body weight. The control group was treated with sterile water, and the positive control group was treated with cadmium(II) chloride (CdCl2). After 24 h, all doses of vanadium compounds increased the percentage of cells with SCA and decreased the MI. Our results demonstrated that under the present experimental conditions and doses, treatment with V2O4 and V2O3 induces chromosomal aberrations and alters cell division in the bone marrow of mice.",

The preparation of pyrazinamide via catalytic hydration of 2-cyanopyrazine is of great economic interest with high atomic economy. Heterogeneous non-precious transition metal-catalyzed hydration of nitriles under neutral reaction conditions would be rather attractive. Herein vanadium-nitrogen-carbon materials were fabricated and employed for selective hydration of nitriles using water as both the solvent and reactant. 2-Cyanopyrazine could be smoothly converted into to pyrazinamide with unique substrate specificity. Additives with different N and O atoms could significantly affect hydration of 2-cyanopyrazine due to competitive adsorption/coordination in the reaction system. This work provides a new approach for non-precious metal catalyzed hydration of nitriles."

      "abstract": "Taking the significance of the special microenvironment for tumor cell survival into account, disrupting tumor redox homeostasis is highly prospective for improving therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a multifunctional 2D vanadium-based MXene nanoplatform, V4 C3 /atovaquone@bovine albumin (V4 C3 /ATO@BSA, abbreviated as VAB) has been elaborately constructed for ATO-enhanced nanozyme catalytic/photothermal therapy. The redox homeostasis within the tumor cells is eventually disrupted, showing a remarkable anti-tumor effect. The VAB nanoplatform with mixed vanadium valence states can induce a cascade of catalyzed reactions in the tumor microenvironment, generating plenty of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with effective glutathione consumption to amplify oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the stable and strong photothermal effect of VAB under near-infrared irradiation not only causes the necrosis of tumor cells, but also improves its peroxidase-like activity. In addition, the release of ATO can effectively alleviate endogenous oxygen consumption to limit triphosadenine formation and inhibit mitochondrial respiration. As a result, the expression of heat shock proteins is effectively suppressed to overcome thermoresistance and the production of ROS can be further promoted due to mitochondrial injury. Moreover, VAB also presents high photoacoustic and photothermal imaging performances. In brief, the multifunctional nanoplatform can provide ATO-enhanced nanozyme catalytic/photothermal therapy with broadening the biomedical applications of vanadium-based MXene.",

We investigated different electrode treatments mimicking the aging processes during operation, including thermal activation, aging, soaking, and storing. Several characterization techniques were used to deepen the understanding of the treatment of carbon felts. Synchrotron X-ray imaging, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with the distribution of relaxation times analysis, and dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) revealed differences between the wettability of felts. The bulk saturation after electrolyte injection into the carbon felts significantly differed from 8 % to 96 %. DVS revealed differences in the sorption/desorption behavior of carbon felt ranging from a slight change of 0.8 wt % to over 100 wt %. Additionally, the interactions between the water vapor and the sample change from type V to type H2. After treatment, morphology changes were observed by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Cyclic voltammetry and EIS were used to probe the electrochemical performance, revealing different catalytic activities and transport-related impedances for the treated samples. These investigations are crucial for understanding the effects of treatments on the performance and optimizing materials for long-term operation."

      "abstract": "Vanadium is a well-known essential trace element, which usually exists in oxidation states in the form of a vanadate cation intracellularly. The pharmacological study of vanadium began with the discovery of its unexpected inhibitory effect on ATPase. Thereafter, its protective effects on β cells and its ability in glucose metabolism regulation were observed from the vanadium compound, leading to the application of vanadium compounds in clinical trials for curing diabetes. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia disease in elderly people. However, there are still no efficient agents for treating AD safely to date. This is mainly because of the complexity of the pathology, which is characterized by senile plaques composed of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein in the parenchyma of the brain and the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are derived from the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the neurocyte, along with mitochondrial damage, and eventually the central nervous system (CNS) atrophy. AD was also illustrated as type-3 diabetes because of the observations of insulin deficiency and the high level of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as the impaired insulin signaling in the brain. In this review, we summarize the advances in applicating the vanadium compound to AD treatment in experimental research and point out the limitations of the current study using vanadium compounds in AD treatment. We hope this will help future studies in this field."

      "abstract": "The vanadium-based dehydrogenation (DH) catalyst is becoming a promise alternative to the industrial used Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, due to lower cost and less environmental threat. However, the low DH activity hampered the industrial application of vanadium-based catalysts. Herein, for the first time, we introduce a method to prepare high-efficiency vanadium-based catalyst by constructing pure V3+ species on γ-Al2O3 through treatment of as-prepared thiovanadate. The V3+ species contributes to not only enhancing the DH activity, but also fabricating the V3+-O/S acid-base pair with ideal strength and stability. The isobutene yield can reach as high as 56.9 wt%. Only Lewis acid is recognized on V3+/Al2O3 catalyst, while no Brønsted acid remains. The side-reactions are consequently inhibited, and the selectivity to isobutene is improved. Besides, with the increase of vanadium loadings, the Lewis acid content increases at first and then decreases, and the content of acid sites in middle strength keeps decreasing. Though the deposited coke on V3+/Al2O3 was just 2.5 wt% during 8.5 h consecutive DH reaction, the valence state of vanadium was still influenced and the fraction of inert V4+ species increased steadily. This study will improve the potential for industrial application of vanadium-based DH catalyst, and offer theoretical guidance for optimization of ideal DH catalysts."

      "abstract": "Bioactive inorganic nanomaterials and the biological effects of metal ions have attracted extensive attention in tumor therapy in recent years. Vanadium (V), as a typical bioactive metal element, regulates a variety of biological functions. However, its role in antitumor therapy remains to be revealed. Herein, biodegradable vanadium disulfide (VS2) nanosheets (NSs) were prepared as a responsive gas donor and bioactive V source for activating cancer immunotherapy in combination with immune-checkpoint blockade therapy. After PEGylation, VS2-PEG exhibited efficient glutathione (GSH) depletion and GSH-activated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) release. Exogenous H2S caused lysosome escape and reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis in tumor cells by interfering with the mitochondrial membrane potential and inducing acidosis. In addition, VS2-PEG degraded into high-valent vanadate, leading to Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition, potassium efflux, and interleukin (IL)-1β production. Together with further induction of ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death, a strong antitumor immune response was stimulated by reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the combined treatment of VS2-PEG and α-PD-1 amplified antitumor therapy, significantly suppressed tumor growth, and further elicited robust immunity to effectively defeat tumors. This work highlights the biological effects of vanadium for application in cancer treatment.",

Characterization by 1 H and 51 V NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopies confirmed that: 1) most complexes form two major geometric isomers in solution, and [VV O(SALIEP)(DTB)] (DTB=3,5-di-tert-butylcatecholato(2-)) forms two isomers that equilibrate in solution; and 2) tert-butyl substituents were necessary to stabilize the reduced VIV species (EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry). The pyridine moiety within the Schiff base ligands significantly changed their chemical properties with unsubstituted catecholate ligands compared with the parent HSHED (N-(salicylideneaminato)-N'-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine) Schiff base complexes. Immediate reduction to VIV occurred for the unsubstituted-catecholato VV complexes on dissolution in DMSO. By contrast, the pyridine moiety within the Schiff base significantly improved the hydrolytic stability of [VV O(SALIEP)(DTB)] compared with [VV O(HSHED)(DTB)]. [VV O(SALIEP)(DTB)] had moderate stability in cell culture media. There was significant cellular uptake of the intact complex by T98G (human glioblastoma) cells and very good anti-proliferative activity (IC50 6.7±0.9 μM, 72 h), which was approximately five times higher than for the non-cancerous human cell line, HFF-1 (IC50 34±10 μM).

X-ray diffraction was used to ensure glass and GCNs formation. Glasses and GCNs densities were measured by Archimedes principle. Fine polar clusters of lead titanate and/or barium titanate incorporation into vanadium borate glass matrix strongly depend on the composition. It was found out that the electrical conductivity of the initial glasses can be considerably improved by proper early stage of nanocrystallization at temperatures approaching the crystallization temperatures determined by DSC method. GCNs show massive increase in electrical conductivity (up to 6 orders of magnitude) as a function of BaTiO3 content. By increasing BaTiO3 content, the activation energy values have been found to increase. The enhancement in electrical conductivity of GCNs can be attributed to the increase in the crystalline phases in the glassy matrix which increases the concentrations of the V ion pairs."

Excess sodium metavanadate is a potential environmental toxin when consumed and could induce oxidative damage leading to various neurological disorders and Parkinsons-like diseases. This study is designed to investigate the impact of the flavonoid Glycoside Fraction of Ginkgo Biloba Extract (GBE) (at 30 mg/kg body weight) on vanadium-treated rats. Animals were divided randomly into four groups: Control (Ctrl, normal saline), Ginkgo Biloba (GIBI, 30mg/kg BWT), Vanadium (VANA, 10 mg/kg BWT) and Vanadium + Ginkgo biloba (VANA + GIBI). Markers of oxidative stress (Glutathione Peroxidase and Catalase) were assessed and found to be statistically increased with GIBI when compared with CTRL and treatment groups. Results from routine staining revealed that the control and GIBI group had a normal distribution of cells and a pronounced increase in cell count respectively compared to the VANA group. When compared to the VANA group, the NeuN photomicrographs revealed that the levels of GIBI were within the normal range (***p < 0.001; ** p < 001). The treatment with GIBI showed a better response by increasing the neuronal cells in the VANA+GIBI when compared with the VANA group. The NLRP3 Inflammasome photomicrographs denoted that there was a decrease in NLRP3-positive cells in the control and GIBI groups. The treatment group shows fewer cells compared to that of the VANA group. The treatment group shows fewer cells compared to that of the VANA group. The findings of the study confirmed that ginkgo biloba extract via its flavonoid glycoside fraction has favorable impacts in modulating vanadium-induced brain damage with the potential ability to lower antioxidant levels and reduce neuroinflammation."

      "abstract": "Due to the long-term open stockpile, the release of vanadium (V) from V-containing tailings will cause continuous V pollution in the mining area. Previous studies on the concentration and speciation of V primarily focused on surface tailings at a regional scale. However, the mobilization and redistribution of V within the tailing profile during the mineral transformation of tailings remain unclear. Herein, a series of concentrations of V(V) (0-200 mg L-1) solutions were added to the vanadium‑titanium magnetite tailings at different depths separately to simulate the redistribution of dissolved V released from tailings in the solid phase of tailings. During the 56-day incubation, the concentrations of aqueous V in the surface tailings were significantly lower than those in the deep tailings under the same level of V(V) treatment, indicating that the shallow tailings had a stronger immobilization capacity for V than the deep tailings. Morphological analysis and color overlays of the elements demonstrated that most of V was immobilized into the tailings and adsorbed or precipitated by the Fe (hydr)oxides in the tailings in 200 mg L-1 V(V) treatment. This portion of V mainly occurred in acid-soluble and reducible fractions in the tailings after a 7-day incubation, accounting for >71.7 % of the total V. However, these two factions of V with high bioavailability were gradually mineralized over time and transferred to residual V, which is difficult to move and has low bioavailability. Mineral phase analysis revealed that additional V(V) favored the formation of melanovanadite (Ca2V8O20·10H2O) and chromium vanadium oxide (Cr2V4O13) in the tailings. This study reveals that the dissolved V influenced the fractionation and redistribution of solid-phase V during tailing weathering, improving the understanding of the geochemical processes of V in tailing profiles and providing important guidance for the management of V-containing tailings."

      "abstract": "The fly ash (FA) from the combustion of heavy oil in power stations is characterized by fine particles containing toxic metals. The sample utilized in this study was gathered from the dust precipitators of seven heavy-oil-consuming Iranian power plants. Substantial quantities of heavy metals, particularly vanadium, iron, and nickel, have been detected in the sample, indicating both its potential utility and hazard to the soil and groundwater. The harmful consequences of FA disposal on the environment have led to the adoption of recycling as a treatment approach in this study. The valorization of FA was investigated by producing nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) through a novel approach using a combination of pyro-hydrometallurgical processes, which resulted in proposing a recycling closed-loop flowsheet. Roasting was first practiced to form NiFe2O4 by reacting the nickel and iron content of the FA. The NiFe2O4 showed a low dissolution against inorganic acids (H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3). The vanadium content of the FA showed a remarkable recovery in H2SO4 (91%) and HCl (95.6%), while the dissolution of Ni was limited to 16.85% and 17.5%, respectively. The produced NiFe2O4 acted well in response to the magnetic field, and its purity was further increased to 95-96% through a two-stage process consisting of grinding and magnetic separation. The nano-sized spherical NiFe2O4 with saturation magnetization of 34.66 and 30.82 emu. g-1 was obtained from H2SO4 and HCl residues, respectively. The dissolved vanadium was recovered as V2O5 via oxidation-precipitation in sulfate media and oxidation-ammonium precipitation in chloride solution. The purity of V2O5 in sulfate and chloride media was 93% and 98.5%, respectively. Finally, a life cycle assessment (LCA) study was performed on the suggested methods to track the ecological effects of extracting V and Ni from oil combustion FA. According to the performed LCA, H2SO4 was determined as the proper leaching reagent considering the environmental and technical aspects.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is one of the most tormenting global health burdens reporting high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) protein has elevated expression for most types of cancers, including prostate and breast cancer. Therefore, accurate and specific detection of MMP-2 biomarker is crucial for screening, treatment, and prognosis of related cancer. In this work, we have proposed a label-free electrochemical biosensor for the detection of MMP-2 protein. This biosensor was fabricated using hydrothermally synthesized vanadium disulfide (VS2) nanosheets with monoclonal anti-MMP2 antibodies biofunctionalized using a suitable linker. The VS2nanomaterials were synthesized hydrothermally at different reaction temperatures (140 °C, 160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C) generating different morphologies from a 3D bulk cubic structure at 140 °C to 2D nanosheets at 200 °C. Owing to the advantages of 2D VS2nanosheets with high surface-to-volume ratio, excellent electrochemical response and high antibody loading possibility, it was selected for fabricating an MMP-2 specific biosensor. The antibody-antigen binding event is analyzed by recording electrochemical impedance spectroscopy signals for different target MMP-2 protein concentrations. The sensitivity and lower limit of detection were 7.272 (ΔR/R)(ng ml)-1cm-2and 0.138 fg ml-1, respectively in 10 mM phosphate buffer saline for this proposed sensor. Further, interference studies were also performed which demonstrates the sensor to be highly selective against non-specific target proteins. This 2D VS2nanosheet-based electrochemical biosensor is a sensitive, cost-effective, accurate, and selective solution for cancer diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis activation has been considered a mighty weapon for cancer treatment, and growing attention is being paid to reinforcing tumor cells' sensitivity to ferroptosis. However, the existence of certain ferroptosis resistance mechanisms, especially the abnormal metabolism of tumor cells, has long been underestimated. We propose an enhanced ferroptosis-activating pattern via regulating tumor cells' glycometabolism and construct a nanoplatform named PMVL, which is composed of lonidamine (LND)-loaded tannic acid coordinated vanadium oxides with the camouflage of PD-L1 inhibiting peptide-modified tumor cell membrane. This work reveals that the mixed valence of vanadium (VIV and VV) in PMVL triggers ferroptosis due to the self-cyclic valence alteration of V, the process of which generates •OH for lipid peroxide accumulation (VIV → VV) and depletes glutathione (GSH) for glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) deactivation (VV → VIV). Notably, LND strengthens ferroptosis by dual suppression of glycolysis (decreasing ATP supply) and the pentose phosphate pathway (decreasing NADPH production), causing anabatic GSH consumption. Besides, the inhibited glycolysis generates less intracellular lactic acid and alleviates the acidity of tumor microenvironment, preventing immunosuppressive M2 macrophage polarization. In vitro and in vivo data demonstrate the glycometabolism-intervention-enhanced ferroptosis and boosted immunity activation, potentially providing opportunities and possibilities for synergetic cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) has been regarded as one of the best potential stationary electrochemical storage systems for its design flexibility, long cycle life, high efficiency, and high safety; it is usually utilized to resolve the fluctuations and intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. As one of the critical components of VRFBs to provide the reaction sites for redox couples, an ideal electrode should possess excellent chemical and electrochemical stability, conductivity, and a low price, as well as good reaction kinetics, hydrophilicity, and electrochemical activity, in order to satisfy the requirements for high-performance VRFBs. However, the most commonly used electrode material, a carbonous felt electrode, such as graphite felt (GF) or carbon felt (CF), suffers from relatively inferior kinetic reversibility and poor catalytic activity toward the V2+/V3+ and VO2+/VO2+ redox couples, limiting the operation of VRFBs at low current density. Therefore, modified carbon substrates have been extensively investigated to improve vanadium redox reactions. Here, we give a brief review of recent progress in the modification methods of carbonous felt electrodes, such as surface treatment, the deposition of low-cost metal oxides, the doping of nonmetal elements, and complexation with nanostructured carbon materials. Thus, we give new insights into the relationships between the structure and the electrochemical performance, and provide some perspectives for the future development of VRFBs. Through a comprehensive analysis, it is found that the increase in the surface area and active sites are two decisive factors that enhance the performance of carbonous felt electrodes. Based on the varied structural and electrochemical characterizations, the relationship between the surface nature and electrochemical activity, as well as the mechanism of the modified carbon felt electrodes, is also discussed."

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders, which are currently incurable diseases of the nervous system, are a constantly growing social concern. They are progressive and lead to gradual degeneration and/or death of nerve cells, resulting in cognitive deterioration or impaired motor functions. New therapies that would ensure better treatment results and contribute to a significant slowdown in the progression of neurodegenerative syndromes are constantly being sought. Vanadium (V), which is an element with a wide range of impacts on the mammalian organism, is at the forefront among the different metals studied for their potential therapeutic use. On the other hand, it is a well-known environmental and occupational pollutant and can exert adverse effects on human health. As a strong pro-oxidant, it can generate oxidative stress involved in neurodegeneration. Although the detrimental effects of vanadium on the CNS are relatively well recognized, the role of this metal in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders, at realistic exposure levels in humans, is not yet well characterized. Hence, the main goal of this review is to summarize data on the neurological side effects/neurobehavioral alterations in humans, in relation to vanadium exposure, with the focus on the levels of this metal in biological fluids/brain tissues of subjects with some neurodegenerative syndromes. Data collected in the present review indicate that vanadium cannot be excluded as a factor playing a pivotal role in the etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative illnesses, and point to the need for additional extensive epidemiological studies that will provide more evidence supporting the relationship between vanadium exposure and neurodegeneration in humans. Simultaneously, the reviewed data, clearly showing the environmental impact of vanadium on health, suggest that more attention should be paid to chronic diseases related to vanadium and to the assessment of the dose-response relationship.",

Germination-related parameters, mitotic index (MI), catalase (CAT) activity, chromosomal abnormalities (CAs), malondialdehyde (MDA) level, micronucleus (MN) frequency and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were investigated. The effects of VCI3 exposure on the DNA of meristem cells were investigated with the help of comet assay, and the relationships between physiological, cytogenetic and biochemical parameters were revealed by correlation and PCA analyses. A. cepa bulbs were germinated with different concentrations of VCI3 for 72 h. As a result, the maximum germination (100%), root elongation (10.4 cm) and weight gain (6.85 g) were determined in the control. VCI3 treatment caused significant decreases in all tested germination-related parameters compared to the control. The highest percentage of MI (8.62%) was also observed in the control. No CAs were found in the control, except for a few sticky chromosomes and unequal distribution of chromatin (p > 0.05). VCI3 treatment caused significant decreases in MI and increases in the frequencies of CAs and MN, depending on the dose. Similarly, the comet assay showed that DNA damage scores increased with increasing VCI3 doses. The lowest root MDA (6.50 µM/g) level and SOD (36.7 U/mg) and CAT (0.82 OD240nmmin/g) activities were also measured in the control. VCI3 treatment caused significant increases in root MDA levels and antioxidant enzyme activities. Besides, VCI3 treatment induced anatomical damages such as flattened cell nucleus, epidermis cell damage, binuclear cell, thickening in the cortex cell wall, giant cell nucleus, damages in cortex cell and unclear vascular tissue. All examined parameters showed significant negative or positive correlations with each other. PCA analysis confirmed the relations of investigated parameters and VCI3 exposure.",

In this work, we propose a tear-based MMP-9 antigen testing platform using hydrothermally synthesized vanadium disulfide nanowires. Also, various factors contributing to baseline drifts of the chemiresistive sensor including nanowire coverage on the interdigitated microelectrode of the sensor, sensor response duration, and effect of MMP-9 protein in different matrix solutions were identified. The drifts on the sensor baseline due to nanowire coverage on the sensor were corrected using substrate thermal treatment providing a more uniform distribution of nanowires on the electrode which brought the baseline drift to 18% (coefficient of variations, CV = 18%). This biosensor exhibited sub-femto level limits of detection (LODs) of 0.1344 fg/mL (0.4933 fmoL/l) and 0.2746 fg/mL (1.008 fmoL/l) in 10 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and artificial tear solution, respectively. For a practical tear MMP-9 detection, the proposed biosensor response was validated with multiplex ELISA using tear samples from five healthy controls which showed excellent precision. This label-free and non-invasive platform can serve as an efficient diagnostic tool for the early detection and monitoring of various ocular inflammatory diseases.",

Benefiting from the a-V2O5 amorphous characters, CNTs framework high conductivity and hierarchical microspheres with strong interface interaction, the a-V2O5@CNTs exhibited abundant active sites, fast reaction kinetics as well as eminent structure stability. As a promising electrode material, the a-V2O5@CNTs displayed high specific capacity (480 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), good rate capability and long-term stability under high current density (158 mAh g-1 at 30 A g-1 over 1000 cycles). Meanwhile, the corresponding mechanism was further illustrated through different characterizations. Furthermore, the as-assembled flexible pouch battery based on the a-V2O5@CNTs delivered outstanding flexibility and feasibility.

In this study, BiVO4 artificial nanozyme is developed with adjustable vanadium vacancy for ultrasound (US) enhanced piezoelectric/sonodynamic therapy. Under US excitation, the vanadium vacancy-rich BiVO4 nanosheets (abbreviated Vv -r BiVO4 NSs) facilitate the generation of a large number of electrons to improve the ROS yield. Meanwhile, the mechanical strain imposed by US irradiation makes the Vv -r BiVO4 NSs display a typical piezoelectric response, which tilts the conduction band to be more negative and the valance band more positive than the redox potentials of O2 /O2 •- and H2 O/·OH, boosting the efficiency of ROS generation. Both density functional theory calculations and experiments confirm that the introduction of cationic vacancy can improve the sonodynamic effect. As expected, Vv -r BiVO4 NSs have better peroxidase enzyme catalytic and glutathione depletion activities, resulting in increased intracellular oxidative stress. This triple amplification strategy of oxidative stress induced by US substantially inhibits the growth of cancer cells. The work may open an avenue to achieve a synergetic therapy by introducing cationic vacancy, broadening the biomedical use of piezoelectric materials.",

The presence of micro-alloying elements in HSLA steels induces the formation of microstructural constituents, capable to improve the mechanical performance of welded joints. Following double welding thermal cycle, with second peak temperature in the range between Ac1 and Ac3, the IC GC HAZ undergoes a strong loss of toughness and fatigue resistance, mainly caused by the formation of residual austenite (RA). The present study aims to investigate the behavior of IC GC HAZ of a S355 steel grade, with the addition of different vanadium contents. The influence of vanadium micro-alloying on the microstructural variation, RA fraction formation and precipitation state of samples subjected to thermal cycles experienced during double-pass welding was reported. Double-pass welding thermal cycles were reproduced by heat treatment using a dilatometer at five different maximum temperatures of the secondary peak in the inter-critical area, from 720 °C to 790 °C. Although after the heat treatment it appears that the addition of V favors the formation of residual austenite, the amount of residual austenite formed is not significant for inducing detrimental effects (from the EBSD analysis the values are always less than 0.6%). Moreover, the precipitation state for the variant with 0.1 wt.% of V (high content) showed the presence of vanadium rich precipitates with size smaller than 60 nm of which, more than 50% are smaller than 15 nm."

The values of yield strength and ductility of the V-Cr-Ta-Zr alloy were determined, depending on the stabilization and test temperatures. It was established that, after the combined treatment, the structural-phase state of the V-Cr-Ta-Zr alloy was composite, in which the joint implementation of dispersion and substructural strengthening ensured the formation of a gradient grain structure with a polygonal state, the elements of which were fixed by nanosized ZrO2 particles characterized by a high thermal stability. Such modification of the microstructure was accompanied by an increase in the high-temperature strength and a shift in the upper limit of the temperature stability interval towards high temperatures, of up to 900 °C. It was assumed that the polygonal state inside the grains contributed to the implementation of cooperative mechanisms of the dislocation-disclination type, which ensured the accommodation of the material in the \"high-strength state\" under loading."

      "abstract": "Calcination has been widely demonstrated as a favorable protocol for producing various inorganic nanomaterials for tumor therapy. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on the biotherapeutic efficacy of inorganic nanomaterials. Herein, we compare the effects of different calcination atmospheres on the therapeutic efficacy of Fe-V-O (FVO) nanomaterials. We find that compared with FVO nanomaterials synthesized by calcination in air, those prepared by argon calcination have a lower metallic valence state and a higher near-infrared light absorption capacity, hence resulting in significantly better biosafety and higher chemodynamic therapy (CDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT) efficacy. This study demonstrates that the therapeutic efficacy of inorganic nanomaterials can be optimized by employing different thermal treatment atmospheres, which provides new insights into the development of efficient anti-tumor agents.",

      "abstract": "Using tumors containing high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to design nanozymes is a new and effective strategy, and vanadium-based nanomaterials receive increasing attention. In this paper, four kinds of vanadium oxide nanozymes with different valences of vanadium are synthesized by a simple method to verify the effect of valence on enzyme activity. Vanadium oxide nanozyme-III (Vnps-III) with a low valence of vanadium (V4+) exhibits good peroxidase (POD) and oxidase (OXD) activities, which can effectively produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment for tumor treatment. In addition, Vnps-III can also consume glutathione (GSH) to reduce ROS consumption. Vanadium oxide nanozyme-I (Vnps-I) containing a high valence of vanadium (V5+) has catalase (CAT) activity, which can catalyze hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into oxygen (O2), which is beneficial to alleviate the hypoxic environment of solid tumors. Finally, a vanadium oxide nanozyme with both trienzyme simulation activity and GSH consumption ability was screened out by adjusting the ratio of V4+ to V5+ in vanadium oxide nanozymes. In cell and animal experiments, we successfully demonstrate that vanadium oxide nanozymes have excellent antitumor ability and high safety, which may bring great potential for clinical cancer treatment."

This study investigated bioleaching of smelting ash with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The vanadium-bearing smelting ash was first treated with 0.1 M acetate buffer and then leached in the culture of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. Comparison between one-step and two-step leaching process indicated that microbial metabolites could contribute to the bioleaching. The Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans demonstrated a high vanadium leaching potential, solubilizing 41.9% of vanadium from the smelting ash. The optimal leaching condition was determined, which was 1% pulp density, 10% inoculum volume, an initial pH of 1.8, and 3 Fe2+g/L. The compositional analysis showed that the fraction of reducible, oxidizable, and acid-soluble was transferred into the leaching liquor. Therefore, as the alternative to the chemical/physical process, an efficient bioleaching process was proposed to enhance the recovery of vanadium from the vanadium-bearing smelting ash.",

      "abstract": "The microbially- and chemically-mediated redox process is critical in controlling the fate of vanadium (V) in tailing environment. Although the microbial reduction of V has been widely studied, the coupled biotic reduction mediated by beneficiation reagents and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Herein, the reduction and redistribution of V in V-containing tailings and Fe/Mn oxide aggregates mediated by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and oxalic acid were explored. The dissolution of Fe-(hydr)oxides by oxalic acid promoted the microbe-mediated V release from solid-phase. After 48-day of reaction, the dissolved V concentrations in the bio-oxalic acid treatment reached maximum values of 1.72 ± 0.36 mg L-1 and 0.42 ± 0.15 mg L-1 in the tailing system and the aggregate system, respectively, significantly higher than those in control (0.63 ± 0.14 mg L-1 and 0.08 ± 0.02 mg L-1). As the electron donor, oxalic acid enhanced the electron transfer process of S. oneidensis MR-1 for V(V) reduction. The mineralogical characterization of final products indicates that S. oneidensis MR-1 and oxalic acid promoted solid-state conversion from V2O5 to NaV6O15. Collectively, this study demonstrates that microbe-mediated V release and redistribution in solid-phase were promoted by oxalic acid, suggesting that the role of organic agents for the V biogeochemical cycle in natural systems deserves greater attention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hydrocephalus is a neurological condition known to cause learning and memory disabilities due to its damaging effect on the hippocampal neurons, especially pyramidal neurons. Vanadium at low doses has been observed to improve learning and memory abilities in neurological disorders but it is uncertain whether such protection will be provided in hydrocephalus. We investigated the morphology of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and neurobehavior in vanadium-treated and control juvenile hydrocephalic mice. METHODS: Hydrocephalus was induced by intra-cisternal injection of sterile-kaolin into juvenile mice which were then allocated into 4 groups of 10 pups each, with one group serving as an untreated hydrocephalic control while others were treated with 0.15, 0.3 and 3 mg/kg i.p of vanadium compound respectively, starting 7 days post-induction for 28 days. Non-hydrocephalic sham controls (n = 10) were sham operated without any treatment. Mice were weighed before dosing and sacrifice. Y-maze, Morris Water Maze and Novel Object Recognition tests were carried out before the sacrifice, the brains harvested, and processed for Cresyl Violet and immunohistochemistry for neurons (NeuN) and astrocytes (GFAP). The pyramidal neurons of the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. Data were analyzed using GraphPad prism 8. RESULTS: Escape latencies of vanadium-treated groups were significantly shorter (45.30 ± 26.30 s, 46.50 ± 26.35 s, 42.99 ± 18.44 s) than untreated group (62.06 ± 24.02 s) suggesting improvements in learning abilities. Time spent in the correct quadrant was significantly shorter in the untreated group (21.19 ± 4.15 s) compared to control (34.15 ± 9.44 s) and 3 mg/kg vanadium-treated group (34.35 ± 9.74 s). Recognition index and mean % alternation were lowest in untreated group (p = 0.0431, p=0.0158) suggesting memory impairments, with insignificant improvements in vanadium-treated groups. NeuN immuno-stained CA1 revealed loss of apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells in untreated hydrocephalus group relative to control and a gradual reversal attempt in the vanadium-treated groups. Astrocytic activation (GFAP stain) in the untreated hydrocephalus group were attenuated in the vanadium-treated groups under the GFAP stain. Pyknotic index in CA1 pyramidal layer of untreated (18.82 ± 2.59) and 0.15mg/kg vanadium-treated groups (18.14 ± 5.92) were significantly higher than control (11.11 ± 0.93; p = 0.0205, p = 0.0373) while there was no significant difference in CA3 pyknotic index across all groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that vanadium has a dose-dependent protective effect on the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and on memory and spatial learning functions in juvenile hydrocephalic mice."

The objective of the current study was to examine the effect of vanadium-enriched yeast (VEY) supplementation on the gene expression level of insulin receptor substrates and clinical manifestations of obese type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) patients. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 44 obese T2DM patients were randomly allocated into either VEY (0.9 mg/day vanadium pentoxide) or placebo group for 12 weeks. The mRNA expression level of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFƘB) genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, serum levels of metabolic parameters, anthropometric indices, as well as the quality of life, and dietary intake were collected at pre- and post-intervention phases. Analysis of covariance was performed to obtain the corresponding effect size. Results showed that VEY administration significantly decreased anthropometric indices and glycemic parameters and increased insulin sensitivity after adjusting for potential covariates (p < 0.05), in comparison to the placebo group. Additionally, VEY supplementation was significantly effective on MAPK, PTP1B, and NFƘB gene expression level, compared to the placebo group. No significant changes were noticed for dietary intake, quality of life, and lipid profile in the VEY group, compared to the placebo group. Overall, VEY supplementation can be considered as a promising safe adjunct therapy for improving anthropometric indices and glycemic parameters in T2DM patients.",

      "abstract": "Globally, environmental concerns are rapidly growing due to increasing pollution levels. Vanadium is a hazardous heavy metal that poses health issues with an exposure concentration of about 2 ppm. It is regularly discharged by some industries and poses an environmental challenge. There are no sustainable green treatment methods for discharged effluents to mitigate vanadium threats to humans and the environment. In this study, the goal was to develop a green, sustainable method for removing vanadium and to utilize the produced biomass for biofuels, thus offsetting the treatment cost. Microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana SU1 and Picochlorum oklahomensis were employed for vanadium (III) treatment. The maximum removal was 25.5 mg L-1 with biomass and lipid yields of 3.0 g L-1 and 884.4 mg L-1 respectively after 14 days of treatment. The vanadium removal capacity by microalgae was further enhanced up to 2-2.7 folds while optimizing the key parameters, pH, and temperature before removing biomass from the liquid phase. FTIR is used to analyse the reactive groups in algal cell walls to confirm vanadium adsorption and to understand the dominant and quantitative interactions. Zeta potential analysis helps to find out the most suitable pH range to facilitate the ionic bonding of biomass and thus maximum vanadium adsorption. This study addresses regulating external factors for enhancing the removal performance during microalgal biomass harvesting, which significantly enhances the removal of vanadium (III) from the aqueous phase. This strategy aims to improve the removal efficiency of microalgal treatment at an industrial scale for the bioremediation of vanadium and other inorganic pollutants.",

      "abstract": "The long-term durability of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) depends on the stability and performance of the membrane separator. We have architected a hybrid membrane by uniform dispersion of MIL-101(Cr) (Cr-MOF) in a partially fluorinated polymer grafted with sulfonic acid groups (PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0)). The single cell VRFB performance of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane was studied in comparison with the Cr-MOF incorporated Nafion membrane (NafionCr-MOF(1.0)) and showed an excellent result with 97.5% Coulombic efficiency (CE) at 150 mA/cm2 without any significant deterioration in the charge-discharge process for 1500 cycles (over 650 h). Meanwhile, the CE value of the NafionCr-MOF membrane (94.5%) deteriorated after 800 cycles (about 360 h) under similar conditions. The high VRFB performance of the PHP@AMPSCr-MOF(1.0) membrane has been attributed to the synergized properties and good interactions between Cr-MOF and partially fluorinated polymer matrix responsible for the creation of hydrophilic proton-conducting channels to achieve high selectivity. Furthermore, the cost-effective polymer and thus membranes may open new windows for practical applications in other energy devices such as fuel cells, electrolysis, and water treatment."
