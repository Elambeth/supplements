      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To investigate the efficacy and safety of supplementation with a fixed combination of magnesium, vitamin B2, feverfew, andrographis paniculata and coenzyme Q10 in episodic migraine (EM) prevention. METHODS: A pilot, single-arm, open-label study was conducted. After a one-month baseline period, the above-described supplementation was introduced in 113 EM Greek patients, who were prospectively followed-up for three months. The primary endpoint was the change in monthly migraine days between baseline period (BSL) and the third month of supplementation (T3). Secondary endpoints included changes in mean intensity of migraine and in days with use of acute migraine medications. Changes in scores of Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire (MIDAS), Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), Migraine Therapy Assessment questionnaire (MTAQ), Migraine-Specific Quality-of-life questionnaire (MSQ-QOL), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were also evaluated. Those with ≥50% reduction in monthly migraine days at T3, compared to BSL were considered supplementation-responders. RESULTS: The mean number of migraine days was significantly decreased between BSL and T3 (9.4 ± 3.7 vs. 6.1 ± 3.5; p < 0.001). Likewise, days with peak headache intensity of >4/10 (5.7 ± 3.4 vs. 4.9 ± 3.1; p < 0.001) as well as days using acute headache medications per month (8.9 ± 3.6 vs. 5.7 ± 3.4; p < 0.001) were significantly reduced. At T3, 64 patients (56.6%) were classified as responders. The beneficial effect of supplementation was also associated with significant changes in HIT-6, MIDAS, MTAQ and MSQ-QOL scores. There were no safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The supplementation we have tested appears to be an effective and well-tolerated preventive approach against EM. A randomized, placebo-controlled study is needed to confirm our results."

Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) leaves have been traditionally used in the treatment of migraine with parthenolide being the main bioactive compound. However, due to similar flowers, feverfew is sometimes mistaken for the German chamomile (Matricaria recutita). Bisabolol and chamazulene are the main components in chamomile essential oil. Marigold (Calendula officinalis) was included in the study for comparison, as it belongs to the same family. Parthenolide was found to be present in all leaf extracts but was not detected in calendula flower extract. Chamazulene and bisabolol were found to be present in higher concentrations in chamomile and Calendula flowers. Apigenin was detected and quantified only in chamomile extracts (highest concentration in flower head extracts). Antioxidant activity in sample extracts was compared by superimposing the chromatograms obtained after post-chromatographic derivatization with DPPH and post-chromatographic derivatization with anisaldehyde. It was found that extracts from chamomile flower heads and leaves have the most prominent antioxidant activity, with bisabolol and chamazulene being the most effective antioxidants.",

METHODS: The proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC 7721 cells treated with feverfew lactone was measured by MTT assay. The autophagy of SMMC 7721 induced with feverfew lactone was assessed by acridine orange staining, autophagic marker LC3 and p62 detecting and autophagic flows analyzing. In addition, a role of ROS in this process was stated by treatment with antioxidant agent N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). RESULTS: The proliferation of SMMC 7721 cells were inhibited by feverfew lactone in a concentration dependence manner. The expression of LC3 and autophagic flows of SMMC 7721 cells were increased by feverfew lactone, while p62 was decreased, which implied that feverfew lactone could induce the autophagy of SMMC 7721 cells. Further more, the autophagy effect induced by feverfew lactone was declined obviously when treated with NAC suggested that ROS played an important role in this effect. CONCLUSION: Feverfew lactone induces autophagic death of SMMC 7721 cells by stimulating cells to produce ROS. The study will be helpful for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and to provide theoretical basis for the clinical application of feverfew lactone.",

With the aim to explore and develop new pharmacological treatments, we investigated the antihyperalgesic properties of St. John's Wort (SJW) and feverfew in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. Acute administration of a SJW seed extract reversed mechanical hyperalgesia with a prolonged effect. A SJW extract obtained from the aerial portion of the plant and a feverfew flower extract partially relieved neuropathic pain whereas a feverfew leaf extract was ineffective. The antihyperalgesic efficacy of these herbal drugs was comparable to that of clinically used antihyperalgesic drugs (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, l-acetyl-levocarnitine). Further examinations of SJW and feverfew composition revealed that hyperforin and hypericin might be responsible for the antihyperalgesic properties of SJW whereas the efficacy of feverfew seems to be related to the presence of parthenolide. Rats undergoing treatment with SJW and feverfew did not show any behavioral side effect or sign of altered locomotor activity. Our results suggest that SJW and feverfew extracts may become new therapeutic perspectives for painful DPN.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Environmental factors such as solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and other external aggressors provide an oxidative challenge that is detrimental to skin health. The levels of endogenous antioxidants decrease with age, thus resulting in less protection and a greater potential for skin damage. The NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) - antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway is a primary defense mechanism against oxidative stress, and induces the expression of antioxidant, detoxification and repair genes. Activation of ARE-Nrf2 can help restore oxidative homeostasis of the skin and play a role in inflammatory response and DNA repair mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of a purified parthenolide-depleted Feverfew (PD-Feverfew) extract on the ARE-Nrf2 pathway and DNA repair in skin cells. METHODS: These studies were undertaken in primary human keratinocytes or KB cells using Luciferase Promoter assay, siRNA transfection studies, Western blot analyses, Immunofluorescence microscopy, comet assay and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: PD-Feverfew was found to induce Nrf2 nuclear translocation and to increase ARE activity in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, knockdown of Nrf2 resulted in suppression of PD-Feverfew-induced ARE activity. PD-Feverfew was also found to induce phosphorylation of Akt, a kinase downstream of PI3K. Inhibition of PI3K via pre-treatment with the selective pharmacological inhibitor, LY294002, abolished PD-Feverfew-induced Nrf2/ARE activation. PD-Feverfew also reduced UV-induced DNA damage in a PI3K and Nrf2-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, by increasing endogenous defense mechanisms and aid in DNA repair of damaged skin cells via activation of a PI3K-dependent Nrf2/ARE pathway, PD-Feverfew may help protect the skin from numerous environmental aggressors.",

(Asteraceae) is a medicinal plant traditionally used for the treatment of fevers, migraine headaches, rheumatoid arthritis, stomach aches, toothaches, insect bites, infertility, and problems with menstruation and labor during childbirth. The feverfew herb has a long history of use in traditional and folk medicine, especially among Greek and early European herbalists. Feverfew has also been used for psoriasis, allergies, asthma, tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. The plant contains a large number of natural products, but the active principles probably include one or more of the sesquiterpene lactones known to be present, including parthenolide. Other potentially active constituents include flavonoid glycosides and pinenes. It has multiple pharmacologic properties, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, cardiotonic, antispasmodic, an emmenagogue, and as an enema for worms. In this review, we have explored the various dimensions of the feverfew plant and compiled its vast pharmacologic applications to comprehend and synthesize the subject of its potential image of multipurpose medicinal agent. The plant is widely cultivated to large regions of the world and its importance as a medicinal plant is growing substantially with increasing and stronger reports in support of its multifarious therapeutic uses."

Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide and TNF-α synthesis were quantified by ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression of iNOS and eNOS genes were analysed by RT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The feverfew extract inhibited both nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α production in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition of NO occurring at 5 µg/mL of feverfew extract. Both eNOS and iNOS mRNA levels were unchanged with the feverfew treatment. However, eNOS and iNOS proteins were significantly down-regulated by the feverfew extract. Feverfew inhibition of NO is due to the down-regulation of both eNOS and iNOS enzymes at the translational and/or post-translational level.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Therapeutic needs of migraineurs vary considerably from patient to patient and even attack to attack. Some attacks require high-end therapy, while other attacks have treatment needs that are less immediate. While triptans are considered the \"gold standard\" of migraine therapy, they do have limitations and many patients are seeking other therapeutic alternatives. In 2005, an open-label study of feverfew/ginger suggested efficacy for attacks of migraine treated early during the mild headache phase of the attack. METHODS/MATERIALS: In this multi-center pilot study, 60 patients treated 221 attacks of migraine with sublingual feverfew/ginger or placebo. All subjects met International Headache Society criteria for migraine with or without aura, experiencing 2-6 attacks of migraine per month within the previous 3 months. Subjects had <15 headache days per month and were not experiencing medication overuse headache. Inclusion required that subjects were able to identify a period of mild headache in at least 75% of attacks. Subjects were required to be able to distinguish migraine from non-migraine headache. Subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive either sublingual feverfew/ginger or a matching placebo and were instructed but not required to treat with study medication at the earliest recognition of migraine. RESULTS: Sixty subjects treated 208 evaluable attacks of migraine over a 1-month period; 45 subjects treated 163 attacks with sublingual feverfew/ginger and 15 subjects treated 58 attacks with a sublingual placebo preparation. Evaluable diaries were completed for 151 attacks of migraine in the population using feverfew/ginger and 57 attacks for those attacks treated with placebo. At 2 hours, 32% of subjects receiving active medication and 16% of subjects receiving placebo were pain-free (P= .02). At 2 hours, 63% of subjects receiving feverfew/ginger found pain relief (pain-free or mild headache) vs 39% for placebo (P= .002). Pain level differences on a 4-point pain scale for those receiving feverfew/ginger vs placebo were -0.24 vs -0.04 respectively (P= .006). Feverfew/ginger was generally well tolerated with oral numbness and nausea being the most frequently occurring adverse event. CONCLUSION: Sublingual feverfew/ginger appears safe and effective as a first-line abortive treatment for a population of migraineurs who frequently experience mild headache prior to the onset of moderate to severe headache.",

Parthenolide is the main sesquiterpene lactone in feverfew and has attracted attention because of its medicinal potential for treatment of migraine and cancer. In the present work the parthenolide content in different tissues and developmental stages of feverfew was analyzed to study the timing and localization of parthenolide biosynthesis. The strongest accumulating tissue was subsequently used to isolate sesquiterpene synthases with the goal to isolate the gene encoding the first dedicated step in parthenolide biosynthesis. This led to the isolation and charachterization of a germacrene A synthase (TpGAS) and an (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase (TpCarS). Transcript level patterns of both sesquiterpene synthases were analyzed in different tissues and glandular trichomes. Although TpGAS was expressed in all aerial tissues, the highest expression was observed in tissues that contain high concentrations of parthenolide and in flowers the highest expression was observed in the biosynthetically most active stages of flower development. The high expression of TpGAS in glandular trichomes which also contain the highest concentration of parthenolide, suggests that glandular trichomes are the secretory tissues where parthenolide biosynthesis and accumulation occur.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Few treatments are available that can safely and effectively stimulate new platelet production for thrombocytopenic patients. Additionally, recipients of transfused platelets may experience an inflammatory response due to stored platelets becoming unnecessarily activated, thus creating the need for suitable agents that will dampen undesirable platelet activation. We investigated the effect of the feverfew plant-derived compound, parthenolide on platelet production and platelet activation because of its well-studied ability to induce apoptosis or differentiation in some types of cancer. METHODS: Parthenolide was used to treat human megakaryoblastic cell lines, primary human and mouse megakaryocytes. Resulting platelet production and function was measured via flow cytometry. The two most common parthenolide signaling mechanisms, oxidative stress and nuclear factor-κB inhibition, were assessed within the megakaryocytes using reactive oxygen species, glutathione and luciferase reporter assays. The influence of parthenolide on ex vivo platelet activation was tested with parthenolide pretreatment followed by collagen or thrombin activation. The resulting P-selectin surface expression and released soluble CD40 ligand was measured. RESULTS: Parthenolide stimulates functional platelet production from human megakaryocyte cell lines, and from primary mouse and human megakaryocytes in vitro. Parthenolide enhances platelet production via inhibition of nuclear factor-κB signaling in megakaryocytes and is independent of the parthenolide-induced oxidative stress response. Additionally, parthenolide treatment of human peripheral blood platelets attenuated activation of stimulated platelets. CONCLUSION: Overall, these data reveal that parthenolide has strong potential as a candidate to enhance platelet production and to dampen undesirable platelet activation.",

      "abstract": "Metastatic melanoma is a highly life-threatening disease. The lack of response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy highlights the critical need for novel treatments. Parthenolide, an active component of feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), inhibits proliferation and kills various cancer cells mainly by inducing apoptosis. The aim of the study was to examine anticancer effects of parthenolide in melanoma cells in vitro. The cytotoxicity of parthenolide was tested in melanoma cell lines and melanocytes, as well as melanoma cells directly derived from a surgical excision. Adherent cell proliferation was measured by tetrazolium derivative reduction assay. Loss of the plasma membrane integrity, hypodiploid events, reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, and caspase-3 activity were assessed by flow cytometric analysis. Microscopy was used to observe morphological changes and cell detachment. Parthenolide reduced the number of viable adherent cells in melanoma cultures. Half maximal inhibitory concentration values around 4 mumol/l were determined. Cell death accompanied by mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase-3 activation was observed as the result of parthenolide application. Interestingly, the melanoma cells from vertical growth phase and melanocytes were less susceptible to parthenolide-induced cell death than metastatic cells when drug concentration was at least 6 mumol/l. Reactive oxygen species level was not significantly increased in melanoma cells. However, preincubation of parthenolide with the thiol nucleophile N-acetyl-cysteine protected melanoma cells from parthenolide-induced cell death suggesting the reaction with intracellular thiols as the mechanism responsible for parthenolide activity. In conclusion, the observed anticancer activity makes parthenolide an attractive drug candidate for further testing in melanoma therapy.",

Inflammation has recently been implicated in the genesis of many diseases including cancers, atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The mechanisms of action of feverfew in the human body are largely unknown. To determine the cellular targets of feverfew extracts, we have utilized oligo microarrays to study the gene expression profiles elicited by feverfew extracts in human monocytic THP-1 cells. We have identified 400 genes that are consistently regulated by feverfew extracts. Most of the genes are involved in cellular metabolism. However, the genes undergoing the highest degree of change by feverfew treatment are involved in other pathways including chemokine function, water homeostasis and heme-mediated signaling. Our results also suggest that feverfew extracts effectively reduce Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-mediated TNF-alpha and CCL2 (MCP-1) releases by THP-1 cells. We hypothesize that feverfew components mediate metabolism, cell migration and cytokine production in human monocytes/macrophages."

      "abstract": "The skin is under continual assault from a variety of damaging environmental factors such as ultraviolet irradiation and atmospheric pollutants, and as organisms age the cumulative damage exceeds the capacity of endogenous antioxidant defenses resulting in chronic inflammation and premature aging. Botanical extracts such as Feverfew containing naturally occurring antioxidants could replenish the depleted cutaneous stores and perhaps forestall these degenerative changes. A parthenolide-depleted extract of Feverfew (PD-Feverfew), which was free of sensitization potential, was found to possess free radical scavenging activity against a wide range of reactive oxygen species and with greater activity than Vitamin C. In vitro, PD-Feverfew restored cigarette smoke-mediated depletion of cellular thiols, attenuated the formation of UV-induced hydrogen peroxide and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release. In vivo, topical PD-Feverfew reduced UV-induced epidermal hyperplasia, DNA damage and apoptosis. In a clinical study PD-Feverfew treatment significantly reduced erythema versus placebo 24 h post-UV exposure. Through the ability to scavenge free radicals, preserve endogenous antioxidant levels, reduce DNA damage and induce DNA repair enzymes, which can help repair damaged DNA, parthenolide-depleted extract of Feverfew may protect skin from the numerous external aggressions encountered daily by the skin and reduce the damage to oxidatively challenged skin.",

An in vivo and in vitro preliminary screen was performed using a rat model: five female rats were orally dosed with 839 mg/kg feverfew daily on either gestation days (GD) 1-8 or 8-15. On GD20, rats were sacrificed and fetuses, placentae and ovaries were collected. The fetuses were weighed and examined for malformations. While maternal weight gain appeared to be reduced, ANCOVA analysis suggested that the difference was due to litter size, rather than treatment. Pre-implantation loss appeared increased but this was not statistically significant in the feverfew GD1-8 group. Fetuses exposed to feverfew from GD8-15 were smaller than ethanol controls perhaps as a result of the increased frequency of runts in treated litters. Feverfew induced toxicity when GD10.5 embryos were cultured for 26 h in rat serum to which extract was added. The results of the present preliminary study suggest that a comprehensive reproductive study of feverfew is warranted.",

Parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone, is considered to be the primary bioactive compound in feverfew having anti-migraine, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study we determined, through in vitro bioassays, the inhibitory activity of parthenolide and golden feverfew extract against two human breast cancer cell lines (Hs605T and MCF-7) and one human cervical cancer cell line (SiHa). Feverfew ethanolic extract inhibited the growth of all three types of cancer cells with a half-effective concentration (EC50) of 1.5 mg/mL against Hs605T, 2.1 mg/mL against MCF-7, and 0.6 mg/mL against SiHa. Among the tested constituents of feverfew (i.e., parthenolide, camphor, luteolin, and apigenin), parthenolide showed the highest inhibitory effect with an EC50 against Hs605T, MCF-7, and SiHa of 2.6 microg/mL, 2.8 microg/mL, and 2.7 microg/mL, respectively. Interactions between parthenolide and flavonoids (apigenin and luteolin) in feverfew extract also were investigated to elucidate possible synergistic or antagonistic effects. The results revealed that apigenin and luteolin might have moderate to weak synergistic effects with parthenolide on the inhibition of cancer cell growth of Hs605T, MCF-7, and SiHa.",

Studies have demonstrated improved pain-free response when prescription treatments are taken during the mild headache phase of a migraine. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of an OTC product, GelStat Migraine, when taken in the early, mild pain phase of migraine. MATERIAL/METHODS: An open-label study enrolling 30 subjects, male and female, with a one-year history of migraine meeting IHS diagnostic criteria with or without aura, 2-8 migraines per month and < or = 15 headache days per month. Inclusion required having migraines that consistently started at mild and worsened to moderate or severe, if untreated, in at least 75% of attacks. Subjects also had to be able to distinguish migraine from non-migraine headaches and reliably identify migraine early in the course of an attack. One headache was treated in the mild pain phase with GelStat Migraine, a combination of feverfew and ginger. RESULTS: 29 evaluable subjects completed the study, all treating at mild pain. Two hours after treatment, 48% were pain-free with 34% reporting a headache of only mild severity. 29% reported a recurrence within 24 hours. Side effects were minimal and not serious. 59% of subjects were satisfied with Gelstat Migraine therapy and 41% preferred GelStat Migraine or felt it was equal to their pre-study medication. CONCLUSIONS: GelStat Migraine is effective as a first line abortive treatment for migraine when initiated early during the mild headache phase.",

Despite their crucial role, standard chemotherapy often does not target these critical cells and, thus, the 'root' of leukaemic disease is not eradicated. To derive better therapies, unique molecular features of malignant stem cells have been characterised for AML and evaluated with regard to ablation of disease. In the course of such studies, the compound parthenolide, which is derived from the medicinal plant feverfew, has recently been shown to preferentially induce AML stem cells to undergo apoptosis. Importantly, parthenolide had no discernable effect on normal blood cells. Thus, this naturally occurring agent may provide new avenues of investigation for the treatment of leukaemia.

The primary objective was to show a dose-response of a new stable extract (MIG-99) reproducibly manufactured with supercritical CO2 from feverfew (T. parthenium). Furthermore, the study should provide data on the safety and tolerability of MIG-99. In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, controlled trial with an adaptive design, the clinical efficacy and safety of three dosages of MIG-99 (2.08 mg; 6.25 mg; 18.75 mg t.i.d.) were compared with placebo. The patients (n = 147) suffered from migraine with and without aura according to International Headache Society (IHS) criteria and were treated with one of the study medications for 12 weeks after a 4-week baseline period. The primary efficacy parameter was the number of migraine attacks during the last 28 days of the treatment period compared with baseline. Secondary endpoints were total and average duration and intensity of migraine attacks, mean duration of the single attack, number of days with accompanying migraine symptoms, number of days with inability to work due to migraine as well as type and amount of additionally taken medications for the treatment of migraine attacks. The design of the study included a pre-planned adaptive interim analysis for patients with at least four migraine attacks within the baseline period. With respect to the primary and secondary efficacy parameter, a statistically significant difference was not found between the overall and the confirmatory intention-to-treat (ITT) sample in the exploratorily analysed four treatment groups. The frequency of migraine attacks for the predefined confirmatory subgroup of patients (n = 49) with at least four migraine attacks during the baseline period decreased in a dose-dependent manner (P = 0.001). The highest absolute change of migraine attacks was observed under treatment with 6.25 mg t.i.d. (mean +/- SD = -1.8 +/- 1.5 per 28 days) compared with placebo (-0.3 +/- 1.9; P = 0.02). Overall, 52 of 147 (35%) patients reported at least one adverse event (AE). The incidence of AEs in the active treatment groups was similar to that in the placebo group, and no dose-related effect was observed in any safety parameter. MIG-99 failed to show a significant migraine prophylactic effect in general. Accordingly, in the ITT analysis a dose-response relationship could not be observed. MIG-99 was shown to be effective only in a small predefined subgroup of patients with at least four attacks during the 28-day baseline period where the most favourable benefit-risk ratio was observed with a dosage of three capsules of 6.25 mg MIG-99 extract per day. Because of the low number of patients, these findings need to be verified in a larger sample. The incidence of AEs was similar for all treatment groups.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biologically active natural products continue to be useful in the exploration and control of intracellular signaling processes. For example, the sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide from the anti-inflammatory medicinal herb Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) appears to inhibit the pro-inflammatory signaling pathway. Parthenolide's direct molecular target, however, remains unknown. We set out to identify the molecular mechanisms of parthenolide's anti-inflammatory activity. RESULTS: A parthenolide affinity reagent was synthesized and shown to bind directly to and inhibit IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), the kinase subunit known to play a critical role in cytokine-mediated signaling. Mutation of cysteine 179 in the activation loop of IKKbeta abolished sensitivity towards parthenolide. Moreover, we showed that parthenolide's in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity is mediated through the alpha-methylene gamma-lactone moiety shared by other sesquiterpene lactones. CONCLUSIONS: In recent years, the multi-subunit IKK complex has been shown to be responsible for cytokine-mediated stimulation of genes involved in inflammation and as such represents an attractive target for pharmaceutical intervention. Our finding that parthenolide targets this kinase complex provides a possible molecular basis for the anti-inflammatory properties of parthenolide. In addition, these results may be useful in the development of additional anti-inflammatory agents.",

Vogler et al., 1994 published positive results of prophylactic use of this herb in migraine. Since 1994 through 1996 we studied in our Centre of Migraine Therapy the efficacy of feverfew in migraine treatment. We had 24 patients (women 19-61 years old) in our group. The drug was administered once daily (5 ml of the sap) for 30-60 days. We observed significant reduction of Migraine Index in 8 patients, less significant in additional 5. Our results confirm that feverfew may be beneficial in migraine prophylaxis as an additive drug. Further controlled studies need to be done, especially to establish the optimal dose of the drug.",

AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to look at the evidence for or against the clinical effectiveness of feverfew in migraine prevention. DATA SOURCES: Literature searches were performed using the following databases: Medline, Embase, Biosis, CISCOM, and the Cochrane Library (all from their inception to April 1998). STUDY SELECTION: Only randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials were included. DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were read by two independent reviewers. Data were extracted in a predefined, standardized fashion. The methodological quality of all trials was evaluated using the Jadad score. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The majority favor feverfew over placebo. Yet important caveats exist. CONCLUSION: The clinical effectiveness of feverfew in the prevention of migraine has not been established beyond reasonable doubt.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of feverfew capsules on migraine prophylaxis was investigated in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in which 50 patients, who had not used feverfew before, participated. The capsules were filled with a dried alcoholic extract of feverfew on microcristalline cellulose and contained 0.5 mg parthenolide. The patients used one capsule (feverfew or placebo) a day. Fourty four patients completed the 9 month study. Both treatment groups suffered the same number of migraine attacks. A prophylactic effect could not be demonstrated for our feverfew preparation, but the patients seemed to have a tendency to use fever symptomatic drugs during the period they used feverfew. This result was not in accordance with the results from two other studies. The difference may be explained by the fact that both other studies included patients who previously reported positive experiences with feverfew preparations for migraine prophylaxis."

Forty one female patients with symptomatic rheumatoid arthritis received either dried chopped feverfew (70-86 mg) or placebo capsules once daily for six weeks. Allocation was random and not known by patient or observer. Variables assessed included stiffness, pain (visual analogue scale), grip strength, articular index, full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urea, creatinine, C reactive protein, complement breakdown products (C3dg), rheumatoid factor titre, immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM), functional capacity, and patient and observer global opinions. One patient (placebo) withdrew after three days and was not included in the analysis. Treatment and placebo groups (20 patients each) were well matched at entry. No important differences between the clinical or laboratory variables of the groups were observed during the six week period. This study therefore shows no apparent benefit from oral feverfew in rheumatoid arthritis.",

Frequency and severity of attacks were determined from diary cards which were issued every two months; efficacy of each treatment was also assessed by visual analogue scores. 60 patients completed the study and full information was available in 59. Treatment with feverfew was associated with a reduction in the mean number and severity of attacks in each two-month period, and in the degree of vomiting; duration of individual attacks was unaltered. Visual analogue scores also indicated a significant improvement with feverfew. There were no serious side-effects.",
