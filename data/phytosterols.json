      "abstract": "Phytosterols and phytostanols are two classes of sterol derivatives naturally synthesised in plants, but not in humans. Structurally, phytosterols and phytostanols have a sterane ring in common, but phytostanols do not have a double bond between carbons 5 and 6. The therapeutic potential of phytosterols and phytostanols supplementation in cholesterol reduction is the main reason for its wide usage in an expansive food matrix, including milk, yoghurt, margarine, mayonnaise, chocolate, tartare, chips, esterification with omega-3, and recently, as a successful nutraceutical among athletes is its fortification with whey protein. The heterogeneous effect of phytosterols and phytostanols in cholesterol lowering appears to be related to whether the individuals' inherent physiologic tendencies to \"hyper-synthesise\" cholesterol in the liver or \"hyperabsorb\" cholesterol via the small intestine. Individuals who are 'hypersynthesizers\" of cholesterol tend to have a good reduction in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) in response to statin therapy. Conversely, \"hyper-absorbers\" of cholesterol show a greater LDLc lowering in response to phytosterols or phytostanols. The ratios of cholestanol to cholesterol and lathosterol to cholesterol are good biomarkers of intestinal absorption of cholesterol and hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Animal data and human observational data suggest that phytosterols and phytostanols may have anti-atherosclerotic activities, e.g. reduction of the formation of nitric oxide, antagonism to the formation of LDL aggregates and plaque formation. The absence of cardiovascular outcome trials using phytosterol or phytostanol supplementation, makes it difficult to confirm a wider use in clinical practice, especially with the rapidly expanding list of effective and safe lipid-lowering medications.",

      "abstract": "Phytosterols are widely distributed in various plant foods, such as nuts, grains, vegetables, and so on. Phytosterols have been broadly applied in functional foods, supplements, and pharmaceutical products due to their excellent cholesterol-lowering effect. Besides the cholesterol-lowering effect, recently, phytosterols have been found to exert a beneficial effect on glycolipid metabolism, which contributes to multiple metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver. Constant development of new drugs with a single target fails to effectively curb the occurrence of metabolic diseases and complications, such as multiple organ damage, and phytosterols attract special attention due to varieties of biological activities, especially the regulation of glycolipid metabolism through multiple targets. Present review gives a comprehensive review of the effects of phytosterols on glycolipid metabolism and related mechanism. We also review the promising update of phytosterol in the treatment of two major metabolic diseases, including diabetes and nonalcohol fatty liver disease. This review can help to extend the understanding of the potential of phytosterols for mixed dyslipidemia and related metabolic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of phytosterols is a nutritional strategy employed to reduce cholesterol absorption, but recent research shows that their biological activity might go beyond cholesterol reduction for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and novel phytosterol formulations, such as submicron dispersions, could improve these effects. We explored the therapeutic activity of phytosterols, either formulated as submicron dispersions of phytosterols (SDPs) or conventional phytosterol esters (PEs), in a mouse model of MAFLD. MAFLD was induced in mice by atherogenic diet (AD) feeding. The reversion of distorted serum and liver parameter values after a period of AD feeding was investigated after supplementation of the AD with SDPs, PEs, or a placebo (PT). Additionally, the metabolic parameters of fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and inflammation were studied to understand the mechanism of action of phytosterols. AD supplementation with SDPs was shown to reduce liver fat, along with showing a significant improvement in liver triglycerides (TGs), free fatty acids (FFAs), and liver cholesterol levels. These results were reinforced by the analyses of the liver steatosis scores, and liver histologies, where SDP intervention showed a consistent improvement. Treatment with PEs showed slighter effects in the same analyses, and no effects were observed with the PT treatment. Additionally, SDP intervention reversed, with a higher efficacy than PEs, the effect of AD on the serum levels of TGs, total- and LDL-cholesterol levels, and glucose levels. And, exceptionally, while SDP improved HDL-cholesterol serum levels, PEs did not show any effect on this parameter. We provide evidence for the therapeutical activity of phytosterols in MAFLD beyond the regulation of cholesterol levels, which is increased when the phytosterols are formulated as submicron dispersions compared to ester formulations.",

Cold-pressed flaxseed, cold-pressed rapeseed, and refined rapeseed oils were treated with ozone, air, and nitrogen, then subjected to accelerated storage at 60 °C for 6 days. The sensory evaluation revealed that ozone significantly influenced the sensory profile, with notable cucumber and green-grassy aromas. Quantitation of odorants determined by headspace SPME-GC/MS and calculation of odor activity values (OAV) identified nonanal (citrus-like, soapy aroma, OAV 356), (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal (cucumber aroma, OAV 312), (Z)-3-hexenal (green grassy aroma, OAV 326), and hexanal (green grassy aroma, OAV 163) as major odorants. Furthermore, ozonation reduced total sterol content in refined rapeseed oil by 48 % during storage. While ozone did not form POP initially, they were produced during storage, with the most significant impact on rapeseed oil, doubling POP content compared to air and nitrogen treatments.",

      "abstract": "Background Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in elderly men, with a growing global incidence. Dietary supplements containing phytosterols (DS-PS) are increasingly used as complementary treatments for BPH. However, there is limited understanding of the knowledge and perceptions future healthcare professionals have regarding these supplements, which may affect the quality of medical counseling and patient care. Aim The present study aims to obtain a clear and detailed understanding of the level of knowledge and existing perceptions among medical students regarding DS-PS used in BPH. Materials and methods A structured questionnaire based on 18 questions was distributed to students from the medicine and pharmacy programs of the George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, and Technology of Târgu Mureș, Romania. Descriptive statistics was applied to all the questions, and potential associations were evaluated by the chi-square test. Results The study included 361 participants, predominantly female (54.61%) and aged between 18 and 25 years (82.06%). Although 80.43% of respondents were familiar with the concept of BPH, only 57.99% knew that phytosterols (PS) are used to improve the symptoms associated with BPH. A significant finding is that pharmacy students had a higher level of knowledge about DS-PS (79.77%) compared to medical students (54.49%). However, both groups show similar levels of general knowledge about BPH. Additionally, there was a significant association between the awareness of DS-PS and the perception of their safety, as well as between the level of knowledge about BPH and the understanding of the benefits offered by PS in the treatment of BPH (p<0.05). Conclusion This study shows a positive perception of PS among respondents, even in the absence of detailed knowledge, highlighting the need for integrative curricula for medical students and advanced training for healthcare professionals focused on the use of complementary phytotherapeutic approaches in chronic conditions. Integrating this information into university curricula and promoting evidence-based information could enhance clinical practice and patient counseling."

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of death globally. The primary risk factors are high blood lipid levels, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Phytosterols are naturally occurring plant bioactive substances. Short-term clinical trials have demonstrated phytosterols' cholesterol-lowering potential, but their effects on cardiovascular risk factors remain controversial, and relevant meta-analyses are limited and incomplete. We conducted a systematic and comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library up to December 22, 2023. A total of 109 randomized controlled trials (RCTS) of phytosterols (PS) intervention on cardiovascular risk factor outcomes were included in a preliminary screening of the retrieved literature by Endnote 20. We assessed the quality of all included randomized controlled trials using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool. Cochrane data conversion tool was used for data conversion, and finally Stata was used for meta-analysis, egger test and sensitivity analysis of the included studies. The results indicated that dietary phytosterols intake could significantly decrease total cholesterol (TC) level (mean difference = -13.41; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -15.19, -11.63, p < 0.001), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level (mean difference = -12.57; 95% CI: -13.87, -11.26, p < 0.001), triglycerides (TG) level (mean difference = -6.34; 95% CI: -9.43, -3.25, p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) level (mean difference = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.08, -0.01, p = 0.671), systolic blood pressure (SBP) level (mean difference = -2.10; 95% CI: -3.27, -0.9, p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) level (mean difference = -0.83; 95% CI: -0.58, -0.07, p = 0.032), increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level (mean difference = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.78, p = 0.005), but did not alter the levels of blood glucose (GLU) (mean difference = -0.44; 95% CI: -1.64, 0.76, p = 0.471), glycosylated hemoglobin, Type A1C (HbA1c) (mean difference = -0.28; 95% CI: -0.75, 0.20, p = 0.251), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (mean difference = 0.00; 95% CI: -0.02, 0.02, p = 0.980), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) (mean difference = 0.08; 95% CI: -0.08, 0.24, p = 0.335), oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OXLDL-C) (standard mean difference = 0.16; 95% CI: -0.38, 0.06, p = 0.154), body mass index (BMI) (mean difference = 0.01; 95% CI: -0.07, 0.09, p = 0.886), waist circumference (WC) (mean difference = -0.10; 95% CI: -0.50, 0.30, p = 0.625) and body weight (mean difference = 0.03; 95% CI: -0.18, 0.24, p = 0.787). Our results suggest that phytosterols may be beneficial in reducing the levels of TC, LDL-C, TG, CRP, SBP, and DBP, but have no significant effect on GLU, HbA1c, TNF-α, IL-6, OXLDL-C, BMI, WC, and Weight. However, there were a small number of RCTS included in this study and their small population size may have reduced the quality of the study. And most of the included studies were short-term intervention trials. Therefore, higher quality studies need to be designed in future studies to establish more accurate conclusions.",

      "abstract": "The global emergence of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) poses a formidable challenge to antibiotic therapy, as it confers resistance to a wide range of β-lactam antibiotics. This study aims to identify potential inhibitors of NDM-1 and thereby restore the effectiveness of the current antibiotics. Employing a comprehensive computational approach integrating molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a library of phytosterols was screened to identify promising candidates for inhibiting NDM-1 activity. Using the binding energy of meropenem, a frontline carbapenem antibiotic, as a reference, avenasterol, brassicasterol, and stigmasterol emerged as top phytosterol candidates for further investigation. Subsequent MD simulations confirmed the stability of NDM-1 complexes with avenasterol and stigmasterol over the simulation period, indicating their potential efficacy. These findings suggest that avenasterol and stigmasterol may effectively inhibit NDM-1 activity, warranting validation through in vitro and in vivo studies. Furthermore, these phytosterols hold promise as lead compounds for developing novel NDM-1 inhibitors. Their natural origin and potential inhibitory activity against NDM-1 offer compelling avenues for developing alternative antibacterial therapies to combat multidrug-resistant infections. This study underscores the utility of computational methods in drug discovery and highlights the potential of phytosterols as valuable candidates for addressing antibiotic resistance."

      "abstract": "Phytosterols are a large group of substances belonging to sterols-compounds naturally occurring in the tissues of plants, animals, and humans. The most well-known animal sterol is cholesterol. Among phytosterols, the most significant compounds are β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol. At present, they are mainly employed in functional food products designed to counteract cardiovascular disorders by lowering levels of 'bad' cholesterol, which stands as their most extensively studied purpose. It is currently understood that phytosterols may also alleviate conditions associated with the gastrointestinal system. Their beneficial pharmacological properties in relation to gastrointestinal tract include anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activity. Also, the anti-cancer properties as well as the impact on the gut microbiome could be a very interesting area of research, which might potentially lead to the discovery of their new application. This article provides consolidated knowledge on a new potential use of phytosterols, namely the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. The cited studies indicate high therapeutic efficacy in conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, IBD or liver failure caused by hepatotoxic xenobiotics, however, these are mainly in vitro or in vivo studies. Nevertheless, studies to date indicate their therapeutic potential as adjunctive treatments to conventional therapies, which often exhibit unsatisfactory efficacy or serious side effects. Unfortunately, at this point there is a lack of significant clinical study data to use phytosterols in clinical practice in this area."

      "abstract": "In recent years many women have looked for alternative therapies to address menopause. Hesperidin, phytosterols and curcumin are bioactive compounds that can ameliorate some cardiovascular risk factors associated with menopause, although there are no data concerning the effects of their combined supplementation. We used ovariectomized (OVX) rats, a postmenopausal model with oestrogen deficiency, to evaluate whether supplementation with a multi-ingredient (MI) including hesperidin, phytosterols and curcumin for 57 days would display beneficial effects against fat mass accretion and metabolic disturbances associated with menopause. Twenty OVX rats were orally supplemented with either MI (OVX-MI) or vehicle (OVX). Furthermore, 10 OVX rats orally received the vehicle along with subcutaneous injections of 17β-oestradiol biweekly (OVX-E2), whereas 10 rats were sham operated and received oral and injected vehicles (control group; SH). MI supplementation partly counteracted the fat mass accretion observed in OVX animals, which was evidenced by decreased total fat mass, adiposity index, the weight of retroperitoneal, inguinal and mesenteric white adipose tissue (MWAT) depots and MWAT adipocyte hypertrophy. These effects were accompanied by a significant decrease in the circulating levels of leptin and the mRNA levels of the fatty acid uptake-related genes Lpl and Cd36 in MWAT. These results were very similar to those observed in OVX-E2 animals. OVX-MI rats also displayed a higher lean body mass, lean/fat mass ratio, adiponectin-to-leptin ratio and insulin sensitivity than their OVX counterparts. Our findings can pave the way for using this MI formulation as an alternative therapy to manage obesity and to improve the cardiometabolic health of menopausal women.",

Phytosterols are key components of the phospholipid bilayer membrane and regulate various processes of plant growth and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, it was demonstrated that the overexpression of OsFes1A (Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor Fes1) increased phytosterols content and enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stress in Arabidopsis. In transgenic plants, the average content of campesterol was 17.6% higher than that of WT, and the average content of β-sitosterol reached 923.75 μg/g, with an increase of 1.33-fold. In fes1a seeds, the contents of campesterol and β-sitosterol reduced by 20% and 10.93%, respectively. In OsFes1A transgenic seeds, the contents of campesterol and β-sitosterol increased by 1.38-fold and 1.25-fold respectively. Furthermore, the germination rate of transgenic Arabidopsis was significantly higher than WT under stress (salt, ABA, and drought treatment). Under salt stress, transgenic plants accumulated a lower MDA content, higher chlorophyll content, and POD activity relative to the wild type, while the mutants showed the opposite pattern Our study found multiple other functions of OsFes1A beyond the defined role of Fes1 in regulating Hsp70, contributing to the better understanding of the essential roles of Fes1 in plants.

This study aimed to investigate the physiological response of broccoli leaves to these stresses, focusing on parameters such as growth, relative water content, stomatal conductance, and mineral concentration after 15 days of treatment application. The effects of individual and combined stresses of salinity and boron (deficiency and toxicity) were examined. Additionally, the study explored the molecular aspects of PIP aquaporins in relation to their presence in the plasma membrane and their interaction with the lipid environment. The results showed that the combined stress of salinity and boron deficiency resulted in a significant reduction in plant biomass, suggesting a specific adaptation to this stress combination. Changes in stomatal conductance and mineral nutrient levels indicated that the adaptation mechanisms were associated with water and boron concentration in the leaves. The expression patterns of PIP aquaporins varied among the different stress treatments, either individually or in combination. Furthermore, the presence of aquaporins in the plasma membrane and microsomal fraction highlighted the potential regulatory roles of trafficking along with the membrane composition, particularly the concentration of phytosterols. The results underscore the importance of water transport by aquaporins and their interaction with the sterol composition in the membranes, in facilitating salinity-boron stress adaptation mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Nuclear receptors (NRs) represent intracellular proteins that function as a signaling network of transcriptional factors to control genes in response to a variety of environmental, dietary, and hormonal stimulations or serve as orphan receptors lacking a recognized ligand. They also play an essential role in normal development, metabolism, cell growth, cell division, physiology, reproduction, and homeostasis and function as biological markers for tumor subclassification and as targets for hormone therapy. NRs, including steroid hormone receptors (SHRs), have been studied as tools to examine the fundamentals of transcriptional regulation within the development of mammals and human physiology, in addition to their links to disturbances. In this regard, it is widely recognized that aberrant NR signaling is responsible for the pathological growth of hormone-dependent tumors in response to SHRs dysregulation and consequently represents a potential therapeutic candidate in a range of diseases, as in the case of prostate cancer and breast cancer. On the other hand, phytosterols are a group of plant-derived compounds that act directly as ligands for NRs and have proven their efficacy in the management of diabetes, heart diseases, and cancers. However, these plants are not suggested in cases of hormone-dependent cancer since a certain group of plants contains molecules with a chemical structure similar to that of estrogens, which are known as phytoestrogens or estrogen-like compounds, such as lignans, coumestans, and isoflavones. Therefore, it remains an open and controversial debate regarding whether consuming a phytosterol-rich diet and adopting a vegetarian lifestyle like the Mediterranean diet may increase the risk of developing steroid hormone-dependent cancers by constitutively activating SHRs and thereby leading to tumor transformation. Overall, the purpose of this review is to better understand the relevant mechanistic pathways and explore epidemiological investigations in order to establish that phytosterols may contribute to the activation of NRs as cancer drivers in hormone-dependent cancers.",

METHODS: This was a pilot single-blinded, three-armed phase II randomized clinical trial, controlled with EPT. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to receive treatment for 3 months: (1) an oral herbal supplement of 1,500 mg/d (G1, n = 20), (2) an oral herbal supplement of 3,000 mg/d (G2, n = 20), or (3) conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate of 5 mg/d (EPT group, n = 20). The primary endpoint was the intensity of menopausal symptoms as measured using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (global and domain scores). The Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire uses a 7-point scale to rate the symptom intensity, with higher scores indicating severity. The secondary endpoints were hormonal, lipid, and safety profiles. RESULTS: Fifty-four participants (n = 54) completed the study. The mean, model-estimated, and global menopausal symptom scores at 3 months were 85.8 in the EPT group, 61.3 in G1, and 62.5 in G2. Participants treated with the herbal compound had lower global (13.7 [6.9-20.4], P < 0.001) and physical symptom scores (6.6 [1.6-11.5], P = 0.002) on the second month and lower psychosocial symptom scores (3.8 [1.3 to 6.3], P < 0.001) on the third month of follow-up, compared with EPT. Conversely, participants receiving EPT showed better outcomes on vasomotor symptoms since the first month of treatment (-6.1 [-8.3 to -4.0], P < 0.001). The EPT group exhibited higher values of estradiol and lower follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone since the first month of follow-up. Also, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly higher in this group than in G2. CONCLUSIONS: In this small single-blind exploratory trial, the oral herbal supplement was more efficacious in reducing global, physical, and psychosocial menopausal symptoms in the short term than EPT. However, further studies are needed to adequately assess the efficacy and safety of this herbal supplement in the treatment of menopausal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is increasingly prevalent worldwide, representing a major health burden. However, there is a lack of nutritional strategies for osteoporotic therapy. Phytosterols, as natural bioactive compounds, have the potential to alleviate osteoporosis. In this study, a glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis mouse model and treatment with low and high concentrations of phytosterols for 4 weeks were established. The results demonstrated that compared to the control group, low-concentration phytosterols (LP) (0.3 mg/mL) increased bone mass, improved trabecular microstructure, reduced serum levels of cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1), and elevated serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3). Conversely, high-concentration phytosterols (0.5 mg/mL) showed no effect. Additionally, we validated the effect of LP in ameliorating osteoporosis using an ovariectomized (OVX)-induced osteoporosis mouse model. Mechanistically, phytosterols altered the microbial composition to counteract glucocorticoid-induced gut microbiota disorder and improve the length and morphology of the small intestine. Particularly, based on selection strategy and correlation analysis, phytosterols increased the relative abundance of Ruminococcus and decreased the relative abundance of Bilophila, which were significantly associated with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis indications. Overall, these findings suggest that phytosterols regulate gut microbiota to increase bone mass, thereby exerting an antiosteoporotic effect."

Among other factors, the HDL lipidome is affected by diet. We hypothesized that diet supplementation with ω3 (docosahexaenoic acid: DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid: EPA) and phytosterols (PhyS) would improve the HDL lipid profile. Overweight subjects (n = 20) were enrolled in a two-arm longitudinal crossover study. Milk (250 mL/day), supplemented with either ω3 (EPA + DHA, 375 mg) or PhyS (1.6 g), was administered to the volunteers over two consecutive 28-day intervention periods, followed by HDL lipidomic analysis. The comprehensive lipid pattern revealed that the HDL lipidome is diet-dependent. ω3-milk supplementation produced more changes than PhyS, mainly in cholesteryl esters (CEs). After ω3-milk intake, levels of DHA and EPA within phosphatylcholines, triglycerides and CE lipids in HDLs increased (p < 0.05). The correlation between lipid species showed that lipid changes occur in a coordinated manner. Finally, our analysis revealed that the HDL lipidome is also sex-dependent. The HDL lipidome is affected by diet and sex, and the 4 weeks of ω3 supplementation induced HDL enrichment with EPA and DHA.",

      "abstract": "Cholesterol contributes to neuronal membrane integrity, supports membrane protein clustering and function, and facilitates proper signal transduction. Extensive evidence has shown that cholesterol imbalances in the central nervous system occur in aging and in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we characterize cholesterol homeostasis in the inner ear of young and aged mice as a new unexplored possibility for the prevention and treatment of hearing loss. Our results show that cholesterol levels in the inner ear are reduced during aging, an effect that is associated with an increased expression of the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), the main enzyme responsible for cholesterol turnover in the brain. In addition, we show that pharmacological activation of CYP46A1 with the antiretroviral drug efavirenz reduces the cholesterol content in outer hair cells (OHCs), leading to a decrease in prestin immunolabeling and resulting in an increase in the distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) thresholds. Moreover, dietary supplementation with phytosterols, plant sterols with structure and function similar to cholesterol, was able to rescue the effect of efavirenz administration on the auditory function. Altogether, our findings point towards the importance of cholesterol homeostasis in the inner ear as an innovative therapeutic strategy in preventing and/or delaying hearing loss.",

      "abstract": "The high blood level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Plant sterols, known as phytosterols (PSs), can reduce LDL-C in a range of 8-14%. The extent of LDL-C reduction depends on its formulation. Encapsulation into liposomes is one formulation strategy to enhance the efficiency of PSs. PSs (campesterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosterol) have frequently been assessed alone or in combination for their LDL-C-lowering ability. However, one naturally abundant PS, brassicasterol, has not yet been tested for its efficacy. We have previously developed a novel liposomal formulation containing the PS mixture present naturally in canola that is composed of brassicasterol, campesterol, and β-sitosterol. In this work, the efficacy of our novel liposomal PS formulation that includes brassicasterol was assessed in a hamster model. Animals were divided into five groups: (i) liposomal PS in orange juice, (ii) liposomal PS in water, (iii) marketed PS in orange juice, (iv) control orange juice, and (v) control water. The animals were fed a high-fat, cholesterol-supplemented (0.5%) diet to induce hypercholesterolemia. The treatment was administered orally once daily for 4 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, week 2, and week 4. The extent of the reduction of total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides was compared among the groups. Liposomal PSs in both orange juice and water significantly reduced LDL-C compared to their controls. Furthermore, the liposomal PS was as effective as a marketed PS-containing product in reducing LDL-C. Liposomal PSs in both orange juice and water showed similar efficacy in LDL-C reduction, highlighting that these vehicles/food matrices do not affect the efficacy of PSs. The liposomal formulation of a natural PS mixture extracted from canola oil, with brassicasterol as a major component, exhibited a significant LDL-C reduction in a hamster model.",

In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which PS regulates cholesterol metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD) mice. The results showed that PS treatment reduced the accumulation of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the serum of HFD mice, while increasing the serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Compared with HFD mice, PS not only increased the antioxidant activity of the liver but also regulated the mRNA expression levels of enzymes and receptors related to cholesterol metabolism. The hypolipidemic effect of PS was abolished by antibiotic (Abx) intervention and reproduced by fecal transplantation (FMT) intervention. The results of 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that PS modulated the gut microbiota of mice. PS reduced the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and other bile salt hydrolase- (BSH-) producing gut microbiota in HFD mice, which are potentially related to cholesterol metabolism. These findings partially explain the mechanisms by which PS regulates cholesterol metabolism. This implies that regulation of the gut microbiota would be a potential target for the treatment of HLP.",

Phytotherapeutic approaches have been developed over time owing to the adverse side effects of conventional medications such as 5-reductase inhibitors and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Therefore, dietary supplements (DS) containing active compounds that benefit BPH are widely available. Phytosterols (PSs) are well recognized for their role in maintaining blood cholesterol levels; however, their potential in BPH treatment remains unexplored. This review aims to provide a general overview of the available data regarding the clinical evidence and a good understanding of the detailed pharmacological roles of PSs-induced activities at a molecular level in BPH. Furthermore, we will explore the authenticity of PSs content in DS used by patients with BPH compared to the current legislation and appropriate analytical methods for tracking DS containing PSs. The results showed that PSs might be a useful pharmacological treatment option for men with mild to moderate BPH, but the lack of standardized extracts linked with the regulation of DS containing PSs and experimental evidence to elucidate the mechanisms of action limit the use of PSs in BPH. Moreover, the results suggest multiple research directions in this field."

Plant sterols have shown healthy properties beyond lowering LDL-cholesterol, including lowering triglycerides and lipoprotein plasma levels. Despite pre-clinical data suggesting their involvement in liver fat control, no clinical study has yet been successful. AIMS: Testing a sub-micron, free, phytosterol dispersion efficacy on NAFLD. METHODS: A prospective, uncontrolled pilot study was carried out on 26 patients with ≥17.4% liver steatosis quantified by magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects consumed daily a sub-micron dispersion providing 2 g of phytosterols. Liver fat, plasma lipids, lipoproteins, liver enzymes, glycemia, insulinemia, phytosterols, liposoluble vitamins and C-reactive protein were assessed at baseline and after one year of treatment. RESULTS: Liver steatosis relative change was -19%, and 27% of patients reduced liver fat by more than 30%. Statistically and clinically significant improvements in plasma triglycerides, HDL-C, VLDL and HDL particle number and C-reactive protein were obtained, despite the rise of aspartate aminotransferase, glycemia and insulinemia. Though phytosterol plasma levels were raised by >30%, no adverse effects were presented, and even vitamin D increased by 23%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are the first evidence in humans of the efficacy of submicron dispersible phytosterols for the treatment of liver steatosis, dyslipidemia and inflammatory status in NAFLD."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation are the key players in neuroinflammation, in which microglia dysfunction plays a central role. Previous studies suggest that argan oil attenuates oxidative stress, inflammation, and peroxisome dysfunction in mouse brains. In this study, we explored the effects of two major argan oil (AO) phytosterols, Schottenol (Schot) and Spinasterol (Spina), on oxidative stress, inflammation, and peroxisomal dysfunction in two murine microglial BV-2 cell lines, wild-ype (Wt) and Acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1)-deficient cells challenged with LPS treatment. Herein, we used an MTT test to reveal no cytotoxicity for both phytosterols with concentrations up to 5 µM. In the LPS-activated microglial cells, cotreatment with each of these phytosterols caused a significant decrease in intracellular ROS production and the NO level released in the culture medium. Additionally, Schot and Spina were able to attenuate the LPS-dependent strong induction of Il-1β and Tnf-α mRNA levels, as well as the iNos gene and protein expression in both Wt and Acox1-/- microglial cells. On the other hand, LPS treatment impacted both the peroxisomal antioxidant capacity and the fatty acid oxidation pathway. However, both Schot and Spina treatments enhanced ACOX1 activity in the Wt BV-2 cells and normalized the catalase activity in both Wt and Acox1-/- microglial cells. These data suggest that Schot and Spina can protect cells from oxidative stress and inflammation and their harmful consequences for peroxisomal functions and the homeostasis of microglial cells. Collectively, our work provides a compelling argument for the protective mechanisms of two major argan oil phytosterols against LPS-induced brain neuroinflammation."

It was also used as folk medicine for the treatment of anti-helminth, febrifuge, digestive tonic and wounds. In this study, eleven undescribed phytosterols (1-2, 4-12) and six known analogues (3, 13-17) were isolated from the stems of V. amygdalina. Their structures including absolute configurations were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic methods (1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS), X-ray diffraction and comparison of their ECD spectra. Besides, the tautomerism of phytosterols (1, 3-6, 12-17) with hemiacetal moiety were analyzed by solution NMR with different deuterated solvent and variable-temperature experiments. In addition, the cytotoxic activities of isolates against HeLa cells were evaluated. As a result, compound 10 exhibited the most potent anti-cervical cancer activity with the IC50 of 22.44 μM. Mechanism studies indicated that 10 triggered HeLa cells apoptosis through activating caspase signaling pathway. Furthermore, 10 could arrest the cell cycle in S phase and suppress the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to the inhibition of HeLa cells proliferation.",

This experiment aimed to evaluate the effects of feeding phytosterols on the community structures and metabolic functions of the rumen microbiota in perinatal cows. Perinatal cows were supplied with 0 mg (control) or 200 mg (treatment) phytosterols per day. Multiomic analyses were used to analyze the community structures and metabolic functions of rumen microbiota. Results showed that dietary phytosterols increased the copy number of total ruminal bacteria, the concentration of microbial crude protein, and the molar percentage of propionate in the rumen of perinatal cows but had no effects on the alpha diversity of ruminal bacteria. However, they enriched three genera (i.e., Fibrobacter) and seven species (i.e., Fibrobacter succinogenes) within active ruminal bacteria. Metatranscriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that dietary phytosterols enhanced the pathway of glycolysis and the family of glycoside hydrolase 13 but depressed the citrate cycle and pyruvate metabolism and several pathways of amino acid biosynthesis. In conclusion, dietary addition of phytosterols improved the growth of ruminal bacteria and changed rumen fermentation by modifying the rumen microbiome and the energy metabolism pathways, which would be beneficial for the energy utilization of perinatal cows. IMPORTANCE Perinatal cows suffer serious physiological stress and energy deficiency. Phytosterols have bioactive functions for gut microbes. However, little knowledge is available on their effects on rumen microbiota and rumen fermentation. Results of the present experiment revealed that dietary supplementation of phytosterols could improve the growth of ruminal bacteria and changed the rumen fermentation to provide more glycogenetic precursors for the perinatal cows by modifying the ruminal bacteria community and altering the energy metabolism pathways of the rumen microbiota. These findings suggest that dietary supplementation of phytosterols would be beneficial for perinatal cows suffering from a negative energy balance.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now recognized as the most common cause of chronic liver disease with an increasing prevalence in both adults and children. Although the symptoms are absent or poorly expressed in most cases, some patients may progress to end-stage liver disease. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is known to be multifactorial. Current therapeutic recommendations focus on lifestyle changes in order to reduce the incidence of risk factors and drugs targeting major molecular pathways potentially involved in the development of this disease. Given that a pharmacological treatment, completely safe and effective, is not currently known in recent years more research has been done on the effects that some bio-active natural compounds, derived from plants, have in preventing the onset and progression of NAFLD. Numerous studies, in animals and humans, have shown that phytosterols (PSs) play an important role in this pathology. Phytosterols are natural products that are found naturally in plant. More than 250 phytosterols have been identified, but the most common in the diet are stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, and campesterol. Consumption of dietary PSs can reduce serum cholesterol levels. Due to these properties, most studies have focused on their action on lipid metabolism and the evolution of NAFLD. PSs may reduce steatosis, cytotoxicity oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the importance of dietary phytosterols, which are a window of opportunity in the therapeutic management of NAFLD.",

In this study, two pre-treatment methods (alkaline hydrolysis and acid-alkali hydrolysis) were performed in parallel for the first time to investigate the effects on phytosterol analysis. The aim is to develop an analytical method for phytosterols in pollen and anther wall of tree peony (Paeonia ostii 'Fengdan') by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The result indicated that the contents of phytosterols in pollen (3390.02 mg/100 g DW) and anther wall (929.70 mg/100 g DW) of P. ostii 'Fengdan' were relatively high. Meanwhile, eleven phytosterols were identified, among which five phytosterols were first identified in tree peony pollen. Moreover, the effects of wall breaking and different developmental stages on phytosterol contents of pollen and anther wall of P. ostii 'Fengdan' were also discussed. The result showed that wall breaking was beneficial to sterol detection of pollen, but not necessary for anther wall. For the best harvest time, the stage of S2 had the highest content of phytosterols. In conclusion, this study successfully establishes an analytical method for phytosterols by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and lays a foundation for the development and utilization of pollen and anther wall of P. ostii 'Fengdan' in functional foods and pharmaceutical industry.",

However, those edible particles are mostly used for stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions, whereas those for water-in-oil emulsions are very limited. In this article, stable water-in-oil Pickering emulsions were prepared through dispersing phytosterol particles in oil phase, and the effects of antisolvent treatment, the type of oil, particle concentration, and water fraction on the stability, type, and morphology of these emulsions were investigated. In addition, the release profile of salt as a model aqueous compound from these emulsions has also been studied. Results showed that due to its higher water content, the antisolvent pretreatment of phytosterol in the ethanol/water system facilitated the dispersion of dried phytosterol particles into oil phase as microcrystals. Water-in-oil Pickering emulsions with droplet sizes of 80-100 μm were fabricated at phytosterol concentrations of 1.5-3% w/v and water fractions of 0.2-0.6. The dissolved phytosterol molecules in oil phase could help in emulsion stabilization through interfacial crystallization during emulsification, evidenced by polar microscopic observations. Moreover, the salt release from phytosterol-stabilized Pickering emulsions showed a temperature-dependent profile which could have potential application in a controlled-release system. The current study provided important information for fabrication of stable water-in-oil emulsion using natural particles.",

METHOD: The authors studied 38 non-obese volunteers (58±12 years; Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ‒ LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL) randomly assigned to consume 400 mL/day of soy milk (Control phase) or soy milk + PS (1.6 g/day) for four weeks in a double-blind, cross-over study. PS and lathosterol were measured in plasma by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrophotometry. RESULTS: PS treatment reduced plasma total cholesterol concentration (-5.5%, p < 0.001), LDL-C (-7.6%, p < 0.001), triglycerides (-13.6%, p < 0.0085), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) (-6.3%, p < 0.008), without changing high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C concentration), but plasma lathosterol, campesterol and sitosterol expressed per plasma cholesterol increased. CONCLUSIONS: The lathosterol-to-cholesterol plasma ratio predicted the plasma cholesterol response to PS feeding. The highest plasma lathosterol concentration during the control phase was associated with a lack of response of plasma cholesterol during the PS treatment period. Consequently, cholesterol synthesis in non-responders to dietary PS being elevated in the control phase indicates these cases resist to further synthesis rise, whereas responders to dietary PS, having in the control phase synthesis values lower than non-responders, expand synthesis on alimentary PS. Responders absorb more PS than non-responders, likely resulting from responders delivering into the intestinal lumen less endogenous cholesterol than non-responders do, thus facilitating greater intestinal absorption of PS shown as increased plasma PS concentration.",

However, its active components and mechanism have remained to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to investigate the active components of pumpkin seed oil and its mechanism against BPH. DESIGN: Total phytosterol (TPS) was isolated from hull-less pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L. var. Styriaca) seed oil and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Three phytosterols were purified by preparative HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) and confirmed by NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance). TPS (3.3 mg/kg body weight, 1 mL/day/rat) was administered intragastrically to the testosterone propionate-induced BPH rats for 4 weeks. The structure changes of prostate tissues were assessed by hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) and steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, while that of 5α-reductase (5AR), apoptosis, or proliferation-related growth factors/proteins was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blotting. RESULTS: The ∆7-phytosterols in TPS reached up to 87.64%. Among them, 24β-ethylcholesta-7,22,25-trienol, 24β-ethylcholesta-7,25(27)-dien-3-ol, and ∆7-avenasterol were confirmed by NMR. TPS treatment significantly ameliorated the pathological prostate enlargement and restored histopathological alterations of prostate in BPH rats. It effectively suppressed the expressions of 5AR, AR, and coactivator SRC-1. TPS inhibited the expression of proliferation-related growth factor epidermal growth factor, whereas it increased the expressions of apoptosis-related growth factor/gene transforming growth factor-β1. The proliferation-inhibiting effect was achieved by decreasing the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation, while apoptosis was induced by Caspase 3 activation through JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: TPS from hull-less pumpkin seed oil, with ∆7-phytosterols as its main ingredients, is a potential nutraceutical for BPH prevention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Steroid drugs are essential for disease prevention and clinical treatment. However, due to intricated steroid structure, traditional chemical methods are rarely implemented into the whole synthetic process for generating steroid intermediates. Novel steroid drug precursors and their ideal bacterial strains for industrial production have yet to be developed. Among these, 9,21-dihydroxy-20-methyl-pregna-4-en-3-one (9-OH-4-HP) is a novel steroid drug precursor, suitable for the synthesis of corticosteroids. In this study, a combined strategy of blocking Δ1-dehydrogenation and the C19 pathway as well as improving the intracellular environment was investigated to construct an effective 9-OH-4-HP-producing strain. RESULTS: The Δ1-dehydrogenation-deficient strain of wild-type Mycobacterium neoaurum DSM 44074 produces 9-OH-4-HP with a molar yield of 4.8%. Hsd4A, encoding a β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and fadA5, encoding an acyl-CoA thiolase, were separately knocked out to block the C19 pathway in the Δ1-dehydrogenation-deficient strain. The two engineered strains were able to accumulate 0.59 g L-1 and 0.47 g L-1 9-OH-4-HP from 1 g L-1 phytosterols, respectively. Furthermore, hsd4A and fadA5 were knocked out simultaneously in the Δ1-dehydrogenation-deficient strain. The 9-OH-4-HP production from the Hsd4A and FadA5 deficient strain was 11.9% higher than that of the Hsd4A deficient strain and 40.4% higher than that of the strain with FadA5 deficiency strain, respectively. The purity of 9-OH-4-HP obtained from the Hsd4A and FadA5 deficient strain has reached 94.9%. Subsequently, the catalase katE from Mycobacterium neoaurum and an NADH oxidase, nox, from Bacillus subtilis were overexpressed to improve the intracellular environment, leading to a higher 9-OH-4-HP production. Ultimately, 9-OH-4-HP production reached 3.58 g L-1 from 5 g L-1 phytosterols, and the purity of 9-OH-4-HP improved to 97%. The final 9-OH-4-HP production strain showed the best molar yield of 85.5%, compared with the previous reported strain with 30% molar yield of 9-OH-4-HP. CONCLUSION: KstD, Hsd4A, and FadA5 are key enzymes for phytosterol side-chain degradation in the C19 pathway. Double deletion of hsd4A and fadA5 contributes to the blockage of the C19 pathway. Improving the intracellular environment of Mycobacterium neoaurum during phytosterol bioconversion could accelerate the conversion process and enhance the productivity of target sterol derivatives.",

Morus alba fruit is a well-known edible fruit commonly used in traditional folk medicine. Chemical investigation of M. alba fruit resulted in the isolation and identification of six phytosterols (1-6). Their structures were determined as 7-ketositosterol (1), stigmast-4-en-3β-ol-6-one (2), (3β,6α)-stigmast-4-ene-3,6-diol (3), stigmast-4-ene-3β,6β-diol (4), 7β-hydroxysitosterol 3-O-β-d-glucoside (5), and 7α-hydroxysitosterol 3-O-β-d-glucoside (6) by analyzing their physical and spectroscopic data as well as liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry data. All compounds displayed protective effects against cisplatin-induced LLC-PK1 cell damage, improving cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity to more than 80% of the control value. Compound 1 displayed the best effect at a relatively low concentration by inhibiting the percentage of apoptotic cells following cisplatin treatment. Its molecular mechanisms were identified using Western blot assays. Treatment of LLC-PK1 cells with compound 1 decreased the upregulated phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) following cisplatin treatment. In addition, compound 1 significantly suppressed cleaved caspase-3 in cisplatin-induced LLC-PK1 cells. Taken together, these findings indicated that cisplatin-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by compound 1 in LLC-PK1 cells, thereby supporting the potential of 7-ketositosterol (1) as an adjuvant candidate for treating cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity."

Elevated blood cholesterol levels are not only the major but also the best modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Lifestyle modifications which include a healthy diet are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy. So-called functional foods supplemented with plant sterols lower blood cholesterol levels by about 10-15%. RECENT FINDINGS: In the recent revision of the ESC/EAS dyslipidemia guideline 2019, plant sterols are recommended for the first time as an adjunct to lifestyle modification to lower blood cholesterol levels. However, the German Cardiac Society (DGK) is more critical of food supplementation with plant sterols and calls for randomized controlled trials investigating hard cardiovascular outcomes. An increasing body of evidence suggests that plant sterols per se are atherogenic. This review discusses this controversy based on findings from in vitro and in vivo studies, clinical trials, and genetic evidence.",

      "abstract": "The use of phytosterols (or plant sterols) for the control of plasma cholesterol concentrations has recently gained traction because their efficacy is acknowledged by scientific authorities and leading guidelines. Phytosterols, marketed as supplements or functional foods, are formally classified as food in the European Union, are freely available for purchase, and are frequently used without any health professional advice; therefore, they are often self-prescribed, either inappropriately or in situations in which no significant advantage can be obtained. For this reason, a panel of experts with diverse medical and scientific backgrounds was convened by NFI-Nutrition Foundation of Italy-to critically evaluate and summarize the literature available on the topic, with the goal of providing medical doctors and all health professionals useful information to actively govern the use of phytosterols in the context of plasma cholesterol control. Some practical indications to help professionals identify subjects who will most likely benefit from the use of these products, optimizing the therapeutic outcomes, are also provided. The panel concluded that the use of phytosterols as supplements or functional foods to control Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels should be preceded by the assessment of some relevant individual characteristics: cardiovascular risk, lipid profile, correct understanding of how to use these products, and willingness to pay for the treatment.",

METHODS: This was a phase-I, randomized parallel three arms, double-blinded, and a placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 55 participants aged 18-40 were randomly assigned to one of three groups to receive for three months: (1) an oral herbal supplement of 1650 mg/day; (2) an oral herbal supplement of 3300 mg/day; or (3) an oral placebo 3300 mg/day. The primary endpoints were oral safety and tolerability of the supplement. The secondary endpoint was its effect on vital functions, anthropometrics, and laboratory tests. We used an exploratory approach by covariance analysis (ANCOVA) adjusted for the variables' baseline value for the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: All women completed three months of follow-up, reporting no side effects. Our exploratory analysis revealed that treatment with the herbal supplement of 1650 mg/day was associated with increased glucose and uric acid levels. In comparison, the herbal supplement 3300 mg/day was associated with reduced breathing rate, increased basal temperature, and systolic blood pressure, both compared to the placebo group. However, despite significant differences, none of these was clinically significant. CONCLUSION: The oral herbal supplement had a favorable safety and tolerability profile in studied women. There is a need to study its potential as an option to treat menopausal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Lagerstroemia speciosa (L.) Pers., (Lythraceae), commonly called Banaba, is a native plant of Southeast Asia and is widely used in the treatment of diabetics, obesity, kidney diseases, and other inflammatory disorders. L. speciosa consists of several phytoconstituents like glycosides, flavones, corosolic acid, ellagic acids, triterpenes, tannins, which are reported to be present in leaves, stem, flowers, fruit, bark, and roots. This paper presents an investigation on the binding interaction of phytosterols derivatives identified from the ethanolic extract of Lagerstroemia speciosa seeds against breast cancer target protein. The ethanolic extracts Lagerstroemia speciosa seeds were analyzed via GC-MS for the identification of their chemical constituent. In silico methods are adopted to predict ADME parameters, pharmacokinetic properties, drug-likeliness, and acute toxicity of the identified phytosterols molecules. Molecular docking analysis of the phytosterols was performed against three breast cancer targets. A total of 29 compounds were identified from the extract by GC-MS analysis, among which four phytosterols derivatives namely cholesterol margarate, 7-dehydrodiosgenin, Stigmastan-3,5-diene, and γ-sitosterol have been considered for the present study. These phytosterols are identified as non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, and non-mutagenic. Molecular docking studies reveal the extent of molecular interaction with breast cancer targets. The outcomes of the investigation suggest that the phytosterols obtained from the ethanolic seed extract of Lagerstroemia speciosa could act as a promising candidate against breast cancer."

This study aims to evaluate the anti-breast tumor effects of daucosterol linolenate (DLA), daucosterol linoleate (DL), and daucosterol palmitate (DP) from sweet potato in MCF-7 xenograft nude mice by determining the tumor growth, serum tumor markers, tumor-related proteins, and performing 16S rDNA sequencing. After treatment at 87.8 mg/kg/day for 29 days, DLA, DL and DP delayed tumor growth and decreased levels of tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125) and cancer antigen 153 (CA153) in vivo. All treatments activated caspase 3, 9, PARP1 cleavage, down-regulated Ki67, VEGF, BCL-2, BCL-XL, up-regulated BAX expression, and inhibited PI3K/AKT/NF-κB activation in tumor tissues. Their anti-breast tumor effects were associated with the regulation on gut microbiota. The three treatments increased Bacteroidetes whereas decreased Firmicutes richness. They also modulated the diversity of gut microbiota at family and genus levels. Furthermore, DL treatment promoted butyric acid secretion, DP promoted acetic acid and butyric acid secretion in the colorectal and feces. Our findings indicate that DLA, DL, and DP inhibit tumor growth in MCF-7 xenograft nude mice by regulating the homeostasis of gut microbiota, producing SCFAs, and then disturbing the expression of cancer-related proteins. The present study suggests three phytosterols as gut microbiota regulator for breast cancer prevention.",

      "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia is described as an increase in serum and/or plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, or both. This disturbance can be primary in some cases, or combined with other comorbidities such as endocrinopathies, liver diseases, or specific drug use. Among the various ways to control dyslipidemia are specific diets, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, or hypolipemiant treatment. Herbal medicine has been used in the human clinical routine to reduce cholesterol circulation. With an aim to expand its application in veterinary medicine, we analyzed the use of phytosterols in dogs as a potential alternative to control hypercholesterolemia. We performed lipidogram analysis in healthy dogs to examine the possible adverse effects during the treatment. Eight Beagle dogs received orally two 650 mg capsules of phytosterols (Collestra, Aché), for 15 consecutive d, along with the 2 usual meals. All animals remained clinically stable during the trial. There were significant alterations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels during the trial. LDL was reduced (86.8 ± 29.89 mg/dL [D0], 74.45 ± 31.58 mg/dL [D8], and 58.91 ± 18.65 mg/dL [D15]; P = 0.0442) and HDL was elevated (83.40 ± 12.05 mg/dL [D0], 86.46 ± 13.05 mg/dL [D8], and 101.5 ± 10.52 [D15]; P = 0.0141), while total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations remained constant and within the normal range for canine species. Thus, a 1300 mg dose of phytosterols, administrated orally and fractionated along with the 2 usual meals, was capable of reducing LDL and increasing HDL concentration in healthy nondyslipidemic dogs, which makes them candidates to be included on the list of hypolipemiant drugs for clinical use in dogs with hypercholesterolemia.",

      "abstract": "This study used highly lipophilic agents with an aim to increase the oxidant inhibitory activity and enhance photothermal stability of a novel mixed soy lecithin (ML)-based liposome by changing the composition of formulation within the membrane. Specifically, the development and optimization of the liposome intended for improving Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value and %TEAC loss was carried out by incorporating a natural antioxidant, quercetin (QU). In this context, a focus was set on QU encapsulation in ML-based liposomes and the concentration-dependent solubility of QU was investigated and calculated as encapsulation efficiency (EE). To explore the combined effects of the incorporation of plant sterols on the integrity and entrapment capacity of mixed phospholipid vesicles, conjugation of two types of phytosterols (PSs), namely β-sitosterol (βS) and stigmasterol (ST), to mixed membranes at different ratios was also performed. The EE measurement revealed that QU could be efficiently encapsulated in the stable ML-based liposome using 0.15 and 0.1 g/100 mL of βS and ST, respectively. The aforementioned liposome complex exhibited a considerable TEAC (197.23%) and enhanced TEAC loss (30.81%) when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light (280-320 nm) over a 6 h duration. It appeared that the presence and type of PSs affect the membrane-integration characteristics as well as photodamage transformation of the ML-based liposome. The association of QU with either βS or ST in the formulation was justified by their synergistic effects on the enhancement of the EE of liposomes. Parallel to this, it was demonstrated that synergistic PS effects could be in effect in the maintenance of membrane order of the ML-based liposome. The findings presented in this study provided useful information for the development and production of stable QU-loaded ML-based liposomes for food and nutraceutical applications and could serve as a potential mixed lipids-based delivery system in the disease management using antioxidant therapy."

Randomized cancer prevention trials in humans are unfeasible due to time and cost yet the cellular processes and signaling cascades that underpin anti-cancer effects of these phytochemicals have been explored extensively in vitro and in preclinical in vivo models. Here we have performed an original systematic review, meta-analysis, and qualitative interpretation of literature published up to June 2020. MEDLINE, Scopus, and hand-searching identified 408 unique records that were screened leading to 32 original articles that had investigated the effects of phytosterols or phytostanols on cancer biology in preclinical models. Data was extracted from 22 publications for meta-analysis. Phytosterols were most commonly studied and found to reduce primary and metastatic tumor burden in all cancer sites evaluated. Expression of pAKT, and markers of metastasis (alkaline phosphatase, matrix metalloproteases, epithelial to mesenchymal transcription factors, lung and brain colonization), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, CD31), and proliferation (Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen) were consistently reduced by phytosterol treatment in breast and colorectal cancer. Very high dose treatment (equivalent to 0.2-1 g/kg body weight not easily achievable through diet or supplementation in humans) was associated with adverse events including poor gut health and intestinal adenoma development. Phytosterols and phytostanols are already clinically recommended for cardiovascular disease risk reduction, and represent promising anti-cancer agents that could be delivered in clinic and to the general population at low cost, with a well understood safety profile, and now with a robust understanding of mechanism-of-action.",

The atomic net charge distribution, frontier molecular orbital energy (FMOE), and bond dissociation energy (BDE) of six phytosterols were calculated by density functional theory. Results showed that six phytosterols inhibited the formation of trans oleic acid, trans linoleic acids, trans linolenic acids, and total TFAs. The anti-isomerization effects of phytosterols were mainly associated with hydroxyl site activities, which were affected by the double bond position in the main skeleton of cyclopentane tetrahydrophenanthrene and the number of double bonds on the C17 branch chain. The FMOE difference and BDE of phytosterol molecules were closely related to their anti-isomerization rates. The anti-isomerization mechanisms of phytosterols on TFAs in peanut oil were proposed.",

At week 24, the proportion of participants with high triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL) in the phytosterol group was 15.65% lower than in the placebo group (p-value = 0.023). Similarly, half of the participants in the phytosterol group decreased their waist circumference up to 4 cm compared with 0 cm in the placebo group (p-value = 0.0001). We reported no adverse effects (diarrhoea or vitamin D reduction); nonetheless, almost 70% of participants in the phytosterol group self-reported an improvement in bowel habits.

Blood samples were collected and lipid profiles and biomarkers for inflammation and endothelial dysfunction determined. The results showed that PS treatment reduced endothelin-1 plasma concentration by 11% (p = 0.02) independently of variations in plasma levels of LDL-c. No alterations were observed regarding fibrinogen, IL-6, hs-CRP, SAA, TNFα, or VCAM-1 between placebo and PS-treated groups. Furthermore, PS reduced total plasma cholesterol concentration (-5,5%, p < 0.001), LDL-c (-6.4%, p < 0.05), triglycerides (-8.3%, p < 0.05), and apo B (-5.3%, p < 0.05), without changing HDL-c concentration (p > 0.05). Therefore, PS supplementation effectively lowers endothelin-1 independently of the reductions in plasma levels of LDL-c, contributing to the comprehension of the effect of plant sterols on endothelial function and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.",

To better understand the mechanisms of CD promotion, we performed proteomic quantification of the effects of hydroxypropyl-β-CD (HP-β-CD) on phytosterol metabolism in Mycobacterium neoaurum TCCC 11978 C2. Perturbations are observed in steroid catabolism and glucose metabolism by adding HP-β-CD in a phytosterol bioconversion system. AD and ADD, as metabolic products of phytosterol, are toxic to cells, with inhibited cell growth and biocatalytic activity. Treatment of mycobacteria with HP-β-CD relieves the inhibitory effect of AD(D) on the electron transfer chain and cell growth. These results demonstrate the positive relationship between HP-β-CD and phytosterol metabolism and give insight into the complex functions of CDs as mediators of the regulation of sterol metabolism.IMPORTANCE Phytosterols from soybean are low-cost by-products of soybean oil production and, owing to their good bioavailability in mycobacteria, are preferred as the substrates for steroid drug production via biotransformation by Mycobacterium However, the low level of production of steroid hormone drugs due to the low aqueous solubility (below 0.1 mmol/liter) of phytosterols limits the commercial use of sterol-transformed strains. To improve the bioconversion of steroids, cyclodextrins (CDs) are generally used as an effective carrier for the delivery of hydrophobic steroids to the bacterium. CDs improve the biotransformation of steroids due to their effects on steroid solubilization and alterations in cell wall permeability for steroids. However, studies have rarely reported the effects of CDs on cell metabolic pathways related to sterols. In this study, the effects of hydroxypropyl-β-CD (HP-β-CD) on the expression of enzymes related to steroid catabolic pathways in Mycobacterium neoaurum were systematically investigated. These findings will improve our understanding of the complex functions of CDs in the regulation of sterol metabolism and guide the application of CDs to sterol production.",

Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was aimed to investigate the effects of phytosterol supplementation on BP. An online search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane library and Google Scholar up to May 2019. Weighted Mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a fixed-effects model. The present meta-analysis of 19 RCTs showed that supplementation with phytosterols can decrease both systolic BP (WMD: -1.55 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.67 to -0.42, p = 0.007) and diastolic BP (WMD: -0.84 mmHg, 95% CI: -1.60 to -0.08, p = 0.03). Dose-response analysis revealed that phytosterol intake change SBP significantly based on treatment dose in nonlinear fashion. Subgroup analysis based on duration showed a significant effect of phytosterol on SBP and DBP in subsets of <12 weeks. In addition, a significant effect of phytosterol was observed in dosage of ≥2000 mg for SBP and <2000 mg for DBP. Based on current findings supplementation with phytosterol may be a beneficial adjuvant therapy in hypertensive patients as well as a complementary preventive option in prehypertensive and normotensive individuals. However, this issue is still open and requires further investigation in future studies.",

Improving dyslipidemia could slow down the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This is of great importance for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Phytosterols are natural active ingredients in plants. Many researches have shown that phytosterols have significant lipid-lowering activity,which could effectively lower blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Foods containing phytosterols have been widely used as therapeutic diets for improving dyslipidemia. In the early years,it was believed that the lipid-lowering effect of phytosterols was achieved by competitively inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol in the intestine since phytosterols had similar chemical structures with cholesterol. In further researches in recent years,more progress has been made in the lipid-lowering mechanisms of phytosterols. In this paper,PubMed and Web of Science were used to review the cholesterol-lowering and triglyceride-lowering mechanisms of phytosterols according to the available data published,so as to use phytosterols more rationally in clinical application to improve hyperlipidemia and other induced diseases.",

Many Chinese adults are lactose-intolerant and cannot tolerate bovine milk enriched with phytosterol. Soya-milk is a common beverage in Asia and it has beneficial effects on general health. We therefore conducted a randomized double-blind controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a phytosterols-enriched soya drink in lowering serum LDL-cholesterol level (primary outcome) and other cardiovascular parameters (secondary outcomes). METHODS: One hundred and fifty-nine normocholesterolaemic participants (85 men and 74 women; aged 19-79) were randomized to daily intake of one serving of phytosterols-enriched soya drink (N = 82), equivalent to 2 g of phytosterol per day, or a matched soya drink without phytosterols (N = 77) for 3 weeks. Adverse events, withdrawal and compliance were documented. RESULTS: Among the treatment group (N = 82), phytosterols-enriched soya drink significantly decreased LDL-cholesterol by 5.96% (SE 1.48, 95% CI - 8.91%, - 3.00%) with a median of 6.74% compared with baseline, resulting in a significant reduction of 4.70% (95% CI - 8.89%, - 0.51%; p = 0.028) with a median of 5.20% compared with placebo (N = 77). In contrast, there were no significant changes in other lipid parameters, blood glucose, blood pressure, body weight or waist circumference. Remarkably, 95% of the participants randomized to the fortified drink reported no adverse events at all. CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of a phytosterols-enriched soya drink may be a simple and cost-neutral means of lowering LDL-cholesterol in individuals in China, with massive population and rising incidence of coronary heart disease (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02881658; date of registration: 14 Aug 2016).",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Evidence exists regarding the beneficial effects of diets rich in plant-based foods regarding the prevention of cardiometabolic diseases. These plant-based foods are an exclusive and abundant source of a variety of biologically active phytochemicals, including polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates and phytosterols, with known health-promoting effects through a wide range of biological activities, such as improvements in endothelial function, platelet function, blood pressure, blood lipid profile and insulin sensitivity. We know that an individual's physical/genetic makeup may influence their response to a dietary intervention, and thereby may influence the benefit/risk associated with consumption of a particular dietary constituent. This inter-individual variation in responsiveness has also been described for dietary plant bioactives but has not been explored in depth. To address this issue, the European scientific experts involved in the COST Action POSITIVe systematically analyzed data from published studies to assess the inter-individual variation in selected clinical biomarkers associated with cardiometabolic risk, in response to the consumption of plant-based bioactives (poly)phenols and phytosterols. The present review summarizes the main findings resulting from the meta-analyses already completed. RESULTS: Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials conducted within POSITIVe suggest that age, sex, ethnicity, pathophysiological status and medication may be responsible for the heterogeneity in the biological responsiveness to (poly)phenol and phytosterol consumption and could lead to inconclusive results in some clinical trials aiming to demonstrate the health effects of specific dietary bioactive compounds. However, the contribution of these factors is not yet demonstrated consistently across all polyphenolic groups and cardiometabolic outcomes, partly due to the heterogeneity in trial designs, low granularity of data reporting, variety of food vectors and target populations, suggesting the need to implement more stringent reporting practices in the future studies. Studies investigating the effects of genetic background or gut microbiome on variability were limited and should be considered in future studies. CONCLUSION: Understanding why some bioactive plant compounds work effectively in some individuals but not, or less, in others is crucial for a full consideration of these compounds in future strategies of personalized nutrition for a better prevention of cardiometabolic disease. However, there is also still a need for the development of a substantial evidence-base to develop health strategies, food products or lifestyle solutions that embrace this variability.",

      "abstract": "Low fruit and vegetable consumption and high saturated fat consumption causes elevated circulating cholesterol and are breast cancer risk factors. During cholesterol metabolism, oxysterols form that bind and activate the liver X receptors (LXRs). Oxysterols halt breast cancer cell proliferation but enhance metastatic colonization, indicating tumour suppressing and promoting roles. Phytosterols and phytostanols in plants, like cholesterol in mammals, are essential components of the plasma membrane and biochemical precursors, and in human cells can alter LXR transcriptional activity. Here, a panel of breast cancer cell lines were treated with four dietary plant sterols and a stanol, alone or in combination with oxysterols. LXR activation and repression were measured by gene expression and LXR-luciferase reporter assays. Oxysterols activated LXR in all cell lines, but surprisingly phytosterols failed to modulate LXR activity. However, phytosterols significantly inhibited the ability of oxysterols to drive LXR transcription. These data support a role for phytosterols in modulating cancer cell behaviour via LXR, and therefore suggest merit in accurate dietary recordings of these molecules in cancer patients during treatment and perhaps supplementation to benefit recovery.",

A Markov model was created against a do-nothing option, from a governmental perspective, and with a time horizon of 40 years. Different data sources, encompassing clinical studies, practice guidelines, grey literature, and statistical yearbooks, were used. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on the base case estimates. With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio equal to international dollars (int$) 22,518.03 per quality-adjusted life-years gained, the intervention can be classified as very cost-effective. If adopted nationwide, it would help prevent at least 13,400 MIs, 30,500 strokes, and more than 10,600 and 17,100 MI- and stroke-related deaths. The discounted cost savings generated for the health care system by those who consume the fortified milk powder would amount to int$8.1 per person, corresponding to 0.7% of the total yearly health expenditure per capita. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Together with other preventive interventions, the consumption of milk powder fortified with potassium and phytosterols represents a cost-effective strategy to attenuate the rapid increase in cardiovascular burden in Malaysia.",

To address this, we developed liposomes containing brassicasterol, campesterol and β-sitosterol obtained from canola oil deodorizer distillate, along with alpha, gamma and delta tocopherol. Three approaches; thin film hydration-homogenization, thin film hydration-ultrasonication and Mozafari method were used for formulation. Validated liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was utilized to determine the entrapment efficiency of bioactives. Stability studies of liposomal formulations were conducted before and after pasteurization using high temperature short time (HTST) technique for a month. Vesicle size after homogenization and ultrasonication (<200 nm) was significantly lower than by Mozafari method (>200 nm). However, zeta potential (-9 to -14 mV) was comparable which was adequate for colloidal stability. Entrapment efficiencies were greater than 89% for all the phytosterols and tocopherols formulated by all three methods. Liposomes with optimum particle size and zeta potential were incorporated in model orange juice, showing adequate stability after pasteurization (72 °C for 15 s) for a month. Liposomes containing phytosterols obtained from canola waste along with tocopherols were developed and successfully applied as a food additive using model orange juice."

In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial trial, participants were randomised to receive bread fortified with placebo (PL), 2.3 g PS (PS), 228 mg curcumin (CC) or a combination of 2.3 g PS and 228 mg CC (PS-CC) daily for four weeks. Primary outcomes were fasting plasma lipids [total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG)] and secondary outcomes were plasma LDL-particle (LDL-P) profile: LDL-P number and LDL-P size. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (Framingham Risk Algorithm) was also explored. There was no significant difference between PL and CC or PS and PS-CC on blood lipids or CVD risk; therefore, groups were pooled for final analysis: the PL and CC group (PL-C, n = 36) and the PS and PS-CC group (PS-C, n = 39). PS-C significantly lowered TC (-0.52 mmol L-1, p < 0.0001), LDL-C (-0.49 mmol L-1, p < 0.0001) and CVD risk (-1.1 absolute %, p = 0.0005) compared to the PL-C group. Reductions from baseline in the PS-C group compared to that in the PL-C group were 7.6% and 10.6% for TC and LDL-C, respectively, and statistically significant (p < 0.0001). CVD-risk in the PS-C group reduced significantly (-12.7%) compared to that in the PL-C group (p = 0.0005). HDL-C and TG remained unchanged. The LDL-P number significantly decreased in the PS-C group by 124.33 nmol L-1 compared to that in the PL-C group (p = 0.005) and both groups showed a significant decrease in LDL-P size (p < 0.01); however, the absolute nm change in LDL-P size did not differ between groups and the percent change in LDL-P size in the PS-C group was borderline significant (-0.89%, p = 0.05) compared to that in the PL-C group. Regular consumption of PS-enriched bread with or without curcumin lowers blood cholesterol; however, curcumin alone did not influence blood lipids. Bread may be a convenient means of delivering PS with greater compliance for reducing the blood cholesterol concentration.",

Cirrhosis is the late-stage liver disease and can proceed to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pharmacological treatment options for liver diseases, cirrhosis, and HCC, are limited, expensive, and not wholly effective. The use of medicinal herbs and functional foods is growing around the world as natural resources of bioactive compounds that would set the basis for the development of new drugs. REVIEW AND CONCLUSION: Plant and food-derived sterols and triterpenoids (TTP) possess antioxidant, metabolic-regulating, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as they are recognized as anticancer agents, suggesting their application strongly as an alternative therapy in some chronic diseases. Thus, it is interesting to review current reports about them as hepatoprotective agents, but also because they structurally resemble cholesterol, sexual hormones, corticosteroids and bile acids due to the presence of the steroid nucleus, so they all can share pharmacological properties through activating nuclear and membrane receptors. Therefore, sterols and TTP appear as a feasible option for the prevention and treatment of chronic metabolic-related liver diseases, cirrhosis, and HCC.",

Thus targeting HDACs with inhibitors is a major focus in anticancer drug research. Although few synthetic HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) have been approved for cancer treatment, they have significant undesirable side effects. Therefore emphases have been placed on natural HDIs as substitutes for the synthetic ones. In a bid to identify more HDIs, this study evaluated the binding tendency of compounds derived from Morinda lucida Benth. towards selected HDACs for the discovery of potent HDIs as potential candidates for anticancer therapeutics, based on the report of anticancer potentials of Morinda lucida-derived extracts and compounds. Givinostat and 49 Morinda-lucida derived compounds were docked against selected HDAC isoforms using AutodockVina, while binding interactions were viewed with Discovery Studio Visualizer, BIOVIA, 2016. Druglikeness and Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion (ADME) parameters of the top 7 compounds were evaluated using the Swiss online ADME web tool. The results revealed that out of the 49 compounds, 3 phytosterols (campesterol, cycloartenol, and stigmasterol) and 2 triterpenes (oleanolic acid and ursolic acid) exhibited high HDAC inhibitory activity compared to givinostat. These 5 compounds also fulfill oral drugability of Lipinski rule of five. Morinda lucida-derived phytosterols and triterpenes show high binding tendency towards the selected HDACs and exhibited good drugability characteristics and are therefore good candidates for further studies in the search for therapies against abnormalities linked with over-activity of HDACs.",

Isolated compounds were tested against HeLa, MCF-7 and NIH/3T3 cell lines following MTT assay. Furthermore, the compounds were also docked against tyrosine kinase enzyme to predict the binding mode of phytosterols in the active sites of the enzyme. Beta-sitosterol exhibited considerable cytotoxicity against NIH/3T3, HeLa and MCF-7 cell with 67.05 ± 2.08, 79.63 ± 2.34 and 71.50 ± 1.57% lethality respectively at 1 mg/ml concentration. Median inhibitory concentrations calculated from dose response curve against NIH/3T3, HeLa and MCF-7 cells were 440, 170 and 200 µg/ml respectively. Stigmasterol was more effective against MCF-7 and NIH/3T3 cells by killing 87.50 and 81.45% cancerous cells respectively at 1 mg/ml concentration. Stigmasterol showed 77.25% cyctotoxicity against HeLA cells at 1 mg/ml concentration in MTT assay. The IC50 values for HeLA, MCF-7 and NIH/3T3 cells were 170, 60 and 140 µg/ml respectively. In docking studies, the docking score for beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol were -7.266 and -4.89 respectively. The binding energies for beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol were -41.21 and -41.04 respectively. Such lower binding energies indicate that the compounds fit into the active site more strongly. Binding affinities for both compounds were -7.76 and -7.68 respectively. Both phytosterols possess significant anticancer potentials and can be effective in the prevention and treatment of several malignancies.",

This makes sterols and stanols an attractive alternative for dietary interventions in cardiovascular disease prevention, particularly in populations at low or medium risk. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge derived from experimental studies and human data on the anti-inflammatory effects of phytosterols/stanols and their relevance in promoting atheroprotection and preventing cardiovascular disease. The anti-inflammatory effects induced by plant sterols/stanols have been demonstrated in in vitro studies and in experimental animal models. However, not all the beneficial effects seen at an experimental level have translated into clinical benefit. Indeed, clinical studies that evaluate the association between phytosterols consumption and inflammatory variables (CRP and cytokines) are inconsistent and have not yet provided a solid answer. Plant sterols have been proposed as useful adjuncts to statin therapy to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, there is limited available data and more research needs to be done.",

Compelling evidence supports the hypothesis that the manipulation of dietary components, including plant compounds termed as phytochemicals, demonstrates certain important health benefits in humans, including those in cancer. In fact, beyond their well-known cardiovascular applications, phytosterols may also possess anticancer properties, as has been demonstrated by several studies. Although the mechanism of action by which phytosterols (and derivatives) may prevent cancer development is still under investigation, data from multiple experimental studies support the hypothesis that they may modulate proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells. Phytosterols are generally considered safe for human consumption and may also be added to a broad spectrum of food matrices; further, they could be used in primary and secondary prevention. However, few interventional studies have evaluated the relationship between the efficacy of different types and forms of phytosterols in cancer prevention. In this context, the purpose of this review was to revisit and update the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms involved in the anticancer action of phytosterols and their potential in cancer prevention or treatment.",

Curcumin elicits hypolipidaemic and anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical studies, however, consistent findings in humans are lacking. OBJECTIVE: Concurrent PS and curcumin supplementation may exhibit enhanced hypocholesterolaemic and anti-inflammatory effects to optimise cardio-protection. The objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of dietary intervention with PS with or without curcumin on blood lipids (primary outcome) in hypercholesterolaemic individuals. METHODS: A double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial trial was conducted in hypercholesterolaemic individuals. Participants received either placebo (PL, no phytosterols or curcumin), phytosterols (PS, 2 g/d), curcumin (CC, 200 mg/d) or a combination of PS and curcumin (PS-CC, 2 g/d-200 mg/d respectively) for four weeks. Primary outcomes included fasting total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), TC-to-HDL-C ratio (TC:HDL-C). Secondary outcomes included anthropometrics and fasting blood glucose concentrations. RESULTS: Seventy participants with a mean (±SEM) fasting TC concentration of 6.57 ± 0.13 mmol/L completed the study (PL, n = 18; PS, n = 17; CC, n = 18; PS-CC, n = 17). PS and PS-CC supplementation significantly lowered TC, LDL-cholesterol and TC:HDL-C post-intervention (p < 0.05). Reductions from baseline in the PS group were 4.8% and 8.1% for TC and LDL-cholesterol respectively (p < 0.05). CC exhibited non-significant reduction (2.3% and 2.6%) in TC and LDL-C respectively, however, the PS-CC resulted in a greater reduction in TC (11.0%) and LDL-cholesterol (14.4%) than either of the treatments alone (p < 0.0001). The reduction in the PS-CC treatment was significantly greater compared to those for CC (p < 0.05) or PL (p < 0.01) alone. Plasma HDL-cholesterol and TG concentrations remained unchanged across all groups. No adverse side effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of curcumin to phytosterol therapy provides a complementary cholesterol-lowering effect that is larger than phytosterol therapy alone. Implications of these findings include the development of a single functional food containing both the active ingredients for enhanced lipid-lowering and compliance in hypercholesterolaemic individuals.

      "abstract": "Phytosterols are bioactive compounds found in foods of plant origin, which can be divided into plant sterols and plant stanols. Clinical studies consistently indicate that the intake of phytosterols (2 g/day) is associated with a significant reduction (8-10%) in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol). Thus, several guidelines recommend the intake of 2 g/day of plant sterols and/or stanols in order to reduce LDL-cholesterol levels. As the typical western diet contains only about 300 mg/day of phytosterols, foods enriched with phytosterols are usually used to achieve the recommended intake. Although phytosterols decrease LDL-cholesterol levels, there is no evidence that they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases; on the contrary, some studies suggest an increased risk of atherosclerosis with increasing serum levels of phytosterols. This review aims to address the evidence available in the literature on the relationship between phytosterols and risk of cardiovascular disease.",

A two-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical investigation on 50 postmenopausal women randomly assigned to two groups treated for 12 months with placebo or two sachets daily of Diascorea extracts containing 12 mg/dose was carried out. The main outcome measures were the plasma antioxidant activities, hematological profiles, and the concentrations of plasma lipids, including cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein,, and apolipoprotein A1 and B. A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test was performed to investigate the significance. Beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, 22-23-dihydro-, and γ-sitosterol were major phytosterols determined from Diascorea extracts. At six months in those receiving Diascorea, there were significantly decreased leukocyte counts (p < 0.01) and improvement on antioxidant activity of malondialdehyde (p < 0.001). After 12 months' treatment, elevations of hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume (p < 0.01) were noted in those receiving Diascorea. Moreover, the low dose Diascorea consumption in menopausal women for one year generally did not present positive effects on lipid profiles.",

Our aim was to test the effect on lipid profile of phytosterols, red yeast rice and their association. METHODS: We performed a three parallel arms, double blind, clinical trial randomizing 90 moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects to treatment with phytosterols 800 mg (group 1), red yeast rice standardized to contain 5 mg monacolins from Monascus purpureus (group 2), or both combined nutraceuticals (group 3). RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, in group 1 no significant variation of lipid parameters has been detected. In group 2 a significant reduction (p < 0.001) of LDL-Cholesterol (-20.5% vs. baseline) and Apolipoprotein B (-14.4% vs. baseline) as it occurred in group 3 (LDL-Cholesterol vs. baseline: -27.0%, Apolipoprotein B vs. baseline: -19.0%) (P < 0.001). LDL-Cholesterol and Apolipoprotein B changes were significantly different comparing group 2 with group 1 (P < 0.05), and group 3 with group 1 (P < 0.05). LDL-Cholesterol change was also significantly higher in group 3 than in group 2 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The association of phytosterol and red yeast rice seems to have additive cholesterol lowering effect, reaching a clinically significant LDL-Cholesterol reduction in mildly hypercholesterolemic patients.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Phytosterols are implicated in the development of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease. A newly proposed mechanism for phytosterol-mediated parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease is through phytosterol-facilitated hepatic proinflammatory cytokine release following exposure to intestinally derived bacteria. Whether the proinflammatory effects are liver cell specific is not known. AIM: To determine if phytosterols cause inflammation in hepatocytes or Kupffer cells independently or require costimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: In an in vivo study, neonatal piglets on parenteral nutrition for 11 days received an 8-hour infusion of LPS. In the in vitro studies, neonatal piglet Kupffer cells and hepatocytes were treated with media, media + 1% soy oil, or media + 1% soy oil + 100µM phytosterols. After 24-hour incubation, cells were treated with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid or liver X receptor (LXR) agonist GW3965 and challenged with LPS or interleukin 1β. RESULTS: LPS administration in piglets led to transient increases in proinflammatory cytokines and suppression of the transporters bile salt export pump and ATP-binding cassette transporter G5. In hepatocytes, phytosterols did not activate inflammation. Phytosterol treatment alone did not activate inflammation in Kupffer cells but, combined with LPS, synergistically increased interleukin 1β production. FXR and LXR agonists increased transporter expression in hepatocytes. GW3965 suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production in Kupffer cells, but obeticholic acid did not. CONCLUSIONS: LPS suppresses transporters that control bile acid and phytosterol clearance. Phytosterols alone do not cause inflammatory response. However, with costimulation by LPS, phytosterols synergistically maximize the inflammatory response in Kupffer cells.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths both in developed and developing countries. Since majority of the existing therapeutic methods harms both normal and malignant cells, a viable alternative is to switch into safe and beneficial traditional medicinal plants. Hence the present study was framed to identify selective anti-lung cancer agents from the medicinal plant Grewia tiliaefolia (GT). Cell viability experiments showed that benzene extract of GT (BGT) leaf effectively inhibited the growth of A549 cells, while being non-toxic to normal human lung L132 and PBMC cells. Ames and comet assays demonstrated that BGT is of non-mutagenic and non-genotoxic nature in untransformed cells. The hematological and histopathological profiles of the in vivo acute and sub-acute toxicity studies demonstrated that BGT is safe and tolerable. Importantly, western blot analysis and Annexin V-FITC staining confirmed that BGT promotes mitochondrial dependent apoptotic cell death in A549 cells by arresting cell cycle at G2/M phase. Bio-assay guided fractionation revealed the presence of phytosteols (β-sitosterol and daucosterol) which significantly inhibited the growth of A549 cells both alone and in combination. This study warrants that these phytosterols in alone or in combination can be considered as safe and potential drug candidates for lung cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the major causes of death and disability worldwide. In addition to drug treatment, nutritional interventions or supplementations are becoming a health strategy for CVD prevention. Phytosterols (PhyS) are natural components that have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels; while poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), mainly omega-3 (ω3) fatty acids, have shown to reduce triglyceride levels. Here we aimed to investigate whether the proteins in the main lipoproteins (low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL)) as well as proteins in the lipid free plasma fraction (LPDP) were regulated by the intake of PhyS-milk or ω3-milk, in overweight healthy volunteers by a proteomic based systems biology approach. The study was a longitudinal crossover trial, including thirty-two healthy volunteers with body mass index (BMI) 25-35 kg/m² (Clinical Trial: ISRCTN78753338). Basal samples before any intervention and after 4 weeks of intake of PhyS or ω3-milk were analyzed. Proteomic profiling by two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by mass spectrometry-(MALDI/TOF), ELISA, Western blot, conventional biochemical analysis, and in-silico bioinformatics were performed. The intake of PhyS-milk did not induce changes in the lipid associated plasma protein fraction, whereas ω3-milk significantly increased apolipoprotein (Apo)- E LDL content (p = 0.043) and induced a coordinated increase in several HDL-associated proteins, Apo A-I, lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), Apo D, and Apo L1 (p < 0.05 for all). Interestingly, PhyS-milk intake induced a reduction in inflammatory molecules not seen after ω3-milk intake. Serum amyloid P component (SAP) was reduced in the LPDP protein fraction (p = 0.001) of subjects taking PhyS-milk and C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2)expression detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in white blood cells was significantly reduced (p = 0.013). No changes were observed in the lipid-free plasma proteome with ω3-milk. Our study provides novel results and highlights that the PhyS-milk induces attenuation of the pro-inflammatory pathways, whereas ω3-milk induces improvement in lipid metabolic pathways.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soybean oil (SO) emulsions are associated with intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD); fish oil (FO) emulsions are used to treat IFALD. SO and FO differ with respect to their fatty acid and phytosterol content. In children with IFALD whose SO was replaced with FO, we aimed to (1) quantify changes in erythrocyte fatty acids and plasma phytosterols, cytokines, and bile acids and (2) correlate these changes with direct bilirubin (DB). DESIGN: This study enrolled IFALD children who received 6 months of FO. Blood samples were collected prior to FO, and after 2 weeks and 3 and 6 months of FO. The primary outcome was 3-month vs baseline biomarker concentrations. RESULTS: At study initiation, the median patient age was 3 months (interquartile range, 3-17 months), and mean ± standard deviation DB was 5.6 ± 0.7 mg/dL (n = 14). Cholestasis reversed in 79% of subjects. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid was greater than baseline (P < .001, all time points). Linoleic and arachidonic acid and sitosterol and stigmasterol were less than baseline (P < .05, all time points). Three- and 6-month interleukin-8 (IL-8) and total and conjugated bile acids were less than baseline (P < .05). Baseline IL-8 was correlated with baseline DB (r = 0.71, P < .01). Early changes in stigmasterol and IL-8 were correlated with later DB changes (r = 0.68 and 0.75, P < .05). CONCLUSION: Specific fat emulsion components may play a role in IFALD. Stigmasterol and IL-8 may predict FO treatment response.",

The phytosterols (ergosterol, brassicasterol, campesterol, fucosterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosterol) and the phytostanol stigmastanol were separated and analyzed in 8.5min. The sample pre-treatment procedure was optimized to be less time-consuming than any other published method, especially due to no need of derivatization, evaporation and even reconstitution step. The chromatographic separation was performed on the Kinetex 1.7μ Phenyl-hexyl column (100×2.1mm) with a mobile phase acetonitrile/water according to the gradient program at a flow rate of 0.9mLmin-1 and a temperature of 60°C. A tandem connection of PDA and CAD (Corona Charged Aerosol Detector) was used and both detection techniques were compared. The method was validated using saponification as a first step in sample pre-treatment and an universal CAD as the detector. Recoveries for all analyzed compounds were between 95.4% and 103.4% and relative standard deviation ranged from 1.0% to 5.8% for within-day and from 1.4% to 6.7% for between-day repeatability. The limits of detection were in the range of 0.4-0.6μgmL-1 for standard solutions and 0.3-1.2μgmL-1 for phytosterols in real samples. Although several gradient programs and different stationary phases were tested, two compounds, campesterol and campestanol, were not separated. Their peak was quantified as a sum of both analytes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phytosterols (PS), plant-derived natural steroid compounds, are novel feed additives to regulate immune function and promote pig growth. This study was conducted to determine the effects of PS on the immune response of weaned piglets. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty crossbred (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) piglets with an average initial weight of 9.58 ± 0.26 kg were randomly allotted to three treatments. Treatments consisted of a control, PS (0.2 g kg-1 ) and polymyxin E (0.04 g kg-1 , antibiotic control) treatment. The results showed that PS or polymyxin E supplementation remarkably decreased diarrhea rate and elevated CD3+ CD4+ /CD3+ CD8+ ratio in piglets compared with the control (P < 0.05). PS increased basophil and serum interleukin-4, and caused a shift towards Th2 profile by decreasing Th1/Th2 ratios in piglets compared with control (P < 0.05). Polymyxin E contributed to an increase in interleukin-10 compared with the control (P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in the amount of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium or Escherichia coli of jejunum among the three treatments (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PS supplementation has no significant effect on growth but could remarkably decrease diarrhea rate, and improve immunity and anti-inflammatory activity in weaned piglets. In addition, PS supplementation had similar effects on growth, anti-inflammation and intestinal microorganisms as supplementation with polymyxin E in piglets. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau is a traditional medicinal plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family. Its therapeutic potentials have been increasingly documented particularly the antiviral activity against Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. However, majority of these studies used crude or fractionated extracts and not much is known about individual compounds from these extracts and their biological activities. In the present study, we have isolated four compounds (CN1, CN2, CN3 and CN4) from the hexane fractions of C. nutans leaves. Using NMR spectroscopic analysis, these compounds were identified to be shaftoside (CN1), stigmasterol (CN2), β-sitosterol (CN3) and a triterpenoid lupeol (CN4). To determine the immunosuppressive potential of these compounds, their effects on mitogens induced T and B lymphocyte proliferation and the secretion of helper T cell cytokines were examined. Among the four compounds, stigmasterol (CN2) and β-sitosterol (CN3) were shown to readily inhibit T cell proliferation mediated by Concanavalin A (ConA). However, only β-sitosterol (CN3) and not stigmasterol (CN2) blocks the secretion of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). Both compounds have no effect on the secretion of Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ), suggesting that β-sitosterol treatment selectively suppresses Th2 activity and promotes a Th1 bias. CN3 was also found to significantly reduce the proliferation of both T helper cells (CD4+CD25+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+CD25+) following T cell activation induced by ConA. These results suggested that phytosterols isolated from C. nutans possess immunomodulatory effects with potential development as immunotherapeutics.",

The traditional southern Chinese diet typically contains many vegetables and not much meat, and there is high prevalence of lactose intolerance in Chinese; we therefore aimed to test if phytosterols-enriched milk is effective in lowering serum LDL-cholesterol in Chinese. Two hundred and twenty-one participants (41 men and 180 women; age 24-79) without cholesterol-lowering drugs or diabetes mellitus were randomized to daily intake of phytosterols-enriched low-fat milk which contained 1.5 g phytosterols per day (N = 110) or a conventional low-fat milk (N = 111) for three weeks. Fasting bloods were taken before and at the end of the study for the measurement of lipid and glucose profile. Physical examination was also performed. Comparing treatment with control, treatment group had significant decrease in serum LDL-cholesterol level (9.5 ± 2.0%; p < 0.0001). Phytosterols intake also decreased total cholesterol (P < 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.01). Consumption of a phytosterols-enriched low-fat milk led to a significant fall in LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure in Chinese. This can be recommended as part of a healthy diet for people. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02541201; Date of registration: 26 Aug 2015).",

      "abstract": "1To evaluate the content of phytosterol oxidation products (POP) of foods with added phytosterols, in total 14 studies measuring POP contents of foods with added phytosterols were systematically reviewed. In non-heated or stored foods, POP contents were low, ranging from (medians) 0.03-3.6 mg/100 g with corresponding oxidation rates of phytosterols (ORP) of 0.03-0.06%. In fat-based foods with 8% of added free plant sterols (FPS), plant sterol esters (PSE) or plant stanol esters (PAE) pan-fried at 160-200°C for 5-10 min, median POP contents were 72.0, 38.1, and 4.9 mg/100 g, respectively, with a median ORP of 0.90, 0.48, and 0.06%. Hence resistance to thermal oxidation was in the order of PAE > PSE > FPS. POP formation was highest in enriched butter followed by margarine and rapeseed oil. In margarines with 7.5-10.5% added PSE oven-heated at 140-200°C for 5-30 min, median POP content was 0.3 mg/100 g. Further heating under same temperature conditions but for 60-120 min markedly increased POP formation to 384.3 mg/100 g. Estimated daily upper POP intake was 47.7 mg/d (equivalent to 0.69 mg/kg BW/d) for foods with added PSE and 78.3 mg/d (equivalent to 1.12 mg/kg BW/d) for foods with added FPS as calculated by multiplying the advised upper daily phytosterol intake of 3 g/d with the 90% quantile values of ORP. In conclusion, heating temperature and time, chemical form of phytosterols added and the food matrix are determinants of POP formation in foods with added phytosterols, leading to an increase in POP contents. Practical applications: Phytosterol oxidation products (POP) are formed in foods containing phytosterols especially when exposed to heat treatment. This review summarising POP contents in foods with added phytosterols in their free and esterified forms reveals that heating temperature and time, the chemical form of phytosterols added and the food matrix itself are determinants of POP formation with heating temperature and time having the biggest impact. The estimated upper daily intakes of POP is 78.3 mg/d for fat-based products with added free plant sterols and 47.7 mg/d for fat-based products with added plant sterol esters. Phytosterols in foods are susceptible to oxidation to form phytosterol oxidation products (POP). This review summarizes literature data regarding POP contents of foods with added phytosterols that were exposed to storage and heat treatments."

METHODS: A comparison between a soybean oil lipid emulsion (Intralipid group A) and POLE with high (group B) versus low (group C) levels of phytosterols was made with regard to their effects on the general condition, hematological and biochemical parameters, urinalysis and histopathological changes in nine dogs receiving daily infusions for four weeks at dosage levels of 6, 6, 9 g fat /kg. RESULTS: Dogs in group A and group C remained in good condition and gained weight during the infusion period and no diarrhea or gastrointestinal bleeding occurred. Only a moderate degree of anemia was observed, the biochemical parameters changed only slightly and returned to normal after treatment had ceased. However, the dogs in group B exhibited significant symptoms of 'fat overload syndrome'. Vomiting, diarrhoea and blood in the faeces were observed. Moreover, triglyceridemia, cholesteremia, and dark urine as well as microscopic signs of liver and gastrointestinal tract damage and generalized jaundice were clearly seen. CONCLUSIONS: Phytosterols promote 'fat overload syndrome' in long-term tolerance studies of POLE in dogs by producing cholestatic liver injury and interfering with fat metabolism. And the toxicity of POLE was reduced by removing phytosterols.",

In this study, we assessed anti-atherogenic effects of a combination of wild rice and phytosterols in low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDL-r-KO) mice. Male LDL-r-KO mice were divided into four groups and fed with: (1) control diet; (2) the control diet containing 60% (w/w) wild rice; (3) the control diet containing 2% (w/w) phytosterols; or (4) the control diet containing both wild rice and phytosterols for 20weeks. All diets were supplemented with 0.06% (w/w) dietary cholesterol. Blood samples, hearts, and feces were collected and used for biochemical and histological examination. Consumption of 60% (w/w) wild rice in combination with 2% (w/w) phytosterols significantly reduced the size and severity of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic roots as compared to those in the control group. This effect was associated with significant reductions in plasma total, LDL and VLDL cholesterol concentrations as well as an increase in fecal cholesterol excretion. In conclusion, the dietary combination of wild rice and phytosterols prevents atherogenesis in this animal model. Further investigations are needed to understand mechanisms of action and potential clinical outcome of such dietary intervention.",

Whether PS consumption can also impact low-grade inflammation is unclear. Considering the low feasibility of outcomes studies involving PS consumption, investigation of surrogate markers of atherosclerosis represents a valuable approach. This study assessed the anti-inflammatory effect of PS consumption, according to inflammatory biomarkers, mainly C-reactive protein (CRP). METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic search of Medline, Cab Abstracts, and Food Science & Technology Abstracts was conducted through January 2015. Our study selection included randomized controlled trials (RCT), involving intake of PS-enriched foods as active treatment, and measurement of plasma inflammatory biomarkers. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed using average baseline and end-of-intervention concentrations and control-adjusted absolute changes in CRP and blood lipids. There were 20 eligible RCTs including a total of 1308 subjects. The absolute change of plasma CRP levels with PS consumption was -0.10 mg/L (95%CI -0.26; 0.05), a non-significant change, and heterogeneity had borderline significance (I(2) = 29.1; p-value = 0.073). The absolute reduction of LDL-C was -14.3 mg/dL (95%CI -17.3; -11.3). Meta-regression analyses showed that both the dose and duration of PS intake significantly influenced the absolute changes in plasma CRP (β = -0.35, p = 0.0255 and β = -0.03, p = 0.0209, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, regular intake of PS-enriched foods did not significantly change CRP, whilst LDL-C concentrations were significantly reduced. Further studies with higher PS doses may provide more definite conclusions on a potential anti-inflammatory effect of PS intake.",

For this purpose, margarines with similar compositions in acyl groups, but differing in the concentration of both fat and phytosterols, were heated at 180°C. The changes in the main components of margarine lipids and the formation of new compounds throughout the thermal treatment were monitored by (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The results show that the presence of high concentrations of phytosterols seems to have an antioxidant effect, since it slows down the thermo-oxidation rate of margarine and, consequently, the generation rate and concentrations of secondary oxidation products such as some aldehydes, epoxides and alcohols. The oil-water ratio also seems to have an important effect on margarine behavior, in such a way that the lower the fat concentration is, the higher its thermo-oxidation rate.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of phytosterols and phytostanols added to foods and food supplements to obtain significant non-pharmacologic serum and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction is well documented. Irrespective of age, gender, ethnic background, body weight, background diet, or the cause of hypercholesterolemia and, even added to statin treatment, phytosterols and phytostanols at 2 g/day significantly lower LDL cholesterol concentration by 8%-10%. They do not affect the concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein (a) or serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. In some studies, phytosterols and phytostanols have modestly reduced serum triglyceride levels especially in subjects with slightly increased baseline concentrations. Phytosterols and phytostanols lower LDL cholesterol by displacing cholesterol from mixed micelles in the small intestine so that cholesterol absorption is partially inhibited. Cholesterol absorption and synthesis have been carefully evaluated during phytosterol and phytostanol supplementation. However, only a few lipoprotein kinetic studies have been performed, and they revealed that LDL apoprotein B-100 transport rate was reduced. LDL particle size was unchanged, but small dense LDL cholesterol concentration was reduced. In subjects with metabolic syndrome and moderate hypertriglyceridemia, phytostanols reduced not only non- high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration but also serum triglycerides by 27%, and reduced the large and medium size very low density lipoprotein particle concentrations. In the few postprandial studies, the postprandial lipoproteins were reduced, but detailed studies with apoprotein B-48 are lacking. In conclusion, more kinetic studies are required to obtain a more complete understanding of the fasting and postprandial lipoprotein metabolism caused by phytosterols and phytostanols. It seems obvious, however, that the most atherogenic lipoprotein particles will be diminished.",

METHODS: Thirty-six HIV-infected patients treated with ARVs who had high LDL cholesterol levels but no current usage of any lipid-lowering agents were enrolled into the open-labelled, randomized, cross-over study. All patients were assigned randomly into one of four intervention groups: (1) pravastatin 40 mg cross-over to the combination of pravastatin 40 mg and phytosterols 2 g (combination group), (2) the combination group cross-over to pravastatin 40 mg, (3) phytosterols 2 g cross-over to the combination group, and (4) the combination group cross-over to phytosterols 2 g. Each active treatment lasted 4 weeks with a wash-out period of 4 weeks. RESULTS: The baseline mean TC, TG, HDL-c, and LDL-c levels in 36 HIV patients were 248.09 ± 34.73, 172.36 ± 125.44, 54.92 ± 16.67, and 175.13 ± 29.00 mg/dl, respectively. Pravastatin, phytosterols, and combination therapy reduced TC and LDL-c but TG and HDL-c were not significantly different from the baselines. The mean LDL-c reductions in the pravastatin, phytosterols, and the combination groups were 28.76 ± 9.32, 9.12 ± 7.84, and 27.08 ± 15.58%, respectively. The LDL-c levels in the pravastatin and combination groups were reduced more than in the phytosterols group (p < 0.01). There was no difference in the LDL-c reduction between the combination and pravastatin monotherapy groups (-25.61 ± 10.43 vs. -28.12 ± 14.07%, p = 0.555). CONCLUSION: Pravastatin had moderate potency on LDL-c lowering in HIV patients but could not bring LDL-c to goal. Adding phytosterols to pravastatin for a 4-week duration could not demonstrate any additional lipid-lowering effect TRIAL REGISTRATION: Thai Clinical Trial Registry: TCTR20150126002 date: January 23, 2015.",

      "abstract": "Plant sterols or phytosterols have been shown to be effective in improving blood lipid profile and thereby protective against cardiovascular disease. In addition to their cardioprotective effects, phytosterols have gained more insight for their protective effect against various forms of cancer. Phytosterols have been reported to alleviate cancers of breast, prostate, lung, liver, stomach and ovary. Reductions in growth of various cancer cells including liver, prostate and breast by phytosterols treatment have been demonstrated. Although exact mechanisms of phytosterols for their anticancer effects are not very well delineated, there have been several mechanisms proposed such as inhibition of carcinogen production, cancer cell growth and multiplication, invasion and metastasis and induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Other mechanisms including reduction of angiogenesis, invasion and adhesion of cancer cells and production of reactive oxygen species have also been suggested. However, cancer therapy using phytosterol formulations have yet to be designed, largely due to the gap in the literature with regards to mode of action. Furthermore, most of the studies on anticancer effects of phytosterols were conducted in vitro and animal studies and need to be confirmed in humans.",

In this study the additional effect of a low-fat PS-enriched fermented milk (PS-FM) on cholesterol metabolism markers and serum lipids was evaluated in the elderly on stable statin therapy with baseline LDL-C<3.35mmol/L. Thirty-five individuals (88.6% women; 81±8years old; BMI 29.9±6.0kg/m(2)), living in elderly nursing care facilities were placed on a daily intake of 2g PS-FM for 6weeks, in addition to their statin monotherapy. A fasting blood sample was collected at baseline (t0), after 2 consecutive periods of 3weeks intake (t1 and t2), and after 6weeks of washout (t3), for the analysis of serum lipid profile and cholesterol synthesis (lathosterol, desmosterol) and absorption (sitosterol, campesterol and cholestanol) markers. PS-FM consumption led to a LDL-C reduction of 0.15mmol/L (t1) and 0.27mmol/L (t2) from baseline (P<0.05). Serum campesterol and sitosterol (P<0.001) increased (t0-t1; t0-t2), reflecting PS intake and contributing to the inhibition of cholesterol intestinal absorption, leading to a decrease in cholestanol-to-cholesterol ratio. There was a reciprocal homeostatic rise of serum cholesterol precursors, desmosterol and lathosterol (P<0.001) from baseline, based on the up-regulation of the opposing pathway. Statin-treated elderly individuals, with baseline LDL-C<3.35mmol/L, may still have therapeutic benefit from strategies that reduce cholesterol absorption, such as 2g/day PS-FM.",

      "abstract": "Geographically the prevalence of duodenal ulceration is related to the staple foods in the diet in regions of developing countries where the diet is stable. It is higher in regions where the diet is based on milled rice, refined wheat or maize, yams, cassava, sweet potato, or green bananas, and is lower in regions where the staple diet is based on unrefined wheat or maize, soya, certain millets or certain pulses. Experiments on rat gastric and duodenal ulcer models showed that it was the lipid fraction in staple foods from low prevalence areas that was protective against both gastric and duodenal ulceration, including ulceration due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It also promoted ulcer healing. The lipid from the pulse, Dolichos biflorus, horse gram which was highly protective was used to identify the fractions with protective activity in the lipid. The protective activity lay in the phospholipid, sterol and sterol ester fractions. In the phospholipid fraction phosphatidyl choline (lethicin) and phosphatidyl ethanolamine (cephalin) were predominant. In the sterol fraction the sub-fractions showing protective activity contained β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and an unidentified isomer of β-sitosterol. The evidence from animal models shows that certain dietary phospholipids and phytosterols have a protective action against gastroduodenal ulceration, both singly and in combination. This supports the protective role of staple diets in areas of low duodenal ulcer prevalence and may prove to be of importance in the prevention and treatment of duodenal ulceration and management of recurrent ulcers. A combination of phospholipids and phytosterols could also play an important role in protection against ulceration due to NSAIDs.",

      "abstract": "Pulp and paper wastewater (PPW) contains significant concentrations of phytosterols, suspected of inducing endocrine disruption in aquatic species. Aerated stabilization basins (ASBs) are commonly used for the treatment of PPW, but phytosterol removal varies among treatment systems. The objective of this study was to better understand the removal processes and biotransformation of phytosterols within an ASB treatment system fed with untreated PPW. PPW settled solids and supernatant fractions showed that phytosterols are primarily associated with settleable solids, which carry phytosterols to ASB sediment where anoxic/anaerobic conditions prevail. Bioassays with supernatant and settled PPW fractions of the raw wastewater conducted under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively, showed that solids disintegration and hydrolysis results in phytosterol release in ASBs. A simulated ASB, fed with PPW and operated for 2.4 years at three hydraulic retention times (HRTs; 22.2, 11.1 and 5.6 d) with total phytosterol and solids loading rates from 10 to 42 μg/L-d and 44-178 mg/L-d, respectively, was used to determine the steady-state effluent quality and sediment characteristics. Although effluent COD and phytosterol concentrations were relatively low and stable (84-88% total COD removal; 82-94% total phytosterol removal) across the range of HRTs tested, sediment COD and phytosterol concentrations increased with increasing loading rate. On average, 51% of the phytosterols entering the ASB were removed via biotransformation, 40% were retained in the sediment, and the remaining 9% exited with the effluent. This study demonstrates the role of sediment as a source of phytosterol release in ASBs and highlights the importance of HRT and the PPW characteristics for predicting phytosterol fate in ASBs.",

In addition to discussing the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of PSs as hypocholesterolemic agents, this review provides an overview of PSs as an adjunctive therapy to cholesterol-lowering pharmaceuticals. Given this lack of evidence regarding the benefits of PSs for reducing cardiovascular end points, this review also discusses the present knowledge that exists about the ability for therapeutic dosages of PSs to confer protection from cardiovascular-related mortality and morbidity. Finally, this review summarizes the factors that affect PS efficacy and the Canadian regulations that govern the use of PSs as cholesterol-lowering agents in foods and supplements.",

Phytosterols were dissolved in ethyl acetate (8.3%) and added at various concentrations to the common diet in rumen fluid. In vitro gas production (GP) was recorded after 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h incubation. Incubation was stopped at 6, 12, and 24 h and the inoculants were then tested for pH, dry matter digestibility (DMD), microbial protein yield (MCP), lactic acid, NH3-N, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). GP was consistently higher than the control; particularly, treatments at 12, 18, and 24 h reached extremely significant levels (P < 0.01). Compared to the control group, the pH of ruminal fluid was slightly lower after incubation, and DMD and MCP increased with increasing phytosterol level except for the content of MCP at 6 h, which changed only minimally. Lactate was significantly lower after treatment compared to the control at 12 h (P < 0.01) and 24 h (P < 0.05), while NH3-N at 12 h (P < 0.05) and 24 h (P < 0.01) after treatment decreased significantly. Acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total VFA for all treatments were higher than those of the control, particularly for butyrate at 6 h (P < 0.01). These results suggest that phytosterols modify rumen fermentation by inhibiting released harmful products and promoting the release of beneficial product, which may be useful for improving nutrient utilization and animal health.",

      "abstract": "Various human trials and pre-clinical studies have suggested that dietary plant sterols possess hypotriacylglycerolaemic properties apart from their cholesterol-lowering properties. We hypothesised that phytosterols (PS) might attenuate triacylglycerolaemia by interfering with the deleterious effects of cholesterol overload in the liver. In the present study, twenty hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) with diet-induced combined hyperlipidaemia were fed a high-fat diet (HFD, n 10) or a HFD supplemented with soyabean PS (n 10) for 40 d. In parallel, a healthy group was fed a standard diet (n 10). PS normalised fasting plasma cholesterol concentrations completely after 20 d and were also able to normalise serum TAG and NEFA concentrations after 40 d. HFD feeding caused microvesicular steatosis and impaired the expression of key genes related to fatty acid oxidation such as PPARA, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-Iα (CPT1A) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) in the liver. PS treatment completely protected against HFD-induced steatosis and resulted in a normalised hepatic gene expression profile. The protection of the hepatic function by PS was paralleled by increased faecal cholesterol excretion along with a 2-fold increase in the biliary bile acid (BA):cholesterol ratio. The present study supports the conclusion that long-term consumption of PS can reduce serum TAG and NEFA concentrations and can protect against the development of fatty liver via different mechanisms, including the enhancement of BA synthesis. The results of the present study place these compounds as promising hepatoprotective agents against fatty liver and its derived pathologies.",

Phytosterols (PS) may be used for hypercholesterolemia in some groups and β-cryptoxanthin (β-Cx) displays a unique anabolic effect on bone. Our aim was to assess the changes in cardiovascular and bone turnover markers from the oral intake of β-Cx and PS in post-menopausal women. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized, double-blind, crossover study with β-Cx (0.75 mg/day) and PS (1.5 g/day), single and combined, was performed in 38 postmenopausal women. Diet was supplemented with 1 × 250 mL milk-based fruit drink/day for 4 weeks with a wash-out period of 4-weeks in between. Serum β-Cx and PS were determined by UPLC and CG-FID respectively. Outcome variables included markers of bone turnover and cardiovascular risk. Biological effect was assessed by paired t test and generalized estimating equations analysis that included the previous treatment, the order of intervention and the interactions. The intake of beverages containing β-Cx and PS brought about a significant increase in serum levels of β-Cx, β-sitosterol and campesterol. Intervention caused changes in almost all the markers while the order, previous treatment and the interaction did not reach statistical significance. Only the intake of the beverage containing β-Cx plus PS brought about significant decreases in total cholesterol, c-HDL, c-LDL and bone turnover markers. CONCLUSIONS: β-Cx improves the cholesterol-lowering effect of PS when supplied simultaneously and this combination may also be beneficial in reducing risk of osteoporosis.

Despite international recommendations on hypercholesterolemia management the percentage of individuals with LDLc plasma concentration above goals according to their global cardiovascular risk remains high, and additional therapeutic strategies should be evaluated. Consumption of functional foods enriched with phytosterols (PSRs) and phytostanols (PSNs) reduces LDLc concentrations by 10% as average. Although recommended as part of any lipid-lowering diet in the first intervention step, PSRs/PSNs maintain their LDL reduction capacity when administered with lipid-lowering drugs; therefore, they can be also considered in some cases as an adjuvant to drug therapy. In this document we summarise the latest evidence regarding the LDL reducing effects of PSR/PSN supplementation, alone or as an add-on to hipolipemic drugs and the international recommendations of its clinical use.",

      "abstract": "The biotransformation potential of three phytosterols (campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol) under denitrifying, sulfate-reducing and fermentative/methanogenic conditions was assessed. Using a group contribution method, the standard Gibbs free energy of phytosterols was calculated and used to perform theoretical energetic calculations. The oxidation of phytosterols under aerobic, nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions was determined to be energetically feasible. However, using semi-continuously fed cultures maintained at 20-22 °C over 16 weekly feeding cycles (112 days; retention time, 21 days), phytosterol removal was observed under nitrate-reducing and sulfate-reducing conditions, but not under fermentative/methanogenic conditions. Under sulfate-reducing conditions, stigmast-4-en-3-one was identified as an intermediate of phytosterol biotransformation, a reaction more likely carried out by dehydrogenases/isomerases, previously reported to act on cholesterol under both oxic and anoxic (denitrifying) conditions. Further study of the biotransformation of phytosterols under anoxic/anaerobic conditions is necessary to delineate the factors and conditions leading to enhanced phytosterol biodegradation and the development of effective biological treatment systems for the removal of phytosterols from pulp and paper wastewaters and other phytosterol-bearing waste streams.",

      "abstract": "Phytosterols are plant-derived sterols present in pulp and paper wastewater and have been implicated in the endocrine disruption of aquatic species. Bioassays were performed to assess the effect of an additional carbon source and/or solubilizing agent on the aerobic biotransformation of a mixture of three common phytosterols (β-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol). The aerobic biotransformation of the phytosterol mixture by a mixed culture developed from a pulp and paper wastewater treatment system was examined under three separate conditions: with phytosterols as the sole added carbon source, with phytosterols and dextrin as an additional carbon source, and with phytosterols added with ethanol as an additional carbon source and solubilizing agent. Significant phytosterol removal was not observed in assays set up with phytosterol powder, either with or without an additional carbon source. In contrast, all three phytosterols were aerobically degraded when added as a dissolved solution in ethanol. Thus, under the experimental conditions of this study, the bioavailability of phytosterols was limited without the presence of a solubilizing agent. The total phytosterol removal rate was linear for the first six days before re-spiking, with a rate of 0.47 mg/L-d (R(2) = 0.998). After the second spiking, the total phytosterol removal rate was linear for seven days, with a rate of 0.32 mg/L-d (R(2) = 0.968). Following the 7th day, the phytosterol removal rate markedly accelerated, suggesting two different mechanisms are involved in phytosterol biotransformation, more likely related to the production of enzyme(s) involved in phytosterol degradation, induced under different cell growth conditions. β-sitosterol was preferentially degraded, as compared to stigmasterol and campesterol, although all three phytosterols fell below detection limits by the 24th day of incubation.",

Four types of mushroom powder consisting of white, brown (Agaricus bisporus), oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus), and shiitake (Lentinula edodes) mushrooms from three different treatment groups (control, low and high UV-B exposures) were evaluated. Ergothioneine concentrations found in mushroom powders were 0.4-10.4 mg/g dry weight (dw) and were not appreciably affected by UV-B radiation. No individual polyphenols were detected above 0.1 μg/g. Phytosterols ergosterol (2.4-6.2 mg/g dw) and campesterol (14-43 μg/g dw) were measured in mushroom powder samples. Ergosterol concentrations decreased significantly with the increased level of UV-B treatment for all mushroom powder types, except for white. These results provide some new information on effects of UV-B radiation on these important natural bioactive compounds in mushrooms."

Although phytosterols are naturally present in the normal diet, daily consumption is insufficient to ensure plasma cholesterol-lowering levels. Therefore, phytosterols may be added to the diets to achieve the desired cholesterol-lowering activity. A subchronic laying hen safety study was conducted to examine if high-dose phytosterols could affect the safety of hens. Three hundred sixty 21-wk-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were randomly assigned to 5 groups with 6 replicates of 12 birds each; after 3 wk, birds were fed diets supplemented with 0, 20, 80, 400, and 800 mg/kg of phytosterols for 12 wk. Throughout the study, clinical observations and laying performance were measured. At the end of the study, birds were subjected to a full postmortem examination: blood samples were taken for clinical pathology, selected organs were weighed, and specified tissues were taken for subsequent histological examination. No treatment-related changes that were considered to be of toxicological significance were observed. Therefore, a nominal phytosterol concentration of 800 mg/kg was considered to be the no-observed-adverse-effect level.",

      "abstract": "Phytosterols are sterols found naturally in various oils from plants. Phytosterols compete with cholesterol for a place in the mixed micelles, needed for cholesterol absorption by the small intestine. As a result, cholesterol absorption, either from food or from bile salts is lowered by about 50%, leading to a towering of about 10% of blood cholesterol level, despite an increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis. This reduction is achieved when phytosterols are given both as monotherapy, and in addition to statin therapy. The average Western diet contains about 400-800 mg of phytosterols per day, while the dose needed for lowering the blood cholesterol level is about 2-3 grams per day. Therefore, for the purpose of reducing blood cholesterol, they should be given either as phytosterol-enriched food or as supplements. The reduction in the level of LDL-choLesterol achieved with phytosterols may reduce the risk of coronary disease by about 25%. Hence, the American Heart Association recommended the consumption of phytosterols, as part of a balanced diet, for towering blood cholesterol levels.",

      "abstract": "Phyto-sterols and extractives found in pulp mill effluents are suspected to cause endocrine abnormalities in receiving water fish. The control of sterols in pulp mill effluents through biological secondary wastewater treatment was studied using two lab-scale bioreactor systems. After achieving a stable performance, both bioreactor systems successfully removed (>90%) sterols and the estimated biodegradation was up to 80%. Reactor 1 system operating at 6.7 ± 0.2 pH effectively treated pulp mill effluent sterols spiked up to 4500 μg/L in 11 h HRT and 11 day SRT. However, Reactor 2 system operating at 7.6 ± 0.2 pH performed relatively poorly. Retention time reductions beyond critical values deteriorated the performance of treatment systems and quickly reduced the sterols biodegradation. The biodegradation loss was indicated by mixed liquor sterols content that started increasing. This biodegradation loss was compensated by the increased role of bio-adsorption and the overall sterols removal remained relatively high. Hence, a relatively small (20-30%) loss in the overall sterols removal efficiency did not fully reflect the associated major (60-70%) loss in the sterols biodegradation because the amount of sterols accumulated in the sludge due to adsorption increased so the estimate of sterols removal through adsorption increased from 30-40% to 70-80% keeping the overall sterols removal still high.",
