      "abstract": "Copper plays crucial roles in fundamental life processes, including proliferation, metabolism, and survival. Copper deficiency is associated with multiple diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and Wilson's disease. Therapeutic programs targeting copper supply are prospectively employed for disease intervention. Herein, we developed biofriendly copper ionophores (HQFs) by constructing pseudonatural flavonols, which possess flavonoid bioactivity and enhanced copper transport properties. In cell models and mice, we found that HQF-mediated copper delivery synergistically, safely, and efficiently intervened in the development of fatty liver. Mechanistically, NAFLD remission involves fatty acid metabolism, anti-inflammatory processes, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enhancement. Our work is the first to propose the utilization of synergistic copper loading and flavonoid activity for NAFLD intervention, which may inform the clinical management of liver disease.",

Current treatment options for EBV infection involve the use of acyclovir and its derivatives, which exhibit limited efficacy and are associated with drug resistance issues. Therefore, there is a critical need for new medications with more effective therapeutic actions and less susceptibility to resistance. This review explores the therapeutic promise of flavones and flavonols, naturally occurring molecules, against EBV and its correlated cancers. It thoroughly delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of these compounds and scrutinizes their complex interplay in EBV-linked processes and cancer transformation by targeting key genes and proteins pivotal to both the viral life cycle and tumor development. Additionally, the review covers current research, highlights key findings, and discusses promising avenues for future investigations in the pursuit of targeted therapies against EBV and its related tumors.",

      "abstract": "Due to its global burden, Targeting Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in humans is crucial. Herbal medicine has long been significant, with flavonoids demonstrating promising results. Hence, the present study aimed to establish a way of identifying flavonoids with anti-HBV activities. Flavonoid structures with anti-HBV activities were retrieved. A flavonol-based pharmacophore model was established using LigandScout v4.4. Screening was performed using the PharmIt server. A QSAR equation was developed and validated with independent sets of compounds. The applicability domain (AD) was defined using Euclidean distance calculations for model validation. The best model, consisting of 57 features, was generated. High-throughput screening (HTS) using the flavonol-based model resulted in 509 unique hits. The model's accuracy was further validated using a set of FDA-approved chemicals, demonstrating a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 100%. Additionally, the QSAR model with two predictors, x4a and qed, exhibited predictive solid performance with an adjusted-R2 value of 0.85 and 0.90 of Q2. PCA showed essential patterns and relationships within the dataset, with the first two components explaining nearly 98% of the total variance. Current HBV therapies tend to fail to provide a complete cure, emphasizing the need for new therapies. This study's importance was to highlight flavonols as potential anti-HBV medicines, presenting a supplementary option for existing therapy. The QSAR model has been validated with two separate chemical sets, guaranteeing its reproducibility and usefulness for other flavonols by utilizing the predictive characteristics of X4A and qed. These results provide new possibilities for discovering future anti-HBV drugs by integrating modeling and experimental research.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is among the well-known forms of cancer and a prominent cause of cancer demises worldwide. In vitro experiments reinforced by animal studies, as well as epidemiological studies of human colorectal cancer propose that the growth of this disease can be moderated by eating aspects. Dietary intake including green vegetables and fruits may result in the reduction of colon cancer chances. The finding suggests that the combinations of dietary nutrients may deliver additive or synergistic effects and might be a powerful method to avoid or eradicate colon cancer beginning and/or development. Flavonols are one of the most widespread dietary nutrients of the polyphenols-flavonoids and major constituent of Allium and Brassicaceae vegetables. Flavonols present in vegetables of Allium and Brassicaceae family are kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin, and isorhamnetin. These flavonols are claimed to have antiproliferative activity in vivo and in vitro against colorectal cancer. The objective of this review is to summarize the role of flavonols obtained from dietary sources in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer."

The best ligands towards the quorum sensing proteins LasR, RhlR, and PqsR were recognised using a molecular docking study. The gene expression in P. aeruginosa after treatment with test compounds was evaluated on quorum sensing genes including rhlA, lasB, and pqsE. The antibiofilm potential of chalcones and flavonols was confirmed by the efficient reduction in the production of virulence factors and downregulation of gene expression.",

      "abstract": "The complex and multi-stage processes of carcinogenesis are accompanied by a number of phenomena related to the potential involvement of various chemopreventive factors, which include, among others, compounds of natural origin such as flavonols. The use of flavonols is not only promising but also a recognized strategy for cancer treatment. The chemopreventive impact of flavonols on cancer arises from their ability to act as antioxidants, impede proliferation, promote cell death, inhibit angiogenesis, and regulate the immune system through involvement in diverse forms of cellular death. So far, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis occurring with the participation of flavonols have remained incompletely elucidated, and the results of the studies carried out so far are ambiguous. For this reason, one of the therapeutic goals is to initiate the death of altered cells through the use of quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, isorhamnetin, galangin, fisetin, and morin. This article offers an extensive overview of recent research on these compounds, focusing particularly on their role in combating cancer and elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis. Assessment of the mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of compounds in therapy targeting various types of cell death pathways may prove useful in developing new therapeutic regimens and counteracting resistance to previously used treatments.",

      "abstract": "Borax is strictly regulated in the food processing and pharmaceutical industry due to its physiological toxicity, and the development of a direct analytical method is essential for effectively monitoring the borax abuse. In this work, the fluorescence properties of flavonoids, including flavones, isoflavones and flavonols, were systematically investigated from aqueous to borax solutions, and it was found that the weak intrinsic fluorescence of flavonols could be pervasively sensitized by borax. A natural flavonol, morin, was subsequently chosen as a representative probe to develop a turn-on fluorescence sensing method for borax analysis, which achieved a linear response spanning four orders of magnitude with a detection limit of 1.07 μM (0.22 μg mL-1 in terms of Na2B4O7 content). Furthermore, a smartphone-assisted paper-based test device was designed and constructed by 3D printing technology. Using morin-impregnated test strips as the carrier, the borax could be visually detected by the RGB signals of the captured images, with a detection limit of 0.13 mM (27.05 μg mL-1 for Na2B4O7). Combining ion exchange treatment for food samples and sodium periodate oxidation for drug samples, the developed methods were successfully applied for the direct analysis of borax in various products with the recoveries of 86.9-106.3% for traditional fluorescence analysis and 82.7-108.8% for smartphone-assisted fluorescence sensing. The fluorescence property of the morin-borax system was studied using time-dependent density functional theory, and the sensing mechanism was discussed in conjunction with experimental research.",

The successful separation of five flavonols, namely stenopalustroside A (1), tiliroside (2), kaempferol (3), quercetin (4), and rutin (5), was achieved through phytochemical analysis. The compounds exhibited a range of inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase and α-amylase, with IC50 values ranging from 40 to 250 µg/mL. Notably, the biological activities of compound 1 have been reported for the first time. Compound 4 was the most effective inhibitor of both enzymes among the isolated compounds. Studies performed in silico reveal that the interactions between amino acids in compounds 4 and 5 are remarkably comparable to those observed in the positive control. These compounds share this commonality, and as a result, they both have the potential to be active agents."

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disease associated with reduced synaptic plasticity, atrophy of the hippocampus, and cognitive decline. Cognitive impairment results from several pathological mechanisms, including increased levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptors, prolonged oxidative stress and impaired activity of endogenous mechanisms of antioxidant defense, neuroinflammation driven by the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), decreased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and disturbance of signaling pathways involved in neuronal survival and cognitive functioning. There is increasing evidence that dietary interventions can reduce the risk of various diabetic complications. In this context, flavonols, a highly abundant class of flavonoids in the human diet, are appreciated as a potential pharmacological intervention against cognitive decline in diabetes. In preclinical studies, flavonols have shown neuroprotective, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and memory-enhancing properties based on their ability to regulate glucose levels, attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation, promote the expression of neurotrophic factors, and regulate signaling pathways. The present review gives an overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunctions and the results of preclinical studies showing that flavonols have the ability to alleviate cognitive impairment. Although the results from animal studies are promising, clinical and epidemiological studies are still needed to advance our knowledge on the potential of flavonols to improve cognitive decline in diabetic patients."

However, their effects on global gene expression and signaling pathways are unclear. To explore the roles of flavonol metabolites in signaling, we performed comparative transcriptome and targeted metabolite profiling of seedlings from the flavonol-deficient Arabidopsis loss-of-function mutant flavonol synthase1 (fls1) with and without exogenous supplementation of flavonol derivatives (kaempferol, quercetin, and rutin). RNA-seq results indicated that flavonols modulate various biological and metabolic pathways, with significant alterations in camalexin and aliphatic glucosinolate synthesis. Flavonols negatively regulated camalexin biosynthesis but appeared to promote the accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates via transcription factor-mediated up-regulation of biosynthesis genes. Interestingly, upstream amino acid biosynthesis genes involved in methionine and tryptophan synthesis were altered under flavonol deficiency and exogenous supplementation. Quercetin treatment significantly up-regulated aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes compared with kaempferol and rutin. In addition, expression and metabolite analysis of the transparent testa7 mutant, which lacks hydroxylated flavonol derivatives, clarified the role of quercetin in the glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway. This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms by which flavonols interfere with signaling pathways, their molecular targets, and the multiple biological activities of flavonols in plants.",

Here, we investigated the effect of light spectra on yield and total flavonoid content of Chuanxiong microgreens by treatment with LED-based white light (WL), red light (RL), blue light (BL), and continuous darkness (DD). The results showed that WL and BL reduced biomass accumulation but significantly increased total flavonoid content compared to RL or DD treatments. Widely targeted metabolomics analysis confirmed that BL promoted the accumulation of flavones and flavonols in Chuanxiong microgreens. Further integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis revealed the mechanism by which BL induces the up-regulation of transcription factors such as HY5 and MYBs, promotes the expression of key genes targeted for flavonoid biosynthesis, and ultimately leads to the accumulation of flavones and flavonols. This study suggests that blue light is a proper light spectra to improve the quality of Chuanxiong microgreens, and the research results lay a foundation for guiding the de-etiolation of Chuanxiong microgreens to obtain both yield and quality in production practice.",

Its main clinical manifestations include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stools. This disease is difficult to cure and even carries the risk of canceration. It has been listed as a modern refractory disease by the World Health Organization. Though a large amount of drugs are available for the inhibition of UC, the conventional treatment such as aminosalicylic acids, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressors, and biological agents possess certain limitations and serious side effects. Therefore, it is urgently needed for safe and effective drugs of UC, and natural-derived flavonols and flavanones showed tremendous potential. The present study concentrated on the progress of natural-derived flavonols and flavanones from edible and pharmaceutical plants for the remedy of UC over the last two decades. The potential pharmaceutical of natural-derived flavonols and flavanones against UC were closely connected with the modulation of gut microflora, gut barrier function, inflammatory reactions, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. The excellent efficacy and safety of natural flavonols and flavanones make them prospective drug candidates for UC suppression."

      "abstract": "Albino tea plants (Camellia sinensis) have been reported to possess highly inhibited metabolism of flavonoids compared to regular green tea leaves, which improves the quality of the tea made from these leaves. However, the mechanisms underlying the metabolism of catechins and flavonols in albino tea leaves have not been well elucidated. In this study, we analyzed a time series of leaf samples in the greening process from albino to green in a thermosensitive leaf-color tea mutant using metabolomics and transcriptomics. The total content of polyphenols dramatically decreased, while flavonols (such as rutin) were highly accumulated in albino leaves compared to in green leaves. After treatment with increasing environment temperature, total polyphenols and catechins were increased in albino mutant tea leaves; however, flavonols (especially ortho-dihydroxylated B-rings such as rutin) were decreased. Meanwhile, weighted gene co-expression network analysis of RNA-seq data suggested that the accumulation of flavonols was highly correlated with genes related to reactive oxygen species scavenging. Histochemical localization further demonstrated that this specific accumulation of flavonols might be related to their biological functions in stress tolerance. These findings suggest that the temperature-stimulated accumulation of total polyphenols and catechins in albino mutant tea leaves was highly induced by enhanced photosynthesis and accumulation of its products, while the initial accumulation and temperature inhibition of flavonols in albino mutant tea leaves were associated with metabolism related to oxidative stress. In conclusion, our results indicate that the biosynthesis of flavonoids could be driven by many different factors, including antioxidation and carbon skeleton storage, under favorable and unfavorable circumstances, respectively. This work provides new insights into the drivers of flavonoid biosynthesis in albino tea leaves, which will further help to increase tea quality by improving cultivation measures.",

Research has advanced to discover and identify the plant components with beneficial effects and reveal their underlying mechanisms. Flavonoids are phytoconstituents with anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, and antimicrobial properties. Herein, we listed and contextualized various aspects of the protective effects of the flavonols quercetin, isoquercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin and the flavones luteolin, apigenin, 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone, baicalein, scutellarein, lucenin-2, vicenin-2, diosmetin, nobiletin, tangeretin, and 5-O-methyl-scutellarein. We presented their structural characteristics and subclasses, importance, occurrence, and food sources. The bioactive compounds present in our diet, such as fruits and vegetables, may affect the health and disease state. Therefore, we discussed the role of these compounds in inflammation, oxidative mechanisms, and bacterial metabolism; moreover, we discussed their synergism with antibiotics for better disease outcomes. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics allows the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains; thus, bioactive compounds may be used for adjuvant treatment of infectious diseases caused by resistant and opportunistic bacteria via direct and indirect mechanisms. We also focused on the reported mechanisms and intracellular targets of flavonols and flavones, which support their therapeutic role in inflammatory and infectious diseases.",

The present research focused on the anti-inflammatory effect of these three flavonols in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The number and site of hydroxyl group in flavonols obviously affected their anti-inflammation activity. These flavonols suppressed the overproduction of nitric oxide. Fis showed the best activity with an inhibition rate of 52% at 20 μM. Moreover, the flavonols reduced the levels of ROS, TNF-α, and IL-6. The mechanistic study showed that they inhibited the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways by suppressing the phosphorylation of IκBα, p65, JNK, ERK, p38, MEK, and reducing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. In addition, the metabolism of the flavonols was examined. The results indicated that Fis was both methylated and glucuronidated. Que and Myr were mainly transformed into methylated products. This study highlights the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonols, particularly Fis, which has the potential for the prevention or treatment of inflammation as an adjuvant medicine or food additive."

      "abstract": "Despite the fast development of vaccines, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still circulating and generating variants of concern (VoC) that escape the humoral immune response. In this context, the search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds is still essential. A class of natural polyphenols known as flavonoids, frequently available in fruits and vegetables, is widely explored in the treatment of different diseases and used as a scaffold for the design of novel drugs. Therefore, herein we evaluate seven flavonoids divided into three subclasses, isoflavone (genistein), flavone (apigenin and luteolin) and flavonol (fisetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin), for COVID-19 treatment using cell-based assays and in silico calculations validated with experimental enzymatic data. The flavonols were better SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors than isoflavone and flavones. The increasing number of hydroxyl groups in ring B of the flavonols kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin decreased the 50% effective concentration (EC50) value due to their impact on the orientation of the compounds inside the target. Myricetin and fisetin appear to be preferred candidates; they are both anti-inflammatory (decreasing TNF-α levels) and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 mainly by targeting the processability of the main protease (Mpro) in a non-competitive manner, with a potency comparable to the repurposed drug atazanavir. However, fisetin and myricetin might also be considered hits that are amenable to synthetic modification to improve their anti-SARS-CoV-2 profile by inhibiting not only Mpro, but also the 3'-5' exonuclease (ExoN).",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, and oxidative stress is an important cause and therapeutic target of DM. Phytochemicals such as flavonols are important natural antioxidants that can be used for prevention and treatment of DM. In the present study, six flavonols were precisely prepared and structurally elucidated from Morella rubra leaves, which were screened based on antioxidant assays and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of different plant tissues. Myricetin-3-O-(2″-O-galloyl)-α-L-rhamnoside (2) and myricetin-3-O-(4″-O-galloyl)-α-L-rhamnoside (3) showed excellent α-glucosidase inhibitory effects with IC50 values of 1.32 and 1.77 μM, respectively, which were hundredfold higher than those of positive control acarbose. Molecular docking simulation illustrated that the presence of galloyl group altered the binding orientation of flavonols, where it occupied the opening of the cavity pocket of α-glucosidase along with Pi-anion interaction with Glu304 and Pi-Pi stacked with His279. Pi-conjugations generated between galloyl moiety and key residues at the active site of α-glucosidase reinforced the flavonol-enzyme binding, which might explain the greatly increased activity of compounds 2 and 3. In addition, 26 flavonols were evaluated for systematic analysis of structure-activity relationship (SAR) between flavonols and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. By using their pIC50 (-log IC50) values, three-dimensional quantitative SAR (3D-QSAR) models were developed via comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative similarity index analysis (CoMSIA), both of which were validated to possess high accuracy and predictive power as indicated by the reasonable cross-validated coefficient (q 2) and non-cross-validated coefficient (r 2) values. Through analyzing 3D contour maps of both CoMFA and CoMSIA models, QSAR results were in agreement with in vitro experimental data. Therefore, such results showed that the galloyl group in compounds 2 and 3 is crucial for interacting with key residues of α-glucosidase and the established 3D-QSAR models could provide valuable information for the prediction of flavonols with great antidiabetic potential.",

In this review, we collect recent evidence concerning the anti-cancer properties of the flavonols myricetin and kaempferol, discussing their mechanisms of action to give a thorough overview of their noteworthy capabilities, which are comparable to those of their most famous analogue, namely quercetin.

The compounds were screened against two bacterial (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) and one fungal (Candida albicans) strain and were also tested for their cytotoxicity on breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and normal murine macrophage (RAW 264.7) cell line. Effects of the compounds on attenuating the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in RAW 264.7 cells were quantified with the H2DCF-DA assay. This study revealed that flavonols (5 and 6) had the strongest antibacterial and antifungal effects, both having MIC values of 62.5, 31.25 and 31.25 µg/mL on E. coli, S. aureus and C. albicans, respectively. Compounds 2, 3 and 6 were the most cytotoxic against the breast cancer cells with IC50 values of 11.86, 12.62 and 14.03 µg/mL, respectively, while the least toxicity towards normal cells were observed in compounds 2, 5 and 6. All compounds (1-6) significantly lowered ROS production in RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, tested compounds represent potential promising candidates as antimicrobial, anticancer and antidotes for LPS-induced oxidative stress. This is the first report on the antifungal, cytotoxicity and antioxidative activities of the ent-kaurene diterpenoid, ent-kaur-15-en-18,20-diol (3)."

In this research, the interactions between specific flavonols and the 2019-nCoV receptor binding domain (RBD), transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and cathepsins (CatB and CatL) were analyzed. According to the relative binding capacity index (RBCI) calculated based on the free energy of binding and calculated inhibition constants, it was determined that robinin (ROB) and gossypetin (GOS) were the most effective flavonols on all targets. While the binding free energy of ROB with the spike glycoprotein RBD, TMPRSS2, CatB, and CatL were -5.02, -7.57, -10.10, and -6.11 kcal/mol, the values for GOS were -4.67, -5.24, -8.31, and -6.76, respectively. Furthermore, both compounds maintained their stability for at least 170 ns on respective targets in molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations also corroborated these data. Considering Lipinski's rule of five, ROB and GOS exhibited 3 (MW>500, N or O>10, NH or OH>5), and 1 (NH or OH>5) violations, respectively. Neither ROB nor GOS showed AMES toxicity or hepatotoxicity. The LD50 of these compounds in rats were 2.482 and 2.527 mol/kg, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that these compounds could be considered as alternative therapeutic agents in the treatment of COVID-19. However, the possible inhibitory effects of these compounds on cytochromes (CYPs) should be verified by in vitro or in vivo tests and their adverse effects on cellular energy metabolism should be minimized by performing molecular modifications if necessary."

Repeated column chromatographies for two fractions led to the isolation of two aurones and two flavonols; (3) Results: Four flavonoids were identified based on a variety of spectroscopic data analyses to be leptosidin (1), leptosin (2), isoquercetin (3), and astragalin (4), respectively. This is the first report for isolation of 2-4 from CLFs. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis determined the content levels of compounds 1-4 in the MeOH extract to be 2.8 ± 0.3 mg/g (1), 17.9 ± 0.9 mg/g (2), 3.0 ± 0.2 mg/g (3), and 10.9 ± 0.9 mg/g (4), respectively. All isolated compounds showed radical scavenging activities and recovery activities in Caco-2, RAW264.7, PC-12, and HepG2 cells against reactive oxygen species. MeOH extract, EtOAc fraction, and 1-3 suppressed NO formation in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and decreased iNOS and COX-2 expression. Furthermore, all compounds recovered the pancreatic islets damaged by alloxan treatment in zebrafish; (4) Conclusions: The outcome proposes 1-4 to serve as components of CLFs in standardizing anti-oxidant, pro-inflammatory inhibition, and potential anti-diabetic agents.",

Intracellular transduction pathways that end in the activation of specific transcription factors are highly implicated in the onset and progression of pathological changes related to neurodegeneration, of which those related to oxidative stress (OS) and neuroinflammation are particularly important. Here, we provide a brief overview of the key concepts related to OS- and neuroinflammation-mediated neuropathological changes in neurodegeneration, together with the role of transcription factors nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). This review is focused on the transcription factor p53 that coordinates the cellular response to diverse genotoxic stimuli, determining neuronal death or survival. As current pharmacological options in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease are only symptomatic, many research efforts are aimed at uncovering efficient disease-modifying agents. Natural polyphenolic compounds demonstrate powerful anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, partially acting as modulators of signaling pathways. Herein, we review the current understanding of the therapeutic potential and limitations of flavonols in neuroprotection, with emphasis on their anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects along the Nrf2, NF-κB and p53 pathways. A better understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of their action may pave the way toward new treatments."

      "abstract": "Under high light conditions or UV radiation, tea plant leaves produce more flavonols, which contribute to the bitter taste of tea; however, neither the flavonol biosynthesis pathways nor the regulation of their production are well understood. Intriguingly, tea leaf flavonols are enhanced by UV-B but reduced by shading treatment. CsFLS, CsUGT78A14, CsMYB12, and CsbZIP1 were upregulated by UV-B radiation and downregulated by shading. CsMYB12 and CsbZIP1 bound to the promoters of CsFLS and CsUGT78A14, respectively, and activated their expression individually. CsbZIP1 positively regulated CsMYB12 and interacted with CsMYB12, which specifically activated flavonol biosynthesis. Meanwhile, CsPIF3 and two MYB repressor genes, CsMYB4 and CsMYB7, displayed expression patterns opposite to that of CsMYB12. CsMYB4 and CsMYB7 bound to CsFLS and CsUGT78A14 and repressed their CsMYB12-activated expression. While CsbZIP1 and CsMYB12 regulated neither CsMYB4 nor CsMYB7, CsMYB12 interacted with CsbZIP1, CsMYB4, and CsMYB7, but CsbZIP1 did not physically interact with CsMYB4 or CsMYB7. Finally, CsPIF3 bound to and activated CsMYB7 under shading to repress flavonol biosynthesis. These combined results suggest that UV activation and shading repression of flavonol biosynthesis in tea leaves are coordinated through a complex network involving CsbZIP1 and CsPIF3 as positive MYB activators and negative MYB repressors, respectively. The study thus provides insight into the regulatory mechanism underlying the production of bitter-tasting flavonols in tea plants."

They affect millions of people worldwide, causing thousands of deaths, and are treated with expensive medicines, such as antivirals or palliative measures. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to describe the use of quercetin-type flavonols against lower respiratory tract viruses and discussed the preclinical impact of this approach on different signs and clinical mechanisms of infection. The systematic review was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Scielo, and Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde (BVS). After the database search, 11 relevant studies were identified as eligible. The analysis of these studies showed evidence of antiviral activity of quercetin-type flavonols with significantly reduced mortality rate (M-H = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.65, p-value = 0.008) of infected animals and a reduction in the average viral load (IV = -1.93, 95% CI: -3.54 to -0.31, p-value = 0.02). Additionally, quercetin and its derivatives reduced the amount of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, mucus production, and airway resistance in animals infected with a respiratory virus. Overall, supplementation with quercetin-type flavonols is a promising strategy for treating viral-induced lower respiratory tract infections.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Mycobacterial infections and fast-growing strains are increasing globally with 8 million new cases and 1.8 million fatalities per annum worldwide. The acid-fast bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.t), can spread diseases like tuberculosis (Tb) and weaken the immune system. In Ayurveda, the Bauhinia genus is most valued for the treatment of tuberculosis lymphadenitis. The objective of the present study is to identify anti-tubercular compounds from the under-investigated medicinal plant B. vahlii Wight and Arn. using bioassay guided isolation. The antimycobacterial activity was evaluated against non-virulent strains: Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (ATCC 25177) and Mycobacterium bovis BCG (ATCC 35743). Also, antibacterial and cytotoxicity activities were tested to identify the specificity of the isolated metabolites. Bioassay-guided isolation yielded three known flavonols, namely quercetin (1), ombuin (2), and kaempferol (3), from the methanolic extract of bark of B. vahlii. The results of antimycobacterial activity tests revealed that 2 showed much better mycobactericidal activity than 1 and 3 under ex vivo condition with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 0.05 ± 0.01 to 0.26 ± 0.01 nM, and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranged from 2.85 ± 0.14 to 7.21 ± 1.09 nM against dormant and active forms, respectively. Also, compound 2 showed higher resistance with MIC values > 100 μg/mL against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the least cytotoxicity up to 100 μg/mL concentration against the tested series of cancer cell lines. The results revealed the Ayurvedic use of extracts of the Bauhinia genus for treating tuberculosis, and the key bioactive compounds were found to be flavonols (1-3). The present work provides the first evidence for the presence of antimycobacterial compounds in B. vahlii.

During the past few decades, the elderly population has grown 2.5 % every year. Unfortunately, there are no specific therapeutic remedies available to slow the onset or development of these diseases. An aging brain causes many pathophysiological changes and is the major risk factor for most of the neurodegenerative disorders. Polyphenolic compounds such as flavonols have shown therapeutic potential and can contribute to the treatment of these diseases. In this review, evidence for the beneficial neuroprotective effect of multiple flavonols is discussed and their multifactorial cellular pathways for the progressions of age-associated brain changes are identified. Moreover, the animal models of these diseases support the neuroprotective effect and target the potential of flavonols in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Due to the high incidence of fungal infections worldwide, there is an increasing demand for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. A wide range of natural products has been extensively studied, with considerable focus on flavonoids. The antifungal capacity of selected flavones (luteolin, apigenin), flavonols (quercetin), and their glycosylated derivatives (quercitrin, isoquercitrin, rutin, and apigetrin) along with their impact on genes encoding efflux pumps (CDR1) and ergosterol biosynthesis enzyme (ERG11) has been the subject of this study. Cytotoxicity of flavonoids towards primary liver cells has also been addressed. Luteolin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, and rutin inhibited growth of Candida albicans with the minimal inhibitory concentration of 37.5 µg/mL. The application of isoquercitrin has reduced C. albicans biofilm establishing capacities for 76%, and hyphal formation by yeast. In vitro treatment with apigenin, apigetrin, and quercitrin has downregulated CDR1. Contrary to rutin and apigenin, isoquercitrin has upregulated ERG11. Except apigetrin and quercitrin (90 µg/mL and 73 µg/mL, respectively inhibited 50% of the net cell growth), the examined flavonoids did not exhibit cytotoxicity. The reduction of both fungal virulence and expression of antifungal resistance-linked genes was the most pronounced for apigenin and apigetrin; these results indicate flavonoids' indispensable capacity for further development as part of an anticandidal therapy or prevention strategy."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne hemorrhagic fever caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV). The mortality rate of SFTS is pretty high, but no vaccines and antiviral drugs are currently available. METHODS: The antiviral effects of six green tea-related polyphenols, including four catechins and two flavonols, on SFTSV were evaluated to identify natural antiviral compounds. RESULTS: Pretreatment with all polyphenols inhibited SFTSV infection in a concentration-dependent manner. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) and (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) were 1.7-1.9 and 11-39 μM, respectively. The selectivity indices of EGCg and EGC were larger than those of the other polyphenols. Furthermore, pretreatment with EGCg and EGC dose-dependently decreased viral attachment to the host cells. Additionally, the treatment of infected cells with EGCg and EGC inhibited infection more significantly at a lower multiplicity of infection (MOI) than at a higher MOI, and this effect was less effective than that of pretreatment. Pyrogallol, a trihydroxybenzene that is the structural backbone of both EGCg and EGC, also inhibited SFTSV infection, as did gallic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that green tea-related polyphenols, especially EGCg and EGC, are useful as candidate anti-SFTSV drugs. Furthermore, the structural basis of their antiviral activity was identified, which should enable investigations of more active drugs in the future.",

      "abstract": "Polyphenols are beneficial to human health because of their bio-activities. In this study, two flavonols quercetin and myricetin with or without heat treatment at 100 °C for 30 min were assessed for their barrier-promoting efficiency in rat intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells. The results indicated that the heated and unheated flavonols at dose levels of 2.5-20 μmol L-1 had a nontoxic effect on the cells treated for 24 and 48 h but enhanced the values of cell viability larger than 100% (especially at a dose level of 5 μmol L-1). Moreover, the cells exposed to these flavonols of 5 μmol L-1 for 24 and 48 h had improved barrier integrity compared to the control cells without any flavonol treatment, reflected by enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance and anti-bacterial effect but decreased paracellular permeability and bacterial translocation. Moreover, the results from both mRNA and protein expression verified 1.1-3.4 fold up-regulation of zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-1 that are critical to tight junctions and barrier function of cells. Furthermore, the expression of other two proteins RhoA and ROCK in the treated cells was also down-regulated, demonstrating suppressed Rho activation and consequently barrier promotion via the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. Overall quercetin, due to its lower molecular polarity, mostly gave higher barrier-promoting efficiency than myricetin, while the heated flavonols were always less efficient than the unheated counterparts to promote barrier integrity of IEC-6 cells. It is thus highlighted that flavonols can provide barrier-promoting effects on intestinal epithelial cells with a promoting efficiency dependent on flavonol polarity; however, heat treatment especially excessive heat treatment of plant foods might lead to damaged flavonol activity."

      "abstract": "The serine-threonine kinase CK2, which targets over 300 cellular proteins, is overexpressed in all cancers, presumably reflecting its ability to promote proliferation, spread, and survival through a wide range of complementary mechanisms. Via an activating phosphorylation of Cdc373, a co-chaperone which partners with Hsp90, CK2 prolongs the half-life of protein kinases that promote proliferation and survival in many cancers, including Akt, Src, EGFR, Raf-1, and several cyclin-dependent kinases. CK2 works in other ways to boost the activity of signaling pathways that promote cancer aggressiveness and chemoresistance, including those driven by Akt, NF-kappaB, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, beta-catenin, TGF-beta, STAT3, hedgehog, Notch1, and the androgen receptor; it promotes the epidermal-mesenchymal transition and aids efficiency of DNA repair. Several potent and relatively specific inhibitors of CK2 are now being evaluated as potential cancer drugs; CX-4945 has shown impressive activity in cell culture studies and xenograft models, and is now entering clinical trials. Moreover, it has long been recognized that the natural flavone apigenin can inhibit CK2, with a Ki near 1 µM; more recent work indicates that a range of flavones and flavonols, characterized by a planar structure and hydroxylations at the 7 and 4' positions - including apigenin, luteolin kaempferol, fisetin, quercetin, and myricetin - can inhibit CK2 with Ki s in the sub-micromolar range. This finding is particularly intriguing in light of the numerous studies demonstrating that each of these agents can inhibit the growth of cancer cells lines in vitro and of human xenografts in nude mice. These studies attribute the cancer-retardant efficacy of flavones/flavonols to impacts on a bewildering array of cellular targets, including those whose activities are boosted by CK2; it is reasonable to suspect that, at least in physiologically achievable concentrations, these agents may be achieving these effects primarily via CK2 inhibition. Inefficient absorption and rapid conjugation limit the bioefficacy of orally administered flavonoids; however, the increased extracellular beta-glucuronidase of many tumors may give tumors privileged access to glucuronidated flavonoids, and nanopartical technology can improve the bioavailability of these agents. Enzymatically modified isoquercitrin has particular promise as a delivery vehicle for quercetin. Hence, it may be worthwhile to explore the clinical potential of flavones/flavonols as CK2 inhibitors for cancer therapy.",

Flavonols are known to have a variety of beneficial health effects; however, limited information is available on their fate in the digestive system. We investigated the digestive stability of flavonol aglycones and glycosides from green tea under simulated digestion and anaerobic human fecal fermentation. Green tea fractions rich in flavonol glycosides and aglycones, termed flavonol-glycoside-rich fraction (FLG) and flavonol-aglycone-rich fraction (FLA) hereafter, were obtained after treatment with cellulase and tannase, respectively. Kaempferol and its glycosides were found to be more stable in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids than the derivatives of quercetin and myricetin. Anaerobic human fecal fermentation with FLG and FLA increased the populations of Lactobacilli spp. and Bifidobacteria spp. and generated various organic acids, such as acetate, butyrate, propionate, and lactate, among which butyrate was produced in the highest amount. Our findings indicate that some stable polyphenols have higher bioaccessibilities in the gastrointestinal tract and that their health-modulating effects result from their interactions with microbes in the gut.",

The lamp used in the trial was similar to those used for fruit surface sterilization. Total flavonols were measured in leaves using the Dualex method. In a first trial conducted in greenhouse conditions, 6 days after the pulsed light (PL) treatment, flavonols were increased by 312% and 525% in the 3P and 4P treatments, respectively, in comparison to the those in the untreated control. Changes in the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters suggest that the PL treatment may induce limited and transient damage to the photosynthetic machinery and that the damage increases with the increasing number of pulses. The performance parameters were not significantly affected by PL and recovered fully by 6 days after the treatments. The 1P and the 2P treatments 6 days after the treatment showed a 28.6% and a 32.5% increase, respectively, in net photosynthetic assimilation, when compared to that of the control. However, 8 days after the treatment, there was no longer a difference between the treatments and the control in net photosynthetic assimilation. Eight days after the light treatment, the 3P treatment showed a 38.4% increase in maximal net photosynthetic assimilation over that of the control, which is an indication of positive long-term adaptation of photosynthetic capacity. As a whole, our observations suggest that PL could be used on field or greenhouse crops to increase their phytochemical content. No long-lasting or strong negative effects on photosynthesis were associated with PL within the range of doses we tested; some observations even suggest that certain treatments could result in an additional positive effect. This conclusion is supported by a second trial conducted in phytotrons. More studies are required to better understand the roles of the different wavelengths supplied by PL and their interactions.",

Based on these observations, the present study investigated the antinociceptive action of flavonol, 3', 4'-dimethoxy flavonol, 6, 3'-dimethoxy flavonol, 7, 2'-dimethoxy flavonol, and 7, 3'-dimethoxy flavonol and the possible mechanisms involved in these effects. The antinociceptive effect of the investigated compounds in doses of 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg was evaluated in male Swiss albino mice using the acetic acid test, formalin-induced nociception, and hot water tail immersion test. The role of opioid, tryptaminergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and K+ATP channels in producing the antinociceptive effect was also studied using appropriate interacting agents. Treatment with flavonol and dimethoxy flavonols resulted in a significant reduction in the number of abdominal constrictions in the acetic acid test, a significant inhibition of the paw-licking/biting response time in both the phases of formalin nociception and also a significant increase in mean reaction time in the hot water tail immersion test. These observations revealed the antinociceptive effect of dimethoxy flavonols. The role of opioid, serotonergic (5HT3), and dopaminergic system was identified in the antinociceptive effect of flavonol and all dimethoxy derivatives investigated. In addition, the role of GABAergic, K+ATP channel, and α-2 adrenergic mechanisms were also observed in the antinociceptive action of some of the investigated compounds. The present study identified the antinociceptive effect of flavonol and dimethoxy flavonols in mice acting through different neuronal pathways.",

      "abstract": "Plant reproduction requires long-distance growth of a pollen tube to fertilize the female gametophyte. Prior reports suggested that mutations altering synthesis of flavonoids, plant specialized metabolites that include flavonols and anthocyanins, impair pollen development in several species, but the mechanism by which flavonols enhanced fertility was not defined. Here, we used genetic approaches to demonstrate that flavonols enhanced pollen development by reducing the abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We further showed that flavonols reduced high-temperature stress-induced ROS accumulation and inhibition of pollen tube growth. The anthocyanin reduced (are) tomato mutant had reduced flavonol accumulation in pollen grains and tubes. This mutant produced fewer pollen grains and had impaired pollen viability, germination, tube growth, and tube integrity, resulting in reduced seed set. Consistent with flavonols acting as ROS scavengers, are had elevated levels of ROS. The pollen viability, tube growth and integrity defects, and ROS accumulation in are were reversed by genetic complementation. Inhibition of ROS synthesis or scavenging of excess ROS with an exogenous antioxidant treatment also reversed the are phenotypes, indicating that flavonols function by reducing ROS levels. Heat stress resulted in increased ROS in pollen tubes and inhibited tube growth, with more pronounced effects in the are mutant that could be rescued by antioxidant treatment. These results are consistent with increased ROS inhibiting pollen tube growth and with flavonols preventing ROS from reaching damaging levels. These results reveal that flavonol metabolites regulate plant sexual reproduction at both normal and elevated temperatures by maintaining ROS homeostasis.",

Traditional fertilization (TF) and organic fertilization (OF) have both been established there. This study examined their impact on the polyphenolic content of strawberries. RESULTS: Two anthocyanins were identified by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS). The average total anthocyanin concentrations were found to be 651 mg kg-1 fresh weight in 100% OF, which represents a 56% increase compared to fruits that were not fertilized. In the case of flavonols, only quercetin-rhamnoside was identified, and its concentration reached 14.6 mg kg-1 with 100% OF. The ascorbic acid concentration reached 0.54 g kg-1 in 50% TF (a 20% increase over fruits without fertilization, WF). The antioxidant activities slightly increased in the fruits subjected to TF and OF in comparison with WF treatment. CONCLUSION: These results support a management strategy for obtaining the best quality and potential beneficial effects in health by increasing anthocyanins and other polyphenols under OF. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",

It is now well established that though clearly beneficial, the positive outcomes of this intervention are limited by injury in response to the reperfusion itself in addition to the prior ischemia. This process is described as reperfusion injury and is considered to contribute to the arrhythmias, microvascular dysfunction and impaired cardiac contractility that is observed even after the restoration of coronary blood flow. Thus an important, currently unmet, therapeutic challenge is to address the outcomes of this reperfusion injury. In this article, we review the evidence that flavonols and flavones may prove useful in preserving cardiac function after ischemia and reperfusion and consider the possible mechanisms, in particular, the inhibition of kinases, by which they may exert protection.",

Dietary polyphenols offer a complementary approach to the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), a group of common chronic intestinal inflammation syndromes for which there is no cure. Tomato is widely consumed but its content of polyphenols is low. We developed a tomato variety, Bronze, enriched in three distinct classes of polyphenols: flavonols, anthocyanins, and stilbenoids. Using Bronze tomatoes as a dietary supplement as well as Indigo (high anthocyanins and flavonols), ResTom (high stilbenoids) and wild-type tomatoes, we examined the effects of the different polyphenols on the host gut microbiota, inflammatory responses, and the symptoms of chronic IBD, in a mouse model. Bronze tomatoes significantly impacted the symptoms of IBD. A similar result was observed using diets supplemented with red grape skin containing flavonols, anthocyanins, and stilbenoids, suggesting that effective protection is provided by different classes of polyphenols acting synergistically."

METHOD: We collected relevant publications, during the period of 2000 to 2016, emphasizing in vivo and in vitro studies with neurological assessment of flavonol's potentials, as well as classifying studies according to evidence levels, in order to elucidate evidence-based literature and its application on clinical research. In addition, we highlight the importance of flavonols in modern research fields, indicating their neuroprotective potential and use thereof as preventive and therapeutic treatment of numerous neurodegenerative disease. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, represent worldwide a major health problem with great financial impact. They are multifactorial diseases, hallmarked by similar pathogenesis that covers conditions such as oxidative stress, formation of free radicals, abnormal protein dynamics (degradation and aggregation), mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation and cellular death or senescence. Flavonols are polyphenolic compounds, widely distributed in the plant kingdom and found in high concentrations in vegetables, fruits and teas. Their neuroprotective effects are mainly related to their antioxidant, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSION: It was this paper's intention to contribute with an evidence analysis of recent studies approaching neuroprotective effects of flavonols and the potential to conduct human clinical studies.",

In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), we find that ABA-increased ROS is followed by stomatal closure and that both responses are blocked by inhibitors of ROS-producing respiratory burst oxidase enzymes. ABA-induced ROS sensor fluorescence accumulates in the nucleus, chloroplasts, and endomembranes. The accumulation of flavonol antioxidants in guard cells, but not surrounding pavement cells, was visualized by confocal microscopy using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye. Decreased flavonols in guard cells in the anthocyanin reduced (are) mutant and elevated levels in the anthocyanin without (aw) mutant were quantified by confocal microscopy and in leaf extracts by mass spectrometry. Consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants, higher levels of ROS were detected in guard cells of the tomato are mutant and lower levels were detected in aw both at homeostasis and after treatment with ABA. These results demonstrate the inverse relationship between flavonols and ROS. Guard cells of are show greater ABA-induced closure than the wild type, reduced light-dependent guard cell opening, and reduced water loss, with aw having opposite responses. Ethylene treatment of wild-type tomato plants increased flavonol accumulation in guard cells; however, no flavonol increases were observed in Neverripe (Nr), an ethylene receptor mutant. Consistent with lower levels of ROS due to elevated flavonols, ethylene treatments decreased ABA-induced stomatal closure in the wild type, but not Nr, with ethylene responses attenuated in the are mutant. Together, these results are consistent with flavonols dampening the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closure and facilitating stomatal opening to modulate leaf gas exchange.",

Ethanol extract of brazilian green propolis (EBGP) protected N2a cells against mutant SOD1-induced neurotoxicity and reduced aggregated mutant SOD1 by induction of autophagy. Kaempferide and kaempferol, the active ingredients of EBGP, also inhibited mutant SOD1-induced cell death and reduced the intracellular mutant SOD1 aggregates.

      "abstract": "Despite numerous studies chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) still remains an incurable disease. Therefore, all new compounds and novel strategies which are able to eradicate CLL cells should be considered as valuable clues for a potential future remedy against this malignancy. In the present study, the cytotoxic profiles of natural flavonoids were described in two human CLL cell lines, HG-3 and EHEB, indicating the flavone luteolin as the most potent flavonoid with half-maximal inhibitory constants (IC50) of 37 μM and 26 μM, respectively. Luteolin significantly increased the apoptotic cell population in both cell lines by increasing the activities of caspases-3 and -9 and triggering the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Two flavonols, fisetin and quercetin, were somewhat less efficient in suppressing cellular viability, whereas baicalein, chrysin, (+)-catechin and hesperetin exerted only a small or no response at doses as high as 100 μM. Both fisetin and quercetin were able to augment the cytotoxic activity of luteolin in both cell lines by reducing the IC50 values up to four fold. As a result of this, luteolin displayed cytotoxicity activity already at low micromolar concentrations that could potentially be physiologically achievable through oral ingestion. No other tested flavonoids were capable of sensitizing CLL cells to luteolin pointing to a specific binding of fisetin and quercetin to the cellular targets which interfere with the signaling pathways induced by luteolin. Although further molecular studies to unravel this potentiating mechanism are certainly needed, this phenomenon could contribute to future remedies for prevention and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",

Although multiple pathways, enzymes, and antioxidants are present in plants, their exact roles during different stress responses remain unclear. Here, we report on the characterization of the different antioxidant mechanisms of tomato plants subjected to heat stress, salinity stress, or a combination of both stresses. All the treatments applied induced an increase of oxidative stress, with the salinity treatment being the most aggressive, resulting in plants with the lowest biomass, and the highest levels of H2O2 accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation. However, the results obtained from the transcript expression study and enzymatic activities related to the ascorbate-glutathione pathway did not fully explain the differences in the oxidative damage observed between salinity and the combination of salinity and heat. An exhaustive metabolomics study revealed the differential accumulation of phenolic compounds depending on the type of abiotic stress applied. An analysis at gene and enzyme levels of the phenylpropanoid metabolism concluded that under conditions where flavonols accumulated to a greater degree as compared to hydroxycinnamic acids, the oxidative damage was lower, highlighting the importance of flavonols as powerful antioxidants, and their role in abiotic stress tolerance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemical elicitation is one of the most effective methods currently used to enrich plant foods in bioactive compounds. Methyl jasmonate (MJ) has been described as a very useful elicitor of some plant compounds, polyphenols among them. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of pre-harvest MJ application on the increase in the main flavonoids and the antioxidant properties of black currant (Ribes nigrum) cultivars. RESULTS: Significant enhancement of individual and total anthocyanins was measured after elicitation with MJ, particularly when a concentration of 0.2 mmol L(-1) was used. Total anthocyanins increased from 28288.74 ± 253.65 to 43561.08 ± 145.87 mg kg(-1) in Ben Hope black currants after elicitation with 0.2 mmol L(-1) MJ. Similarly, an increase from 35986.04 ± 287.98 to 41320.22 ± 109.38 mg kg(-1) was estimated in Ben Alder cultivar. Black currant flavonols were not individually affected by the treatment; however, total flavonols increased from 3115.21 ± 12.11 to 3268.41 ± 8.91 mg kg(-1) in Ben Hope and from 3016.38 ± 10.07 to 3110.95 ± 8.57 mg kg(-1) in Ben Alder. Antioxidant properties of black currants as measured by DPPH and ABTS assays improved proportionally to the increase in flavonoid content after MJ elicitation. CONCLUSION: Pre-harvest elicitation with MJ is proposed as a useful tool to enhance contents of anthocyanins and flavonols as well as free radical-scavenging activity of black currants. The functional black currants obtained here can be interesting for industry, for consumption as fresh fruits and for production of juice and jam. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Here we evaluated the antiproliferative activity of selected synthetic flavonoids against human leukemia cell lines. We found that 4'-bromoflavonol (flavonol 3) was the most potent. This compound inhibited proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, induced apoptosis and blocked cell cycle progression at the S phase. Cell death was found to be associated with the cleavage and activation of multiple caspases, the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the up-regulation of two death receptors (death receptor 4 and death receptor 5) for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Moreover, combined treatments using 4'-bromoflavonol and TRAIL led to an increased cytotoxicity compared to single treatments. These results provide a basis for further exploring the potential applications of this combination for the treatment of cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The edible fruits of Phaleria macrocarpa (Scheff.) Boerl are widely used in traditional medicine in Indonesia. It is used to treat a variety of medical conditions such as - cancer, diabetes mellitus, allergies, liver and heart diseases, kidney failure, blood diseases, high blood pressure, stroke, various skin diseases, itching, aches, and flu. Therefore, it is of great interest to determine the biochemical and cytotoxic properties of the fruit extracts. METHODS: The methanol, hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and water extracts of P. macrocarpa fruits were examined for phytochemicals, physicochemicals, flavonols, flavonoids and phenol content. Its nutritional value (A.O.A.C method), antioxidant properties (DPPH assay) and cytotoxicity (MTT cell proliferation assay) were also determined. RESULTS: A preliminary phyotochemical screening of the different crude extracts from the fruits of P. macrocarpa showed the presence secondary metabolites such as of flavonoids, phenols, saponin glycosides and tannins. The ethyl acetate and methanol extracts displayed high antioxidant acitivity (IC50 value of 8.15±0.02 ug/mL) in the DPPH assay comparable to that of the standard gallic acid (IC50 value of 10.8±0.02 ug/mL). Evaluation of cytotoxic activity showed that the crude methanol extract possessed excellent anti-proliferative activity against SKOV-3 (IC50 7.75±2.56 μg/mL) after 72 hours of treatment whilst the hexane and ethyl acetate extracts displayed good cytotoxic effect against both SKOV-3 and MDA-MB231 cell lines. The chloroform extract however, showed selective inhibitory activity in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 (IC50 7.80±1.57 μg/mL) after 48 hours of treatment. There was no cytotoxic effect observed in the Ca Ski cell line and the two normal cell lines (MRC-5 and WRL-68). CONCLUSION: The methanol extract and the ethyl acetate fraction of P. macrocarpa fruits exhibited good nutritional values, good antioxidant and cytotoxic activities, and merits further investigation to identify the specific compound(s) responsible for these activities.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Que or DiOHF treatment on platelet function and ferric chloride-induced carotid artery thrombosis in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. Diabetic mice treated with Que or DiOHF maintained blood flow at a significantly higher level than untreated diabetic mice at the end of the recording period. In addition, treatment with Que or DiOHF significantly reduced diabetes-induced platelet hyper-aggregability in response to platelet agonist stimulation. Furthermore, treatment with Que or DiOHF significantly inhibited dense, but not alpha, granule exocytosis in diabetic and control mice. Our demonstration that flavonols delay thrombus formation in diabetes suggests a potential clinical role for these compounds in anti-platelet therapy.",

Here, we characterized rat systemic and cerebral exposure to these ginkgo compounds after dosing, as well as the compounds' pharmacokinetics. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats received single or multiple doses of ShuXueNing injection (prepared from GBE50 for intravenous administration) or GBE50 (a standardized extract of G. biloba leaves for oral administration). Brain delivery of the ginkgo compounds was assessed with microdialysis. Various rat samples were analysed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. KEY RESULTS: Slow terminal elimination features of the flavonols counterbalanced the influence of poor oral bioavailability on their systemic exposure levels, which also resulted in significant accumulation of the compounds in plasma during the subchronic treatment with ShuXueNing injection and GBE50. Unlike the flavonols, the terpene lactones had poor enterohepatic circulation due to their rapid renal excretion and unknown metabolism. The flavonol glycosides occurred as major forms in plasma after dosing with ShuXueNing injection, while the flavonol aglycone conjugates were predominant in plasma after dosing with GBE50. Cerebral exposure was negligible for the flavonols and low for the terpene lactones. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Unlike the significant systemic exposure levels, the levels of cerebral exposure to the flavonols and terpene lactones are low. The elimination kinetic differences between the two classes of ginkgo compounds influence their relative systemic exposure levels. The information gained is relevant to linking ginkgo administration to the medicinal effects.",

After treatment, HP-treated and untreated samples were frozen (diced onion, HP-treated). Subsequently, part of the diced samples was freeze-dried and pulverized (pulverized onion, HP-treated and freeze-dried). Flavonol content and anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities (hyaluronidase inhibiting activity, NO(•), ABTS(•+), and DPPH(•) scavenging capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and antioxidative capacity by photochemiluminescence) were measured in nonhydrolyzed and hydrolyzed extracts. Hydrolysis was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of HPP and HPP-FD-P on both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of extracts mainly containing aglycone forms. HPP-FD-P increased quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside, quercetin 4'-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucoside, and isorhamnetin 3,4'-diglucoside extractability. The present study suggests that HPP (especially treatment at 400 MPa) and HPP-FD-P may be of benefit for obtaining functional ingredients from onion, as suggested by increased NO(•) scavenging capacity and maintenance of the antioxidant activity mainly in hydrolyzed extracts.",

However, little is known about the molecular interactions between cisplatin and flavonols. The data herein helps to elucidate this interaction. Spectrophotometric data in the UV-visible range indicates that hydroxyl groups on the B-ring of flavonols are essential for reactivity with cisplatin. The use of a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring approach clearly supports the critical role played by B-ring hydroxyls in their interactions with a cisplatin-bound double-stranded DNA surface; an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups on the B-ring of flavonols parallels the increase in their reaction rates with cisplatin and correlates well with their reported effects on leukemia cell apoptosis efficacy. This study underscores the importance of B-ring hydroxyls in cisplatin's toxicity and may be used to better understand and improve combination therapies of flavonols with cisplatin.",

Abscisic acid (ABA) is one of most important phytohormones. It functions in various processes during the plant lifecycle. Previous studies indicate that ABA has a negative effect on root growth and branching. Auxin is another key plant growth regulator that plays an essential role in plant growth and development. In contrast to ABA, auxin is a positive regulator of root growth and development at low concentrations. This study was performed to help understand whether flavonoids can suppress the effect of ABA on lateral root growth. The recessive TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA 1 (ttg1) mutant was characterized on ABA and sucrose treatments. It was determined that auxin mobilization could be altered by modifying flavonoids biosynthesis, which resulted in alterations of root architecture in response to ABA treatment. Moreover, transgenic TTG1-overexpression (TTG1-OX) seedlings exhibited enhanced root length and lateral root number compared to wild-type seedlings grown under normal or stress conditions. Genetic manipulation of the flavonoids biosynthetic pathway could therefore be employed successfully for the improvement of plant root systems by overcoming the inhibition of ABA and some abiotic stresses.",

      "abstract": "Polyamine biosynthesis enzymes are promising drug targets for the treatment of leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease and African sleeping sickness. Arginase, which is a metallohydrolase, is the first enzyme involved in polyamine biosynthesis and converts arginine into ornithine and urea. Ornithine is used in the polyamine pathway that is essential for cell proliferation and ROS detoxification by trypanothione. The flavonols quercetin and quercitrin have been described as antitrypanosomal and antileishmanial compounds, and their ability to inhibit arginase was tested in this work. We characterized the inhibition of recombinant arginase from Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis by quercetin, quercitrin and isoquercitrin. The IC(50) values for quercetin, quercitrin and isoquercitrin were estimated to be 3.8, 10 and 4.3 μM, respectively. Quercetin is a mixed inhibitor, whereas quercitrin and isoquercitrin are uncompetitive inhibitors of L. (L.) amazonensis arginase. Quercetin interacts with the substrate l-arginine and the cofactor Mn(2+) at pH 9.6, whereas quercitrin and isoquercitrin do not interact with the enzyme's cofactor or substrate. Docking analysis of these flavonols suggests that the cathecol group of the three compounds interact with Asp129, which is involved in metal bridge formation for the cofactors Mn(A)(2+) and Mn(B)(2+) in the active site of arginase. These results help to elucidate the mechanism of action of leishmanicidal flavonols and offer new perspectives for drug design against Leishmania infection based on interactions between arginase and flavones.",

In this article, a comparison of the anxiolytic activity of the flavonols kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin in the elevated plus maze after oral (po) and intraperitoneal (ip) administration to mice in a dose range of 0.1 to 2.0 mg/kg is presented. In addition, their corresponding metabolites p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p-HPAA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were tested after intraperitoneal administration. Anxiolytic activity was detected for kaempferol and quercetin only after oral administration. No anxiolytic effects were observed when kaempferol and quercetin were given via the intraperitoneal administration route. The corresponding hydroxyphenylacetic metabolites p-HPAA and DOPAC showed anxiolytic effects after intraperitoneal application. In order to further test the hypothesis that flavonoids are possible prodrugs which require activation by intestinal bacteria, gut sterilization was performed using pretreatment with the antibiotic enrofloxacin (7.5 mg/day, po, for 4 days). After antibiotic treatment, the anxiolytic effect of kaempferol and quercetin disappeared, whereas it was still present for the positive control diazepam. Our results support the hypothesis that flavonoids act as prodrugs which are transformed into their active hydroxyphenylacetic acid metabolites by intestinal microflora.",

Inhibitory activity of liposomal flavonols on reactive oxygen species generation was assessed in vitro using luminol-H(2)O(2)-horseradish peroxidase technique. Antioxidant activity of liposomal flavonols is dependent on concentration and chemical structure of active compound. Quercetin and myricetin are the most active flavonols (IC(50) = 0.6-0.9 µmol/L), followed by kaempferol (IC(50) = 3.0-4.5 µmol/L) and galangin (IC(50) = 4.0-7.0 µmol/L).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of genes encoding cytokines may influence flavonol-induced changes in cytokine expression and consequently cancer risk. Using logistic regression, we estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between SNPs of interleukin (IL)-1β, 6, 8, and 10 alone or combined with flavonol intake or serum IL concentration changes, and adenoma recurrence in 808 participants from the intervention arm of the Polyp Prevention Trial, a 4-year intervention study evaluating the effectiveness of a low-fat, high-fiber, high-fruit and vegetable diet on adenoma recurrence. Overall, SNPs in genes encoding IL-1β, 6, 8, and 10 were not associated with their corresponding serum concentrations or adenoma recurrence. However, individuals homozygous for IL-10 -592 C (OR=2.23, 95% CI: 1.07-4.66, P(interaction)=0.03) orIL-10 -819 C (OR=2.18, 95% CI: 1.05-4.51, P(interaction)=0.05) had an elevated risk of high-risk adenoma recurrence when their serum IL-10 concentrations increased during the trial. In addition, IL-6 -174 GG in combination with above median flavonol intake (OR=0.14, 95% CI: 0.03-0.66) or with decreased IL-6 concentrations (OR=0.14, 95% CI: 0.03-0.65) reduced the risk of advanced adenoma recurrence, although the interaction term was not statistically significant. In conclusion, our results suggest that IL SNPs, in combination with a flavonol-rich diet or decreased serum IL, may lower the risk of adenoma recurrence.",

With no guidelines for dietary restrictions prior to the test, we hypothesize that consumption of flavonol-rich foods (such as onions, tomatoes, tea) prior to urinary catecholamine screening could be responsible for false-positive urinary HVA in healthy subjects. METHODS: A randomized, crossover dietary intervention was carried out in healthy subjects (n=17). Volunteers followed either a low or high-flavonol diet, for a duration of 3 days, prior to providing a 24-h urine sample for HVA measurement using a routine, validated liquid chromatography method as well as a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. RESULTS: Dietary flavonol intake significantly increased urinary HVA excretion (p < 0.001), with 3 out of 17 volunteers (20%) exceeding the 40 μmol/24 h upper limit of normal for HVA excretion (false-positive result). CONCLUSION: Dietary flavonols commonly found in foodstuff such as tomatoes, onions, and tea, interfered with the routine urinary HVA screening test and should be avoided in the three-day run-up to the test.",

In addition to their anti-oxidant effect, flavonols interfere with a large number of biochemical signaling pathways and, therefore, physiological and pathological processes. There is solid evidence that, in vitro, quercetin and related flavonols exert endothelium-independent vasodilator effects, protective effect on nitric oxide and endothelial function under conditions of oxidative stress, platelet antiaggregant effects, inhibition of LDL oxidation, reduction of adhesion molecules and other inflammatory markers and prevention of neuronal oxidative and inflammatory damage. The metabolites of quercetin show partial protective effects on endothelial function and LDL oxidation. Quercetin produces undisputed antihypertensive and antiatherogenic effects, prevents endothelial dysfunction and protects the myocardium from ischemic damage. It has no clear effects on serum lipid profile and on insulin resistance. Human intervention trials with isolated flavonols demonstrate an antihypertensive effect. The meta-analysis of epidemiological studies show an inverse association between flavonol (together with flavone) intake and coronary heart disease and stroke. Therefore, although there is no solid proof yet, a substantial body of evidence suggests that quercetin may prevent the most common forms of cardiovascular disease contributing to the protective effects afforded by fruits and vegetables.",

Flavonols, which can be found in fruits and vegetables, may inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis partly by inhibiting inflammation. We estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to determine whether serum IL-6 was associated with colorectal adenoma recurrence and flavonol intake and thus may serve as a risk indicator and as a response indicator to dietary flavonols. Serum IL-6 concentrations at baseline, year 1, and year 3 were measured in 872 participants from the intervention arm of the Polyp Prevention Trial, a 4-year trial that examined the effectiveness of a low-fat, high-fiber, high-fruit and vegetable diet on adenoma recurrence. Intake of flavonols, especially of isorhamnetin, kaempferol, and quercetin, was inversely associated with serum IL-6 concentrations (highest versus lowest flavonol intake quartile, 1.80 versus 2.20 pg/mL) and high-risk (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.98) and advanced adenoma recurrence (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.06-0.50). A decrease in IL-6 concentration during the trial was inversely associated with high-risk (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23-0.84) and advanced adenoma recurrence (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.19-1.18). Individuals with above median flavonol intake and equal or below median IL-6 change after baseline had the lowest risk of recurrence of high-risk and advanced adenoma.

Association of side effect and herbal-drug interaction with conventional anti-depressant and St. John's wort warrant investigating new anti-depressant drugs. Anti-depressant effects of ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) have been demonstrated in animal models of depression and in human volunteers. We report here that ginkgo flavonols quercetin and kaempferol stimulates depression-related signaling pathways involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF/phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein CREB/postsynaptic density proteins PSD95, and reduces amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in neurons isolated from double transgenic AD mouse (TgAPPswe/PS1e9). In addition, enhanced BDNF expression and reduction of Abeta oligomers was confirmed in hippocampus of the double transgenic mice administered with flavonol, which correlates with cognitive improvement behaviors in these mice. The present results suggest that stimulating BDNF and reducing Abeta toxicity by natural flavonols provide a therapeutic implication for treatment of AD.",

This investigation was designed to examine (1) bifenthrin as an inducer of oxidative stress in human erythrocytes in vitro through effects on catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and (2) the role of the flavonoids quercetin (Q, 40 and 80microM) and rutin (R, 80microM) in alleviating the effects of bifenthrin. Erythrocytes were divided into portions. The first portion was incubated for 4h at 37 degrees C with different concentrations (0, 42.2, 211, 1055ppm) of bifenthrin. The other portions were preincubated with Q or R for 30min, followed incubation with bifenthrin for 4h. The influence of solvent (ethanol) was also checked on the parameters studied. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, CAT and SOD activities were measured in all treatment portions of erythrocytes. Our results demonstrated that bifenthrin-induced oxidative stress causes enhanced lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidative enzyme activities in human peripheral blood. R pretreated erythrocytes were protected against the increase of MDA induced by bifenthrin. Q (80microM) and R pretreated erythrocytes were protected against the inhibition of CAT activity induced by bifenthrin. The protective action against the inhibition of SOD activity of Q was greater than that of R at the same concentration. These results suggest that Q and R may play a role in reducing bifenthrin-induced oxidative stress in vitro.",

Although this is generally attributed to resveratrol, the protective mechanisms and the active substance(s) remain unclear. We examined whether and how red wine extract (RWE) and red wine flavonols quercetin and myricetin inhibited 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-induced apoptosis of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. RWE attenuated HNE-induced PC12 cell death in a dose-dependent manner. HNE induced cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is involved in DNA repair in the nucleus, and this was inhibited by RWE treatment. Treatment with RWE also inhibited HNE-induced nuclear condensation in PC12 cells. Data of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate showed that RWE protected against apoptosis of PC12 cells by attenuating intracellular reactive oxygen species. The cytoprotective effects on HNE-induced cell death were stronger for quercetin and myricetin than for resveratrol. HNE-induced nuclear condensation was attenuated by quercetin and myricetin. These results suggest that the neuroprotective potential of red wine is attributable to flavonols rather than to resveratrol.",

The results of MTT assay showed that flavones (luteolin, apigenin, chrysin) and flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin) were able to induce cytotoxicity in KYSE-510 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the cytotoxic potency of these compounds was in the order of: luteolin>quercetin>chrysin>kaempferol>apigenin>myricetin. Flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation analysis indicated that the cytotoxicity induced by flavones and flavonols was mediated by G(2)/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, the expression of genes related to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was assessed by oligonucleotide microarray, real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. It was shown that the treatment of KYSE-510 cells with these compounds caused G(2)/M arrest through up-regulation of p21(waf1) and down-regulation of cyclin B1 at the mRNA and protein levels, and induced p53-independent mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis through up-regulation of PIG3 and cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The results of western blot analysis further showed that increases of p63 and p73 protein translation or stability might be contributed to the regulation of p21(waf1), cyclin B1 and PIG3.",

RESULTS: Compared to the placebo, the consumption of SBB increased the plasma concentration of the flavonols quercetin and isorhamnetin significantly [treatment differences 3.0 ng/ml (P = 0.03) and 3.9 ng/ml (P < 0.01), respectively]. The increase of kaempferol concentration was not significant [treatment difference 0.7 ng/ml (P = 0.08)]. SBB did not affect the serum total, HDL, LDL cholesterol, or the serum triacylglycerol concentrations. There was no correlation between the changes in flavonol and CRP concentrations of participants. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of SBB significantly increased the fasting plasma concentration of quercetin and isorhamnetin indicating that it is a good dietary source of flavonols. However, this did not convert to affecting the circulating concentrations of lipid markers in healthy, normolipidemic adults having healthy diets.",

      "abstract": "Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children, is a highly metastatic disease, with up to 30% of children having evidence of disseminated disease at presentation. Recently, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor, the tyrosine kinase Met, have emerged as key components of human medulloblastoma growth and metastasis, suggesting that inhibition of this pathway may represent an attractive target for the prevention and treatment of this disease. Using immunoblotting procedures, we observed that the dietary-derived flavonols quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin inhibited HGF/Met signaling in a medulloblastoma cell line (DAOY), preventing the formation of actin-rich membrane ruffles and resulting in the inhibition of Met-induced cell migration in Boyden chambers. Furthermore, quercetin and kaempferol also strongly diminished HGF-mediated Akt activation. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of quercetin on the tyrosine kinase receptor Met [half-maximal inhibitory effect (IC(50)) of 12 micromol/L] or on the Met-induced activation of Akt (IC(50) of 2.5 micromol/L) occurred at concentrations achievable through dietary approaches. These results highlight quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin as dietary-derived inhibitors of Met activity and suggest that this inhibitory effect may contribute to the chemopreventive properties of these molecules.",

      "abstract": "Flavonoids play critical roles in legume-rhizobium symbiosis. However, the role of individual flavonoid compounds in this process has not yet been clearly established. We silenced different flavonoid-biosynthesis enzymes to generate transgenic Medicago truncatula roots with different flavonoid profiles. Silencing of chalcone synthase, the key entry-point enzyme for flavonoid biosynthesis led to flavonoid-deficient roots. Silencing of isoflavone synthase and flavone synthase led to roots deficient for a subset of flavonoids, isoflavonoids (formononetin and biochanin A) and flavones (7,4'-dihydroxyflavone), respectively. When tested for nodulation by Sinorhizobium meliloti, flavonoid-deficient roots had a near complete loss of nodulation, whereas flavone-deficient roots had reduced nodulation. Isoflavone-deficient roots nodulated normally, suggesting that isoflavones might not play a critical role in M. truncatula nodulation, even though they are the most abundant root flavonoids. Supplementation of flavone-deficient roots with 7, 4'-dihydroxyflavone, a major inducer of S. meliloti nod genes, completely restored nodulation. However, the same treatment did not restore nodulation in flavonoid-deficient roots, suggesting that other non-nod gene-inducing flavonoid compounds are also critical to nodulation. Supplementation of roots with the flavonol kaempferol (an inhibitor of auxin transport), in combination with the use of flavone pre-treated S. meliloti cells, completely restored nodulation in flavonoid-deficient roots. In addition, S. meliloti cells constitutively producing Nod factors were able to nodulate flavone-deficient roots, but not flavonoid-deficient roots. These observations indicated that flavones might act as internal inducers of rhizobial nod genes, and that flavonols might act as auxin transport regulators during nodulation. Both these roles of flavonoids appear critical for symbiosis in M. truncatula.",

DiOHF exhibits antioxidant and vasorelaxant properties that are thought to underlie its cardioprotective activity. A major limitation to its use for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease is its poor water solubility, preventing intravenous administration at the required dosage. In this study, three novel flavonols were synthesised that bear an ionisable succinamic acid substituent at the 6-position of the A ring with zero, one, or two hydroxy groups on the B ring. The ionised compounds possess improved aqueous solubility, dissolving at concentrations up to 10(-1) m, whereas DiOHF is insoluble in water (<10(-7) m). Pharmacological analysis revealed that the DiOHF-6-succinamic acid derivative was the best antioxidant, possessing activity similar to DiOHF, whereas vasorelaxant activity was attenuated. This compound was able to effectively scavenge superoxide from the autoxidation of pyrogallol, preventing oxidant-induced endothelial dysfunction. DiOHF-6-succinamic acid represents the first antioxidant flavonol that lacks vasorelaxant activity and in the future will enable studies to cast light on the specific biological activity required for cardioprotection.",

Similarly, methyl ferulate increased the content of feruloylated KDG 40-fold. Treatment with methyl coumarate resulted in the appearance of a coumaroylated derivative of quercetin-3-O-glucuronyl-glucoside (QGGA). When the feeding studies were repeated with the equivalent phenylpropanoid isosubstituted with fluorine groups a semi-synthetic 4-fluorocinnamoyl ester of QGGA was observed.

In our study, cytotoxic effects of structurally related flavones and flavonols on a human oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell line (OE33) were compared, and the molecular mechanisms responsible for their cytotoxic effects were explored. The results of MTT assay showed that flavones (luteolin, apigenin, chrysin) and flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin) were all able to induce cytotoxicity in OE33 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the cytotoxic potency of these compounds was in the order of quercetin>luteolin>chrysin>kaempferol>apigenin>myricetin. Flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation analysis indicated that the cytotoxicity induced by flavones and flavonols was mediated by G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, the expression of genes related to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was assessed by oligonucleotide microarray, real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. It was found that the treatment of OE33 cells with flavones and flavonols caused G2/M arrest through up-regulation of GADD45beta and 14-3-3sigma and down-regulation of cyclin B1 at the mRNA and protein levels, and induced p53-independent mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis through up-regulation of PIG3 and cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The results of western blot analysis further showed that increases of p63 and p73 protein translation or stability might be contribute to the regulation of GADD45beta, 14-3-3sigma, cyclin B1 and PIG3.",

Like all vasoactive flavonols reported to date, DiOHF is both relaxant and antioxidant, hindering investigation of the relative contribution of each activity for the prevention of reperfusion injury. This study investigates structure-activity relationships of variations at the 3' and 4' positions of the B ring of DiOHF and vasorelaxant and antioxidant activities. Relaxation of rat isolated aortic rings precontracted with KCl revealed that the most active flavonols were those with a 4'-hydroxyl group, with the opening of potassium channels as a possible contributing mechanism. For the antioxidant activity, with the exception of DiOHF, none of the flavonols investigated were able to significantly scavenge superoxide radical, and none of the three most potent vasorelaxant flavonols could prevent oxidant-induced endothelial dysfunction. The discovery of single-acting vasorelaxant flavonols without antioxidant activity, in particular 4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyflavonol, will assist in investigating the mechanism of flavonol-induced cardioprotection.",

Consequently, inhibition of BACE-1, a rate-limiting enzyme in the production of Abeta, is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD. In this study, we discovered that natural flavonoids act as non-peptidic BACE-1 inhibitors and potently inhibit BACE-1 activity and reduce the level of secreted Abeta in primary cortical neurons. In addition, we demonstrated the calculated docking poses of flavonoids to BACE-1 and revealed the interactions of flavonoids with the BACE-1 catalytic center. We firstly revealed novel pharmacophore features of flavonoids by using cell-free, cell-based and in silico docking studies.

HPLC/electrospray ionization multi-stage mass spectrometry (ESI-MS(n)) was used for the structural characterization of the compounds produced. The influence of the degradation of the phenolic compounds on their antioxidant properties was elucidated by a electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry study of the reaction samples mixed with the stabilized radical, Fremy's salt. Strong degradation of the model substances took place under weak basic and oxidative conditions. Quercetin showed the most intense degradation. Protocatechuic acid could be identified as a cleavage reaction product by analyzing its retention time and molar mass during the degradation of quercetin. The structure of a second cleavage product could be identified on the basis of ESI-MS(n) fragmentation data. Also, several structures for reaction products of oxidized quercetin are suggested. The ESR analysis showed a decrease in the antioxidant activity of the reaction samples after heat treatment in aqueous solution.",

The relaxant responses and ability of the flavones/flavonols to inhibit phenylephrine (PE)- and Ca-induced contraction was determined in rat isolated thoracic aorta. The ability of these compounds to reduce the level of superoxide and preserve endothelium-dependent relaxation in the presence of oxidative stress was also examined. Four compounds impaired contraction to PE or Ca, in the potency order 3'-hydroxyflavonol>3',4'-dihydroxyflavonol>7,4'-dihydroxyflavonol>3',4'-dihydroxyflavone. Flavonol, 3',4'-dimethoxyflavonol, and flavone were significantly less active. The flavonoids caused concentration-dependent reductions in superoxide produced by rat aorta in the presence of NADPH. The most active compounds, 3',4'-dihydroxyflavonol and 7,4'-dihydroxyflavonol, preserved endothelium-dependent relaxation in the presence of oxidative stress caused by pyrogallol or xanthine/xanthine oxidase. The results indicate that the catechol group is not critical for vascular relaxant or antioxidant activity, but rather, the important determinants for higher vascular and antioxidant activity of these compounds are the presence of a C3 OH group and the total number of OH substituents, respectively. These results have allowed the identification of the structural characteristics that promote vascular and antioxidant activity of flavonols, which may lead to the development of agents useful in treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

Flavonoids are naturally occurring polyphenolic plant compounds, one group of which -- the flavonols, inhibits histamine and some cytokine release from rodent basophils and mast cells. However, the effect of flavonols on proinflammatory mediator release and their possible mechanism of action in human mast cells is not well defined. Human umbilical cord blood-derived cultured mast cells (hCBMCs) grown in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin (IL)-6 were preincubated for 15 min with the flavonols quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin and morin (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 microM), followed by activation with anti-IgE. Secretion was quantitated for IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), histamine and tryptase levels. Release of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha was inhibited by 82-93% at 100 microM quercetin and kaempferol, and 31-70% by myricetin and morin. Tryptase release was inhibited by 79-96% at 100 microM quercetin, kampferol and myricetin, but only 39% by morin; histamine release was inhibited 52-77% by the first three flavonols, but only 28% by morin. These flavonols suppressed intracellular calcium ion elevations in a dose-response manner, with morin being the weakest; they also inhibited phosphorylation of the calcium-insensitive protein kinase C theta (PKC theta). Flavonol inhibition of IgE-mediated proinflammatory mediator release from hCBMCs may be due to inhibition of intracellular calcium influx and PKC theta signaling. Flavonols may therefore be suitable for the treatment of allergic and inflammatory diseases.",

Flavonols have long held an interest for nutritionists, which has increased following a Dutch study in the early 1990's showing that dietary intake of flavonols was inversely correlated with the incidence of coronary heart disease. The main factors that have hindered workers in the field of flavonol research are (i) the accurate measurement of these compounds in foods and biological samples, and (ii) a dearth of information on their absorption and metabolism. This review aims to highlight the work of the authors in attempting to clarify the situation. The sensitive and selective HPLC procedure to identify and quantify common flavonols and their sugar conjugates is described. In addition, the results of an on-going screening program into the flavonol content of common produce and beverages are presented. The bioavailability of dietary flavonols is discussed with reference to an intervention study with onions, as well as pilot studies with tea, red wine and cherry tomatoes. It is concluded that flavonols are absorbable and accumulate in plasma and that consuming high flavonol-containing varieties of fruits and vegetables and particular types of beverages could increase their circulatory levels.",

Epidemiological studies indicating that high dietary intake of flavonols reduces the risk of mortality due to coronary heart disease have provoked interest in the mechanism of this cardioprotective effect. 2. We have investigated the structure-activity relationships of a range of flavonols and flavones with regard to their vascular relaxant and anti-oxidant activity. In rat isolated thoracic aorta, the synthetic flavonol 3',4'-dihydroxyflavonol (DiOHF) was found to be a significantly more potent vasorelaxant than the naturally occurring compounds chrysin, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin and fisetin. Similarly, DiOHF was significantly more potent than those compounds in the inhibition of calcium-induced contraction of the rat aorta. 3. 3',4'-Dihydroxyflavonol was also found to significantly inhibit superoxide radical generation in a cell-free system in the presence of xanthine/xanthine oxidase or by rat isolated aorta in the presence of NADPH. In the presence of oxidant stress generated by pyrogallol or xanthine/xanthine oxidase, endothelium-dependent relaxation of rat aortic rings was impaired. 3',4'-Dihydroxyflavonol was able to significantly improve endothelium-dependent relaxation in the presence of those oxygen radical generators. 4. In addition, DiOHF was found to significantly improve dilatation in the rat hindquarters vasculature after exposure to ischaemia and reperfusion. 3',4'-Dihydroxyflavonol was found to be equally effective whether applied before ischaemia or during ischaemia just before reperfusion. 5. In conclusion, DiOHF is an effective vasodilator and anti-oxidant that is able to prevent vascular reperfusion injury. We suggest that DiOHF may be useful as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy in the management of reperfusion injury.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with cancer prevention; flavonoids are widely distributed in plant foods and considered to be the active ingredients. Quercetin and kaempferol are two of the most commonly found dietary flavonols, and have been reported to prevent cancer. We have previously reported that the isoflavone genistein and the flavone baicalein exert differential actions on the oestrogen receptor (OR) alpha in HepG2 cells. Because of the structural resemblance to both isoflavone and flavone, we examined the effects of these dietary flavonols on ORalpha- and ORbeta-specific transactivations and their subsequent involvement in inducing MCF-7 cell death. In the present study, both quercetin and kaempferol were able to compete for OR binding in a cell-free system and were agonistic to ORalpha and -beta expressed in HepG2 cells, while some additive effect was observed in the oestrogen response element (ORE)-driven transcription when 17beta-oestradiol was co-administered. Since the bcl-2 promoter contained two ORE, and ORE-driven transcriptional activity and Bcl-2 mRNA expression were increased by treatment with 10 microm-quercetin or kaempferol, it is possible that quercetin and kaempferol might up-regulate Bcl-2 expression through OR transactivation in MCF-7 cells. Cell death ELISA assay performed on MCF-7 cells indicated that an increase of apoptosis occurred at 25 microm-, but not 10 microm-, quercetin or kaempferol. Indirectly the results suggest that OR activation is not sufficient to induce apoptosis and that apoptosis is induced despite an increase in Bcl-2 expression.",

      "abstract": "Many plant-derived substances have estrogenic activities. Due to their ability to bind the estrogen receptor (ER), these compounds have the potential to counteract the deleterious effects of estrogen deficiency on bone. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effect of two widespread flavonols, quercetin and kaempferol, on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in MG-63 cultured human osteoblasts. We found that both flavonols significantly increased ALP activity. This effect was markedly reduced by PD 98059, an inhibitor of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, and by ICI 182780, an antagonist of ERs. Western blot studies confirmed that ERK is rapidly activated in cells treated by both flavonols. Finally, ICI 182780 markedly inhibits the flavonol-induced ERK activation. The data presented in this study support the conclusion that, in MG-63 osteoblasts (i) the increase in ALP activity by flavonols involves a rapid stimulation of ERK activation but also involves the ER, and that (ii) the activation of ERK by flavonols occurs most likely downstream of the ERs activation. Taken together, these results suggest that flavonols derivatives as quercetin and kaempferol can stimulate osteoblastic activity. Such compounds may represent new pharmacological tools for the treatment of osteoporosis.",

      "abstract": "Trichomes excrete secondary metabolites that may alter the chemical composition of the leaf surface, reducing damage caused by herbivores, pathogens and abiotic stresses. We examined the surface exudates produced by Nicotiana attenuata Torr. Ex Wats., a plant known to contain and secrete a number of secondary metabolites that are toxic or a deterrent to herbivorous insects. Extractions specific to the leaf surface, the trichomes, and the laminar components demonstrated the localization of particular compounds. Diterpene glycosides occurred exclusively in leaf mesophyll, whereas nicotine was found in both the trichomes and mesophyll. Neither rutin nor nicotine was found on the leaf surface. Quercetin and 7 methylated derivatives were found in the glandular trichomes and appeared to be excreted onto the leaf surface. We examined the elicitation of these flavonols on the leaf surface with a surface-area allometric analysis, which measures changes in metabolites independent of the effects of leaf expansion. The flavonols responded differently to wounding, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), herbivore attack and UV-C radiation, and the response patterns corresponded to their compound-specific allometries. Finding greater amounts of quercetin on younger leaves and reduced amounts after herbivore feeding and MeJA treatment, we hypothesized that quercetin may function as an attractant, helping the insects locate a preferred feeding site. Consistent with this hypothesis, mirids (Tupiocoris notatus) were found more often on mature leaves sprayed with quercetin at a concentration typical of young leaves than on unsupplemented mature leaves. The composition of metabolites on the leaf surface of N. attenuata changes throughout leaf development and in response to herbivore attack or environmental stress, and these changes are mediated in part by responses of the glandular trichomes.",

Two major flavonols in the diet are quercetin and kaempferol, and their main sources in The Netherlands are tea and onions. We investigated whether plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of quercetin and kaempferol in humans could be used as biomarkers of intake. We provided 15 subjects with strong black tea (1600 mL/d) or fried onions (129 g/d) for 3 d each in random order separated by a 4-d washout period. The tea provided 49 mg quercetin and 27 mg kaempferol daily and the onions provided 13 mg quercetin and no kaempferol. Flavonols from both foods were clearly absorbed. However, the excretion of unmodified quercetin was 0.5% of intake after tea and 1.1% after onions. Thus, the absorption of quercetin from tea was half of that from onions. The onion treatment was repeated 7-14 d later to estimate within-subject CVs as a measure of reproducibility when the same treatment is given twice. CVs for quercetin were 30% in plasma and 42% in urine. The magnitude of these variations relative to actual variations of approximately 60% between free-living subjects indicates that concentrations of quercetin in plasma and urine are applicable as biomarkers of its intake. We conclude that flavonols in plasma and urine reflect short-term flavonol intake and that they could be used as biomarkers to distinguish between high and low flavonol consumption in epidemiologic studies.",

Hesperetin dihydrochalcone and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, at p.o. doses of 100-1000 mg/kg, did not increase the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow erythrocytes 6 h after the second of 2 doses 24 h apart, nor did rhamnetin at 48 or 96 h after a single i.p. dose of 1000 mg/kg. Galangin, in contrast, did significantly increase the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow and blood erythrocytes under certain conditions, but the largest increases were only between 2 and 3 times control values and these were observed at highly toxic doses. Rabbits given up to 250 mg/kg quercetin i.p. showed no treatment-related increase in the sister-chromatid-exchange frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes sampled at 1 and 7 days after treatment. These results fail to confirm published data which report a markedly increased frequency of micronuclei in bone marrow erythrocytes from quercetin-treated mice, show no quercetin-related alterations in the sister-chromatid-exchange frequency in rabbit lymphocytes, and indicate that clastogenesis in bone marrow erythroblasts due to oral or i.p. administration of the flavonols studied is at most very weak.",

      "abstract": "The genotoxicity of selected flavonols was evaluated by multiple endpoints in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Chromosomal aberrations, sister-chromatid exchange (SCE), and forward mutation at 4 gene loci were measured in a single population of cells exposed to quercetin, kaempferol, or galangin for 15 h with and without metabolic activation. The incidence of chromosomal aberrations was significantly increased by quercetin in the absence of activation and by kaempferol and galangin with and without activation. Flavonol treatment affected SCE and mutation at the hgprt, aprt, or Na+/K+-ATPase loci only marginally, but significantly increased mutation frequencies at the tk locus. The response at the tk locus suggests that the CHO cells may behave similarly to L5178Y cells, in which the tk locus is thought to reflect chromosomal lesions in addition to point mutation. These results indicate that, at least under the conditions examined, flavonols induce chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells, but have little effect on point mutation or SCE.",
