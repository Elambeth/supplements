      "abstract": "Chilling temperatures represent a challenge for crop species originating from warm geographical areas. In this situation, biostimulants serve as an eco-friendly resource to mitigate cold stress in crops. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is an economically important vegetable crop, but quite sensitive to cold stress, which it encounters in both open field and greenhouse settings. In this study, the biostimulant effect of a brown-seaweed extract (BSE) has been evaluated in tomato exposed to low temperature. To assess the product effects, physiological and molecular characterizations were conducted. Under cold stress conditions, stomatal conductance, net photosynthesis, and yield were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher in BSE-treated plants compared to the untreated ones. A global transcriptomic survey after BSE application revealed the impact of the BSE treatment on genes leading to key responses to cold stress. This was highlighted by the significantly enriched GO categories relative to proline (GO:0006560), flavonoids (GO:0009812, GO:0009813), and chlorophyll (GO:0015994). Molecular data were integrated by biochemical analysis showing that the BSE treatment causes greater proline, polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, and carotenoids contents.The study highlighted the role of antioxidant molecules to enhance tomato tolerance to low temperature mediated by BSE-based biostimulant."

      "abstract": "The molecular and phenotypic effects of a brown seaweed extract (BSE) were assessed in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Transcript levels of BSE-treated and untreated plants were studied by RNA-seq and validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (RT-qPCR). Root morphology, sugar yield, and processing quality traits were also analyzed to better elucidate the treatment effects. RNA-seq revealed 1019 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the BSE-treated and untreated plants. An adjusted p-value < 0.1 and an absolute value of log2 (fold change) greater than one was used as criteria to select the DEGs. Gene ontology (GO) identified hormone pathways as an enriched biological process. Six DEGs involved in auxin and ABA pathways were validated using RT-qPCR. The phenotypic characterization indicated that BSE treatment led to a significant increase (p < 0.05) in total root length and the length of fine roots of plants grown under hydroponics conditions. The sugar yield of plants grown under field conditions was higher (p < 0.05) in the treated field plots compared with the control treatment, without impacting the processing quality. Our study unveiled the relevant effects of BSE application in regulating auxin- and ABA-related gene expression and critical traits related to sugar beet development and yield."

      "abstract": "Eicosapolyenoic fatty acids are integral components of oomycete pathogens that can act as microbe-associated molecular patterns to induce disease resistance in plants. Defense-inducing eicosapolyenoic fatty acids include arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid and are strong elicitors in solanaceous plants, with bioactivity in other plant families. Similarly, extracts of a brown seaweed, Ascophyllum nodosum, used in sustainable agriculture as a biostimulant of plant growth, may also induce disease resistance. A. nodosum, similar to other macroalgae, is rich in eicosapolyenoic fatty acids, which comprise as much as 25% of total fatty acid composition. We investigated the response of roots and leaves from AA or a commercial A. nodosum extract (ANE) on root-treated tomatoes via RNA sequencing, phytohormone profiling, and disease assays. AA and ANE significantly altered transcriptional profiles relative to control plants, inducing numerous defense-related genes with both substantial overlap and differences in gene expression patterns. Root treatment with AA and, to a lesser extent, ANE also altered both salicylic acid and jasmonic acid levels while inducing local and systemic resistance to oomycete and bacterial pathogen challenge. Thus, our study highlights overlap in both local and systemic defense induced by AA and ANE, with potential for inducing broad-spectrum resistance against pathogens.

      "abstract": "Tomatoes (Lycopersicun esculentum L.) are an important group of vegetable crops that have high economical and nutritional value. The use of fertilizers and appropriate substrates is one of the important strategies that can assist in increasing the yield and quality of fruits. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of exogenous seaweed extract (Nizamuddinia zanardinii), silicon (Na2SiO3), and selenium (Na2SeO3) on quality attributes and fruit yield (FY) of tomato under palm peat + perlite and coco peat + perlite substrates. Seaweed extract significantly improved several of the fruit quality attributes such as total carbohydrate content, total soluble solids (TSS), and pH as well as the FY. The results showed that silicon (Si) (75 mg) was the best foliar spray treatment to enhance the fruit firmness (30.46 N), fruit volume (196.8 cm3), and FY (3320.5 g). The highest amount of plant yield (3429.33 g) was obtained by the interaction effects of silicon (75 mg L-1) under the effect of palm peat. The use of selenium (Se) led to improvements in flavor index (TSS/TA). Also, the application of palm peat + perlite substrate caused an increase in vitamin C (16.62 mg/100g FW), compared to other substrates (14.27 mg/100g FW). The present study suggested that foliar spray with seaweed extract and Si had beneficial effects on the quality and FY of tomatoes. Also, the palm peat substrate can be used as a good alternative to the coco peat substrate in the hydroponic system.",

      "abstract": "Ingredients of brown seaweed like fucoidans are often described for their beneficial biological effects, that might be interesting for a medical application. In this study, we tested an extract from Dictyosiphon foeniculaceus (DF) to evaluate the effects in glioblastoma and uveal melanoma, looking for a possible anti-cancer treatment. We investigated toxicity, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) secretion and gene expression of tumor and non-tumor cells. SVGA (human fetal astrocytes), the human RPE (retinal pigment epithelium) cell line ARPE-19, the tumor cell line OMM-1 (human uveal melanoma), and two different human primary glioblastoma cultures (116-14 and 118-14) were used. Tests for cell viability were conducted with MTS-Assay (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium), and the proliferation rate was determined with cell counting. VEGF secretion was assessed with ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). The gene expression of VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and VEGF-A was determined with real-time qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction). DF lowered the cell viability of OMM-1. Proliferation rates of ARPE-19 and OMM-1 were decreased. The VEGF secretion was inhibited in ARPE-19 and OMM-1, whereas it was increased in SVGA and 116-14. The expression of VEGFR1 was absent and not influenced in OMM-1 and ARPE-19. VEGFR2 expression was lowered in 116-14 after 24 h, whereas VEGF-A was increased in 118-14 after 72 h. The extract lowered cell viability slightly and was anti-proliferative depending on the cell type investigated. VEGF was heterogeneously affected. The results in glioblastoma were not promising, but the anti-tumor properties in OMM-1 could make them interesting for further research concerning cancer diseases in the human eye.",
