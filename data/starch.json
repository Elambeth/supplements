      "abstract": "The increasing presence of tetracycline antibiotics in aquatic ecosystems poses a critical environmental challenge, necessitating innovative remediation strategies. This study presents the development and characterization of starch-functionalized iron-graphene oxide (SFIGO) and starch-functionalized iron oxide (SFIO) nanocomposites adsorbents for tetracycline removal from water, with emphasis on sustainable synthesis and enhanced performance. Biluochun tea and cassava extract were used as renewable precursors in green synthesis to create a composite material that combines iron oxide's magnetic properties, graphene oxide's high surface area, and starch's biocompatibility. Comprehensive characterization using FTIR, XRD, SEM-EDX, TEM, and XPS revealed SFIGO's unique hierarchical architecture, featuring wrinkled graphene oxide sheets with well-dispersed iron-oxide nanoparticles. Batch adsorption studies demonstrated SFIGO's superior performance, achieving a maximum adsorption capacity of 865.79 mg/g at 298 K, significantly higher than SFIO's 634.83 mg/g. The adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and showed endothermic behavior, with negative Gibbs free energy values, confirming process spontaneity. Multiple binding mechanisms, including π-π interactions, electrostatic attractions, and surface complexation, contributed to SFIGO's enhanced performance. The material demonstrated robust performance across various water matrices and maintained high removal efficiency. These findings advance our understanding of composite materials in environmental remediation and provide a sustainable solution for pharmaceutical pollutant removal."

      "abstract": "Chinese chestnuts are high in starch, and becomes rapidly digestible after cooking, which increases the risk of blood glucose level disorders. In this study, a catechin-chestnut starch complex (CC-CS) was prepared using high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). The findings revealed that the complexation rate of complex prepared using HHP was 68.83 %. Compared with that of chestnut starch (CS), the solubility and swelling power of 600 MPa-6 % complex increased by 18.13 % and 4.14 %, respectively. Conversely, the freeze-thaw stability showed a decline of 16.48 %, whereas the resistant starch exhibited an increase of 39.93 %; consequently, HHP treatment reduced the digestibility of complex. The long-range ordered structure was disrupted, and the relative crystallinity diminished. The enthalpy change (ΔH) decreased, and complex showed typical weak gel behavior. In conclusion, HHP facilitates the formation of complex and enhances the physicochemical properties and anti-digestibility of chestnut products, thus aiding in the development of high-quality, low-digestibility starch-based foods."

      "abstract": "Resistant starch (RS) is recognized as a nutritional strategy that supports gut and overall host health by modulating gut microbiota. To directly assess the effects of RS on gut microbiota and its role in improving intestinal barrier function in meat ducks, this study first established an antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis model, which was characterized by reduced gut microbial diversity, intestinal dysfunction, and an inflammatory outburst following antibiotic exposure. Whereafter, in addition to the control group, ducks treated with antibiotics for 7 consecutive days were further allocated to two groups and fed the basal diet and RS diet that derived from 12 % raw potato starch until 21 d. The results demonstrated that dietary RS supplementation reversed the antibiotic-induced reduction in microbial diversity and restored the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio. Additionally, RS inclusion enriched beneficial bacterial genera, including Coprobacter, Odoribacter, and Faecalibacterium (LDA score > 3). Post-antibiotic intervention led to a reduction in villus density and muscular thickness, accompanied by a significant downregulation (P < 0.05) of zonula occludens-1 and mucin-2 expression, along with increased serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (P < 0.05). Notably, dietary RS supplementation significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) the expression of glucagon-like peptide receptor and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2, while suppressing caspase transcription. This resulted in increased villus height and muscular thickness in the ileum (P < 0.05). Furthermore, RS intervention remarkably reduced (P < 0.05) pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, particularly interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, in both the ileum and serum. These effects were likely linked to alterations in cecal microbiota, including increased abundances of Barnesiella, Ruminiclostridium 9, Megamonas, Faecalitalea, Adlercreutzia, Coprobacter and Collinsella. In conclusion, dietary RS supplementation mitigated antibiotic-induced cecal microbial dysbiosis and restored intestinal structure by promoting enterocyte proliferation and reducing apoptosis. Consequently, RS supplementation helped alleviate systemic inflammation in meat ducks following antibiotic treatment."

This study explored the effects of high-temperature (30 min, 121 °C) and high-humidity treatments on the starch properties and digestibility of infant purees made from wheat, rice, and maize. Purees were prepared using whole grains (WGs), whole grain flours (WGFs), and flour suspensions (FSs) subjected to thermal treatment. Untreated whole grain samples from each cereal served as controls. Samples were analyzed for microstructure, thermal properties, viscosity, and starch digestibility. Microstructural analysis revealed partial to complete loss of amyloplast birefringence, particularly in FS. The thermal treatment reduced peak viscosity in WGs, WGFs, and FSs. Also, the flour suspensions showed lower thermal stability and a phytic acid content reduction of 30%. In vitro digestion revealed a significant reduction in total hydrolyzed starch (THS) in wheat- (27.8 g/100 g starch) and maize- (11.3 g/100 g starch) WG purees compared to controls. In contrast, WGF purees showed significant increases in THS: 29% (wheat), 70% (rice), and 92% (maize). FS purees also showed significant increases in THS (57.4, 39.3, and 45.4 g/100 g starch for wheat, rice, and maize, respectively), alongside a decrease in resistant starch. In conclusion, thermal treatment modulates starch digestibility and viscosity properties in a cereal-dependent manner, offering a potential approach to optimize infant nutrition."

      "abstract": "Although resistant starch (RS) isolated from raw starch exhibits established regulatory effects on the mouse gut microbiota and associated hyperlipidemia, critical questions persist regarding RS in heated foods - the predominant form in the human diets, namely, the role of RS from heated food in the regulation of hyperlipidemia through gut microbiota is still unclear. This study evaluated the effects of a RS (jackfruit heated resistant starch, JFRS3) from heat-treated jackfruit native starch (JFNS) on hyperlipidemia in golden hamster gut microbes. Compared with JFNS, JFRS3 developed an irregular block-like shape with numerous grooves, exhibited more ordered structures (R1047/1022: 2.952 and R1022/995: 0.964) and greater crystallinity (relative crystallinity (RC): 21.96 %), and transformed into a C-type crystalline structure. Additionally, JFRS3 demonstrated significant antihyperlipidemic effects, which included an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels (4.36 mmol/L) and reductions in triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (14.39, 4.55, and 4.61 mmol/L, respectively), thereby alleviating liver fatty lesions, reducing fat accumulation, and inhibiting adipocyte enlargement. These effects were closely linked to intestinal microbial changes, such as specific microbial enrichment and enhanced gut microbial diversity, potentially influenced by the structural properties of JFRS3. Furthermore, the consumption of JFRS3 was more effective in slowing weight gain and improving blood lipid profiles compared with raw RS present in JFNS. These findings prove that JFRS3 modulates hyperlipidemia induced by a high-fat diet and contributes to the development of alternative strategies for managing high-fat-diet-associated hyperlipidemia."

The isolated EFYS was subjected to the plasma treatment at varying voltages (190 V, 210, V and 230 V) for 5, 10 and 15 min of exposure. The control and treated starches were analysed for pH, amylose content, carboxyl group, paste clarity, water and oil binding property, pasting property, DSC, FTIR, XRD and SEM. There has been a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in pH values of starch from 7.22 to 4.92 and also reduction in turbidity values by 32.48 %. Plasma treatment improved paste clarity and storage stability. However, a significant increase was observed in the oil (1.26-3.80 g/g) and water binding capacity (1.47-1.91 g/g) of the starch. The structural modification, including surface etching, has been confirmed by FTIR and SEM analysis. Plasma treatment significantly increased starch crystallinity, which correlated with higher gelatinization enthalpy, indicating enhanced thermal stability due to plasma induced crosslinking. FTIR data confirmed that cross-linking takes place in samples treated at lower voltages (190Vand 210 V) followed by depolymerization occurring in harshly treated plasma samples (230 V for 15 min)."

Comprehensive database searches identified eight RCTs (1739 patients) published between 2000 and 2024. No significant differences were found in overall postoperative complications [RR 1.04 (95 ​% CI 0.90-1.20); p ​= ​0.59], including renal, cardiovascular, respiratory complications, or mortality. However, BSS required significantly higher intraoperative fluid volumes [SMD 0.61 (95 ​% CI 0.42-0.80); p ​< ​0.001] and led to greater postoperative fluid balance [SMD 0.39 (95 ​% CI 0.20-0.59); p ​< ​0.001]. 6 ​% HES should not be used routinely.

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of ultrasound treatment on the physicochemical properties and thermal stability of durian starch. Durian starch samples were subjected to ultrasound at 20 kHz and 500 W for 2 min. The treatment significantly increased the starch extraction yield by 14.55% compared to untreated starch. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that ultrasound treatment induced physical modifications in the starch granules, including the formation of cracks and pores, which likely contributed to the enhanced extraction efficiency and influenced the starch's gelation behavior. Thermal analysis, including differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, demonstrated that ultrasound-treated starch exhibited higher thermal stability compared to native starch. The thermogravimetric analysis results indicated a lower weight loss at high temperatures (70.39% for ultrasound-treated starch versus 79.55% for native starch at 596 °C). The heat flow during thermal decomposition was reduced in ultrasound-treated starch, suggesting that the treatment induced structural modifications that strengthened the gel matrix and improved resistance to thermal degradation. Additionally, ultrasound treatment enhanced the functional properties of durian starch, including swelling power, solubility, and water absorption capacity, which are critical for hydrogel formation and food-grade gel applications. These findings highlight the potential of ultrasound-treated durian starch for advanced applications in food hydrogels, biodegradable films, and gel-based delivery systems."

In this research, we looked into the effects of buckwheat resistant starch (BRS) supplementation on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in hyperlipidemic mice. Results showed that HBRS intervention significantly inhibited weight gain in high-fat diet mice, reducing body weight by 2.91 g versus MC group. Serum TC, TG, and LDL-C decreased by 74.25 %, 76.79 %, and 56.25 % respectively, while HDL-C increased by 67.66 %. HBRS mitigated hepatic steatosis and epididymal adipocyte hypertrophy. HBRS downregulated TNF-α and IL-6 by 24.4 % and 18.25 %, respectively, and upregulated IL-10 by 15.35 %. It modulated lipid metabolism genes by suppressing SREBP2, FAS, SCD1 and activating PPARα/CPT1. Moreover, BRS improved gut microbiota composition by lowering the F/B ratio and enhancing populations of SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, and Parabacteroides). BRS significantly increased the total levels of SCFAs in the gut. Compared to the MC group, HBRS resulted in increases of 40.2 %, 51.8 %, and 68.3 % in acetate, propionate, and butyrate, respectively. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BRS serves as a beneficial nutritional resource for the management of hyperlipidemia."

The results revealed that nanocomposite has a strong ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, and induce apoptosis via ROS- mediated mechanism. Molecular docking studies revealed strong interactions between chitosan, a key component of the nanocomposite, and cancer related protein osteocalcin, with a binding affinity of -12.6 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the biocompatibility of CS/S/SeNC was confirmed through its interaction with the endogenous protein Decorin, thereby augmenting its potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of bone cancer. These findings suggest that CS/S/SeNC has great potential for targeted cancer therapies."

Given that the optimal strategy for priming CPB in cardiac surgery remains a matter of debate, this study aimed to investigate the effects of albumin 20% and hydroxyethyl starch 6% as priming solutions on bleeding and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels during CPB. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial involved 40 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery at Shahid Chamran Hospital between July 2021 and July 2022. Participants were assigned to 2 groups: the first group received 50 mL of albumin 20% as the priming solution for the CPB circuit, while the second group received 500 mL of hydroxyethyl starch 6%. Bleeding and IL-6 levels were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The albumin group comprised 80.0% men and 20.0% women, with a mean age of 66.45±5.84 years. The hydroxyethyl starch 6% group consisted of 85.0% men and 15.0% women, with a mean age of 63.05±5.92 years (P>0.05). The findings revealed that 12 hours after CPB, the IL-6 level in the hydroxyethyl starch 6% group (mean: 171.6±77.71 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that in the albumin group (mean: 105.8±36.45 pg/mL; P=0.002). At 48 hours after CPB, the mean bleeding was not significantly different between the groups (P=0.950). CONCLUSION: Albumin 20% was more effective than hydroxyethyl starch 6% concerning IL-6 levels. However, no significant differences in bleeding were observed between the groups at 48 hours post-CPB."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of pre-heating temperatures (60-85 °C) and subsequent branching enzyme (BE) modification on green banana starch to modify its structural and functional properties. Pre-heating at 60-65 °C maintained granular integrity while enabling BE to increase α-1,6 linkages (5.2-8.4 %). At 70 °C, partial gelatinization facilitated greater BE access, resulting in amylose reduction (3.2 %) and maximum branch formation (10.4 %). Complete gelatinization at 75-85 °C eliminated Maltese crosses and maximized BE accessibility, producing amorphous structures with negligible amylose content (< 1.1 %). Both solubility and gel transmittance increased progressively with higher pre-heating temperatures, with completely gelatinized samples exhibiting the highest values. Chain-length distribution analysis revealed an increase in short chains (DP 6-12) with a concurrent decrease in longer chains across all the modified samples. In-vitro digestibility results demonstrated that BE-modified starches exhibited substantially increased slowly digestible and resistant starch content after cooking, particularly at higher temperatures. This approach offers a versatile strategy for producing banana starch ingredients with tailored structural, functional, and nutritional properties."

Its digestion is influenced by intrinsic structure and processing-induced changes at cellular level. This study investigated the effects of monovalent, divalent, and trivalent salts on cell-wall structure and in vitro digestion properties of intracellular starch. Whole peas were soaked in salt-solutions with pH ranging from highly-acidic (1.5-4.5) to alkaline (10-11) and cooked cotyledon cells were isolated. Alkaline salt treatment enhanced water absorption, cell separation, yield, starch digestion, and fluorescence, while reduced particle size, galacturonic acid, protein content, and gelatinization temperatures compared to slightly-acidic salt treatments. In contrast, highly-acidic salt treatments caused slight cell rupture, reduced water absorption, yield, and nutritional content but increased starch crystallinity, gelatinization temperatures, and digestion with increased fluorescence. These findings show that salt-induced pH modulation can regulate starch digestion, providing insights into dietary management and metabolic health."

      "abstract": "This study developed an innovative approach for wheat starch-gluten separation (i.e. ultrasound-assisted xylanase treatment, U-Xyl), aiming at enhancing separation efficiency and improving products' quality. Image analysis revealed that U-Xyl facilitated release of starch granules from gluten network as a result of arabinoxylan degradation. Higher amount of xylanase addition induced greater polymerization of gluten and better viscoelasticity. Also, it promoted the formation of β-sheet and α-helix. When the xylanase amount increased to 0.15 % (U-Xyl15), starch and gluten yields reached their summit (53.66 % and 10.85 %, respectively). Up to 2.44 mg/g water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) remained on isolated starch after U-Xyl15. This alleviated damage to the crystalline structure, amylose leaching, swelling power loss, and peak viscosity decrease. Owing to WEAX-starch interactions, U-Xyl15 enhanced the anti-retrogradation capacity of starch. Moreover, U-Xyl15 resulted in the highest gel strength (195.34 g). This paper could provide theoretical basis for industrial production of starch with desirable quality."

Unlike the conventional free enzyme pretreatment hydrolysis process, which randomly disrupts the starch structure, the α-amylase-inorganic hybrid nanoflower catalyst can selectively hydrolyze branched-chain starch, thereby exposing more concentrated reaction sites for subsequent esterification reaction. The resulting OSA-modified starch exhibits excellent emulsification and encapsulation properties, and the resultant Pickering emulsion demonstrates effective protection of the embedded active substances and Antarctic krill oil. After 15 days of storage, the particle size remains essentially unchanged. This work is expected to contribute to the development of a novel starch-based emulsifier for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries."

      "abstract": "Starch hydrolysates are syrups obtained through the hydrolysis of starch with a defined carbohydrate composition and concentration. Annual harvest conditions and the availability of raw materials, such as corn, wheat, rice, potato, and certain plant roots, influence their quality. High-quality starch hydrolysate products serve numerous applications, including ingredients in food, textiles, paper, cosmetics, bioplastics, pharmaceuticals and construction. However, impurities such as colour molecules, characteristic flavours, salts, and proteins encountered in the solution along the starch processing steps can compromise product quality. With increasing emphasis on organic and sustainable production, starch hydrolysates must meet higher health and environmental standards. This review provides a comprehensive overview of starch hydrolysates production and purification. It explores the chemical processes leading to the formation of impurities and their impact on the final product composition and specific characteristics. Downstream processing methods for recovery, purification, and concentration are also investigated, comparing traditional techniques with emerging membrane-based technologies. Membrane technologies offer a potential solution for purifying plant-based starch hydrolysates efficiently and sustainably by enhancing purification while reducing energy consumption and waste generation. They operate at lower temperatures, avoiding phase transitions, extra heating, chemicals, and solvent exchanges. Although membrane technologies are widely used in various food industries, minimal research exist on their applications in starch hydrolysate processing, with limited experimental validation available. Addressing this gap, this review compiles established applications and discusses challenges hindering industrial adoption-including membrane fouling, the selection of appropriate membranes, the operational lifespan, and replacement costs,- while also identifying areas requiring further experimental research and development.",

      "abstract": "High-amylose maize starch (HA) has gained attention due to its high resistant starch content. In this study, HA and wheat starch (WS) were blended in various ratios (WS-HA) to investigate their gelatinization characteristics, thermal properties, gel strength, molecular entanglement, and digestibility. The RVA tests affirmed the viscosity contribution of HA granules or molecules to WS-HA. The results of DSC show that the formation of amylose-lipid complexes (ALC) in the WS-HA was lower than the theoretical value. Molecular entanglement indicated that the molecule chains in WS-HA were more easily entangled compared to individual starches. The interaction between the starch chains decreased as the HA content increased. All samples underwent thermal treatment with RVA 4800 (100 °C and 140 °C), followed by freeze-drying and milling to obtain samples for subsequent digestibility evaluation. At 100 °C, the interaction between the ungelatinized HA granules and gelatinized WS molecules produced a stronger gel than the theoretical one, resulting in higher resistance to digestion. At 140 °C, it was found that all samples but 10 %HA showed more digestible results compared to the theoretical value. This research highlights the interactions of molecule-granule and molecule-molecule and the impact on gelatinization and digestibility in WS-HA, supporting the development of slow-digesting starch-based products."

Herein, a sustainable protocol was developed to prepare starch laurates (SLs) by combining ball milling mechanochemistry with a subsequent thermal treatment. By tuning reaction conditions, a series of thermoplastic SLs with degrees of substation (DS) of 1.8-2.7 and melting flow temperatures (Tflow) of 78-186 °C were realized, which can be easily shaped various products via a conventional hot-pressing technique. Besides, the synthesized SLs showed satisfactory water resistance, whose dumbbell-shaped products kept 77.8 % of their tensile strength after soaking in water (23 ± 2 °C) for 10 days. Furthermore, paper cups with high water resistance was fabricated from commercial printing papers that coated with SLs, which can retain water for 30 days without leakage. This work provided a sustainable strategy for preparing thermoplastic SLs with high water resistance."

The results indicate that MT significantly increased the complexation index (CI) of quercetin with corn starch from 36.08 % to 47.73 %. Structural and digestive properties were also investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that microwave-treated corn starch-quercetin complex (MT-CS-Q) formed a more compact complex than CS-Q. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed that MT-CS-Q exhibited a highly ordered structure, with the crystalline conformation of starch transitioning from A-type to A + V-type. Moreover, the dense structure formed by quercetin and starch after microwave treatment significantly reduced the in vitro digestibility of the complex, resistant starch content increased from 11.91 % to 19.06 % compared to the non-microwave treated complex. During simulated gastrointestinal digestion, MT-CS-Q reduced quercetin release in the stomach and increased its absorption in the intestine. These findings demonstrate that microwave treatment is an effective method for enhancing the CI of quercetin with corn starch. The results provide a theoretical basis for the development and utilization of functional starch."

Results showed that the destruction degree of HAMStarch in a water/ILi solution increased with increasing temperature. At 70 °C, the polarisation cross of HAMStarch completely disappeared and the short-range molecular order was significantly decreased. The formation of a V-type complex with lauric acid (LAc) enhanced the short-range molecular order of HAMStarch. Rheological measurements showed that the viscosity of the water/ILi solution decreased with increasing system temperature and increased with increasing cationic ACLen. However, the relative crystallinity (RC) of HAMStarch gradually decreased with increasing treatment temperature and ILi cationic ACLen. At 50 °C and 70 °C, when the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain was increased from 2 to 4, the diffraction peaks of the involved samples became stronger and sharper and the total melting enthalpy (ΔH) values gradually increased. The maximum RC (29.17 %) and ΔH (5.86 J/g) values of the HAMStarch-LAc complex were obtained when HAMStarch was pretreated by 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride at 70 °C."

      "abstract": "Chestnut is one of China's traditional export commodities in the international market and enjoys a positive reputation. Its key quality attributes are closely linked to changes in the physicochemical properties of chestnut starch after thermal processing. This study investigated the effects of different temperatures (100 °C, 160 °C, and 200 °C) and times (10, 20, and 30 min) of dry heat treatment (DHT) on the physicochemical and structural properties, as well as the functional properties of chestnut starch. The results demonstrated that DHT increased the solubility (S) and water absorption capacity (WAC), but reduced the swelling power (SP), transmittance, and gelatinization characteristics. DHT modified the starch's functional properties, increasing its digestibility. This was reflected in the rise in rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and the decline in resistant starch (RS) content. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that cracks, crevices, and pores appeared on the starch granule surfaces after DHT. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed that the relative crystallinity (RC) of starch decreased with higher temperatures and longer treatment times. The ability of DHT to alter the physicochemical and functional properties of starch provides foundational data for the possible modification of chestnut starch and its application in starch-based food products."

In this study, the impact of sonication on the techno-functional, thermal, structural, and rheological properties of a composite gluten-free flour was investigated. The flour, comprising corn starch, rice flour, and other ingredients, was treated at hydration levels of 15% and 25% (w/w) under controlled conditions (10 min of sonication at 20 °C) and compared to a non-sonicated control. Sonication reduced the water absorption capacity (WAC) and swelling power (SP) while increasing the oil absorption capacity (OAC) and water solubility (WSI). Thermal analysis revealed lower gelatinization enthalpy, indicating structural modifications induced by cavitation. Structural assessments (XRD and FTIR) confirmed minimal alterations in crystallinity and short-range order. Rheological studies demonstrated an enhanced elasticity in the gel structure, especially at 15% hydration, while a morphological analysis via SEM highlighted particle fragmentation and surface roughening. These findings demonstrate the potential of ultrasound to modify gluten-free flours for improved functionality and diverse applications in gluten-free product development."

      "abstract": "A substantial amount of seaweed waste, rich in plant-stimulating properties, holds great potential for composting. However, without proper catalysts or additives, composting and humification are slow and inefficient, causing carbon and nitrogen losses. This study explores a novel approach to enhance composting efficacy by coupling phosphate with high-carbon ferromanganese particles (HCFMP). The results indicate that the phosphate-HCFMP coupling promotes humus precursor transformation, as evidenced by dynamic changes in reducing sugars, amino acids, and polyphenols. Additionally, ultraviolet characteristic parameters and Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) analysis show that the coupled treatment improves both the rate and degree of humification. By the end of composting, this treatment exhibited the highest HA/FA (4.38), with the HA/FA on day 21 surpassing other treatments on day 35. While the phosphate-only group achieved a relatively high degree of humification, the process was slower and accompanied by substantial NH3 volatilization. The HCFMP-only group reduced NH3 emissions, but the oxidative performance of HCFMP was enhanced under lower pH conditions, reducing organic matter participation in humus formation. Compared to phosphate alone, the coupled treatment reduced NH3 emissions by 48.6% and increased nitrate content by 12%. Further analysis suggests that the enhancement mechanisms may include: (1) phosphate stimulating humus precursor production; (2) HCFMP mainly acting as a catalyst under higher pH to promote precursor polymerization; and (3) HCFMP's acidic sites adsorbing NH3/NH4+ and facilitating nitrification. In conclusion, coupling HCFMP with phosphate enhances composting efficacy, and the resulting products, with plant-stimulating properties, offer a feasible solution for sustainable green agriculture development.",

The oil and water absorption capacities of the porous starch increased by 14% and 27%, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry indicated a higher pasting temperature for the porous starch. This starch exhibited remarkable drug-carrying capabilities, absorbing up to 18.23 mg/g of proanthocyanidins and significantly shielding them from UV damage. In vitro release tests in simulated intestinal fluid revealed that the encapsulated proanthocyanidins (PC) achieved nearly complete release. These results underscore the potential of LS as a drug carrier and provide valuable insights for developing innovative intestinal drug delivery systems."

Flavonoids were significantly released by microwave (e.g. arbutin, eriodictyol-7-o-glucoside, narirutin, and naringenin-7-o-glucoside), which regulated the antioxidant activity of sorghum. Simulated co-gelatinization reaction revealed that polyphenols interacted non-covalently with starch, resulting in higher levels of polyphenols being retained during cooking (711.12 mg GAE/100 g). Molecular docking results exhibited that 6 flavonoids could also bind to the kafirin via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction during cooking. Meanwhile, the γ-mangostin also possessed stabilized root-mean-square deviation and outstanding binding free energies.

The films with acerola residue extract tended to intensify the yellowish color, while those with grape pomace extract showed more significant color changes varying from purple to green. Integrating natural pigments like anthocyanins from grape pomace and carotenoids from acerola improved the films' functional properties and provided a visual indication of food freshness through pH changes."

      "abstract": "The gravitropic growth of roots is crucial for plants to adapt to terrestrial environments and acquire nutrients from the soil. Tomatoes are a vital economic crop that requires abundant water and nutrients for growth and development. However, there are few reports on the regulatory mechanisms of tomato root gravitropism, particularly auxin-mediated root gravitropic growth. Here, we revealed the signaling pathway of auxin regulating tomato root gravity response through exogenous auxin and auxin inhibitor treatment combined with transcriptome profiling. Our data underscore the necessity of auxin biosynthesis, transport, and optimal levels for the gravitropic growth of tomato roots. Treatment with exogenous auxin or auxin biosynthesis inhibitors diminished gravitropic response in tomato roots. Conversely, treatment with an auxin transport inhibitor led to a robust agravitropic response. Furthermore, we observed that auxin controls root gravitropic growth by establishing concentration gradients and influences root perception of gravity signals by positively regulating starch granule accumulation. Treatment with the exogenous auxin NAA heightened starch synthesis, while exogenous application of the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor yucasin dampened starch synthesis in tomato roots. Our study observed a slow gravitropic response in cultivated cherry tomato (Aisheng) roots. Time series analysis showed that tomato roots bend toward gravity at a slower rate. Transcriptome analysis revealed that many (2770) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in roots following 36 h of gravity stimulation. In contrast, only 58 DEGs were detected after 3 h of gravity stimulation, further supporting the slow gravitropic response phenotype of tomato roots. GO and KEGG analysis highlighted auxin response, starch and sugar metabolism, and cell wall modification as the major regulatory pathways involved in the gravitropic response and growth of tomato roots. Our results indicate that auxin mediates root sensing of gravity signals through feedback regulation of starch accumulation and controls root gravitropic bending by regulating the expression of cell wall modification-related genes."

Nutrient starvation or abscisic acid (ABA) are known to affect growth and starch accumulation in duckweed. However, the joint effects of nutrient starvation and ABA on growth and starch accumulation in duckweed remain unknown. This study analyzed the response of duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) to nutrient starvation and ABA and the synergistic treatment of the two to examine the growth and starch accumulation of duckweed. Nutrient starvation and ABA can promote starch accumulation in both the frond and turion of duckweed as a result of the key enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity that was significantly increased in the starch synthesis pathway of duckweed. Nutrient starvation and ABA can induce the formation of turions with high starch content, which reached up to 38.3 ± 1.9% (dry weight). Further studies on the ultrastructure of the frond and dormant cell of duckweed found that nutrient starvation and ABA increased the number and size of starch grains in duckweed fronds and dormant cells. These results will provide a theoretical basis for duckweed and its turions as a potential renewable energy crop.",

Both ultrasound and thermal treatment are effective methods for preparing starch-CA complexes, but the two treatments have different effects on different starches. Characterization of the complexes prepared using the two methods showed that thermal treatment and ultrasound reduced the crystallinity of starch to some extent, with thermal treatment having a greater effect. Thermal treatment also reduced the amount of double-helix structures in starch. In contrast, ultrasound was relatively mild and had less effect on starch granular structure. However, these two methods promoted the binding of CA, thereby increasing the crystallinity of starch and forming a more ordered and compact structure, which, to some extent hindered the enzymatic degradation of starch. Moreover, the RDS of starch-CA complexes were reduced to different degrees, with the most significant changes in U (PS-CA) and T (CS-CA), which were reduced by 5.96 % and 4.55 %, respectively."

      "abstract": "This research aimed to investigate the effects of single and dual chemical modifications on the physicochemical, thermal, rheological, and digestibility properties of achira starch (NS). The single modification involved mild acid hydrolysis of NS with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid for 6 and 12 h. The dual modification was carried out in a starch slurry with octenyl succinic anhydride (3% starch-based) or citric acid (CA) (0.43 g/mL) after each hydrolysis treatment. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction analyses demonstrate that dual modification changed the structural organization of NS in a more significant way than single. The mass loss was reduced from 60.94% (NS) to 50.03% (modified starches). Water soluble index increased until 6.46 g/g, and swelling power revealed a dimished of 77.31% in comparison to NS. Modified starches' peak viscosity was significantly lower (from 0.43 Pa·s until imperceptible), attributed to starch chain hydrolysis and the incorporation of ester groups. The analysis of digestive properties revealed no significant impact on the slowly digestible starch (SDS) content among the uncooked samples. However, the dual modification with CA for 6 and 12 h significantly reduced rapidly digestible starch (from 80.87% to 18.62%) and SDS alongside increased resistant starch (from 13.91% to 79.80%). This study indicates that dual chemical modification produces more distinct changes to expand the application of starch in sauces, soups, frozen food, and dairy food. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: •Dual chemical modification through acid hydrolysis and citric acid esterification produced functionalized achira starches with high resistant starch content. •Dual chemical modification resulted in starches with enhanced thermal stability for thermally processed and frozen foods.",

The soft wheat varieties Quanmai 725 (QM725) and Yangmai 15 (YM15) were used as study materials under field conditions, and the experiments were conducted during 2022-2023. During the grain filling stage (7-35 days post anthesis), three shading levels were set: 10% shading (S1), 20% shading (S2) and 30% shading (S3), with natural light conditions used as the control (CK). In 2023-2024, two N application rates (120 kg/hm2 [N1] and 180 kg/hm2 [N2]) and the abovementioned three shading treatments for each N application rate were set during the filling stage. The effects of weak light treatment post anthesis on the grain yield and yield components of soft wheat were analyzed. Moreover, the mitigation effects of different N application rates on the grain yield and starch physicochemical characteristics of wheat were examined. The results showed that N application increased wheat yield and yield components as well as the content of starch and its components, whereas weak light treatment decreased these parameters under the same N application rate. Under N1 and N2 conditions, weak light treatment post anthesis significantly reduced the volume, surface area percentage and number of B-type starch granules (particle size ≤10 μm) and increased those of A-type starch granules (particle size >10 μm). Enhanced N application rates significantly improved the gelatinization characteristics and thermodynamic characteristics of wheat starch. Under the same conditions of N1 and N2, weak light treatment significantly reduced the gelatinization characteristics of wheat starch, such as peak viscosity, trough viscosity and final viscosity. Although the enthalpy of wheat starch was increased, its onset temperature, peak temperature and end temperature were significantly reduced, which affected the quality of wheat grains and eventually led to a decrease in wheat yield. However, enhanced N application rates increased the grain yield and starch physicochemical characteristics of wheat. Under the same N application rate, weak light treatment post anthesis reduced the content of starch and its components in wheat grains, which in turn affected the wheat grain weight. The effect was more pronounced in wheat B-type starch granules than in A-type starch granules."

It was found that the magnetic field treatment not only promoted amylose precipitation and molecular rearrangement in the starch but also significantly enhanced the viscoelastic properties, increased the elastic modulus, and adjusted the cross-link spacing. Additionally, the magnetic field increased the swelling power (from 11.84 to 12.52 g/g) and solubility (from 14.66 to 19.18 %) of SDPP-4 mT by weakening the structural integrity of the starch. It also disrupted glycoside bonds and facilitated the degradation of amylopectin into amylose, resulting in improved thermal properties, higher amylose content (25.46 %), reduced molecular weight, accumulation of short-chains, and a lower degree of branching (4.89 %). Besides, while the SDPP-4 mT group exhibited increased molecular structure orderliness, the starch granules experienced disintegration, leading to a reduction in particle size. The magnetic field also promoted short-chain formation and enhanced the structural order of the starch granules, correlating with increased viscosity and digestion resistance of the dough. In conclusion, magnetic field offers a promising approach for regulating the multi-scale structural of starch granules and mitigating the pasting and digestion properties of dough."

      "abstract": "Starch holds significant potential in food industry applications; however, its practical utility is hindered by several limitations, including freeze-thaw instability, shear sensitivity, insolubility in organic solvents, high retrogradation, and the instability of its gels and pastes. Ozonation, an eco-friendly modification technique, effectively addresses these challenges by oxidizing starch molecules, introducing carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups, and partially cleaving glycosidic bonds. These structural modifications enhance the functional, mechanical, and barrier properties of starch, making it a promising material for biodegradable food packaging films. Additionally, ozone treatment improves key physicochemical properties such as gelatinization behavior, pasting characteristics, crystallinity, solubility, and viscosity. This review explores the application of gaseous and aqueous ozone in modifying various starch sources, including cassava, wheat, rice, corn, sago, and potato starches. Furthermore, it delineates different ozone generation methods, such as corona discharge, dielectric barrier discharge, and microwave ultraviolet (UV) systems. The impact of ozonation on starch structure, its functionalization for packaging films, and the challenges associated with scaling up industrial ozonation processes are critically discussed. Finally, this review provides recommendations for optimizing ozone-based starch modification and advancing innovative ozone generation technologies to enhance industrial feasibility and sustainable packaging solutions."

XBS-WF was exposed to CP at 40 V for various durations. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Rapid Viscosity Analysis (RVA) revealed that CP treatment induced aggregation and cross-linking of starch and other molecules, leading to enhanced intermolecular interactions and improved starch crystallinity. In addition, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) showed enhanced thermal stability and increased enthalpy. Furthermore, CP treatment promoted the oxidation and cleavage of phenolic macromolecules into smaller, biologically active compounds, resulting in a notable increase in antioxidant and anticancer activities. These findings suggest that CP treatment can effectively improve the functional and qualitative properties of XBS-WF, particularly by modifying starch and phenolic macromolecules. This study provides a foundation for exploring the multiscale applications of the CP process on starch and phenolic macromolecules."

The modified starch's multiscale structure and physicochemical properties were characterized to understand the enhancing effects. Multiple freezing-thawing effectively enhanced carboxymethylation, benefitting from the gradually accumulated depressions, cracks, and pores on the surface of freezing-thawing-treated starch granules. The substitution degree and reaction efficiency of freezing-thawing treated starch ranged from 0.29 to 0.38 and 52.77 % to 63.92 %, respectively, compared to untreated starch (0.23; 43.58 %). A high carboxymethylation induced starch molecule degradation and crystalline structure disruption, as shown by depolymerization of long chains, and a loss of short-range ordered molecular and helical structures. These structural changes facilitated the interaction between carboxymethyl groups, water molecules, and amylose leaching. As a result, water solubility, paste transparency, retrogradation, and viscoelasticity were significantly improved. Freezing-thawing pretreatment provides a promising way to improve carboxymethyl starch's structure, properties, and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "After analyzing a high-quality 'Hongyang' genome, we identified 17 AcBAMs. Comprehensive bioinformatics were performed to elucidate the properties and evolutionary relationships of these genes. Our analysis revealed that most AcBAMs retained conserved active sites (e.g., Glu186 and Glu380) and exhibited similar structural properties. Phylogenetic and collinearity analyses grouped the genes into three main clusters, with segmental and tandem duplications contributing to their expansion. Expression profiling showed that AcBAM5 and AcBAM13 were most highly expressed during postharvest storage and were strongly induced by ABA signal. Silencing these genes led to a significant increase in starch content, suggesting their key role in starch degradation. Promoter analysis identified cis-elements related to ABA signal and cold response in the AcBAM family, and the expression of AcBAM genes was influenced by ABA and low-temperature treatments, with specific genes showing significant responsiveness.Background Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis cv. Hongyang) is a perennial woody fruit tree highly valued for its rich nutritional profile and high vitamin C content. The postharvest ripening process, characterized by starch degradation into soluble sugars, significantly influences the fruit's flavor and texture. β-amylase (BAM) has been proven to be one of the key enzymes catalyzing starch degradation, but which BAM genes are involved and how to participate in this process in kiwifruit still need to be clarified.Conclusion In the study, we identified a total of 17 AcBAM genes. The expansion of AcBAMs in kiwifruit was mainly due to segmental duplication events, and some of their catalytic residues were mutated, potentially leading to a loss of biological activity. The expression patterns of AcBAMs, along with VIGS data, suggest that AcBAM5 and AcBAM13 respond to ABA signals and promote starch degradation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms of BAM genes in kiwifruit and highlight their importance in starch metabolism and fruit ripening.",

Surimi samples with and without starch were processed using either microwave pasteurization or water bath, and water bath processed surimi without starch served as the control. Gel strength, texture, water-holding capacity (WHC), whiteness, water molecules distribution and mobility, protein secondary structure, and gel network were used to assess the gel properties and microstructure of the samples.

The increase in water content during ultrasound effectively enhanced the swelling power of BWS and reduced the peak viscosity. Besides, with the increase of water content and ultrasonic power, the crystallinity of BWS decreased significantly, and the formation of ordered structures was suppressed. In addition, after ultrasonic treatment, the particle size of BWS was decreased, and the surface became rough and concave. In short, ultrasonic treatment effectively improves the processability of BWS and provides a new theoretical basis for physical treatment in the production of cereal starch."

METHODS: One hundred and sixty newly weaned pigs at 7.0 ± 0.3 kg body weight (BW) were allotted in a 2 × 2 factorial with NSP sources and NSPases serving as factors. The 4 dietary treatments were: DDGS, corn distillers' dried grains with solubles as source of NSP; DDGS + NSPases (DDGS +), DDGS with xylanase at 0.01%, 3,000 U/kg of feed and β-mannanase at 0.05%, 400 U/kg of feed; SHWB, soybean hulls and wheat bran replacing corn DDGS as the source of NSP; SHWB with NSPases (SHWB +), SHWB with xylanase at 0.01%, 3,000 U/kg of feed and β-mannanase at 0.05%, 400 U/kg of feed. Pigs were fed for 37 d and housed in groups of 4 pigs per pen. At d 37, the median body weight pig in each pen was euthanized for sampling to analyze intestinal health parameters. Remaining pigs were fed a common diet for subsequent phases to evaluate the carryover effect on growth and carcass traits. RESULTS: The SHWB decreased (P < 0.05) the relative abundance of Helicobacter, tended to increase (P = 0.074) the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, increased (P < 0.05) immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the jejunal mucosa, tended to increase (P = 0.096) the villus height (VH) in the jejunum, and tended to improve ADG (P = 0.099) and feed efficiency (P = 0.068) during phase 1 compared to DDGS treatment. Supplementation of NSPases increased (P < 0.05) Shannon index of diversity, increased the relative abundance of Streptococcus and Acinetobacter, and tended to increase (P = 0.082) dry matter digestibility. The BW of pigs fed SHWB was more uniform (P < 0.05) at the end of the 120 d study. Additionally, hot carcass weight of pigs fed SHWB tended to be more uniform (P = 0.089) than DDGS treatment. CONCLUSION: Soybean hulls and wheat bran replacing DDGS in nursery diets improved uniformity of pigs at market weight, which might be attributed to beneficial modulation of the mucosa-associated microbiota and enhanced intestinal morphology during the nursery phase. Supplementation of NSPases had beneficial effects on the intestinal mucosa-associated microbiota, digestibility, and intestinal immunity in SHWB treatment, whereas no carryover effects were overserved at market weight."

      "abstract": "Early indica rice in Southern China frequently experiences high temperatures (HT) and strong light (SL) during grain filling, which accelerates grain maturity. In this study, two indica rice cultivars with different grain qualities under control (CK), HT, and HT + SL treatments to investigate their impacts on starch structure and physicochemical properties. The results demonstrated that HT and HT + SL treatments increased the amylopectin average chain length, long chain, relative crystallinity, large granule, and protein content (40.9 %-41.6 %), while decreasing amylose content (15.4 %-21.6 %) and branching degree compared to CK. This was due to a reduction in granule-bound starch synthase, soluble starch synthase, and starch branching enzymes, along with an increase in debranching enzyme activity, which altered the starch fine structure and diminished thermal stability and gelatinization viscosity. The HT + SL treatment exhibited a more pronounced impact, increasing the amylopectin middle chain (fb1) and relative crystallinity, while decreasing the branching degree and amylopectin short-chain length, indicating that SL exacerbated the deterioration of starch structure. Nevertheless, the starch physicochemical properties of high-quality cultivar were relatively less affected by the HT + SL conditions, suggesting a potential for improved utilization of starch in high-quality early indica rice in food processing."

      "abstract": "With the growth of the global population and increasing concern for environmental issues, the development of sustainable and eco-friendly materials has become increasingly important. Starch, as a renewable resource, is one of the most abundant polysaccharides in nature, with the advantages of good biocompatibility, high biodegradability, and low cost. Starch-based hydrogels (SBHs) have attracted widespread attention due to their unique physical and chemical properties. This article provides a comprehensive review of the latest research progress in SBHs, discussing their main characteristics, formation mechanisms, diverse applications, and future development trends. First, it outlines the biocompatibility, degradability, water absorption and retention, environmental responsiveness, and mechanical strength of SBHs. Then, it elaborates in detail on the formation mechanisms of SBHs, including physical crosslinking (hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, host-guest and coordination interactions), chemical crosslinking (such as initiators, heat, light, radiation, and click reactions), and synergistic effects. Subsequently, it analyzes the applications of SBHs in cutting-edge fields such as flexible sensors, medical dressings, drug delivery, tissue engineering, soil protection, wastewater treatment, and food packaging. Finally, it summarizes the challenges in current research and provides an outlook on future development trends, emphasizing the importance of further optimizing the performance of SBHs to meet broader industrial needs and environmental protection goals. This review not only provides a systematic theoretical framework for the study of SBHs but also charts a course for their innovative applications in the field of sustainable materials, playing a significant role in advancing the continuous development of this area."

      "abstract": "There is a big challenge in the efficient preparation of starch-unsaturated fatty acid (FA) complexes due to the steric hindrance of unsaturated FAs. This study aimed to understand the effects of debranching of high-amylose maize starch (HAMS) on the formation, structure and in vitro enzymic digestibility of complexes prepared with C18 unsaturated FAs. Debranching treatment of HAMS generated linear glucan chains and enhanced the encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of FAs, particularly for the treatment of 12 h. Meanwhile, debranching treatment, especially for 12 h, greatly enhanced the long- and short-range ordered structure as well as the thermal stability of complexes, and decreased the in vitro enzymic digestibility. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the van der Waals forces between amylose (AM) and stearic acid (SA) was stronger than those between AM and three unsaturated FAs, which may account for the higher degree of crystallite perfection of starch-SA complexes. Correlation analyses showed that the degree of crystallite perfection of the complexes was the main determinant for the rate and extent of complex digestion. Our study shows clearly that a certain degree of debranching can significantly promote the formation of starch-unsaturated FA complexes with higher degree of structural order and lower enzymic digestibility, which may be of interest for the efficient preparation of starch-unsaturated FA complexes to deliver health benefits.",

      "abstract": "The applications of hydrothermally modified starches in conventional water media, such as distilled water (DW), are limited due to their poor performance. Therefore, researchers are introducing innovative techniques in various environments, including ethanol solutions, salt solutions, acidic or alkaline conditions, plasma-activated water (PAW), and hydrogen-infused water (HW), to enhance the efficiency of annealing (ANN) and heat moisture treatment (HMT). The present review discusses these new approaches aimed at improving the performance of ANN and HMT, their potential mechanisms for starch modification, the resulting changes in the functional properties of starch, and their role in various food applications. Additionally, it systematically elucidates the challenges, opportunities, and future directions in this field. Unlike classical water-based ANN or HMT, innovative and sustainable approaches adopted for hydrothermal methods drastically enhance the structural stability, resistance to digestive enzymes, and low-temperature storage stability of starch. However, these changes depend on controlled parameters, such as the concentration of ethanol or salt, pH of the medium, incubation time, moisture level, treatment temperature, and starch properties (e.g., amylose/amylopectin ratio) during treatment. This consolidated report on cutting-edge techniques designed to enhance the effectiveness of hydrothermal modifications seeks to expand the potential applications of ANN and HMT in food-grade products.",

      "abstract": "Starch is a primary energy source of human diet. Its physicochemical properties and digestibility can be improved by incorporating exogenous protein. In this study, mung bean protein isolate was covalently crosslinked using transglutaminase and proanthocyanidin to create crosslinked mung bean protein isolate. This modified protein was combined with corn starch to form crosslinked mung bean protein isolate-corn starch composite samples. Results demonstrated that these composite samples exhibited superior physicochemical properties, including reduced swelling capacity, enhanced freeze-thaw stability, improved thermostability, and enhanced antioxidant properties. During in vitro digestion, the improved corn starch digestibility was attributed to two factors: first, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between crosslinked mung bean protein isolate and corn starch; and second, the synergistic crosslinking of transglutaminase and proanthocyanidin promoting the formation of a stable protein network of mung bean protein isolate, serving as a physical barrier to protect corn starch. After co-treatment with transglutaminase and proanthocyanidin, significant changes of mung bean protein isolate occurred in their secondary and tertiary structures, enhancing its protein network strength, thereby improving the physicochemical properties of corn starch. These findings propose a new strategy for reducing rapidly digestible starch and provide a theoretical foundation for developing low glycemic index starch foods.",

However, most of the current starch-based aerogels exhibited limitations, such as limited adsorption capacity and poor ability to selective treatment in complex dye wastewater. In this study, acrylic acid (AA) and allyl sulfonic acid sodium salt (AS) were grafted onto the carboxymethyl starch sodium (CMS) backbone via UV-induced radical polymerization, and combined with sulfonated activated carbon (SAC) to prepare a CAA/SAC starch-based aerogel with low density (0.29 g/cm3), high porosity (86.48 %), and notable swelling capacity (60.78 g/g). Activated carbon with porous structures was sulfonated with concentrated sulfuric acid to introduce -SO3H groups. These groups, along with the negative charges on CMS, AA, and AS, enable selective adsorption of cationic dyes. The adsorption capacity of CAA/SAC aerogel for the cationic dye methylene blue was 136.43 mg/g, which was significantly higher than that of the anionic dye methyl orange (69.31 mg/g). The adsorption process followed both pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm. The CAA/SAC aerogel can effectively remove dye molecules from wastewater, showing promising potential for various wastewater treatment applications."

The strategic incorporation of carboxymethyl moiety (-CH2COOH) onto the starch backbone confers a suite of physicochemical properties that markedly enhance its efficacy as a drug carrier. The carboxymethyl groups, with a pKa of approximately 4.5, exhibit pronounced pH-responsiveness, undergoing a transition from a predominantly deprotonated, hydrophilic state at physiological pH (7.4) to a more protonated form in the acidic tumor microenvironment (pH 6.5-6.8) facilitating targeted drug release at neoplastic site. The mucoadhesive attributes ascribable to carboxyl-mucin interactions, prolong gastrointestinal residence time for oral formulations, optimizing drug absorption. Furthermore, these functional groups serve as reactive sites for subsequent modifications, facilitating the development of multifunctional, targeted drug delivery systems with enhanced biocompatibility and minimized off-target effects. The versatility and biocompatibility of CMS position it as a promising platform for next-generation anticancer therapeutics, offering potential for significant advancements in oncological treatment modalities.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for 2 dietary buffers at different dosages to mitigate excessive intestinal fermentation and systemic inflammation due to hindgut acidosis. Ten ruminally cannulated lactating cows were randomly assigned to a replicated 5 × 5 Latin square with a 7-d adaptation period, 14-d experimental periods, and 7-d washout periods between each experimental period. Daily treatments during experimental periods were abomasal infusion of water without feeding supplemental buffer (control; CON), abomasal infusion of corn starch without feeding supplemental buffer (IS), or abomasal infusion of starch with 150 g/d of buffer A (calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, and crushed oyster shell blend; T1), 300 g/d of buffer A (T2), or 150 g/d of buffer B (magnesium oxide; T3). Daily abomasal starch infusions were 2 g/kg BW in period 1 and 4 g/kg BW in periods 2 to 5, and were split into 2 bolus infusions provided every 12 h during the 14-d experimental periods. Cows were fed a 30.9% starch TMR (on a DM basis), and 1 cow was removed from the study between periods 1 and 2. Although not intended, the high-starch TMR seemed to induce SARA, as evidenced by mean rumen pH of 5.8 to 6.0. Compared with CON, abomasal corn starch addition decreased fecal pH (6.80 vs. 6.37) and apparent total-tract starch digestibility (95.6% vs. 86.1%). Starch infusion did not increase serum acute phase proteins, and effects on fecal LPS and total fecal VFA concentrations were modest, suggesting that infused starch was only partially digested. Buffer additions increased fecal pH as expected (mean of 6.76 for T1, T2, and T3, respectively), but also increased fecal acetate (64.0 mM for IS compared with a mean of 74.5 mM for T1, T2, and T3, respectively) and total VFA concentration (81.5 mM for IS compared with a mean of 100.1 mM for T1, T2, and T3, respectively), suggesting that they may have increased hindgut fermentation. Additionally, the T2 treatment may have had an inflammatory effect, as evidenced by increased serum amyloid A compared with IS (71.5 vs. 22.0 µM, respectively). Despite increased fecal pH, the inclusion of different buffer formulations in a high-starch diet seemed to increase hindgut fermentation, as evidenced by increased VFA concentration. The buffers employed in this experiment did not alleviate the negative effects of abomasal starch infusions and, in the case of T2, may have presented a challenge.",

Current work aims at exploring how paozhi treatment tailors the composite behavior and physicochemical properties of coix seed starch-oils mixtures system, through inspecting the interactions between starch and oils under simulated sand frying conditions. The results indicate that processing induces significant morphological changes, leading to the formation of a porous starch-like structure. During this process, oils interact with starch molecules, facilitating the reorganization of the starch matrix and the formation of starch-lipid complexes (V-type inclusion complexes) as well as starch-lipid aggregates (oil is physically trapped). These structural changes, in conjunction with the interactions between water and oil, enhance the gelatinization properties and promote the slowly digestible characteristics of the sand-fried coix seed system, resulting in a gradual release of oil components. This study provides a foundation for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying the processing of starch-rich medicinal and food crops and their implications for health and nutrition."

In addition, with more in-depth studies in the preparation and formation reason of RS, the current classification of RS may not satisfy our current understanding of RS. In this paper, a new classification of RS is proposed. RS is classified into 10 types from two aspects (reparation methods and formation reasons), which may make it easier to understand the different RS. This paper may provide a reference for the research of RS."

This study revealed that the addition of α-amylase significantly increased the amylose content (p < 0.05), resulting in an amylose content of 80.91 % when the α-amylase addition rate was 1 U/g. Moreover, this has a specific effect on the structure and characteristics of RS5. In this work, the experimental assessment of the complex index (CI) suggests that the CI value is purely observational data with no discernible correlation to other data. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed that the presence of α-amylase increased the relative crystallinity of RS5 (at 1 U/g, 36.03 %). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses revealed that the presence of α-amylase increased the stability of the double helices (at 1 U/g, 1022/995: 0.92). The RS content was 37.91 % when the amount of α-amylase added was 1 U/g. The RS content was 37.91 % when the amount of α-amylase added was 1 U/g. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Mastersizer analysis revealed that α-amylase has a notable effect on the observable morphology and microstructure of RS5. The specific surface area of RS5 first tended to decrease but then tended to increase with the addition of α-amylase (p < 0.05). Analysis of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TG) data revealed that RS5 has greater thermal stability than does CS. The mechanism of the α-amylase synergistic autoclaving debranching method for the preparation of RS5 was analyzed.

      "abstract": "Starch is a safe biopolymer, whose use for the production of scaffolds intended for deep wounds treatment is limited, due to its low mechanical and thermal properties. For this reason, until now, it has been used in low amounts and/or in combination with other biopolymers. The aim of the study was to produce thermoplastic filaments (TPS) with high starch content, useful for scaffolds production by Fusion Deposition Modelling 3D printing technique. TPS was obtained by hot melt extrusion from a mixture of starch (70 % w/w) and glycerol (30 % w/w) combined to cationic clay montmorillonite, citric acid and magnesium stearate to improve strength and processability. The prepared scaffold was characterized and compared to other two scaffolds, where the effect of the addition of polycaprolactone (PCL) or methylsulphonylmethane (MSM) (as thermostable model drug) to the blend was evaluated. The mechanical properties were investigated by Brillouin Light Scattering. In vitro studies highlighted that the scaffolds are: i) able to absorb simulated exudates (reaching a hydration of 35 % in 7 days); ii) safe on keratinocytes (viability > 70 %) stimulating their growth; iii) able to inhibit S. pyogenes growth.",

Herein, we developed selenium-loaded octenyl succinic anhydride starch (OSAS) micelles functionalized with folic acid (FA) for targeted tumor delivery. The FA-OSAS-SeNPs were synthesized through self-assembly, incorporating SeNPs into FA-conjugated OSAS micelles. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and UV-visible spectrophotometry confirmed the successful synthesis of FA-OSAS-SeNPs. The nanoparticles exhibited an average size of 131.66 ± 7.88 nm and a zeta potential of -19.54 ± 0.33 mV, with encapsulation efficiency and drug loading capacity of approximately 87.28 % and 8.96 %, respectively. FA-OSAS-SeNPs demonstrated good stability across various conditions, including different dilution ratios, temperatures, pH levels, and ionic strengths. In vitro studies showed that FA-OSAS-SeNPs exhibited significant targeted inhibitory effects on cervical cancer (HeLa) cells and markedly increased intracellular ROS levels, inducing apoptosis. This study presents a novel and effective strategy for targeted SeNPs delivery systems in tumor therapy, offering a valuable reference for future development of nanomaterials for clinical applications in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that starch-lipid complexation can significantly impact gut health via the formation of V-type resistant starch. This study used varying microwave (MW) power levels (600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 W) to prepare V-type lotus-seed starch (LS)-palmitic acid (PA) complexes and investigates their multi-scale structural and thermal properties. The results indicate that MWs promote hydrophobic LS-PA complexation to form a B + V6II-type crystalline structure, with the V-type complexation rate found to positively correlate with MW power. Specifically, a higher MW power is more conducive to guiding the evolution of the disordered structure in the complex system back to the ordered arrangement and enhancing the crystallinity and stability of the system. The evolution of this V-type crystallization process peaks at an MW power of 1000 W MW to afford a complexing index of 55.409 %. Further thermal-property analyses reveal that the V-type complexed starch is mainly arranged as highly thermally stable accumulated single-helix structures that dissociate at 100-105 °C. These findings provide valuable data for regulating V-type complex formation through MW treatment and establish a theoretical foundation for precisely designing healthy starch-based foods."

The changes in starch's multi-scale structure and the underlying mechanisms were also elucidated. The introduction of microwave significantly enhanced the hydrolysis efficiency of potato starch and reduced amylose content, thereby decreasing both the storage modulus and loss modulus. Texture profile analysis indicated that the anti-retrogradation ability of MP improved by 5 % of BHMW, compared to the traditional water bath enzymatic hydrolysis (BHWB). During simulated reheating, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, particle size distribution analysis, and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the starch structure was more susceptible to disruption under microwave reheating conditions. Furthermore, enzymatic hydrolysis induced further degradation of starch's crystalline structure. In the retrogradation process, MP treated with BHWB exhibited a 2.17 % increase in crystallinity, a significant change corroborated by variations in retrogradation enthalpy measured via differential scanning calorimetry.",

Manpo rice flour, which is high in amylose, demonstrated higher peak viscosity compared to flours from medium-high amylose rice (Hommali rice), under the same treatment conditions. The reduction in swelling power observed after ANN and HMT treatment in both varieties corresponds with the pasting behaviors of these flours. All samples exhibited notable shear-thinning properties. Pregel samples exhibited rapid digestion, with the maximum RDS levels reaching 35.4 % for Manpo rice and 37.3 % for Hommali rice. While, the structure of US samples changed, resulting in enhanced polyphenol bioaccessibility and decreased digestion rate. The lowest eGI recorded in US samples was 60.7 for Manpo rice and 61.5 for Hommali rice, with polyphenol bioaccessibility at 180 min measured at 37 % and 28.8 %, respectively.

Developing high-performance, cost-effective, and sustainable electrode materials represents a significant challenge for starch-based supercapacitors. Therefore, this study eliminates the high cost associated with the traditional high-dose KOH activation process by employing a combined approach of pre‑carbonization and low-dose KOH activation to produce interconnected honeycomb-like porous carbon. Rational pre‑carbonization treatment fractures starch macromolecules, and the migration, rearrangement, and cross-linking of carbon atoms result in a loosened structure that facilitates uniform absorption of low doses KOH. The resulting interconnected porous carbon network possesses a reasonable mesopore volume and specific surface area, exhibiting an ultrahigh capacitance of 346 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and a capacitance retention rate of 64 % at 80 A g-1. In the assembled symmetric supercapacitors, the energy density reaches up to 9.2 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 250 W kg-1. The low-dose KOH activation method proposed in this study offers a viable pathway for commercializing starch-based porous carbon supercapacitors with high energy density."

Morphological analysis revealed that pectin uniformly coated starch granules, forming protective layers and rearranging crystalline structures. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed alterations in molecular order, with increases in single-helix structures and reductions in double-helix structures. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry highlighted significant reductions in crystallinity and changes in thermal properties, indicating compact structural arrangements. Pasting and in vitro digestibility results revealed HT-C/P@60/80 exhibiting the highest resistant starch content and the lowest rapidly digestible starch content. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations demonstrated that pectin binds to α-amylase, then potentially inhibiting its catalytic activity. These findings highlight the role of pectin in altering starch properties for better food applications."

This study explores the effects of cooked rice starch on glycometabolism in rats to explore the role of high glycemic index (GI) carbohydrates in the daily diet. Utilizing X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy allowed the structure of amorphous starch to be probed, while rats were subjected to a long-term pre-prandial gavage intervention (glucose as a positive control and normal saline as a negative control) to assess the effects of high GI carbohydrates on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and markers of glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle (SIRT1, PGC-1α, GSK-3β, GLUT4). Results showed that high-GI carbohydrates significantly enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. Waxy rice starch (WRS), containing a high amylopectin content (98.57 %), was found to be particularly effective due to its high rapidly digestible starch (RDS) content (66.01 %) and a GI of 102 after cooked into an amorphous state. Consequently, it can be concluded that a long-term moderate intake of amorphous rice starch induces the body to increase insulin sensitivity and improve glycometabolism. These findings emphasize the functional characteristics of high-GI starchy foods, offering a more profound understanding of carbohydrate-based diets."

      "abstract": "Target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathways are major regulators of starch accumulation in various eukaryotes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this regulation remain elusive. Here, we report the role of TOR signaling in starch degradation in the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Reanalysis of our previously published phosphoproteome data showed that phosphorylation of the serine residue at position 264 of a protein similar to α-glucan water dikinase (CmGWD), a key regulator of starch degradation, was not increased by rapamycin treatment. In the CmGWD knockout strain, starch content increased and starch phosphorylation decreased, indicating that CmGWD is a functional GWD. CmGWD-dependent starch degradation under dark conditions was alleviated by rapamycin treatment. The overexpression of a phosphomimic CmGWD variant, in which Ser264 was replaced by aspartic acid, or a dephosphomimic CmGWD variant, in which Ser264 was replaced by alanine, resulted in 0.6-fold lower and 1.6-fold higher starch accumulation compared to the wild-type CmGWD-overexpressing strain, respectively. The starch levels corresponded with starch phosphorylation status. Furthermore, the dephosphomimic CmGWD-overexpressing strain accumulated nearly the same amount of starch with or without rapamycin treatment as the rapamycin-treated wild-type CmGWD-overexpressing strain. In contrast, rapamycin treatment did not trigger an increase in starch accumulation in the phosphomimic CmGWD-overexpressing strain. These results indicate that TOR signaling regulates starch degradation in C. merolae by altering the phosphorylation state of Ser264 in CmGWD.",

In this study, we developed a reactive deep eutectic solvent (DES) formed by 2, 3-epoxypropyl trimethyl ammoniumchloride (GTA) and urea, which was used as a reaction reagent and diffusion agent. DES has a strong hydrogen bond breaking effect and can penetrate into the starch granules, while mechanical force was introduced to fragment and refine the starch granules, destroying their internal structure and further promoting the penetration of DES, which was realised under the dual action of DES and mechanical force to achieve the starch-based flocculant (St-GTA) preparation. Gel permeation chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 1H NMR nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) were used to characterise the prepared St-GTA, and its flocculation performance and flocculation mechanism were investigated by zeta potential and UV-Vis absorption tests. The flocculation efficiency of St-GTA on the simulated kaolin wastewater was systematically investigated, and its flocculation effect on other colloidal contaminants and real wastewater was also studied. The results showed that the dosage of St-GTA only needed to be 0.4 mg/L to achieve a removal rate of 98.5 % for the simulated kaolin wastewater, and its removal rate for the rest of the colloidal pollutants and the real wastewater could all reach 98 %. Therefore, the starch-based flocculant can be used as a new type of flocculant for wastewater treatment and has shown excellent properties, demonstrating its potential as a sustainable alternative to traditional flocculants."

Steam explosion treatment altered the physicochemical properties of whole grain oat flour, evidenced by changes in color parameters (L* from 70.9 to 67.4, WI from 58.6 to 54.4), degree of gelatinization (increased from 21.4 % to 89.9 %), and gel network stability. Notably, steam explosion treatment uniquely disrupted starch crystallinity and reduced amylopectin content (40.8 % to 31.1 %). Microscopic analysis (scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy) and multi-scale structural characterization (infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry) revealed that the oat starch-protein mixture exhibited a three-dimensional cellular network, with significantly increased hydrogen bonding between starch and protein. This interaction formed a cross-linked gel network structure, enhancing gel strength, water retention, and thermal stability while delaying starch retrogradation, ultimately improving the shelf life of oatmeal porridge. Mechanistic analysis revealed that steam explosion treatment enhanced water molecule binding to macromolecules, mitigating water migration and structural degradation during storage. This research provides new insights into the molecular interactions underpinning whole oat processing, offering a foundation for the development of high-quality whole oat-based products."

An in vitro starch digestibility assay was employed to measure the contents of rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS), and resistant starch (RS). The intensities of the peaks attributed to covalent vibrational modes at 9.0, 10.5, and 13.1 THz showed a strong correlation with RDS content (R2 > 0.95).

LRS3 intake reduced lactic acid-producing bacteria such as Allobaculum, Collinsella, and Blautia in the colon while promoting SCFAs-producing Ruminococcaceae. SL alone stimulated Lachnospiraceae growth. When both were administered, there was a significant increase in Treponema and Ruminococcaceae. The co-intervention of LRS3 and SL significantly affected lipid metabolism-related metabolites, up-regulating palmitic acid while down-regulating androsterone and phosphatidylcholine (PC) substances PC (14:0/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), influencing unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathways and inhibiting steroid hormone biosynthesis. Finally, via the microbial-metabolism-lipid correlation network, we identified that LRS3 and SL increased SCFAs production through Treponema and Ruminococcaceae metabolism, influencing organic acid and lipid composition in the colon. This indirectly reduced blood lipid levels in hyperlipidemic rats by modulating intestinal microecology."

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic disorder affecting millions worldwide. Recent advancements suggest that combining therapies can significantly improve AD treatment outcomes and mitigate the challenges of long-term drug use, particularly with corticosteroids. In this study, we developed a 3D-printed hydrogel composed of gelatin (Gel) and dialdehyde starch (DAS), capable of encapsulating and delivering hydrocortisone (HC). DAS was synthesized via an oxidation reaction, introducing aldehyde groups that facilitated hydrogel formation with Gel through imine bond formation (Schiff base reaction). By adjusting the Gel/DAS ratio, we formulated inks with suitable rheological properties for extrusion-based 3D printing, an approach not yet fully exploited in this context. The resulting Gel/DAS network successfully encapsulated HC, as demonstrated by characterization analyses. The printed hydrogel exhibited a well-defined microstructure, significant water absorption and retention capabilities, and excellent stability. HC release followed a controlled mechanism consistent with Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetics. In an in vivo model, the 3D-printed hydrogel containing HC showed therapeutic efficacy comparable to conventional HC treatments in alleviating AD symptoms in mice. Additionally, the hydrogel significantly reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and increased non-protein thiol (NPSH) levels in the dorsal skin of DNCB-exposed mice, underscoring its therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Drought is a natural disaster that exerts considerable adverse impacts on the agricultural sector. This study aimed to investigate the cytokinin-mediated carbohydrate accumulation in the aerial parts of the plant and the roots in four-month-old drought-stressed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) plants. To achieve this, exogenous treatments containing 50 mM of the synthetic cytokinin 6-Benzylaminopurine (6-BA) were applied prior to the onset of drought stress and every seven days during the 14-day drought stress period. These plants were subjected to varying levels of soil water holding capacity (WHC): 25 ± 5% (severe stress), 50 ± 5% (moderate stress), and 100 ± 5% (control). A range of morpho-physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses were evaluated. Our data suggest that the reduction of starch and the accumulation of water-soluble carbohydrates (WSCs) induced by severe drought stress were mitigated (reduced by half) in the roots and shoots of plants treated with 6-BA under similar drought conditions. This treatment may support plants by promoting the normal storage of energy reserves, thereby enhancing their resilience during subsequent periods of water scarcity. Furthermore, the application of 6-BA facilitates the regulation of carbohydrate accumulation, proline content, and enzymatic activity. 6-BA functions by downregulating the expression of cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase genes, particularly FaCKX1 and FaCKX3, and by upregulating the FaIPT8 gene. This mechanism inhibits the degradation of cytokinins and promotes root growth under conditions of severe drought stress. 6-BA reduced FaPIN1 expression during moderate drought stress compared to the corresponding control, indicating that cytokinins can alter auxin transport mechanisms and help plants prioritize growth processes under water scarcity. The application of 6-BA not only serves as an effective sink for enhancing starch accumulation in leaves but also inhibits the expression of the chlorophyll degradation gene (FaSGR), thereby preventing chlorophyll degradation. This dual action aids plants in sustaining their growth and development during episodes of short-term drought stress.

After treatment, the contents of complexed lipids, complex index, and single helix in the complexes increased, and the values were lower for complexes containing longer-chain fatty acids. Although more single helices formed for short-chain fatty acids (10 ≤ C ≤ 12), the short-range molecular order and relative crystallinity of the complexes decreased. However, the complexes containing long-chain fatty acids (14 ≤ C ≤ 18) showed the opposite changes.

METHOD: Thickened liquids matching the four consistency levels advocated by the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) guidelines were prepared. To assess their clinical applicability, 76 post-stroke dysphagic patients were randomly divided into three groups: a xanthan gum (XG) group (n=26), an LRS group (n=26), and a control group (n=24). All groups received an intervention including swallow-related exercises and oral feeding training. The control group used regular foods (water, juice, congee, egg custard, and banana puree), while the XG and LRS groups used their respective thickened liquids. Swallowing performance was assessed before and after the intervention using the Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA), Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS), and gastric tube use duration and removal rate, incidence of adverse reactions, and cost of thickening associated with the three groups were obtained after intervention. RESULTS: While all groups experienced a significant improvement after the intervention, as indicated by the SSA and PAS scores, the XG and LRS groups demonstrated significantly better outcomes than the control group. In addition, the XG and LRS patients had shorter gastric tube use, greater removal rate, and fewer incidence of adverse reactions than the controls. The cost of XG was greater than that of LRS powder for the intervention. CONCLUSION: LRS powder can be used to prepare thickened liquids of different consistencies following the IDDSI framework. Its efficacy and safety in treating dysphagia are comparable to XG based thickeners. However, seeing its markedly lower cost, LRS powder can be considered a viable alternative to XG based commercial thickeners."

The starches underwent ultrasonication at 40°C for 3, 9, and 15 min, followed by acetylation, with native starches used as control. The morphological, physicochemical, and functional properties were comprehensively analyzed. Results revealed that increased treatment time significantly (p<0.05) affected the starches functional properties, morphology and crystallinity. Amylose content was highest in NES (22.85 %), followed by NSP (21.05 %) and NCS (19.28 %). Following dual modification, a significant reduction in amylose content was observed in ultrasonic-assisted acetylated starches. Morphological analysis revealed granular aggregation, surface changes, and the formation of pores and cracks. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns demonstrated that NSP and NES starches exhibited major peaks characteristic of C-type starches, while NCS starches displayed an A-type pattern. Following ultrasound-assisted acetylation, the crystalline structures of all starches remained largely unchanged, although relative crystallinity slightly decreased compared to native starches. The oil absorption capacity and tap density of NES increased with dual modification, suggesting enhanced hydrophobicity. These findings highlight the potential of dual modification to improve starch properties for industrial applications, including confectionery, edible films, tablet binders, and encapsulation.",

CP treatment caused the deposition of precipitates on the starch surfaces. While it did not alter the crystalline type, it reduced the relative crystallinity, particularly in potato starch (PS), with a 6.5 % decrease. Amylopectin chain length analysis showed depolymerization as the dominant effect in PS, while corn starh (CS) experienced cross-linking and degradation. Furthermore, the formation of smaller particles through CP enhanced water-holding capacity. CP treatment induced lower digestibility in both raw and cooked starches, especially uncooked PS showed slowly-digestible and resistant starch content with 11.59 % and 59.69 %.

The HB treatment improved the activity of granule-bound starch synthase and decreased starch branching enzymes, soluble starch synthase and amylase activity, leading to the formation of HAS by enhancing amylose production with simultaneously attenuating amylopectin biosynthesis. HB induction mainly changed the structure of amylose with increased chain lengths rather than amylopectin, and the ordered structures and degree of branching were also reduced. The produced HAS under HB induction (H-MS) was a kind of very small granular starch with A-type crystalline. It was identified to have a high proportion of short-chain amylopectin and elongated amylose that enabled low gelatinization temperatures (56-69 °C) and digestibility (containing 55.58 % of resistant starch).

Scanning Electron Microscope results showed that LS and LP existed in a blended form. X-ray diffraction revealed that the crystallinity decreased with an increase in treatment intensity of LS-LP blends.

      "abstract": "Corn starch and oleic acid were treated with microwave-assisted lipase catalysis under low moisture conditions. The effects of the treatments on the interaction, structural changes and binding mechanism between corn starch and oleic acid were investigated. After microwave treatment, some of the α-1,4 glycosidic bonds in corn starch were broken, causing linear starch to precipitate. The content of amylose increased from 23.40 % to 51.66 %. The structure facilitates an increase the degree of complexation. The complex index of corn starch-oleic acid complexes was 43.2 % and that of corn starch-oleic acid conjugates was 57.7 %. The structures of samples were studied using by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance carbon spectrum, and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the esterification reaction promoted the complexation reaction, creating a more stable structure that was less prone to disintegration. Among them, the starch-oleic acid conjugated compounds' resistant starch content was the highest at 69.12 %. The thermal stability of the corn starch oleic acid conjugate has also increased compared to the corn starch-oleic acid complex, with ΔH increased from 26.77 % to 31.33 %. The present study confirmed that the microwave combined with lipase catalysis could produce resistant starch with a more stable structure.",

In this study, sequential enzyme (α-amylase (AA), β-amylase (BA), transglucosidase (TG) and pullulanase (Pull)) modification method was used to modify Coix lachryma-jobi L. starch, and the effects of TG treatment time on the physicochemical properties of starch were investigated. The results indicate that the morphology of sequentially enzyme-modified starch granules was altered, showing fissures, indentations on the granule surface, hollow regions, or fragmented structures. Compared with native starch, the amylose content, solubility, expansion potential and transparency increased, the relative crystallinity of Pull-S and TG-0 h starch decreased. With the extension of TG modification time, the relative crystallinity of starch granules, slow-digestible starch (SDS) content and peak gelatinization temperature (Tp) first increased and then decreased, while resistant starch (RS) first decreased and then increased. TG 12 h, RS content (40.65 %) was the lowest and SDS content (55.93 %) was the highest.

      "abstract": "Polyphenols are closely related to human health, but thermal treatment causes the loss of polyphenol activity. Complexation between amylose and polyphenol prevents oxidation and degradation of polyphenols during thermal treatment. And the functional properties of the complex are affected by the polyphenol backbone. Therefore, this study compared the complexation between pre-formed V-amylose (V6a) and polyphenols with different backbones (C6-C1, C6-C3, and C6-C3-C6). Specifically, a non-inclusion complex was formed between V6a and PHBA through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, whereas p-coumaric acid (PCA, C6-C3 backbone) and 6-hydroxyflavone (HF, C6-C3-C6 backbone) formed V-type inclusion complexes with V6a. In addition, V6a-PCA possessed greater relative crystallinity (42.70 %), higher thermal stability (136.2 °C), higher encapsulation efficiency (22.8 %), and stronger antioxidant activity (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity = 62.80 %). Finally, the molecular dynamic simulation corroborated the effect of the polyphenol backbone on the complex type. This study suggested that C6-C3 backbone polyphenols facilitated the formation of inclusion complexes with V-amylose compared to hydrophilic C6-C1 backbone polyphenols and C6-C3-C6 backbone polyphenols. V-type inclusion complexes are effective encapsulation carriers, which can be used in the future to enhance the bioactivity of polyphenols in food processing.",

Identifying genes that improve the recovery of photosynthesis from low temperatures in maize will help enhance the cold tolerance of this crop and ensure stable yields. Here, we demonstrate the role of starch phosphorylase 2 (ZmPHOH) in promoting photosynthetic recovery from cold damage. Chlorotic leaf3 (chl3), a null mutant of ZmPHOH, which undergoes chlorophyll degradation and chlorosis earlier than under normal growth conditions after brief exposure to 8 °C and restoration to normal. We determined that chl3 plants could not repair the damage to their photosynthetic system caused by short-term cold exposure after the temperature returned to normal. Metabolome and transcriptome profiling indicated that the soluble sugar content in chl3 leaves was significantly increased after cold treatment and could not be catabolized promptly, leading to repression of photosynthetic gene expression. Our results reveal that ZmPHOH enhances post-cold photosynthetic recovery by promoting the decomposition and metabolism of soluble sugars, thereby regulating the low-temperature resilience in maize, which provides new insights into the chilling tolerance mechanism of maize.",

      "abstract": "Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for the human body and is closely linked to health. Rice (Oryza sativa L.), as a major staple food globally, is the primary source of Se intake for humans. To better achieve Se biofortification in rice, it is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms behind rice's response to different Se concentrations. This study investigates the morphological and transcriptomic responses of rice seedlings to low (1 µM, LSe) and high (10 µM, HSe) Se concentrations compared to a control (CK). Morphological analyses revealed that LSe promoted growth, enhancing shoot and root length and biomass, whereas HSe treatment inhibited these parameters, indicating Se's dual role in rice growth. Notably, the most significant promotion of rice growth was observed at the Se concentration of 1 µM. The organic Se content and antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, POD and CAT) in rice seedlings also reached their maximum values simultaneously. Total RNA was extracted for transcriptome sequencing, and differential gene expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2. Transcriptomic sequencing highlighted distinct responses under LSe and HSe conditions. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed significant involvement in processes related to oxidoreductase activity and cellular structures. KEGG pathway analysis emphasized that Se treatments notably enhanced the glutathione metabolism pathway, which is crucial for antioxidant defense. Additionally, significant changes were observed in starch and sucrose metabolism and cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met) metabolism pathways, showing upregulation under LSe treatment and downregulation under HSe. Six key genes were validated using qRT-PCR, confirming their differential expression under varied Se treatments. The Cys, Met and starch content assays as well as qRT-PCR data demonstrated that LSe promoted the synthesis and accumulation of Cys, Met and starch, supporting enhanced growth and antioxidant capacity. Conversely, HSe inhibited the synthesis and accumulation of Cys, Met and starch in rice seedlings, and these data were also consistent with the physiological phenotype. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which rice seedlings adapt to varying Se levels, with implications for Se biofortification and stress management strategies in crops.",

A total of 180 experimental fish (13.5 ± 0.5 g) were randomly divided into three treatments, and three floating cages (1 m × 1 m × 1 m) were set up for each treatment. A total of 20 fish per net were kept in an outdoor pond for 8 weeks. The results showed that both the HW and HP groups had an altered structure and a reduced diversity of gut microbiota. LAB increased the abundance of Cetobacterium and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidota and decreased PC (16:1/20:5) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid levels. LAB promoted the expression of genes related to the intestinal bile acid cycle (fxr, hmgcr, rxr, shp and hnf4α) and inhibited the expression of pparβ and g6pase (p < 0.05). LAB reduced the expression of genes related to transported cholesterol (lxr and ldlr) (p < 0.05) in the liver. In conclusion, LAB addition could regulate the gut microbiota disorders caused by high starch levels, promote cholesterol metabolism, produce bile acids, and reduce lipid deposition."

Methods: A total of 155 patients (81% male, median age: 68 years) who underwent first-time DSM-TACE between 07/13 and 06/22 were included in the study. Inflammatory indices were dichotomized using median values. Cox proportional hazard model for univariate (UVA) and multivariate (MVA) analyses (hazard ratio; 95% CI, p-value) and Kaplan-Meier analyses (overall survival (OS) in months; 95% CI; log-rank test) were performed. Results: The median OS of the study cohort was 15.9 (12.9-20) months with a median survival according to BCLC stages A (12%), B (41%), and C (47%) of median not reached, 19.3 (15.3-27), and 7.2 (4.5-9.0) months, respectively (p < 0.0001). In the UVA, several inflammatory markers on OS were statistically significant with the systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI; ≤median (2.04) HR: 0.41 (0.19-0.89); p = 0.024) and the lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR; >median (1.82) HR: 0.44 (0.2-0.9); p = 0.025) remaining statistically significant in MVA together with the BCLC stage (p = 0.0001), ALBI grade (p = 0.016), hepatic tumor burden (≤25% vs. >25%; p = 0.006), and largest HCC lesion (≤5.5 cm vs. >5.5 cm; p = 0.008). In subgroup analysis, patients with elevated LMR and reduced SIRI exhibited significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) in both BCLC B (p < 0.0001) and Child-Pugh A (p = 0.021) subgroups. Conclusion: The findings suggest that SIRI and LMR may serve as valuable tools in identifying BCLC B and Child-Pugh A patients who could potentially benefit better from DSM-TACE treatment. Nevertheless, further research is recommended to confirm these findings and to provide more comprehensive insights."

Mung beans of different varieties (Eohul, Geumsung, and Sohyeon) were cross-linked using an STMP:STPP ratio of 9:1. The structure and thermal properties of CLMB and its digestibility, as well as the textural properties of 10% CLMB gels and their freeze-thaw stability, were evaluated. As a result of the study, CLMB maintained an A-type crystalline structure, but structural changes due to the introduction of phosphate groups were observed during FT-IR analysis. Compared to natural mung bean starch (MBS), the swelling power and solubility decreased, and the gelatinization temperature range increased. Additionally, the cross-linking treatment increased the resistant starch (RS) content. In the case of the gel with 10% CLMB added, the freezing-thawing experiment results show a significant reduction in syneresis and it was confirmed that high stability was maintained even through repeated processes. Our results suggest that CLMB is a functional ingredient with potential applications in the development of food products offering extended shelf lives and tailored nutritional benefits."

Superheated steam treatment significantly reduced the amylose and protein content, and increased the average particle size of rice starch. Compared with the control, the enthalpy change (ΔH) in the superheated steam treatment rice starch decreased notably from 6.53 to 5.28 after treatment, the relative crystallinity of the starch was significantly reduced from 21.20 to 10.89, and the short-term order of the starch was enhanced owing to the rearrangement of starch molecules after gelatinization. The starch structure was more compact and orderly after the superheated steam treatment, which significantly improved the hardness, viscoelasticity, and strength of the gel. These results indicate that superheated steam treatment improves the quality of rice by changing the structure of rice starch."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The increasing global demand for starch has created an urgent need to identify more efficient and sustainable production methods. However, traditional starch sources, such as crop-based options, experience significant bottlenecks due to limitations in land use, water consumption, and the impacts of climate change. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore and develop new sources of starch. METHODS: We develop a novel duckweed cultivation technology that combines nutrients limitation and CO2 supplementation to achieve very high starch content. In this study, we integrated whole-genome sequencing, epigenomics, transcriptomics, enzyme activity, and composition variation to elucidate the mechanisms of efficient starch accumulation in duckweed in terms of starch accumulation and carbon partitioning, regulation of the expression of genes in the starch metabolic pathway, and sucrose biosynthesis and transportation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Although Landoltia punctata exhibits dramatic gene family contraction, its starch content and productivity reached 72.2% (dry basis) and 10.4 g m-2 d-1, respectively, in 10 days, equivalent to a yield of 38.0 t ha-1 y-1, under nutrient limitation treatment with elevated CO2 levels. We also examined the mechanism of high starch accumulation in duckweed. This phenomenon is associated with the regulation of DNA methylation and transcription factors as well as the significantly upregulated transcription levels and the increased activities of key enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis. Moreover, while nitrogen redistribution was increased, sucrose biosynthesis and transportation and lignocellulose biosynthesis were reduced. These alterations led to a reduction in lignocellulose and protein contents and ultimately an increase in the accumulation of starch in the chloroplasts. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates the potential of duckweed as a highly efficient starch producer."

However, there is no research on the molecular mechanism of TPD recovery. RESULTS: In this study, the TPD trees were recovered by treatment with TPD rehabilitation nutrient agents that could promote the recovery of latex flow on the tapping panel of TPD trees. The genes and proteins involved in TPD recovery were first identified by employing integrated transcriptomics and proteomics analyses. In total, 2029 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 951 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were detected in the bark of recovery trees compared to that of TPD trees. Among them, 19 DEPs and 11 DEGs were found to be involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway, suggesting their important roles in regulating the syntheses of sucrose and D-glucose, which were the key precursors of natural rubber biosynthesis. Furthermore, 16 DEPs and 15 DEGs were identified in the rubber biosynthesis pathway. Interestingly, almost all the DEPs and DEGs related to rubber biosynthesis exhibited significantly up-regulated expressions in the recovery trees, indicating that latex biosynthesis were probably markedly enhanced during TPD recovery. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TPD recovery, as well as excellent supplements to the mechanisms of TPD occurrence, which will contribute to the development of more effective agents for the prevention and treatment of TPD in the future.",

      "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a ubiquitous foodborne pathogenic bacterium, is prevalent in a wide array of food products and frequently implicated in food poisoning incidents, necessitating effective means for its real-time monitoring and rapid detection. In response to this need, this study introduces an innovative dual-mode point-of-care testing (POCT) approach for detecting live S. aureus, leveraging the catalase (CAT)-induced H2O2-mediated reaction. This method integrates a starch-KI paper test with solution colorimetry, offering a dual-modal detection system. The use of commercial starch-KI test strips stands out for its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, rapidness, and enhanced stability and repeatability in large-scale applications, as it requires no modifications or treatments. Furthermore, combining with the solution colorimetry, the dual signal outputs enable mutual correction, significantly boosting detection accuracy and minimizing both false positives and negatives. The starch-KI test strips provide swift visual results, allowing for immediate identification, while the enzyme cascade-based solution colorimetry offers quantitative analysis with impressive lower limits of detection (72 CFU mL-1 for solution colorimetry). These low detection thresholds demonstrate the system's high sensitivity and precision. This dual-modal platform enables real-time monitoring and early intervention in food systems, preventing food poisoning. Its practicality, low cost, and user-friendliness make it an appealing diagnostic tool for both industrial food processors and public health authorities, particularly in regions with limited resources. By addressing the critical need for accurate, rapid, and cost-effective S. aureus detection, this dual-modal platform could significantly contribute to enhancing food safety globally.",

This study investigated dry heating treatment (DHT) as an ecofriendly and cost-effective approach to modifying potato starch for biomembrane fabrication. DHT-treated starch (2 h) produced biomembranes with a denser structure, smoother surfaces, and significantly improved mechanical properties, including higher tensile strength (∼6×), rigidity (∼15×), and relative crystallinity (∼2×) while reducing flexibility (∼5×), compared to native starch membranes. These membranes also exhibited lower moisture content, reduced hydrophilicity, higher surface energy, decreased biodegradability, and enhanced bioactivity, as shown by hydroxyapatite formation in simulated body fluid. Importantly, they were nontoxic to osteoblasts, emphasizing their potential for medical applications.

This study investigated the effects of five oleic acid-based lipids (oleic acid, monoolein, diolein, triolein, and rapeseed oil) and thermomechanical treatment on the structural and physicochemical properties of wheat starch. The crystal patterns and complexing indices showed that thermomechanical treatment promoted the formation of oleic acid, monoolein, and diolein V-type starch-lipid complexes with an intact granular structure, whereas triolein and rapeseed oil formed complexes with starch. Moreover, oleic acid, monoolein, and diolein significantly altered starch gelatinisation, retrogradation behaviour, more resistant starch formed in their complexes and thus decreased its digestibility. Rheological analyses indicated that the formation of lipid complexes increased the viscoelastic modulus of starch. Our results deepen understanding of the key role of oleic acid-rich lipids in starch-based foods.",

EFTFS and ENS exhibit new characteristic peaks absorption peaks near 1760 cm-1. Microscopic analysis further revealed that the unique granular structure and morphology of EFTFS underwent gelatinization and aggregation, which reduced swelling capacity. In this regard, the RS produced by lactic acid showed the least swelling capacity, followed by malic and citric acid due to the merged and coarse structure. Paste viscosities were significantly lower in all modified starches than native starch, with the lowest viscosities observed for EFTFS treated with lactic acid. The resistant starch created from FTF depicted slowly digestible malic and citric acid content due to the creation of significant cross-linkage compared to lactate and native starch.

Ethanol-induced V-type granular starch (EVGS), a type of cold-water swelling starch, can be prepared through ethanol-aqueous heat treatment (EAHT). Four types of native starch with three crystalline structures were used to prepare EVGS. At 70 % ethanol, the preparation process was divided into temperature gradients to explore the EVGS formation process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) and non-isothermal kinetics analysis revealed three stages in the formation process: destruction of the native crystalline structure, formation of composite crystalline structure, and complete formation of V-type crystalline structure. The observed \"blocklets\" structure of EVGS suggested that the crystalline structure transformation might be based on this structural unit. A water phase gradient dispersion method was used to monitor the cold-water swelling behavior of EVGS: as the dispersion time increased, short-chain amylose leached first, followed by long-chain amylose, accompanied by the enhanced hydrophilicity of amylopectin, the \"blocklets\" structure limited EVGS swelling extent and prevented complete granules rupture, contributing to its cold paste stability. Overall, this study further elucidated the formation process and the multi-scale structure of EVGS and proposed an interpretation of cold-water swelling process for EVGS."

The dietary treatments were the control (basal diet) and RPL-T groups of basal diet + 191.1 mg/kg body weight (BW), basal diet + 95.6 mg/kg BW, and basal diet + 19.1 mg/kg BW groups. Blood samples were collected to measure blood hormones on day 0, 1, 3, and 5 of the experiment to study serum MEL and GI tract and duodenal starch degradability. The design was 4 × 4 Latin square and the data were analyzed using the ANOVA procedure by SPSS. The D-glucose content in the RPL-T treatment groups was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. The serum cholecystokinin (CCK) levels were increased in the RPL-T treatment group compared to the control group. However, there was no significant difference between all RPL-T treatment groups. The results of serum MEL were also similar to CCK results. The serum secretin levels were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between all groups. The apparent starch disappearance rates in GI track were lower (p < 0.05) in treatment groups compared with the control, and there was no significant difference between all RPL-T treatment groups. Digestion was increased (p < 0.05) in all treatment groups compared to the control. Overall, there were significant differences in starch digestibility, CCK, and MEL compared to the control group, but there were no significant differences in concentration of RPL-T.

Controlled hydrothermal treatment technology had been constructed to achieve stable interactions between starch and thiamine (VB1) molecules, resulting in the preparation of starch-thiamine complexes. The formation mechanism, intermolecular interactions, and structural properties between starch and thiamine were investigated and their digestive and physicochemical properties were explored. FTIR, XRD, ROMAN, and NMR results showed thiamine could interact with starch molecules primarily in two ways. One way was that thiamine could be binded to the exterior of the starch helical cavity via hydrogen bond. The other way is that thiamine could enter the starch helical cavity to form V-type crystals through electrostatic adsorption action, where both interaction ways would exhibit thermal competitive effects. After in vitro gastrointestinal digestion simulation, it was found that following the interaction with thiamine, the content of slowly digestible starch and resistant starch in the starch had both increased. Thiamine could slowly release in the colon, successfully achieving its stable and sustained release, thereby extending its retention time in the human body. Overall, starch-thiamine complexes displayed digestion resistance, encapsulate and protect thiamine, and promote controlled release of thiamine, thereby prolonging its retention in vivo for the fermentation.",

The findings indicated that each physical treatment enhanced the complex index between starch and resveratrol. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the inherent A-type crystallinity of the starch remained unchanged after modifications. Heat-moisture treatment induced the most profound alterations in the long-range and short-range order. While DBD plasma and ultrasound did not affect the granular morphology, heat-moisture treatment caused the most significant disruption. Furthermore, DBD plasma and ultrasound treatments significantly enhanced the solubility, gelatinization temperature, and viscoelastic properties of banana starch, while having a negligible effect on its digestibility. After heat-moisture treatment, banana starch exhibited significantly higher gelatinization temperatures (To = 72.13 °C, Tp = 82.56 °C, Tc = 83.69 °C) and a digestion rate of 82.37 %, compared to those observed with DBD plasma and ultrasound treatments, despite reduced solubility and viscoelasticity. Additionally, all three treatments improved the oil absorption capacity of the starch. The integration of resveratrol not only consolidated starch structure but also augmented its thermal stability and resistant starch content. These findings provide empirical support for modifying banana starch and expanding its application in food industry.",
