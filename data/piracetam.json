      "abstract": "Valproic acid (VPA) is a very effective therapy used to treat generalized epilepsy, but it must be avoided during pregnancy as it leads to a high risk of teratogenesis. Its teratogenic effect is believed to be due to its placental toxic effect, altering angiogenesis and inducing oxidative stress. Piracetam (PIRA) is a derivative of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and has anti-oxidative and pro-angiogenic features. However, its effects against Valproic acid-evoked placental toxicity and abnormal fetal development have not been mechanistically examined. Herein, the present study targets angiogenesis and oxidative stress by Piracetam to investigate the potential modulation of Valproic acid-induced placental toxicity and abnormal fetal development in rats. After administration of Valproic acid (500 mg/kg/day, orally) and/or piracetam (500 mg/kg/day, orally) from the 6th to 15th of gestation, fetuses and placenta were obtained for analysis. The present findings revealed that Piracetam improved the histopathological lesions in the placenta and restored the labyrinth zone area percent. Moreover, it improved the intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) via restoring fetal body weight and length and also ameliorated all external malformations (subcutaneous hemorrhage, fore limb, and hind limb anomalies) and additionally amended the skeletal lack of ossification. These favorable effects of Piracetam were mediated by the enhancement of placental angiogenesis via the VEGF/eNOS/TGF-β pathway and attenuating placental oxidative stress, which appeared as decreased MDA content and increased GSH and TAC levels. In conclusion, activation of placental angiogenesis via the VEGF/eNOS/TGF-β axis alongside inhibition of oxidative stress by Piracetam can ameliorate Valproic acid-evoked placental toxicity and, subsequently, fetal malformations in rats.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge due to cognitive decline resulting from nerve cell degeneration. Shatavarin IV, a prominent bioactive compound fromAsparagus racemosus and Piracetam, has been investigated for its neuroprotective potential. This study examines the molecular docking, formulation, and characterization of a nanoemulsion containing Piracetam and Shatavarin IV for treating AD. The in silico study demonstrated that Shatavarin IV exhibited strong binding affinities with multiple AD-related targets, including TNF-α (-7.29 kcal/mol), the GSK-3 axin complex (-9.6785 kcal/mol), amyloid-β (-6.8326 kcal/mol), and GSK-3 β (-8.8243 kcal/mol). The extraction of Shatavarin IV from Asparagus racemosus roots yielded 401.1 ± 2.3 mg with a purity of 66%, as confirmed by HPTLC. A combination index study revealed a synergistic effect with a CI value of 0.10843 at a 1:1 ratio of Piracetam and Shatavarin IV. The nanoemulsion was optimized using a Box-Behnken design, with oil concentration, surfactant mixture (S mix), and sonication time as key factors. The optimized formulation exhibited a particle size of 183.6 nm and a PDI of 0.194. Characterization techniques, including TEM and DSC, confirmed the uniformity, stability, and incorporation of the drugs in the nanoemulsion. The in vitro drug release study revealed a significantly higher release profile (84.30 ± 1.03% in 24 h) for the nanoemulsion than the drug suspension. Ex vivo studies demonstrated a superior permeability rate for the nanoemulsion (56.35 ± 1.19%) compared to the conventional suspension. Additionally, the nanoemulsion showed enhanced antioxidant activity compared with the pure extract. Stability studies indicated that the formulation remained stable with only minor changes in particle size, PDI, and zeta potential over time. This nanoemulsion presents a promising therapeutic strategy for AD."

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that inherited astrocyte dysfunction can be a primary trigger for epilepsy development; however, the available data are rather limited. In addition, astrocytes are considered as a perspective target for the design of novel and improvement of the existing antiepileptic therapy. Piracetam and related nootropic drugs are widely used in the therapy of various epileptic disorders, but detailed mechanisms of racetams action and, in particular, their effects on glial functions are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the functional state of astrocytes in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) rats genetically prone to audiogenic seizures and compared the action of piracetam on the DG astrocytes in KM and normal Wistar rats. Wistar and naïve KM rats which received injections of saline (control) or piracetam (100 mg/kg) for 21 days were recruited in our studies. Comparative analysis of control Wistar and KM rats revealed genetically determined abnormalities in DG astrocytes of KM rats including an increased expression of NFIA but a decreased GFAP, ALDH1L1, EAATs, and glutamine synthetase (GS). Piracetam treatment normalized the expression of all studied markers, except NFIA, in KM rats, while in Wistar rats, it potentiated only GS and NFIA. The results suggested that the nootropic and antiepileptic effects of piracetam may be, at least partially, mediated by the modulation of astroglia functions. In addition, analysis of NFIA and GS colocalization revealed the novel pattern of astrocyte heterogeneity in the DG which was significantly altered in epileptic rats but corrected by piracetam.",

      "abstract": "A number of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted comparing the efficacy of piracetam with placebo and other medications in children with breath-holding spells (BHS). However, no systematic review has yet collated all this evidence. All RCTs comparing the efficacy and/or safety of piracetam with placebo or other medications in children with BHS were included. The pooled estimates were compared for the number of participants with a favorable response, the change in monthly frequency of BHS, compliance, and adverse effects in both groups. The ROB 2.0 tool was used to assess the risk of bias, and the GRADE system was used to determine the certainty of the collated evidence. We included 5 RCTs (437 participants) in the review. Piracetam group had significantly more participants with favorable responses at 1, 2 and 3 months after randomization, as compared to placebo group (RR: 6.5 (95% CI-1.8-23.2), I2 = 75%, p = 0.004, RR: 4.7 (95% CI-3.3-6.7), I2 = 49%, p < 0.0001, RR: 5.4 (95% CI-3.4-8.5), I2 = 0%, p < 0.0001 respectively). Number of participants with complete response or total cessation of attacks was more in the piracetam group compared to placebo (RR: 5.7 (95% CI-1.4-23.2), I2 = 88%, p = 0.01). Change in the average number of BHS was significantly more in the piracetam group, as compared to the placebo group (mean difference-4.9 (95% CI-0.7-9.0), I2 = 99%, p = 0.02). Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse effects were comparable in both piracetam and placebo groups (RR: 1.9 (95% CI-0.5-7.6), I2 = 0%, p = 0.33). Conclusion: Oral piracetam is efficacious and safe in children with BHS, and its efficacy may further increase by co-administration of oral docosahexaenoic acid. What is known? • Breath-holding spells (BHS) are a common pediatric condition, affecting 0.1% to 4.6% of otherwise healthy children. • Several studies have investigated the efficacy of piracetam in reducing the frequency and severity of BHS, with mixed results. What is new? • Oral piracetam is efficacious and safe in children with BHS. • Its efficacy is further increased by co-administration of oral docosahexaenoic acid.",

Evidence indicates that piracetam and compound porcine cerebroside and ganglioside injection (CPCGI) can improve cognitive levels in TBI patients to enhance functional prognosis, but there is still a research gap regarding the efficacy of CPCGI. This study aims to determine the effectiveness and safety of CPCGI in improving cognitive and functional outcomes in TBI patients. METHODS: This study is a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trial aiming to recruit 900 adult patients with mild to moderate TBI. After providing informed consent, 600 patients will be randomly assigned to the CPCGI group (20 ml/d, for 14 days), and 300 patients will be randomized to the piracetam group as a control (20 ml/d, for 14 days), followed up for 3 months after treatment. The primary outcome is the change in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score from baseline after 3 months. The main secondary outcome measures include Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), and the Barthel Index at 1 and 3 months. DISCUSSION: This multi-center clinical trial aims to provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy and safety of CPCGI in improving cognitive and functional outcomes in mild to moderate TBI patients.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore mechanism of piracetam for the treatment of spinal cord injury in rats through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. METHODS: Fifty-four healthy 6-week-old SD female rats with body weight of 80 to 100 g were divided into sham operation group, spinal cord injury group and piracetam group by random number table method, with 18 rats in each group. Spinal cord injury model was established in spinal cord injury group and piracetam group using percussion apparatus, while sham operation group did not damage spinal cord. Piracetam group was injected with piracetam injection through tail vein according to 5 ml·kg-1 standard, once a day for 3 days;the other two groups were injected with normal saline at the same dose, the same frequency and the same duration. The rats were sacrificed at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery, and changes of Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale was observed and compared. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect spinal cord inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-1β (interleukin-1β), necrosis factor-α (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α);HE staining was used to observe morphological changes of rats with spinal cord injury, and immunohistochemistry was used to observe expression level of aquaporin 4 (AQP4). The activation of MAPK signaling pathway in spinal cord of rats after spinal cord injury was observed by western blotting (WB). RESULTS: BBB scores of sham operation group on 1, 3 and 7 day were 21 points. In spinal cord injury group, the scores were (1±1), (4±1) and (7±2);piracetam group was (1±1), (5±1), (9±2), respectively;the difference between spinal cord injury group and sham operation group was statistically significant (P<0.05). HE staining showed that no abnormality was found in sham operation group. In spinal cord injury group, bleeding and degeneration of spinal cord tissue appeared at 1 day after operation; flaky necrotic areas were appeared in spinal cord at 3 days after surgery, and spinal cord tissue began to slowly repair at 7 days after surgery. In piracetam group, the bleeding area was less than that of spinal cord injury group at 1 day after surgery;at 3 days after operation, the necrotic area was reduced and the range of nuclear disappearance was reduced; and the spinal cord began to recover slowly at 7 days after surgery. AQP4 staining of spinal cord of rats in sham operation group was weak at 1, 3 and 7 days after modeling, AQP4 staining was deepened and area increased in spinal cord injury group, AQP4 staining of piracetam group was lighter than that of spinal cord injury group, and the positive cells were slightly increased and the staining was slightly darker than that of sham operation group. At 1, 3 and 7 days, the level of IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β and TNF-α in spinal cord injury group were higher than those in sham operation group and piracetam group(P<0.05). Compared with spinal cord injury group, the area of spinal cord bleeding and necrosis were decreased by HE staining in piracetam group, and AQP4 staining was decreased by immunohistochemistry. WB results showed that P-ERK, P-JNK and P-P38 levels in spinal cord injury group at 3 days were higher than those in sham operation group and piracetam group(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Piracetam not only showed significant effect in promoting motor function recovery after spinal cord injury, but also showed positive therapeutic potential in reducing lesion area, regulating AQP4 expression to reduce edema, and reducing inflammatory response by regulating MAPK signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Cisplatin (CDDP) is commonly employed as an antineoplastic agent, but its use is significantly limited by the occurrence of dose-dependent nephrotoxicity, the detailed mechanisms of which remain unclear. This research is aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of Piracetam (PIR)'s protective effects on nephrotoxicity resulting from CDDP exposure and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for these effects. MAIN METHODS: PIR was given in dosages of 100 and 300 mg/kg body weight for a duration of 15 days; concurrently, on the last day, a single 10 mg/kg dose of CDDP was delivered via intraperitoneal injection. Forty-eight hours post-CDDP injection, the animals were sacrificed to assess nephrotoxicity. Blood samples and renal tissues were taken for biochemical and histopathological investigations. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), caspase-9 and nuclear factor kappa b p65 (NF-κB p65) were assessed by immunohistochemistry method. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis was employed to determine cytochrome c (Cyt. c), Bcl-2-associated X-protein (BAX), caspase-3, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels in renal tissue homogenates. The mRNA levels of tumor protein P53 (TP53), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) were tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally, histopathological evaluations of the renal tissues and the binding affinity of PIR to AMPK by molecular docking were also performed. KEY FINDINGS: Pre-treatment with PIR enhanced renal function markers such as urea and creatinine, mitigated histological damage, and diminished inflammatory cell presence in renal tubules. PIR demonstrated antioxidant effects by reestablishing the equilibrium between pro-oxidants and antioxidants such as MPO, HO-1, Nrf2, as well as SOD. Furthermore, PIR inhibited the inflammatory pathways through the MAPK/NF-κB pathway. Additionally, PIR counteracted the CDDP-induced decline in PI3K/Akt activity and hindered caspase-dependent apoptotic processes. SIGNIFICANCE: In summary, PIR appears to be an effective therapeutic strategy for reducing CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity, attributed to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic mechanisms. Consequently, PIR may serve as a complementary treatment alongside CDDP to alleviate nephrotoxicity associated with CDDP.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Piracetam, a widely recognized nootropic drug, is hypothesized to enhance memory function through its influence on synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter levels. However, despite its popularity, there remains a lack of conclusive evidence regarding its impact on memory. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the effects of piracetam on memory in individuals with impaired cognitive function, comparing it to a placebo control group. OBJECTIVES: This study will evaluate how piracetam affects memory function, compared to placebo in adults with impairment in this area. METHODS: We carried out bibliographical research and meta-analysis of scientific clinical trials comparing memory function in people taking piracetam with those in the placebo group. The PubMed, Dimensions, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were used. Statistical analysis was performed in R Studio version 4.3.1. RESULTS: In our analysis, 199 articles were identified, of which we included eighteen studies, comprising a total of 886 patients, of which Piracetam was the treatment option in 442 (49.88 %) patients. Memory enhancement (SMD 0.75; 95 % CI [-0.19; 1.69]; p=0.12; I²=96 %) had no clinical difference between the intervention and the control group. CONCLUSION: Upon the conclusion of this study, it is apparent that we cannot definitively ascertain the impact of piracetam on memory function. Further research is warranted to provide a clearer understanding of the cognitive effects of piracetam in individuals with memory impairment. This investigation serves as a significant contribution to the ongoing quest to elucidate the potential benefits of piracetam in the field of cognitive neuroscience.",

In addition, Piracetam inhibited the oxidative stress of OGD-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Further, Piracetam improved mitochondrial function of OGD-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Mechanistically, Piracetam inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in OGD-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Collectively, Piracetam improved oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction of OGD-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells through PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis. Hence, Piracetam has the potential to serve as a promising drug of VaD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breath-holding spells are a benign condition primarily seen in 3% to 5% of healthy children aged between six months and five years. Although no specific treatment is recommended due to its benign nature, iron and piracetam are used in severe or recurrent cases. We planned to compare the heart rate variability (HRV) before and after treatment with 24-hour Holter monitoring in patients receiving iron and piracetam treatment and investigate the treatment's effectiveness. METHODS: Twenty-five patients who applied to the outpatient clinic between 2013 and 2015 due to breath-holding spells were included in the study. The patients who received piracetam and iron therapy and underwent 24-hour rhythm Holter monitoring were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Fourteen (56%) of these patients were evaluated as having cyanotic-type and 11 (44%) patients were assessed as having pale-type breath-holding spells. A significant difference was found only between hourly peak heart rate and total power in the group receiving iron treatment. Significant differences were also found among the minimum heart rate, mean heart rate, the standard deviation of RR intervals, the mean square root of the sum of the squares of their difference between adjacent RR intervals, spectpow, and low frequency before and after the treatment in the patients who started piracetam treatment (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study is critical as it is the first to investigate the effects of treatment options on various HRV in patients with breath-holding spells. There were statistically significant changes in HRV parameters in patients receiving piracetam, and the number of attacks decreased significantly. Piracetam treatment contributes positively to the breath-holding spell with regard to efficacy and HRV, therefore it can be used to treat breath-holding spells.",

It also investigates the potential neuroprotective effects of Piracetam, which is a nootropic drug recognized for improving cognitive ability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study incorporates four groups of mice receiving varied medication regimens, with memory tested using the Novel Location Recognition (NLR) method. RESULTS: The findings from our study revealed that memory decline and a suppression of cellular proliferation were observed in adult male mice subjected to Cisplatin treatment; furthermore, a decline in antioxidant efficacy within the hippocampal dentate gyrus was evident. Moreover, analysis of treatment effects on the animals' weight revealed that the Cisplatin and Piracetam group exhibited the most significant weight loss during drug administration. Despite the significant weight loss, the simultaneous use of Cisplatin and Piracetam demonstrated a notable improvement in memory and an augmentation of hippocampal proliferation and antioxidant effect. LIMITATIONS: It is important to note that our study was hampered by budget limits, a lack of additional animals, and mice's low tolerance for protracted treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Should the outcomes of Piracetam observed in this investigation be applicable to patients, it might offer a relatively straightforward approach to mitigate the cognitive impacts endured by cancer survivors following exposure to chemotherapy. Future research will be needed to study Piracetam's effect on mice with brain cancer after Cisplatin treatment in order to extrapolate the results onto cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: of the study: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication in which brain ammonia (NH4+) levels reach critically high concentrations because of liver failure. HE could lead to a range of neurological complications from locomotor and behavioral disturbances to coma. Several tactics have been established for subsiding blood and brain NH4+. However, there is no precise intervention to mitigate the direct neurological complications of NH4+. PURPOSE: It has been found that oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and neuro-inflammation play a fundamental role in NH4+ neurotoxicity. Piracetam is a drug used clinically in neurological complications such as stroke and head trauma. Piracetam could significantly diminish oxidative stress and improve brain mitochondrial function. RESEARCH METHODS: In the current study, piracetam (100 and 500 mg/kg, oral) was used in a mice model of HE induced by thioacetamide (TA, 800 mg/kg, single dose, i.p). RESULTS: Significant disturbances in animals' locomotor activity, along with increased oxidative stress biomarkers, including reactive oxygen species formation, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, depleted tissue glutathione, and decreased antioxidant capacity, were evident in the brain of TA-treated mice. Meanwhile, mitochondrial permeabilization, mitochondrial depolarization, suppression of dehydrogenases activity, and decreased ATP levels were found in the brain of the TA group. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines was also significantly high in the brain of HE animals. CONCLUSION: It was found that piracetam significantly enhanced mice's locomotor activity, blunted oxidative stress biomarkers, decreased inflammatory cytokines, and improved mitochondrial indices in hyperammonemic mice. These data suggest piracetam as a neuroprotective agent which could be repurposed for the management of HE."

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus piracetam with piracetam alone in reducing the frequency and severity of BHS in infants and preschool children. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial included two groups diagnosed with BHS. Group I included 50 patients who received DHA plus piracetam. Group II (control group) included 50 children who were managed with piracetam plus a placebo. Children were re-evaluated at one, three, and six months after treatment. Occurrences of BHS and drug side effects were recorded. The primary outcome was to evaluate the effect of the combined treatment of piracetam and DHA on the frequency and severity of spells. RESULTS: BHS were reported in only 16% of children six months after treatment with piracetam and DHA compared with 50% of those treated with piracetam only (P value = 0.001).

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy, a neurodegenerative disorder, continues to throw challenges in the therapeutic management. The current study sought to ascertain if the therapeutic interactions between piracetam and diethylstilbestrol may prevent grand-mal seizures in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Piracetam (PIR; 10 and 20 mg/kg) and diethylstilbestrol (DES; 10 and 20 mg/kg) alone as a low-dose combination were administered to rats for 14 days. The electroshock (MES; 180 mA, 220 V for 0.20 s) was delivered via auricular electrodes on the last day of treatment and rats were monitored for convulsive behavior. To elucidate the mechanism, hippocampal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrotic factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were quantified. Hippocampal histopathology was conducted to study the neuroprotective effect of drug/s. In vitro studies and in silico studies were conducted in parallel. RESULTS: To our surprise, the low dose of the combination regimen of PIR (10 mg/kg) and DES (10 mg/kg) unfolded synergistic anti-seizure potential, with brimming neuroprotective properties. The mechanism could be related to a significant reduction in the levels of hippocampal mTOR and proinflammatory cytokines. The docking scores revealed higher affinities for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in co-bound complex, and when docking DES first, while better affinities for protein kinase B (Akt) were revealed when docking PIR first (both drugs bind cooperatively as well). This indicated that the entire PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is intercepted by the said combination. In addition, the % of cell viability of HEK-293 cells [pre-exposed to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)] was increased by 327.29% compared to PTZ-treated cells (toxic control; 85.16%). CONCLUSIONS: We are the first to report the promising efficacy of the combination (PIR 10 mg/kg + DES 10 mg/kg) to restrain seizures and epileptogenic changes induced by electroshock by a novel mechanism involving inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.",

Many studies have reported on ETP-induced peripheral neuropathy; however, few reports have focused on its brain toxicity. The current research investigates the protective potential of taurine, piracetam and vinpocetine on serum biomarkers associated with inflammation and brain injury induced by ETP in a rodent model. A total of 30 female albino rats were equally divided into five groups; the 1st and 2nd groups were the control and ETP-treated groups, respectively, while the 3rd, 4th and 5th groups were ETP-treated rats cotreated with taurine, piracetam and vinpocetine, respectively. Administration of ETP reduced body weight significantly, enhanced production of serum proinflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6 and decreased glutathione serum levels. Moreover, ETP treatment resulted in upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression and histopathological alterations in the rats' brain compared to the control group. Co-treatment with taurine, piracetam and vinpocetine counteracted ETP-induced brain injury and altered serum biomarkers levels. We concluded that co-treatment with vinpocetine could serve as a complementary therapeutic agent in reducing brain injury and toxicity induced by ETP."

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was used in this study conducted at Baoding First Central Hospital, China from January 2017 to December 2019. Sixty patients with intraventricular hemorrhage were randomly divided into two groups. Patients in the control group were treated with external ventricular drain, while patients in the experimental group were given intraventricular urokinase injection and intravenous piracetam on the basis of the control group. The incidence of adverse drug reactions, hospitalization time, hematoma elimination time, and drainage tube removal time in two groups were compared and analyzed including the cerebrospinal fluid protein content, changes in GCS score, neurological function recovery (ADL score), and Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) of the two groups after treatment. RESULTS: The hematoma elimination time, drainage tube removal time and hospitalization time of the experimental group were shorter than those of the control group, with a statistically significant difference (P<0.05). After treatment, compared with the control group, the protein content of cerebrospinal fluid in the experimental group decreased more significantly (P=0.00), the GCS score was higher (P=0.00), the overall good rate of neurological function was higher (P=0.04), while the rate of good prognosis was higher (P=0.03). Within one month of treatment, the incidence of surgical complications in experimental group was significantly lower than that in control group (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: External ventricular drain combined with intraventricular urokinase injection and intravenous piracetam is an effective method for the treatment of intraventricular hemorrhage, which is worthy of clinical promotion."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Cyclophosphamide (Cyclo) is an immunosuppressive and antineoplastic agent. The clinical use of Cyclo is limited by significant hepatotoxicity. Piracetam (Pira) is used to improve cognitive function. Pira possesses diverse physiological functions; however, the exact mechanisms of its activity are still non-elucidated. MAIN METHODS: Forty rats were allocated in four groups. 1st group comprised normal rats; the remaining groups received single Cyclo dose (200 mg/kg/i.p.) on the experiment's 15th day. 2nd group comprised Cyclo-control rats. 3rd & 4th groups received Pira (100 & 300 mg/kg body weight) for 15 days. KEY FINDINGS: Cyclo administration resulted in deterioration of serum liver function tests and elevation of hepatic tissue concentration of P53, Nf-kβ, apoptosis-inducing factor-1, NLRP3 inflammasome, Bax; gene expression of receptor-induced protein-1 along with reduction of hepatic Bcl-2 concentration. Bax/Bcl-2 ratio headed for apoptosis. Cyclo administration also resulted in a severe deterioration of the hepatic histopathological picture and significant immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in hepatic tissues versus the normal group. Pira significantly improved all the aforementioned parameters, reallocating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio to anti-apoptosis. Moreover, Pira treatment amended Cyclo-induced histopathological abnormalities and significantly reduced caspase-3, TNF-α plus COX-2 immunoreactivity in hepatic tissues. SIGNIFICANCE: The present work is the first to link Cyclo-induced hepatotoxicity to the activation of caspase-independent apoptosis (necroptosis), pyroptosis and caspase-dependent apoptosis signaling pathways. Pira treatment significantly ameliorated Cyclo-induced hepatotoxicity mainly via the amendment of necroptotic, pyroptotic and caspase-dependent apoptotic changes along with the histopathological deformities in rats' hepatic tissues.",

Citicoline and Piracetam have been used as nootropic agents in a number of studies. In this investigation, we aimed to determine the effects of these agents solely and in combination in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in rabbit neonates. MATERIALS & METHODS: Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage was induced by the occlusion of both uterine arteries of dams for eight minutes. The subjects were randomly divided into five groups as follows (n=6 per group): control group without hypoxia (C1), control group with hypoxic-ischemic damage (C2), the third group (P) received Piracetam (100 mg/kg), the fourth group (T) administered with Citicoline (250 mg/kg), and the fifth (PT) received both. The preventive effects of the two drugs on hypoxic-ischemic brain damage were microscopically investigated by the rates of damage to the hippocampus. RESULTS: Neuronal destruction rates in C1, C2, P, T, and PT were 4%, 45%, 37.5%, 12.5% (P=0.01 vs. C2), and 20% (P=0.03 vs. C2), respectively. The total means of hypoxic-ischemic damage, cell edema, neuronal degeneration, and eosinophilic degeneration were lower in the T group compared to C2 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: According to our results and previous findings, Citicoline as a treatment for hypoxic-ischemic brain injuries could be beneficial, and it has priority over neuroprotective agents like Piracetam. Moreover, the combination of Citicoline and Piracetam showed no superior effect in contrast with Citicoline alone. However, experimental studies on larger populations and clinical trials are highly suggested."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial in 71 children from 6 months to 6 years of age with BHS. They were randomly assigned to the two study groups (Levetiracetam and Piracetam group). The frequency and severity of BHS and the response to treatment were recorded on monthly visits during our 3 months follow-up. RESULTS: There was a significant decline in the average number of frequency of spells before and after 3 months of treatment in each group in this study. Levetiracetam had significant effects on the average incidence of the loss of consciousness and seizure-like movements in our study, while Piracetam had no significant effect on the loss of consciousness. Our result showed better response in the Levetiracetam group (88.9% partial or complete response after treatment) compared with the Piracetam group (77.1% partial or complete response after treatment); however, it was not significant. It seems that Levetiracetam had better effect than Piracetam in some aspects in the treatment of BHS. CONCLUSIONS: Both Piracetam and Levetiracetam are safe and had significant effects on the frequency of BHS in our study, however, levetiracetam showed superior effects on the severity of BHS."

The data obtained made it possible to quantify the value of the synergism score for the combination «vinpocetine + piracetam» (54 points) compared with the combination «piracetam + cinnarizine» (25 points). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of «vinpocetine + piracetam» in the fixed combination (Vinpotropil) is thus more preferable for combined use than for the combination of «piracetam + cinnarizine».",

The novel therapeutic agent piracetam is a cyclic derivative of γ-aminobutyric acid and one of the oldest recognized synthetic nootropics. Piracetam improves cognitive function without stimulation or sedation. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant with nootropic activity. Caffeine promotes the performance of tasks that involve working memory to a limited extent, and it also retards cognitive decline in healthy individuals. The present study aimed to determine the protective effect of co-administering piracetam and caffeine on scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats. Pre-treatment with caffeine and piracetam decreased scopolamine-induced cognitive damage and amnesia. The preventive response was demonstrated by an improved learning tendency. The mechanism responsible for these effects requires further investigation. The co-administration of caffeine and piracetam has potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for combating amnesia."

The study group was treated with piracetam on the basis of this observation, and we test the ADL (life ability score), MoCA(montreal cognitive assessment scale), ADAS-Cog(alzheimer's scale-cognition), MMSE(mental status examination) scores and quality of life scores before and after treatment in the two groups. Before treatment, there were no significant differences in ADL, MoCA, and ADAS-Cog scores between the two groups (P>0.05). After treatment, the ADL, MoCA, and ADAS-Cog scores of the study group were superior to the control group. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in MMSE scores between the two groups before treatment and 1 month after treatment (P>0.05). The MMSE scores of the study group were better than the control group after 3 months of treatment and half a year after treatment. The difference was statistically significant (P <0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in the quality of life scores between the two groups (P>0.05). After treatment, the quality of life scores was significantly higher than the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). For patients with vascular dementia after cerebral infarction, piracetam combined with nimodipine can improve the cognitive function, improve the quality of life, and have a significant clinical effect.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:  Ischemia-reperfusion injury plays an important role in flap failure. Ischemic preconditioning technique is the only proven method for preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury, but it is not used widely in daily practice because of difficulties such as prolonging the operation time, need for surgical experience, and increasing the risk of complications. This study has been performed with the assumption that piracetam may be a simple and inexpensive alternative to the preconditioning technique due to its antioxidant, antiaggregant, rheological, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, cytoprotective, and immune modulating effects. METHODS:  Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups and latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flaps were raised. No extra procedure was applied, and no treatment was given to the control group. Four hours of ischemia was created by clamping the thoracodorsal pedicle in the second group. The animals in the third group were treated with 10 minutes of ischemia and reperfusion periods as a preconditioning procedure before the 4 hours of ischemia. Animals in the fourth group received systemic piracetam 30 minutes before and 6 days after reperfusion. Nitric oxide and myeloperoxidase levels in serum and tissue, acute inflammatory cell response, and vascular proliferation in tissue were examined at the postoperative 24th hour and 10th day. RESULTS:  Myeloperoxidase activity in both preconditioning and piracetam groups, was significantly lower than the ischemia-reperfusion group. Acute inflammatory cell response was similarly decreased in both preconditioning and piracetam groups compared with ischemia-reperfusion group. Tissue measurements of nitric oxide were also significantly higher in both preconditioning and piracetam groups than in the ischemia-reperfusion group. However, vascular proliferation increased in the preconditioning group, while it did not show any significant change in the piracetam group. CONCLUSION:  This study shows that systemic piracetam treatment provides protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in musculocutaneous flaps and can offer a simple and inexpensive alternative to the preconditioning technique.",

The effect of L-carnitine and piracetam in the reduction of myopathic symptomatology caused by exercise, as well as safety and tolerability were also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed on two different occasions, of which 42 subjects were investigated on occasion 1 and 19 on occasion 2. Discomfort or pain was evaluated according to modified Borg scale. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), creatine kinase (CK), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were evaluated on the 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th, and 32nd day after therapy, and before and until 4 hours after an exercise test performed on a treadmill on day 36. RESULTS: A higher incidence of pain or discomfort was observed in the control group than in the test group, mainly in occasion 1 (29% vs. 62% experienced pain or discomfort in any period, p = 0.0295). The serum levels of AST, ALT, and LDH were statistically different, with lower values in the test group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Concomitant use of L-carnitine and piracetam might have a muscle-protective effect and protection against simvastatin-induced myalgia. Furthermore, the formulation was safe and well tolerated by the subjects investigated in this trial.",

This is a retrospective study to compare the effectiveness of oral theophylline, piracetam, and iron treatments in children with simple BHS. A total of 146 children (75 girls and 71 boys) with simple BHS were included to this retrospective study. Children were divided into 4 groups: nontreated (no anemia and no treatment), oral theophylline (10 mg/kg/d as a single daily dose), piracetam (40 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses), and elementary iron (3 mg/kg/d as a single daily dose) treatments. Iron therapy had been given only in children with iron deficiency anemia. Neurologic, cardiologic, and biochemical evaluations were performed for all children. The majority of the patients had cyanotic spells (83.6%). The frequency of attacks/month was markedly decreased with iron (58.8%) and theophylline (82.9%) treatments, but not with piracetam therapy (8.8%) and nontreated group (4.7%). Satisfaction of the parents/caregivers was found to be high in the theophylline group (P < .001).

      "abstract": "Pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, both fail to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a considerable number of populations. The persistence of traumatic memories and deficit in extinction contributes to the failure of exposure therapy in PTSD. With the objective to enhance the outcomes of exposure therapy by targeting the extinction window using pharmacological agents in PTSD, the present study was aimed to explore the effect of piracetam, risperidone and their combinations in experimentally-induced PTSD-like phenotype in rats. Male SD rats were exposed to single prolonged stress model (SPS) for induction of PTSD-like behavioral changes. Piracetam, risperidone and their combination were used as therapeutic interventions while sertraline was used as a standard treatment for 14 days along with extinction training. Induction of PTSD-like behaviors were assessed in behavioral tests such as fear conditioning, elevated plus maze, social interaction test, and the marble burying test. Neurotransmitters (dopamine and serotonin and their metabolites), BDNF, proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), caspase-3, and markers for oxidative stress were assessed in the hippocampus and cortex while corticosterone and nitrite levels were estimated in plasma. Our result indicated that the SPS paradigm efficiently induced PTSD-like phenotype in rats. Risperidone and piracetam were found to be effective alone, while their high dose combination, produced potentiating effect in reversing the extinction deficit, behavioral alterations, altered cortical and hippocampal BDNF, IL-6, TNF-α, caspase-3, oxidative stress markers, and neurotransmitter levels. Plasma corticosterone and nitrite levels were also found to be reversed in the combination treated groups. Our preliminary study suggests that piracetam, risperidone and their combination restored the physiological cascades in cortex and hippocampus along with successful suppression of fear memory and a symptom cluster of PTSD-like phenotype in rats. Hence they could be used as an effective adjunct to enhance the outcome of exposure therapy for the management of PTSD.",

Several studies have supported the hypothesis that oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are the main pathogenic factors in vascular dementia. This current study aims to determine the possible neuroprotective effects of zafirlukast, piracetam and the combination of piracetam and zafirlukast on L-methionine-induced vascular dementia in rats. Male Wistar albino rats were divided into five groups. Group I was the normal control, and group II received L-methionine (1700 mg/kg, P.O.) for 32 days. The remaining groups received zafirlukast (20 mg/kg, P.O.), piracetam (600 mg/kg, P.O.) or their combination (zafirlukast 20 mg/kg + piracetam 600 mg/kg, P.O.) for 32 days after L-methionine administration. Afterwards, the cognitive and memory performances of the rats were investigated using the novel object recognition (NOR) test; rats were then sacrificed for histopathological and biochemical analyses. L-methionine-induced vascular dementia altered rats' behaviours and the brain contents of different neurotransmitters and acetylcholinesterase activity while increasing levels of oxidative stress and causing notable histopathological alterations in brain tissues. The treatment of vascular dementia with zafirlukast and the combination improved neurochemical, behavioural and histological alterations to a comparable level to those of piracetam. Thus, zafirlukast, piracetam and the combination of both drugs can be considered as potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of vascular dementia induced by L-methionine. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the neuroprotective effects of zafirlukast and piracetam on L-methionine-induced vascular dementia.",

MAIN METHODS: The fabrication and characterization of nanoformulations (microemulsion, liposomes, ethosomes, transfersomes and transethosomes) coencapsulating two cognitive enhancers; piracetam and vinpocetine delivered intranasally, in addition to a novel nanocomposite microemulsion/vesicular nanoformulation was described. KEY FINDINGS: Formulations delivered the drugs across sheep nasal mucosa, with cumulative percentage reaching 29.99% for vinpocetine and 57.78% for piracetam. While the solution form of the drugs was totally ineffective, the selected transethosomal, microemulsion and nanocomposite formulations reversed the scopolamine induced effect on the step through latency of passive avoidance test and the spontaneous alternation behavior in Y maze test, further confirmed by histopathlogical examination. All three nanoformulations significantly decreased the acetylcholinesterase activity and the extent of lipid peroxidation by 32-42%. The nanocomposite formulation was superior to the microemulsion and transethosomal formulations in its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects, delineated by higher extent of inhibition of COX-2 and caspase 3 expression respectively. SIGNIFICANCE: Results support the hypothesis that the novel microemulsion/vesicular nanocomposite system is a promising neuroprotective modality for intranasal brain targeting which is worthy of exploitation in other brain diseases.",

This study was conducted to compare oral betahistine and oral piracetam in management of outpatients with peripheral vertigo. METHODS: This was a randomized clinical trial performed on patients who were presented to the EDs of 4 teaching hospitals, with complaint of true vertigo. Patients were randomly allocated to either betahistine or piracetam group and their 7-day outcomes were compared. RESULTS: 100 cases with the mean age of 54.72 ± 14.09 years were randomly allocated to either group (62.0% female). The two groups were similar regarding age, sex, and intensity of symptom at the time of presenting to the ED. Twelve (24%) patients in piracetam group and 6 (12%) patients in betahistine group experienced adverse events (odds ratio: 2.32, CI 95%: 0.79-6.76; p = 0.125). There were 3 (6%) patients in each group that experienced a recurrence of their symptoms and 2 (4%) patients in each group saw another physician for vertigo. CONCLUSION: Oral piracetam is a potentially proper treatment for management of peripheral vertigo and there are few adverse effects associated with it."

This observational retrospective study was conducted by enrolling patients based on 2483 stroke registration data cohorts from a 1200-bed regional Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital, located in central Taiwan from 1 January 1 2011 to 31 December 2015. Patients were excluded if they had intravenous a thrombolytic agent within 3 hours of symptoms onset (n = 49), incomplete or erroneous NIHSS scores (n = 953), or transient ischemia stroke (n = 130). Logistic regression model was applied for associating piracetam treatment and clinical characteristics with NIHSS score changes between admission and discharge, and subgroup analysis to assess the conditions under which piracetam can be used. Multivariate analysis revealed NIHSS scores improvement in atrial fibrillation, large-artery atherosclerosis, underweight, current smoker, ex-smoker, and piracetam. Subgroup analysis showed piracetam is beneficial in the following: age ≥75 years olds, males, those of normal weight, those who are obese, ex-smokers, those with hypertension, dyslipidemia, those without diabetes mellitus, nor atrial fibrillation. The selection of the conditions under which piracetam treatment should be given, and clinical characteristics, is important for NIHSS improvement of ischemic stroke patients in Taiwan."

Albumin is the most susceptible to glycation plasma protein. Modified albumin by AGEs may be more resistant to enzymatic degradation, which further increases the local accumulation of AGEs in tissues. The aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro glycation of serum albumin in the presence of piracetam (PIR) and the gliclazide (GLZ)-glycated albumin interaction. The analysis of PIR as an inhibitor and GLZ interaction with nonglycated human albumin (HSA) and glycated by fructose human albumin (gHSAFRC), in the absence and presence of piracetam (gHSAFRC-PIR), was performed by fluorescence quenching of macromolecules. On the basis of obtained data we concluded that under the influence of glycation, association constant ( K a ) of gliclazide to human serum albumin decreases and GLZ binds to HSA with less strength than under physiological conditions. PIR strongly inhibited the formation of AGEs in the system where the efficiency of HSA glycation was the largest. The analysis of piracetam influence on the GLZ-glycated albumin interaction has shown that piracetam increases the binding strength of GLZ to glycated albumin and weakens its therapeutic effect. Based on the obtained data we concluded that monitoring therapy and precautions are required in the treatment when the combinations of gliclazide and piracetam are used at the same time.",

In this work the relative stability of piracetam polymorphs depending on the temperature was studied using the ssNMR spectroscopy combined with ab initio DFT calculations. The ssNMR spectroscopy enabled the analysis of polymorphic phase transition in the case of pure active substance as well as polymorphic form identification in the analysis of the commercial solid dosage formulations. Quantum chemical calculations of phonon density of states were performed to obtain the temperature dependence of the enthalpy, entropy and free energy of the piracetam polymorphs in a quasi-harmonic approximation. GIPAW NMR calculations combined with molecular dynamics were performed to support the chemical shift assignment. The obtained results showed that DFT calculations can be used not only to obtain the NMR parameters but also to predict the influence of the temperature on the stability order of the polymorphic forms of molecular crystals.",

Piracetam, a nootropic agent has been reported to show several other neuropharmacological properties. The present study, evaluated the pharmacological effect of piracetam (200 mg/kg i.p.) on BED in female rats, induced by free access to palatable cookies for 2 h on alternate days. BED was confirmed by an increase in binge eating behavior and weight gain. BED leads to anxiety, cognitive and memory deficits, as evaluated by EPM (Elevated plus maze), OFT (open field test), and Y-maze tests. Increased levels of plasma corticosterone (CORT), glutamate in nucleus accumbens (NAC), hypothalamus (HYP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) indicate stress and excitotoxicity. Moreover, it was observed that the levels of dopamine were higher in NAC and PFC, and less in HYP which may be responsible for motivational behavior for palatable feeding and cognitive deficits. More surprisingly, feeding behaviour regulating hormones namelyleptin was increased and ghrelin level was decreased in BED. Further, level of acetylcholine which regulates cognitive behaviour was compromised in BED. Piracetam significantly decreased binge eating behavior and associated body weight and regulated the levels of concerned neurotransmitters in respective regions. However, piracetam did not alter normal feeding behavior in the fast-refed model. Further, piracetam showed brain region-specific decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Piracetam showed anxiolytic activity and also alleviated cognitive deficit observed in BED. Hence, preclinical evidence indicates the potential use of piracetam for the treatment of BED.",

LPS administration also caused augmented expression of inflammatory cytokines and astrocytes activation. Piracetam treatment offered significant protection against LPS induced oxidative and inflammatory parameters and inhibited astrocytes activation. LPS administration caused augmented level of reactive oxygen species and depleted mitochondrial membrane potential which were attenuated with piracetam treatment. This study for the first time demonstrates the role of caspase independent death factors in piracetam induced neuroprotective effects in rat brain. Translocation of mitochondrial resident apoptosis inducing factor and endonuclease G to nucleus through cytosol after LPS administration was significantly blocked with piracetam treatment. Further, LPS induced DNA fragmentation along with up regulated Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) levels were also inhibited with piracetam treatment. Apoptotic death was confirmed by the cleavage of caspase 3 as well as histological alteration in rat brain regions. LPS administration caused significantly increased level of cleaved caspase 3, altered neuronal morphology and decreased neuronal density which were restored with piracetam treatment. Collectively our findings indicate that piracetam offered protection against LPS induced inflammatory responses and cellular death including its antioxidative antiapoptotic activity with its attenuation against mitochondria mediated caspase independent pathway.",

In this study, we investigated whether pre-treatment with either L-carnitine or piracetam could protect cells from undergoing apoptosis after sonoporation and the possible mechanisms. We found that either L-carnitine or piracetam can promote gene transfection without reducing cell viability, possibly by reducing cavitation-induced reactive oxygen species generation, reversing alterations of mitochondrial membrane potential, preventing caspase-3/7 activity and facilitating mitochondrial ATP production.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of mitochondrion-specific factors of caspase-independent pathway like apoptotic-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease-G (endo-G) in piracetam-induced neuroprotection. N2A cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exhibited significant cytotoxicity, impaired mitochondrial activity, and reactive oxygen species generation which was significantly attenuated with piracetam co-treatment. Cells co-treated with LPS and piracetam exhibited significant uptake of piracetam in comparison to only piracetam-treated cells as estimated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS). LPS treatment caused significant translocation of AIF and endonuclease-G in neuronal N2A cells which were significantly attenuated with piracetam co-treatment. Significant over-expression of proinflammatory cytokines was also observed after treatment of LPS to cells which was inhibited with piracetam co-treatment demonstrating its anti-inflammatory property. LPS-treated cells exhibited significant oxidative DNA fragmentation and poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase-1 (PARP-1) up-regulation in nucleus, both of which were attenuated with piracetam treatment. Antioxidant melatonin but not z-VAD offered the inhibited LPS-induced DNA fragmentation indicating the involvement of oxidative DNA fragmentation. Further, we did not observe the altered caspase-3 level after LPS treatment initially while at a later time point, significantly augmented level of caspase-3 was observed which was not inhibited with piracetam treatment. In total, our findings indicate the interference of piracetam in mitochondrion-mediated caspase-independent pathway, as well as its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties.

      "abstract": "Excessive ethanol (EtOH) intake, especially to prenatal exposure, can significantly affect cognitive function and cause permanent learning and memory injures in children. As a result, how to protect children from EtOH neurotoxicity has gained increasing attention in recent years. Piracetam (Pir) is a nootropic drug derived from c-aminobutyric acid and can manage cognition impairments in multiple neurological disorders. Studies have shown that Pir can exert therapeutic effects on EtOH-induced memory impairments, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we found that Pir inhibited ethanol-induced memory deficit by mediating multiple pathways. Treatment with EtOH could cause cognitive deficit in juvenile rats, and triggered the alteration of synaptic plasticity. Administration with Pir significantly increased long-term potentiation and protected hippocampus neurons from EtOH neurotoxicity. Pir intervention ameliorated EtOH-induced cell apoptosis and inhibited the activation of Caspase-3 in vitro, suggesting that Pir protected neurons by anti-apoptotic effects. Pir could decrease the expression of LC3-II and Beclin-1 induced by EtOH, and increase the phosphorylation of mTOR and reduce the phosphorylation of Akt, which suggested that the protective effect of Pir was involved in regulation of autophagic process and mTOR/Akt pathways. In conclusion, we speculate that Pir reduces EtOH-induced neuronal damage by regulation of apoptotic action and autophagic action, and our research offers preclinical evidence for the application of Pir in ethanol toxicity.",

Press and internet reports indicate that the use of piracetam, as a heroin adulterant, has spread rapidly in some countries, especially in Asia and Europe. Its use, as adulterant, is believed to produce more profound desirable effects, while decreasing hangover. Recent surveys demonstrated that piracetam protects neurons from heroin-induced apoptosis. The protective role of this adulterating substance may be related to restoration of beta-endorphin levels and to its neuroprotective effects. The aim of this paper is to review the relevant literature and suggest the main hypothetical mechanisms that justify its use as a heroin adulterant, try to understand if its use could help people who want to come off heroin by reducing withdrawal symptoms and, finally, give useful information that permit us to understand why drug trafficking organisations started to use piracetam as heroin adulterant.",

Neuroinflammation was induced by a single dose of LPS solution infused into each of the lateral cerebral ventricles in concentrations of 1 μg/μl, at a rate of 1 μl/min over a 5-min period, with a 5-min waiting period between the two infusions. Piracetam in doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg i.p. was administered 30 min before LPS infusion and continued for 9 days. On ninth day, the behavioral test for memory and anxiety was done followed by blood collection and microdissection of the hippocampus (HIP) and prefrontal cortex brain regions. Piracetam attenuated the LPS-induced decrease in coping strategy to novel environment indicating anxiolytic activity. It also reversed the LPS-induced changes in the known arm and novel arm entries in the Y-maze test indicating amelioration of spatial memory impairment. Further, piracetam moderated LPS-induced decrease in the mitochondrial complex enzyme activities (I, II, IV, and V) and mitochondrial membrane potential. It ameliorated changes in hippocampal lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels including the activity of superoxide dismutase. Piracetam region specifically ameliorated LPS-induced increase in the level of IL-6 in HIP indicating anti-neuroinflammatory effect. Further, piracetam reduced HIP Aβ (1-40) and increased blood Aβ level suggesting efflux of Aβ from HIP to blood. Therefore, the present study indicates preclinical evidence for the use of piracetam in the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aphasia is a common symptom in post-stroke patients. Piracetam is a commonly used nootropic agent that promises various benefits to brain function, including language improvement. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether piracetam facilitates the rehabilitation of language performance in post-stroke patients. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of piracetam treatment in post-stroke patients published in any language were included, excluding those involving pre-existing cognitive disorders such as dementia and mood disturbances. We searched several databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO for RCTs published up to 31 December 2015. We conducted a meta-analysis using RevMan (version 5.3), with standardized mean differences (SMDs) and fixed-effect models, and used StataSE (version 13) for the detection of publication bias. This study has been submitted to PROSPERO, and its registration number is CRD42016034088. RESULTS: We identified 1180 titles and abstracts, and finally included seven RCTs in this meta-analysis. The number of participants in each study ranged from 19 to 66, summing up to 261 patients overall. The dose of piracetam was consistent while the frequency and time of therapy varied. The assessment of the language at the end of trials showed no significant improvement in overall severity of aphasia [SMD 0.23, 95 % confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.49, P = 0.08], but written language (SMD 0.35, 95 % CI 0.04 to 0.66, P = 0.03) showed pronounced improvement. Subgroup analyses indicated a dissociation of effectiveness between short- and long-term assessment in overall severity (P = 0.008, I (2) = 85.6 %) in terms of tests for subgroup differences, and a mild trend toward dissociation in written subtests (P = 0.30, I (2) = 5.1 %). Funnel plots and Egger's test identified no obvious publication bias in the primary variable. CONCLUSIONS: Piracetam plays a limited role in the rehabilitation of overall language impairment and only benefits written language ability at the end of trials. Its effect on overall linguistic level and written language tends to emerge within a short period and declines thereafter.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is one of the most common genetic disorders. Sickle cell crises in which irregular and dehydrated cells contribute to blocking of blood vessels are characterised by episodes of pain. Treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic. In vitro studies with piracetam indicate that it has the potential for inhibition and a reversal of the process of sickling of erythrocytes. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of piracetam for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Last search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 21 September 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing orally administered piracetam to placebo or standard care in people, of all ages and both sexes, with sickle cell disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Trial authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects data were collected from the trials. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials involving 169 participants were included in the review. A limited amount of data addressing some of the primary and some of the secondary outcomes were provided, but data were incomplete and based on un-validated assumptions used in the evaluation of outcomes. One trial reported a reduction in the number of pain crises and their severity with active intervention than placebo but presented no data to confirm these results. A second trial presented a monthly global pain score based on the number of sickle cell crises and severity of pain but included no separate data for these primary outcomes. Although there was no significant difference between the piracetam and placebo periods for the number of days of hospitalisation (P = 0.87) in one trial, inconsistencies in the criteria necessary for hospitalisation during sickle crises did not permit accurate conclusions to be drawn. Two of the trials reported participant satisfaction with piracetam but provided no details as to how this satisfaction had been assessed. There were no reports of toxicity or adverse effects with piracetam other than one participant who experienced dizziness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The small number of included trials and their poor methodological quality provided insufficient reliable evidence to support the routine use of this medication for preventing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises.We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new trials are published.",

The present study was designed to determine the effect of systemic and topical administration of piracetam and nimodipine on full-thickness skin burn wound healing. A total of 36 New Zealand male rabbits were divided into six groups. Full-thickness skin burns were produced in all the groups, except the control group. Piracetam was administered systemically (piracetam-IV) and topically (piracetam-C) for 14 days, and nimodipine was administered systemically (nimodipine-IV) and topically (nimodipine-C) over the burn wounds for 14 days. The sham group underwent burn injury but was not administered any drug. After 21 days, gross examination and histopathological analysis were performed and the results were compared statistically. Nimodipine-C and nimodipine-IV had no effect on burn wound healing. However, both piracetam-IV and piracetam-C significantly enhanced the healing of the full-thickness skin burn wounds, although the latter was more effective, useful and practical in burn wound healing. The histopathological features of the wounds in the piracetam-C group were closer to those of the control group than those of the other groups. Piracetam-C rather than piracetam-IV may promote full-thickness burn wound healing in rabbits.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This subanalysis compared the efficacy of betahistine plus piracetam dual therapy versus betahistine monotherapy using data from OSVaLD, a 3 month, open-label, observational study conducted in 2272 patients with peripheral vestibular vertigo. Of the 1898 patients included in the original efficacy population, 1076 were from countries where betahistine plus piracetam dual therapy was prescribed to >1 patient; 114 of these 1076 patients (11%) received the dual therapy and 567 (53%) were treated with betahistine monotherapy; these patients were selected for analysis. METHODS: Efficacy was assessed using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) total and subscale scores. Propensity-score matching was used to correct potential differences in patient baseline characteristics between treatment groups. In addition, a subgroup analysis evaluated 103 patients treated with betahistine because of insufficient efficacy with their existing treatment. RESULTS: In the propensity-score matched, total-population evaluation, improvements in the DHI total and subscale scores were numerically greater in the betahistine plus piracetam group (n = 88) versus the betahistine group (n = 89) (DHI total, -42.9 vs. -37.6, respectively; DHI physical, -12.1 vs. -10.4; DHI emotional, -13.5 vs. -13.2) and statistically significant for the DHI functional score (-17.3 vs. -14.0, respectively, p = 0.01). The percentage of patients with no impairment at final visit was 27% with betahistine and 47% with betahistine plus piracetam; odds ratio: 2.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-2.4 (p = 0.007). Similar results were obtained in the subgroup analyses for patients whose current vertigo treatment was insufficient. The overall incidence of adverse events was low and similar in both groups, and there were no discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: By using propensity-score matching, which controls for potential heterogeneity in patient baseline characteristics and small patient numbers, the results of this analysis suggest that combined betahistine and piracetam may be more effective than betahistine alone in patients with peripheral vestibular vertigo.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Piracetam is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor that has been used in the treatment of cognitive disorders for decades. Recent surveys and drug analyses have demonstrated that a heroin mixture adulterated with piracetam has spread rapidly in heroin addicts in China, but its addictive properties and the damage it causes to the central neural system are currently unknown. METHODS: The effect of piracetam on the reward properties of heroin was assessed by conditioned place preference (CPP). Electron microscopy and radioimmunoassay were used to compare the effects of heroin mixed with equivalent piracetam (HP) and heroin alone on neuronal apoptosis and the levels of beta-endorphin (β-EP) in different brain subregions within the corticolimbic system, respectively. RESULTS: Piracetam significantly enhanced heroin-induced CPP expression while piracetam itself didn't induce CPP. Morphological observations showed that HP-treated rats had less neuronal apoptosis than heroin-treated group. Interestingly, HP normalized the levels of β-EP in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and core of the nucleus accumbens (AcbC) subregions, in where heroin-treated rats showed decreased levels of β-EP. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that piracetam potentiate the heroin-induced CPP and protect neurons from heroin-induced apoptosis. The protective role of HP might be related to the restoration of β-EP levels by piracetam. Our findings may provide a potential interpretation for the growing trend of HP abuse in addicts in China.",

The present study was conducted to assess the effects of piracetam on rotenone induced oxidative stress by using both ex vivo and in vivo test systems. Rats were treated with piracetam (600 mg/kg b.w. oral) for seven constitutive days prior to rotenone administration (intracerebroventricular, 12 µg) in rat brain. Rotenone induced oxidative stress was assessed after 1 h and 24 h of rotenone administration. Ex vivo estimations were performed by using two experimental designs. In one experimental design the rat brain homogenate was treated with rotenone (1 mM, 2 mM and 4 mM) and rotenone+piracetam (10 mM) for 1 h. While in second experimental design the rats were pretreated with piracetam for seven consecutive days. On eighth day the rats were sacrificed, brain homogenate was prepared and treated with rotenone (1 mM, 2 mM and 4mM) for 1h. After treatment the glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were estimated in brain homogenate. In vivo study showed that pretreatment of piracetam offered significant protection against rotenone induced decreased GSH and increased MDA level though the protection was region specific. But the co-treatment of piracetam with rotenone did not offer significant protection against rotenone induced oxidative stress in ex vivo study. Whereas ex vivo experiments in rat brain homogenate of piracetam pretreated rats, showed the significant protection against rotenone induced oxidative stress. Findings indicated that pretreatment of piracetam significantly attenuated the rotenone induced oxidative stress though the protection was region specific. Piracetam treatment to rats led to its absorption and accumulation in different brain regions as assessed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. In conclusion, study indicates the piracetam is able to enhance the antioxidant capacity in brain cells in region specific manner. The study is also revealing the rationale for its clinical use in cognitive impairment and other neurological diseases.",

Transfer latency in elevated plus maze (EPM) and time spent in target quadrant in Morris water maze (MWM) were recorded. Estimation of brain monoamines in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and whole brain were done using HPLC with fluorescence detector. Piracetam treated group showed significant decrease in transfer latency in EPM and increase in time spent in target quadrant recorded in MWM. Combination treated group failed to produce statistically significant nootropic effect in both EPM and MWM. Combination treated group failed to increase brain monoamine levels when compared against duloxetine and piracetam treated groups, separately. But there was exception of significant increase in norepinephrine levels in hippocampi when compared against duloxetine treated group. Results indicate no cognitive benefits with piracetam plus duloxetine combination. These findings can be further probed with the aim of understanding the interaction between duloxetine and piracetam as a future endeavor."

METHODS: A blinded, parallel group, superiority, randomised clinical trial was carried out on patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with vertigo. Healthy adult patients presenting to the ED with undifferentiated vertigo were included in the study. The efficacy of intravenous dimenhydrinate (100 mg) and intravenous piracetam (2000 mg) for reducing the intensity of vertigo was compared in two randomised treatment groups using a 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS). The determination of NRS scores was performed at presentation and at the 30th minute of presentation, after the study drug was implemented, both in immobile and ambulatory positions. The primary outcome variable was reduction in vertigo intensity documented on the NRS at the 30th minute after medication administration, analysed by intention to treat. RESULTS: A total of 94 patients were included in the randomisation (n=47 in both groups). The baseline NRS scores were 7.55±2.00 in the dimenhydrinate group and 8.19±1.79 in the piracetam group. The changes from baseline for dimenhydrinate and piracetam were 2.92±3.11 and 3.75±3.40 (difference -0.83 (95% CI -2.23 to 0.57)) in the immobile position and were 2.04±3.07 and 2.72±2.91 (difference -0.68 (95% CI -2.03 to 0.67)) in the ambulatory position. Rescue medication need was similar in both treatment groups (p=0.330), and only one adverse reaction was reported. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a difference between dimenhydrinate and piracetam in relieving the symptoms of vertigo. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinical Trials Registration ID: NCT01890538.",

      "abstract": "This study was performed to investigate the involvement of mitochondrion-specific endonuclease G in piracetam (P)-induced protective mechanisms. Studies have shown the antiapoptotic effects of piracetam but the mechanism of action of piracetam is still an enigma. To assess the involvement of endonuclease G in piracetam-induced protective effects, astrocyte glial cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and piracetam. LPS treatment caused significantly decreased viability, mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation, which were attenuated by piracetam cotreatment. Cotreatment of astrocytes with piracetam showed its significantly time-dependent absorption as observed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Astrocytes treated with piracetam alone showed enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in comparison to control astrocytes. However, in LPS-treated cells no significant alteration in MMP was observed in comparison to control cells. Protein and mRNA levels of the terminal executor of the caspase-mediated pathway, caspase-3, were not altered significantly in LPS or LPS + piracetam-treated astrocytes, whereas endonuclease G was significantly translocated to the nucleus in LPS-treated astrocytes. Piracetam cotreatment attenuated the LPS-induced endonuclease G translocation. In conclusion this study indicates that LPS treatment of astrocytes caused decreased viability, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, chromatin condensation, DNA damage, and translocation of endonuclease G to the nucleus, which was inhibited by piracetam cotreatment, confirming that the mitochondrion-specific endonuclease G is one of the factors involved in piracetam-induced protective mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Despite immense advances in the treatment strategies, management of neuropathic pain remains unsatisfactory. Piracetam is a prototype of nootropic drugs, used to improve cognitive impairment. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of piracetam on peripheral neuropathic pain in rats. Neuropathic pain was induced by the chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve. Following this, piracetam was intraperitoneally administered for 2 weeks in doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, and pain was assessed by employing the behavioural tests for thermal hyperalgesia (hot plate and tail flick tests) and cold allodynia (acetone test). After the induction of neuropathic pain, significant development of thermal hyperalgesia and cold allodynia was observed. The administration of piracetam (50 mg/kg) did not have any significant effect on all the behavioural tests. Further, piracetam (100 mg/kg) also had no effect on the hot plate and tail flick tests; however it significantly decreased the paw withdrawal duration in the acetone test. Piracetam in a dose of 200 mg/kg significantly modulated neuropathic pain as observed from the increased hot plate and tail flick latencies, and decreased paw withdrawal duration (in acetone test). Therefore, the present study suggests the potential use of piracetam in the treatment of neuropathic pain, which merits further clinical investigation.",

To explore the precise mechanism, the present study further evaluated effects of piracetam on Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal damage in rat primary cortical cells. The addition of piracetam to the cultured cells 12 h before OGD for 4 h significantly reduced neuronal damage as determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and lactate dehydrogenase release experiments. Piracetam also lowered the levels of malondialdehyde, nitrogen monoxidum, and xanthine oxidase which was increased in the OGD cells, and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, which were decreased in the OGD cells. We also demonstrated that piracetam could decrease glutamate and aspartate release when cortical cells were subjected to OGD. Furthermore, Western blot study demonstrated that piracetam attenuated the increased expression of P53 and BAX protein in OGD cells. These observations demonstrated that piracetam reduced OGD-induced neuronal damage by inhibiting the oxidative stress and decreasing excitatory amino acids release and lowering P53/Bax protein expression in OGD cells.",

The present meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the protective effect of piracetam on the cognitive performance of patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The relevant studies were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library up to June 2013 and the pertinent bibliographies from the retrieved studies were reviewed. Data were selected from the studies according to predefined criteria. The meta-analysis included two randomized control trials involving 184 patients and including the Syndrom-Kurz test (SKT). Findings of the meta-analysis showed that following treatment the change from baseline observed in five SKT subtest scores, conducted with piracetam patients, indicated a significant advantage over those patients that were in the placebo group. The subtests included immediate pictured object recall, weighted mean difference (WMD)=0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-1.31, P<0.00001; delayed pictured object recall, WMD=0.74, 95% CI 0.19-1.28, P=0.008; delayed picture recognition, WMD=0.82, 95% CI 0.31-1.31, P=0.001; immediate word recall, WMD=0.87, 95% CI 0.47-1.28, P<0.0001; and letter interference, WMD=3.46, 95% CI -5.69 to -1.23, P=0.002. These results indicated that piracetam may have been effective in improving the short-term cognitive performance of patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. High quality, well-controlled and longer randomized trials are required to corroborate this result."

METHODS: This double-blind study comprised a total of 200 patients, aged between 18 and 70 years, who had presented to the emergency department of Ankara Training and Research Hospital and were diagnosed with peripheral vertigo. Evaluation of the severity of the patients' vertigo was performed using a visual analogue scale, before and after drug administration. RESULTS: Both drugs were found to be effective (p < 0.001) and had comparable effects (p < 0.474). Dimenhydrinate was also found to have about two times the side effects of piracetam. Drowsiness was found to be the most common side effect of these two drugs. CONCLUSION: Dimenhydrinate and piracetam have similar levels of effectiveness with regard to acute vertigo. We conclude that piracetam, which has fewer side effects than dimenhydrinate, better vestibular compensation, and is effective for both acute and chronic vertigo, could be more frequently used in the emergency treatment of acute vertigo.",

Neurological/behavioral functions (cognitive and motor), endogenous defense systems (lipid peroxidation, glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase), reduced water content and infarct size and histopathological alterations were then studied. KEY FINDINGS: Silymarin and PCA treatments significantly improved cognitive, motor and endogenous defense functions, histopathological alterations, and, reduced both water content and infarct size compared to the vehicle-treated ischemic control group. Piracetam treatment improved neurological and histopathological alterations, reduced water content and infarct size, but failed to restore/prevent the impaired endogenous defense functions significantly. SIGNIFICANCE: Silymarin showed better neuroprotection than piracetam and PCA in experimentally induced global ischemic/reperfusion and was able to facilitate mnemonic performance.",

Inflammatory pain is the result of a process that depends on neutrophil migration, cytokines and prostanoids release and oxidative stress. We analyze whether piracetam has anti-nociceptive effects and its mechanisms. Per oral pretreatment with piracetam reduced in a dose-dependent manner the overt pain-like behavior induced by acetic acid, phenyl-p-benzoquinone, formalin and complete Freund's adjuvant. Piracetam also diminished carrageenin-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, myeloperoxidase activity, and TNF-α-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. Piracetam presented analgesic effects as post-treatment and local paw treatment. The analgesic mechanisms of piracetam were related to inhibition of carrageenin- and TNF-α-induced production of IL-1β as well as prevention of carrageenin-induced decrease of reduced glutathione, ferric reducing ability and free radical scavenging ability in the paw. These results demonstrate that piracetam presents analgesic activity upon a variety of inflammatory stimuli by a mechanism dependent on inhibition of cytokine production and oxidative stress. Considering its safety and clinical use for cognitive function, it is possible that piracetam represents a novel perspective of analgesic.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty male rats were divided into 6 groups of 10 rats each. The groups were administered vehicle, control (rotenone, 1.5 mg/kg/48 h/6 doses, s.c.), PIR (100 and 200 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and VIN (3 and 6 mg/kg/day, p.o.). The motor performance of the rats was evaluated by the open field and pole test. Striatal dopamine level, malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were assayed. Histopathological study of the substantia nigra was also done. RESULTS: Results showed that rotenone-treated rats exhibited bradykinesia and motor impairment in the open-field test. In addition, GSH level was decreased whereas MDA and TNF-α increased in striata of rotenone-treated rats as compared to vehicle-treated rats. Marked degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) neurons and depletion of striatal dopamine was also observed in the rotenone-treated rats. Treatment with PIR or VIN significantly reversed the locomotor deficits and increased striatal dopamine level. Treatment with VIN significantly (P<0.05) reduced the striatal level of MDA and GSH in comparison to rotenone group whereas TNF-α production was found to be significantly decreased in PIR group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: VIN and PIR exhibit neuroprotective activity in rotenone-induced Parkinsonism. Hence, these nootropic agents may be considered as possible candidates in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

MATERIALS & METHODS: In this randomized double blind clinical trial study, 150 children with severe BHS referred to our pediatric outpatient service were enrolled from August 2011 to July 2012. The patients were randomized into two equal groups. One received 40mg/kg/day piracetam and the other group received placebo, twice daily. Patients were followed monthly for three months. The number of attacks/month before and after treatment were documented. RESULTS: Of the enrolled patients, 86 were boys. The mean age of the patients was 17 months (range, 6 to 24 months). In the piracetam group, 1 month after treatment an 81% response to treatment was found. In the placebo group, none of the patients had complete remission and 7% of the cases had partial remission. Overall, control of breath-holding spells was observed in 91% of the patients in the group taking piracetam as compared with 16% in the group taking placebo at the end of the study. There was no significant difference detected between the groups regarding the prevalence of drug side effects. CONCLUSION: A significant difference was detected between piracetam and placebo in prevention and controlling BHS. Piracetam (40mg/kg/day) had a good effect on our patients."

Patients in the allocation groups received liothyronine, piracetam, or placebo, from the first session of ECT until 1 month after the last session of ECT. Personal information, orientation, and mental control were tested in the participants at first, fourth, and last session of ECT and 1 month after the last session of ECT. Data were analyzed with Repeated measure ANOVA using SPSS 13. RESULTS: There wasn't any significant difference among three groups in demographic characteristics before the study and number of ECT sessions (P=0.684). After intervention, a significant difference in memory scores was seen in third and fourth assessment sessions (0.002). Orientation subscales showed a significant difference among four assessment sessions (P=0.001). Personal information and mental control never decreased in the liothyronine group. There was no significant difference among three studied groups in personal information, orientation, and mental control (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Memory changes due to ECT may be limited to some parts of memory like orientation. More powerful studies for comparison between the effect of liothyronine and placebo are necessary."

SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 15 May 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011), and ISI Science Citation Index (1981 to May 2011). We also contacted the manufacturer of piracetam to identify further published and unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing piracetam with control, with at least mortality reported and entry to the trial within three days of stroke onset. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality and this was checked by the other two review authors. We contacted study authors for missing information. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials involving 1002 patients, with one trial contributing 93% of the data. Participants' ages ranged from 40 to 85 years, and both sexes were equally represented. Piracetam was associated with a statistically non-significant increase in death at one month (approximately 31% increase, 95% confidence interval 81% increase to 5% reduction). This trend was no longer apparent in the large trial after correction for imbalance in stroke severity. Limited data showed no difference between the treatment and control groups for functional outcome, dependence or proportion of patients dead or dependent. Adverse effects were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some suggestion (but no statistically significant result) of an unfavourable effect of piracetam on early death, but this may have been caused by baseline differences in stroke severity in the trials. There is not enough evidence to assess the effect of piracetam on dependence.",

RESULTS: Dexamethasone and memantine had significant effects on the stria vascularis, organ of Corti and spiral ganglion (p < 0.05). Although piracetam decreased the apoptosis rate, this effect was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

Patients were followed monthly for a total period of 4 months. The numbers of attacks/month before and monthly after treatment were documented, and the overall number of attacks/month after treatment was calculated in both groups. The median number of attacks/month before treatment in the two groups was 5.5 and 5,respectively, while after the first month of treatment, it was 2 and 5, respectively. The median overall number of attacks/month after treatment in both groups was 1 and 5, respectively.There was a significant decline of number of attacks after piracetam treatment compared to placebo (p value<0.001).

Therefore, in the present study, in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro tests were conducted to investigate the effect of piracetam on leukocytes and macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes oxidative DNA damage; thus, in the present study, LPS was used as a tool to induce DNA damage. In vivo experiments were conducted on Sprague Dawley rats, and piracetam (600mg/kg, oral) was provided for five consecutive days. On the fifth day, a single injection of LPS (10mg/kg, i.p.) was administered. Three hours after LPS injection, blood leukocytes and peritoneal macrophages were collected and processed, and a variety of different assays were conducted. Ex vivo treatments were performed on isolated rat blood leukocytes, and in vitro experiments were conducted on rat macrophage cell line J774A.1. Cell viability and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and DNA damage were estimated in untreated (control) and piracetam-, LPS- and LPS+piracetam-treated leukocytes and macrophages. In vivo experiments revealed that rats pretreated with piracetam were significantly protected against LPS-induced increases in ROS levels and DNA damage. Ex vivo isolated leukocytes and J774A.1 cells treated with LPS exhibited augmented ROS levels and DNA damage, which were attenuated with piracetam treatment. Thus, the present study revealed the salutary effect of piracetam against LPS-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage in leukocytes and macrophages.",

Postoperative piracetam treatment was given for 7 days in Group 2. In Group 3, 4 hours of ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion were applied. I/R was applied to Group 4 and piracetam was given 30 minutes before reperfusion and postoperatively for 7 days. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure blood flow changes. VEGF expression was determined using immunohistochemical methods on tissue samples taken after the completion of 2 hours reperfusion in groups 3 and 4. Flap necrosis was measured on the day 7 in all groups. Blood flow rates did not show significant difference between piracetam treated and untreated I/R groups. Piracetam significantly reduced necrosis area both in ischemic and nonischemic flaps ( P < 0.05). VEGF expression was significantly increased in piracetam-treated Group 4 compared with Group 3 ( P = 0.005). This experimental study demonstrates that systemic piracetam treatment improves survival of pedicled flaps, reduces necrosis amounts, and increases VEGF expression in I/R induced flaps.",

Piracetam, an old drug with novel properties, has been shown to have mild beneficial effects on post-stroke aphasia. In the current study, we investigated the effects of 6 months treatment with piracetam on aphasia following stroke. Thirty patients with first-ever ischemic strokes and related aphasia were enrolled in the study. The scores for the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Gülhane Aphasia Test were recorded. The patients were scheduled randomly to receive either 4.8 g piracetam daily or placebo treatment for 6 months. At the end of 24 weeks, clinical assessments and aphasia tests were repeated. The level of improvement in the clinical parameters and aphasia scores was compared between the two groups. All patients had large lesions and severe aphasia. No significant difference was observed between the piracetam and placebo groups regarding the improvements in the NIHSS, BI and mRS scores at the end of the treatment. The improvements observed in spontaneous speech, reading fluency, auditory comprehension, reading comprehension, repetition, and naming were not significantly different in the piracetam and placebo groups, the difference reached significance only for auditory comprehension in favor of piracetam at the end of the treatment. Piracetam is well-tolerated in patients with post-stroke aphasia. Piracetam taken orally in a daily dose of 4.8 g for 6 months has no clear beneficial effect on post-stroke language disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by initiating a cascade of events from mitochondrial dysfunction to neuronal death. The metabolic enhancer piracetam has been shown to improve mitochondrial dysfunction following brain aging and experimentally induced oxidative stress. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used cell lines (PC12 and HEK cells) and murine dissociated brain cells. The protective effects of piracetam in vitro and ex vivo on Abeta-induced impairment of mitochondrial function (as mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production), on secretion of soluble Abeta and on neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells were investigated. KEY RESULTS: Piracetam improves mitochondrial function of PC12 cells and acutely dissociated brain cells from young NMRI mice following exposure to extracellular Abeta(1-42). Similar protective effects against Abeta(1-42) were observed in dissociated brain cells from aged NMRI mice, or mice transgenic for mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) treated with piracetam for 14 days. Soluble Abeta load was markedly diminished in the brain of those animals after treatment with piracetam. Abeta production by HEK cells stably transfected with mutant human APP was elevated by oxidative stress and this was reduced by piracetam. Impairment of neuritogenesis is an important consequence of Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and Abeta-induced reduction of neurite growth in PC12 cells was substantially improved by piracetam. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings strongly support the concept of improving mitochondrial function as an approach to ameliorate the detrimental effects of Abeta on brain function.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in nootropic drugs for the treatment of CNS disorders. Since the last meta-analysis of the clinical efficacy of piracetam, more information has accumulated. The primary objective of this systematic survey is to evaluate the clinical outcomes as well as the scientific literature relating to the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action, dosing, toxicology and adverse effects of marketed and investigational drugs. The major focus of the literature search was on articles demonstrating evidence-based clinical investigations during the past 10 years for the following therapeutic categories of CNS disorders: (i) cognition/memory; (ii) epilepsy and seizure; (iii) neurodegenerative diseases; (iv) stroke/ischaemia; and (v) stress and anxiety. In this article, piracetam-like compounds are divided into three subgroups based on their chemical structures, known efficacy and intended clinical uses. Subgroup 1 drugs include piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, pramiracetam and phenylpiracetam, which have been used in humans and some of which are available as dietary supplements. Of these, oxiracetam and aniracetam are no longer in clinical use. Pramiracetam reportedly improved cognitive deficits associated with traumatic brain injuries. Although piracetam exhibited no long-term benefits for the treatment of mild cognitive impairments, recent studies demonstrated its neuroprotective effect when used during coronary bypass surgery. It was also effective in the treatment of cognitive disorders of cerebrovascular and traumatic origins; however, its overall effect on lowering depression and anxiety was higher than improving memory. As add-on therapy, it appears to benefit individuals with myoclonus epilepsy and tardive dyskinesia. Phenylpiracetam is more potent than piracetam and is used for a wider range of indications. In combination with a vasodilator drug, piracetam appeared to have an additive beneficial effect on various cognitive disabilities. Subgroup 2 drugs include levetiracetam, seletracetam and brivaracetam, which demonstrate antiepileptic activity, although their cognitive effects are unclear. Subgroup 3 includes piracetam derivatives with unknown clinical efficacies, and of these nefiracetam failed to improve cognition in post-stroke patients and rolipram is currently in clinical trials as an antidepressant. The remaining compounds of this subgroup are at various preclinical stages of research. The modes of action of piracetam and most of its derivatives remain an enigma. Differential effects on subtypes of glutamate receptors, but not the GABAergic actions, have been implicated. Piracetam seems to activate calcium influx into neuronal cells; however, this function is questionable in the light of findings that a persistent calcium inflow may have deleterious impact on neuronal cells. Although subgroup 2 compounds act via binding to another neuronal receptor (synaptic vesicle 2A), some of the subgroup 3 compounds, such as nefiracetam, are similar to those of subgroup 1. Based on calculations of the efficacy rates, our assessments indicate notable improvements in clinical outcomes with some of these agents.",

      "abstract": "Glutamate receptors are the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the vertebrate central nervous system and are important potential drug targets for cognitive enhancement and the treatment of schizophrenia. Allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors promote dimerization by binding to a dimer interface and reducing desensitization and deactivation. The pyrrolidine allosteric modulators, piracetam and aniracetam, were among the first of this class of drugs to be discovered. We have determined the structure of the ligand binding domain of the AMPA receptor subtypes GluA2 and GluA3 with piracetam and a corresponding structure of GluA3 with aniracetam. Both drugs bind to GluA2 and GluA3 in a very similar manner, suggesting little subunit specificity. However, the binding sites for piracetam and aniracetam differ considerably. Aniracetam binds to a symmetrical site at the center of the dimer interface. Piracetam binds to multiple sites along the dimer interface with low occupation, one of which is a unique binding site for potential allosteric modulators. This new site may be of importance in the design of new allosteric regulators.",

The present study was designed to correlate the effect of propoxur, piracetam (a nootropic drug) and ascorbic acid (an antioxidant) on oxidative stress and cognitive function. Cognitive function was assessed using step-down latency (SDL) on a passive avoidance apparatus and transfer latency (TL) on elevated plus maze. Oxidative stress was assessed by examining brain malondialdehyde (MDA) and non-protein thiol (NP-SH) levels. A significant reduction in SDL and prolongation of TL was found for the propoxur-treated group at weeks 6 and 7 as compared with control (p<0.001). One week treatment by piracetam (400mg/kg/d, i.p.) or ascorbic acid (120mg/kg/d, i.p.) antagonized the effect of propoxur on SDL as well as TL. Both piracetam and ascorbic acid attenuated the propoxur-induced increase in brain MDA levels and decrease in brain NP-SH levels. Results of the present study show that ascorbic acid and piracetam have the potential to reverse cognitive dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by propoxur in the brain."

These patients were divided into four groups according to the treatment they received. The patients who had combined treatment constituted the first group; those who had combined treatment and piracetam the second; those who had combined treatment and acyclovir the third; those who had combined treatment, acyclovir, and piracetam the fourth group. RESULTS: For the four treatment groups, in the pre-and post-treatment (10th day) evaluation of the treatment efficiency made by calculation of the hearing thresholds in 250-8000 Hz frequencies, no significant difference between the groups was determined (p>0.05).

She had difficulty in writing because of action myoclonus in her arms. She also exhibited freezing gait and was unable to walk without cane. Although her gait disturbance resembled those seen in patients with parkinsonism secondary to anoxic encephalopathy, surface electromyography revealed that it was caused by action myoclonus in her legs. The presence of giant somatosensory evoked potentials and enhanced cortical reflexes in response to the electrical stimulation to her posterior tibial nerves supported our diagnosis. A combined therapy with valproate sodium, clonazepam and piracetam (15 g/day) was not effective. However, her freezing gait remarkably improved and she was able to walk without help, after the treatment with sufficient dose of piracetam (21 g/day). Cortical hyperexcitability as revealed by electrophysiological examination also improved. We concluded that the combined therapy with antiepileptic drugs and piracetam was effective in the treatment for action myoclonus. However, because the effects seemed dose-related, the dosage of piracetam needed to be increased until the optimum effects were obtained.",

According to immediate postoperative treatment, the study group received intravenous piracetam 30 mg kg(-1) and the control group--placebo. The cognitive functions were examined preoperatively and within 10 consecutive postoperative days using the ten-word memory test. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 123 children, the control one--of 127. Declines in memory indexes were observed in all anaesthetized patients. The most injured function was long-term memory. The intravenous administration of piracetam improved this cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: The study results confirm that general anaesthesia affects the memory function in children. Piracetam is effective for prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction after anaesthesia.",

For histopathological examination, brain tissue samples were obtained at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: The observed improvement in blood pressure and pulse rates in Group III was more than in Group II. Nitric oxide levels were increased in Group I; however, no correlation between piracetam and nitric oxide levels was determined. It was seen that recovery in brain damage in Group III was greater than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Piracetam, added to the treatment, may ecrease ischemic damage in hemorrhagic shock.",

Generally, no medical treatment is recommended and parental reassurance is believed to be enough, however, severe BHS can be very stressful for the parents and a pharmacological agent may be desired in some of these children. OBJECTIVE: In this prospective study aim was to determine the usefulness of piracetam as prophylactic treatment for severe BHS. METHODS: Children were recruited from Neurology Clinic in Children's Hospital, Islamabad between January 2002 to December 2004. Diagnosis of BHS was based on characteristic history and normal physical examination. Piracetam was prescribed to those children who were diagnosed as severe BHS in a dose ranging from 50-100 mg/kg/day. Iron supplements were added if hemoglobin was less than 10 gm%. Patients were seen at 2-4 weeks interval and follow-up was continued until 3 months after the cessation of drug therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-two children were enrolled in the study, 34 boys and 18 girls. Ages ranged from 4 weeks to 5 years with mean age of 17 months. In 81% of children, spells disappeared completely and in 9% frequency was reduced to less than one per month and of much lesser intensity. Prophylaxis was given for 3-6 months (mean 5) duration. CONCLUSIONS: Piracetam is an effective prophylactic treatment for severe BHS.",

Distilled water (control of neonatal pain stimulation) slightly reduced the audiogenic fit severity (arbitrary scores) the effect being most distinct in DBA/2J, less strong in 101/HY strain and absent in CBA. Caffeine neonatal injections induced slight changes in DBA/2J, no changes in CBA and increased SS in 101/HY mice. Piracetam reduced fit intensity in DBA/2J mice but increased it in CBA and, especially, in 101/HY strain.

These patients were divided into three groups: (1) group A (20 patients) in which the treatment began within the first hour after the AAT, (2) group B (17 patients) in which the treatment started more than 1 h later and less than 16 h after the AAT and (3) group C (15 patients) in which the treatment began after 24 h or more. One month after the treatment onset, 36 (69%) patients of all the groups showed hearing improvement (complete-partial recovery) in the pure tone audiometry. The greater number of patients who showed complete recovery after AAT was noted in group A (65%) compared to group B (23.5%) and C (13.3%). Moreover, in group A, in the final audiogram, the averaged hearing threshold was statistically better (P < 0.001) than that of groups B and C. In spite of the lack of control group, our data demonstrated the possible effectiveness of the immediate onset of treatment of AAT.",

There is no known treatment to prevent neuronal cell death in these disorders. Current treatment is purely symptomatic; ataxia is one of the most disabling symptoms and represents the main therapeutic challenge. A previous case report suggesting benefit from administration of high dose piracetam inspired the present study of the efficacy of this agent in patients with cerebellar ataxia. Piracetam is a low molecular weight derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Although little is known of its mode of action, its efficacy has been documented in a wide range of clinical indications, such as cognitive disorders, dementia, vertigo and dyslexia, as well as cortical myoclonus. The present report investigated the role of high dose piracetam in patients with cerebellar ataxia. METHODS: Eight patients with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia were given intravenous piracetam 60 g/day by a structured protocol for 14 days. The baseline and end-of-the study evaluations were based on the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale. RESULTS: Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in the patients' total score (P = 0.018) and a subscale analysis showed statistical significance for only the posture and gait disturbances item (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: This study is providing good clinical observation in favour of high dose piracetam infusion to reduce the disability of the patients by improving their gait ataxia.",

      "abstract": "It has been reported that autism is a hypoglutamatergic disorder. Therefore, it was of interest to assess the efficacy of piracetam, a positive modulator of AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors in autistic disorder. About 40 children between the ages three and 11 years (inclusive) with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism and who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to piracetam + risperidone (Group A) or placebo + risperidone (Group B) for a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 2 mg/day for children between 10 and 40 kg and 3 mg/day for children weighting above 40 kg. The dose of piracetam was titrated up to 800 mg/day. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of starting medication. The measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Rating Scale (total score). The ABC-C Rating Scale scores improved with piracetam. The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of group, the between subjects factor (F = 5.85, d.f. = 1, P = 0.02). The changes at the endpoint compared with baseline were: -11.90 +/- 3.79 (mean +/- SD) and -5.15 +/- 3.04 for group A and B respectively. A significant difference was observed on the change in scores in the ABC-C Rating Scale in week 10 compared with baseline in the two groups (t = 6.017, d.f. = 38, P < 0.0001). The results suggest that a combination of atypical antipsychotic medications and a glutamate agent such as piracetam, might have increase synergistic effects in the treatment of autism.",

In the present experiments, we study the effects of piracetam on chronic cerebral hypoperfused rats and observe its influence on amino acids, synaptic plasticity in the Perforant path-CA3 pathway and apoptosis in vivo. Cerebral hypoperfusion for 30 days by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries induced marked amnesic effects along with neuron damage, including: (1) spatial learning and memory deficits shown by longer escape latency and shorter time spent in the target quadrant; (2) significant neuronal loss and nuclei condensation in the cortex and hippocampus especially in CA1 region; (3) lower induction rate of long term potentiation, overexpression of BAX and P53 protein, and lower content of excitatory and inhibitory amino acids in hippocampus. Oral administration of piracetam (600 mg/kg, once per day for 30 days) markedly improved the memory impairment, increased the amino acid content in hippocampus, and attenuated neuronal damage. The ability of piracetam to attenuate memory deficits and neuronal damage after hypoperfusion may be beneficial in cerebrovascular type dementia.",

More than 20 years ago, an intravenous preparation of piracetam demonstrated an improvement in the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. The aim of our study was to reexamine the efficacy of piracetam in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia using an oral preparation. METHOD: The study was conducted at the Be'er Sheva Mental Health Center from May 2003 to December 2004 and involved a 9-week, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial assessing 40 DSM-IV schizophrenic and schizo-affective patients with DSM-IV-TR tardive dyskinesia. All study subjects received their usual antipsychotic treatment. Initially, subjects were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of treatment with either piracetam (4800 mg/day) or placebo. Thereafter, following a washout period of 1 week, they entered the crossover phase of the study for a further 4 weeks. The change in score of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale from baseline to the study endpoint was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: The mean decrease in score from baseline to endpoint in the clinical global impression subscale in patients treated with piracetam was 1.1 points compared to 0.1 points in the placebo group (p = .004). The mean decrease in the tardive parkinsonism subscale was 8.7 points in patients treated with piracetam and 0.6 points in those on placebo (p = .001). The mean decrease in the tardive dyskinesia subscale was 3.0 points in the piracetam group in contrast to deterioration of condition in the placebo group by -0.2 points (p = .003). CONCLUSION: Piracetam appears to be effective in reducing symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. The specific mechanism by which piracetam may attenuate symptoms of tardive dyskinesia needs to be further evaluated. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00190008.",

First, the effects of piracetam and naloxone on the amnesia induced by scopolamine, electroconvulsive shock and morphine were evaluated by using elevated plus maze apparatus. Second, the effects of electroconvulsive shock and piracetam on the antinociceptive action of morphine were tested by means of radiant heat tail-flick experiment. Piracetam and naloxone reversed the drug- or electrically-induced amnestic effects. On the other hand, electroconvulsive shock treatment enhanced the antinociceptive effect of morphine while piracetam decreased the same activity. These results suggest an important role of the opiatergic system on the learning and memory process as well as on the antiamnestic effect of piracetam."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is one of the most common genetic disorders. Sickle cell crises in which irregular and dehydrated cells contribute to blocking of blood vessels are characterised by episodes of pain. Treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic. In vitro studies with piracetam indicate that it has the potential for inhibition and a reversal of the process of sickling of erythrocytes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of piracetam for reducing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the last search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: February 2007. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing orally administered piracetam to placebo or standard care in people, of all ages and both sexes, with sickle cell disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Trial authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects data were collected from the trials. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials involving 169 participants were included in the review. A limited amount of data addressing some of the primary and some of the secondary outcomes were provided, but data were incomplete and based on unvalidated assumptions used in the evaluation of outcomes. One trial reported a reduction in the number of pain crises and their severity with active intervention than placebo but presented no data to confirm these results. A second trial presented a monthly global pain score based on the number of sickle cell crises and severity of pain but included no separate data for these primary outcomes. Although there was no significant difference between the piracetam and placebo periods for the number of days of hospitalisation (P = 0.87) in one trial, inconsistencies in the criteria necessary for hospitalisation during sickle crises did not permit accurate conclusions to be drawn. Two of the trials reported participant satisfaction with piracetam but provided no details as to how this satisfaction had been assessed. There were no reports of toxicity or adverse effects with piracetam other than one participant who experienced dizziness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The small number of included trials and their poor methodological quality provided insufficient reliable evidence to support the routine use of this medication for preventing the incidence of painful sickle cell disease crises.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be associated with postoperative cognitive impairment and ischemic stroke. No effective treatment is currently available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of piracetam to treat the cognitive impairment after CABG in an investigator-initiated, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Patients undergoing CABG (n = 98) were randomized to placebo (n = 48) or piracetam (n = 50). Study drugs were administered intravenously (150 mg/kg daily; 300 mg/kg on the day of surgery) from the day before surgery to 6 days after surgery, then orally (12 g/day) up to 6 weeks after surgery. Cognitive function was assessed before surgery (baseline) and 6 weeks after surgery (outcome) by using a battery of 12 neuropsychologic tests. The Spielberger Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory were also administered. The combined score derived from the standardized neuropsychologic assessments was analyzed by using an analysis of covariance with baseline and education as covariates. RESULTS: Six weeks after surgery, the combined score indicated a statistically significant treatment effect in the per protocol population (1.848, p = 0.041) and a tendency towards statistical significance in the intent-to-treat population (1.624, p = 0.064) in the group treated with piracetam, but no statistically significant treatment effect was seen in the placebo. The state of anxiety measured by the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory was decreased in both groups (-9.27 and -6.37 in the placebo and piracetam groups, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Six weeks after CABG, cognition was significantly improved in patients treated with piracetam. Additional trials are required to confirm these effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Piracetam has neuroprotective and antithrombotic effects which may help to reduce death and disability in people with acute stroke. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of piracetam in acute presumed ischaemic stroke. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 20 June 2005). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1980 to April 2005), and ISI Science Citation Index (1981 to April 2005). We also contacted the manufacturer of piracetam to identify further published and unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing piracetam with control, with at least mortality reported and entry to the trial within approximately 48 hours of stroke onset. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors extracted data and assessed trial quality and this was checked by the other two authors. Study authors were contacted for missing information. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials involving 1002 people were included, with one trial contributing 93% of the data. Participants' ages ranged from 40 to 85, and both sexes were equally represented. Piracetam was associated with a statistically non-significant increase in death at one month (approximately 31% increase, 95% confidence interval 81% increase to 5% reduction). This trend was no longer apparent in the large trial after correction for imbalance in stroke severity. Limited data showed no difference between the treatment and control groups for functional outcome, dependency or proportion of patients dead or dependent. Adverse effects were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some suggestion (but no statistically significant result) of an unfavourable effect of piracetam on early death, but this may have been caused by baseline differences in stroke severity in the trials. There is not enough evidence to assess the effect of piracetam on dependency.",

      "abstract": "Piracetam (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine-acetamide), the most common of the nootropic drugs, is a cyclic derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid. The treatment with piracetam improves learning, memory, brain metabolism, and capacity. Piracetam has been shown to alter the physical properties of the plasma membrane by increasing its fluidity and by protecting the cell against hypoxia. It increases red cell deformability and normalizes aggregation of hyperactive platelets. Piracetam is an agent with antithrombotic, neuroprotective and rheological properties. The interaction of this molecule with the membrane phospholipids restores membrane fluidity and could explain the efficacy of piracetam in various disorders ranging from dementia and vertigo to myoclonus and stroke.",

      "abstract": "1.--Mitochondrial dysfunction including decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced ATP production represents a common final pathway of many conditions associated with oxidative stress, for example, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and aging. 2.--Since the cognition-improving effects of the standard nootropic piracetam are usually more pronounced under such pathological conditions and young healthy animals usually benefit little by piracetam, the effect of piracetam on mitochondrial dysfunction following oxidative stress was investigated using PC12 cells and dissociated brain cells of animals treated with piracetam. 3.--Piracetam treatment at concentrations between 100 and 1000 microM improved mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production of PC12 cells following oxidative stress induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and serum deprivation. Under conditions of mild serum deprivation, piracetam (500 microM) induced a nearly complete recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels. Piracetam also reduced caspase 9 activity after SNP treatment. 4.--Piracetam treatment (100-500 mg kg(-1) daily) of mice was also associated with improved mitochondrial function in dissociated brain cells. Significant improvement was mainly seen in aged animals and only less in young animals. Moreover, the same treatment reduced antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) in aged mouse brain only, which are elevated as an adaptive response to the increased oxidative stress with aging. 5.--In conclusion, therapeutically relevant in vitro and in vivo concentrations of piracetam are able to improve mitochondrial dysfunction associated with oxidative stress and/or aging. Mitochondrial stabilization and protection might be an important mechanism to explain many of piracetam's beneficial effects in elderly patients.",
