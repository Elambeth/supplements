      "abstract": "Lymphoma is a malignancy of the immune system, which originates from lymphatic tissues and lymph nodes. Diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common type of non‑Hodgkin lymphoma, occurring in 30‑40% of all cases, which has persistent clinical challenges. The treatment of DLBCL is challenging due to its diverse genetic and biological characteristics and complex clinical physiology. Despite advancements in overall prognosis, 20‑25% of patients continue to experience relapse and 10‑15% of patients experience refractory disease. Vitamin C is a water‑soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties and notable pharmacological activity, with potential applications in cancer therapy. Pharmacological doses of vitamin C (1‑4 g/kg) can induce apoptosis in malignant cells by inhibiting and/or reversing gene mutations that are associated with hematological malignancies. For example, 10‑25% of patients with myeloid malignancies have tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) gene mutations and vitamin C can regulate blood stem cell frequency and leukemia production by enhancing TET2 function. Consequently, pharmacological doses of vitamin C can inhibit the development and progression of hematological malignancies. Therefore, the present review aimed to investigate the role of vitamin C in the pathophysiology and treatment of DLBCL, whilst highlighting the potential challenges and future perspectives."

      "abstract": "Background Despite improvements in medical treatment, sepsis remains a deadly illness with high fatality rates that is characterized by excessive inflammation and oxidative stress. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin C supplementation on inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and clinical outcomes in sepsis patients. Methodology A prospective observational study was conducted over one year at Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, including 326 adult sepsis cases meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria. To maximize early therapeutic benefits, intravenous vitamin C supplementation (1,500 mg/day) was administered for 14 days, followed by a maintenance regimen of 1,500 mg/day for 14 days every 3-6 months to sustain therapeutic effects. The efficacy of vitamin C was assessed through serial measurements of oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde) and inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α) at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Clinical outcomes, including ICU stay, organ dysfunction, and mortality, were prospectively recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results Vitamin C supplementation in sepsis patients led to significant improvements over 12 months, with reductions in IL-6 (345.16 ± 128.52 to 245.12 ± 83.78 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (CRP) (175.31 ± 62.43 to 114.57 ± 38.67 mg/L), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (8.94 ± 3.21 to 5.79 ± 2.18 nmol/mL). Clinical outcomes also improved, including a decrease in the 30-day mortality rate from 14.11% (n=46) to 6.90% (n=22), organ dysfunction score from 9.82 ± 4.03 to 4.83 ± 2.54, and ICU stay from 11.57 ± 3.85 to 7.24 ± 3.01 days. Regression analysis indicated that vitamin C supplementation was significantly associated with better outcomes (β = -2.34, p = 0.012), while chronic kidney disease was associated with worse outcomes (β = 1.75, p < 0.001). Conclusion Supplementing with vitamin C has been shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes in sepsis by lowering oxidative stress and inflammation."

      "abstract": "Background: Oxidative stress and systemic inflammation during cardiac surgery can lead to postoperative complications. Although vitamin C and thiamine (vitamin B1) have individually demonstrated protective effects, their combined effects remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combined vitamin C and B1 therapy versus that of vitamin C alone in reducing inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers and improving postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: In this prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 64 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery at a tertiary care center were randomized to receive either 1000 mg vitamin C or a combination of 1000 mg vitamin C and 100 mg vitamin B1 at four perioperative time points. Primary outcomes included changes in inflammatory biomarkers [C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and white blood cells], and cardiac biomarkers [creatine kinase-MB, Troponin-I, and lactate dehydrogenase]. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic parameters and left ventricular function. Results: Compared with vitamin C alone, combined vitamin B1 and vitamin C significantly reduced postoperative cardiac biomarker levels. IL-6 levels were significantly lower immediately in the combined group; however, this effect was not sustained at 24 h post-surgery. Up to 24 h after surgery, no significant differences in hemodynamic stability or left ventricular ejection were observed between the groups. Notably, the combined therapy group demonstrated a lower incidence of postoperative arrhythmias and shorter dobutamine duration within 24 postoperatively. Conclusions: Combined vitamin C and B1 therapy significantly reduced markers of myocardial injury and early inflammatory responses (IL-6) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, suggesting its potential as a protective agent.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis and septic shock are associated with high mortality and morbidity despite adequate standard care. Vitamin C deficiency is a common, potentially reversible, contributor to morbidity and mortality in sepsis. Previous studies have shown mixed and conflicting results. Our study aimed to determine the potential benefit of early administration (within 6 h after admission) of vitamin C in patients with sepsis or septic shock. METHODS: This was a phase 3b prospective, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Participants were enrolled in the Emergency Departments of 8 hospitals throughout Belgium. Patients were randomized to receive 1.5 g of vitamin C, or matching placebo, every 6 h for 4 days. The primary outcome was the average post-baseline patient Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on day 2 to 5. Key secondary outcomes were the maximum SOFA score, 28-day mortality and length of ICU and hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 300 patients were recruited between June 4th, 2021, and August 19th, 2023. 292 patients, of which 147 were assigned to the vitamin C and 145 to the placebo group, completed the trial and were included in the analysis. The primary outcome (vitamin C, 1.98; placebo, 2.19) was 8.7% lower in the vitamin C group, but not significantly (ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.08, P = 0.30). In a planned subgroup analysis, patients with a baseline SOFA score of 6 or above had a significant lower average post-baseline SOFA score in the vitamin C group (ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99, P = 0.042). Findings were similar in the two groups regarding secondary outcomes and adverse events, except for a lower probability of being on renal replacement therapy in the vitamin C group of the per protocol analysis (ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.078 to 1.0, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with vitamin C did not result in a statistically significant reduction in organ dysfunction. Therefore, this study does not support the use of vitamin C in sepsis patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04747795 . Registered 4 February 2021.",

      "abstract": "Keratinocyte differentiation is highly regulated to produce the stratified structure of the epidermis and must be balanced with cell proliferation. Our prior studies revealed that hairless mice that cannot synthesize vitamin C (VC) exhibit epidermal atrophy. VC is a cofactor for the DNA demethylation (TET) enzyme, but the role of VC in DNA demethylation during keratinocyte differentiation remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the role of VC in epigenetic regulation of epidermal proliferation and differentiation in a human epidermal equivalent model. Our findings demonstrated that intracellular VC uptake increased epidermal thickness, cell proliferation, and global levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) DNA. Notably, these effects of VC were attenuated by an inhibitor of the TET enzyme. DNA microarray and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analyses revealed that twelve genes related to cell proliferation were significantly upregulated by VC. Further, hypomethylated DNA regions associated with these genes were revealed in the presence of VC. Collectively, our findings provide insight into how VC increases epidermal thickness by promoting keratinocyte proliferation via the DNA demethylation of proliferation-related genes. VC is a promising molecule that can be used as developing treatment for epidermal thinning, including in aging."

      "abstract": "Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a recently approved cancer therapy utilizing an antibody conjugated to IR700 dye which is injected and then followed with focal NIR light. NIR-PIT is ideal for focal therapy of cancer because of its cell specificity and minimal invasiveness compared to surgical resection. Most treatment-emergent adverse events are low grade and include edema, fatigue, and pain. However, edema in specific anatomic locations could lead to significant complications, such as airway obstruction, and thus, it is desirable to reduce edema if possible. Edema and the resulting pain are likely precipitated by reactive oxygen species generated primarily from the interaction of laser light with unbound antibody-photoabsorber conjugate. These reactive species can be neutralized by reducing agents, such as vitamin C, a potent reducing agent and proton donor. Based on its photochemical mechanisms, we hypothesized that pretreating patients with L-sodium ascorbate (L-NaAA) will reduce NIR-PIT-induced edema. Here, we evaluated the effect of L-NaAA concentration on edema as well as its effect on the immune responses after NIR-PIT. L-NaAA demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of edema after NIR-PIT without compromising the efficacy of NIR-PIT. Furthermore, L-NaAA did not impede the anticancer immune activation elicited by NIR-PIT, nor did it affect the efficacy of Treg-targeted NIR-PIT. NIR-PIT groups, both with and without L-NaAA, significantly inhibited tumor growth and resulted in markedly prolonged survival compared to the control group, but those with L-NaAA had reduced edema. Thus, L-NaAA may serve as a useful adjunct to NIR-PIT, enhancing its safety profile without detracting from its therapeutic efficacy."

      "abstract": "Bleomycin, an antibacterial antibiotic, is used in chemotherapy and is effective against various forms of human carcinomas. However, its use is limited due to its tendency to cause pulmonary fibrosis. Oxidative stress and excessive expression of TGF beta occur in pulmonary fibrosis, leading to cellular death, inflammation, and additional damage to lung tissue. Metformin has the ability to reduce oxidative stress and lower the level of TGF beta by activating AMPK. Additionally, ascorbic acid possesses potent antioxidant characteristics. Consequently, we decided to investigate the effects of these two medications on pulmonary fibrosis and compare with methyl prednisolone. Thirty-six adult mice were categorized into 6 distinct groups: Control, bleomycin (bleo), bleo + methyl prednisolone, bleo + metformin, bleo + ascorbic acid, bleo + metformin + ascorbic acid. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by the administration of bleomycin in all groups, except for the control group. Subsequently, medications were administered for a duration of 14 days. Ultimately, the mice were sacrificed and lung tissues were obtained for biochemical and histological examination. As shown by biochemical and histological analysis, all treatment groups showed a decrease in oxidative stress factors, inflammation, and lung tissue fibrosis; however, the effects of administering metformin and ascorbic acid together were noticeable. Our study found that administering metformin and ascorbic acid over a period of 14 days, either alone or in combination, may contribute to the repair of pulmonary fibrosis. However, our data indicate that the combined therapy of these drugs provided a better result."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to global health, exacerbated by the protective mechanisms of biofilms formed by drug-resistant bacteria. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bacteria in biofilms serve as a formidable shield, impeding the efficacy of antimicrobial agents. Here, we investigated the potential of vitamin C (sodium ascorbate) to disrupt biofilm formation in drug-resistant bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients and studied the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of vitamin C on these bacteria. RESULTS: Out of 117 study isolates, primarily identified as Escherichia coli (n = 52), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 19), and Klebsiella spp. (n = 46), 80 isolates exhibited a Multiple Antimicrobial Resistance (MAR) index greater than 0.2, classifying them as multi-drug resistant (MDR) superbugs. Among these, 58 isolates demonstrated moderate to strong biofilm-forming abilities and were selected for further experiments with vitamin C. The effective concentration of vitamin C inhibiting the growth of most E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates (90%) was estimated at 1.25 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml respectively, while for allStaphylococcus spp. isolates, it was 0.325 mg/ml. Vitamin C exhibited a notable anti-biofilm effect against the studied isolates, with biofilm prevention concentrations (BPC) of 0.625, 1.25, and 0.16 mg/ml for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Staphylococcus spp. isolates respectively. Furthermore, when combined with oxacillin or amoxicillin - drugs that were found ineffective, vitamin C significantly reduced the ability of MDR isolates to form biofilms, rendering them susceptible to the drugs' effects and restoring their efficacy. The expression of the recA gene, an early and quantifiable marker for the onset of the SOS response and biofilm production was downregulated after treatment of E. coli with vitamin C. Relative gene expression analysis revealed that ciprofloxacin-induced recA expression was significantly inhibited when MDR isolates of E. coli were treated with vitamin C at a concentration of 0.625 mg/ml, the BPC of vitamin C. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that vitamin C, alone or in combination with ineffective antibiotics, attenuates biofilm formation and restores the susceptibility of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates to antimicrobial agents. This study underscores the promise of vitamin C as a non-lethal disruptor of biofilm-associated antimicrobial resistance. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the ability of vitamin C to reduce symptom severity and length of hospital stay among children with CAP as well as determine its optimal dose. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted between July 2020 and October 2023. The participating patients were aged 6 months to 15 years, had CAP, and required hospitalization at Naresuan University Hospital. The patients were randomly assigned to placebo, low-dose vitamin C (15 mg/kg/dose every 6 h), and high-dose vitamin C (30 mg/kg/dose every 6 h) groups. Treatment was provided until discharge and doses maximized after 3 days. The patients' clinical symptoms and side effects were recorded every 12 h. RESULTS: This study included 143 patients (median age, 3 years). The clinical severity score improved significantly in the low- and high-dose vitamin C versus placebo groups at 48-72 h. Vitamin C supplementation did not reduce the length of hospital stay in any group. CONCLUSION: Vitamin C supplementation did not reduce the length of hospital stay among patients with CAP who required hospitalization.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin C shows strong anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, so we explored whether it can replace glucocorticoids in reducing pain and inflammation after total hip arthroplasty (THA). METHODS: In this prospective trial, a consecutive series of 107 patients (43.0% men, 56.8 ± 10.1 years of age, 100% Han Chinese) who underwent THA due to end-stage hip disease at our medical center between January 2023 and January 2024 were randomized to receive vitamin C, dexamethasone, or neither dexamethasone nor vitamin C after surgery. The 3 groups were compared in terms of the primary outcomes of pain reported on a visual analogue scale (VAS), perioperative morphine use, and blood indices of inflammation and fibrinolysis as well as in terms of secondary outcomes of efficacy and safety. RESULTS: Compared with patients in the control group, those who received vitamin C or dexamethasone reported a significantly lower VAS pain score on postoperative day 1, had significantly lower perioperative morphine consumption, and demonstrated significantly lower blood levels of C-reactive protein on days 1 and 2. The 2 groups also showed a significantly lower rate of rescue analgesia on postoperative day 1 and significantly higher Harris hip scores of joint function at 2 and 12 weeks after surgery, as well as significantly smaller thigh circumference and a lower rate of swelling on the first 2 days after surgery. Either treatment was associated with a significantly lower rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Dexamethasone was associated with greater blood glucose levels after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C may be an effective substitute for glucocorticoids for reducing morphine use and the risk of nausea or vomiting and for improving joint function after THA without side effects causing blood glucose fluctuations.

      "abstract": "Despite extensive evidence demonstrating that vitamin C suppresses the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, research exploring its impact on cytokine release from peripheral blood cells upon bacterial antigen stimulation remains limited. This research investigated the influence of vitamin C on LPS-triggered secretion of cellular inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood. Ten healthy volunteers provided heparinized whole blood, diluted with RPMI-1640 and distributed into containers. Cytokines (IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-4, TNF-α, IL-2 and IL-6) were quantified using flow cytometric cytokine detection kits. Results showed that LPS significantly increased IL-10 (baseline 2.7±1.35 pg/mL to 34.1±14.86 pg/mL), TNF-α (1.5±0.71 pg/mL to 1136.4±476.56 pg/mL) and IL-6 (1.8±0.59 pg/mL to 2033.4±755.29 pg/mL) levels, while IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-2 remained unaffected. Vitamin C treatment significantly inhibited the secretion of IL-10 (23.5±5.5 pg/mL, P=0.0019), TNF-α (407.3±96.44 pg/mL, P=0.0389) and IL-6 (1572.4±444.43 pg/mL, P=0.0275). Both LPS and vitamin C caused a mild reduction in red blood cell counts, but no hemolysis was observed. These findings highlight vitamin C's potential to inhibit LPS-induced inflammation in peripheral blood, providing a basis for its therapeutic application in bacterial infection-related inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ciprofloxacin (CPFX), a second-generation fluoroquinolone, is widely used as an anti-infective agent for genitourinary tract infections due to its broad-spectrum efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Although CPFX is considered safe at therapeutic doses, recent evidence suggests its potential biological toxicity, particularly affecting testicular histology and function. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CPFX on testicular structure and function and to evaluate the protective role of vitamin C. METHODS: Forty adult male albino rats were divided into four groups: control, CPFX-treated, vitamin C-treated, and CPFX combined with vitamin C-treated. After 60 days of treatment, blood samples were collected for hormonal assays, while testicular and epididymal tissues were analyzed using light and electron microscopy. Oxidative stress markers, including malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT) enzyme activity, were assessed. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software. RESULTS: Confocal microscopy of the CPFX-treated group revealed significant reductions in germ cell populations within seminiferous tubules, accompanied by severe apoptosis and degenerative epithelial changes. Morphometric analysis confirmed a decrease in tubular diameter and epithelial height, degeneration of spermatogenic cells, and detachment of apoptotic cells from the basement membrane. CPFX treatment significantly reduced testosterone levels and induced variable changes in gonadotropin hormones (LH and FSH). Co-administration of vitamin C with CPFX restored normal testicular morphology, preserving seminiferous tubule integrity and maintaining spermatogenic cell populations and spermatozoa within the lumen. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Vitamin C supplementation effectively mitigated CPFX-induced oxidative stress by significantly reducing MDA levels and enhancing antioxidant defenses, including increased GSH content and CAT enzyme activity. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of vitamin C in reversing CPFX-induced testicular toxicity by alleviating oxidative stress and restoring testicular function."

      "abstract": "The intricate relationship between nutrition, gut microbiome, and mental health has gained increasing attention. We aimed to determine how vitamin C supplementation improves mental vitality through the gut microbiome and associated neurological and immunological changes. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze gut microbiota profiles of participants from our previous trial, in which healthy young adults (20-39 years) with inadequate serum vitamin C levels (< 50 μM) received 500 mg vitamin C or a placebo twice daily for 4 weeks (vitamin C, n = 21; placebo, n = 19). We examined whether changes in gut microbiota correlated with previously determined mental vitality indices, including Stroop test performance, work engagement, and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Serum concentrations of microbial-derived molecules, cytokines, and neurotransmitters were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay, or ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Monocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood were quantified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Vitamin C supplementation increased the relative abundance of Bacillaceae and Anaerotruncus, while decreasing Desulfovibrio, with the Desulfovibrio reduction correlating with Stroop test performance. Moreover, participants showing a substantial Desulfovibrio reduction (\"responders\") demonstrated greater BDNF increases and stronger correlations between serum L-DOPA levels and work engagement scores than did non-responders. In addition, vitamin C supplementation suppressed inflammatory responses with concurrent reduction in serum lipopolysaccharide levels, and responders showed greater decreases in IL-10 levels and classical monocyte frequencies than non-responders. In conclusion, vitamin C supplementation modulates gut microbiota composition, particularly by reducing Desulfovibrio abundance, with the extent of reduction correlating with mental vitality improvements and decreased inflammation. This study provides insights into vitamin C supplementation as a critical dietary intervention, as it may modulate mental health through its influence on the gut-brain-immune axis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension poses an imperative global health risk, affecting over 1 billion people and contributing to cardiovascular disease, especially for women. While previous studies suggest micronutrients such as Vitamin C or Selenium can help reduce blood pressure, research on their interactive effects remains limited. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 9,343 women aged 20 years and older in NHANES (2011-2020). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of each micronutrient on hypertension. To account for potential interactions between micronutrients, we calculated the relative excess risk due to interaction, which assessed their combined effect on hypertension. RESULTS: We confirmed the individual associations of Vitamin C and Selenium with hypertension, showing significant negative correlations (p < 0.05). Participants were then divided into four groups, and those with high intakes of both Vitamin C and Selenium had a significantly lower risk of hypertension (p < 0.05), supporting the association between the combined intake of these nutrients and lower hypertension risk, though no synergistic effect was observed. CONCLUSION: The findings support the combined intake of Vitamin C and Selenium in hypertension prevention, broadening thoughts on the level of nutrition for the treatment of hypertension. These results suggest a potential association between adequate supplementation of Vitamin C and Selenium and lower blood pressure. However, further rigorous clinical studies are essential to validate and strengthen these findings."

      "abstract": "Introduction As the focus on dental aesthetics intensifies, contemporary cosmetic dentistry seeks to establish an equilibrium between teeth and gums. Gingival hyperpigmentation, resulting from excessive melanin accumulation, can impact individuals regardless of age or gender and frequently gives rise to aesthetic apprehensions. Microneedling combined with topical vitamin C is a promising new method for improving gum appearance, particularly for reducing gingival hyperpigmentation caused by excess melanin. Microneedling is less expensive, more versatile, and promotes faster healing than traditional procedures like lasers or surgery. Materials and methods A study with 10 participants at the Karnavati School of Dentistry demonstrated significant pigmentation reduction. A paste was made with powdered ascorbic acid and a liquid ampule solution and applied with a Derma Pen (Dr. Pen Ultima A1, C Cube Advanced Technologies, India), which is a rechargeable pen-like instrument with 24-36 adjustable needles (0.25 mm to 2 mm) and five-speed settings. The gadget enables multi-directional treatment, and its disposable needle tips assure clean use with several patients. Results A significant decrease in melanin pigmentation was observed across all age groups, but anatomical challenges, such as irregular gingival contours, hampered results in some cases. Conclusion Microneedling is a safe and effective option for improving gingival aesthetics. As the technique evolves, it has the potential for broader applications."

This study explores the protective effect of vitamin C on the thermal degradation of myricetin and its mechanism of action. O-phenylenediamine derivatization identified reactive ortho-quinone intermediates, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations (ΔG = -47.74 kcal/mol) confirmed the redox mechanism. Vitamin C significantly improved myricetin retention from 32.8 % to 91.4 % in 0.8 mM after 100 min of heating, outperforming nitrogen treatment. Myricetin degradation begins with oxidation to ortho-quinones, which further degrades into phenolic acids and aldehydes. Vitamin C not only inhibited this process but also reversed oxidation by reducing ortho-quinones back to myricetin.

      "abstract": "Vitamin C is a versatile nutrient with essential antioxidant properties and roles in amino acid metabolism, collagen promotion, and hormone synthesis. It has long been regarded as benefitting infectious disease management, although its specific roles remain uncertain. The dominant view is that this efficacy not only stems from its redox regulation in the body but also from its profound impact on the immune system. This review provides a comprehensive overview of Vitamin C's effects on redox regulation and shows how the vitamin influences various immune cells and cell-intrinsic innate immunity signaling pathways, thereby updating and expanding our previous perspectives. Clinically, though some studies and case series have suggested potential benefits of Vitamin C in preventing and (or) treating respiratory tract infections and sepsis and septic shock, the evidence remains controversial. The current data is insufficient to support the routine clinical use of Vitamin C in managing these diseases and requires further rigorous evaluation to establish definitive efficacy and safety profiles. This review thoroughly examines current clinical research progress on Vitamin C, summarizes the primary controversies and their underlying causes, and proposes directions for future clinical research. Furthermore, preclinical evidence shows potential roles for Vitamin C in the supplementary treatment of the \"Big Three\" infectious diseases: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis, and malaria; however, systematic clinical studies in these areas are lacking. We examine related in vitro and animal studies, as well as clinical trials, and discuss potential roles for Vitamin C as a treatment and (or) adjuvant therapy.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: In 2022, approximately 2.3 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, resulting in 670,000 deaths, which accounted for 6.9% of all cancer-related deaths. In the United States, 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. It was estimated that 2024 would identify about 310,720 women and 2800 men diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. The future global burden of breast cancer is projected to rise to over 3 million new cases and 1 million deaths by 2040. Approximately 20% of breast cancer diagnoses are triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a type of cancer that lacks receptors for estrogen (ER-negative), progesterone (PR-negative), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu-negative). Consequently, TNBC does not respond to hormonal or targeted therapies, making it challenging to treat due to its rapid growth, metastasis, and high recurrence rate within the first three years of therapy. Alternative chemotherapies are needed to address this problem. A pharmacological dose of vitamin C (high-dose VC) has been identified as a potential treatment for some cancer cells. The present study aimed to evaluate whether VC has a therapeutic effect on TNBC, using MDA-MB-231 cells as the model. Additionally, VC's effects were trialed on other cancer cells such as MCF7 and on non-cancerous kidney HEK 293 and lung CCL205 cells. Methods: The MTT assay, Hoechst 33342 staining, nuclear-ID red/green staining, Rhodamine 123 staining, and Western blot analysis were employed to test the hypothesis that a pharmacological dose of VC can kill TNBC cells. Results: The upregulation of Apaf-1 and caspases -7, -8, and -9, the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), a reduction in cell cycle protein expression, and the enhancement of tumor suppressor proteins such as p53 and p21 indicate that a pharmacological dose of VC has promising anti-cancer properties in the treatment of breast cancers. Conclusions: Pharmacological dose of VC exerts significant anti-cancer effects in MDA-MB-231 cells by promoting apoptosis, inhibiting metastasis, disrupting cell cycle progression, and enhancing tumor suppressor activity."

In colorectal cancer (CRC), although anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies demonstrate promise, their efficacy is still constrained. Our prior research demonstrated that VitC can inhibit tumor growth by suppressing the Warburg effect. This study aims to explore the effects of high-dose VitC on PD-L1 expression in CRC, focusing on its underlying mechanisms and potential for enhancing immunotherapy. We found that VitC inhibits aerobic glycolysis in HCT116 cells while also downregulating PD-L1 expression. Further investigations indicated that this process is mediated by VitC's activation of AMPK, which downregulates HK2 and NF-κB, ultimately resulting in reduced PD-L1 expression and increased T cell infiltration. Notably, we observed that VitC and the PD-L1 monoclonal antibody atezolizumab exhibit comparable tumor-inhibiting abilities, and their combined use further enhances this efficacy. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that high-dose VitC activates AMPK, downregulates PD-L1 expression, mitigates immune evasion, and suppresses tumor growth. This provides a promising strategy for optimizing immunotherapy in CRC."

However, its efficacy is hindered by insufficient immune response, elevated antioxidant levels within tumor, and intrinsic tumor resistance mechanisms. This study introduces Vitamin C (VC), a widely available dietary nutrient, as an effective enhancer for PTI. High-dose VC induces oxidative imbalance in tumor cells, making them more susceptible to nanoenabled near-infrared-II photothermal therapy (NIR-II PTT) with the photosensitizer IR1080. The combination of VC and NIR-II PTT significantly amplifies antitumor immunity by upregulating CXCL16 expression and promoting CXCR6+ T cell infiltration. Clinical data reveal that higher CXCL16 and CXCR6 levels in human tumors correlate with improved survival and T cell infiltration, underscoring the translational potential of this approach. This study positions VC as a safe, accessible, and cost-effective dietary enhancer for PTI, reshaping the role of dietary nutrients in cancer therapy and offering a strategy for overcoming treatment resistance.",

After a 60-day feeding trial, comprehensive analyses revealed significant improvements in growth performance, digestive enzyme activities, immune responses, and antioxidant status across supplemented groups, with bee venom exhibiting the most pronounced effects. Nutraceutical supplementation enhanced gastrointestinal enzyme activities, modulated gut microbiota composition, and improved liver and intestinal histological characteristics. Immunological assessments demonstrated elevated lysozyme levels, bactericidal activity, and respiratory burst activity, while antioxidant markers showed increased superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities, accompanied by reduced malondialdehyde levels.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) therapy was widely touted as a potential treatment or preventive therapy for COVID-19 despite a lack of supporting evidence. One potential harm of high-dose vitamin C supplementation is increased urinary oxalate, which may increase the risk of hyperoxaluria and oxalate kidney stones. This study aims to evaluate public interest in vitamin C during the COVID-19 pandemic based on online search volume and to characterize variation in vitamin C interest as a potential contributor to kidney stone formation.  Methods: The volume and frequency of online search traffic related to vitamin C and COVID-19 were assessed using the Google Trends platform (Google LLC, Mountain View, CA, USA) between 2018 and 2022. Weekly relative search volumes (RSV), the proportional volume of online searches for a search term, were assessed to compare variations in online interest in vitamin C and COVID-19. The most popular Google search results for vitamin C as a treatment for COVID-19 were assessed for medical accuracy. Statistical analysis was performed with t-tests and linear regression. RESULTS: Online search volume for vitamin C increased four-fold at the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020. After the initial outbreak, average RSV for vitamin C remained significantly elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 levels (37.7 vs. 25.1, p<0.001). Weekly RSV for vitamin C increased steadily during the study period (R2=0.59, p<0.001). The peak in online interest in vitamin C corresponded to increased online search volume during three global COVID-19 surges. Among the most popular results for COVID-19-related vitamin C queries, 30% inaccurately suggested that vitamin C had potential benefits in treating COVID-19. None of these search results discussed the potential increased risk of kidney stones with vitamin C supplementation. CONCLUSION: Online public interest in vitamin C supplementation increased and remained elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have implications for increased risk of hyperoxaluria and oxalate stones due to vitamin C supplementation. Kidney stone patients should be counseled that excess vitamin C intake is associated with increased urinary oxalate and incident stone formation."

Postoperative metamizole consumption was notably higher in the control group compared to the vitamin C group (p=0.006). Postoperative VAS score was higher in the control group (p< 0.05). No significant differences in HHS values were detected between the groups at 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively (p=0.655 and p=0.755, respectively). The group variable significantly contributed to VAS score, and age and gender variables significantly contributed to HHS value. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction of subjective pain levels and lower analgesic consumption was found in patients who received vitamin C, suggesting that it should be considered as an adjuvant agent for analgesia in patients with hip fracture."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Micronutrient deficiency is commonly observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet the role of certain dietary trace elements in the risk of IBD development remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between vitamin C, D, and K intake and IBD risk. METHODS: This study included 3,591 participants from the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multivariable logistic regression were conducted to assess associations between vitamin C, D, and K intake and IBD risk while controlling for multiple confounders. Subgroup analyses were employed to test the robustness of the associations across participants with various characteristics. Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted to investigate potential nonlinear relationships. RESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, each 1 mcg increase in vitamin D intake was linked to an approximately 51% decrease in IBD risk (adjusted OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25-0.98, p = 0.045). The benefit appeared stronger in women, individuals without hypertension, and non-smokers. No statistically significant associations were found between vitamin C or vitamin K intake and IBD risk. However, among individuals without diabetes, each 1 mcg increase in vitamin K intake was associated with an approximate 67% reduction in IBD risk (adjusted OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.12-0.94, p = 0.039). RCS analysis suggested a linear relationship between dietary micronutrient intake and IBD risk (vitamin D: p for nonlinearity = 0.127, p for overall = 0.015; vitamin C: p for nonlinearity = 0.984, p for overall = 0.937; vitamin K: p for nonlinearity = 0.736, p for overall = 0.434). CONCLUSION: Increased vitamin D intake may reduce the risk of IBD, with more pronounced benefits in certain subgroups, highlighting the potential of vitamin D supplementation as a novel therapeutic approach for IBD prevention and management. Future well-designed studies should further test the therapeutic effects of vitamin D supplementation and investigate the associations of other dietary trace elements with IBD risk to better inform prevention and treatment approaches.",

METHODS: The PTC/EBV-associated genes were obtained by intersection and further screen out hub genes to construct a prognostic model. The relationship between PTC/EBV-related genes and core genes and immune infiltration was analyzed, respectively. Finally, the core targets of vitamin C against PTC/EBV were screened, and the binding sites were determined by molecular docking with vitamin C. RESULTS: The diagnostic efficiency and prognostic value of this model was good. The prognostic model performed well in male, female, classical, T3-4, N0, and N1 subgroups. Core genes STAT1 and APOE were highly expressed and FGF7 was lowly expressed in PTC. The core genes STAT1, APOE and FGF7 were significantly correlated with a variety of immune cells. 263 vitamin C-related targets were screened by the database, and 11 cross genes between vitamin C and PTC/EBV were identified. 4 molecular targets with the best performance, LGALS3, MMP9, CTSB and CTSS, were identified by topological analysis, and the binding energies were all <  -5.0 kcal/mol. CONCLUSIONS: Our prognostic model has good diagnostic and prognostic effects and has potential value of basic research. This study for the first time revealed the related molecular functions of vitamin C and the molecular targets for the treatment of PTC/EBV."

      "abstract": "In the context of pollution-free waste treatment, anaerobic fermentation liquid (AFL), a prominent by-product of biogas engineering, has emerged as a focal point in contemporary research. Concurrently, vitamin C, an active compound abundant in fruits and vegetables, possesses extensive application potential. The development of efficient extraction processes and the utilization of its biological activities have garnered significant attention from researchers. This study investigated the impact of AFL on the growth and vitamin C content of Bok choy through field trials of varying concentrations of AFL. The results indicated that the growth characteristics of Bok choy exhibited a concentration-dependent trend with increasing AFL dosage, with the highest yield observed in the AFL-2 group (8.43 kg/m2). Additionally, with the increase in the concentration of the AFL application, the vitamin C content in Bok choy exhibited a trend of initially increasing and then decreasing, reaching its highest value (70.83 mg/100 g) in the AFL-1 group. Furthermore, response surface methodology was employed to optimize the microwave-assisted organic solvent extraction process of vitamin C, revealing that the optimal conditions for microwave-assisted extraction using a 2% citric acid solution were as follows: a microwave power of 313 W, a microwave time of 1.3 min, and a liquid-to-solid ratio of 16.4:1 v/w, achieving a vitamin C extraction rate of 90.77%. Subsequent mechanistic studies on colitis repair demonstrated that the combination of vitamin C and allicin significantly enhanced the ability of intestinal microorganisms to ferment and degrade complex carbohydrates in colitis-afflicted mice, thereby alleviating intestinal inflammation, markedly reducing bacterial invasion signals on intestinal epithelial cells, and decreasing the risk of intestinal infection. This study provides a valuable perspective for the harmless utilization of agricultural waste, and provides a theoretical basis and technical support for the high-value utilization of natural active ingredients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The nutritional status of communities susceptible to Buruli ulcer (BU, a skin NTD caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans) remains almost completely obscure. We have assessed the diets of BU patients vs. controls from the same BU-endemic communities, and compared their circulating biomarkers of nutrients and inflammation. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated two cohorts of BU patients and controls. The first were administered food frequency and multi-pass 24-hour recall questionnaires to determine patterns of foods consumed, nutrient intake and nutrient adequacy. The second used archived serum samples collected as baseline to measure the circulating concentration of zinc, vitamin C, CRP, IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6. Stunted growth was more prevalent than expected (31%), while 18% of participants were underweight and most had inadequate intake of all micronutrients except for carbohydrate. BU patients had a lower intake of, selenium, vitamin B12 and zinc, and for selenium and vitamin B12 a higher proportion had dietary insufficiency (40% vs. 15% and 80% vs. 55%, respectively). In line with this, BU patients had significantly lower levels of zinc in their serum, and more had levels below the normal range (72% vs. 43%). Despite many participants having a good intake of vitamin C, serum levels were low, and lower amongst the BU patients. As expected, there was little evidence of systemic inflammation (CRP <0.6 mg/L). Elevated IL-6 levels were present in several participants suggesting that environmental enteric dysfunction may be prevalent in these communities, however this was similar in cases vs. controls. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Diet and nutritional status may be a contributing factor to BU pathogenesis. Protein and the micronutrients zinc, selenium, vitamin B12 and vitamin C may be of particular importance. Nutritional interventions may have potential for both prophylaxis and treatment of BU, which may be a cost-effective approach to achieving the NTD Roadmap goals.",

Among the air pollutants, UV radiation and particulate matter (PM) have been found among the most aggressive in terms of skin damage, inducing oxinflammatory responses, promoting degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and compromising the cutaneous defensive barrier. Topical application of technologies able to prevent oxidative damage is still one of the best approaches to protect our skin, and considering the well-known antioxidant network, application of an antioxidant mixture is more recommended than a single compound. In the present study, human skin explants were exposed every day for 4 days to diesel particles (DEE) or to UV after the daily pre-treatment with a topical application of a commercially available antioxidant mixture (AOX Mix), containing 15% ascorbic acid, 0.5% ferulic acid and 1% tocopherol. Oxidative stress markers such as 4-hydroxynonenal, skin barrier proteins such as involucrin, filaggrin, claudin-1 and desmocollin-1, resilience markers such as elastin and tropoelastin, and the levels of Type I and Type III collagens were assessed. Topical application was able to prevent most of the damage induced by the outdoor stressors, confirming that daily protection is needed to prevent cutaneous premature ageing.",

This study aimed to evaluate the potential histopathological and biochemical changes in the skin and brain of adult albino rats treated with ivermectin, as well as the effectiveness of Vitamin C and flumazenil in their treatment. Thirty rats were divided into five treatment groups, each containing six rats. After a week of acclimatization, different doses of ivermectin, Vitamin C, and flumazenil were administered to the rats. The rats were then euthanized. Histological and micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) analysis of the skin and brain tissues, immunohistochemistry, and plasma collection from tail vein puncture were conducted to measure dopamine and interleukin 5 levels. The control group showed minimal acute toxicity, with an increase in hsa-miR535a-5p, dopamine, interleukin 5 (IL-5), and p-glycoprotein levels. In conclusion, the acute toxic effects of ivermectin in rats led to significant histological and morphological changes in both brain and skin tissues, along with oxidative stress and disruptions in P-glycoprotein, inflammatory cytokines, and the inflammatory response.

Retinoids (or retinol derivatives) can intervene in this process, which can be optimally formulated and concentrated by providing maximum antiaging effects with minimal irritation. AIMS: To determine the optimal ratio of two retinol derivatives hydroxypinacolone retinoate (HPR), retinol propionate (RP), and vitamin C (VitC) in dermal remodeling and preventing skin aging, and to investigate their synergistic antiaging and whitening effects in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: An in vitro model of human skin fibroblast (HSF) was established to evaluate the cellular viability of VitC and/or RP/HPR treatment. We quantified the expression of genes associated with antiaging and retinol receptors in HSFs treated with VitC and/or RP/HPR. The research was conducted on 120 volunteer women to quantify the antiaging efficacy of functional skincare formulation. RESULTS: A combination of VitC and RP/HPR at a weight ratio of 40:3 achieved the optimal and safe antiaging performance in vitro. Transcription of aging-associated genes and the release of elastin and senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) increased significantly after UV irradiation, whereas VitC and RP/HPR cotreatment can inhibit this increase. The synergistic stimulation of VitC and RP/HPR cotreatment showed higher efficacy in the recovery ability of skin injury. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated the advanced skin antiaging and whitening effects of VitC and RP/HPR cotreatment in vitro and in vivo. A combination of VitC and RP/HPR is a potent strategy to postpone skin aging and improve skin whitening for middle-aged women. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: 2020-LS-023.",

Here, we report that vitC directly modifies lysine residues to form \"vitcyl-lysine\"-a process termed vitcylation. Vitcylation occurs in a dose-, pH-, and sequence-dependent manner in both cell-free systems and living cells. Mechanistically, vitC vitcylates signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1)- lysine-298 (K298), impairing its interaction with T cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) and preventing STAT1-Y701 dephosphorylation. This leads to enhanced STAT1-mediated interferon (IFN) signaling in tumor cells, increased major histocompatibility complex (MHC)/human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression, and activation of anti-tumor immunity in vitro and in vivo. The discovery of vitcylation as a distinctive post-translational modification provides significant insights into vitC's cellular function and therapeutic potential, opening avenues for understanding its biological effects and applications in disease treatment.",

      "abstract": "Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is a precancerous lesion characterised by gastric mucosal atrophy and inflammation. Identifying key molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets is essential to improve patient outcomes. Key modules and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were recognised in the GSE153224 dataset using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and examination of differential expression. IGFBP7 was identified as a hub gene by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and expression validation. CAG patients' blood parameters and gastric mucosal health status were evaluated before and after the treatment of vitamin C (VC). In addition, we investigated the effects of VC and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) on GES-1 cells, including cell viability, apoptosis and the expression of inflammatory and angiogenic markers. WGCNA identified that the blue module was significantly associated with CAG with a correlation coefficient 0.924. Among 93 overlapping genes, IGFBP7 was notably underexpressed and selected as a hub gene. ROC analysis confirmed the high diagnostic performance of IGFBP7. CAG patients treated with VC showed significant improvement in blood parameters and improved gastric mucosal health. In vitro, VC increased cell viability, reduced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and lowered COX-2 and apoptosis-related protein expression in MNNG-treated GES-1 cells. Knockdown of IGFBP7 further influenced these effects. MNNG upregulated HIF-1α/VEGF signalling proteins, which VC attenuated. Combined VC and IGFBP7 knockdown showed potential protective effects. This study highlights the regulatory role of VC and IGFBP7 in CAG and demonstrates their potential as therapeutic targets for improving gastric mucosal health and mitigating inflammation.",

The effects of antenatal antioxidants on lung development in the chronically hypoxic growth restricted fetus is unknown. METHODS: We investigated the effect of maternal daily Vitamin C (200 mg/kg i.v. vs. Saline) for a month in late gestation on molecular markers regulating lung maturation between normoxic normally grown and hypoxic growth-restricted fetal sheep. Chronic fetal hypoxia and fetal growth restriction were induced by exposure to maternal chronic hypoxia (10% O2 vs. Normoxia=21% O2) from 105-138 d gestation (term=145 d). RESULTS: The data show a differential effect of antenatal Vitamin C treatment on regulation of genes involved in surfactant maturation, sodium movement and hypoxia signaling. Limited responsiveness to antenatal Vitamin C exposure in the lung of the hypoxic fetus, compared to responsiveness to antenatal Vitamin C in the normoxic fetus, suggests a maximal upregulation of the molecular signaling pathways in response to the chronic hypoxic insult alone. CONCLUSION: We provide molecular insight into the heterogeneity of antenatal Vitamin C treatment on development of the normoxic and growth restricted hypoxic fetal lung. IMPACT: The effect of maternal Vitamin C on molecular markers of lung maturation between normoxic normally grown and hypoxic growth restricted fetal sheep was unknown. We show a differential effect of Vitamin C with a greater increase in molecular markers of lung maturation in normoxic compared with hypoxic fetuses. Limited responsiveness in the hypoxic fetal lung is likely due to maximal upregulation by the hypoxic insult alone, thus added exposure to Vitamin C is unable to upregulate the system further. The work highlights the need to understand differential effects of antenatal interventions in healthy and complicated pregnancy, prior to clinical translation."

      "abstract": "Rosehip (Rosa canina L.) is a perennial medicinal plant from the Rosaceae family. Due to its important bioactive compounds and oil, its use in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries is expanding. As elicitation is an effective strategy for the production of secondary metabolites and oil, this study aimed to investigate the exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA) (0, 1, 2, and 3 mM) and jasmonic acid (JA) (0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mM) on the accumulation and production of oil, the profile of seed fatty acids, as well as the content of phenolic acids, vitamin C, total carotenoid, anthocyanin, total phenolic content, and total flavonoid content of rosehip pericarp. Based on the results, applying SA and JA externally increased the seed oil content by 32.57% compared to the control. The treatment of 3 mM SA and 1.5 mM JA resulted in the highest (11.68%) seed oil content. Eicosanoic acid and palmitic acid production increased under this treatment, while the amount of linoleic acid decreased as the concentrations of SA and JA increased. There was a significant increase in the amount of phenolic acids in rosehip pericarp extract under the influence of SA and JA treatments. Spraying with 3 mM SA and 1.5 mM JA increased vitamin C content and total phenol content by 50.44% and 39.13%, respectively, compared to the control. Additionally, the treatment of 2 mM SA and 1.5 mM JA resulted in the highest total flavonoid content, antioxidant activity, and total carotenoid. These results suggest that using appropriate concentrations of SA and JA as biodegradable, fast, and cost-effective stimulants can be a suitable solution for increasing the production of seed oil content and secondary metabolites of rosehip extract on a large scale, supplying raw material for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries.",

      "abstract": "Ascorbic acid, the reduced form of vitamin C, is a ubiquitous small carbohydrate. Despite decades of focused research, new metabolic functions of this universal electron donor are still being discovered and add to the complexity of our view of vitamin C in human health. Although praised as an unsurpassed water-soluble antioxidant in plasma and cells, the most interesting functions of vitamin C seem to be its roles as specific electron donor in numerous biological reactions ranging from the well-known hydroxylation of proline to cofactor for the epigenetic master regulators ten-eleven translocation enzymes and Jumonji domain-containing histone-lysine demethylases. Some of these functions may have important implications for disease prevention and treatment and have spiked renewed interest in, eg, vitamin C's potential in cancer therapy. Moreover, some fundamental pharmacokinetic properties of vitamin C remain to be established including if other mechanisms than passive diffusion governs the efflux of ascorbate anions from the cell. Taken together, there still seems to be much to learn about the pharmacology of vitamin C and its role in health and disease. This review explores new avenues of vitamin C and integrates our present knowledge of its pharmacology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Vitamin C is involved in multiple biological reactions of which most are essential to human health. Hundreds of millions of people are considered deficient in vitamin C according to accepted guidelines, but little is known about the long-term consequences. Although the complexity of vitamin C's physiology and pharmacology has been widely disregarded in clinical studies for decades, it seems clear that a deeper understanding of particularly its pharmacology holds the key to unravel and possibly exploit the potential of vitamin C in disease prevention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine use during pregnancy remains a widespread problem in obstetrics, leading to complications such as intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome. Consistent education by medical personnel is essential, as no medication or supplement has been found to prevent the dangers of nicotine use during pregnancy. If a pregnant woman is unable to quit nicotine despite intensive efforts, vitamin C, with its antioxidant properties, may help mitigate these risks, as suggested by some studies. This review summarizes current knowledge based on publications related to vitamin C, nicotine, and pregnancy. Research was conducted on the medical literature platforms PubMed and Cochrane Library, using all relevant studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. The identified studies primarily examined the impact of maternal smoking and nicotine on placental function, as well as the respiratory, cardiac, neuronal, and bone systems of the offspring. They suggest that vitamin C has a generally positive preventive or protective effect, though no study has shown complete compensation for the damage caused by nicotine. Nicotine abstinence remains the most crucial preventive measure. If this is not achievable despite intensive efforts by medical personnel, vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy may be considered. With a very low side effect profile, a daily dose of up to 500 mg can be recommended. However, further studies are necessary to provide reliable data on the effectiveness and appropriate dosage, given an ethically justifiable study approach.",

      "abstract": "Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a prevalent condition leading to significant morbidity and affecting quality of life. Among conservative treatment strategies, venoactive drugs are often recommended by major guidelines for the management of CVD. Bromelain and vitamin C are now emerging as promising options in the management of several chronic diseases owing to their anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and antioxidant properties, though evidence remains scarce in this setting. This systematic review of the literature, endorsed by the Italian Society of Angiology and Vascular Medicine (Societa Italiana di Angiologia e Patologia Vascolare, SIAPAV), aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these compounds in the treatment of CVD. A comprehensive search yielded nine studies, two on bromelain and seven on vitamin C. No studies have evaluated the effects of bromelain and vitamin C alone or in combination, whereas both molecules were administered in combination with other nutritional supplements. Overall, CVD-related symptoms and edema seem to improve with dietary supplement containing these two compounds, with no major safety issues reported. Bromelain and vitamin C may thus represent attractive options in the management of patients with symptomatic CVD and/or presence of venous edema, provided optimal conservative treatment is in place. Dedicated clinical studies are needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of a combination of these molecules in CVD management."

In this study, we evaluated neuroprotective effects of vitamin C on the neonatal HI brain injury mouse model. METHODS: Brain damage measurement, sensorimotor function in the neonatal period, learning and memory ability in adulthood were carried out in mice treated with vitamin C daily for 7 consecutive days following HI brain injury at postnatal day 7. RESULTS: Vitamin C treatment significantly reduced the hippocampus damage area, infarction volume, hippocampal neuron loss, and suppressed the neuroinflammation after HI injury. Additionally, it improved performance on neonatal sensorimotor function tests and learning and memory ability in adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C reduced brain injury and improved functional recovery in the neonatal hypoxic ischemia brain damage (HIBD) model. IMPACT: Vitamin C treatment significantly reduced neuron loss and suppressed the neuroinflammation after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Vitamin C treatment enhanced sensorimotor functions in neonates and improved cognitive abilities in adults after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Vitamin C could be an attractive candidate drug in clinical trials of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy therapy."

One proposed biologic mechanism underlying ASD is oxidative stress, leading to the clinical use of glutathione based on anecdotal reports of improved behavior in autistic children. In this pilot study, we tested this observation using a randomized clinical trial format to collect preliminary data on glutathione safety and efficacy. METHODS: Glutathione and glutathione in combination with vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine (Trio) were tested. Both treatments were administered in double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover studies. In total, 24 children between the ages of 5 and 16 years with ASD and severe behavior disorders were randomized to receive weekly intravenous injections of either placebo or 1 of the 2 interventions (glutathione or Trio) for 8 weeks. After a 1-week washout period, participants were crossed over for the subsequent 8 weeks. Behavioral measures and plasma levels of glutathione were obtained at baseline, during the washout period, and at the end of the study. RESULTS: No differences between treatment groups in behavioral or biologic measures were found. No significant adverse side effects attributable to the treatments were observed. Small improvements in specific glutathione and behavioral measures occurred over the study period for all groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment with glutathione or glutathione in combination with vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine did not result in improvements in behavior or biologic measures. The positive trends over the course of the study were likely due to the placebo effect or decreased anxiety associated with the study routine.",

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin is known for its significant cardiotoxicity, in part due to increased oxidative stress (OS). In addition, preclinical models have shown that doxorubicin induces skeletal muscle atrophy. While vitamin C has been recognized as a valuable pharmacological intervention to mitigate cardiac toxicity, its effect on doxorubicin-induced skeletal muscle atrophy remains to be determined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin C on skeletal muscle of rats exposed to doxorubicin. Indeed, doxorubicin caused a reduction in body weight and gastrocnemius muscle weight, accompanied by an increase in hydrogen peroxide, protein oxidation, and lipid peroxidation in the gastrocnemius muscle. On the other hand, vitamin C was able to prevent the loss of skeletal muscle mass as well as the increase in markers of OS. In addition, negative correlations were found between gastrocnemius muscle mass and markers of cellular damage. In conclusion, vitamin C appears to be a protective agent against doxorubicin-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and OS. This suggests its potential application as a prophylactic measure for patients undergoing doxorubicin treatment."

Vitamin C (VitC) is a strong antioxidant with cell protective efficacy and scavenges free radicals. METHOD: The present study evaluated VitC for potential protective effects against EC-induced memory impairment in rat models. The animals were exposed to EC for 2 hr/day, with a one-hour break in between, for five days per week over four weeks. Simultaneously, animals were administered Vitamin C at 100 mg/kilogram/bw/day via oral gavage five days/week/for four weeks. After the treatment and exposure period concluded, spatial learning and memory were evaluated using the Radial Arms Water Maze. Furthermore, the oxidative stress biomarkers levels (GSSG, GSH, GSH/ GSSG, TBARS, Catalase, and GPx) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured in the hippocampus tissues. The findings indicated that EC had a detrimental effect on the short-term and long-term memory of the animals (p < 0.05). Additionally, EC decreased the levels of GPx, SOD, GSH, the GSH/GSSG ratio, and BDNF (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Furthermore, the GSSG level was significantly elevated (p < 0.05) by EC. However, Vitamin C prevented impairment of memory and restored levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress and BDNF. CONCLUSION: To summarize, exposure to EC resulted in impairments of memory, both short-term and long-term. However, the administration of Vitamin C prevented these negative effects by its antioxidant properties."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Autism, a developmental-neurodegenerative disorder, often manifests as social communication difficulties and has been correlated to oxidative stress in the brain. Vitamins C and gallic acid (GA) possess potent antioxidant properties, making them potential candidates for addressing autism-related issues. This study examined the influence of vitamin C (Vit C) and GA on behavioral, motor, and cognitive performance, along with the assessment of brain oxidative markers, using an experimental model of autism. METHOD: Fourteen female rats were divided into saline and valproic acid (VPA) groups, and mating with mature male rats generated offspring. VPA (500 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) on gestational day (GD) 12.5. Male pups remained undisturbed for 29 days. On postnatal day (PND) 30, 48 male pups were randomly selected and administered daily injections of Vit C (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or GA (30 mg/kg, i.p.) for 4 weeks (PND 38-65). Behavioral assessments were conducted before and after treatment (PND 30-37 and 66-73). Animals were then anesthetized, and their brains were analyzed for oxidative stress markers. FINDING: The prenatal VPA-induced autism model increased nociceptive threshold, heightened anxiety-like behaviors, impaired balance power, delayed spatial learning, elevated malondialdehyde, and decreased glutathione and catalase levels in the brains of the male offspring. Administration of Vit C and GA effectively mitigated these anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: Vit C and GA could potentially alleviate anxiety-like behaviors, motor and cognitive deficits, and brain oxidative stress markers in a prenatal rat autism model. This underscores their viability as potential pharmacological interventions for treating autistic dysfunction.",

Clinical parameters, including gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL), were assessed at baseline and at one week, one month, and three months post treatment. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, all groups showed significant improvements in periodontal parameters (p ≤ 0.001). At three months, the group receiving both melatonin and vitamin C demonstrated the greatest reduction in PD (mean reduction: 1.96 mm, p ≤ 0.001) and CAL (mean reduction: 1.87 mm, p ≤ 0.001). This group also achieved the most significant improvement in GI (mean reduction: 1.74, p ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The combined adjunctive therapy of melatonin and vitamin C demonstrated superior improvements in periodontal indices compared to NSPT alone, supporting its potential as an effective adjunctive treatment for chronic periodontitis."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic fetal hypoxia is commonly associated with fetal growth restriction and can predispose to respiratory disease at birth and in later life. Antenatal antioxidant treatment has been investigated to overcome the effects of oxidative stress in utero to improve respiratory outcomes. We aimed to determine if the effects of chronic fetal hypoxia and antenatal antioxidant administration persist in the lung in early adulthood. METHODS: Chronically catheterised pregnant sheep were exposed to normoxia (N; n = 20) or hypoxia (H; n = 18; 10% O2) ± maternal daily i. v. saline (N = 11; H = 8) or Vitamin C (VC; NVC = 9; HVC = 10) from 105 to 138 days (term, ∼145 days). Lungs were collected from female lambs 9 months after birth (early adulthood). Lung tissue expression of genes and proteins regulating oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, hypoxia signalling, glucocorticoid signalling, surfactant maturation, inflammation and airway remodelling were measured. RESULTS: Chronic fetal hypoxia upregulated lung expression of markers of prooxidant, surfactant lipid transport and airway remodelling pathways in early adulthood. Antenatal Vitamin C normalized prooxidant and airway remodelling markers, increased endogenous antioxidant, vasodilator and inflammatory markers, and altered regulation of hypoxia signalling and glucocorticoid availability. CONCLUSION: There are differential effects of antenatal Vitamin C on molecular markers in the lungs of female lambs from normoxic and hypoxic pregnancy in early adulthood."

      "abstract": "High intraocular pressure (IOP) is an important risk factor for glaucoma, which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. However, the etiology of high IOP remains uncertain. Metabolites are compounds involved in metabolism which provide a link between the internal (genetic) and external environments. O-methylascorbate has been reported to be associated with IOP. In addition, researchers have identified several genetic variants which are associated with metabolite concentrations, including O-methylascorbate and another vitamin C related metabolite, ascorbic acid 2-sulfate. We aimed to understand how O-methylascorbate and ascorbic acid 2-sulfate, or genetic variants associated with these metabolites, modify the associations between dietary environmental variables and IOP. We used data from 8060 participants of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Using linear models adjusted for relevant covariates, we tested for interactions between six genetic variants previously found to be associated with O-methylascorbate and ascorbic acid 2-sulfate and four environmental variables related to diet (alcohol consumption frequency, smoking status, fruit consumption, and vegetable consumption). We also tested for interactions between serum concentrations of O-methylascorbate and ascorbic acid 2-sulfate and these environmental factors. We used a False Discovery Rate approach to correct for the 32 interaction tests performed. One interaction was suggestively significant after multiple testing correction (adjusted P-value < 0.1): rs8050812 and alcohol consumption frequency. Understanding how genetic variants and metabolites interact with the environment could shed light on biological pathways controlling IOP and lead to improved prevention and treatment of glaucoma.",

The aim is to evaluate the effect of vitamin C (VitC) in CHX mouthwash on plaque accumulation and gingivitis, and to compare it with CHX alone mouthwash and antiseptic phenol-containing mouthwashes. This study conducted as a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel design clinical study. Sixty patients were included, randomly divided into three groups. 1. Antiseptic phenol agent (P, Phenol), 2. Antiseptic bisbiguanide agent CHX-only (CHX) and 3. Antiseptic bisbiguanide agent CHX + VitC mouthwash (CHX + VitC). The study assessed oral hygiene and periodontal health status, followed by scaling and root planning (SRP) and subsequent polishing. After using the mouthwash for 60 s twice daily along 14 days, patients recalled for evaluation of plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP) and staining. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the differences formed between groups and Tukey multiple comparison analysis was used to determine groups that showed the differences. Statistical significance was determined using a p-value threshold of 0.05. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding baseline PI, GI and BOP (p > 0.05). Changes at 14th day in PI, GI and BOP in all groups were similar and no significant differences were observed (p > 0.05). Regarding 'all surfaces', staining density of two mouthwashes containing CHX was significantly higher than that of P mouthwash. CHX, CHX + VitC, and P mouthwashes appeared to exhibit comparable effects as oral hygiene adjuncts to periodontal mechanical treatment, with the exception of staining, which was more noticeable in the CHX groups compared to the P group. Adding vitamin C did not enhance the effects of CHx alone.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin C is an antioxidant and is essential for immune function and infection resistance. Supplementation is necessary when a sufficient amount of vitamin C is not obtained through the diet. Alternative formulations of vitamin C may enhance its bioavailability and retention over traditional ascorbic acid. This systematic review consolidates the evidence on this and the effects on immunity and infection. A systematic literature search was conducted in October 2024 in Embase and Medline, focused on healthy adults (Population); oral forms of liposomal-encapsulated ascorbic acid, liposomal-encapsulated lipid metabolite ascorbic acid, calcium ascorbate, slow-release ascorbic acid, or lipid metabolite ascorbic acid (Intervention); compared to placebo/others (Comparison); in terms of bioavailability, absorption, vitamin C concentration in plasma, serum, and leukocytes, and impacts on tolerability, immunity, and infection (Outcome); and included randomized or non-randomized controlled trials, single-arm trials, and observational studies (Study design). Thirteen studies were included, several evaluating calcium ascorbate in combination with vitamin C metabolites, including L-threonate, referred to here as Calcium ascorbate EC (Ester C®; n = 7). No safety or tolerability concerns were noted with Calcium ascorbate EC vs. placebo or ascorbic acid. Calcium ascorbate EC showed better tolerability and fewer epigastric adverse events, improved quality of life, and induced favorable oxalate changes vs. ascorbic acid. Four studies reported leukocyte vitamin C concentration, some showing higher concentrations with Calcium ascorbate EC vs. ascorbic acid; seven reported more favorable plasma concentrations with the alternative forms over ascorbic acid or placebo; one reported higher serum vitamin C levels with vitamin C lipid metabolites than with Calcium ascorbate EC, calcium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid. No study reported retention in tissues. One study reported a favorable impact of Calcium ascorbate EC on immune parameters, and one found an association of Calcium ascorbate EC with fewer colds and a shorter duration of severe symptoms vs. placebo. Findings suggest that alternative vitamin C forms can improve leukocyte vitamin C, sometimes without affecting plasma levels. Most studies (77%) had a low risk of bias. In conclusion, the type and delivery modality of vitamin C can impact its bioavailability and functionality. Studies highlight the advantages of Calcium ascorbate EC over traditional ascorbic acid in terms of its tolerability and its potential to increase leukocyte vitamin C concentrations, crucial for immune function and protection against infection. However, further research is required to conclusively establish its effects on immune health.",

It causes oxidative stress in nerve tissue and has neurotoxic effects. A strong antioxidant and effective free radical scavenger is vitamin C. The current research aims to investigate the potential protective impact of vitamin C and the toxic consequences of methotrexate. &lt;strong&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Thirty-six rats were used in this research and group one (Group 1) got no treatment at all. For 4 weeks, (Group 2) underwent a single intraperitoneal injection of methotrexate at a dose of 20 mg/kg once a week and (Group 3) got methotrexate at the same dosage as Group 2 and vitamin C (20 mg/kg) intragastrically every other day for four weeks. Rats were killed after the experiment and brain hemispheres were removed and prepared for light microscopic analysis. The cerebral hemispheres were ready for biochemical analysis to determine the brain tissue's concentrations of MDA, CAT, GSH and SOD. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software version 20. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; In the methotrexate (2)-treated group, there were histological alterations manifested as a reduction in granular layer thickness. Purkinje cells exhibit a reduction in number, a shrinking of the cell bodies and a loss of monolaminar organization. Reduced cellularity was seen in the molecular layer. These cellular alterations are lessened and the thickness of the granular and molecular cell layers is restored following vitamin C treatment. When compared to the MTX+Vitamin C group, vitamin C greatly attenuates the biochemical and histological alterations caused by MTX. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Results concluded that although methotrexate is a toxic medication that damages the brain cortex, its toxicity is reduced when vitamin C is taken with it.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgical methods of gingival depigmentation can be challenging, particularly if the gingival phenotype is thin due to the risk of gingival recession and bone exposure. Thus, exploring alternative, non-surgical, minimally invasive treatment modalities is warranted. In dermatology, vitamin C is extensively used for depigmentation and microneedling for collagen induction, with limited literature about its usage for improving gingival esthetics. The present preliminary case study aims to explore the synergistic use of vitamin C mesotherapy with microneedling for the esthetic management of physiologic melanin gingival hyperpigmentation. METHODS: Eleven arches from six patients having anterior physiologic melanin hyperpigmentation were recruited. Microneedling was done with a lancet, followed by intra-epidermal administration of 1.5-2 mL of vitamin C in pigmented gingiva (once weekly/four sessions). Dummett oral pigmentation index (DOPI), gingival pigmentation index (GPI), pigmented surface area (PSA), and gingival luminescence (L*) were assessed at baseline and follow-up visits of 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Gingival thickness (GT) was recorded at baseline and 3 months. Pain, itching, and gingival color were also assessed. RESULTS: A significant reduction (p < 0.05) in mean DOPI, GPI, and PSA was observed from baseline to 3 months, while L* and GT increased significantly within that timeframe. Patients reported an improvement in gingival color at 1 and 3 months. Low pain and itching scores were obtained post-treatment. CONCLUSION: Vitamin C mesotherapy with microneedling is a newer, minimally invasive approach that can effectively reduce gingival melanin pigmentation intensity and extent, and can potentially increase the gingival thickness. KEY POINTS: Vitamin C mesotherapy (intra-epidermal injection) is an effective and minimally invasive treatment modality for gingival depigmentation. The adjunctive use of microneedling with vitamin C mesotherapy can potentially increase gingival thickness non-surgically. Non-surgical methods for gingival depigmentation can be chosen as an alternative to surgical methods for esthetic management of physiologic melanin hyperpigmentation in cases with thin gingival phenotype. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Patients seek treatment for hyperpigmented gingiva caused by increased melanin to improve the smile esthetics. Conventional surgical methods for gingival depigmentation, however, are challenging to perform in areas of thin gingiva as there is an increased risk of gingival damage and bone exposure. Thus, exploring alternative, non-surgical, minimally invasive options will be advantageous. In dermatology, vitamin C is a popular agent for treating skin hyperpigmentation, and microneedling is a technique used for collagen induction. This preliminary case study synergistically used local vitamin C injections (mesotherapy) in gingiva with microneedling to manage gingival hyperpigmentation in eleven arches from six patients. Microneedling was done with a lancet, following which 1.5-2 mL of vitamin C was injected intra-epidermally in pigmented gingiva (once weekly for four sessions). From baseline to three months, a significant reduction in melanin pigmentation intensity and extent was observed as assessed by clinical and photographic parameters. Gingival thickness increased significantly within that timeframe. Patients reported favorable outcomes with improved gingival color with low pain and itching scores. Vitamin C mesotherapy with microneedling is a newer, minimally invasive, effective, non-surgical treatment modality for achieving gingival depigmentation and improving gingival thickness. The results need further validation in future studies with large sample sizes and long-term follow-up."

This study examined whether combining Silymarin (SIL) with Vitamin C (Vit C) enhances protection against lithium-induced nephrotoxicity in rats, comparing their individual antioxidant effects as well. Rats subjected to Li exposure were provided with a standard commercial diet supplemented with 80 mmol LiCl per kilogram for 28 days. Concurrently, SIL and Vit C were administered orally at dosages of 200 and 100 mg/kg body weight, respectively, throughout the 28 days. The study assessed levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as the enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), to evaluate the protective effects of SIL and Vit C against oxidative stress. Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) levels in kidney tissues were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Serum and urine parameters (sodium, potassium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], and urea) and serum lithium levels were also measured. Lithium-induced nephrotoxicity showed increased renal toxicity markers and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity. SIL administration significantly reduced markers of kidney tissue toxicity, increased antioxidant enzyme activities, regulated the aforementioned physiological parameters in blood and urine, and downregulated AQP2 expression in the kidney. However, Vit C administration did not demonstrate a significant protective effect against lithium-induced renal toxicity. These findings indicate that SIL effectively protects against lithium-induced nephrotoxicity, whereas Vitamin C does not exhibit this protective effect."

      "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of the efficacy of vitamin C for preventing and treating respiratory infections. Studies in a wide variety of animals have shown vitamin C to be protective against infections. In controlled trials in the general human population, vitamin C at a dose greater than 1 g/day did not prevent common colds. However, in 5 trials with participants undertaking heavy physical activity, vitamin C halved the incidence of colds. In 15 trials (n = 6244), regular supplementation of 1 g or more of vitamin C per day decreased the severity of colds by 15%. Results of therapeutic trials in which vitamin C was initiated after the onset of common cold symptoms have been inconsistent. However, 2 therapeutic trials found that 6-8 g/day of vitamin C was twice as effective at reducing the duration of colds as 3-4 g/day. In 3 controlled trials, vitamin C was shown to prevent pneumonia, but the contexts were atypical: the participants were schoolboys attending a boarding school in the United Kingdom before World War II, soldiers hospitalized for influenza A, and United States Marine recruits. It is unlikely that vitamin C would reduce the risk of pneumonia in the general population; however, 4 trials reported a treatment benefit for pneumonia patients, although the findings encourage further research rather than providing firm evidence of efficacy. Vitamin C has been tested for efficacy in COVID‑19 and sepsis with conflicting results. Given the evidence that vitamin C reduces the severity and duration of the common cold, paired with its good safety profile and low cost, it is not unreasonable for patients to test whether therapeutic vitamin C supplementation at a dose of 6-8 g/day is beneficial at the individual level.",

      "abstract": "Radiation therapy is one of the most effective treatments for approximately 60% of patients with cancer. During radiation exposure, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) disrupts the lipid layer of the membrane, leading to subsequent peroxide radical formation. Cimetidine (Cim) and famotidine (Fam) are histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2 blocker), also known as peptic ulcer drugs, that exert radioprotective effects. Vitamin C (Vit.C) is an effective free radical and ROS scavenger with significant radioprotective effects. In this experimental study, male mice (6-8 weeks and 28 ± 3 g) were used in five groups. To evaluate ionizing radiation, gamma rays were used at two doses of 2 and 4 Gy and different doses of Cim, Fam, and Vit.C administered as the protectives. Finally, the livers of the mice were isolated and homogenized. The levels of lipid peroxidase and reduced and oxidized glutathione were measured using standard methods. With increasing radiation dose, lipid peroxidase activity, GSSG level, and glutathione content increased. The findings showed that in the drug-only group, Vit.C had better protection than the other two drugs, and the combination of the three drugs had excellent radiation protection. Radiation protection of normal cells in radiotherapy is a valuable necessity. A number of drugs can protect cells against ionizing radiation through different mechanisms. The results suggest that Fam, Cim, and Vit.C can be radioprotective individually or in combination."

The objective of this work was to identify the reprotoxic effects of Ampligo® 150 ZC (AP), a mixture formulation of lambda cyhalothrin and chlorantraniliprole, on the ovary of female rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and the possible protective effect of co-treatment with thyme essential oil (TEO), extracted from (Thymus vulgaris) species, and vitamin C (vit C). Twenty female rabbits were divided into four equal groups (n = 5): Control (distilled water), AP (20 mg/ kg bw of the insecticide mixture every other day, by gavage for 28 days), AP+TEO (20 mg/ kg bw of AP + 0.5 mg/ kg bw of TEO every other day), and AP+TEO+Vit C (20 mg/ kg bw of AP + 0.5 mg/ kg bw of TEO + 200 mg/ kg bw of vitamin C every other day). The effects were tested on body weight, ovary histomorphometry, and immunohistochemical expression of AFP, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR). The results revealed that AP decreased body and ovarian weights, caused ovarian histological damages, and increased collagen fiber deposition. The immunostaining of the ovary showed a significant (p < .001) increase in AFP and decrease in both ER and PR expressions. In the opposite, co-administration of TEO and vitamin C was effective in improving all caused alterations. In conclusion, combined use of TEO and vitamin C ameliorated the toxic effects of Ampligo® on the ovary in female rabbits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pharmacological vitamin C (Vit-C), or high-dose Vit-C has recently gained attention as a potential cancer therapeutic. However, the anticancer activity of Vit-C has not been investigated in realistic 3D models of human cancers, especially with respect to breast cancer (BC), and its potential benefits remain under debate. Herein, we investigate the activity and mechanism of action of pharmacological Vit-C on two BC tumor spheroids. METHODS: We developed two distinct types of BC tumor spheroids from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. The spheroids underwent treatment with a range of concentrations of pharmacological Vit-C (1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mM). Assessments were conducted to determine the cell viability, H2O2 levels, glutathione-to-glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratios, and apoptosis. Both flow cytometry analyses of Annexin V/PI staining and caspase3/7 activity assay were used to check apoptosis. RESULTS: We showed that Vit-C induced dose-dependent cell death in both types of tumor spheroids, primarily driven by elevated H2O2 production and a concomitant oxidative stress imbalance induced by the GSH depletion. The high levels of H2O2 generated by Vit-C triggered the apoptosis of spheroids. In MCF-7 spheroids, Vit-C-induced H2O2 production was higher, with a more pronounced decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio, indicating greater susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cell death. However, MDA-MB-231 spheroids exhibited a more severe cytotoxic response. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that Vit-C induces oxidative stress-mediated cell death in both non-aggressive and aggressive BC spheroids. Unlike traditional in vitro studies, this work provides novel insights into the response of two BC tumor subtypes to Vit-C, demonstrating its potential as a targeted common therapy for BC.",

Despite an initial lack of tumor reduction following chemotherapy, the patient showed a significant decrease in tumor markers and stabilization of the tumor after undergoing radiation and proton therapy. Subsequently, CIK cell therapy, combined with high-dose vitamin C, was administered 52 times over 6 years. The patient's tumor size reduced, and no cancer activity was detected for 7 years and 10 months post-diagnosis, indicating a successful long-term outcome without recurrence. This study suggests that CIK cell therapy, particularly in patients with elevated SVCT2 levels, may offer a promising adjuvant treatment for cholangiocarcinoma and potentially other cancers. Further research is needed to validate SVCT2 as a biomarker for the effectiveness of CIK cell therapy."

      "abstract": "Background and objective Vitamin C and thiamine possess properties that may mitigate the harmful effects of sepsis. However, there is a dearth of studies in the literature comparing these two vitamins with each other and with a placebo regarding their efficacy against sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes associated with high-dose infusions of vitamin C and thiamine in septic patients, thereby seeking to contribute valuable insights into the optimal management of sepsis. The primary objective was to compare the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and C-reactive protein (CRP) level improvement on Day Six among the vitamin C, thiamine, and placebo groups after the intervention for five days. Methodology This prospective randomized comparative study involved 75 patients. Patients were randomized into three groups of 25 each. The first group received high-dose vitamin C infusion along with standard treatment for sepsis; the second group received high-dose thiamine infusion along with standard treatment for sepsis; and the third group, the placebo group, received only standard treatment for sepsis for five days. The SOFA score, CRP level, and other parameters were evaluated on Day Six. Results The SOFA score (p=0.043) and CRP level (p=0.0161) on Day Six were lower in the vitamin C group than in the placebo group. The CRP level on Day Six was significantly lower in the thiamine group than in the placebo group (p=0.016). The duration of vasopressor therapy was significantly lower in the vitamin C group than in the placebo group (p=0.0276) and the thiamine group (p=0.0236). Conclusions Based on our findings, vitamin C infusion helps improve the SOFA score and CRP level in sepsis patients. It can also decrease the duration of vasopressor therapy and serious adverse events whereas thiamine can reduce CRP levels in these patients."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We hypothesised that the biological heterogeneity of sepsis may highlight sepsis subtypes with differences in response to intravenous vitamin C treatment in the Lessening Organ Dysfunction with VITamin C (LOVIT) trial. Our aims were to identify sepsis subtypes and to test whether sepsis subtypes have differences in treatment effect to vitamin C and describe putative biological effects of vitamin C treatment. METHODS: We measured biomarkers of inflammation, at baseline and at 7 days post-randomisation, in 457/863 (53.0%) of participants with plasma samples in the LOVIT trial. We used agglomerative hierarchical clustering on log10-transformed baseline data of 26 biomarkers to identify sepsis subtypes. We analysed differences in vitamin C treatment effect with regression models incorporating robust standard errors to report odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals (OR(95% CI)). All analyses were completed blinded to treatment allocation. RESULTS: Our cohort included 233/429 (54.3%) allocated to vitamin C and 224/434 (51.6%) allocated to placebo. A three-subtype model best explained the variance in our data. Subtype-2 had the highest, and subtype-3 had the lowest levels of inflammatory response. In paired longitudinal samples, vitamin C did not have discernible anti-inflammatory effects, with anti-inflammatory effects related to time since randomisation and concomitant hydrocortisone treatment. The treatment effect estimates (OR (95% CI)) for subtype-1, subtype-2 and subtype-3 were 1.04 (0.63-1.73), 1.33 (0.53-3.36) and 1.95 (0.85-4.49), respectively (test of heterogeneity p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: We report three sepsis subtypes based on inflammatory response profile. No subtype benefitted from vitamin C treatment in the LOVIT trial, with heterogeneity of treatment effect in the magnitude of harm.

      "abstract": "DNA methylation and demethylation are key epigenetic events that regulate gene expression and cell fate. DNA demethylation via oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is typically mediated by TET (ten-eleven translocation) enzymes. The 5hmC modification is considered an intermediate state of DNA demethylation; it is particularly prevalent in the brain and is believed to play a role in the development of many cell types in the brain. Our previous studies have identified that vitamin C (Vc) and MEK inhibitor PD0325901 could significantly promote OPC (oligodendrocyte progenitor cell)-to-OL (oligodendrocyte) differentiation. Here we discovered that Vc and PD0325901 may promote OPC-to-OL differentiation by inducing DNA demethylation via hydroxymethylation. Blocking 5hmC formation almost totally blocked Vc- and PD0325901-stimulated OPC-to-OL differentiation. In addition, TET1 is not involved in Vc,- and PD0325901-promoted OL generation. We also found a synergistic effect between the two compounds in inducing OL generation, suggesting the possibility of a combination therapy for demyelination diseases in the future.",

Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplementation is reported to be a useful treatment for tendinopathy recovery. We compared the inhibitory effects of various ascorbic acid doses on tendon cell damage. H2O2 was added to human-derived tendon cells in vitro (Group H2O2, control), followed by incubation with 150 µM or 30 mM of ascorbic acid (Group C, Group HC). The oxidative injury degree was evaluated by determining reactive oxygen species levels. The cytoskeletal structure was examined via fluorescence immunostaining of actin filaments. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to analyze the expressions of mitochondria transcription factor A, adenosine triphosphate 5A, type I collagen, and p16. Cell death was reduced, and oxidative stress was inhibited in C and HC groups. The cytoskeleton was maintained in the HC group but not in the C group. qPCR analysis revealed that p16 expression was inhibited in both the C and HC groups compared to the H2O2 group; other markers had increased expression. The progression of cell death and cytoskeletal disruption was inhibited by the administration of high-dose vitamin C. Hence, high-dose vitamin C is a potential treatment for tendon cell degeneration.",

Materials and Methods: A case series derived from a randomized controlled trial was conducted to explore the effects of daily vitamin C supplementation, with or without flavonoids, on periodontal conditions. The study population was recruited from patients with periodontitis who had been referred to the Department of Periodontology at the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA). The study consisted of a 2-month observation of untreated periodontitis followed by a 3-month period after NSPT. Descriptive statistics, correlation and clustering analyses, and dimensionality reduction methods were used to evaluate the interventions' impact. Results: Due to COVID-19, the study was prematurely terminated and reported findings from 13 patients. Results indicate a correlation between higher plasma vitamin C levels and reduced gingival inflammation, suggesting benefits for untreated periodontal conditions. Clustering analysis showed no differences based on supplementation type, indicating it did not affect outcomes, and microbiological data had limited effects. Principal Component Analysis visualized clusters and illustrated no distinct groups corresponding to supplementation types. Violin plots highlighted variability, with one cluster comprising individuals with more severe periodontal conditions. Conclusions: Higher plasma vitamin C levels were associated with lower gingival inflammation. However, daily vitamin C supplementation, with or without flavonoids, did not show additional benefits on periodontal conditions before or after treatment. Clustering suggests that periodontal severity, rather than supplementation, influenced patient profiles. The study's small sample size limits the generalizability of the findings."

Multiple studies have demonstrated the beneficial role of a combination therapy of vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine in patients with sepsis and septic shock in terms of mortality reduction, and increase in the number of days free of ventilators and vasopressors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who had septic shock were assessed for eligibility after intensive care unit (ICU) admission. After randomization, the treatment group received a combination of vitamin C, thiamine and hydrocortisone for a duration of 96 hours (16 doses) and the control group received hydrocortisone for a duration till the patient was on vasopressors. The primary outcome assessed was ICU mortality, and the key secondary outcome was the duration free of vasopressor administration at the end of 7 days. RESULTS: A total of 86 patients were included in the study. Seventy percent of patients in the control group and 58 percent in the intervention group died during ICU stay. None of the primary and secondary outcomes were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The use of a combination of vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine has no added benefits over the use of hydrocortisone alone in patients with septic shock. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this clinical trial shows that the use of a combination of vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine in patients with septic shock is not useful and should not be a routine practice in critically ill septic patients.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence has shown that vitamin C has analgesic and opioid sparing properties in immediate postoperative context. However, this has never been studied for acute musculoskeletal (MSK) emergency department (ED) injuries. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomized placebo-controlled study to determine the opioid sparing and analgesic effect of vitamin C compared to placebo, in acute MSK injured ED patients. METHODS: A double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) distributed in two arms, stratified for fractures, was performed in a tertiary care center, one group receiving 1 g of vitamin C twice a day for 14 days and another receiving placebo. Participants were ≥18 years of age, treated in ED for MSK injuries present for ≤2 weeks, and discharged with a standardized opioid prescription of 20 morphine 5 mg tablets (M5T) and, at the clinician discretion, 28 tablets of naproxen 500 mg. Participants completed a 14-day paper diary and were contacted by phone at 14 days, to document their analgesic use, vitamin C consumption, and pain intensity. RESULTS: Overall, 137 patients were screened; 44(32%) were excluded, 38(40.9%) refused, leaving 55(59.1%) participants, with a consent rate of 9.2/month. Mean age was 53 years (SD = 16) and 55% were men. Fourteen (25%) participants were lost to follow-up and 33(83%) patients complied with treatment. For per-protocol analysis, the median (IQR) M5T consumed was 6.5 (3.3-19.5) for the vitamin C and 9.0 (1.5-16.0) for placebo group. The median (IQR) naproxen 500 mg tablets consumed was 0 (0-9.8) for the vitamin C group and 20 (0-27) for the placebo arm. CONCLUSION: This pilot study supports the feasibility of a larger RCT on the opioid sparing and analgesic properties of vitamin C for acute MSK injured ED patients. Strategies to reduce the refusal and lost to follow-up rates are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05555576, ClinicalTrials.Gov PRS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Phenobarbital (PB), commonly used for epilepsy management, is associated with testicular dysfunction after prolonged use. This study aimed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of cranberry (CB) and vitamin C (Vit-C) on PB-induced reproductive toxicity in rats. METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups. G1 was the negative control, while G2 received PB (160 mg/kg orally) for one month. Groups G3 and G4 received PB followed by CB (500 mg/kg) and Vit-C (27 mg/kg) treatments, respectively. G5 received PB followed by a combined CB and Vit-C regimen. The levels of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reduced (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined using standard biochemical assays. Histological changes in testicular tissues were assessed, and caspase-3 expression was quantified via immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: PB exposure increased MDA levels, reduced SOD and CAT activity, and disrupted testicular histology, with elevated caspase-3 expression indicating heightened apoptosis. Treatment with CB or Vit-C significantly restored antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced MDA levels, and ameliorated histological abnormalities. Co-treatment with CB and Vit-C yielded the most pronounced protective effects, including reduced caspase-3 expression and improved testicular structure. CONCLUSION: CB and Vit-C demonstrate significant protective effects against PB-induced testicular toxicity, likely due to their antioxidative and anti-apoptotic properties. Co-administration of these agents offers an effective strategy to mitigate reproductive toxicities associated with prolonged PB use.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by synovial inflammation, cartilage damage, and bone loss. Although effective treatments are currently lacking, early interventions hold promise for alleviating RA symptoms. Inorganic nitrates and vitamin C (VC) are essential bioactive substances abundant in fruits and vegetables. Notably, nitrates and VC exhibit synergistic effects in a series of physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we aim to examine the combination of nitrate and VC for preventing RA in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. Nitrate partly reduced foot swelling and arthritis scores and was more effective when combined with VC. Histopathological and radiological analyses revealed that nitrate + VC treatment alleviated synovial hyperplasia and bone loss. Additionally, nitrate + VC lowered the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in serum as well as synovial tissue, decreased the expression of NF-κB and reduced the number of macrophages in synovial tissue. Compared to the CIA group, nitrate + VC decreased the levels of NLRP3 and GSDMD in macrophages, thus inhibiting pyroptosis. According to in vitro experiments, nitrate inhibited the activation of the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway in macrophages by conversion into nitrite. VC reduced the expression and phosphorylation of NF-κB in macrophages and thus reduced the expression levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. Therefore, nitrate/nitrite and VC may exert synergistic effects by blocking the interaction between NF-κB and NLRP3, further alleviating the inflammation and pyroptosis of macrophages, which provides a new strategy for RA prevention.",

      "abstract": "The present investigation \"Effect of essential oils and chia seed (Salvia hispanica) in fortification of pineapple jam.\" was conducted during the year 2022-2023 at the Post harvest laboratory of Horticulture Department, Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, Dhaka. The study investigated the effects of essential oil and chia seeds on the quality of pineapple jam. In this research, pineapple jam samples were prepared with varying essential oil such as Cinnamon essential oil and Lemongrass essential oil at range of 1000 ppm. The addition of essential oil significantly impacted the flavour profile of the jam, enhancing the fruity notes and providing a pleasant aroma in sustainable and eco-friendly way. Moreover, it exhibited antimicrobial properties, extending the shelf life of the jam. Chia seeds were incorporated into the jam at different levels (6.25 %, 12.5 %, 25 % and 50 %) to assess their influence on texture and nutritional content. The results indicated that chia seeds contributed to a thicker consistency and increased protein content, making the jam a potential source of dietary protein. The maximum pH was found to be 4.90 from treatment (  C 4 E 0    = 50 % chia and no Essential oil). The lowest pH was recorded at 3.63 for  C o E 2    = No chia seed and 1000 ppm Lemongrass Essential oil). The investigation shows that lemongrass essential oil (E2) showed the best result in vitamin C retention. In case of chia seed 50 % (C4) treatment showed the best protein content. Additionally, the seeds added a subtle crunch and nutty undertone to the product. From the research it can be concluded that the treatment (  C 4 E 2    = 50 % chia seed and 1000 ppm Lemongrass Essential oil) showed the best result in case of vitamin C retention and protein incorporation. But considering spread ability and appearance (  C 3 E 2    = 25 % chia seed and 1000 ppm Lemongrass Essential oil) can be considered as best treatment for consumers. This research is motivated by the need to develop healthier, nutrient-dense pineapple jam using natural preservatives and fortifying agents. By exploring the combined effects of essential oils and chia seeds in preserving vitamin C and improving the jam's overall nutritional value, this study aims to meet the increasing demand for functional foods that prioritize both health and taste. The outcomes could offer valuable insights into natural preservation techniques and fortification strategies, potentially contributing to more sustainable and consumer-friendly food products in the market."

Although some PAE may improve over time, persisting PAE might be esthetically undesirable for patients. The efficacy of various treatment options for PAE has been investigated in many studies but there exists no gold standard treatment modality. This current split face comparative study aimed to assess and compare the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin c solution 10% with microneedling versus Tranexamic acid solution (TXA) (50 mg/ml) with microneedling in treating patients with PAE. Four sessions were held, two weeks apart. The assessment was done 2 weeks after the last session via change in Clinical Erythema Assessment (CEA) score, Antera 3D camera parameter changes (average hemoglobin level and hemoglobin variation), and patient satisfaction scale. Also, side effects were documented. Our study showed that both topical vitamin C and TXA solutions after microneedling showed significant decrease in hemi-CEA score and Antera camera measures of both Hb variations and average Hb levels. However, TXA treated side showed superior improvement than the side treated with vitamin c. Also, there was great patient satisfaction on both treated sides. The side effects reported were transient and minimal. Microneedling with TXA solution is a safe, effective and readily available modality of PAE treatment and showed superior results over vitamin C solution. Antera 3D camera is an excellent objective tool for assessing even minimal changes in Hb level and variation.",

      "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are implicated as the underlying cause of tumor recurrence due to their refractoriness to conventional therapies. Targeting CSCs through novel approaches can hinder their survival and proliferation, potentially reducing the challenges associated with tumor relapse. Our previous study demonstrated that colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSCs) showed sensitivity to Vitamin C (Vit C), displaying a dose-responsive effect where low doses (2-10 µM) promoted cell proliferation while high doses induced cell death. In this study, we unraveled the mechanistic effects of low doses that, although induced proliferation, remarkably facilitated stemness reduction in HT-29 cell line-derived CR-CSCs. Our findings revealed that Vit C doses of 2 and 6 µM resulted in a reduction in stemness as evidenced by a reduced CD44+ cell population, representing CR-CSCs. The key finding was the remarkable increase in the expression of β-catenin protein following low-dose Vit C treatment, despite a reduction in stemness, accompanied by a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). The sequestration of upregulated β-catenin via E-cadherin to the cell membrane was identified as a mechanism for reduced stemness, MET, and differentiation of CR-CSCs. Importantly, the epithelial phenotype induced by low-dose Vit C rendered CR-CSCs sensitive to conventional treatments, enhancing chemosensitivity to Cisplatin, Paclitaxel, and 5-Fluorouracil by 60%-90%. These findings suggest that low dose Vit C could serve as an adjuvant to conventional therapeutic strategies for targeting advanced colorectal cancer by sensitizing CR-CSCs to chemotherapy and potentially reducing tumor recurrence.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: This study explored the relationship between serum vitamin C levels, antioxidant defense mechanisms, and the severity of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) among Romanian patients. Methods: This study enrolled 53 patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis at Victor Babes University Hospital in Craiova between January 2023 and August 2024. Participants were stratified into two groups based on their serum vitamin C levels: 26 patients with normal levels and 27 patients with low levels. Clinical, demographic, and biological parameters, including inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were assessed at baseline and after 60 days of TB treatment. Serum vitamin C levels were measured using ELISA. The persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was evaluated using sputum smear microscopy and culture at baseline and after 2 months of treatment. Results: The results showed that patients with low vitamin C levels had significantly higher baseline ESR (92.63 ± 27.69 mm/h) and CRP (43.89 ± 12.00 mg/L) levels compared to those with normal levels (ESR: 65.11 ± 13.27 mm/h, CRP: 31.19 ± 9.76 mg/L). After 60 days, 66.67% of patients with low vitamin C levels remained culture-positive compared to 26.92% in the normal vitamin C group (p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis indicated that vitamin C deficiency was significantly associated with a higher TB culture load. Conclusions: These findings suggest that vitamin C deficiency may contribute to the persistence of MTB and highlight the potential role of vitamin C supplementation as an adjunct to standard TB treatment, particularly in the context of global efforts to eradicate the disease by 2035."

Oxidative stress induced by BPA is known to affect the brain, liver, and kidneys. Vitamin C is an important dietary antioxidant which is known decreases the oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species. Hence the current study was focused to evaluate the damaging effect of BPA on kidney and the role of ascorbic acid on BPA induced kidney toxicity. MATERIAL & METHODS: There were four groups of rats(6 rats in each); Group 1: Control Group (Olive oil treated) Group 2:(Vitamin C treated), Group 3: (Bispenol treated), Group 4: (Vitamin C + Bispenol treated). One kidney homogenized to measure Melonaldihyde level and glutathione and other kidney was used to study the histopathlogical parmeters. Biochemical estimation of serum electrolyte was done by commercially available kits using spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Animals exposed to Bisphenol showed fall in the level of GSH and increase in MDA level as well as fall in serum sodium and potassium level. Biochemical results were supported by histo-pathalogical changes. Pre-treatment with Vitamin C showed an rise in the level of GSH, sodium and potassium level and fall in MDA. Vitamin C pre-treatment also showed some beneficial changes in histology of kidney also. CONCLUSION: Our result demonstrated that exposure to Bisphenol induced oxidative stress in rat kidney and vitamin C could act as an antioxidant protecting against BPA induced oxidative stress.",

A potential solution to reduce this problem is the use of microbubbles. The interaction between microbubbles and ultrasound generates pores in the tumor cells, permitting enhanced drug uptake. This study investigates the delivery of the ascorbic acid derivative, palmitoyl ascorbate, to KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer cells in vitro. Ultrasound-triggered microbubbles enhanced the efficacy of liposomal palmitoyl ascorbate treatments by 1.7- and 2.2-fold in LS174T and HCT116 CRC cell lines, respectively. This enhancement was achieved without increasing the drug dosage, and the therapeutic effect was shown to be localized to the area that received the ultrasound pulse, aiding in the reduction of off-site toxicity."

This study aims to evaluate potential of vitamin C for treating trichinellosis-related pathological problems in the infected muscles of mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty CD1 male Albino mice were divided into three groups (10 mice per group). Negative and positive control groups (0.9% NaCl) and the infected vitamin C group (10 mg/kg body weight). Two weeks post-infection, each group was intraperitoneally injected daily for two weeks with Vitamin C or saline. The performance of the muscles was assessed both before and after the treatment. After dissection, constant parts of striated muscles were removed for further assays. The scoring of the histological changes of infected muscles was carried out. In addition to muscle malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were measured for the oxidative and antioxidant states. Creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase were also measured in tissues to reflect the degree of muscular damage. RESULTS: Vitamin C enhances the weakness of the muscular performance resulting from the infection. Vitamin C was able to repair some of the histological lesions that resulted from the infection. Trichinellosis caused severe changes in the biochemical markers in positive control animals. Muscle damage biomarkers and, besides, oxidative and antioxidant conditions were greatly ameliorated in infected vitamin C animals. Summing up, vitamin C can be used as a complementary drug due to its efficiency in improving pathogenesis following a trichinellosis infection. The supplement also must be tested in the intestinal stage of infection after showing promising results in the muscular stage.",

Research shows that vitamin C (VC) can inhibit ROS accumulation; however, its association with cochlear hair cell senescence remains elusive. METHODS AND RESULTS: Firstly, a cellular senescence model was established using D-galactose (D-gal) induced HEI-OC1 cells for 24 h. Senescent HEI-OC1 cells were then continued to be treated with the addition of VC or ROS inhibitor (N-acetylcysteine; NAC) for another 24 h, and explored the impact of VC on senescent cochlear hair cell and the potential regulatory mechanisms. The results indicated that D-gal-induced senescent HEI-OC1 cells, manifested as decreased cell viability, increased β-galactosidase activity and p21 protein level, and ROS and pro-inflammatory factors were upregulated, and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation was enhanced. However, the use of VC or NAC can significantly ameliorate these effects and improve HEI-OC1 cell senescence. CONCLUSIONS: This research indicates that VC can ameliorate D-gal-induced senescence of HEI-OC1 cochlear hair cells, and its protective effect may be related to the inhibition of the ROS/NF-κB pathway, which provides a new research direction for the prevention and treatment of ARHL.",

Multiple studies discussed the pathophysiological value of vitamin C to reserve endothelial functionality and improve microcirculatory flow in these patients. Nevertheless, most randomized clinical trials failed to show the clinical impact of adding vitamin C to sepsis and septic shock. Pneumonia is the most common infection to induce sepsis and septic shock, which could be an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Preliminary in-vitro data support the role of vitamin C in mitigating the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) development.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, the use of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has become increasingly common, leading to severe environmental pollution and harm to aquatic organisms. 17α-Methyltestosterone (MT) is a synthetic androgen that can cause immunotoxicity in aquaculture, affecting fish health. To address this issue, this study aimed to investigate the effect of Vitamin C (VC) on MT-induced immunotoxicity and determine the optimal VC supplementation. RESULTS: Carassius auratus was exposed to 50 ng/L MT and treated with 25, 50, and 150 mg/kg VC for 7, 14, and 21 d. Morphological indicators, histological characteristics, hepatic antioxidant capacity, and immune-related gene expression were analyzed. Additionally, RNA-seq was performed on the liver tissues of the control, MT, and MT + 25 mg/kg VC groups after 21 d. Results showed that, MT treatment significantly increased liver malondialdehyde content and inhibited immune-related gene expression (TNF-α, IL-8, INF-γ, IL-10, Caspase-9, and IGF-I), causing oxidative stress and immunotoxicity, leading to hepatic steatosis. However, supplementation with 25-50 mg/kg VC effectively alleviated the MT-induced damage to the hepatic structure and immune system. RNA-seq revealed significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in multiple signaling pathways, including the mTOR, MAPK, and Wnt pathways. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, 25-50 mg/kg VC alleviated inhibitory effect of MT on immune-related genes in C. auratus liver, reducing MT-induced tissue damage. VC not only alleviated inflammation, oxidative stress, and immunotoxicity induced by MT through the regulation of the mTOR, MAPK, and Wnt signaling pathways, but also indirectly enhanced cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms by regulating the NRF2 pathway. This provides a theoretical basis for VC application in aquaculture, improving fish health and increasing efficiency.",

METHOD: We conducted a single-center and retrospective study including patients with COVID-19 diagnosis who were hospitalized. Patients were categorized into three groups as those who received low-dose (LDVC group, 2 g/day, n = 183) or high-dose IV-VC (HDVC group, 25 g/day, n = 41) and who did not receive IV-VC (control group, n = 46). RESULTS: 270 patients aged 19-97 years were enrolled. The median length of stay (LOS) was significantly high (9 days) in patients treated with high-dose VC when compared to patients treated with low-dose VC and control patients (6 vs 5 days, respectively). Need for intensive care unit (ICU) transfer was found to be significantly low in patients treated with low-dose VC (25.7%); contrarily, control patients had significantly higher rates of ICU transfer (67.4%), when compared to patients treated with high-dose VC (39%). Mortality of the LDVC group was significantly lower than that of the HDVC group (11.5 vs 29.3%). However, mortality rates were similar between the control and HDVC groups (21.7 vs 29.3%). According to the multivariate stepwise logistic regression mortality analysis, percent of change (∆%)-BUN was the most significant variable (p < 0.001), the second significant variable was ∆%-AST (p = 0.002), the third significant variable was respiratory distress (p = 0.002), and the fourth significant variable was the IV-VC groups (p = 0.017). The mortality risk of those in the LDVC group was 10.2 times low compared to the control group. Similarly, the risk of mortality in the HDVC group was 6.5 times lower than that of the control group. CONCLUSION: Especially low and continious doses of IV-VC suggest fewer days of in-hospital LOS and survival benefit in hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis revealed that high-dose VC supplementation also had a mortality-reducing effect.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Vitamin C has been used as an essential antioxidant to reduce the inflammatory response associated with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but its effect on clinical outcomes remains controversial and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis and systematic review to assess the effects of vitamin C supplementation on the severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. DATA SOURCES: Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CNKI, CSTJ, Wan fang, and CBM databases were searched for publications between January 2020 and December 2023 that met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: The meta-analyses of outcomes in more than one study were performed using Review Manager software. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic. A randomized controlled trial, cohort studies, and retrospective studies in which vitamin C supplementation was supplemented as monotherapy or in combination, compared with placebo, no treatment, or other standard treatment without vitamin C were included. DATA ANALYSIS: After screening, 22 studies, with a total of 6831 patients, were selected for assessment. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models. The meta-analysis showed significant effects of vitamin C on alleviating clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.65-0.89, P = .0007) but no shortening of the length of hospitalization (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = -0.13-2.44, P = .08) compared with the control group. Notably, vitamin C supplements significantly reduced the mortality risk (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.51-0.80, P = .0001) and the incidence of severity (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.43-0.80, P = .0006) in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that vitamin C supplements may have a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes, as well as reducing severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, but more clinical randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the role of vitamin C in treating COVID-19.

      "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is the most prescribed drug for systemic treatment of psoriasis. However, its clinical use is limited by its nephrotoxicity, which antioxidants can attenuate. This study evaluates the impact of vitamin C (vitC), a well-known antioxidant, on nephrotoxicity induced by high MTX doses in the context of psoriasis. To achieve this purpose, the kidney injury triggered by acute MTX exposure was established in an imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse model. Mice were randomly divided into six groups: group 1 (control); group 2 (Imiquimod, IMQ), group 3 (IMQ+vitC 175 mg/kg/day); group 4 (MTX 20 mg/kg i.p); group 5 (IMQ+MTX 20 mg/kg) and group 6 (IMQ+MTX 20 mg/kg + vitC 175 mg/kg/day). The effects of these treatments were determined by considering the evolution of IMQ-induced skin lesions and serum creatinine levels. Moreover, histopathological analysis, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and TNF-α production were determined in kidney tissue. Results showed that vitC attenuates renal damage in the context of IMQ-induced psoriasis. However, the opposite occurs when administered with IMQ+MTX, worsening skin psoriasis lesions and exacerbating acute renal tubular necrosis and oxidative DNA damage. These results establish new clues about the MTX-induced nephrotoxicity in the psoriasis context and the putative protective effects of vitC. It suggests that vitC supplementation could help attenuate the renal damage promoted by the psoriatic pathological environment. However, it should be avoided in psoriasis patients with renal dysfunction treated with MTX."

Sixty-one percent of women in this stage require a primary therapeutic strategy to decrease OS. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of resveratrol and vitamin C on OS in postmenopausal women. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was carried out. Forty-six postmenopausal women with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR > 2.5) were included and divided into three treatment groups: group A: resveratrol, n = 13; group B: resveratrol + vitamin C, n = 15; and group C: vitamin C, n = 14. Between before and after the antioxidants, group B showed a decrease of 33% in lipohydroperoxides (p = 0.02), and malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased by 26% (p = 0.0007), 32% (p = 0.0001), and 38% (p = 0.0001) in groups A-C, respectively. For protein damage, group B is the most representative, with a decrease of 39% (p = 0.0001). For total antioxidant capacity (TAC), there were significant increases of 30% and 28% in groups B and C, respectively. For HOMA-IR, there were no significant differences among the study groups. Supplementation with this combination of antioxidants significantly decreases markers of OS in postmenopausal women. In addition, it increases TAC by up to 30%.",

As high-dose IVC has anticancer activity through peroxide (H2O2), it is hypothesized that IV ALA, a thiol antioxidant, might have untoward effects when combined with IVC. METHODS: In vitro combination index (CI) was investigated in 6 types of human cancer cells, using clinically relevant concentrations of Asc (0.625-20 mM) and ALA (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mM) evaluated by nonconstant ratio metrics. Cellular H2O2 was measured using HeLa cells expressing a fluorescent probe HyPer. Mouse xenografts of the metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 were treated with intraperitoneal injections of ALA (10, 20, and 50 mg/kg) and Asc (0.2, 0.5, and 4 g/kg) at various dose levels. RESULTS: Cancer cell lines were sensitive to Asc treatment but not to ALA. There is no evidence ALA becomes a prooxidant at higher doses. The CIs showed a mixture of synergistic and antagonistic effects with different ALA and Asc combination ratios, with a \"U\" shape response to Asc concentrations. The ALA concentrations did not influence the CIs or cellular H2O2 formation. Adding ALA to Asc dampened the increase of H2O2. Toxicity was observed in mice receiving prolonged treatment of ALA at all doses. The Asc at all doses was nontoxic. The combination of ALA and Asc increased toxicity. The ALA at all doses did not inhibit tumor growth. The Asc at 4 g/kg inhibited tumor growth. Adding ALA 50 mg/kg to Asc 4 g/kg did not enhance the effect, but lower doses of ALA (10 or 20 mg/kg) dampened the inhibitory effect of Asc. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support the concurrent or relative concurrent use of high-dose intravenous ALA with prooxidative high-dose IVC in clinical oncology care with potentially increased toxicity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adding vitamin C-rich fruit to staples containing iron could be an effective strategy to improve iron bioavailability and thereby reduce iron-deficiency anemia in children. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the effect of consuming a mungbean-based meal with or without guava fruit on body iron stores, hemoglobin concentration, and anemia of children as part of a school feeding program. METHODS: We conducted a 7-mo randomized, controlled trial with 6- to 10-y-old school children (n = 200; 46% anemic, 71% iron-deficient) from a rural community in Haryana, North India. Children were assigned to 2 treatment groups to daily receive either a meal of mungbean dal only (3.0 mg iron; vitamin C:iron molar ratio ∼0.5:1), or mungbean dal with fresh guava (3.2 mg iron; ∼170 mg vitamin C; molar ratio ∼18:1). Meals were served every school day under supervision. The primary outcome was body iron stores, whereas concentrations of hemoglobin and other iron indicators were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Daily consumption of mungbean dal along with guava did not result in an overall improvement of body iron stores [mean treatment effect: 0.65 mg/kg body weight; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.34, 1.63; P = 0.197]. However, compared with children who consumed mungbean dal only, children in the guava group showed a larger increase in hemoglobin concentration (3.7 g/L; 95% CI: 1.6, 5.6; P = 0.001), and a larger drop in the prevalence of anemia (-51%; 95% CIs: -74, -10; P = 0.022) and iron-deficiency anemia (-56%, 95% CI: -83, 13; P = 0.087). These effects were more pronounced in children who were iron deficient at study start. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of guava to a mungbean-based meal containing a moderate amount of iron increased hemoglobin and reduced anemia but did not provide enough additional absorbed iron to also increase body iron stores. Food-to-food fortification by inclusion of vitamin C-rich fruits in iron-containing school meals may help alleviate the burden of anemia in children.

METHODS: For this purpose, we performed behavioral tests, including open field test, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming test. In addition, we investigated the metabolism of serotonin, the level of inflammation, oxidative stress and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain cortex tissue of animals. RESULTS: Results indicated that CUMS exacerbates mood-related behaviors by affecting the brain oxidative stress balance, inflammatory response, and serotonin metabolism. Moreover, we found that CUMS-Vit C co-treatment could significantly reverse CUMS-induced complications by restoration of the mentioned biochemical parameters. DISCUSSION: Taken together, we would like to suggest the use of Vit C supplementation as a safe, inexpensive, and effective strategy for the management of CUMS.",

      "abstract": "Background: Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) is a severe complication arising from radiotherapy, particularly when treating abdominal malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma. The liver's critical role in systemic metabolism and its proximity to other abdominal organs make it highly susceptible to radiation-induced damage. This vulnerability significantly limits the maximum safe therapeutic dose of radiation, thereby constraining the overall efficacy of radiotherapy. Among the various modalities, electron beam therapy has gained attention due to its ability to precisely target tumors while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. However, despite its advantages, the long-term impacts of electron beam exposure on liver tissue remain inadequately understood, particularly concerning chronic injury and fibrosis driven by sustained oxidative stress. Objectives: to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the radioprotective effects of vitamin C in a model of radiation-induced liver disease. Methods: Male Wistar rats (n = 120) were randomly assigned to four groups: control, fractionated local electron irradiation (30 Gy), pre-treatment with vitamin C before irradiation, and vitamin C alone. The study evaluated the effects of electron beam radiation and vitamin C on liver tissue through a comprehensive approach, including biochemical analysis of serum enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin), cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α), and oxidative stress markers (MDA and SOD). Histological and morphometric analyses were conducted on liver tissue samples collected at 7, 30, 60, and 90 days, which involved standard staining techniques and advanced imaging, including light and electron microscopy. Gene expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 was analyzed using real-time PCR. Results: The present study demonstrated that fractional local electron irradiation led to significant reductions in body weight and liver mass, as well as marked increases in biochemical markers of liver damage (ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), and oxidative stress markers (MDA) in the irradiated group. These changes were accompanied by substantial histopathological alterations, including hepatocyte degeneration, fibrosis, and disrupted microvascular circulation. Pre-treatment with vitamin C partially mitigated these effects, reducing the severity of the liver damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation, and preserving a more favorable balance between hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Overall, the results highlight the potential protective role of vitamin C in reducing radiation-induced liver injury, although the long-term benefits require further investigation. Conclusions: The present study highlights vitamin C's potential as a radioprotective agent against electron beam-induced liver damage. It effectively reduced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, particularly in preventing the progression of radiation-induced liver fibrosis. These findings suggest that vitamin C could enhance radiotherapy outcomes by minimizing liver damage, warranting further exploration into its broader clinical applications."

      "abstract": "Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common endocrine malignancy, with an increased global incidence in recent decades, despite a substantially unchanged survival. While TC has an excellent overall prognosis, some types of TC are associated with worse patient outcomes, depending on the genetic setting. Furthermore, oxidative stress is related to more aggressive features of TC. Vitamin C, an essential nutrient provided with food or as a dietary supplement, is a well-known antioxidant and a scavenger of reactive oxygen species; however, at high doses, it can induce pro-oxidant effects, acting through multiple biological mechanisms that play a crucial role in killing cancer cells. Although experimental data and, less consistently, clinical studies, suggest the possibility of antineoplastic effects of vitamin C at pharmacological doses, the antitumor efficacy of this nutrient in TC remains at least partly unexplored. Therefore, this review discusses the current state of knowledge on the role of vitamin C, alone or in combination with other conventional therapies, in the management of TC, the mechanisms underlying this association, and the perspectives that may emerge in TC treatment strategies, and, also, in light of the development of novel functional foods useful to this extent, by implementing novel sensory analysis strategies."

There is no effective curative therapy available. However some studies have indicated that Vitamin C (VC) can reduce the incidence of CRPS-I. This study's objective is to investigate the effectiveness VC in preventing and treating CRPS-I. DESIGN: An Systematic review and Meta-analysis was done. DATA SOURCES: Primary research studies from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Embase database, and Cochran Library, and Google Scholar were reviewed. This search was conducted until March 27, 2024. This study was conducted without any language, place, and time restrictions. Study results were meta-analyzed with using effect sizes. To evaluate heterogeneity, we employed the Cochrane Q test and the I2 index. RESULTS: In our systematic review, 3947 articles were initially identified, with 3939 excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria, resulting in 8 studies being critically evaluated using Cochran's risk of bias checklist. The meta-analysis revealed that VC supplementation have effect on reducing CRPS-I post-limb surgery but this result shows that the pooled effect size is not statistically significant. The heterogeneity of the studies was low (I2 = 26.28%, p = 0.22). Publication bias was detected, indicating asymmetry in the funnel plot. CONCLUSION: The results of our study showed the positive effect of VC supplementation in reducing the prevalence of CRPS-I after limb surgery.",

The pro-myogenic effects of vitamin C have long been attributed to its role as a general antioxidant agent, as well as its role in collagen matrix synthesis and carnitine biosynthesis. Here, we show that vitamin C also functions as an epigenetic compound, facilitating chromatin landscape transitions during myogenesis through its activity as an enzymatic cofactor for histone H3 and DNA demethylation. Utilizing C2C12 myoblast cells to investigate the epigenetic effects of vitamin C on myogenesis, we observe that treatment of cells with vitamin C decreases global H3K9 methylation and increases 5-hmC levels. Furthermore, vitamin C treatment enhances myoblast marker gene expression and myotube formation during differentiation. We identify KDM7A as a histone lysine demethylase markedly upregulated during myogenesis. Accordingly, knockdown of Kdm7a prevents the pro-myogenic effects of vitamin C. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that KDM7A occupies the promoter region of the myogenic transcription factor MyoD1 where it facilitates histone demethylation. We also confirm that the methylcytosine dioxygenases TET1 and TET2 are required for myogenic differentiation and that their loss blunts stimulation of myogenesis by vitamin C. In conclusion, our data suggest that an epigenetic mode of action plays a major role in the myogenic effects of vitamin C.",

Group A was treated with normal saline, group B was injected with methotrexate 20mg/kg intraperitoneally, group C was pretreated with omega 3 100mg/kg, group D was pretreated with vitamin C 100mg/kg, and group E was pretreated with concomitant vitamin C and omega 3 100mg/kg. The intervention lasted 9 days in each group, and were injected with methotrexate on day 10. The mice were sacrificed under chloroform anaesthesia after 48 hours. Blood sample was taken for biochemical examination. One part of liver was preserved in formalin 10% for histopathological study. RESULTS: Of the 35 mice, there were 7(20%) in each of the 5 groups. There was a significant increase in malondialdehyde and lactate dehydrogenase levels and a decrease in the superoxide dismutase and glutathione (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with omega-3 and vitamin C ameliorated the hepatotoxicity induced by methotrexate due to strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) plays a vital role in human physiology, serving as both an antioxidant and a cofactor in enzymatic reactions. High-dose intravenous Vitamin C can achieve significantly elevated plasma concentrations, potentially enhancing its anticancer effects. This case study explores the synergistic impact of high-dose intravenous vitamin C in combination with bevacizumab and atezolizumab in the treatment of a patient with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old male was diagnosed with unresectable HCC, presenting with elevated liver enzymes and an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level of 2018 ng/mL. Initial treatment with atezolizumab and Bevacizumab commenced in February 2022. Although imaging indicated stable disease, AFP levels decreased modestly to 1,526 ng/mL, while liver function tests remained elevated, accompanied by further clinical deterioration and weight loss. Subsequently, intravenous vitamin C (30 grams) was introduced into the treatment regimen. This addition led to a rapid and significant reduction in AFP levels, normalization of liver function tests, and marked improvement in clinical symptoms. The patient continued on this combined regimen of vitamin c, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab. Four months later, CT scans revealed significant tumor shrinkage and necrosis. As of 30 months post-diagnosis, the patient remains on the regimen with normal liver function and an AFP level of 1.8 ng/mL, maintaining normal activities and stable weight. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of combining high-dose intravenous vitamin C with Bevacizumab and atezolizumab, which proved to be safe and resulted in significant clinical and radiological improvements in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Further studies are recommended to explore the potential of this combination therapy."

METHODS: Patients with advanced hematologic malignancies received IV vitamin C, 50 mg/kg/day, in three divided doses on days 1-14 after HSCT, followed by 500 mg bid oral until 6 months. RESULTS: All patients enrolled (55) were deficient in vitamin C at day 0 and had restoration to normal levels. Vitamin C recipients had a trend for lower nonrelapse mortality (NRM, 11% vs. 25%, p-value = 0.07) compared with propensity score-matched historical controls. A similar trend toward improved survival was observed (82% vs. 62% p = 0.06), with no attributable grade 3 and 4 toxicities to vitamin C. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, repletion of vitamin C is feasible and may reduce NRM and improve overall survival. Randomized trials in large uniform cohorts of patients are needed to confirm the utility of this easily available and inexpensive therapy."

      "abstract": "Vitamin C plays a significant role in various physiological functions. Humans depend on external sources of vitamin C due to the loss of the L-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase (GULO) gene that contributes to the synthesis of vitamin C. During the evolutionary loss of the GULO gene, physical, chemical, and biological factors were different from the present environmental settings. Besides the evolutionary genetic loss of the GULO gene, there is a gap in the insightful discussion on the potential implications of the non-functional GULO gene towards the predisposition of humans to cancer that faces hostile and carcinogenic environments. Various methods by which vitamin C modulates cellular processes related to cancer, including DNA repair, epigenetic changes, and redox balance, are discussed. Furthermore, we present experimental and clinical evidence indicating that vitamin C deficiency promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance, emphasizing its potential as a cancer phenotypic modulator. Therapeutic implications of restoring vitamin C levels in cancer treatment range from improving the efficacy of conventional medicines to exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities in tumors. The relevance of assessing vitamin C status in cancer patients and the basis for additional research into vitamin C supplementation as an adjuvant therapy is emphasized. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the implications associated with the functional deficiency of the GULO gene in human subjects exhibiting diverse tumor hallmarks, encompassing ECM remodeling, hypoxia, epigenetic reprogramming, oxidative stress, and drug responsiveness."

Hydrogels filled with bioactive substances used as a targeted healing system are worthy of attention. Vitamin C has healing and supporting effects in the treatment of many skin problems. The aim of the research was to produce a hydrogel biomaterial enriched with ascorbic acid for use as a dressing for difficult-to-heal wounds. A total of four different dressings were developed, each with different modifications in each layer. The dressing with vitamin C in the third layer was shown to release vitamin C ions more slowly than the dressing with vitamin C in the first layer. The studies conducted have shown that the dressings containing vitamin C have, among other things, a higher compressive strength, are characterised by a lower relative shortening after the application of force and shorten without damage at a lower force than in the case of a dressing without vitamin C. The dressings designed have a very good stability in the temperature range of 18 °C to 60 °C. It was found that the higher the vitamin C content in the dressing, the greater the increase in the specific heat value of the transformations. Therefore, hydrogel dressings containing vitamin C may be candidates for local delivery of vitamin C to the skin and protection of the wound area.",

The TET2 DNA dioxygenase gene is frequently mutated in hematopoietic malignancies and loss of TET enzymatic activity is found in a variety of solid tumors. We showed previously that vitamin C (VC), a cofactor of TET2, enhances tumor-associated T cell recruitment and checkpoint inhibitor therapy responses in a TET2-dependent manner. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis performed on B16-OVA melanoma tumors, we have shown here that an additional function for TET2 in tumors is to promote expression of certain antigen presentation machinery genes, which is potently enhanced by VC. Consistently, VC promoted antigen presentation in cell-based and tumor assays in a TET2-dependent manner. Quantifying intercellular signaling from the scRNA-seq dataset showed that T cell-derived IFN-γ-induced signaling within the tumor and tumor microenvironment requires tumor-associated TET2 expression, which is enhanced by VC treatment. Analysis of patient tumor samples indicated that TET activity directly correlates with antigen presentation gene expression and with patient outcomes. Our results demonstrate the importance of tumor-associated TET2 activity as a critical mediator of tumor immunity, which is augmented by high-dose VC therapy.",

Nowadays, combination therapies have shown promising results in reducing senescent cells. This study investigated the effects of vitamin C, doxycycline, and azithromycin co-treatment on the key cellular senescence-associated genes in ASCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human ASCs were cultured and treated for 24 hr with vitamin C, doxycycline, azithromycin, and a combination of three drugs. Total RNAs were extracted, and the expression of p21, p16, Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 genes was assessed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, cell cycle alterations were analyzed via flow cytometry after treatment with these compounds. RESULTS: Notably, vitamin C treatment resulted in a significant down-regulation of p21 gene expression (P<0.01), implicating the potential role of vitamin C in promoting cell cycle progression. Doxycycline treatment led to a significant up-regulation of p21 and p16 gene expression (P<0.05), as it has previously been shown to induce cell cycle arrest. Similarly, azithromycin treatment predominantly increased p21 expression (P<0.05). Besides, cell cycle analysis revealed that each compound had changed the distribution of cells across different phases of the cell cycle. CONCLUSION: The combined use of all three drugs yielded intricate interactions, suggesting a complex yet promising approach to future research. According to our findings, the major difference in the combination drug-treated group (VDA) can be explained by the neutralizing effect of these three components in the environment."

The percentage of improvement of Hemi-MASI score metformin group was 48.29%, While with vitamin C group was 37.19%. There was a significant improvement in dermoscopic findings in microneedling with topical metformin than with topical vitamin C group. Microneedling with topical metformin or topical vitamin C solution can be an effective and safe therapeutic option for treating melasma with no significant side effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The tobacco epidemic signifies a major public health threat. Nicotine (NIC), a major active constituent in tobacco, impedes male fertility and semen quality. This work is implemented to explore the potential of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) and the newly fabricated SeNPs @vitamin C (SeNPs@VITC) nanocomposite in mitigating testicular toxicity induced by NIC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The six groups of 48 adult Wistar rats were designed as follows: the control group injected intraperitoneally with normal saline, the SeNPs group treated orally with 2 mg/kg of SeNPs, the SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite group treated orally with 2 mg/kg of SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite, the NIC group injected intraperitoneally with 1.25 mL/kg of NIC, the NIC+ SeNPs group received SeNPs plus NIC, and the NIC+ SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite group received SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite plus NIC. Treatments were administered over a 28-day period. RESULTS: NIC treatment significantly caused poor sperm quality, decreased serum testosterone, increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations, reduced hemoglobin levels, leukocytosis, disrupted testicular oxidant/antioxidant balance, and disorganized testicular structure. The construction of the novel SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite, compared to NIC plus SeNPs alone, demonstrated a more potent ameliorative effect on NIC-induced reproductive toxicity in adult rats. The SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite significantly increased sperm count, reduced the percentage of sperm head abnormalities, lowered both serum FSH and LH concentrations, and improved the hemoglobin response. CONCLUSIONS: Both SeNPs and SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite alleviated the testicular toxicity induced by NIC, but the SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite exhibited superior efficacy. The SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite could be employed to advance enhanced therapeutic strategies for addressing male infertility."
