      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Objective biomarkers of diet, such as metabolomics, may improve dietary assessment and provide additional insight into how diet influences disease risk. The portfolio diet, a cholesterol-lowering plant-based diet, is recommended for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). This diet is low in saturated fat and includes nuts, plant protein (legumes), viscous fiber, and phytosterols. OBJECTIVE: We examined metabolomic profiles in response to the portfolio diet in two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where all foods were provided to the participants, compared to a control vegetarian diet and the same control diet with a statin. METHODS: The first RCT included 34 adults (age 58.4 ± 8.6 y) and the second RCT included 25 adults (age 61.0 ± 9.6 y), all with high LDL-C (>4.1 mmol/L). Plasma samples were obtained at baseline, week 2, and week 4 in both RCTs for metabolomics analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Linear mixed models were used to examine effects of the interventions on the metabolites in each RCT, applying a Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Of 496 known metabolites, 145 and 63 metabolites significantly changed within the portfolio diet interventions in the first and second RCT, respectively. The majority were glycerophosphocholines (32%), triacylglycerols (20%), glycerophosphoethanolamines (14%), sphingomyelins (8%), and amino acids and peptides (8%) in the first RCT, and glycerophosphocholines (48%), glycerophosphoethanolamines (17%), and amino acids and peptides (8%) in the second RCT. Fifty-two metabolites were consistently changed in the same direction with the portfolio diet intervention across both RCTs, after Bonferroni correction. CONCLUSIONS: Many of these metabolites likely reflect the plant-based nature, low saturated fat content, and cholesterol-lowering effects of the diet, such as increased N2-acetylornithine, L-pipecolic acid, lenticin, and decreased C18:0 lipids and cholesteryl esters. Further research is needed to validate these metabolites as biomarkers of a plant-based dietary pattern."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage may impact long-term outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. While bioactive compounds in plant foods have been linked to DNA protection, evidence among patients in remission remains limited. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of a one-year personalized intensive dietary intervention on DNA damage in post-surgery, non-metastatic CRC patients. Participants were enrolled 2-9 months after surgery in the ongoing randomized controlled trial, Norwegian dietary guidelines and colorectal cancer survival (CRC-NORDIET). Eligible participants (aged 50-80 years, primary stage I-III CRC) were randomized to either a plant-based dietary intervention targeting oxidative stress and inflammation, or to a control group that received standard dietary advice as a part of routine cancer care. As a secondary analysis, this study included 156 participants (78 in the intervention group and 78 in the control group) from the total 503 patients enrolled in CRC-NORDIET study. DNA damage in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) was assessed using the enzyme-modified comet assay during a 12-month follow-up period. A significant intervention effect on DNA base oxidation from baseline to 12 months was observed (P = 0.04), representing a 32 % reduction in the intervention group compared to the control group. No significant effect on DNA strand breaks was found. In conclusion, adherence to a plant-based dietary pattern may reduce DNA base oxidation in post-surgery CRC patients.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research suggests that eating a plant-dominant dietary pattern is beneficial to people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim was to investigate how increasing the diversity of plant food intake would impact metabolomic, microbiome and clinical parameters in people with CKD. METHODS: This study was a cross-over, randomized controlled trial involving 25 Australian adults diagnosed with stage 3-4 CKD. Participants were randomly allocated to follow two diets for 6 weeks each, separated by a minimum 4-week washout period: a high-diversity plant-based diet (HDPD, ≥30 unique plant foods weekly) and a low-diversity plant-based diet (LDPD, ≤15 unique plant foods weekly), alongside a usual kidney diet prescription. Data collection was completed at four timepoints (beginning and end of each intervention period). Primary outcome included a change in uremic toxins (indoxyl sulfate and p-Cresyl sulfate) concentrations. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included diet quality and nutritional status, fecal microbiome composition and diversity, plasma metabolome, symptom burden, quality of life scores, blood pressure, biochemical and anthropometric measures. RESULTS: Plasma and urinary uremic toxin levels did not consistently decrease across the cohort; however, significant reductions were observed in responders to the HDPD, particularly those with poorer kidney function and higher baseline uremic toxin levels. Neither diet caused electrolyte imbalances. The HDPD significantly improved diet quality, reduced potential renal acid load by an average of 47% from baseline, with an estimated marginal mean reduction of 9.96 (95% CI: -16.28 to -3.64), and compared to the LDPD, decreased total symptom burden, including constipation (95% CI: -4.11 to -0.54 and -0.91 to -0.22, respectively). It also shifted the gut microbiome toward increased production of beneficial metabolites like butyrate/isobutyrate. In contrast, the LDPD reduced microbial diversity and decreased the abundance of 27 species and 33 functional genes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the safety and clinically relevant therapeutic benefits of aiming to incorporate 30 or more unique plant foods weekly in the diet of individuals with moderate CKD. It was observed that individuals with more advanced kidney disease and higher levels of uremic toxins may derive the greatest benefit from adopting a HDPD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12619000442101."

      "abstract": "Selecting shrimp strains that perform well on a plant-based diet holds promise for solving the fishmeal (FM) shortage issue, with genetic improvement of feed efficiency (FE) being a key focus. This study compared a plant-based (fishmeal-free) diet with a 25% FM diet for the Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) to determine whether the FE-related traits, including residual feed intake (RFI), average daily weight gain (ADG), and daily feed intake (DFI), exhibit diet-specific genetic variations and genotype-by-diet (genotype × diet) interactions. Results showed that RFI was significantly higher under the plant-based diet treatment compared to the FM-based diet treatment (0.0049 g/d vs. -0.0045 g/d, p < 0.001), while ADG was notably lower (0.043 g/d vs. 0.110 g/d, p < 0.001), indicating that a plant-based diet may lead to reduced yields and impact the profitability of shrimp culture. In the case of being unable to estimate common environmental effects, the heritability estimates of RFI under the plant-based and FM-based diets were 0.743 ± 0.157 and 0.440 ± 0.125, respectively, and those of ADG and DFI ranged from 0.314 ± 0.121 to 0.947 ± 0.158. Genetic correlations between diets for RFI and DFI were 0.646 ± 0.162 and 0.549 ± 0.163, respectively, suggesting a degree of genotype × diet interactions. In contrast, the genetic correlation between diets for ADG was only 0.296 ± 0.259, indicating a strong genotype × diet interaction. These findings highlight the importance of considering selective breeding for improved feed efficiency in a plant-based diet environment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Plant-based diets (PBD) are generally promoted as beneficial for health. However, whether this is also the case at older ages, when energy deficits, muscle loss and frailty affect health, is unclear. Research has shown that among older adults, particularly in men, a healthful PBD is associated with a lower frailty risk. This relation was however, not studied in the context of socio-economic status (SES), a major factor influencing the risk of frailty. Therefore, we aim to assess whether plant-based diets associate with frailty risk at older ages and whether this association is moderated by sex and income in a large population-based dataset. METHODS: We investigated baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort study (UKB) cross-sectionally (n = 73 180, mean age = 55.48 ± 7.87). We applied a plant-based diet index [range 17-85], differentiating between a healthful (hPDI) and unhealthful plant-based diet (uPDI). Frailty was assessed by the Fried frailty phenotype and categorized into 0-4 symptoms of frailty. Average annual household income was divided into three categories: low (<18.000 £), medium (18.000-52.000 £) and high (>52.000 £). We applied an ordinal logistic regression model with frailty as the categorical outcome and PDI as continuous predictor while adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education, BMI and UKB assessment center. Secondly, we included an interaction term (PDI*sex*income). To identify subgroups driving any interactions, we stratified by sex and subsequently by income group to determine the effect of PDI in subgroups while additionally adjusting for lifestyle factors. RESULTS: A 10-unit increase in hPDI was associated with 3.4% lower odds for frailty (OR = 0.966, 95%CI [0.946, 0.987]), whereas a 10-unit increase in uPDI was associated with 7.7% greater odds for frailty (OR = 1.077, 95%CI [1.054, 1.101]). The association between uPDI and frailty was moderated by income and sex (uPDI*income*sex, p = 0.002), whereas no such moderation was found for hPDI (p = 0.602). Subsequent stratification reveals a significant effect of uPDI on frailty particularly among men with low income (OR = 1.177, 95% CI [1.069, 1.298]), but not for women. This association in men largely persisted after adjustment for additional lifestyle factors (OR = 1.119, 95%CI [0.995, 1.258]). CONCLUSION: We observed that adherence to an unhealthful plant-based diet was associated with a higher risk for frailty. This relation was especially observed for men with lower incomes and not explained by other lifestyle factors. While future research may investigate more specific determinants of health and diet behavior in men of low household income, this group in particular may profit from diet intervention improving diet quality.",

We studied the changes in cardiovascular risk factors with a lifestyle intervention in this population. We retrospectively analyzed data from 67 participants (mean age 69.2 (SD 7.9) years; 97% male) with atherosclerotic heart disease and/or type 2 diabetes in a 15-week, multiple health behavior change (MHBC) intervention implemented in a Veterans Affairs (VA) Behavioral Medicine Clinic. The intervention promoted a whole foods, plant-based (WFPB) diet, physical activity, and cognitive-behavioral stress management. We assessed cardiometabolic risk factors at baseline, 1 month into the intervention, and at 15 weeks (post-treatment). Among intervention completers (n = 67), we observed statistically significant improvements in waist circumference (-2.8 inches, P = .03), systolic blood pressure (-7.9 mmHg, P = .03), LDL cholesterol (-11.27 mg/dL, P = .04), fasting glucose (-15.10 mg/dL, P = .03), and hemoglobin A1c (-0.55%, P = .017) at post-treatment. Participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 34) achieved improvements in hemoglobin A1c (-0.80%, P = .007), systolic blood pressure (-10.98 mmHg, P = .01), and diastolic blood pressure (-6.65 mmHg, P = .03) at post-treatment. Medication usage did not significantly change. Veterans who completed the MHBC intervention achieved significant improvements in cardiometabolic risk in a routine VA clinical practice setting."

      "abstract": "Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a major contributor of premature cardiovascular-related deaths. Patients are typically on numerous medications to manage this condition; however, patients continue to experience poor quality of life. Alternative therapeutic approaches are needed to treat HFrEF. The clinical course of seven patients with Stage C and D HFrEF who failed guideline-directed medical therapy were retrospectively analyzed based on medical chart data. All patients consumed a defined, plant-based diet as part of their clinical treatment, and a subset also underwent alternative treatment modalities: External Counterpulsation therapy, BEMER therapy, infrared sauna therapy, ozone therapy, or PlaqueX® therapy. Chart review of these patients indicated improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP). All patients also had a significant reduction in medication needs and body weight. Further, all patients reported significant improvements in their quality of life. These data suggest that a defined, plant-based diet combined with other alternative modalities may be efficacious in reducing HFrEF medications and treating Stage C or D HFrEF patients who failed guideline-direct medical therapies. Observations from this case series indicate a need for rigorous prospective studies to confirm these effects."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of a plant-based diet (PBD) on gut microbiota composition and inflammation in CD patients and assess the utility of trnL gene sequencing for monitoring dietary adherence. METHODS: Fourteen CD patients participated in a 12-week PBD intervention. Dietary adherence was monitored through self-reported food diaries and trnL sequencing, which detects plant residues in fecal samples. Gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, and fecal calprotectin levels were measured as an indicator of intestinal inflammation. RESULTS: TrnL sequencing identified 55 plant genera in fecal samples, compared to 41 reported in food diaries, highlighting its accuracy in assessing plant residue diversity. By week 4, participants demonstrated a 1.4-fold increase in plant intake, correlating with a significant increase in microbial diversity. Key genera associated with gut health, such as Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides, increased in abundance. Additionally, fecal calprotectin levels decreased from 472 mg/kg at baseline to 207 mg/kg at week 12, indicating reduced intestinal inflammation. DISCUSSION: A PBD positively influenced gut microbiota composition and decreased intestinal inflammation in CD patients. The study also demonstrated that trnL sequencing is an effective tool for assessing dietary adherence in clinical settings, offering a more objective measure than self-reported food diaries."

This diet has been reported to cause changes in microbial composition, concentration levels of glycemic parameters, and immune cells or inflammatory cytokines. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of prebiotics, as well as Mediterranean and plant-based dietary interventions, on gut microbiota composition and glucose homeostasis in individuals with PD or T2D. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was developed according to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines and checklist. PubMed, EBSCOhost and Google Scholar were the three databases that were used to search for electronically published studies. Data extraction was conducted and examined by the reviewers and all the eligible studies were selected. To test for the quality and biases of the included studies, the Downs and Black checklist was used, followed by the use of Review Manager 5.4. A forest plot was used for meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis. The strength of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Overall, eight studies met the inclusion criteria: seven focused on patients with T2D, and one focused on patients with PD. The prebiotic dietary intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on glycemic control, including fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). However, one study investigating the Mediterranean diet reported a significant effect on glycemic control. Both prebiotic and Mediterranean dietary interventions were found to beneficially influence gut microbial composition in the intervention groups compared to the placebo groups. No studies assessed the impact of a plant-based diet on microbial composition and glucose parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicated that dietary intervention with a prebiotic or Mediterranean diet shows to beneficially improve the gut microbiota composition of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacteria in patients with PD or T2D. However, their beneficial effects on FBG and HbA1c were less clear and uncertain due to limited reports, particularly regarding the Mediterranean dietary intervention.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 participants from a randomized clinical trial received additional periodontal assessment. The intervention group (n = 17) followed a WPBD for 16 weeks, whereas the control group (CG) (n = 19) was instructed not to change their diet. Measurements were assessed at baseline (t1), week 8 (t2) and week 16 (t3). Periodontal examination included bleeding on probing (BOP), periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) and plaque index (PI) on six index teeth, salivary pH and matrix-matalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8). RESULTS: At t3, the mean PISA of the index teeth was reduced by 32 mm2 (53.8) in the WPBD group and increased by 22.6 mm2 (45.1) in the CG group (intra-group p = 0.255 and p = 0.977, respectively), BOP changes were similar (intra-group p = 0.89 and p = 0.839, respectively). MMP-8 values reduced in the WPBD group by 50.73 ng/mL (117) and in the CG by 5.40 ng/mL (96.6) (intra-group p = 0.066, p = 0.837, respectively). Difference in change (t3 - t1) between the groups was p = 0.001, p = 0.003 and p = 0.032, respectively. Saliva pH increased in the WPBD group only (intra-group p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: A trend towards stabilization of the inflammatory parameters (BOP, PISA) was observed in the WPBD group. Because of the non-significant changes within the groups, this study highlights the imperative for future studies. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03901183.",

This study aimed to examine associations between healthful and unhealthful plant-based dietary patterns with risk of all-cause mortality among CKD patients for the first time. METHODS: This prospective analysis included 4807 UK Biobank participants with CKD at baseline. We examined associations of adherence to both the healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI), calculated from repeated 24-h dietary assessments, with risk of all-cause mortality using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: Over a 10-year follow-up, 675 deaths were recorded. Participants with the highest hPDI scores showed a 34% lower risk of mortality [HRQ4vsQ1 (95% CI): 0.66 (0.52-0.83), ptrend <0.001]. Those with the highest uPDI scores had a 52% [1.52 (1.20-1.93), ptrend = 0.002] higher risk of mortality compared to participants with the lowest respective scores. In food group-specific analyses, higher wholegrain intakes were associated with a 29% lower mortality risk, while intakes of refined grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages were associated a 30% and 34% higher risk, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In CKD patients, a higher intake of healthy plant-based foods was associated with a lower risk of mortality, while a higher intake of less healthy plant-based foods was associated with a higher risk of mortality. These results underscore the importance of plant food quality and support the potential role of healthy plant food consumption in the treatment and management of CKD to mitigate unfavourable outcomes.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of a plant-based diet intervention. Secondly, the purpose was to investigate whether such diet may reduce disease activity and enhance quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a single arm feasibility study. Outpatients with Crohn's disease in biological therapy were guided over twelve weeks towards a dietary lifestyle change. OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility concerning recruitment, retention rate and compliance. Secondary outcomes were measures of patient reported outcome questionnaires (PROMS). Paired t-tests were used to examine changes in CO2 emissions, anthropology, biomarkers, and patient-reported data. Δ-values were used to investigate difference between dietary intake and requirements. Linear regression analyses examined the association between biomarkers and PROMS. RESULTS: In total, 15 participants completed the intervention with easy recruitment and a retention rate at 87.6%. A clinically positive tendency was seen towards improved symptom scores for disease (HBI; p=0.028 and IBDQ; p=0.006) but not for fatigue (IBD-F; p = 0.097), although none of these were statistically significant. Adverse effects were decreased protein intake (p=0.069) and slightly reduced muscle mass. It remains unclear to what extent the intervention contributed to the improved self-reported effects although perception of disease activity was improved. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that it is possible to retain patients following a plant-based diet. However, the dietary change required ongoing dietetic support with a focus on anti-inflammatory agents and the still unattainable protein requirements.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A plant-based diet is associated with better survival among patients with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), but its association in metastatic CRC is unknown. METHODS: Using an National Cancer Institute-sponsored trial (CALGB/SWOG 80405), we included 1284 patients who completed validated food frequency questionnaires at the initiation of metastatic CRC treatment. We calculated 3 indices: overall plant-based diet index (PDI), which emphasized consumption of all plant foods while reducing animal food intake; healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), which emphasized consumption of healthful plant foods such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI), which emphasized consumption of less healthful plant foods such as fruit juices, refined grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages. We estimated the associations of 3 indices (quintiles) with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: We observed 1100 deaths and 1204 progression events (median follow-up = 6.1 years). Compared with the lowest quintile, patients in the highest quintile of PDI had significantly better survival (hazard ratio [HR] for OS = 0.76 [0.62-0.94], Ptrend = .004; PFS = 0.81 [0.66-0.99], Ptrend = .09). Similar findings were observed for hPDI (HR for OS = 0.81 [0.65-1.01], Ptrend = .053; PFS = 0.80 [0.65-0.98], Ptrend = .04), whereas uPDI was not associated with worse survival (HR for OS = 1.16 [0.94-1.43], Ptrend = .21; PFS = 1.12 [0.92-1.36], Ptrend = .42). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a plant-based diet, especially when rich in healthful plant foods, is associated with better survival among patients with metastatic CRC. The cause of survival benefits warrants further investigation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plant-based diets (PBD) may induce hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. OBJECTIVES: We explored the safety and feasibility of PBD in hyperkalemic CKD patients receiving the potassium binder sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC). METHODS: In the current 6-wk trial, 26 hyperkalemic patients with CKD stage 4-5 not on dialysis received a low-protein low-potassium diet plus SZC for 3 wk and then a PBD with high potassium content delivered as a weekly food basket while continuing SZC for subsequent 3 wk. Plasma potassium was monitored weekly and SZC was titrated to achieve normokalemia. The 24-h urine excretion of potassium and sodium, 24-h food records, dietary quality, nutritional status, Bristol stool scale, Quality of life (QoL), and renal treatment satisfaction were assessed at baseline (week 0), week 3, and week 6. RESULTS: Mean plasma potassium decreased from 5.5 to 4.4 mEq/L within 48-72 h after baseline, then rose to 4.7-5.0 mEq/L throughout the remaining study period following dose adjustments of SZC that matched the increased potassium intake of PBD from week 3 to week 6. Over the study period, 24-h urinary potassium excretion decreased from week 0 to week 3 and increased from week 3 to week 6. During the study, 58% of patients had fasting plasma potassium between 3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L and there was no episode of plasma potassium >6.5 mEq/L or <3.0 mEq/L during the study. P-carbon dioxide increased from baseline until week 6 (21 ± 2 to 23 ± 2 mEq/L; P = 0.002; mean ± SD), whereas remaining laboratory values remained unchanged. Fiber intake, dietary quality, the domain physical functioning from QoL, and 1 question of renal treatment satisfaction improved, whereas stool type and frequency did not change after starting PBD. CONCLUSIONS: PBD in hyperkalemia-prone CKD patients receiving SZC improved dietary quality and increased the intake of healthy foods, whereas plasma potassium concentration remained stable within normal values for most patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This trial was registered at the https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04207203 as NCT04207203.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to explore the effects of supplementing cholesterol in plant-based feed on intestinal barriers (including physical barrier, chemical barrier, immune barrier, biological barrier) of GIFT strain tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Four isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were prepared as follows: plant-based protein diet (Con group) containing corn protein powder, soybean meal, cottonseed meal, and rapeseed meal, with the addition of cholesterol at a level of 0.6 % (C0.6 % group), 1.2 % (C1.2 % group), and 1.8 % (C1.8 % group), respectively. A total of 360 fish (mean initial weight of (6.08 ± 0.12) g) were divided into 12 tanks with 30 fish per tank, each treatment was set with three tanks and the feeding period lasted 9 weeks. Histological analysis revealed that both the C0.6 % and C1.2 % groups exhibited a more organized intestinal structure, with significantly increased muscle layer thickness compared to the Con group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in the C1.2 % group, there was a significant up-regulation of tight junction-related genes (claudin-14, occludin, zo-1) compared to the Con group (P < 0.05). 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining results also demonstrated a notable enhancement in intestinal cell proliferation within the C1.2 % group (P < 0.05). Regarding the intestinal chemical barrier, trypsin and lipase activities were significantly elevated in the C1.2 % group (P < 0.05), while hepcidin gene expression was considerably down-regulated in this group but up-regulated in the C1.8 % group (P < 0.05). In terms of the intestinal immune barrier, inflammation-related gene expression levels (tnf-α, il-1β, caspase 9, ire1, perk, atf6) were markedly reduced in the C1.2 % group (P < 0.05). Regarding the intestinal biological barrier, the composition of the intestinal microbiota indicated that compared to the Con group, both the 0.6 % and 1.2 % groups showed a significant increase in Shannon index (P < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant increase in the abundance of Firmicutes and Clostridium in the C1.2 % group (P < 0.05). In summary, supplementation of 1.2 % cholesterol in the plant-based diet exhibits the potential to enhance intestinal tight junction function and improve the composition of intestinal microbiota, thereby significantly promoting tilapia's intestinal health.",

Novel insight on health outcomes in dogs consuming K9PBN is of relevance to veterinary professionals and consumers given a growing interest in non-traditional dog foods with perceived health benefits, while considering potential safety concerns. We aimed to investigate nutritional equivalence by measuring clinical health outcomes in adult dogs fed K9PBN over twelve months compared to a meat-based diet at baseline. We enrolled fifteen clinically healthy adult dogs living in households in Los Angeles County, California in a prospective cohort study and evaluated clinical, hematological, and nutritional parameters in dogs at 0, 6, and 12 months, including complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry, cardiac biomarkers, plasma amino acids, and serum vitamin concentrations. The study found that clinically healthy, client-owned, adult dogs maintain health, based on physical exams, complete blood count, serum chemistry, plasma amino acids, serum vitamins, and cardiac biomarkers combined with client-reported observations, when fed commercial K9PBN over a twelve-month period. This study is the most comprehensive and longest known K9PBN investigation to date and provides clinically relevant evidence-based nutrition data and new knowledge on outcomes in clinically healthy dogs who thrive without consumption of animal-derived ingredients. These results also provide a valuable foundation for the future study of K9PBN as a potential nutritional intervention for clinically relevant pathologies in canine medicine. Lastly, it is of major relevance to One Health paradigms since ingredients produced independent of industrial food animal production are both more sustainable and help to circumvent ethical dilemmas for maintenance of health in domestic dogs.",

Dietary intakes of the patients were evaluated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Then, PDI was compared between patients who needed to be hospitalised (considered severe cases), and those who got treatment at home (considered non-severe cases). After adjustment for confounders including age, sex, energy intake and body mass index, lower odds of hospitalisation were found for participants having a greater score of overall PDI (OR per 10 units increase: 0.42; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.80) and healthy PDI (OR per 10 unit increase: 0.45; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78). In conclusion, our data presented that there is a relation between PDI and lower risk of hospitalisation in COVID-19 patients, possibly through boosting the immune function."

Within WFPB diets, the intakes of isoflavones, omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs), and omega-3 polyunsaturated FAs (n-3 PUFAs), which have been discussed in reference to breast cancer outcomes, have not been well characterized. METHODS: Women with stage IV breast cancer on stable therapy were randomized 2:1 into (1) a WFPB intervention (N = 21) or (2) usual care (N = 11) for 8 weeks. Three meals per day were provided. Outcomes presented here include dietary intake of isoflavones, n-3 and n-6- PUFAs, which were assessed using three-day food records at baseline and 8 weeks. Baseline and 8-week mean intake within groups were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and between control and intervention groups by a two-sample t-test. RESULTS: The WFPB intervention participants increased their daily consumption of total isoflavones from a mean of 0.8 mg/day to 14.5 mg/day (p < 0.0001) and decreased the n-6:n-3 ratio of their diet from a mean of 9.3 to 3.7 (p < 0.0001). Within the WFPB group, linoleic acid (n-6 PUFA) consumption decreased by a mean of 3.8 g (p = 0.0095), from 12.8 g/day to 9.0 g/day; total n-3 PUFA consumption increased by a mean of 1.1 g (p = 0.0005), from 1.6 g/day to 2.7 g/day. CONCLUSION: Transitioning to a WFPB diet resulted in significantly increased isoflavone intake and decreased n-6:n-3 ratio in women with breast cancer."

This review synthesises the evidence on the barriers adults aged 18 to 65 living in high-income countries (HIC) may experience when adopting a PBD. A systematic literature review was conducted using four search databases: Medline, Embase, Global Health, and Web of Science. Barriers were mapped to behaviour change strategies using the COM-B model. Ten studies were included in the final review, including 1740 participants. Five were qualitative, four were cross-sectional, and one was a pre- and-post-intervention study. In total, 40 barriers were identified and synthesised into 11 themes: financial, lack of knowledge, emotional, health, convenience, social, enjoyment of meat, environmental, accessibility, personal ability, and media. Of the 40 barriers, nutritional intake/requirements (categorised into the \"health\" theme) had the most evidence. This barrier encompassed concerns around being able to meet nutritional needs if an individual were to adopt a PBD. Habits (in the \"personal ability\" theme), which included established eating habits and habitual behaviours relating to animal-source foods, had the second most evidence alongside the barrier of not knowing what to eat as part of a PBD (in the \"lack of knowledge\" theme). Education interventions and communication/marketing policies were the behaviour change mechanisms mapped onto these barriers. Future interventions should focus on informing individuals about what to consume as part of a nutritionally balanced PBD and facilitating habitual dietary change.",

However, less is known regarding the impact of plant-based diets on quality of life among individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer. The authors' objective was to examine the relationship between plant-based diet indices postdiagnosis with quality of life. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 3505 participants in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2016) with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Food-frequency questionnaires were used to calculate overall and healthful plant-based diet indices. Quality-of-life scores were calculated using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine associations over time between plant-based diet indices and quality-of-life domains (sexual functioning, urinary irritation/obstruction, urinary incontinence, bowel functioning, hormonal/vitality), adjusted for demographics, oncologic history, body mass index, caloric intake, health-related behaviors, and comorbidities. RESULTS: The median age at prostate cancer diagnosis was 68 years; 48% of patients underwent radical prostatectomy, and 35% received radiation as primary therapy. The median time from diagnosis/treatment to first the quality-of-life questionnaire was 7.0 years. A higher plant-based diet index was associated with better scores for sexual function, urinary irritation/obstruction, urinary incontinence, and hormonal/vitality. Consuming more healthful plant-based foods was also associated with better sexual and bowel function, as well as urinary incontinence and hormonal/vitality scores in the age-adjusted analysis, but not in the multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study provides supportive evidence that greater consumption of healthful plant-based foods is associated with modestly higher scores in quality-of-life domains among patients with prostate cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Americans consume diets that fall short of dietary recommendations, and the cost of healthier diets is often cited as a barrier to dietary change. We conducted a nonrandomized crossover trial with meals provided utilizing 2 diets: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and whole food, plant-based (WFPB), and thus had intake data from baseline and both intervention diets. OBJECTIVES: Using actual diet records, describe food costs of baseline diets of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as well as therapeutic DASH and WFPB diets. METHODS: Three-day food records were collected and analyzed for each 7-d diet phase: baseline, DASH, and WFPB. Nutrient content was analyzed using the Nutrient Data System for Research and cost was determined using Fillet, an application to manage menu pricing. Food costs were calculated for each diet as consumed and adjusted to a standardized 1800 kcal/d. Ingredient-only costs of food away from home (FAFH) were approximated and analyzed. Costs were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models as a function of diet. RESULTS: Fifteen subjects enrolled; 12 completed all dietary phases. The baseline, DASH, and WFPB diets, as consumed, cost $15.72/d (95% CI; $13.91, $17.53), $12.74/d ($11.23, $14.25), and $9.78/d ($7.97, $11.59), respectively. When adjusted to an 1800 kcal/d intake, the baseline, DASH, and WFPB diets cost $15.69/d ($13.87, $17.52), $14.92/d ($13.59, $16.26), and $11.96/d ($10.14, $13.78), respectively. When approximated ingredient-only costs of FAFH were analyzed, as consumed baseline [$11.01 ($9.53, $12.49)] and DASH diets [$11.81 ($10.44, $13.18)] had similar costs; WFPB diet [$8.83 ($7.35, $10.31)] cost the least. CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study with meals provided, the food costs of plant-predominant diets offering substantial metabolic health benefits were less than or similar to baseline food costs of adults with insulin-treated T2DM. Longer-term data without meal provision are needed for more generalizable results. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04048642.",

These tools support identifying and addressing barriers to healthy eating, reducing body mass index (BMI), and building increased physical resilience in real time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a 12-week learning management system designed to combine nutritional intervention with education and coaching on improving emotional intelligence (EI) could alter cardiometabolic outcomes. METHODS: This pre-post prospective study enrolled 37 adult volunteers with BMI greater than 25 to participate in a 12-week learning management system. Primary (BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein, and fasting glucose levels) and secondary self-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months after enrollment using Short Form-36, Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQi), and Whole Health Index (WHI). Linear mixed-effects regression models with random effect were used to estimate changes in primary and secondary outcomes. We adjusted for multiple testing using Holm step-down method. RESULTS: BMI and LDL were the only primary endpoints lower at program completion and 6-month follow-up compared to baseline levels (-1.63 and -17.77 mg/dL, respectively; P < .001). Secondary outcomes showing statistically significant improvement from baseline to 6-month follow-up included energy/fatigue (Short Form-36), self-regard (EQi), decision-making (EQi), impulse control (EQi), stress management (EQi), Whole Brain - Form A (WHI), Whole Food - Form C (WHI), and Whole Body - Form D (WHI). CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that lifestyle programs combining nutritional interventions and EI can have a significant impact on BMI and LDL. Our study highlights the potential importance of both nutrition and EI in programs targeting diet and lifestyle modification."

      "abstract": "Identification and recognition of the ubiquitous environmental factor are prerequisite for treatment and prevention of the disease. The biggest problem with current practice in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the lack of a widely appreciated ubiquitous environmental factor for the disease. The incidence of IBD is associated with dietary transition from a traditional diet to the current (westernized) diet. Prospective cohort studies and case-control studies indicate that the current diet is a risk factor for IBD. The current diet tends to cause gut microbial dysbiosis resulting in a pro-inflammatory state. Therefore, we regard our current diet as this factor. Even nutritionally balanced meals are unable to suppress relapse, particularly in Crohn's disease (CD). Therefore, we developed a plant-based diet (PBD) (lacto-ovo-semi-vegetarian diet) to counter the current diet. By incorporating the PBD into practice, we achieved far better outcomes in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and CD in both the induction and quiescent phases compared to the current standard therapy. All patients were treated on an inpatient basis and provided with a PBD. CD is far more untenable than UC and is destined to follow a disabling course. Therefore, infliximab was indicated in all patients with CD, but only in severe cases with UC. This infliximab and PBD as first-line (IPF) therapy broke the barrier of primary nonresponders to biologics (around 30%): the remission rate was 96% (44/46) in CD and 76% (13/17) in severe UC. A PBD can induce remission without medication in approximately one-third of mild cases of UC. All patients were advised to adhere PBD after discharge. In CD, a relapse-free outcome was achieved in nearly a half of patients (52%) at 10-year follow-up without biologics or immunosuppressants. Cumulative relapse rates for 51 initial episode cases of UC (18 mild, 30 moderate, 3 severe) at 1 and 5 years were 14% and 27%, respectively. We believe our assertion that the current diet is the ubiquitous environmental factor underlying IBD is correct and a PBD is right diet for the disease."

We conducted a nonrandomized crossover trial utilizing two plant-based diets (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH, and Whole Food, Plant-Based, or WFPB) to assess acute changes in insulin requirements and associated markers among individuals with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Participants (n = 15) enrolled in a 4-week trial with sequential, one-week phases: Baseline, DASH 1, WFPB, and DASH 2. Each diet was ad libitum and meals were provided. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, daily insulin usage was 24%, 39%, and 30% lower after DASH 1, WFPB, and DASH 2 weeks respectively (all p < 0.01). Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 49% lower (p < 0.01) and the insulin sensitivity index was 38% higher (p < 0.01) at the end of the WFPB week before regressing toward baseline during DASH 2. Total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, leptin, urinary glucose, and hsCRP decreased to a nadir at the end of the WFPB week before increasing during DASH 2. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a DASH or WFPB diet can result in significant, rapid changes in insulin requirements, insulin sensitivity, and related markers among individuals with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, with larger dietary changes producing larger benefits.",

A dietary score to assess adherence to a healthy plant-based diet is the healthful plant-based diet index. While there is evidence from cohort studies that an increased healthful plant-based diet index is associated with improved risk markers, evidence from intervention studies is still lacking. METHODS: A lifestyle intervention was conducted with mostly middle-aged and elderly participants from the general population (n = 115). The intervention consisted of a 16-month lifestyle program focusing on a healthy plant-based diet, physical activity, stress management, and community support. RESULTS: After 10 weeks, significant improvements were seen in dietary quality, body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, total cholesterol, measured and calculated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, oxidized LDL particles, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, and pulse pressure. After 16 months, significant decreases were seen in body weight (-1.8 kg), body mass index (-0.6 kg/m2), and measured LDL cholesterol (-12 mg/dl). Increases in the healthful plant-based diet index were associated with risk marker improvements. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendation of moving toward a plant-based diet appears acceptable and actionable and may improve body weight. The healthful plant-based diet index can be a useful parameter for intervention studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota has emerged as a potential therapeutic target to improve the management of obesity and its comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the impact of a high fiber (∼38 g/d) plant-based diet, consumed ad libitum, with or without added inulin-type fructans (ITF), on the gut microbiota composition and cardiometabolic outcomes in subjects with obesity. We also tested if baseline Prevotella/Bacteroides (P/B) ratio predicts weight loss outcomes. METHODS: This is a secondary exploratory analysis from the PREVENTOMICS study, in which 100 subjects (82 completers) aged 18-65 years with body mass index 27-40 kg/m2 were randomized to 10 weeks of double-blinded treatment with a personalized or a generic plant-based diet. Changes from baseline to end-of-trial in gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing), body composition, cardiometabolic health and inflammatory markers were evaluated in the whole cohort (n = 82), and also compared in the subgroup of subjects who were supplemented with an additional 20 g/d ITF-prebiotics (n = 21) or their controls (n = 22). RESULTS: In response to the plant-based diet, all subjects lost weight (-3.2 [95% CI -3.9, -2.5] kg) and experienced significant improvements in body composition and cardiometabolic health indices. Addition of ITF to the plant-based diet reduced microbial diversity (Shannon index) and selectively increased Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium (q < 0.05). The change in the latter was significantly associated with higher values of insulin and HOMA-IR and lower HDL cholesterol. In addition, the LDL:HDL ratio and the concentrations of IL-10, MCP-1 and TNFα were significantly elevated in the ITF-subgroup. There was no relationship between baseline P/B ratio and changes in body weight (r = -0.07, p = 0.53). CONCLUSION: A plant-based diet consumed ad libitum modestly decreases body weight and has multiple health benefits in individuals with obesity. Addition of ITF-prebiotics on top this naturally fiber-rich background selectively changes gut microbiota composition and attenuates some of the realized cardiometabolic benefits.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Farmers in Indonesia have a high risk for hypertension owing to their lifestyle and working environment. Diet management is a solution to reduce hypertension, and Indonesia has natural resources in the agricultural sector that could help manage hypertension. Optimizing vegetable and fruit intake in a plant-based diet (PBD) could help maintain blood pressure among farmers in Indonesia. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the health problem of hypertension and the characteristics of local food sources to formulate a PBD menu for treating hypertension, as well as assess the prevalence of hypertension, level of acceptability of a PBD, and associated sociodemographic factors. Further, we want to examine the effectiveness of a community-based nursing program for managing hypertension using a PBD. METHODS: We will use the exploratory sequential mixed methods approach. There will be a qualitative study (phase I) in 2022 and a quantitative study (phase II) in 2023. We will analyze data using a thematic framework in phase I. In phase II, the study will involve (1) questionnaire development and validation; (2) examination of the prevalence of hypertension, the level of acceptability of a PBD, and the associated factors; and (3) a randomized controlled trial. We will recruit farmers with hypertension who meet the study criteria. Moreover, in phase II, we will invite expert nurses and nutritionists to assess the face and content validity of the questionnaire. We will use multiple logistic regression models to estimate the associated sociodemographic factors and the level of acceptability of a PBD. Furthermore, a linear generalized estimating equation will be used to estimate the parameters of a generalized linear model with a possible unmeasured correlation between observations from different time points for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. RESULTS: A model PBD for hypertension management is expected to be developed. In 2022, we will collect information on hypertension and the characteristics of local food sources for managing hypertension, and will formulate a PBD menu to treat hypertension among farmers. In 2023, we will develop a questionnaire to assess the acceptability of a PBD to manage hypertension among farmers, the prevalence of hypertension, and the sociodemographic factors associated with hypertension among farmers. We will implement a community-based nursing program for managing hypertension using a PBD among farmers. CONCLUSIONS: The PBD model will not be readily available for other agricultural areas since validation of local food variation is required to design the menu. We expect contributions from the local government to implement the intervention as one of the policies in the management of hypertension for farmers in the agricultural plantation areas of Jember. This program may also be implemented in other agricultural countries with similar problems, so that hypertension can be optimally treated among farmers.

      "abstract": "There has been no study of the therapeutic effect of a plant-based diet (PBD) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) except for our studies in Japan. In this review, we describe the rationale for the requirement of PBD in IBD and the outcomes of our modality incorporating PBD together with a literature review. The biggest problem in current therapy for IBD is the lack of a widely appreciated ubiquitous environmental factor in IBD. Therefore, a radical strategy against IBD has not been established. Japanese data showed an increased incidence of IBD in association with dietary westernization. Current global consumption consists of an excess of unhealthy foods and a shortage of healthy foods recognized as pro-inflammatory. Patients with IBD are no exception. One of the recommended healthy reference diets is PBD recognized as anti-inflammatory. We assert that IBD occurs in susceptible individuals mainly as a result of our omnivorous (westernized) diet. Therefore, we developed and began to provide a PBD, a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, for IBD patients in 2003. Infliximab and PBD as first-line (IPF) therapy was administered for all patients with newly developed Crohn's disease (CD) and for severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Our modality broke the barrier of primary nonresponders to biologics, with a remission rate of 96% in CD, and created a new relapse-free course in slightly over half of the patients (52%) with CD. Based on the rationale derived from available evidence and the clinical outcomes, PBD is highly recommended for IBD."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: While the benefits of adopting a more plant-based diet for sustainability and animal welfare are clear, its long-term health impacts, including the impact on cognitive ageing, are limited studied. Therefore, we investigated the associations between plant-based diet adherence and cognitive ageing. METHODS: Data from a previous intervention study involving community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 65 years were analysed at baseline (n = 658) and after 2-year follow-up (n = 314). Global and domain-specific cognitive functioning were assessed at both timepoints. Overall, healthful and unhealthful plant-based dietary indices were calculated from a 190-item food frequency questionnaire. Multivariate-adjusted linear regression models were applied to test for associations. RESULTS: After full-adjustment, higher overall adherence to a plant-based diet was not associated with global cognitive function (difference in Z-score, tertile 1 versus 3 [95% CI]: 0.04 [- 0.05, 0.13] p = 0.40) or cognitive change (- 0.04 [- 0.11, 0.04], p = 0.35). Similarly, healthful and unhealthful plant-based diet indices were not associated with cognitive functioning (respectively p = 0.48; p = 0.87) or change (respectively p = 0.21, p = 0.33). Interestingly, we observed fish consumption to influence the association between plant-based diet adherence and cognitive functioning (p-interaction = 0.01), with only individuals with a fish consumption of ≥ 0.93 portion/week benefitting from better overall plant-based diet adherence (β per 10-point increment [95% CI]: 0.12 [0.03, 0.21] p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: We did not demonstrate associations of a more plant-based diet with cognitive ageing. However, possibly such association exists in a subpopulation with higher fish intake. This would be in line with earlier observations that diets rich in plant foods and fish, such as the Mediterranean diet, may be beneficial for cognitive ageing.

      "abstract": "More than 2 million people live with multiple sclerosis worldwide and the prevalence has been increasing over time. Patients living with multiple sclerosis often explore diet and lifestyle interventions as a means of managing their symptoms and reducing reliance on medication; yet, these approaches are rarely discussed with their physicians. Currently, there is a lack of evidence on when to stop disease-modifying therapies (DMT), and recent research showed no statistically significant difference in the time between relapses when comparing participants who stopped DMT to those who did not, especially over the age of 45. This case report presents 2 patients with multiple sclerosis who made an informed decision to stop their DMT medications and have been managing their condition with a whole food plant-based diet and a healthy lifestyle approach. Over the period of 5 to 6 years since stopping the medications, each patient only had 1 multiple sclerosis flare-up to date. In the report, the focus is on the impact of diet on multiple sclerosis. It adds to currently available literature and encourages further research in the field of managing multiple sclerosis with lifestyle interventions."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the association between the plant-based diet index (PDI) score and T2D risk among residents of Shanxi Province, China, and explore whether the association was influenced by different levels of cardiovascular risk. A total of 50,694 participants aged 35-75 years were recruited between 2017 and 2019, and they were further divided into the high cardiovascular risk population (HCRP; n = 17,255) and the non-high cardiovascular risk population (non-HCRP; n = 33,439). The PDI was calculated based on food frequency from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Incident T2D was defined based on elevated plasma glucose (≥7 mmol/L) or hypoglycemic medicine use. We investigated the association of the PDI andT2D risk using a two-level generalized estimating equation and restricted cubic splines model. The results showed that quartile 4 of the PDI indicated significantly reduced T2D risk in the total population (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.75-0.92), HCRP (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.71-0.91), and non-HCRP (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.74-0.87) compared with corresponding quartile 1 (OR = 1). In stratified analysis, the negative associations between PDI and T2D risk were stronger in the total population with the elderly (age > 60 years), BMI < 24, and men, and in the non-HCRP with men and BMI 24-28, and in the HCRP with the elderly and BMI < 24 than those with corresponding subgroups (pinteraction < 0.05). Linear curves were observed for the total population and non-HCRP, but an L-shaped association was observed for the HCRP. Therefore, our results suggest that higher PDI scores may effectively attenuate the T2D risk in the Chinese population and non-HCRP, and a beneficial association of PDI with T2D risk was observed in the HCRP at a certain threshold level. Longitudinal studies and intervention trials are required to validate our study findings.",

A plant-based diet is associated with a healthier lifestyle and has positive effects on various diseases. More and more healthy active people and performance-orientated athletes are giving up animal products for various reasons, such as for an improved performance or faster regeneration. However, the data in this context are limited. This study aimed to obtain initial findings on the influence of a diet change to veganism on the performance of strength-trained individuals. For this study, a total of 15 omnivorous individuals were recruited. They documented their dietary food intakes over 16 weeks. Every four weeks, the strength performance was tested via a leg press and bench press. In the first 8 weeks, the participants maintained their omnivorous diet, followed by 8 weeks of a vegan dietary phase. In total, 10 subjects participated successfully, and their data were part of the statistical analyses. There was no difference in the absolute and relative strength performance for the leg and bench press after changing to a vegan diet. For the total calorie intake and carbohydrates, only a small treatment effect, but no time effect, was observed. However, for the protein intake, a time and group effect were detected. In addition, the relative protein intake decreased significantly and was lower than the current recommendations for athletes. The results demonstrate that a change to a vegan diet has no beneficial nor negative effect on the strength performance when the total calorie intake and carbohydrate content are covered in the first 8 weeks.",

However, it's effectiveness in routine clinical settings is less well documented. This study describes the implementation and outcomes of a \"Food as Prevention\" program run by a single clinician. METHODS: Participants were referred to a \"Food as Prevention\" program run by a single gastroenterologist at an academic teaching center. The program included 5 physician-led discussion and small group educational sessions. Data collected included demographics, weight and biochemical measurements before and after completion of the program. Statistical analysis included paired t-test and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess differences before and after WFPB implementation. RESULTS: A total of 17 participants (age 59 years; 59% female) with an average weight of 90.0 kg attended a median of 3 group sessions. Majority of patients had hyperlipidemia (71%) followed by hypertension (47%) and coronary artery disease (35%), fatty liver disease (35%) and diabetes mellitus (29%). Adoption of a WFPB diet led to significant decreases in weight (4.3 kg; p < 0.01), total cholesterol (0.72 mmol/L; p = 0.046), and triglycerides (0.53 mmol/L; p = 0.005) with an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (0.10 mmol/L; p = 0.01).Conclusions Implementation of the WFPB diet in this novel pilot program led to weight loss and improvement in biochemical markers of disease. Future studies are needed to implement this model on a larger scale."

Messages were either combined or not combined with dynamic norms (i.e., information that more and more people are enacting the behavior). We compared these messages with a control condition (i.e., no message intervention) and we also analyzed the moderation effect of receivers' identification with flexitarians (i.e., people who occasionally eat animal products) and attitudes towards them. In the short term, addition messages increased legume consumption more than replacement messages, especially in people with a negative evaluation of flexitarians and low identification with them. In the long term, increased legume consumption was recorded only when addition messages were combined with dynamic norms. As for meat consumption, the replacement messages were more effective in reducing it in the short term than in the long term, especially in people with positive attitudes towards flexitarians. However, replacement messages combined with dynamic norms were more effective in the long term than in the short term. These results advance our comprehension of how to tailor dietary messages.",

However, an inadequately planned PBD also bear the potential for deficiencies in certain macro- and micronutrients. The present study analyzed nutrient profiles of individuals who adopted a PBD as part of the CardioVeg study. Participants with cardiovascular risk factors were randomly assigned to either a whole-food PBD intervention (n = 36; eight 90 min group meetings including two 120 min cooking sessions) or a control group asked to maintain an omnivorous diet (n = 34) for eight weeks. Food intake data were collected using three-day weighed food records and analyzed with NutriGuide software, including the German Nutrient Data Base (German: Bundeslebensmittelschlüssel). Nutrient intake was compared before and after eight weeks as well as between the groups. The results for both groups were then contrasted to the current dietary recommendations published by the societies for nutrition in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Moreover, anthropometric/laboratory data and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were determined at baseline and after 8 weeks. Data of a subsample (n = 18 in the PBD group and n = 19 in the control group) were used for the present analyses of the dietary intake data. A PBD yielded several benefits including (but not limited to) a lower energy density, a lower intake of cholesterol and saturated fat, an increased consumption of fiber, and a lower intake of salt. Recommended intakes of most vitamins and minerals were generally met, except for vitamin B12 in the PBD group. A low intake of several other critical nutrients (vitamin D, iodine) was observed in both groups. Compared with the control group, PBD resulted in a significant decrease in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, HbA1c, and fasting blood glucose after 8 weeks. Overall, it can be concluded that a PBD had a more favorable nutrient composition for cardiovascular health than the omnivorous dietary pattern of the control group.",

PBD refers to any dietary pattern that emphasizes the consumption of plant foods while excluding the consumption of most or all animal products. The purpose of this mini-review is to report on the application of PBDs as a potential treatment for obesity. PBDs have also been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of other non-communicable diseases, such as the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Many of the reported RCTs were of short duration. Longer-term studies, as well as studies focusing on strict adherence to the PBD regime, are needed. PBD is a beneficial approach to improving health, particularly in obese patients. Benefits include weight loss, improved cardiovascular health, lower blood pressure, and improved glucose metabolism."

Ten-year long-term relapse-free rates in Crohn's disease are around 10% to 23%. Objective We investigated whether infliximab and plant-based diet as first-line therapy enhance the long-term relapse-free rate in patients with Crohn's disease. Methods This single-group, prospective study was performed in tertiary hospitals in Japan. Remission was induced in 24 consecutive newly diagnosed adult patients with Crohn's disease during hospitalization via 3 standard infliximab infusions together with a plant-based diet. Patients were instructed to continue the diet after discharge. Scheduled maintenance infliximab infusion was not used. The primary endpoint was relapse, which was defined as the appearance of symptoms resulting in the alteration of therapeutic modality. The secondary endpoints were C-reactive protein level, plant-based diet score, and surgery. Results The median follow-up period was 8.6 years. Thirteen cases were relapse-free. The relapse-free rate evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years was 79%, 66%, 57%, and 52%, respectively. There was no further reduction afterward up to 10 years. The relapse-free rate with normal C-reactive protein levels at 1 to 2 and 3 to 10 years was 57% and 52%, respectively. The plant-based diet score at 20 months and 5 years was significantly higher relative to baseline (p < 0.0001). Surgical rates at 5 and 10 years were 12% and 19%, respectively. Conclusions Infliximab and plant-based diet as first-line therapy created an unprecedented relapse-free course in nearly half of patients with Crohn's disease.",

Dietary intervention that reduces or excludes animal ingredients results in rapid reduction of plasma TMAO and TMAO precursors in people, but the impact of diet in dogs has not been studied. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of diet on plasma TMAO and 2 of its precursors (choline and betaine) in dogs fed a commercial extruded plant-based diet (PBD) or a commercial extruded traditional diet (TD) containing animal and plant ingredients. Sixteen healthy adult mixed breed dogs from a university colony were enrolled in a randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover weight-maintenance study. Mean (SD) age and body weight of the dogs were 2.9 years (± 1.7) and 14.5 kg (± 4.0), respectively. Eight dogs were female (3 intact, 5 spayed) and 8 dogs were male (4 intact, 4 castrated). Plasma choline, betaine and TMAO were quantified by LC-SID-MRM/MS at baseline, and after 4 weeks on each diet. Choline and betaine were also quantified in the diets. Plasma choline levels were significantly lower (P = 0.002) in dogs consuming a PBD (Mean ± SD, 6.8 μM ± 1.2 μM) compared to a TD (Mean ± SD, 7.8 μM ± 1.6 μM). Plasma betaine levels were also significantly lower (P = 0.03) in dogs consuming a PBD (Mean ± SD, 109.1 μM ± 25.3 μM) compared to a TD (Mean ± SD, 132.4 μM ± 32.5 μM). No difference (P = 0.71) in plasma TMAO was detected in dogs consuming a PBD (Median, IQR, 2.4 μM, 2.1 μM) compared to a TD (Median, IQR, 2.3 μM, 1.1 μM). Betaine content was lower in the PBD than in the TD while choline content was similar in the diets. Our findings indicate consumption of a commercial extruded PBD for 4 weeks reduces circulating levels of the TMAO precursors choline and betaine, but not TMAO, in healthy adult dogs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plant-based diets are increasingly popular and have many well-established benefits for health and environmental sustainability. Our objective was to perform a systematic review of plant-based diets and prostate cancer. METHODS: We performed a systematic database and citation search in February 2022. Studies were included if they reported primary data on plant-based dietary patterns (i.e., vegan, vegetarian, plant-based) and incidence among at-risk men for prostate cancer, or oncologic, general health/nutrition, or quality of life outcomes among patients with prostate cancer or caregivers. RESULTS: A total of 32 publications were eligible for the qualitative synthesis, representing 5 interventional and 11 observational studies. Interventional studies primarily focused on lifestyle modification including plant-based diets for men on active surveillance for localized prostate cancer or with biochemical recurrence after treatment, showing improvements in short-term oncologic outcomes alongside improvements in general health and nutrition. Observational studies primarily focused on prostate cancer risk, showing either protective or null associations for plant-based dietary patterns. Studies of the vegan diet consistently showed favorable associations with risk and/or outcomes. Gaps in the current literature include impact for long-term disease-specific outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Interventional studies showed generally favorable results of lifestyle modifications incorporating a plant-based diet with prostate cancer outcomes as well as improvements in nutrition and general health. Observational studies demonstrated either a lower risk of prostate cancer or no significant difference. These results are encouraging in light of the many benefits of plant-based diets for overall health, as well as environmental sustainability and animal welfare.",

The objective of the current study was to evaluate whether this dietary pattern would protect against oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, two common characteristics of MetS. We recruited 24 men and women with MetS, who, after following a PBD for 2 weeks (baseline), were randomly allocated to consume either two whole eggs with 70 g of spinach/day (EGG) or the equivalent amount of egg substitute with spinach (SUB) as breakfast for 4 weeks. After a 3-week washout, they were allocated to the alternate breakfast. We measured biomarkers of oxidation and inflammation at baseline and at the end of each intervention. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, monocyte protein attractant-1, liver enzymes, and C-reactive protein, as well as total antioxidant capacity, paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity, and other biomarkers of oxidation were not different at the end of EGG or SUB or when compared to baseline. However, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were lower (p < 0.05) during the EGG and baseline compared to SUB. In addition, the increases in dietary lutein and zeaxanthin previously observed had a strong positive correlation with PON-1 activity (r = 0.522, p < 0.01) only during the EGG period, whereas plasma zeaxanthin was negatively correlated with MDA (r = −0.437, p < 0.01). The number of participants with MetS was reduced from 24 during screening to 21, 13, and 17 during the BL, EGG, and SUB periods, respectively, indicating that eggs were more effective in reversing the characteristics of MetS. These data suggest that adding eggs to a PBD does not detrimentally affect inflammation or oxidative stress; on the contrary, eggs seem to provide additional protection against the biomarkers that define MetS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many traditional lifestyle interventions use calorie prescriptions, but most individuals have difficulty sustaining calorie tracking and thus weight loss. In contrast, whole food plant-based diets (WFPBDs) have previously shown significant weight loss without this issue. However, most WFPBD interventions are face-to-face and time-intensive, and do not leverage gold standard behavioral strategies for health behavior change. OBJECTIVE: This open pilot trial was the first to evaluate the feasibility of a fully featured, remotely delivered behavioral weight loss intervention using an ad libitum WFPBD. METHODS: Over 12 weeks, participants (N=15) with overweight or obesity received a newly designed program that integrated behavioral weight loss and a WFPBD prescription via weekly web-based modules and brief phone coaching calls. Assessments were performed at baseline, midtreatment (6 weeks), and after treatment (12 weeks). RESULTS: The intervention was rated as highly acceptable (mean 4.40 out of 5, SE 0.18), and attrition was low (6.7%). In all, intention-to-treat analyses revealed that 69% (10.4/15) of the participants lost 5% of their weight (mean -5.89, SE 0.68 kg). Predefined benchmarks for quality of life were met. CONCLUSIONS: A pilot digital behavioral weight loss intervention with a non-energy-restricted WFPBD was feasible, and the mean acceptability was high. Minimal contact time (80-150 minutes of study interventionist time per participant over 12 weeks) led to clinically relevant weight loss and dietary adherence for most participants (10.4/15, 69% and 11.8/15, 79%, respectively), and quality of life improvements (reliable change indices >1.53). We hope that this work will serve as a springboard for future larger scale randomized controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of such programs for weight loss, dietary change, and quality of life.

      "abstract": "Plant-based (PB) diets are considered a healthy dietary pattern; however, eggs are not always included in this dietary regime. We hypothesized that the addition of two eggs per day would increase HDL cholesterol as well as plasma lutein, zeaxanthin and choline in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS). In this randomized controlled crossover intervention, we recruited 30 participants (49.3 ± 8 y) with MetS who followed a PB diet for 13 weeks. A registered dietitian advised all subjects on food selection and followed them through the intervention to ensure compliance. Participants underwent a 2-week washout with no eggs or spinach (a source of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin) and were randomly allocated to consume spinach (70 g) with either two eggs (EGG) or the equivalent amount of egg substitute (SUB) for breakfast for 4 weeks. After a 3-week washout, they were allocated the alternate breakfast. A total of 24 participants (13 women/11 men) finished the intervention. Plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, anthropometrics, plasma lutein, zeaxanthin, choline and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) were assessed at baseline and the end of each intervention. When we compared individuals consuming the EGG versus the SUB breakfast, we observed a lower body weight (p < 0.02) and a higher HDL cholesterol (p < 0.025) after the EGG diet. There were no differences in plasma LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, or blood pressure. The number of large HDL particles measured by NMR was higher after EGG (p < 0.01) as compared to SUB. Plasma choline was higher in both treatments (p < 0.01) compared to baseline (8.3 ± 2.1 μmol/L). However, plasma choline values were higher in EGG (10.54 ± 2.8 μmol/L) compared to SUB (9.47 ± 2.7 μmol/L) p < 0.025. Both breakfasts increased plasma lutein compared to baseline (p < 0.01), while plasma zeaxanthin was only increased in the egg intervention (p < 0.01). These results indicate that consuming a plant-based diet in combination with whole eggs increases plasma HDL cholesterol, choline and zeaxanthin, important biomarkers in subjects with MetS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a toxic end-product of microbial fermentation produced in the colon that may play a role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. However, the effect of diet interventions on intestinal burden of H2S gas exposure remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: Determine the effect of short-term (1-week) plant- and animal-based eating patterns on ex vivo fecal H2S production in healthy human volunteers. METHODS: The study design was an open-label, cross-over diet study and diets were self-administered. Each participant consumed two interventional diets: 1) an animal-based, low fiber (i.e. western) diet and 2) a plant-based, high fiber diet, separated by a two-week washout period. Participants collected full stool samples at the end of each week, which were processed within 2 h of collection to capture H2S production. Microfluidic qPCR (MFQPCR) was used to simultaneously quantify multiple taxonomic and functional groups involved in sulfate reduction and the fecal microbiota was characterized through high-throughput DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Median H2S production was higher following the animal-based diet compared to the plant-based diet (p = 0.02; median difference 29 ppm/g, 95% CI 16-97). However, there was substantial individual variability and 2 of 11 individuals (18%) produced more H2S on the plant-based diet. Using the top and bottom quartiles of H2S percent change between animal- and plant-based diet weeks to define responders and non-responders, significant taxonomic differences were observed between the responder and non-responder cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Here we report that substrate changes associated with a 1-week plant-based diet intervention resulted in lower ex vivo H2S production compared to a 1-week animal-based diet intervention in most healthy individuals. However, H2S responsiveness to diet was not uniform across the entire cohort, and potential H2S production enterotypes were characterized that may predict individualized H2S responsiveness to diet.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of 21 942 men aged 40 to 75 years who were enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. ED was assessed with questionnaires every 4 years starting in 2000. Dietary data were collected via validated food frequency questionnaires completed every 4 years and were used to calculate total PDI scores, as well as healthy (hPDI) and unhealthy (uPDI) subscores. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for incident ED. All models were stratified by age (<60, 60 to <70, ≥70 years). RESULTS: Among men aged 60 to <70 years, hPDI was inversely associated with incident ED. Those in the highest quintile of hPDI in that age group had an 18% lower risk of ED (HR 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.91; P-trend <0.001) compared to those in the lowest quintile. Conversely, uPDI was positively associated with ED in men aged <60 years (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.60; P-trend = 0.02).

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We regard inflammatory bowel disease as a lifestyle disease mainly mediated by a westernized diet. We developed a plant-based diet (PBD) to counter the westernized diet. PBD can induce remission without medication in a subset of mild cases of ulcerative colitis. Medication is provided when induction of remission is not achieved solely with PBD. We describe such a case in this report. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old woman visited us in October 2016 with a complaint of loose stool for nearly 5 years. Laboratory examination revealed mild abnormalities including elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP). Ulcerative colitis was diagnosed due to diffuse colonic inflammation and pathological findings consistent with ulcerative colitis. She was admitted for educational hospitalization for 19 days in the middle of November, during which PBD was provided. A few days after admission, her stool became normal. CRP concentration decreased to within the normal range. However, colonoscopy on discharge showed minimum improvement. Thereafter, CRP was abnormal on three successive occasions, and her stool alternated between normal and loose. Sulfasalazine was initiated at the end of March 2017. Thereafter, her stool was normally formed, and CRP decreased to normal. Endoscopic remission was confirmed in August. Her PBD score, which evaluates adherence to PBD, was 8 before admission, and 37 and 16 at 7 and 21 months after discharge, respectively. CONCLUSION: Medication was administered when restoration of a healthy dietary lifestyle was insufficient to induce remission. Our stepwise treatment makes the shift from one-size-fits-all medication toward medication to the right patient. REGISTRATION: http://www.umin.ac.jp UMIN000019061.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide, where nutritional intervention should be part of a multidisciplinary lifestyle approach in oncology, promoting therapeutic success. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), along with estrogen, can promote the development of neoplastic cells in breast tissue. Cancers that develop under IGF-1 stimulation are often resistant to therapy. This case report describes a 47-year-old woman, body mass index 27.4 kg/m2, with HER2-positive breast cancer, as well as elevated blood glucose, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Soon after her breast cancer diagnosis, she transitioned from a Western pattern diet (WPD) to a predominantly whole-food, plant-based diet (PWFPBD) for 1035 days, followed by 232 days of PWFPBD plus night fasting for 16 hours per day. IGF-1 decreased 22.38%, glycemia and total cholesterol decreased by -55.06% and -36.00% at the end of the first intervention and went up by 6.25%, and 3.87%, respectively, at the end of the second intervention. A PWFPBD, with or without 16-hour overnight fasting, seems to modulate plasma levels of IGF-1 on a 47-year-old woman diagnosed with breast cancer, type HER2-positive. Future research, should explore the physiologic and pathophysiological mechanisms and clarify whether this dietary strategy, may be clinically useful in preventing HER2-positive breast cancer."

Longitudinal data on 710 participants (aged 26-70 years) with overweight or obesity and pre-diabetes from the 3-year weight-loss maintenance phase of the PREVIEW intervention were analyzed. Adherence to an overall plant-based diet was evaluated using a novel plant-based diet index, where all plant-based foods received positive scores and all animal-based foods received negative scores. After adjustment for potential confounders, linear mixed models with repeated measures showed that the plant-based diet index was inversely associated with weight regain, but not with cardiometabolic risk factors. Nut intake was inversely associated with regain of weight and fat mass and increments in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Fruit intake was inversely associated with increments in diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. Vegetable intake was inversely associated with an increment in diastolic blood pressure and triglycerides and was positively associated with an increase in HDL cholesterol. All reported associations with cardiometabolic risk factors were independent of weight change. Long-term consumption of nuts, fruits, and vegetables may be beneficial for weight management and cardiometabolic health, whereas an overall plant-based diet may improve weight management only.",

Within 2 months, his headache frequency declined from 18 to 24 headache days per month to 1, and he discontinued his preventive and abortive migraine medications. After 3 months, the patient had no headaches. These results far exceed the goal of migraine treatment with medication, which is to reduce migraine frequency by >50% per month. In addition, the results were durable; this patient has been migraine-free for 7.5 years. Serum beta-carotene more than tripled after the patient started the LIFE diet, consistent with its high content of dark green leafy vegetables.

      "abstract": "Within the last decades, plant-based diets have received increasing interest for their potential benefits to human and environmental health. The concept of plant-based diet, however, varies widely in its definition. Current definitions range from the exclusion of all animal products to diets that include meat, fish, and dairy in varying quantities. Therefore, the main objectives of this review were twofold: (a) to investigate how researchers use the term plant-based diet in nutrition intervention studies and (b) what types of food a plant-based diet may include. Searching two databases, we found that the term \"plant-based diet\" evokes varying ideas to researchers and clinicians. Fifty percent of the retrieved studies that included a plant-based dietary intervention completely proscribed animal products and used the term plant-based diet interchangeably with a vegan diet. In contrast, an ~33% of trials included dairy products and 20% of dietary interventions emphasized a semi-vegetarian dietary pattern. Based on specific examples, we point out how the usage of the umbrella term \"plant-based diet\" may cause significant ambiguity. We often encountered incomplete descriptions of plant-based dietary interventions, which makes comparison and reproducibility of studies difficult. As a consequence, we urge others to use the term \"plant-based diet\" only in conjunction with a detailed dietary description. To facilitate this process, we provide a template of a standardized plant-based intervention reporting checklist. Finally, the present review also highlights the urgent need for a consensus definition of the term plant-based diet and its content.",

To date, the effects of such interventions on the gut microbiome and on modern diagnostic markers in patients with RA have not been studied. This trial aims to investigate the clinical effects of therapeutic fasting and a plant-based diet in patients with RA, additionally considering current immunological diagnostic tools and microbiome analyses. METHODS/DESIGN: This trial is an open-label, single-centre, randomised, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. We will randomly assign 84 patients with RA under a stable standard therapy to either (1) therapeutic fasting followed by a plant-based dietary intervention or (2) to a conventional nutritional counselling focusing on an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern according to the recommendations of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung (German society for nutrition). Primary outcome parameter is the group difference from baseline to 12 weeks on the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Other secondary outcomes include established clinical criteria for disease activity and treatment response in RA (Disease Activity Score 28, Simple Disease Activity Index, ACR-Response Criteria), changes in self-reported health and physical functional ability, mood, stress, quality of life, dietary behaviour via 3-day food records and a modified Food Frequency Questionnaire, body composition, changes in the gut microbiome, metabolomics and cytometric parameters. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and day 7, after 6 weeks, 12 weeks and after 6 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval to process and analyse data, and to publish the results was obtained through the institutional review board of Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Results of this trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and scientific presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03856190.",

METHODS: Participants (n = 244) were randomly assigned to an intervention (vegan) (n = 122) or control group (n = 122) for 16 weeks. Before and after the intervention period, body composition was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry. Insulin resistance was assessed with the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) index and predicted insulin sensitivity index (PREDIM). Repeated measure ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) and Net Endogenous Acid Production (NEAP) decreased significantly in the vegan group with no change in the control group (treatment effect -24.7 mEq/day [95% CI -30.2 to -19.2]; p < 0.001; and -23.8 mEq/day [95% CI -29.6 to -18.0]; p < 0.001, respectively). Body weight decreased by 6.4 kg in the vegan group, compared with 0.5 kg in the control group (treatment effect -5.9 kg [95% CI -6.8 to -5.0]; Gxt, p < 0.001), largely due to a reduction in fat mass and visceral fat. HOMA-IR index decreased and PREDIM increased in the vegan group. After adjustment for energy intake, changes in PRAL and NEAP correlated positively with changes in body weight (r = +0.37; p < 0.001; and r = +0.37; p < 0.001, respectively), fat mass (r = +0.32; p < 0.001; and r = +0.32; p < 0.001, respectively), visceral fat (r = +0.19; p = 0.006; and r = +0.15; p = 0.03, respectively), and HOMA (r = +0.17; p = 0.02; and r = +0.20; p = 0.006, respectively), and negatively with changes in PREDIM (r = -0.22; p = 0.002; and r = -0.27; p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Dietary acid load as part of a plant-based diet was associated with changes in body weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity, independent of energy intake.

METHODS: Data on demographics, diet, and PSA levels was acquired from the NHANES database. Plant-based diet index (PDI) and healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) were calculated using food frequency questionnaires. A higher score on PDI and hPDI indicates higher consumption of plant foods or healthy plant foods, respectively. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between elevated PSA, clinical variables, demographics, and plant-based diet indices. RESULTS: A total of 1399 men were included in the final cohort. Median age of participants was 54 [46-63] years. Median PSA level was 0.9 [0.6-1.5] ng/dL, and 69 (4.9%) men had a PSA level ≥4 ng/dL. Although there was no association between elevated PSA and PDI, on multivariable analysis patients with higher consumption of healthy plant-based diet (high hPDI scores) had a decreased probability of having an elevated PSA (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.24-0.95; P = .034). CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between increased consumption of a healthy plant-based diet and lower PSA levels. This finding may be incorporated into the shared-decision making process with patients to promote healthier lifestyle choices to reduce the likelihood of prostate biopsy and potential treatment-related morbidity.",

METHODS: Postmenopausal women (n = 38) reporting two or more hot flashes/day were randomly assigned to a low-fat, vegan diet, including ½ cup (86 g) of cooked soybeans daily, or to no diet changes for 12 weeks. Frequency and severity of hot flashes were recorded using a mobile application, and vasomotor, psychosocial, physical, and sexual symptoms were assessed using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. Significance was assessed using t-tests (continuous outcomes) and chi-squared/McNemar tests (binary outcomes). RESULTS: Total hot flashes decreased 79% in the intervention group (P < 0.001) and 49% in the control group (P = 0.002; between-group P = 0.01). Moderate-to-severe hot flashes decreased 84% in the intervention group (P < 0.001) and 42% in the control group P = 0.009; between-group P = 0.01). From 0 to 12 weeks, 59% (10/17) of intervention-group participants reported becoming free of moderate and severe hot flashes (P = 0.002). There was no change in this variable in the control group (between-group P < 0.001). The Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire revealed significantly greater reductions in the intervention group in vasomotor (P < 0.0001), psychosocial (P = 0.04), physical (P < 0.002), and sexual (P = 0.01) domains. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of a low-fat, vegan diet and whole soybeans was associated with reduced frequency and severity of hot flashes and improved quality of life in vasomotor, psychosocial, physical, and sexual domains in postmenopausal women. During the 12-week study period, the majority of intervention-group participants became free of moderate-to-severe hot flashes.",

Methods: A WFPB diet was implemented for 5 months in this case study. Functionality, biometrics, and quality of life were assessed at regular intervals via blood work, vital signs, and patient surveys. Results: After 10 weeks, 2 medications were de-prescribed due to improvement in blood glucose levels and blood pressure readings. Neuromuscular symptoms lessened as measured by the Myasthenia Gravis Illness Index. Weight loss of 18.7 pounds was achieved. No deterioration in physical activity was reported throughout the 5-month trial of WFPB diet. Discussion: Our results have implications that an individualized dietary strategy may be considered as one component of management of NMJ diseases. The effects of WFPB diet on NMJ diseases remain inconclusive."

The symptoms remitted completely with close adherence to the WFPB diet and recurred on multiple occasions associated with poor dietary adherence. There was a self-identified dose-response relationship with degree of adherence and number and intensity of flares. There were no known adverse side effects from the diet change, although the patient felt adherence to be difficult at times. The mechanism is not completely clear; we speculate that the dietary changes directly affect vascular endothelial health, which in turn affects propensity towards a prothrombotic state.

However, the effects of an exclusively plant-based protein diet on resistance training-induced adaptations are under investigation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of dietary protein source [exclusively plant-based vs. mixed diet] on changes in muscle mass and strength in healthy young men undertaking resistance training. METHODS: Nineteen young men who were habitual vegans (VEG 26 ± 5 years; 72.7 ± 7.1 kg, 22.9 ± 2.3 kg/m2) and nineteen young men who were omnivores (OMN 26 ± 4 years; 73.3 ± 7.8 kg, 23.6 ± 2.3 kg/m2) undertook a 12-week, twice weekly, supervised resistance training program. Habitual protein intake was assessed at baseline and adjusted to 1.6 g kg-1 day-1 via supplemental protein (soy for VEG or whey for OMN). Dietary intake was monitored every four weeks during the intervention. Leg lean mass, whole muscle, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), as well as leg-press 1RM were assessed before (PRE) and after the intervention (POST). RESULTS: Both groups showed significant (all p < 0.05) PRE-to-POST increases in leg lean mass (VEG: 1.2 ± 1.0 kg; OMN: 1.2 ± 0.8 kg), rectus femoris CSA (VEG: 1.0 ± 0.6 cm2; OMN: 0.9 ± 0.5 cm2), vastus lateralis CSA (VEG: 2.2 ± 1.1 cm2; OMN: 2.8 ± 1.0 cm2), vastus lateralis muscle fiber type I (VEG: 741 ± 323 µm2; OMN: 677 ± 617 µm2) and type II CSA (VEG: 921 ± 458 µm2; OMN: 844 ± 638 µm2), and leg-press 1RM (VEG: 97 ± 38 kg; OMN: 117 ± 35 kg), with no between-group differences for any of the variables (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: A high-protein (~ 1.6 g kg-1 day-1), exclusively plant-based diet (plant-based whole foods + soy protein isolate supplementation) is not different than a protein-matched mixed diet (mixed whole foods + whey protein supplementation) in supporting muscle strength and mass accrual, suggesting that protein source does not affect resistance training-induced adaptations in untrained young men consuming adequate amounts of protein.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: About one-third of patients with severe ulcerative colitis (UC) do not respond to corticosteroid therapy and receive rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine. Up to 20% of such patients fail to respond to rescue therapy and undergo colectomy. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the outcomes of infliximab and a plant-based diet (PBD) as first-line therapy for severe UC. METHODS: Patients with severe UC defined by the Truelove and Witts criteria were admitted and given standard induction therapy with infliximab (5.0 mg/kg-7.5 mg/kg) at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Additionally, they received a PBD. The primary endpoint was remission or colectomy in the induction phase and 1 year after discharge. Secondary endpoints were changes in inflammatory markers in the induction phase and the PBD score at baseline and follow-up. A higher PBD score indicates greater adherence to a PBD. RESULTS: Infliximab and PBD as first-line therapy was administered in 17 cases. The remission rate was 76% (13/17), and the colectomy rate was 6% (1/17) in the induction phase. C-reactive protein values and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate significantly decreased at week 6 from 9.42 mg/dL to 0.33 mg/dL and from 59 to 17 mm/h, respectively (p < 0.0001). At 1-year follow-up, the cumulative relapse rate was 25%, and there were no additional colectomy cases. Mean PBD scores of 27.7 at 1 year and 23.8 at 4 years were significantly higher than baseline scores of 8.3 and 9.9, respectively (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0391). CONCLUSION: This new first-line therapy for severe UC demonstrated a higher remission rate and lower colectomy rate than with the current modality.",

Plant-based diets decrease the incidence of CKD and progression of kidney disease and help prevent and treat the important comorbidities of obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. However, in patients with CKD, there is concern that a plant-based diet may contribute to life-threatening hyperkalemia. We present a patient with CKD secondary to hypertensive glomerulosclerosis that worsened despite standard of care treatment. Shared decision making was used to initiate a whole food plant-based diet along with a potassium-binding resin (Patiromer) to control the potassium levels. The patient was able to be maintained on the whole food plant-based diet and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor without the development of hyperkalemia. This case shows that patients with CKD may be able to enjoy the benefits of a whole food plant-based diet while decreasing the risk of hyperkalemia by using the new potassium binders."

DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a clinical trial involving adults receiving hemodialysis therapy. Usual dietary intake was determined using a diet history method administered by Accredited Practising Dietitians. Two approaches were used for diet quality assessment: (1) using three a priori defined plant-based diet indices-an overall plant-based diet index (PDI), a healthy PDI, and an unhealthy PDI and (2) classification of food group intake. Serum uremic toxins (p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate (IS); free and total) were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Gut microbiota composition was established through sequencing the 16S rRNA gene in stool samples. RESULTS: Twenty-two adults (median age 70.5 [interquartile range: 59-76], 64% male) were included in the final analysis. Higher adherence to the PDI was associated with lower total IS levels (P = .028), independent of dialysis adequacy, urinary output, and blood albumin levels. In contrast, higher adherence to the unhealthy PDI was associated with increases in both free and total IS. Several other direct and inverse associations between diet quality with uremic toxins, microbial relative abundances, and diversity metrics were also highlighted. Diet-associated taxa showed significantly different trends of association with serum uremic toxin concentrations (P < .05). Higher adherence to the PDI was negatively associated with relative abundances of Haemophilus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae that were related to elevated total IS levels. In contrast, increased intake of food items considered unhealthy, such as animal fats, sweets and desserts, were associated with bacteria linked to higher IS and p-cresyl sulfate (total and free) concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of diet and food selections may influence uremic toxin production by the gut microbiota in adults receiving hemodialysis. Well-designed dietary intervention trials that adopt multi-omic technologies appropriate for the functional annotation of the gut microbiome are needed to validate our findings and establish causality.",

The major sources of phytoestrogens are soy and soy-based foods, flaxseed, chickpeas, green beans, dairy products, etc. The dietary inclusion of phytoestrogen based foods plays a crucial role in the maintenance of metabolic syndrome cluster, including obesity, diabetes, blood pressure, cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, postmenopausal ailments and their complications. In recent days, phytoestrogens are the preferred molecules for hormone replacement therapy. On the other hand, they act as endocrine disruptors via estrogen receptor-mediated pathways. These effects are not restricted to adult males or females and identified even in development. OBJECTIVE: Since phytoestrogenic occurrence is high at daily meals for most people worldwide, they focused to study for its beneficiary effects towards developing pharmaceutical drugs for treating various metabolic disorders by observing endocrine disruption. CONCLUSION: The present review emphasizes the pros and cons of phytoestrogens on human health, which may help to direct the pharmaceutical industry to produce various phytoestrongen based drugs against various metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "In patients with advanced-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), progressive kidney function decline leads to increased risk for hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.0 or >5.5 mEq/L). Medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors pose an additional hyperkalemia risk, especially in patients with CKD. When hyperkalemia develops, clinicians often recommend a diet that is lower in potassium content. This review discusses the barriers to adherence to a low-potassium diet and the impact of dietary restrictions on adverse clinical outcomes. Accumulating evidence indicates that a diet that incorporates potassium-rich foods has multiple health benefits, which may also be attributable to the other vitamin, mineral, and fiber content of potassium-rich foods. These benefits include blood pressure reductions and reduced risks for cardiovascular disease and stroke. High-potassium foods may also prevent CKD progression and reduce mortality risk in patients with CKD. Adjunctive treatment with the newer potassium-binding agents, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, may allow for optimal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia, potentially making it possible for patients with CKD and hyperkalemia to liberalize their diet. This may allow them the health benefits of a high-potassium diet without the increased risk for hyperkalemia, although further studies are needed."

      "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia in the clinical setting affecting approximately 34 million individuals worldwide. The disease is associated with a significant burden of morbidity and mortality resulting from stroke, heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome. Atrial fibrillation is now a major public health problem with tremendous implications on the economy and the world's healthcare systems. Numerous risk factors and clinical conditions that are associated with the development and progression of atrial fibrillation have been identified in the past. Within the last decades, a shift in awareness toward modifiable conditions has been observed and risk factor management has gained significant momentum. In light of this, dietary approaches are of paramount importance. Whole-food plant-based diets emphasizing grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits and nuts and excluding most (or all) animal products have recently experienced a significantly increased interest. The purpose of this review is to present evidence suggestive of a plant-based diet being a valuable tool in atrial fibrillation risk factor management. The effects of a plant-based diet on both established and emerging risk factors, such as inflammation and subclinical atherosclerosis, are reviewed in this article. A special focus is put on cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors including hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and obesity."

Plant-based diets are known to improve plasma lipid concentrations, reduce blood pressure, and as part of a lifestyle intervention, lead to the regression of atherosclerotic lesions. However, a paucity of data exists with regards to plant-based diets in the treatment of CHF. METHODS: Three patients diagnosed with CHF opted to undergo a dietary intervention consisting of a defined plant-based diet as an adjunct to standard medical treatment for CHF. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed. Patients' consumed the defined plant-based diet for an average of ˜79 days. RESULTS: Follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance images revealed a 92% increase in ejection fraction [mean ± standard deviation for all data] (22.0 ± 6.9% vs 42.2 ± 18.4%), 21% reduction in left ventricular mass (214 ± 90 g vs 170 ± 102 g), 62% increase in stroke volume (55.8 ± 24.3 cc vs 90.3 ± 30.6 cc) and a 17% increase in cardiac output (3.6 ± 1.2 L/min vs 4.2 ± 1.6 L/min). In patient 1, 90-95% ostial stenosis of the left anterior descending artery nearly completely regressed following the dietary intervention. All patients subjectively reported significant clinical improvements, including less angina, shortness of breath and fatigue. CONCLUSION: As an adjunct treatment, a defined plant-based diet may contribute to the reversal of cardiac morphological and functional abnormalities in the setting of CHF.",

Work-up revealed heart failure with depressed left ventricular systolic function. Upon diagnosis, she substantially altered her lifestyle, changing her diet from a \"healthy western\" one to a whole food plant-based one. Guideline directed medical therapy for heart failure was also utilized. Over five and a half months, she lost 22.7 kg and reversed her diabetes without the use of diabetes medications. Her left ventricular systolic function normalized. Although causality cannot be determined, this case highlights the potential role of a plant-based diet in helping to reverse heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the relapse rate in a large case series of UC after incorporation of PBD into induction therapy. DESIGN: All patients with UC between 2003 and 2017 were admitted for induction therapy. Patients receiving educational hospitalization or treated with infliximab were excluded. A lacto-ovo-semivegetarian diet (PBD) together with medication prescribed according to UC guidelines was provided during hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was relapse during follow-up. The secondary endpoint was change over time in the plant-based diet score (PBDS), which evaluated adherence to the PBD. RESULTS: Ninety-two cases were studied, of which 51 were initial episodes and 41 were relapses. Cases varied in severity (31 mild, 48 moderate, 13 severe) and extent (15 proctitis, 22 left-sided colitis, 55 extensive colitis). More severe cases existed among the relapse cases than among the initial episode cases. Cumulative relapse rates at 1- and 5-year follow-up (Kaplan-Meier analysis) were 14% and 27%, respectively, for the initial episode cases, and 36% and 53%, respectively, for relapse cases. At long-term follow-up (6 years 4 months), PBDS was significantly higher than baseline PBDS (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Relapse rates in UC after induction therapy with PBD were far lower than those previously reported with conventional therapy. Adherence to PBD was significantly higher than baseline even at 6-year follow-up. We conclude PBD is effective for preventing UC relapse.(Study identification no.: UMIN000019061: Registration: www.umin.ac.jp).",

In this 16-week randomized clinical trial, we tested the effect of a plant-based diet on body composition and insulin resistance. As a part of this trial, we investigated the role of plant protein on these outcomes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Overweight participants (n = 75) were randomized to follow a plant-based (n = 38) or a control diet (n = 37). Dual X-ray Absorptiometry assessed body composition, Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) assessed insulin resistance, and a linear regression model was used to test the relationship between protein intake, body composition, and insulin resistance. RESULTS: The plant-based vegan diet proved to be superior to the control diet in improving body weight, fat mass, and insulin resistance markers. Only the vegan group showed significant reductions in body weight (treatment effect -6.5 [95% CI -8.9 to -4.1] kg; Gxt, p < 0.001), fat mass (treatment effect -4.3 [95% CI -5.4 to -3.2] kg; Gxt, p < 0.001), and HOMA-IR (treatment effect -1.0 [95% CI -1.2 to -0.8]; Gxt, p = 0.004). The decrease in fat mass was associated with an increased intake of plant protein and decreased intake of animal protein (r = -0.30, p = 0.011; and r = +0.39, p = 0.001, respectively). In particular, decreased % leucine intake was associated with a decrease in fat mass (r = +0.40; p < 0.001), in both unadjusted and adjusted models for changes in BMI and energy intake. In addition, decreased % histidine intake was associated with a decrease in insulin resistance (r = +0.38; p = 0.003), also independent of changes in BMI and energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence that plant protein, as a part of a plant-based diet, and the resulting limitation of leucine and histidine intake are associated with improvements in body composition and reductions in both body weight and insulin resistance.",

Research suggests consumption of a plant-based diet may improve the status of persons with chronic pain. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains has been shown to reduce chronic pain and disability associated with musculoskeletal conditions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the value of a plant-based diet in the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain and functional limitations. METHOD: Fourteen subjects participated in the eight-week study. Baseline evaluation included anthropometric measurements and completion of two self-reported outcome measures: Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). A registered dietitian nutritionist provided a sample menu cycle and education on a plant-based diet. Subjects utilized a phone app to log food intake and receive support from the dietitian. Post data collection included a repeat of the baseline measures and the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale. The sample was small. Twenty subjects began, 14 completed. No comparison group was used. Results should be considered with caution. RESULTS: The diet intervention resulted in decreased pain and improvement in quality of life. Diet adherence by ten of fourteen subjects was 89% based on completion of food intake records and adherence to allowed foods. CONCLUSION: Consumption of a plant-based diet produced positive improvements in chronic pain and function. Interprofessional collaboration between physical therapists and registered dietitian nutritionists, along with other healthcare practitioners, can encourage and promote diet interventions that positively affect chronic pain.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: No known published study has focused on a plant-based diet (PBD) in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). OBJECTIVE: To investigate relapse prevention in UC after consumption of a PBD during educational hospitalization in Japan. DESIGN: Prospective study of patients with mild UC or UC in remission who did not need immediate treatment. A PBD and dietary guidance were provided during a two-week hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was relapse (a flare-up that required more aggressive treatment) during the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the cumulative relapse rate. Secondary end points were immediate improvement in symptoms or laboratory data during hospitalization and a chronologic change in the PBD score, which evaluated adherence to the PBD. RESULTS: Sixty cases were studied: 29 initial episode cases and 31 relapse cases. Of these, 31 involved proctitis; 7, left-sided colitis; and 22, extensive colitis. Thirty-seven patients were receiving medication; 23 were not. The median age was 34 years; median follow-up was 3 years 6 months. Eight cases relapsed during follow-up. The cumulative relapse rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of follow-up were 2%, 4%, 7%, 19%, and 19%, respectively. Most patients (77%) experienced some improvement such as disappearance or decrease of bloody stool during hospitalization. The short- and long-term PBD scores after the hospitalization were higher than baseline PBD scores. CONCLUSION: Relapse rates after educational hospitalization providing a PBD were far lower than those reported with medication. Educational hospitalization is effective at inducing habitual dietary changes.",

We document the case of a 35-year-old man taking acitretin for congenital lamellar ichthyosis associated with a homozygous deleterious mutation in NIPAL4 who developed retinoid-induced hyperlipidemia that responded dramatically to a whole-food plant-based (WFPB) diet. On presentation, his diet consisted of chicken, fish, low fat meats and dairy, grains, and some fruits and vegetables. He then adopted a WFPB diet without making changes to his medications. His serum lipid levels dropped and his exercise capacity improved. Five months later, after discontinuing the plant-based diet and returning to his baseline diet, his hyperlipidemia returned and persisted despite adjustments to his medications. After a year and a half, the patient again adopted a plant-based diet and his lipid levels fell sharply again. A WFPB diet helped improve and control serum lipid levels in a patient with retinoid-induced hyperlipidemia. Future interventions should focus on ways to help patients successfully adopt and maintain a WFPB diet, as increased adherence to a healthy lifestyle is associated with greater health benefits.",

CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, are typically treated with drug therapy. Five-year efficacy of such drugs to prevent CVD is estimated to be 5%. Plant-based diets have emerged as effective mitigators of these risk factors. HYPOTHESIS: The implementation of a defined, plant-based diet for 4 weeks in an outpatient clinical setting may mitigate CVD risk factors and reduce patient drug burden. METHODS: Participants consumed a plant-based diet consisting of foods prepared in a defined method in accordance with a food-classification system. Participants consumed raw fruits, vegetables, seeds, and avocado. All animal products were excluded from the diet. Participant anthropometric and hemodynamic data were obtained weekly for 4 weeks. Laboratory biomarkers were collected at baseline and at 4 weeks. Medication needs were assessed weekly. Data were analyzed using paired-samples t tests and 1-way repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Significant reductions were observed for systolic (-16.6 mmHg) and diastolic (-9.1 mmHg) blood pressure (P < 0.0005), serum lipids (P ≤ 0.008), and total medication usage (P < 0.0005). Other CVD risk factors, including weight (P < 0.0005), waist circumference (P < 0.0005), heart rate (P = 0.018), insulin (P < 0.0005), glycated hemoglobin (P = 0.002), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = 0.001) were also reduced. CONCLUSION: A defined, plant-based diet can be used as an effective therapeutic strategy in the clinical setting to mitigate cardiovascular risk factors and reduce patient drug burden.",

No previous study has focused on a plant-based diet in an induction phase of CD treatment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the remission rate of infliximab combined with a plant-based diet as first-line (IPF) therapy for CD. METHODS: This was a prospective single-group trial conducted at tertiary hospitals. Subjects included consecutive adults with a new diagnosis (n = 26), children with a new diagnosis (n = 11), and relapsing adults (n = 9) with CD who were naïve to treatment with biologics. Patients were admitted and administered a standard induction therapy with infliximab (5 mg/kg; 3 infusions at 0, 2, and 6 weeks). Additionally, they received a lacto-ovo-semivegetarian diet. The primary end point was remission, defined as the disappearance of active CD symptoms at week 6. Secondary end points were Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score, C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, and mucosal healing. RESULTS: Two adults with a new diagnosis were withdrawn from the treatment protocol because of intestinal obstruction. The remission rates by the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were 96% (44/46) and 100% (44/44), respectively. Mean CDAI score (314) on admission decreased to 63 at week 6 (p < 0.0001). Mean CRP level on admission (5.3 mg/dL) decreased to 0.2 (p < 0.0001). Mucosal healing was achieved in 46% (19/41) of cases. CONCLUSION: IPF therapy can induce remission in most patients with CD who are naïve to biologics regardless of age or whether they have a new diagnosis or relapse.",

Literature from plant-based diets (PBDs) epidemiological and clinical trial research was used to inform this review. In addition, data on dietary quality, adherence, and acceptability were evaluated and are presented. Both clinical trials and observational research indicate an advantage to adoption of PBDs for preventing overweight and obesity and promoting weight loss. PBDs may also confer higher levels of diet quality than are observed with other therapeutic diet approaches, with similar levels of adherence and acceptability. Future studies should utilize health behavior theory to inform intervention development and delivery of PBDs studies and new technologies to bring interventions to scale for greater public health impact. Research examining PBDs and weight loss is also needed with more diverse populations, including older adults. Based on the available evidence, PBDs should be considered a viable option for the treatment and prevention of overweight and obesity."

      "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rising worldwide, especially in older adults. Diet and lifestyle, particularly plant-based diets, are effective tools for type 2 diabetes prevention and management. Plant-based diets are eating patterns that emphasize legumes, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds and discourage most or all animal products. Cohort studies strongly support the role of plant-based diets, and food and nutrient components of plant-based diets, in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Evidence from observational and interventional studies demonstrates the benefits of plant-based diets in treating type 2 diabetes and reducing key diabetes-related macrovascular and microvascular complications. Optimal macronutrient ratios for preventing and treating type 2 diabetes are controversial; the focus should instead be on eating patterns and actual foods. However, the evidence does suggest that the type and source of carbohydrate (unrefined versus refined), fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated versus saturated and trans), and protein (plant versus animal) play a major role in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Multiple potential mechanisms underlie the benefits of a plant-based diet in ameliorating insulin resistance, including promotion of a healthy body weight, increases in fiber and phytonutrients, food-microbiome interactions, and decreases in saturated fat, advanced glycation endproducts, nitrosamines, and heme iron."

DESIGN: Experimental randomized controlled community pilot study. SETTING: Three community clinics in MUAs located within San Bernardino County, California. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two randomly assigned Latinos with A1C greater than 6.4: 15 control and 17 experimental. INTERVENTION: Participants completed a 5-week education program. Researchers provided follow-up support for 17 randomly assigned experimental group participants through focus groups held at participating clinics-1, 3, and 6 months posteducation. MEASURES: Changes in fat and fiber consumption were measured using a modified Dietary Screener for Mexican Americans. Self-management was measured through the Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale and Diabetes Quality of Life Measure. ANALYSIS: Baseline characteristics for both groups were analyzed using independent t tests and χ2 tests. A 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to analyze biometric data between baseline and 6 months for both groups. RESULTS: Mean A1C levels decreased from baseline to 6 months for both groups: control, μ1 = 9.57, μ2 = 9.49; experimental, μ1 = 8.53, μ2 = 7.31.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: There is little randomised evidence using a whole food plant-based (WFPB) diet as intervention for elevated body mass index (BMI) or dyslipidaemia. We investigated the effectiveness of a community-based dietary programme. Primary end points: BMI and cholesterol at 6 months (subsequently extended). SUBJECTS: Ages 35-70, from one general practice in Gisborne, New Zealand. Diagnosed with obesity or overweight and at least one of type 2 diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia. Of 65 subjects randomised (control n=32, intervention n=33), 49 (75.4%) completed the study to 6 months. Twenty-three (70%) intervention participants were followed up at 12 months. METHODS: All participants received normal care. Intervention participants attended facilitated meetings twice-weekly for 12 weeks, and followed a non-energy-restricted WFPB diet with vitamin B12 supplementation. RESULTS: At 6 months, mean BMI reduction was greater with the WFPB diet compared with normal care (4.4 vs 0.4, difference: 3.9 kg m-2 (95% confidence interval (CI)±1), P<0.0001). Mean cholesterol reduction was greater with the WFPB diet, but the difference was not significant compared with normal care (0.71 vs 0.26, difference: 0.45 mmol l-1 (95% CI±0.54), P=0.1), unless dropouts were excluded (difference: 0.56 mmol l-1 (95% CI±0.54), P=0.05). Twelve-month mean reductions for the WFPB diet group were 4.2 (±0.8) kg m-2 BMI points and 0.55 (±0.54, P=0.05) mmol l-1 total cholesterol. No serious harms were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This programme led to significant improvements in BMI, cholesterol and other risk factors. To the best of our knowledge, this research has achieved greater weight loss at 6 and 12 months than any other trial that does not limit energy intake or mandate regular exercise.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role that dietary interventions can play in multiple sclerosis (MS) management is of huge interest amongst patients and researchers but data evaluating this is limited. Possible effects of a very-low-fat, plant-based dietary intervention on MS related progression and disease activity as measured by brain imaging and MS related symptoms have not been evaluated in a randomized-controlled trial. Despite use of disease modifying therapies (DMT), poor quality of life (QOL) in MS patients can be a significant problem with fatigue being one of the common disabling symptoms. Effective treatment options for fatigue remain limited. Emerging evidence suggests diet and vascular risk factors including obesity and hyperlipidemia may influence MS disease progression and improve QOL. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate adherence, safety and effects of a very-low-fat, plant-based diet (Diet) on brain MRI, clinical [MS relapses and disability, body mass index (BMI)] and metabolic (blood lipids and insulin) outcomes, QOL [Short Form-36 (SF-36)], and fatigue [Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)], in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). METHODS: This was a randomized-controlled, assessor-blinded, one-year long study with 61 participants assigned to either Diet (N=32) or wait-listed (Control, N=29) group. RESULTS: The mean age (years) [Control-40.9±8.48; Diet-40.8±8.86] and the mean disease duration (years) [Control -5.3±3.86; Diet-5.33±3.63] were comparable between the two groups. There was a slight difference between the two study groups in the baseline mean expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score [Control-2.22±0.90; Diet-2.72±1.05]. Eight subjects withdrew (Diet, N=6; Control, N=2). Adherence to the study diet based on monthly Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was excellent with the diet group showing significant difference in the total fat caloric intake compared to the control group [total fat intake/total calories averaged ~15% (Diet) versus ~40% (Control)]. The two groups showed no differences in brain MRI outcomes, number of MS relapses or disability at 12 months. The diet group showed improvements at six months in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Δ=-11.99mg/dL; p=0.031), total cholesterol (Δ=-13.18mg/dL; p=0.027) and insulin (Δ=-2.82mg/dL; p=0.0067), mean monthly reductions in BMI (Rate=-1.125kg/m2 per month; p<0.001) and fatigue [FSS (Rate=-0.0639 points/month; p=0.0010); MFIS (Rate=-0.233 points/month; p=0.0011)] during the 12-month period. CONCLUSIONS: While a very-low fat, plant-based diet was well adhered to and tolerated, it resulted in no significant improvement on brain MRI, relapse rate or disability as assessed by EDSS scores in subjects with RRMS over one year. The diet group however showed significant improvements in measures of fatigue, BMI and metabolic biomarkers. The study was powered to detect only very large effects on MRI activity so smaller but clinically meaningful effects cannot be excluded. The diet intervention resulted in a beneficial effect on the self-reported outcome of fatigue but these results should be interpreted cautiously as a wait-list control group may not completely control for a placebo effect and there was a baseline imbalance on fatigue scores between the groups. If maintained, the improved lipid profile and BMI could yield long-term vascular health benefits. Longer studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better understand the long-term health benefits of this diet.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is considered one of the fastest growing diseases in Canada, representing a serious public health concern. Thus, clinicians have begun targeting modifiable risk factors to manage type 2 diabetes, including dietary patterns such as a plant-based diets (PBDs). The Canadian Diabetes Association has included PBDs among the recommended dietary patterns to be used in medical nutrition therapy for persons with type 2 diabetes. To support knowledge translation, this review summarizes the current literature relating to PBDs and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, its clinical applications and its acceptability in the management of type 2 diabetes as well as its application in community settings. This comprehensive review seeks to close the literature gap by providing background and rationale to support the use of PBDs as medical nutrition therapy. Within this review is support from large observational studies, which have shown that PBDs were associated with lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes. As well, intervention studies have shown that PBDs were just as effective, if not more effective, than other diabetes diets in improving body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, insulin sensitivity, glycated hemoglobin levels, oxidative stress markers and renovascular markers. Furthermore, patient acceptability was comparable to other diabetes diets, and PBDs reduced the need for diabetes medications. Diabetes education centres in Canada could improve patients' perceptions of PBDs by developing PBD-focused education and support as well as providing individualized counselling sessions addressing barriers to change. The development of more standardized and user-friendly PBD practice guidelines could overcome the disparity in recommendations and, thereby, increase how frequently practitioners recommend PBDs. Based on current published research, PBDs lend support in the management of type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Bacteria that inhabit the epithelium of the animals' digestive tract provide the essential biochemical pathways for fermenting otherwise indigestible dietary fibers, leading to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Of the major SCFAs, butyrate has received particular attention due to its numerous positive effects on the health of the intestinal tract and peripheral tissues. The mechanisms of action of this four-carbon chain organic acid are different; many of these are related to its potent regulatory effect on gene expression since butyrate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that play a predominant role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and cell function. In the present work, we investigated in the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) the effects of butyrate used as a feed additive on fish epigenetics as well as its regulatory role in mucosal protection and immune homeostasis through impact on gene expression. Seven target genes related to inflammatory response and reinforcement of the epithelial defense barrier [tnfα (tumor necrosis factor alpha) il1β, (interleukin 1beta), il-6, il-8, il-10, and muc2 (mucin 2)] and five target genes related to epigenetic modifications [dicer1(double-stranded RNA-specific endoribonuclease), ehmt2 (euchromatic histone-lysine-N-methyltransferase 2), pcgf2 (polycomb group ring finger 2), hdac11 (histone deacetylase-11), and jarid2a (jumonji)] were analyzed in fish intestine and liver. We also investigated the effect of dietary butyrate supplementation on histone acetylation, by performing an immunoblotting analysis on liver core histone extracts. Results of the eight-week-long feeding trial showed no significant differences in weight gain or SGR (specific growth rate) of sea bass that received 0.2% sodium butyrate supplementation in the diet in comparison to control fish that received a diet without Na-butyrate. Dietary butyrate led to a twofold increase in the acetylation level of histone H4 at lysine 8, but showed no effect on the histone H3 at Lys9. Moreover, two different isoforms of histone H3 that might correspond to the H3.1 and H3.2 isoforms previously found in terrestrial animals were separated on the immunoblots. The expression of four (il1 β, il8, irf1, and tnfα) out of seven analyzed genes related to mucosal protection and inflammatory response was significantly different between the two analyzed tissues but only il10 showed differences in expression due to the interaction between tissue and butyrate treatment. In addition, butyrate caused significant changes in vivo in the expression of genes related to epigenetic regulatory mechanisms such as hdac11, ehmt2, and dicer1. Statistical analysis by two-way ANOVA for these genes showed not only significant differences due to the butyrate treatment, but also due to the interaction between tissue and treatment.",

The Atkins diet is known as an extreme low-carbohydrate diet. This diet reduces body weight and has gained widespread popularity. However, the metabolite profiles of such a diet have been shown to be detrimental to colonic health. Therefore, a concern for the long-term health effects of this diet exists. We encountered a case in which ulcerative colitis developed while the patient was following the Atkins diet.A man, 172 cm in height and weighing 72 kg, at age 36 years followed a low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet. His weight decreased to 66 kg as desired. Thereafter he noticed bloody stool. Colonoscopy revealed diffuse inflammation limited to the rectum, and he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. He underwent an educational hospitalization for ulcerative colitis. A plant-based/semivegetarian diet was provided during hospitalization. Bloody stool disappeared during hospitalization and he achieved remission without medication for inflammatory bowel disease.This case indicates that an onset of ulcerative colitis can be an adverse event to a low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet.",

Six-week, prospective randomized open-label study of patients aged 19-70 with osteoarthritis. Participants were randomized to a WFPB (intervention) or continuing current diet (control). Outcomes were assessed by mixed models analysis of participant self-assessed weekly SF-36v2 domain t scores, weekly Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scales, and mean weekly Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain assessment. Mixed models analysis also evaluated pre-post change from baseline level for standard clinical measures: weight, BMI, body temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Results. Forty participants were randomized. Thirty-seven of them, 18 control and 19 intervention, completed the study. The intervention group reported a significantly greater improvement than the control group in SF-36v2 energy/vitality, physical functioning, role physical, and the physical component summary scale. The differences between the intervention and control PGIC scales were statistically significant over time. Intervention group improvement in VAS weekly mean was also significantly greater than that of the control group from week 2 onward. Conclusion. Study results suggest that a whole-foods, plant-based diet significantly improves self-assessed measures of functional status among osteoarthritis patients."

      "abstract": "Studies have found that people following plant-based eating styles, such as vegan or vegetarian diets, often have different demographic characteristics, eating styles, and physical activity (PA) levels than individuals following an omnivorous dietary pattern. There has been no research examining if there are differences in these characteristics among people who are willing to participate in a weight loss intervention using plant-based dietary approaches as compared to a standard reduced calorie approach, which does not exclude food groups. The present study compared baseline characteristics (demographics, dietary intake, eating behaviors (Eating Behavior Inventory), and PA (Paffenbarger Physical Activity Questionnaire)) of participants enrolling in two different 6-month behavioral weight loss studies: the mobile Pounds Off Digitally (mPOD) study, which used a standard reduced calorie dietary approach and the New Dietary Interventions to Enhance the Treatments for weight loss (New DIETs) study, which randomized participants to follow one of five different dietary approaches (vegan, vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian, or omnivorous diets). There were no differences in baseline demographics with the exception of New DIETs participants being older (48.5±8.3years versus 42.9±11.2, P=0.001) and having a higher Body Mass Index (BMI, 35.2±5.3kg/m(2) versus 32.6±4.7kg/m(2), P=0.001) than mPOD participants. In age- and BMI-adjusted models, there were no differences in EBI scores or in any dietary variables, with the exception of vitamin C (85.6±5.9mg/d mPOD versus 63.4±7.4mg/d New DIETs, P=0.02). New DIETs participants reported higher levels of intentional PA/day (180.0±18.1kcal/d) than mPOD participants (108.8±14.4kcal/d, P=0.003), which may have been the result of New DIETs study recommendations to avoid increasing or decreasing PA during the study. The findings of this study demonstrate that using plant-based dietary approaches for weight loss intervention studies does not lead to a population which is significantly different from who enrolls in a standard, behavioral weight loss study using a reduced calorie dietary approach.",

Healthy fish were randomly divided into triplicate groups per dietary treatment and fed with different formulated diets. The results showed that both weight gain, specific growth rate and protein efficiency ratio of all-plant-based diet group were significant higher than those of the control (p < 0.05). In contrast, FCR of all-plant-based diet group was significantly lower than that of the control (p < 0.05). Therefore, all-plant-based diets could not affect the growth performance of blunt snout breams. Compared to the control group, the lysozyme levels in serum and mucus, and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activities in serum and liver decreased significantly (p < 0.05). In contrast, the glutamic-pyruvic transaminase activities in serum and liver increased significantly (p < 0.05). For blunt snout breams fed with all-plant-based diets, the superoxide dismutase activities in mucus, serum and liver as well as catalase activity in serum and liver were decreased significantly (p < 0.05) comparing with that of the control group. But malondialdehyde contents were higher (p < 0.05) in serum and liver than that of control group. The expression of HSC70 mRNA increased significantly (p < 0.05) in blunt snout breams fed with all-plant-based diet, whereas the HSP70 mRNA expression decreased significantly (p < 0.05) when compared with control group. In conclusion, all these results indicated that the application of all-plant-based diet could decrease the anti-stress properties (non-specific immunity, stress resistance and antioxidant ability) and HSP70 mRNA expression in blunt snout breams fingerling. Although all-plant-based diets could not affect the growth performance of blunt snout breams, the application of all-plant-based diet should be discreet in the production practice.",

CONCLUSIONS: Plant-based meal planning is an acceptable and effective strategy that educators can use to improve diabetes management and reduce risk of complications. Studies show that dietary changes that are effective for reducing cardiac risk may also be helpful for management of type 2 diabetes. A low-fat, plant-based diet reduces body weight and improves glycemic control, and has been shown to be remarkably well accepted by patients.",

METHODS: A randomized controlled study design was used to evaluate the Coronary Health Improvement Project. The Project is a heart disease prevention intervention administered in an intensive 40-hour educational course delivered over a 4-week period. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 months. RESULTS: After 6 weeks, participants in the intervention group compared with the control group experienced significant increases in magnesium and daily intake of fruit, vegetables, and grains but significant decreases in dairy servings per day and calcium and vitamin D from food. After 6 months, those in the intervention group showed significant increases in daily intake of fruit, vegetables, and grains and significant decreases in dairy servings per day, daily meat consumption, and protein, phosphorous, calcium, total calcium, and vitamin D from food. Serum calcium levels are the primary determinant of parathyroid hormone (PTH) release, and within 6 weeks, the intervention group's PTH levels were elevated from baseline and significantly different from the control group's PTH levels. At 6 months, urinary type I collagen N-telopeptide (NTx) levels were significantly greater in the intervention group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The Coronary Health Improvement Project increases the intake of important food items but decreases calcium and vitamin D consumption. There is also some evidence of an increase in NTx biomarkers, consistent with increased bone resorption.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost of adopting a plant-based diet. METHODS: Breast cancer survivors randomized to dietary intervention (n=1109) or comparison (n=1145) group; baseline and 12-month data on diet and grocery costs. RESULTS: At baseline, both groups reported similar food costs and dietary intake. At 12 months, only the intervention group changed their diet (vegetable-fruit: 6.3 to 8.9 serv/d.; fiber: 21.6 to 29.8 g/d; fat: 28.2 to 22.3% of E). The intervention change was associated with a significant increase of $1.22/ person/week (multivariate model, P=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: A major change to a plant-based diet was associated with a minimal increase in grocery costs.",

      "abstract": "The Western diet has been associated with prostate cancer incidence as well as risk of disease progression after treatment. Conversely, plant-based diets have been associated with decreased risks. A pilot clinical trial of a 6-month dietary change and stress reduction intervention for asymptomatic, hormonally untreated patients experiencing a consistently rising PSA level, the first sign of recurrence of prostate cancer after surgery or radiation therapy, was conducted to investigate the level of intake of plant-based foods and the relationship between intake and the change in the rate of PSA rise. A pre-post design was employed in which each patient served as his own control. In this multifaceted intervention, patients and their spouses were encouraged to adopt and maintain a plant-based diet. The prestudy rate of PSA rise (from the time of posttreatment recurrence to the start of the study) was ascertained by review of patients' medical records. Dietary assessments were performed and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels ascertained at baseline, prior to the start of intervention, and at 3 and 6 months. Changes in numbers of servings of plant-based food groups were calculated and compared with rates of PSA rise over the corresponding time intervals. Median intake of whole grains increased from 1.7 servings/d at baseline to 6.9 and 5.0 servings/d at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Median intake of vegetables increased from 2.8 servings/d at baseline to 5.0 and 4.8 servings/d at 3 and 6 months, respectively. The rate of PSA rise decreased when comparing the prestudy period (0.059) to the period from 0 to 3 months (-0.002, P < .01) and increased slightly, though not significantly, when comparing the period from 0 to 3 months to the period from 3 to 6 months (0.029, P = .4316). These results provide preliminary evidence that adoption of a plant-based diet is possible to achieve as well as to maintain for several months in patients with recurrent prostate cancer. Changes in the rate of rise in PSA, an indicator of disease progression, were in the opposite direction as changes in the intake of plant-based food groups, raising the provocative possibility that PSA may have inversely tracked intake of these foods and suggesting that adoption of a plant-based diet may have therapeutic potential in the management of this condition.",
