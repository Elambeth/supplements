      "abstract": "Background and objectives Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) is a well-known Ayurvedic herb used as a preventive and curative remedy for various infections and immunity-related conditions. This study aimed to evaluate Guduchi Ghana Vati as a preventive remedy for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infections in a healthy population. Materials and methods An open-labeled, multi-centric, randomized, comparative, interventional, prospective community-based clinical study was conducted on healthy individuals at the community level in five different districts of Rajasthan by the National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA), Jaipur, India. Participants were divided into two groups. One group received Guduchi Ghana Vati as an intervention for 45 days, and the control group did not receive any intervention. Incidences of COVID-19 infection, non-COVID-19 infections, their severity, and hospitalization requirements were assessed. Safety was evaluated through monitoring of adverse reactions. Results Among the 10,022 participants who completed the study, the incidence of COVID-19 infection was found to be lower in those taking Guduchi Ghana Vati compared to the control group; however, the difference was statistically non-significant. The severity of COVID-19 based on the WHO ordinal scale was found to be significantly lower in the Guduchi Ghana Vati group compared to the control group. The number of episodes and severity of non-COVID-19 illness were also significantly lower in participants taking Guduchi Ghana Vati compared to the control group. No major adverse drug reactions were observed. Conclusion Guduchi Ghana Vati has the potential to act as a safe and effective remedy for the prevention of infection and immunity-related conditions, including COVID-19."

      "abstract": "Allergic Rhinitis is an immunological inflammatory response of the nasal mucosa to airborne allergens. Although Allergic Rhinitis is not a life-threatening disease, the symptoms of Allergic Rhinitis can be particularly bothersome and disruptive to a patient's sleep and overall quality of life. The coexistence of other allergic conditions like Asthma is very common. No satisfactory treatment is available in modern medicine for this disease. There is a need to search for satisfactory treatment available in another medical system. We present a case of Allergic Rhinitis that was successfully treated with Ayurvedic medicines. Allergic Rhinitis is characterized by watery nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, nasal mucosal pallor, sneezing, and itching in the eyes, palate, and pharynx. A 18-year-old female patient presented with complaints of sneezing (80-100/day), rhinorrhea (watery discharge from nose), heaviness in the head region, weakness, and loss of concentration hampering daily life activity for one year. The patient's clinical findings and symptoms were suggestive of Allergic Rhinitis, which is of perennial type. According to Ayurveda diagnosis was done as Vata-Kaphaj Pratishyay. Rajanyadi Churna was given to the patient for 15 days along with Guduchi Kwath (∼Guduchi decoction) followed by Shaman Snehapan (∼internal oleation) with Mahatiktak Ghrita. The patient experienced a reduction in all the symptoms after 15 days. Allergy markers i.e. Absolute Eosinophil Count reduced to 360 cells/cu mm from 704 cells/cu mm and eosinophils in CBC reduced to 4.1%. The primary complaint of sneezing was significantly reduced to 3-4 times/day after completing the treatment. Ayurvedic therapeutic interventions other than Nasya (∼Nasal oleation), and Dhoompana (∼medicated smoke) modalities showed encouraging results in managing Allergic Rhinitis in a short duration of time. This approach may be taken into consideration for further treatment and research work for Allergic Rhinitis."

      "abstract": "Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic in India, Ayurvedic medication (Guduchi Ghanavati, GG) was prescribed by Ayurveda physicians for prevention and management. This study aimed to evaluate the prophylactic effect of GG in individuals with moderate to very high risk of SARS-CoV-2. Methods A multicenter, controlled, quasi-experimental, before-and-after study was conducted on individuals at moderate to very high risk of SARS-COV-2 exposure. In the intervention group (n = 15,992), participants received GG 1 g daily for 28 days in conjunction with standard preventive guidelines (SPG), while in the control group (n = 4953), participants were asked to follow SPG only. Outcomes were the incidence of COVID-19, perceived immune status, quality of life, and safety. The perceived immune status was assessed using a brief Likert-scale questionnaire having common immune-related complaints. Results Of the 20,945 enrolled, 20,574 completed the trial (intervention: 15,729, control: 4845). The percentage of participants who reported the incidence of COVID-19 was marginally lower in the GG+SPG group (41, 0.26%) than in the SPG group (16, 0.33%), leading to 21% (95% CI, -40% to 55%) efficacy of GG. However, the decrease in incidence percentage was statistically insignificant due to the trivial incidences reported. The scores of perceived immune status quality of life improved significantly from baseline in the GG+SPG group (p < 0.001) compared to the SPG group. Conclusion GG is safe and improves perception of immune status in individuals at risk of developing SRAS-CoV-2. However, these findings are inadequate to establish that GG lowers the incidence of COVID-19 necessitating to conduct RCTs in high-risk populations. Clinical Trial Registration CTRI/2020/06/025,525."

      "abstract": "Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia [Willd.] Miers) is a flagship rejuvenating herb of Ayurveda with reported anti-diabetic potential. In the present study, different dosage forms of Guduchi stem (growing on neem tree) were developed by adopting Ayurvedic pharmaceutical process of Bhavana (levigation). Guduchi Churna (GC) was subjected to 07 times Bhavana separately with its own extracted juice, decoction and potable water, and dosage forms namely Svarasa Bhavita Guduchi Churna (SBGC), Kwatha Bhavita Guduchi Churna (KBGC), and Jala Bhavita Guduchi Churna (JBGC) were prepared. The present study was aimed to evaluate the role of Bhavana on the potentiation of therapeutic properties of Guduchi. Sequential solvent extracts (5, 10, 15 and 25%) of GC, SBGC, KBGC and JBGC were prepared in different solvents [phosphate buffer, hexane, dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform] and screened for the α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The results revealed that phosphate buffer and DCM extracts of SBGC exhibited strong α-amylase inhibitory potential (>80% inhibition at 25% concentration) followed by KBGC, JBGC and GC with reference to the standard acarbose. In α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, maximum inhibition was observed in DCM and chloroform extracts of SBGC (>85% inhibition at 25% concentration), followed by KBGC (>80% inhibition at 25% concentration), JBGC and GC. In vivo anti-hyperglycemic studies were carried out by oral glucose tolerance test in Swiss albino mice. Test drugs (JBGC, KBGC, SBGC) treated groups showed marginal decrease of blood glucose levels in normo glycemic mice. However, the blood glucose level in test drug JBGC, KBGC and SBGC treated groups was still within normal range in overnight fasted mice. In oral glucose tolerance test, among all dosage forms SBGC (51.08%) produced pronounced anti-hyperglycemic effect followed by KBGC (42.57%) at a dose of 520 mg/kg. The GC, JBGC, KBGC and SBGC samples were also standardized using berberine (a well established anti-diabetic compound) as a marker compound by HPTLC fingerprint analysis. Findings of the present study indicate that SBGC and KBGC can be used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and gives supporting evidence to Ayurvedic claims that the Bhavana process has pharmaceutico-therapeutic significance in Ayurvedic drug development."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rasamanikya (RM) and Guduchi Ghana (GG) are well-known formulations for treating skin disorders in Ayurveda. The drug RM is prepared from Shuddha Haratala (processed orpiment) as a single ingredient. In the present study, RM was prepared from the Haratala, which was Shodhita, with two different media, viz., Kushmanda Swarasa and Churnodaka. In the classics, the preparation of RM is mentioned in the Kushmanda Shodhita Haratala. However, the availability and cost of Kushmanda are the main points of concern in the present era. Shodhana of Haratala by Churnodaka is more cost-effective than Kushmanda Swarasa. AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the comparative efficacy of RM prepared by Churnodaka Shodhita Haratala (CSHRM) and RM prepared by Kushmanda Shodhita Haratala (KSHRM) with GG in Ekakustha (psoriasis). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a randomized double-blind study involving 76 patients with Ekakushtha that were randomly divided into two groups. Patients registered in group A (n = 37) were treated with CSHRM with GG (125 mg + 375 mg) and group B (n = 36) with KSHRM with GG (125 mg + 375 mg) for 8 weeks. The Wilcoxon signed rank test and paired t-test were applied to evaluate the effect of therapy in the individual group for subjective criteria like the PASI score, Matsyashakalopamam (looks like the scales of a fish), Rukshata (dryness), Aswedanam (anhydrosis), Daha (burning), Strava (discharge), Unnati (raised patches), Kandu (itching), Mahavastu (broad-based), and Vaivarnya (discoloration), while the comparison of results between the groups for the same was done by applying the Coefficient of Variation (CV). RESULT: CSHRM with GG showed better results in all signs and symptoms except Matsyaskalopamam, Aswedanam, Strava, Mahavastu, Nindra and DLQI in terms of the coefficient of variation. In both groups, statistically highly significant (P > 0.001) improvement was found in the signs and symptoms of Ekakushtha. However, the difference between the groups was statistically nonsignificant. CONCLUSION: Rasamanikya prepared with both media Shodhita Haratala along with Guduchi Ghana was discovered to be a safe and effective psoriasis treatment."

METHODOLOGY: A nonrandomized before and after trial for 21 days of intervention was performed involving 17 participants. Plaque index, gingival index were recorded and saliva samples were collected at baseline, 13th day and 22nd day. Repeated measures ANOVA test was performed to compare the before and after results of the clinical parameters, i.e. score of plaque index and gingival index. Freidman's test was applied for comparison between the three intervals (for microbiological evaluation of colony counts). RESULTS: There was statistically significant reduction inplaque score, gingival score, and colony forming units of gram negative organisms and S. mutans from baseline to 22nd day (P = 0.001). There was no significant reduction with gram positive organisms. CONCLUSION: This clinico-microbiological study concluded that twice rinsing of T.cordifolia decoction as mouth rinse in adjunct to scaling and routine brushing of teeth for 21 days shows anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis, and antimicrobial action against gram negative organisms and S. mutans.",

      "abstract": "Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi Sawras) though has been clearly demonstrated in literature for its hypolipidemic and anti-alcoholism properties but its anti-hyperlipidemia mechanistic approach is still missing. Moreover, its direct implication with alcohol induced hyperlipidemia has also not been reported till date. In order to explore the answers of these questions, phytochemicals of Tinospora cordifolia water extract \"Guduchi Sawras\" (GS) was analyzed using HPLC-Q-TOF-MS. On the basis of relative peak volumes 110 compounds were selected and identified in GS. Besides that, protein targets of most abundant compounds present in GS were fetched from ChEMBL and protein interaction network (PIN) was constructed. GO enrichment analysis showed that GS targets various pathways including dopamine metabolism, cAMP-dependent signaling pathway, and glycolytic process. Biological processes obtained via PIN were correlated with hyperlipidemia markers and dopamine metabolism in moderate alcohol consumers (n=25) and healthy volunteers (n=27) of age 41±3.8years. Metabolic analysis demonstrated the increased serotonin (1.9-fold) and decreased dopamine (-2.3-fold) levels in alcoholics. Further data analysis revealed a significant increase in urinary BCAAs (>2.0-fold), pantothenic acid (1.8-fold), carnitines (>2-fold) levels, and decrease in PPARα activation markers levels i.e. nicotinamide-1-oxide (-1.7-fold), and N-methylnicotinamide (-1.6-fold) in alcoholics. Biochemical analysis showed the increased AST/ALT ratio (1.91), along with triglycerides (20%), and MDA (34%) and GSH (56%) levels in alcoholics. GS treatment significantly reverted the most of the discussed metabolites levels (p<0.05) and enzymes activities (p<0.05) in alcoholics. The data depict that moderate chronic alcohol consumption lead to hyperlipidemia and oxidative burden; whereas GS treatment ameliorates hyperlipidemia by decreasing oxidative stress, activating PPARα, CREB and SREBP-1 through stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors mediated signalling molecules i.e. cAMP and protein kinase A.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Results of an exploratory trial suggested activity trends of Zingiber officinale-Tinopsora cordifolia (platform combination)-based formulations in the treatment of Osteoarthritis (OA) Knees. These formulations were \"platform combination+Withania somnifera+Tribulus terrestris\" (formulation B) and \"platform combination+Emblica officinale\" (formulation C). This paper reports safety of these formulations when used in higher doses (1.5-2 times) along with Sallaki Guggul and Bhallataka Parpati (a Semecarpus anacardium preparation). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-two patients with symptomatic OA knees were enrolled in a 6 weeks investigator blind, randomized parallel efficacy 4-arm multicenter drug trial. The 4 arms were (I) formulation B, 2 t.i.d.; (II) formulation B, 2 q.i.d.; (III) platform combination+Sallaki Guggul; (IV) Bhallataka Parpati+formulation C. A detailed enquiry was carried out for adverse events (AE) and drug toxicity as per a priori check list and volunteered information. Laboratory evaluation included detailed hematology and metabolic parameters. Patients were examined at baseline, first and fourth weeks, and on completion. Standard statistical program (SPSS version 12.5) was used for analysis. RESULTS: None of the patients reported serious AE or withdrew due to any drug-related toxicity. Mild gut-related (mostly epigastric burning) AE was reported. A mild increase in liver enzymes [serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)] without any other hepatic abnormality was reported in 2 patients (group IV). Other laboratory parameters remained normal. The mean improvement in active pain visual analog scale (1.4, CI 0.5-2.22), WOMAC (functional activity questionnaire) pain score (1.37, CI 0.22-2.5), and urinary C-TAX (cartilage collagen breakdown product) assay was maximum (NS) in group IV. Lower dose group I showed numerically superior improvement compared with higher dose group II. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that despite higher doses, standardized Ayurvedic formulations demonstrated a good safety profile. An improved efficacy and likely chondroprotective effect was shown by group IV intervention. A confirmatory drug trial with adequate power and sample size was planned based on the learning from this trial."

      "abstract": "It is believed that the enhanced microbicidal and tumoricidal capability of activated macrophages is related to the remarkable increase in the production of oxygen metabolites. Both the production of H2O2 and the oxidation of NAD(P)H are directly dependent upon NAD(P)H-oxidase. It has been established that the respiratory burst is due to activation of NAD(P)H-oxidase localised in the plasmalemma. Myeloperoxidase is believed to be involved in augmenting the cytotoxic activity of H2O2. It was observed that the macrophage cell line J774A.1 when treated with Tinospora cordifolia (guduchi) and LPS showed enhanced NADH-oxidase, NADPH-oxidase and myeloperoxidase production as compared to macrophages treated with medium alone. The direct drug treatment to J774A cells showed activation as assessed by biochemical assays. These results suggest that high NADH-oxidase, NADPH-oxidase and myeloperoxidase activities may account for tumoricidal and microbicidal properties via macrophage activation.",

The surviving fraction (SF) was reduced to 0.52 after 4 hours of TCE treatment; thereafter, clonogenecity of HeLa cells declined negligibly with treatment duration up to 6 hours posttreatment. Exposure of HeLa cells to different doses of γ-radiation resulted in a dose-dependent decline in the viability of HeLa cells, whereas treatment of HeLa cells with various doses of TCE further decreased the cell viability depending not only on the irradiation dose but also on the concentration of TCE. Treatment of HeLa cells with various doses of TCE caused a significant decline in cell viability after exposure to 1 to 4 Gy γ-radiation. The increase in TCE concentration before irradiation caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the SF, and a lowest SF was observed for 4 μg/mL TCE for all exposure doses. HeLa cells treated with TCE showed an increase in lactate dehydrogenase and decrease in glutathioneS-transferase activity at all postirradiation times. Lipid peroxidation increased up to 4 hours postirradiation and declined gradually up to 12 hours postirradiation.",

      "abstract": "The radiosensitizing activity of dichloromethane extract of guduchi [Tinospora cordifolia (WILLD.) MIERS ex HOOK. F. & THOMS. Family: Menispermaceae (TCE)] in the mice transplanted with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) was investigated. The EAC mice received 0, 25, 30, 40, 50 or 100 mg/kg b.wt. TCE 1 h before exposure to 6 Gy hemi-body gamma-radiation and then once daily for another eight consecutive days after irradiation. The EAC mice receiving TCE for the above regimen showed a dose-dependent elevation in tumor-free survival; the highest radiosensitizing activity was observed at 30 mg/kg b. wt. TCE. Treatment of animals with 30 mg/kg b. wt. TCE, 1 h before exposure to 6 Gy of hemi-body gamma irradiation and subsequently once daily for another six consecutive days post-irradiation increased the life span of EAC mice. This is evident by more number of long-term survivors (LTS) as well as survivors beyond 120 days when compared to the group of animals that received TCE after irradiation for six consecutive days. Treatment modality was also altered to assess the radiosensitizing effect of TCE before and after irradiation. Evaluation of glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and lipid peroxidation (LPx) in mice treated with TCE 1 h before irradiation and subsequently once daily for another six days showed a significant decline in GSH up to 14 h and GST up to 24 h accompanied by a significant elevation in LPx at 12 h post-irradiation. The radiosensitization of TCE may be due to depletion of glutathione and glutathione-S-transferase, accompanied by elevated levels of lipid peroxidation and DNA damage of tumor cells. Since Tinospora cordifolia is being used in India for treatment of various ailments, it may offer an alternative treatment strategy for cancer in combination with gamma radiation.",

      "abstract": "Extracts of Tinospora cordifolia (TCE) have been shown to possess anti-tumor properties, but the mechanism of the anti-tumor function of TCE is poorly understood. This investigation elucidates the possible mechanism underlying the cytotoxic effects of dichlormethane extracts of TCE, after selecting optimal duration and concentration for treatment. HeLa cells were exposed to various concentrations of TCE, which has resulted in a concentration-dependent decline in the clonogenicity, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and a concentration-dependent increase in lipid peroxidation (TBARS) with a peak at 4 h and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release with a peak at 2 h. Our results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of TCE may be due to lipid peroxidation and release of LDH and decline in GST."

Family: Menispermaceae (TCE)] in the mice transplanted with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) was investigated. The EAC mice receiving 25, 30, 40, 50 and 100 mg/kg, TCE showed a dose dependent elevation in tumor-free survival and a highest number of survivors were observed at 50 mg/kg TCE, which was considered as an optimum dose for its neoplastic action. The average survival time (AST) and median survival time (MST) for this dose were approximately 56 and 55 d, respectively when compared with 19 d of non-drug treated controls. Administration of 50 mg/kg TCE resulted in 100% long-term survivors (up to 90 d). An attempt was also made to evaluate the effectiveness of TCE in the various stages of tumor development, where 50 mg/kg TCE was administered intraperitoneally after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 d of tumor inoculation and these days have been arbitrarily designated as stage I, II, III, IV or V, respectively for reasons of clarity. The greatest anticancer activity was recorded for stage I, II and III where number of long term survivors (LTS) was approximately 33, 25 and 17%, respectively. However, treatment of mice at stage IV and V did not increase LTS, despite an increase in AST and MST. The EAC mice receiving 50 mg/kg TCE showed a time dependent depletion in the glutathione (GSH) activity up to 12 h post-treatment and marginal elevation thereafter. This depletion in GSH was accompanied by a drastic elevation in lipid peroxidation (LPx) and a maximum elevation in LPx was observed at 6 h that declined gradually thereafter. TCE exerted cytotoxic effect on tumor cells by reducing the GSH concentration and increase in LPx simultaneously.",

The effects of methanol and aqueous extracts were almost identical. However, methylene chloride extract enhanced the cell killing effect by 2.8- and 6.8-fold when compared either to methanol or aqueous extract at 50 and 100 microg/ml, respectively. Conversely, the frequency of micronuclei increased in a concentration-dependent manner in guduchi-treated groups and this increase in the frequency of micronuclei was significantly higher than the non-drug-treated control cultures and also with respect to 5 microg/ml guduchi extract-treated cultures, at the rest of the concentrations evaluated. Furthermore, the micronuclei formation was higher in the methylene chloride extract-treated group than in the other two groups. The dose response relationship for all three extracts evaluated was linear quadratic. The effect of guduchi extracts was comparable or better than doxorubicin treatment. The micronuclei induction was correlated with the surviving fraction of cells and the correlation between cell survival and micronuclei induction was found to be linear quadratic. Our results demonstrate that guduchi killed the cells very effectively in vitro and deserves attention as an antineoplastic agent.",
