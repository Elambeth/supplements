      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) significantly impairs individuals' sensorimotor functions, hindering daily activities. Current therapeutic options often demonstrate limited efficacy and lead to undesirable side effects. Emerging research highlights the potential of anthocyanins, especially pelargonidin, which possess neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties beneficial for neurological conditions. PURPOSE: This study sought to explore the impact of intrathecal administration of pelargonidin on the recovery of sensory-motor functions and associated disorders in a rat model of SCI through neuroprotective effects and regulating inflammatory/oxidative stress mediators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 35 male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: sham, SCI, and three treatment groups receiving different intrathecal concentrations of pelargonidin (1, 2, and 4 mM) once on day 0 after surgery/injury. Weight changes were assessed and behavioral analyses were done, including hot plate tests, acetone drop tests, von Frey tests, inclined plane tests, as well as Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores, weekly up to day 28 post-injury. On day 28, serum levels of nitrite, catalase, and glutathione as well as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) assays and histological evaluations were done. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Pelargonidin significantly attenuated neuropathic pain, improved motor performance, and reduced weight loss in rats with SCI. Biochemical assays demonstrated increased serum catalase/glutathione level, and MMP2 activity, while decreased serum nitrite level and MMP9 activity. Histological analyses showed an enhancement in the number of motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord after treatment with pelargonidin, highlighting its neuroprotective and neurogenic effects. CONCLUSION: Pelargonidin makes substantial therapeutic benefits following SCI by accelerating sensorimotor recovery. This effect is likely due to its strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties."

      "abstract": "In this study, network pharmacology analysis revealed that strawberry anthocyanins mainly interfered with lipid metabolism and nerve-related signaling pathways. Pelargonidin-3-glucoside (Pg3G), one of the main anthocyanins in strawberry, was screened as the most effective anthocyanin for attenuating excess lipid accumulation. Moreover, Pg3G decreased lipid levels, relieved oxidative stress, and restored abnormal behavioral activities in Caenorhabditis elegans under oleic acid (OA) exposure. Meanwhile, Pg3G increased the expression of HSP-6 and HSP-60 proteins and activated the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), while beneficial effects of Pg3G were impaired in the ubl-5 knockout strain, suggesting that ubl-5 may be a key target for improving OA-induced neurotoxicity. Expressions of neurotransmitter transmission-related genes showed great correlations with genes involved in lipid metabolism and UPRmt, further explaining the underlying mechanism of Pg3G in neuroprotection. Our findings emphasize the key role of UPRmt in alleviating OA-induced neurotoxicity of Pg3G, providing a theoretical basis for the research and development of strawberry anthocyanins as a dietary supplement for lipid reduction and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer has the worst prognosis with an average 5-year survival rate of only 10%-20%. Lung cancer has the highest prevalence rate and a second most common cause of cancer-associated mortalities worldwide. The present study was planned to explore the anticancer effects of pelargonidin against the lung cancer A549 cells via analyzing oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. The viability of both control and pelargonidin-treated A549 cells was analyzed using the MTT cytotoxicity assay at different time periods. The levels of endogenous ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and apoptosis were assessed using corresponding fluorescent staining assays. The levels of oxidative stress biomarkers, including TBARS, SOD, CAT, and GSH, in the cell lysates of control and pelargonidin-treated A549 cells were examined using the assay kits. The pelargonidin treatment substantially suppressed the A549 cell growth. Further, pelargonidin promoted the ROS production and depleted the Δψm levels in the A549 cells. The fluorescent staining assays witnessed the occurrence of increased apoptosis in the pelargonidin-treated A549 cells. The pelargonidin also boosted the TBARS and reduced the antioxidant levels thereby promoted the oxidative stress-regulated apoptosis in the A549 cells. In summary, the findings' results of the current study demonstrated an anticancer activity of pelargonidin on A549 cells. The pelargonidin treatment substantially decreased the growth and encouraged the oxidative stress-regulated apoptosis in A549 cells. Therefore, it was evident that the pelargonidin could be employed as an effective anticancer candidate to treat the lung cancer.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a worldwide public health issue, but a widely accepted therapy is still lacking until now. Anthocyanins are natural flavonoid compounds that possess various bioactivities, but their applications are limited due to their low bioavailability and stability. Acylated anthocyanins are reported to show higher stability, whereas their effects on NAFLD are still unclear. Herein, pelargonidin-3-O-(6''-acetyl)-glucoside (Ace Pg3G) was found to dose-dependently reduce intracellular lipid droplets and triglycerides, and improve cellular oxidative stress that accompanied lipid deposition. Besides, Ace Pg3G was proved to activate AMPK phosphorylation, thus stimulating AMPK-mediated lysosome-autophagy pathway to eliminate overloaded lipid. Further study unveiled that Ace Pg3G regulated genes related to lipid metabolism downstream of AMPK to inhibit lipid synthesis and accelerate lipid oxidation. Overall, this study provided the first evidence, to our best knowledge, that Ace Pg3G ameliorated free fatty acid-induced lipid deposition in hepatocytes through regulating AMPK-mediated autophagy pathways and redox state.",

      "abstract": "Acrolein, a common environmental pollutant, is linked to the development of cardiovascular inflammatory diseases. Pelargonidin is a natural compound with anti-inflammation activity. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of pelargonidin on inflammation induced by acrolein in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). MTT assay was utilized for assessing cell viability in HUVECs. LDH release in HUVECs was measured using the LDH kit. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of p-p65, p65 and COX-2. Inflammation was evaluated through determining the levels of PGE2, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in HUVECs after treatment. COX-2 mRNA expression and COX-2 content were examined using RT-qPCR and a human COX-2 ELISA kit, respectively. Acrolein treatment at 50 μM resulted in a 45% decrease in the viability and an increase in LDH release (2.2-fold) in HUVECs. Pelargonidin at 5, 10, 20, and 40 μM alleviated acrolein-caused inhibitory effect on cell viability (increased to 1.3-, 1.5-, 1.8-, and 1.9-fold, respectively, compared to acrolein treatment group) and promoting effect on LDH release (decreased to 82%, 75%, 62%, and 58%, respectively, compared to acrolein treatment group) in HUVECs. Moreover, pelargonidin or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC; an NF-κB pathway inhibitor) inhibited acrolein-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway. Acrolein elevated the levels of PGE2, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α (from 40.2, 27.3, 67.2, 29.0, 24.8 pg/mL in control group to 224.0, 167.3, 618.3, 104.6, and 275.1 pg/mL in acrolein treatment group, respectively), which were retarded after pelargonidin (decreased to 134.8, 82.3, 246.2, 70.2, and 120.8 pg/mL in acrolein + pelargonidin treatment group) or PDTC (decreased to 107.9, 80.1, 214.6, 64.0, and 96.6 pg/mL in acrolein + PDTC treatment group) treatment in HUVECs. Pelargonidin inactivated the NF-κB pathway to reduce acrolein-induced COX-2 expression. Furthermore, pelargonidin relieved acrolein-triggered inflammation through decreasing COX-2 expression by inactivating the NF-κB pathway in HUVECs. In conclusion, pelargonidin could protect against acrolein-triggered inflammation in HUVECs through attenuating COX-2 expression by inactivating the NF-κB pathway.",

      "abstract": "Pelargonidin (PG), a derivative of anthocyanins, has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Herein, the protective effect and the mechanism of PG in counteract the osteoarthritis (OA) progression were needed to further evaluate. In the current study, C57BL/6 mice was induced by destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM) surgery to establish the OA model. Primary chondrocytes were acquired from the knee cartilage of newborn mice. Then, PG was administrated to OA mice and IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes to evaluate its protective effects, respectively. Results uncovered that no conspicuous cytotoxic effects were observed when chondrocytes were treated with PG at a concentration lower than 40 μM for 24-72 h. Thus, 10 μM, 20 μM, and 40 μM PG were chosen for subsequent experiments in vitro. Then, we observed that 10, 20, and 40 μM PG reduced the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2 and iNOS in chondrocytes. In line, PG inhibited the IL-1β-induced ECM catabolism in chondrocytes, as evidenced by deepening toluidine blue staining, increased expression of Collagen II, and decreased expressions of ADAMTS5 and MMP13. Moreover, PG also reduced the IL-1β-stimulated p-p65 overexpression and nuclear translocation of p65 in chondrocytes. In vivo, Safranin O/Fast green and HE staining showed that articular cartilage surface morphology was basically smooth and complete after PG treatment for 8 weeks. Similarly, OARSI scores and MMP13 expression were apparently decreased, whereas Aggrecan expression was elevated in PG-treated mice 8 weeks after DMM surgery. In conclusion, PG can effectively ameliorate inflammatory reactions and cartilage degeneration via suppressing the NF-κB pathway, thereby restraining the OA progression.",

      "abstract": "Among luminal types of breast cancers, ER + breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer globally. ER + breast cancer is commonly treated with SERM drugs that block ER to prevent ER-mediated cancerous growth. Our previous computational screening found pelargonidin (PG) can inhibit ER-signaling with potent bioactivity and satisfactory toxicological features. The present study explored the anti-tumoral prospect of PG against DMBA-induced ER + murine mammary carcinogenesis. The female BALB/c mice were divided into control (A) and DMBA-exposed groups. Following tumor appearance, the DMBA-exposed group was divided into five groups: tumor control, PG-treated (Groups P25, P50, and P100), and tamoxifen-treated (TAM). The results indicated that PG-treatment dose-dependently reduced the mean tumor volume, reinstated body weight loss, and enhanced the percentage survival of tumor-bearing mice. In addition, we recorded a significant reduction in LPO, total cholesterol, and triglycerides and a surge in the activity of antioxidases and phase II detoxifying enzymes in PG-treated animals. PG also dose-dependently increased the serum level of unbound estradiol, an indicator of competitive ER binding by an ER agonist/antagonist. These data suggest that pelargonidin has potent anticancer potential against the animal model of ER + breast cancer that matches the efficiency of tamoxifen with conceivably fewer side effects.",

      "abstract": "Pelargonidin has attracted much attention in many cancers. Whether the growth of glioma inhibited by pelargonidin is related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is unknown. To examine this, we performed both in vivo and in vitro studies. Twenty-four hours after inoculation, C6 cells received various treatments: CCK8, transwell, flow cytometry, and Western blot were performed. The cell supernatant was collected in order to pretreat HUVEC cells, and tube formation assay was performed. An in situ glioma rat model was constructed and administrated treatment according to its group. After 14 days, the brains were obtained for TUNEL assay, immunohistochemical staining, and Western blot. In vitro studies demonstrated that pelargonidin inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of C6 cells, and promoted apoptosis of C6 cells. Additionally, pelargonidin could inhibit tube formation of HUVECs. We also detected the proteins in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and the results indicated that pelargonidin inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, PI3K, and mTOR, and downregulated VEGF protein. In vivo glioma models were successfully built, and pelargonidin could increase the survival rate of rat, and pathological staining results indicated that pelargonidin increased TUNELpositive cells and decreased micro-vessel density (MVD) through PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Pelargonidin could reduce the relative expression of MMP2, MMP9, N-cadherin, and VEGF proteins, and inhibit the PI3K/AKT/ mTOR pathway. Pelargonidin inhibited the vascularization and metastasis of glioma by blocking the PI3K/ AKT/mTOR pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Targeting the neuronal mitochondria as a possible intervention to guard against neurodegenerative disorder progression has been investigated in the current work via the administration of pelargonidin (PEL) to rats intoxicated by the mitochondrial toxin reserpine. The main criteria for choosing PEL were its reported antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities. METHODS: Male albino Wistar rats were randomized into five experimental groups; normal control, reserpinized to induce mitochondrial failure, standard PARP-1-inhibitor 1,5-isoquinolinediol (DIQ)-treated reserpinized, PEL-treated reserpinized, and GSK-3β inhibitor (AR-A 014418) -treated reserpinized. RESULTS: PEL administration reversed the reserpine-induced abnormal behaviors marked by decreased catalepsy time. In addition, PEL restored brain glutathione with a reduction in nitric oxide content as compared to the reserpine-challenged group. Meanwhile, it improved neuronal mitochondrial function by the elevation of complex I activity associated with a low ADP/ATP ratio. Likely through its anti-inflammatory effect, PEL reduced the elevation of serum interleukin-1ß level and inhibited serum lactate dehydrogenase activity. These findings are aligned with the reduced expression of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 proteins, indicating PEL's suppressive effect on the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Those biochemical findings were confirmed through comparable histopathological tissue examination among the experimental groups. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, PEL is a promising candidate for future use in the management of mitochondria-associated neuronal complications via controlling the ongoing inflammatory and degeneration cascades.",

Meanwhile, the fluorescence of tyrosinase was quenched statically by PG, and accompanied by non-radiative energy transfer. The three-dimensional (3-D) fluorescence, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and circular dichroism spectroscopies (CD) indicated that PG decreased the hydrophobicity of the micro-environment around tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr), which resulted in the conformational change of tyrosinase. In addition, fluorescence and molecular docking analysis indicated that PG bound to tyrosinase via hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and van der Waals force (vdW force). We herein recommended that PG might be a potential candidate drug for the treatment of melanin-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with impaired cognitive skills and learning and memory dysfunctions.  It has been suggested that pelargonidin (PG), as an antioxidant agent, has a neuroprotective effect. PG could prevent damaging effects of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition. The aim of this study was to determine the chronic effect of PG on hippocampal neurons and memory processes in a rat model of AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight male adult rats were divided into sham, AD, AD+PG (5 μg, intracerebroventricular), and PG (5 μg, intracerebroventricular) groups. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Aβ peptides (6 μg) was done using stereotaxic surgery. ICV administration of PG or saline was performed daily for 28 consecutive days. Behavioral analysis was performed using the novel object recognition (NOR) and passive avoidance tests. Neuronal apoptosis was detected using TUNEL assay in the hippocampus. RESULTS: The ICV injection of Aβ reduced step-through latency and discrimination index in behavioral tests (p<0.001). Aβ increased the number of apoptotic neurons (p<0.001). PG treatment decreased the time spent in the dark compartment and neuronal apoptosis in the AD+PG rats (p<0.001). PG increased the discrimination index in the NOR test (p<0.001). Although PG did not change behavioral variables, it decreased cell death in the PG group. CONCLUSION: PG attenuated neuronal apoptosis and improved cognition and memory deficiency in AD rats. The protective effect of PG against Aβ may be due to its anti-apoptotic property. It is suggested that PG can be useful to treat AD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality remain high for ischemic stroke victims, and at present these patients lack effective neuroprotective agents, which improve the cure rate. In recent years, studies have shown that pelargonidin has many biological actions. However, few studies are available regarding the pelargonidin treatment of cerebral ischemia. METHODS: The rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established to investigate the neuroprotective effect of pelargonidin on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Reperfusion was performed 2 h after ischemia; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining were used to measure the volume of cerebral ischemia. Both modified neurological severity scores (mNSSs) and Morris water maze test were used to assess the neurological functions. ELISA was applied to determine the levels of TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, MDA, and SOD. The expression of Nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) protein in brain tissue was measured by immunofluorescence and Western blot assays. RESULTS: The results showed that pelargonidin could effectively reduce the volume of cerebral ischemia and improve the neurological function in MCAO rats, thereby improving memory and learning ability. With the corresponding decreases in the expression of TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-6, and MDA, the level of IL-10 and SOD increased and also promoted the nuclear metastasis of Nrf2 and the expression of HO-1 in ischemic brain tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that pelargonidin ameliorated neurological function deficits in MCAO rats, and its potential mechanism of action was associated with overexpression of the Nrf2/HO-1-signaling pathway. This study will provide a new approach to treat cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury."

      "abstract": "Pelargonidin is a natural compound that exists widely in fruits, and exerts antioxidant, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic, and anti-diabetic activities. However, there have not been any studies concerning its anti-obesity potential to date. Therefore, we evaluated the anti-obesity potential of pelargonidin via inhibition of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. The cellular oil droplet content was decreased to 68.14%, 56.75%, and 48.39% and triglyceride accumulation decreased to 74.53%, 61.54%, and 47.86% after incubation with 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM pelargonidin, respectively, when compared with DMSO group. Furthermore, pelargonidin treatment led to decrease in glucose consumption. Western blot assay illustrated that the expression of PPAR-γ was suppressed to 63.25%, 47.52%, and 21.23% after incubation with 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM pelargonidin when compared with DMSO group. Then, we measured the expression of some target proteins of PPAR-γ, and found that pelargonidin decreased the expressions of HMGCR, LPL, Glut4, and A-FABP. Besides, the result of Luciferase Reporter Assay indicated that pelargonidin inhibited PPAR-γ transcription activity. These results indicated that pelargonidin exerts anti-adipogenic activity in 3T3-L1 cells through inhibition of PPAR-γ signaling pathway, and pelargonidin could be used as a potential anti-obesity agent.",

METHODS: We tested P3G-enriched strawberry in two models of chronic inflammation in rats, chronic IBD induced by 0.5% dextran sodium sulphate in the drinking water for 12 weeks (D) and metabolic syndrome induced by a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (H) for 16 weeks. P3G-enriched strawberry was added to the diet for the final 6 weeks in IBD rats (DP) or 8 weeks in H rats (HP) to provide a dose of 8 mg P3G/kg/day. RESULTS: D rats had marked diarrhoea, bloody stools, erosion of mucosal epithelium, crypt atrophy, loss of villi and goblet cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration. These symptoms were reversed by P3G with healthy stools and mucosal lining of ileum and colon including increased villi, crypts and goblet cells and reduced inflammation. H rats developed hypertension, dyslipidaemia, central obesity, increased ventricular stiffness, cardiac and liver inflammation, and steatosis. P3G treatment in H rats improved systolic blood pressure, ventricular stiffness, and cardiac and liver structure, and reduced abdominal fat, abdominal circumference and body weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that dietary P3G decreased inflammation to decrease the symptoms of IBD, and to improve cardiovascular, liver and metabolic functions in metabolic syndrome.",

In this study, we tested protective capability of a phytochemical pelargonidin-loaded non-toxic, biodegradable poly-lactide-co-glycolide nano-particles (NPG) against toxicity induced by a pesticide cypermethrin (CM) in a fish model (Oreochromis mossambica) in vivo and also in L6 muscle cell line, in vitro. First we assessed potential sustainable release of nanoparticles following oral administration of NPG to fish, their ability to cross sub-cellular membranes in several tissues and efficacy to cross blood-brain-barrier. Next, protective ability of NPG, if any, against CM in fish was evaluated deploying parameters like % cell viability, DNA damage in muscle cells and modulation of anti-oxidative-enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase and lipid peroxidase. Modulation of reactive oxygen species generation, nuclear condensation and alteration in stress related protein signalling cascade were assessed in L6 cells. Results revealed that NPG had nano-size range (~10-12 nm) and negative zeta potential (-17 mV). Bioavailability and distribution of NPG could be followed by spectrophotometric absorbance of pelargonidin at 293 nm from 6 h onward till 24 h in all important tissues including the brain. Thus, 0.5 mg/g b.w. NPG could demonstrate protective ability in CM-intoxicated fish muscle cells in respect of % cell viability, DNA damage and stress related enzymes. Similar alterations could also be found in signalling protein cascade in L6 cells in response to treatment of 5 μg/ml NPG against CM-induced toxicity and depletion of overall ROS generation and nuclear condensation. Therefore, NPG could be used as a potential drug in management of pesticide toxicity in cultured edible fish.",

Herein, the hyperglycemia-lowering effect of Pg3G derived from wild raspberry was investigated on high-glucose/high-fat (HG+HF)-induced hepatocytes and db/db diabetic mice. Our results indicated that Pg3G promoted glucose uptake in HG+HF-induced hepatocytes. Moreover, Pg3G induced autophagy, whereas autophagy inhibitors blocked the hypoglycemic effect of Pg3G. Transcriptional factor EB (TFEB) was found to be linked to Pg3G-induced autophagy. In vivo study showed that Pg3G treatment contributed to the improvement of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and induction of autophagy. Furthermore, Pg3G not only modified the gut microbiota composition, as indicated by an increased abundance of Prevotella, and elevated Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, but also strengthened the intestinal barrier integrity. This study unveils a novel mechanism that Pg3G attenuates hyperglycemia through inducing autophagy and modulating gut microbiota, which implicates a potential nutritional intervention strategy for T2D.",

      "abstract": "Pelargonidin, a well-known natural anthocyanidin found in berries strawberries, blueberries, red radishes and other natural foods, has been found to possess health beneficial effects including anti-cancer effect. Herein, we investigated the effect of pelargonidin on cellular transformation in mouse skin epidermal JB6 (JB6 P+) cells induced by tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Pelargonidin treatment significantly decreased colony formation and suppressed cell viability of JB6 P+ cells. Pelargonidin also induced the anti-oxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase activation in HepG2-C8 cells overexpressing the ARE-luciferase reporter. Knockdown of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in shNrf2 JB6 P+ cells enhanced TPA-induced colony formation and attenuated pelargonidin's blocking effect. Pelargonidin reduced the protein levels of genes encoding methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Importantly, pelargonidin decreased the DNA methylation in the Nrf2 promoter region of JB6 P+ cells and increased Nrf2 downstream target genes expression, such as NAD(P)H/quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), involved in cellular protection. In summary, our results showed that pelargonidin blocks TPA-induced cell transformation. The possible molecular mechanisms of its potential anti-cancer effects against neoplastic transformation may be attributed to its activation of Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway and its cytoprotective effect.",

The anti-inflammatory activities of PEL were determined by measuring permeability, neutrophils adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in LPS-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mice. We found that PEL inhibited LPS-induced barrier disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and adhesion/transendothelial migration of neutrophils to human endothelial cells. PEL also suppressed LPS-induced hyperpermeability and leukocytes migration in vivo. Furthermore, PEL suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or Interleukin (IL)-6 and the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 by LPS. Moreover, treatment with PEL resulted in reduced LPS-induced lethal endotoxemia.

The potential of PEL treatment to reduce renal damage induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery in mice was measured by assessment of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lipid peroxidation, total glutathione, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, catalase activity, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Treatment with PEL resulted in elevated plasma levels of BUN and creatinine, and of protein in urine in mice with CLP-induced renal damage. Moreover, PEL inhibited nuclear factor-κB activation and reduced the induction of nitric oxide synthase and excessive production of nitric acid.

The treatment options for osteosarcoma are limited and are associated with a number of drawbacks. Therefore there is an urgent need to look for more efficient options for the treatment of this disease. Flavonoids have been considered as important anticancer agents due to their efficacy and lower cytotoxicity. In the present study we evaluated the anticancer effects of pelargonidin in U2OS osteosarcoma cell line. METHODS: Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cell cycle analysis was done by flow cytometry. Expression of proteins was examined by western blotting. RESULTS: Pelargonidin exhibited significant anticancer effects on osteosarcoma U2OS cell line with an IC50 of 15 μM. The anticancer effects of pelargonidin were due to induction of autophagy as evidenced from the expression of LC3-I, LC-3II and Beclin-1. Moreover, pelargonidin triggered ROSinduced reduction in MMP and triggered G2/M cell cycle arrest. In addition, pelargonidin inhibited the expression of p-PI3K and p-AKT in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicated that pelargonidin may prove a potential lead drug for the treatment of osteosarcoma.",

      "abstract": "Fragaria x ananassa Duch., popularly called strawberry, is known for its worldwide consumption and important biological activities, and these effects are related to its high concentration of anthocyanins. Pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside (P3G) is a major anthocyanin found in strawberry, and was evaluated for its anti-inflammatory action in experimental models. The effect of strawberry extract and P3G, on leukocyte migration, exudation levels and many inflammatory mediators, was therefore evaluated in an in vivo model. An in vitro study was also carried out to characterize the effect of P3G on mitogen-activated protein kinases, and on nuclear transcript factors NF-κB and AP-1. The results revealed that the strawberry and P3G have important anti-inflammatory proprieties, and the anti-inflammatory mechanism of P3G involves the arrest of IkB-α activation and reduction in JNKMAPK phosphorylation. The results reinforce that strawberry fruits are functional foods that can act as an adjuvant in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.",

      "abstract": "Pelargonidin is an anthocyanidin isolated from plant resources. It shows strong cytotoxicity toward various cancer cell lines, even though the carcinogenesis-modulating pathway of pelargonidin is not yet known. One of our previous reports showed that pelargonidin arrests the cell cycle and induces apoptosis in HT29 cells. Flowcytometry and immunoblot analysis confirmed that pelargonidin specifically inhibits the activation of CDK1 and blocks the G2-M transition of the cell cycle. In addition, DNA fragmentation was observed along with induction of cytochrome c release-mediated apoptosis. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of pelargonidin's action on cell cycle regulators CDK1, CDK4, and CDK6 as well as the substrate-binding domain of DNMT1 and DNMT3A, which regulate the epigenetic signals related to DNA methylation. The results of docking analysis, binding free energy calculation, and molecular dynamics simulation correlated with the experimental results, and pelargonidin showed a specific interaction with CDK1. In this context, pelargonidin may also inhibit the recognition of DNA and catalytic binding by DNMT1 and DNMT3A. The HOMO-LUMO analysis mapped the functional groups of pelargonidin. Prediction of pharmacological descriptors suggested that pelargonidin can serve as a multitarget inhibitor for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "In the present study, the extraction and isolation of Pelargonidin, an anthocyanin compound from stem bark of Ficus benghalensis are described. The study also involves evaluation of the effect of Pelargonidin on phenotypic variations in zebra fish embryos. Extraction and isolation of Pelargonidin were carried out by employing liquid-liquid extraction technique, phytochemical tests, column chromatography, UV and FT-IR. In the zebra fish embryo model, Paclitaxel was employed as a negative control. A series of phenotypic changes in different stages of embryonic development were studied with treatment concentrations of Pelargonidin between 3.0 and 20 ppm at 0-72-hour post-fertilization (hpf). The results of our studies indicate that, after exposure of zebra fish embryos to 3.3-20 ppm concentration of Pelargonidin for 72 h, a significant reduction in aortic development occurs. At the dose level of 0.5 ppm Paclitaxel and Pelargonidin in the dose range between 3.3 and 20 ppm, the zebra fish embryos were found to have bent tail, malformed eyes and developmental delays in vasculature. Based on the results obtained, we infer that Pelargonidin can exhibit phenotypic anti-angiogenic variations in embryonic stage of fish embryos and it can be applied in future for exploration of its anti-angiogenic potential. Furthermore, Pelargonidin could serve as a candidate drug for in vivo inhibition of angiogenesis and can be applied for the treatment of neovascular diseases and tumor."

TGFBIp is released by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and functions as a mediator of experimental sepsis. Pelargonidin (PEL) is a well-known red pigment found in plants, and has been reported as having important biological activities that are potentially beneficial for human health. This study was undertaken to investigate whether PEL can modulate TGFBIp-mediated inflammatory responses in HUVECs and in mice. The anti-inflammatory activities of PEL were determined by measuring permeability, leukocyte adhesion and migration, and activation of proinflammatory proteins in TGFBIp-activated HUVECs and mice. In addition, the beneficial effects of PEL on survival rate in a mouse sepsis model were tested. We found that PEL inhibited TGFBIp-induced barrier disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules and adhesion/transendothelial migration of neutrophils to human endothelial cells. PEL also suppressed TGFBIp-induced hyperpermeability and leukocyte migration in vivo. These results suggest that PEL possesses anti-inflammatory properties that result in inhibition of hyperpermeability, expression of cell adhesion molecules, and adhesion and migration of leukocytes, thereby endorsing its usefulness as a therapy for vascular inflammatory diseases.",

Furthermore, PEL inhibited the HMGB1-mediated production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), as well as the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2).

This work mainly studied the effect of ultrasound on the stability and antioxidant capacity of pelargonidin-3-glucoside (Pg-3-glu) and the correlation between anthocyanin degradation and •OH generation in a simulated system. Results indicated that the spectral intensities of Pg-3-glu decreased with increasing ultrasound power (200-500 W) and treatment time (0-60 min). The degradation trend was consistent with first-order reaction kinetics (R² > 0.9100). Further study showed that there was a good linear correlation between Pg-3-glu degradation and •OH production (R² = 0.8790), which indicated the important role of •OH in the degradation of anthocyanin during ultrasound exposure. Moreover, a decrease in the antioxidant activity of solution(s) containing Pg-3-glu as evaluated by the DPPH and FRAP methods was observed after ultrasound treatment.",

In this study, we evaluated the possible beneficial effect of chronic pelargonidin (PG) treatment on hyperalgesia in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic neuropathic rat. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 56) were divided into seven groups, i.e. control, diabetic, PG-treated control, PG (single- and multiple-dose)-treated diabetic, and sodium salicylate-treated control and diabetics. For induction of diabetes, STZ was injected i.p. at a single dose of 60 mg/kg. PG was orally administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once and/or on alternate days for 8 weeks; 1 week after diabetes induction. After two months, hyperalgesia was assessed using standard formalin and hot tail immersion tests. Meanwhile, markers of oxidative stress in brain were measured. One-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis of the data. RESULTS: Diabetic rats showed a marked chemical and thermal hyperalgesia, indicating that development of diabetic neuropathy and PG treatment (especially multiple-doses) significantly ameliorated the alteration in hyperalgesia (P less than 0.05-0.01) in diabetic rats as compared to untreated diabetics. PG (multiple doses) also significantly decreased diabetes-induced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances formation and non-significantly reversed elevation of nitrite level and reduction of antioxidant defensive enzyme superoxide dismutase. CONCLUSION: These results clearly suggest that PG prevents diabetic neuropathic hyperalgesia through attenuation of oxidative stress.",

Neuroprotective effect of pelargonidin (Pel) has already been reported, therefore, this study examined whether Pel administration would attenuate behavioural and structural abnormalities and markers of oxidative stress in an experimental model of PD in rat. For this purpose, unilateral intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 12.5mug/5mul of saline-ascorbate)-lesioned rats were pre-treated p.o. with Pel (10 and/or 20mg/kg). Pel administration dose-dependently attenuated the rotational behavior in lesioned rats and protected the neurons of SNC against 6-OHDA toxicity. In addition, pre-treatment with Pel (20mg/kg) significantly decreased the 6-OHDA-induced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation, indicative of a neuroprotection against lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the increase of nitrite levels induced by 6-OHDA, indicate the nitric oxide formation and free radicals production and the decrease of antioxidant defense enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) was non-significantly prevented by Pel (20mg/kg). In summary, Pel administration has a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect against 6-OHDA toxicity, partly through attenuating oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that pelargonidin could provide benefits, along with other therapies, in neurodegenerative disorders including PD.",

Male wistar rats were grouped as normal control, streptozotocin-induced diabetic control, normal treated with pelargonidin and diabetic treated with pelargonidin. Pelargonidin-treated rats received one time i.p injection of the flavonoid (3 mg/kg bodyweight). Biochemical parameters were assayed in blood samples of different groups of rats. Liver was used for histological examinations. Pelargonidin treatment normalized elevated blood glucose levels and improved serum insulin levels in diabetic rats. Glucose tolerance test appeared normal after treatment. Decreased serum levels of SOD and catalase, and increased levels of malondialdehyde and fructosamine in diabetic rats were reverted to their respective normal values after pelargonidin administration. Extents of hemoglobin glycation, hemoglobin-mediated iron release, iron-mediated free radical reactions and carbonyl formation in hemoglobin were pronounced in diabetic rats, indicating association between hemoglobin glycation and oxidative stress in diabetes. Pelargonidin counteracts hemoglobin glycation, iron release from the heme protein and iron-mediated oxidative damages, confirming glycated hemoglobin-associated oxidative stress in diabetes.",
