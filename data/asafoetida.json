      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The musculoskeletal system is the main framework of the human system. Poor osteogenesis is related to poor diet, improper exercise, autoimmune diseases, or age-related conditions. This tends to compromise the quality of human life, especially gait and mobility. Calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D supplements are the prescriptions that address the issues above. Moreover, various natural products in alternative medicines have also been found to have applications in improving bone health. One such finding in our study is the homeopathy potency of Asafoetida, 200CH, which has exhibited a promising osteo-inductive potential in vitro for murine multipotent mesenchymal stem cell line C3H10T1/2. Ferula asafoetida is otherwise a known herb for addressing gastric issues. In this work, the homoeopathy clinician (first author) first repurposed the F. asafoetida potency (dilution) to ameliorate bone disorders such as avascular necrosis and loose body dissolution. Following clinical success, we have proven the osteo-inductive properties of this particular homoeopathy potency of the drug in vitro. Most importantly, the osteo-inductive (osteogenesis) properties of homoeopathy potency 200CH are more pronounced than the native compound combinations in the Mother tincture (Q) of the drug. This homoeopathy drug, hence, can be used for treating osteoarthritis alone or else as an adjuvant with conventional treatment.

      "abstract": "Formaldehyde, a pervasive environmental toxin, has well-documented deleterious effects on critical organ systems. This review examines the therapeutic potential of Ferula asafoetida (FA) root extracts in protecting the testes, kidneys, and liver against formaldehyde-induced toxicity in rodent models. The literature reveals that FA's active constituents, known for their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, may counteract oxidative stress and cellular damage caused by formaldehyde exposure. The review explores formaldehyde-induced pathophysiological mechanisms and FA's protective effects, including mitigation of oxidative damage, inflammation, and apoptosis. By analyzing empirical evidence, it compares the efficacy of various extract preparations, dosage regimens, and treatment durations. The review also addresses methodological heterogeneity and challenges in extrapolating findings to humans. It concludes with a call for rigorous, controlled clinical trials to validate FA's therapeutic viability, offering hope for those affected by formaldehyde toxicity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Contaminated surfaces play a crucial role in transmitting infectious diseases. Effective surface disinfection is essential for interrupting disease transmission by eliminating pathogens on these surfaces. While traditional chemical disinfectants are effective, they pose significant health and environmental concerns, prompting the search for natural alternatives. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of vinegar and asafoetida solution in surface disinfection. METHODS: The swab test was conducted on 10 different surfaces, including rough and smooth surfaces, contaminated with organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. Samples were collected before and after applying the test solution. Additionally, a real-settings swab test was performed on 20 sites with diverse textures within hospital and workplace settings to assess the practical applicability of the test solution in reducing microbial contamination. SETTING: The study was conducted in laboratory settings, followed by real-world application in hospital and workplace environments. INTERVENTION: The test solution, composed of vinegar and asafoetida, was applied to contaminated surfaces to assess its disinfection efficacy. Positive controls included 1% sodium hypochlorite and 5% phenol, while distilled water served as the negative control. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was the reduction in microbial colony counts after the application of the test solution, quantified through swab samples before and after disinfection. RESULTS: Significant reductions in microbial colonies were observed across all tested surfaces following the application of the test solutions, with complete elimination achieved on many surfaces. Percent reductions in microbial colonies ranged from 50% to 100%, and log reductions varied from 0.2 to undefined i.e., complete reduction. CONCLUSION: The test solution effectively reduced microbial loads on smooth and rough surfaces, demonstrating its potential as a natural disinfectant. However, its long-term residual activity and efficacy against viral strains were not evaluated. Therefore, future research should address these gaps to optimize the application of the solution."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infertility and endocrine disorders in women of childbearing age. In Persian medicine, Ferula assafoetida L. (Asafoetida) was recommended for treating PCOS. The present study was conducted to compare the effect of Asafoetida with oral contraceptive tablets on PCOS patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with PCOS (n=30) were enrolled in a double-blind randomized clinical trial. On Day 5 of the menstrual cycle, patients received two periods of 21-day treatment, with 7 days rest between the two treatments. On a daily basis, half of the patients (n=15) received Asafoetida (1 g), and the rest received low dose oral contraceptive (LD; one tablet). Menstrual status, anthropometric characteristics, hematology and biochemistry parameters, ovarian ultrasound examination and hirsutism were evaluated prior to the initiation of the experiment and 14 days after the end of treatment. The occurrence of menstrual cycles and pregnancy was assessed eight months after the end of treatment. RESULTS: The incidence of pregnancy was greater in patients who received Asafoetida compared to those who received LD (p=0.019). The time intervals between menstrual cycles became shorter in both groups (p<0.05). The occurrence of regular menstrual cycles remained longer in the Asafoetida compared to the LD group (p=0.001). Concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL and LDL were significantly increased after treating with LD (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In PCOS patients, the occurrence of regular menstrual cycles and the incidence of pregnancy were improved following treatment with Asafoetida. This medicament could be considered a safe treatment for patients with PCOS."

      "abstract": "Asthma is a significant health-care burden that has great impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. The limited amount of previously reported data and complicated pathophysiology of asthma make it a difficult to treat and significant economic burden on public healthcare systems. Ferula asafoetida is an herbaceous, monoecious, perennial plant of the Umbelliferae family. In Asia, F. asafoetida is used to treat a range of diseases and disorders, including asthma. Several in vitro studies demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of F. asafoetida against asthma. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanism is yet to be discovered. In the framework of current study, network pharmacology approach was used to identify the bioactive compounds of F. asafoetida in order to better understand its molecular mechanism for the treatment of asthma. In present work, we explored a compound-target-pathway network and discovered that assafoetidin, cynaroside, farnesiferol-B, farnesiferol-C, galbanic-acid, and luteolin significantly influenced the development of asthma by targeting MAPK3, AKT1 and TNF genes. Later, docking analysis revealed that active constituents of F. asafoetida bind stably with three target proteins and function as asthma repressor by regulating the expression of MAPK3, AKT1 and TNF genes. Thus, integration of network pharmacology with molecular docking revealed that F. asafoetida prevent asthma by modulating asthma-related signaling pathways. This study lays the basis for establishing the efficacy of multi-component, multi-target compound formulae, as well as investigating new therapeutic targets for asthma."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease and there is currently no effective treatment for AD progression. The use of TCM as a potential treatment strategy for AD is an evolving field of investigation. Asafoetida (ASF), an oleo-gum-resin isolated from Ferula assa-foetida root, has been proven to possess antioxidative potential and neuroprotective effects, which is closely associated with the neurological disorders. However, the efficacy and further mechanisms of ASF in AD experimental models are still unclear. METHODS: A cognitive impairment of mouse model induced by scopolamine was established to determine the neuroprotective effects of ASF in vivo, as shown by behavioral tests, biochemical assays, Nissl staining, TUNEL staining, Immunohistochemistry, western blot and qPCR. Furthermore, the PC12 cells stimulated by H2O2 were applied to explore the underlying mechanisms of ASF-mediated efficacy. Then, the UPLCM analysis and integrated network pharmacology approach was utilized to identified the main constitutes of ASF and the potential target of ASF against AD, respectively. And the main identified targets were validated in vitro by western blot, qPCR and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: In vivo, ASF treatment significantly ameliorated cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine, as evidenced by improving learning and memory abilities, and reducing neuronal injury, cholinergic system impairment, oxidative stress and apoptosis in the hippocampus of mice. In vitro, our results validated that ASF can dose-dependently attenuated H2O2-induced pathological oxidative stress in PC12 cells by inhibiting ROS and MDA production, as well as promoting the activities of SOD, CAT, GSH. We also found that ASF can significantly suppressed the apoptosis rate of PC12 cells increased by H2O2 exposure, which was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. Moreover, treatment with ASF obviously attenuated H2O2-induced increase in caspase-3 and Bax expression levels, as well as decrease in Bcl-2 protein expression. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/Nrf2 /HO-1pathway may be involved in the regulation of cognitive impairment by ASF. The results of western blot, qPCR and immunofluorescence staining of vitro assay proved it. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our work first uncovered the significant neuroprotective effect of ASF in treating AD in vivo. Then, we processed a series of vitro experiments to clarify the biological mechanism action. These data demonstrate that ASF can inhibit oxidative stress induced neuronal apoptosis to foster the prevention of AD both in vivo and in vitro, and it may exert the function of inhibiting AD through PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/Nrf2/HO-1pathway."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Based on data from Chinese and Indian traditional herbal medicines, gum resin of Ferula assa-foetida (sometimes referred to asafetida or asafoetida) has several therapeutic applications. The authors of various studies have claimed that asafetida has cytotoxic, antiulcer, anti-neoplasm, anti-cancer, and anti-oxidative effects. In present study, the anti-aging effect of asafetida on senescent human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated. METHODS: Senescence was induced in in vitro cultured human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) through exposure to H2O2, and the incidence of senescence was recognized by using cytochemical staining for the activity of β-galactosidase. Then, treatment with oleo gum resin of asafetida was started to evaluate its rejuvenating effect. The survival rate of fibroblasts was evaluated by using methyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot assays were performed to evaluate the expressions of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic markers. RESULTS: Our experiments show that asafetida in concentrations ranging from 5 × 10-8 to 10-7 g/mL has revitalizing effects on senescent fibroblasts and significantly reduces the β-galactosidase activity in these cells (P < 0.05). Likewise, treatment at these concentrations increases the proliferation rate of normal fibroblasts (P < 0.05). However, at concentrations higher than 5 × 10-7 g/mL, asafetida is toxic for cells and induces cell death. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that asafetida at low concentrations has a rejuvenating effect on senescent fibroblasts whereas at higher concentrations, it has the opposite effect of facilitating cellular apoptosis and death."

It was at one time employed in the treatment of infantile pneumonia and flatulent colic. The gum resin is antispasmodic, carminative, expectorant, laxative, and sedative. The volatile oil in the gum is eliminated through the lungs, making this an excellent treatment for asthma. The odor of asafoetida is imparted to the breath, secretions, flatus, and gastric eructations. Its properties are antispasmodic, expectorant, stimulant, emmenagogue and vermifuge. Asafoetida has also been used as a sedative. It also thins the blood and lowers blood pressure. It is widely used in India in food and as a medicine in Indian systems of medicine like ayurveda. Asafoetida has been held in great esteem among indigenous medicines, particularly in Unani system from the earliest times."

The degree of the inhibitory effect was dependent on the concentration, form, as well as the time of incubation with asafoetida extracts. The lowest concentrations of Ap and Ao that caused complete (100 %) inhibition of Blastocystis growth and highest (100 %) percentage inhibition of multiplication was 16 and 40 mg/ml, respectively; mean counts at these concentrations either did not differ or decreased significantly when compared to metronidazole control (p < 0.05). Also, the parasites did not resume growth after re-cultivation in asafoetida-free medium when examined further after 48, 72, and 144 h of cultivation. These findings demonstrate the potential of phytomedicine asafoetida as a potent natural alternative for treatment of Blastocystis sp.infection.",

      "abstract": "The present study was conducted to ascertain the modulatory influences of Ferula asafoetida L. (asafoetida, flavoring agent) on the mammary epithelial tissue differentiation, hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes, antioxidant profiles and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mammary carcinogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats. Feeding with two doses of asafoetida (1.25 and 2.5% w/w in diet) showed a remarkable increase in the development and differentiation of ducts/ductules (p < 0.01-0.005), lobules (p < 0.005) and a decrease in terminal end buds (p < 0.05-0.005) as compared to both normal and MNU-treated control animals. To assess the biochemical parameters, effect of asafoetida on drug-metabolizing enzymes was evaluated in the liver of rats. Asafoetida treatment significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the levels of cytochrome P450 and b5. There was an enhancement in the activities of glutathione S-transferase (p < 0.05-0.005), DT-diaphorase (p < 0.05-0.01), superoxide dismutase (p < 0.01-0.005) and catalase (p < 0.05-0.005) and in the level of reduced glutathione (p < 0.05-0.005), followed by asafoetida treatment. Also, asafoetida significantly restored the level of antioxidant system, depleted by MNU-treatment. The strengthening of antioxidant system by the lower and higher doses of asafoetida in the presence and absence of MNU was further substantiated by a significant inhibition (p < 0.005) in lipid peroxidation as measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver of rat. Further, in long-term animal studies, where MNU was used to induce mammary carcinogenesis, asafoetida treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the multiplicity (p < 0.001) and size of palpable mammary tumors (p < 0.005-0.001) and a delay in mean latency period of tumor appearance (p < 0.005). Together, these findings indicate the chemopreventive potential of asafoetida against MNU-induced mammary carcinogenesis. Thus, asafoetida needs further investigation with regard to identification and characterization of its active principle(s) and mechanism of action, for this compound to be developed as a potential chemopreventive agent for human cancers.",
