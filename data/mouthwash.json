      "abstract": "AIMS: Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by fragility and blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. Although there are some studies comparing treatments for oral symptoms, there are few qualitative studies describing the perceived oral impact and the impact on the quality of life (QoL) for those individuals affected. This study explores the self-perceived oral symptoms when using Dentoxol mouthwash to treat oral lesions in a two- and five-times-a-day protocol for individuals living with EB and how this treatment impacts their oral health-related QoL. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted by interviewing patients with EB participating in the protocol: \"Phase II dose-ranging study of Dentoxol mouthwash for managing oral symptoms in EB\". The information collected was analyzed in depth using ATLAS.ti software and grounded theory approach methodology. RESULTS: Nine patients were interviewed until theoretical saturation was reached. Three main categories were identified, and nine subcategories emerged, reporting that oral lesions in people with EB directly affect their QoL. The use of the mouthwash improved several aspects of daily life, such as nutrition and the reduction of the symptoms associated with oral lesions. It is important to consider a delivery method that suits the needs of people pseudosyndactyly. Most patients preferred to use it 2- a day over a 5-times-a-day regime, even though patients with more severe types perceived higher benefits with 5-times-a-day. CONCLUSIONS: People living with EB perceived Dentoxol as a valuable tool in healing their oral lesions, improving their ability to eat and speak, directly impacting their overall QoL.

      "abstract": "The use of mouthwash is a practical approach to decreasing bacteria during orthodontic treatment. This study aimed to investigate the antibacterial effect of 0.2% curcumin mouthwash on Streptococcus mutans in individuals undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. For this double-blinded clinical study, 22 orthodontic patients aged 15 years or older with no systemic or periodontal diseases were selected and randomly divided into 2 groups of 11 individuals. One group received 0.2% curcumin mouthwash (intervention), while the other group received 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash (control) to use twice daily. Orthodontic elastics were collected from the patients' mouth immediately before the first use of the mouthwash, immediately after the first use, and after 20 days of mouthwash use. The elastics were stored in normal saline, and the samples were transferred to a microbiology laboratory for serial dilution, plating, and incubation. After 48 hours, the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) of S mutans were counted and compared. The Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were used for statistical analysis of intragroup data, while the Mann-Whitney U test was used for intergroup comparisons. A difference of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both the curcumin and chlorhexidine groups demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in CFUs of S mutans immediately after the initial use as well as after 20 days' use (P < 0.05). After the first use, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the reduction of CFUs (P = 0.071). However, after 20 consecutive days of mouthwash use, the curcumin group had a significantly greater decrease in CFUs of S mutans than the chlorhexidine group (P < 0.001). Both chlorhexidine and curcumin mouthwashes significantly reduced the number of S mutans colonies when used regularly. The results of the present study suggest that curcumin herbal mouthwash is a superior choice to chlorhexidine for orthodontic patients due to its long-term antibacterial properties.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effectiveness of whitening mouthwashes, both with and without hydrogen peroxide (HP), after at-home teeth whitening in preserving the achieved whiteness and assessing their impact on enamel surface hardness. METHODS: One hundred extracted human premolar teeth were divided into two groups, and home bleaching agents (Philips Zoom NiteWhite 22% Carbamide Peroxide, Ultradent Opalescence PF 16% Carbamide Peroxide) were applied to the groups. The teeth subjected to home bleaching were further divided into five subgroups, and each subgroup underwent a four-week cycle of application of a coloring agent and whitening mouthwash (Colgate Optic White (COW)(%2 HP), Rocs Black Edition (Rocs) (%1 HP), SPLAT Professional Bioactive gargle white Plus (SPLAT) (Ananas sativus fruit extract containing), Listerine Advanced White (Listerine) (Pyrophsphate containing), and distilled water (DW) (control)). Color and microhardness measurements were recorded at baseline, after home bleaching, and after treatment with whitening mouthwashes. RESULTS: Compared with those treated with Opalescence PF, the samples treated with Zoom achieved a significantly greater degree of whitening (p < 0.001). When the effects of postwhitening mouthwash were evaluated (ΔE002), Listerine presented the lowest ΔE002 value in both home bleaching groups, whereas the control group presented the highest ΔE002 value. Both home-bleaching agents caused a significant increase in the initial WID values (p < 0.05). After home-bleaching, the increased WID values (WID2) significantly decreased in all mouthwash groups following exposure to the staining and whitening mouthwash cycle (WID3) (p < 0.05). The impact of home bleaching agents on microhardness was not significantly different (p = 0.151). When we examined the impact of whitening mouthwashes on microhardness, in the Zoom group, no statistically significant difference was observed in surface hardness (p > 0.05). However, in the Opalescence PF group, only the Listerine group showed a statistically significant increase (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Higher concentrations of carbamide peroxide provide faster and more effective whitening. Whitening mouthwash containing HP and pyrophosphate is effective in maintaining tooth whiteness after home bleaching; however, its impact on enamel microhardness depends on the formulation. Notably, only Listerine in the Opalescence PF group significantly increased surface hardness. Given the drawbacks of HP, pyrophosphate-based mouthwash may serve as a safer alternative.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis is considered as one of the most prevalent complications of chemotherapy or radiation therapy in cancerous tumors, which can interrupt the patient's treatment and nutrition. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ginger-honey mouthwash on the prevention of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients suffering from various cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial study, 70 patients receiving chemotherapy were divided into case and control groups. The former group (n = 34) received natural honey-ginger mouthwash and the latter (n = 36) used normal saline for 14 days. The presence and severity of oral mucositis, pain intensity, and other related characteristics were evaluated based on a two-part questionnaire (demographic and clinical information) and a checklist prepared from the protocols of the World Health Organization in each group. RESULTS: During a 14-day intervention, patients received a 7-day intervention with ginger-honey mouthwash revealed a significant reduction in the mean severity of oral mucositis compared to the control group (p = 0.03). However, a 14-day intervention with ginger-honey mouthwash indicated no significant impact on the mean severity of oral mucositis (p = 0.6). In addition, no significant difference was observed in pain intensity between case and control groups during these 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a seven-day intervention with ginger-honey mouthwash has a beneficial effect on reducing the severity of mucositis in patients under chemotherapy, unlike a 14-day intervention. The honey-ginger mouthwash fails to have a significant effect on the pain intensity due to mucositis in patients undergoing chemotherapy."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Plaque-associated gingivitis is widely regarded as a local inflammatory condition initiated by the accumulation of a non-specific dental biofilm in the interaction with the host immune system. The initial symptom noticed by the patient is bleeding gums. The use of mouthwash can serve to supplement mechanotherapy. However, there is an increasing interest in mouthwashes comprising natural ingredients, including cannabidiol (CBD) and spilanthol. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an oral rinse containing spilanthol and CBD oil compared to a rinse containing tea tree oil on the oral microbiota and the values of selected oral status indicators in patients with gingivitis. Methods: The study included 40 patients treated with a rinse containing tea tree oil (TTO)/TTO + spilanthol + CBD for a period of 42 days. Patients rinsed their mouth twice daily for 30 s. The patients' oral microbiome was assessed before and after treatment, and bleeding on probing (BOP) and approximal plaque index (API) were assessed. The study was double-blind. Results: API and BOP were reduced in all groups, both the test and control. The most significant decrease in baseline BOP-1 scores was observed in test groups A and D (p = 0.005062 and p = 0.005062, respectively). A significant difference in API improvement was observed between the initial and final visits in the test (A, D) and control (B, C) groups (p = 0.012516, p = 0.005062, p = 0.004028, p = 0.003172, respectively). Conclusions: Firstly, the use of a mouthwash containing cannabidiol (CBD) and spilanthol was demonstrated to be efficacious in the maintenance of oral microbiota homeostasis. Secondly, the combination of TTO with spilanthol and CBD in the rinse was shown to result in a more significant reduction in selected oral health parameters (BOP and API) and anti-inflammatory effects when compared to a rinse with TTO alone. It should be noted that this is a pilot study and will continue."

      "abstract": "Antiseptic mouthwash use is widespread due to its oral health benefits. However, its impact on systemic physiological processes, particularly nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and muscle contractility, is not fully understood. We sought to determine the effects of cetylpyridinium (antibacterial) versus sodium chloride (control) mouthwashes on salivary and breath NO markers and muscle contractile function in healthy young adults. Thirty participants (n = 15/group) completed a randomized, parallel-arm, blinded trial, comparing the two mouthwashes before and after 7 d of treatment. NO bioavailability was inferred via measurement of salivary nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), and cyclic guanyl monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations and breath NO level. Contractile function of the knee extensor muscles was determined via isokinetic dynamometry. No changes in salivary NO3-, NO2-, or cGMP or in breath NO were observed in response to either treatment. However, cetylpyridinium mouthwash reduced the percentage of NO2- in saliva (17 ± 10% vs. 25 ± 13%; p = 0.0036). Peak torque at velocities of 0-6.28 rad/s was unaffected by mouthwash use. Calculated maximal knee extensor velocity (Vmax) and power (Pmax) were therefore also unchanged. Cetylpyridinium mouthwash reduces the relative abundance of NO2- in the oral cavity but does not significantly diminish overall NO bioavailability or impair muscle contractile function in healthy young adults.",

The aim is to evaluate the effect of vitamin C (VitC) in CHX mouthwash on plaque accumulation and gingivitis, and to compare it with CHX alone mouthwash and antiseptic phenol-containing mouthwashes. This study conducted as a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel design clinical study. Sixty patients were included, randomly divided into three groups. 1. Antiseptic phenol agent (P, Phenol), 2. Antiseptic bisbiguanide agent CHX-only (CHX) and 3. Antiseptic bisbiguanide agent CHX + VitC mouthwash (CHX + VitC). The study assessed oral hygiene and periodontal health status, followed by scaling and root planning (SRP) and subsequent polishing. After using the mouthwash for 60 s twice daily along 14 days, patients recalled for evaluation of plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP) and staining. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the differences formed between groups and Tukey multiple comparison analysis was used to determine groups that showed the differences. Statistical significance was determined using a p-value threshold of 0.05. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding baseline PI, GI and BOP (p > 0.05). Changes at 14th day in PI, GI and BOP in all groups were similar and no significant differences were observed (p > 0.05). Regarding 'all surfaces', staining density of two mouthwashes containing CHX was significantly higher than that of P mouthwash. CHX, CHX + VitC, and P mouthwashes appeared to exhibit comparable effects as oral hygiene adjuncts to periodontal mechanical treatment, with the exception of staining, which was more noticeable in the CHX groups compared to the P group. Adding vitamin C did not enhance the effects of CHx alone.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Tooth sensitivity caused by exposed dentin tubules is a common clinical problem requiring correct treatment methods. Owing to the spread of the COVID-19 virus, it has become common to use different mouthwashes, including 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (HP), before dental procedures. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of 1.5% HP, tooth mousse casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP), and nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HAP) toothpaste on dentinal tubular occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this laboratory interventional study, eighty dentin disks with a thickness of 15 mm were prepared from permanent human molar teeth. Five dentin disks were randomly placed in the untreated group (Group 1). The remaining dentin disks were immersed in 5 mL of 17% Ethylendiaminetetraacetic. Fifteen disks were randomly isolated from the resulting slices, constituting Group 2. The remnants of the disks were submerged in 15 mL of 1.5% HP. Then, they were randomly divided into four groups: not affected by any substance (Group 3), immersed in the artificial saliva (Group 4), tooth mousse CPP-ACP (Group 5), and n-HAP toothpaste (Group 6). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) evaluated the dentinal tubular occlusion in each group, according to the following scoring criteria: Score 1: no occlusion; Score 2: less than 50%; Score 3: more than 50%; Score 4: almost all dentin tubules. Two observers ranked the micrographs separately. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests analyzed the findings (P < 0.05). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the degree of dentin tubule occlusion among the six groups (P < 0.001). The HP group significantly differed with CPP-ACP, n-HAP, and artificial saliva (P < 0.001). Among the interfering experimental materials, the n-HAP demonstrated the highest rate of tubular obstruction (P < 0.05), with the first observer reporting that 66.7% scored 3 and 26.7% scored 4 and the second observer reporting that 73.3% scored 3 and 13.3% scored 4. CONCLUSION: The study's findings suggest that the anti-COVID mouthwash did not amend dentin tubule obstruction, whereas the n-HAP toothpaste showed the best blockage. This implies that in patients with tooth sensitivity who use preprocedural anti-COVID mouthwash, the n-HAP toothpaste could be a beneficial choice to enhance dentinal tubule blockage."

      "abstract": "Early childhood caries (ECC), a severe form of dental caries, is exacerbated by the synergistic interaction between Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans, leading to greater disease severity than their individual effects. This underscores the need for more targeted and potent therapeutic alternatives. Given the promising anti-infective properties of quaternary ammonium surfactants (QAS), this study explores the microbicidal properties of one such QAS, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), against both individual- and dual-species cultures of S. mutans and C. albicans for effective ECC treatment. Initially, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CTAC were determined to range from 4 to 8 µg/mL against S. mutans, C. albicans, and dual-species cultures. Time-kill kinetics, assessed via spot assays and spectrometry, demonstrated that CTAC completely eradicated both individual- and dual-species cultures within 30 min of exposure. Furthermore, at sub-MIC concentrations, CTAC effectively reduced biofilm formation and virulence traits in S. mutans (including acidogenicity and aciduricity) and C. albicans (including yeast-to-hyphal transition and filamentation). To explore therapeutic application, a mouthwash containing CTAC was formulated. The results showed that the formulated CTAC mouthwash was as effective at eradicating pathogens as a commercially available mouthwash containing 0.075% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). Moreover, the CTAC mouthwash maintained stable physicochemical characteristics and antimicrobial activity over 4 weeks. It exhibited rapid killing activity against pathogens, achieving efficacy within just 2 min of exposure. Fluorescence microscopy and SEM micrographs confirmed the strong biofilm eradication potential of the CTAC mouthwash. The non-toxic nature of the formulated mouthwash was validated using human buccal epithelial cells, and in vivo studies further demonstrated that CTAC mouthwash significantly reduced bacterial and fungal loads in Galleria mellonella. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the potential application of QAS-CTAC in the treatment of ECC.",

      "abstract": "STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Denture stomatitis (DS) is a common oral disorder in patients with complete maxillary dentures. Typical treatments such as nystatin or azoles lead to drug resistance after a long period. Several studies have shown the antifungal activity of statins against Candida albicans; however, studies on the antifungal effect of atorvastatin against DS are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this randomized, double-blind controlled trial was to assess the effectiveness of atorvastatin mouthwash against DS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-two participants diagnosed with DS were randomly allocated into 2 groups: 11 in the intervention group (atorvastatin mouthwash) and 11 in the control group (nystatin). Participants were asked to use the mouthwash 3 times a day for 2 weeks. The length and width of the lesions were measured, and the number of colonies were counted on days 1 and 14. Data were analyzed with the Spearman correlation coefficient and the Mann-Whitney, Kruskal Wallis, and Wilcoxon tests (α=.05). RESULTS: The number of colonies before and after using a mouthwash was significantly different in the control and intervention groups (P=.005 and P=.003, respectively). The number of colonies in the 2 groups were statistically similar on the first day (P=.809). However, a significant difference was observed between the groups on day 14 (P=.024). The number of colonies in the atorvastatin group decreased more than nystatin, indicating that atorvastatin was more effective. A significant difference among the groups was found in terms of Candida species detected after the intervention (P=.032). CONCLUSIONS: Atorvastatin was effective in reducing Candida species in participants with DS and can be used as an antifungal agent in treating DS.",

However, its impact on the abundance of oral nitrite-producing species (NPS) and nitrite-producing activity (NPA) remains unexplored. METHODS: Forty-five healthy individuals were randomised into 2 groups to rinse their mouth twice a day for seven days with either CHX-M (n = 21) or PROP-M (n = 24). Metagenomic sequencing (16S rRNA) was performed on saliva samples collected before and after each treatment. Additionally, salivary biomarkers and blood pressure were measured. RESULTS: CHX-M increased the relative abundance of NPS (p < 0.001) but significantly impaired the NPA (p < 0.001) compared to baseline and PROP-M. No significant differences in the relative abundance of NPS and NPA were observed in the PROP-M group. However, a significant increase of plasma nitrate (+7 µmol/L, p = 0.047) and a decrease in systolic BP (-2 mmHg, p = 0.022) was observed in this group compared to the baseline. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that PROP-M had a smaller effect on the abundance of NPS and NPA compared to CHX-M. Additionally, PROP-M reduced blood pressure in healthy individuals, but this effect was not associated with changes in the oral microbiome."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of treating periodontal disease (PD) during pregnancy on adverse birth outcomes, such as preterm birth (PTB) and/or low birth weight (LBW), remains unclear. This is partially due to the fact that Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) have used different combinations of treatment approaches to test this hypothesis. In this meta-analysis of RCTs, we assessed the impact of treating PD during pregnancy with scaling and root planning (SRP) and mouthwash use on PTB and LBW. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was employed across electronic databases, including PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 Tool. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effect models. RESULTS: Out of 133 initially identified reports, 9 RCTs involving 3,985 pregnant women met the inclusion criteria. Periodontal treatment with SRP and mouthwash use in pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of PTB and LBW in meta-analysis with random effects models (pooled RR for PTB = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.22-0.88) and (pooled RR for LBW = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13-0.84). Substantial heterogeneity was observed among studies (I2 = 91% and 90% for PTB and LBW, respectively), with sensitivity analysis suggesting potential sources of heterogeneity. Funnel plot assessment for publication bias showed evidence of asymmetry. CONCLUSION: SRP with mouthwash use during pregnancy were associated with significantly lower risks of PTB and LBW. Larger, well-conducted RCTs are warranted to address this issue, as existing trials are small and exhibit methodological and statistical heterogeneity.",

This study assessed the impact of nanohydroxyapatite (nanoHAP) nanoparticles on Candida albicans biofilm formation on milled polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) denture bases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acquired salivary pellicle was formed on disks milled from a prepolymerized PMMA puck. The disks were assigned to two groups, A (n = 18) and B (n = 18), and each group was further subdivided into three subgroups (6/subgroup), each treated with either Polident solution (antibacterial denture cleanser), nanoHAP mouthwash, or distilled water. Disks in group A subgroups were soaked in their respective treatment solutions for 8 h, followed by biofilm formation on the disk for 24 h. Disks in group B subgroups had C. albicans biofilm formed on them for 24 h, followed by soaking in their respective treatment solutions for 8 h. Biofilm thickness, biomass, and live/dead cell ratio were determined using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Biofilm morphology was examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons (α = 0.05). RESULTS: In group A, nanoHAP mouthwash displayed significant anti-adhesive properties. In group B, biofilm biomass and thickness significantly decreased (p < 0.05), with the nanoHAP showing the most substantial reduction in existing biofilm compared to other solutions, but it did not significantly affect cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the efficacy of nanoHAP mouthwash in inhibiting C. albicans biofilm formation when used as a storage medium for acrylic dentures. It suggests its potential clinical application for preventing denture stomatitis in patients."

      "abstract": "Oral ulcers are a prevalent oral mucosal disorder, characterized by benignancy and self-limiting progression. However, a subset of these ulcers exhibits resistance to conventional therapeutic interventions, necessitating alternative treatment strategies. In this study, we present two cases of refractory oral ulcers that demonstrated limited responsiveness to standard treatments but achieved significant therapeutic benefits following the application of a compound Chinese herbal mouthwash. Case 1 involved a 60-year-old female patient diagnosed with Behçet's syndrome. Initial treatment with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants yielded limited improvement in her oral ulcers; however, combination therapy involving the Chinese herbal mouthwash resulted in significant improvement and complete healing after a 2-week period. Case 2 presented a 48-year-old female patient with chronic tongue ulceration pain persisting for one year without any detectable systemic etiology. Despite receiving oral vitamin supplementation and local analgesic jelly, her symptoms remained unalleviated. A 3-week treatment regimen involving the administration of the Chinese herbal mouthwash in conjunction with thalidomide led to the complete resolution of her oral ulcers. The findings from this study suggest that the compound Chinese herbal mouthwash may serve as an adjuvant therapeutic approach for managing chronic oral ulcers that are resistant to conventional treatment.",

This study aims to determine the efficacy of a new chlorhexidine compound compared with the gold standard 0.12% chlorhexidine during periodontal maintenance of a patient with periodontitis grade I or II after scaling and root planing treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A parallel, randomized, double-blind clinical trial with two arms: (A) treatment with 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash; (B) treatment with new chlorhexidine mouthwash containing O-Cymen-5-Ol. The patient was examined: (D0) initial examination, (D7) clinical examination one week after treatment, (D14) clinical examination two weeks after treatment and (D28) clinical examination three weeks after treatment. They are collecting the following data: Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding index (BoP), pocket depth (PS), and attachment loss (CAL). RESULTS: After a follow-up of 43 patients, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups at any of the times or for any of the parameters evaluated, meeting the predefined criteria of non-inferiority.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children are more prone to develop gingivitis as a result of deficient oral hygiene, morphological variance, and a diet that encourages the growth of pathogenic oral bacteria. AIM: The purpose of this randomized, double-blind clinical study is to compare the therapeutic effect of an herbal mouthwash made of decoction and ethanolic extract of Populus euphratica and Myrtus communis to that of chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthrinse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 60 patients aged between 8 and 10 years were divided into four groups, each with 15 patients. The first group was treated with a mouthwash made of ethanolic herbal extract, the second group was treated with a mouthwash made of herbal decoction, the third group was treated with CHX mouthwash (0.12%) (positive control), and the fourth group was treated with a placebo made with colored distilled water (negative control). Clinical parameters gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were evaluated at the start, 1, and 2 weeks from ensuing the treatment. Preoperative and postoperative photographs of the maxillary anterior sextant were recorded to evaluate CIELab coordinates to monitor color changes. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc tests were used for data assessment. RESULTS: Significant reductions in GI and PI were found among the tested groups (p < 0.05). A significant reduction in a* value was observed, while L* value showed a significant increase between baseline and posttreatment (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Herbal-based mouthwash of Populus euphratica and Myrtus communis, whether prepared by boiling or ethanolic extraction, reduced gingival inflammation significantly and has a lot of potential for treating and preventing periodontal disease in young children. Digital photography is a reliable supplementary approach for diagnosing and monitoring gingival inflammation in pediatric patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  This study was a randomized, double-blind clinical trial study. The study included 57 participants with periodontitis. Clinical parameters (plaque index [PI], bleeding on probing [BOP], probing pocket depth [PPD], and clinical attachment loss [CAL]) were examined at the baseline visit, after 7 days, and after 30 days of using resveratrol mouthwash as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal treatment. The salivary levels of (interleukin [IL]-6) and RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand) were measured and compared before and after treatment. The participants answered the visual analog scale-based assessment questionnaire at the last visit. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  A one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) test was used to compare the means of multiple groups (test, positive control, negative control) at baseline and after treatment. A paired t-test was also used to compare the means of a single group before and after treatment. In addition, Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used to identify specific pairwise differences between the three groups after finding significant differences with ANOVA. The Chi-square test was also used to compare the distribution of categorical variables like sex between the groups. RESULTS:  All interventions significantly reduced PI, BOP, PPD, and CAL, but resveratrol and chlorhexidine had a higher significant effect than placebo except for CAL without a significant difference between them. All mouthwashes significantly reduced the salivary concentration of IL-6. However, resveratrol and chlorhexidine had a significantly higher effect than placebo, while the concentration of RANKL was decreased in all groups without a significant difference between them. The participants' responses to the mouthwash questionnaire showed that resveratrol and chlorhexidine had the same feedback without significant differences. CONCLUSION:  Resveratrol-containing mouthwash could be used as an alternative to chlorhexidine as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal treatment of periodontitis."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Methotrexate (MTX) is a common medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). MTX inhibits rapid cell turnover throughout the body which can lead to significant side effects. Patients who present with oral lesions may have suffered severe acute toxicity from MTX. Supportive pain treatment includes magic mouthwash solution and/or oral viscous lidocaine to manage pain and allow for healing. We report a case of MTX induced oral mucositis that did not respond to magic mouthwash but did improve with a morphine mouthwash solution. Case: A 67-year-old female with RA presented with worsening oral lesions over 2 weeks. She reported non-compliance with folic acid for 2 weeks while on MTX. Physical exam revealed ulcerating oral lesions on the mucous membranes consistent with mucositis. Pain treatment was initiated with magic mouthwash, but her pain was not well controlled after 24 hours, and still unable to swallow. An oral morphine mouthwash solution was initiated, and patient reported improved pain control over the next 48 hours. She was on the morphine mouthwash for 6 days during which improvement in the lesions was noted. Discussion: Pain management is imperative for oral mucositis. When traditional therapies do not provide adequate control, morphine mouthwash can be considered. It is a safer alternative to systemic opioids and topical opioids may influence cell proliferation and migration, which can positively impact healing of oral lesions. Conclusion: A morphine mouthwash solution can provide effective pain management for oral mucositis lesions in patients who do not respond adequately to magic mouthwash.",

      "abstract": "This multi-arm, parallel group, single-blinded randomised controlled trial aimed to assess three commercially available mouthwashes effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This manuscript has been written in accordance with the CONSORT statement. Methods. Eligible participants were SARS-CoV-2 positive with a positive test in the last 72 h. All participants had mild to moderate symptoms and could provide five saliva samples over a 60 min period. Participants delivered a baseline saliva sample and then used a mouthwash as per manufacturer's instructions. They provided further saliva samples at minute 1, 10, 30 and 60. Participants were randomised to one of four groups; OraWize+, Total Care Listerine, Cool Mint Listerine and water (control). The lab-based research team were blind to the intervention. The research question was: can SARS-CoV-2 be rendered inactive in saliva by using a mouthwash and how long does this effect last? The primary outcome was the amount of viable infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus in the sample, compared to the baseline sample. The secondary outcome measure was the amount of genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the sample, measured via PCR testing. Results. In total 100 participants were recruited (25 per group). Eight participants did not receive the allocated intervention and did not have saliva samples collected. There were no adverse events. In total 42 of the 92 participants had viable virus which could be cultured at baseline. Statistical analysis of the primary outcome was not advised due to the reduced level of viable virus at baseline and the positive skewness present in the distribution of log10(titre) data. Observational data of the primary outcome measure is presented. Analysis of the secondary outcome PCR measure showed that there was strong evidence for a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels compared to water for all mouthwashes after 1 min, OraWize+ -0.49 (-0.92, -0.05), p-value 0.029, Cool Mint Listerine -0.81 (-1.25, -0.38), p-value<0.001, Total Care Listerine -1.05 (-1.48, -0.62), p-value<0.001. For the remaining timepoints there was generally no evidence of virus level reduction compared to water although there is weak evidence for a decrease at ten minutes using Total Care Listerine -0.44 (-0.88, 0.01), p-value 0.053. Conclusion. The three mouthwashes included in this trial observationally demonstrated a reduction in virus titre level 1 min after use, with virus levels normalising up to 60 min compared to the control. Although an interesting observation, this result could not be statistically analysed. Using the secondary outcome PCR measure all three included mouthwashes reduced virus levels compared to water at 1 min and these results were statistically significant. Clinically this result does not support the use of the included mouthwashes to reduce SARS-CoV-2 levels in saliva."

This study assessed the efficacy of a mouthwash with Chlorhexidine, Benzydamine, Nanosilver, Amoxicillin, and Metronidazole for pain reduction and enhancement of maximum mouth opening in acute pericoronitis cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at the Gorgan Dental Faculty, 48 pericoronitis patients were randomized into two groups. The control group used a 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash, while the case group used a mouthwash containing Chlorhexidine, Benzydamine, Nanosilver, Amoxicillin, and Metronidazole. The study recorded Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for 7 days, and Maximum mouth opening (MMO) was measured at the start and after 7 days. The analysis was performed using SPSS v20. RESULTS: In this study, we compared the effects of a combined mouthwash with those of a chlorhexidine mouthwash on pericoronitis in 48 patients, with an average age of 21.56 years. No significant difference in pain reduction was observed between the groups; however, both groups exhibited decreased pain and improved MMO post-treatment. The gender distribution was balanced across both groups. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that both chlorhexidine mouthwash and combined mouthwash significantly improved maximum mouth opening. Nonetheless, there were no notable differences in efficacy between the two groups. These findings suggest that these mouthwashes may be beneficial for oral hygiene, warranting further in-depth research.

Therefore, this study aims to assess the effect of Achyranthes aspera and Trachyspermum ammi (AA + TA) based herbal mouthwash, 0.2 % CHX, and placebo mouthwash on gingival health, plaque control and antibacterial activity against specific periodontal pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia) using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). METHODS: This was a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial involving 108 children with plaque-induced gingivitis who were randomly assigned to three groups of 36 children each: Group A, AA + TA mouthwash; Group B, CHX mouthwash; and Group C, placebo mouthwash. Gingival index and plaque index were recorded at baseline, 7th and 21st day. RT-PCR was employed to determine the bacterial counts of each plaque sample at baseline and after 21 days. RESULTS: All three groups exhibited a gradual and significant reduction in both gingival and plaque scores from baseline to days 7 and 21. However, the placebo group did not demonstrate a significant difference in scores between days 7 and 21. Furthermore, a significant reduction in bacterial counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia was observed in the groups receiving CHX and AA + TA mouthwash after 21 days of intervention compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: AA + TA mouthwash demonstrated non-inferiority in anti-gingivitis and anti-plaque properties compared to CHX, suggesting its potential suitability as an alternative to CHX when used in conjunction with mechanical plaque control measures."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: AgNPs stabilized with chitosan were synthesized by chemical reduction of AgNO3. The nanoparticles were characterized with SEM, FTIR, DLS and ICP-OES. The MIC and MBC against S. mutans and IC50 concentration of CCAgNPF were obtained for antibacterial and cytotoxicity evaluations, respectively. For the clinical study, a total of 45 orthodontic patients were divided into three groups of 15 and used the following mouthwashes twice a day for 1 month: CCAgNPF, chlorhexidine 0.2% and the combination of these mouthwashes. The colony count of salivary S. mutans was evaluated before and after using the mouthwashes. The data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. RESULTS: Stabilized AgNPs were spherical with a diameter of 25.3 ± 3.3 nm. The MIC, MBC and IC50 of CCAgNPF were 4.42, 8.85 and 18.89 µg/ml. All mouthwashes reduced the salivary S. mutans of the orthodontic patients, however, no significant difference was found between the efficacy of CCAgNPF and chlorhexidine (P-value > 0.05). The best results were achieved by the combination of CCAgNPF and chlorhexidine mouthwashes (P-value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The CCAgNPF and its combination with chlorhexidine present potent bactericidal, biocompatible and effective anti-carious mouthwashes for orthodontic patients. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study proved CCAgNPF as an antibacterial mouthwash with lower cytotoxicity and side effects for patients undergoing orthodontic treatments to maintain oral hygiene and reduce salivary S. mutans.",

The American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of mouthwash containing 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) or 0.2% povidone iodine (PI) to reduce the viral load in the upper respiratory tract and decrease the risk of transmission. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H 2O 2, or 1.5% H 2O 2 and water on the cycle threshold (CT) value obtained by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHODS: This study is a randomized single blind controlled clinical trial which has been registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry on the 3 rd February 2022 (Registration number: ISRCTN18356379). In total, 69 subjects recruited from Persahabatan General Hospital who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups or the control group. The subjects were instructed to gargle with 15 mL of mouthwash for 30 s in the oral cavity followed by 30 s in the back of the throat, three times per day for 5 days. CT values were collected on postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. RESULTS: The results of the Friedman test significantly differed among the groups (n=15). The CT values increased from baseline (day 0) to postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. CONCLUSIONS: Mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H 2O 2, or 1.5% H 2O 2 and water increased the CT value.",

However, CHX is also considered as a possible factor in the emergence of cross-resistance to antibiotics. The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in the oral microbiota and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) due to CHX treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the oral metagenome of 20 patients who applied a 0.2% CHX mouthwash twice daily for 4 weeks following periodontal surgical procedures. Saliva and supragingival plaque samples were examined before, directly after 4 weeks, and another 4 weeks after discontinuing the CHX treatment. RESULTS: Alpha-diversity decreased significantly with CHX use. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity increased in both sample sites and mainly streptococci showed a higher relative abundance after CHX treatment. Although no significant changes of ARGs could be detected, an increase in prevalence was found for genes that encode for tetracycline efflux pumps. CONCLUSION: CHX treatment appears to promote a caries-associated bacterial community and the emergence of tetracycline resistance genes. Future research should focus on CHX-related changes in the microbial community and whether the discovered tetracycline resistance genes promote resistance to CHX."

The aim was to provide preliminary clinical data on a new line of oral hygiene products containing a prebiotic and a paraprobiotic based on Lactobacillus plantarum. The recruitment rate and patient satisfaction were analyzed to estimate resources for the future primary study, and descriptive data on rebalancing of the oral microbiota were collected. The population was divided into 5 groups based on the products assigned to the patients: 1, delicate mint toothpaste (n = 20); 2, mint toothpaste (n = 12); 3, mint mouthwash (n = 20); 4, delicate mint toothpaste, mint mouthwash, and an antimicrobial toothbrush (n = 20); and 5, continued use of their usual oral care products and routine (control group; n = 12). The study duration was 28 days. All patients tolerated the products well, and there were no adverse events. The recruitment capability and procedures allowed for a realistic estimation for the future main trial. The products did not cause any changes in tooth color. The participants in group 4, who completed the treatment consisting of delicate mint toothpaste, mint mouthwash, and an antimicrobial toothbrush, reported the greatest reduction in gingival sensitivity (P ≤ 0.000; Wilcoxon signed rank test). Analysis with the Wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that all products induced a statistically significant decrease in plaque (P ≤ 0.002) and a reduction in gingival sensitivity (delicate mint toothpaste, P ≤ 0.005; mint toothpaste, P ≤ 0.015; and mint mouthwash, P ≤ 0.015). All products were effective in stabilizing the oral microbiota. The tested products showed an optimal safety profile and a statistically significant efficacy in reducing gingival sensitivity and plaque. They also stabilized the biodiversity of the oral microbiota, making it less susceptible to microbial fluctuations than the control group. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05999175).",

Licorice, a natural herb, could be a potential alternative to chlorhexidine. However, the effect of licorice mouthwash on the oral health of intubated patients has not been studied yet. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of licorice and chlorhexidine mouthwash on the oral health of intubated patients. METHODS: This was a triple-blind clinical trial. The sample included 130 intubated patients admitted to an intensive care unit in Iran. The samples were selected by convenience sampling and randomly assigned to two groups: A and B. In group A, the main researcher applied 15 ml of 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash after each brushing (twice a day for 5.5 days) and suctioned it after 30 s. In group B, 20% licorice mouthwash was used instead of chlorhexidine. The demographic information questionnaire and the Beck Oral Assessment Scale (BOAS) were completed by one of the nurses before and on the sixth day of the study. RESULTS: Finally, 60 patients in each group completed the study. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of demographic variables or oral health before the intervention (P > 0.05). The oral health of patients in both the chlorhexidine and liquorice mouthwash groups improved significantly after the intervention (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in oral health between the two groups at postintervention (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that both mouthwashes exerted a comparable effect on dental and oral health. However, the chlorhexidine mouthwash showed a greater impact on the reduction of dental plaque and the thinning of saliva compared to licorice mouthwash. In essential cases, licorice mouthwash can be employed as an alternative to chlorhexidine.",

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is essential in acute allergy reactions and chronic allergic inflammatory disorders. PURPOSE: This report aims to describe the advantages of total IgE screening for detecting mouthwash allergic reactions associated with ROEM. CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old woman came to the Oral Medicine clinic complaining of canker sores all over her mouth and swollen lips accompanied by crusts that had been bleeding easily two months prior. Complaints worsened after the patient used alcohol-containing mouthwash without a history of fever or other symptoms. Extra-oral examination showed upper and lower lip edema with hemorrhagic crusts that bleed easily. No lesions were found in other parts of the body. Intra-oral examination showed ulcers, multiple, irregular in almost the entire oral mucosa. Laboratory examination revealed non-reactive anti-HSV-1 IgG and a total IgE serum level of 612.00 IU/mL. The diagnosis based on the examination results is recurrent oral erythema multiforme. CASE MANAGEMENT: The patient was instructed to stop using alcohol-containing mouthwash, maintain oral hygiene, a healthy lifestyle, adequate hydration, and a balanced diet. Prednisone, benzydamine HCL mouthwash, 0.025% hyaluronic acid mouthwash, multivitamins, and hydrocortisone cream were given as pharmacological therapy. The oral lesions improved in 12 days and the total IgE serum level examination showed a decrease (385 IU/mL). CONCLUSION: The total IgE examination can be a screening tool for mouthwash allergy-related reactions to disease and represents the response of ROEM therapy as evidenced by clinical improvement."

Although various mouthwashes have shown reduction of plaque and gingivitis the search is still on for an ideal mouthwash with minimum side effects and better patient acceptance. OBJECTIVES: To access the efficacy of all the mouthwashes in the management of gingivitis. METHODS: By purposive sampling, 81 patients of both sexes with gingivitis were randomized by lottery method into 3 groups - A, B and C. Group A received scaling and Triphala mouthwash, Group B received scaling and Curcumin mouthwash and Group C underwent scaling and received Chlorhexidine mouthwash. Oral hygiene was assessed using Plaque, Gingival and Bleeding indices at baseline,7th day and 14th day. The inter-group comparisons were analysed using One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparisons using Tukey's Honest significant difference test (α = 0.05) and the intra-group comparisons for the indices across various time periods within each group were analysed using Repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons post hoc test (α = 0.05). The statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: The study has shown that herbal mouthwashes are as effective as chlorhexidine in treating gingivitis although curcumin mouthwash showed a greater potential in reducing gingival inflammation. CONCLUSION: Both Triphala and Curcumin mouthwashes were proven to be equally effective in reducing plaque, gingival and bleeding scores, although curcumin was better in reducing gingival inflammation. Hence herbal mouthwashes such as Triphala and Curcumin with no side effects can be considered as an alternative mouthwash to chlorhexidine."

The incidence of VAP in the intervention group compared to the control group was 10.9% vs. 30.9% on the third day (P = 0.0166, 95% CI: 0.53-0.83 and RR = 0.35), 23.6% vs. 43.6% on the fifth day (P = 0.0325 and 95% CI: 0.31-0.95 and RR = 0.54), and 25.5% vs. 47.3% on the seventh day (P = 0.0224, 95% CI: 0.32-0.92, and RR = 0.54). The Mann-Whitney indicated the incidence of VAP was significantly lower in the intervention group on the third, fifth, and seventh days. CONCLUSION: Propolis mouthwash can be considered as an alternative to chlorhexidine mouthwash for ICU patients. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Propolis mouthwash serves as a simple, economical intervention to potentially reduce incidence of VAP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: (IRCT20110427006318N12, date 02.04.2019).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Natural enzymes mouthwash has been proposed as salivary substitutes to treat xerostomia. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the mouthwash to treat xerostomia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double-blind, parallel group randomised control clinical trial involving N = 49 adult participants with xerostomia was carried out. Intervention group received natural enzymes moisturising mouthwash (with active ingredients lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase); while control group received benzydamine mouthwash. Mouthwashes were repacked, labelled with specific code, and were given to participants by third-party. Subjects were instructed to rinse with the mouthwash 4 times per day at a specific period, for 2 weeks. Symptoms of xerostomia were assessed using Xerostomia Inventory at day 0 and 14; together with the assessment of Clinical Oral Dryness Score (CODS), and measurement of resting and stimulated salivary flow rate. RESULTS: 48 participants completed the clinical follow-up, and n = 1 had lost of follow-up. From the 48 participants, n = 23 received natural enzymes mouthwash, while n = 25 received benzydamine mouthwash. Intervention group achieved reduction in symptoms of xerostomia from baseline. Intervention group also showed significantly better improvements in the cognitive perception of dry mouth and oromotor function such as chewing, swallowing and speech of the participants; and reduction in waking up at night to drink water (p < 0.05). The CODS and resting salivary flow rate were also significantly improved in intervention group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Use of natural enzymes mouthwash improved signs and symptoms of xerostomia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Natural enzymes mouthwash is potentially effective to treat xerostomia, well-tolerated and safe to be used by xerostomia patients.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The decline in dental caries has been attributed to the widespread use of fluoride (F). Two forms of presentation are fluoridated toothpaste (FT) and mouthwash (MW), widely used by the population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate in vitro the effects of combining FT and MW, whether supplemented with sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) or not, on dental enamel demineralization. Bovine enamel blocks (n = 60) were selected based on initial surface hardness (SHi) and divided into 5 experimental groups (n = 12 each): I) Placebo Toothpaste (without F/TMP); II) 1100 ppm F Toothpaste (FT); III) 1100F associated with a MW at 100 ppm F (FT + MW 100F); IV) 1100F associated with a MW at 225 ppm F (FT + MW 250F); and V) 1100F associated with a MW at 100 ppm F supplemented with 0.4 % TMP (FT + MW 100F-TMP). The blocks were treated twice a day, undergoing 5 pH cycles over 7 days. Thus, the percentage change in surface hardness (%SH), integrated subsurface hardness loss (ΔKHN), and the concentration of F, phosphorus (P), and calcium (Ca) in the enamel were determined. The data were submitted to ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test (p < 0.001). RESULTS: The 1100F group was statistically inferior to the groups associated with MW for %SH, ΔKHN, and the concentration of P and Ca in the enamel (p < 0.001). Blocks treated with FT + MW 225F and FT + MW 100F-TMP showed significantly lower %SH compared to the other groups (p < 0.001). The FT + MW 100F - TMP group exhibited the lowest depth mineral loss (ΔKHN), and higher concentration de P in enamel (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The adjunct use of MW with FT produces a greater protective effect in inhibiting enamel demineralization, and the supplementation of TMP to the MW with 100F provides a superior effect compared to MW with 225F. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This combination of treatments could be regarded as one of several alternative fluoride supplements for subjects at elevated risk of caries.",

The objective of this investigation was to conduct a comparative analysis of the clinical effectiveness of various oral rinses in mitigating the symptoms of chronic gingivitis. METHODS: This empirical study was conducted within the confines of the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology. A cohort of 60 individuals diagnosed with chronic gingivitis, ranging from 18 to 45 years of age and inclusive of all sexes, was systematically selected for participation. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis yielded data indicating that the mean score on the gingival index was minimally recorded for participants utilizing herbal mouthwash (HO), in contrast to those administered with normal saline (NS), which displayed the highest mean score. A corresponding trend was observed with the plaque index, where the HO users exhibited the lowest mean values, as opposed to the NS cohort, which demonstrated the highest. CONCLUSION: Employing post-hoc statistical evaluations, a pronounced disparity in the mean gingival index was discerned favoring the chlorhexidine (CHX) and HO groups over the NS group. No statistical significance was detected in the comparative mean gingival index between the CHX and HO cohorts. This pattern of findings was paralleled in the plaque index assessments, where the NS group's values were significantly elevated relative to those of both the CHX and HO groups."

This study assessed the activity and feasibility of benzydamine mouthwash in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced OM in patients with HNC during radiation therapy (RT). METHODS: This phase IV, international, open-label, single-group study conducted from December 2021 to September 2022. In total, 89 patients were enrolled across seven centers in Hungary and Poland. Patients used benzydamine mouthwash at home two to three times daily. Data were collected during clinical visits at baseline (V0, start of RT) and then weekly for seven visits (V1-V7). The safety population and the modified intention-to-treat (m-ITT) analysis sets contained 89 patients; the per protocol (PP) analysis set contained 67 patients. RESULTS: The m-ITT set was 80.9% male; mean age was 61.4 years. At baseline, 73.0% of patients had stage T3-T4, 23.6% had stage T1-T2, 61.8% had stage N2-N3, and 34.9% had stage N0-N1. Within the m-ITT population, 33.7% (n=30) responded to treatment (NRS < 5) during the study. The PP set responded similarly (29.9%). Most patients were treatment compliant (n=77; 86.5%). OM severity was assessed using the WHO OM grading scale. No patients had severe mucositis at baseline or V1. At V7, 34.1% had mild mucositis, 45.1% had moderate mucositis, 15.9% had severe mucositis, and 1.2% had life-threatening mucositis. In total, 26 patients (29.2%) developed severe mucositis during the study period (V2-V7). From V1 to V4, one patient reported hospitalization due to mucositis or associated complications, two patients at V5, three patients at V6, and four patients at 7. DISCUSSION: This was the first study to assess feasibility of a treatment for radiation-induced OM with benzydamine mouthwash in patients with HNC. Treatment compliance suggested that benzydamine was well tolerated in patients with moderate to severe mucositis. Benzydamine's anesthetic and anti-inflammatory properties might have reduced pain, which potentially influenced patients' compliance with RT. Few patients in the study required hospitalization for OM or an associated complication, suggesting that benzydamine might improve healthcare resource utilization."

BACKGROUND: Tooth color change frequently occurs during orthodontic treatment and represents a self-perceived need. According to the patient's perspective, there is a preference for the use of toothpaste and mouthwashes with some whitening effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic bibliographic search in English was carried out until June 2022, in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Randomized or nonrandomized clinical trials and experimental laboratory studies were included. REVIEW RESULTS: A total of 57 papers were obtained from an electronic search and 11 studies were included in the review. Outcomes such as strength force elastomeric, color stability, frictional resistance, ion release, shear bond strength (SBS), and adhesive remnant index (ARI) were evaluated. CONCLUSION: Toothpaste and mouthwashes with whitening action did not have a favorable effect on most of the outcomes evaluated. In some cases regular toothpaste showed a better effect and in other cases, there were no differences with the control group. Only in the outcome release of ions from wires to whitening effect in teeth with or without attached brackets, they have a better performance. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Due to the unfavorable effects of over-the-counter whitening toothpaste and mouthwashes on orthodontic materials and appliances, their use should be justified during treatment.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: One of the main reasons that patients seek orthodontic treatment is aesthetics. Unfortunately, treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances can at times increase the chances of developing white spot lesions on the surfaces of teeth, thus creating a new aesthetic issue for the patient. The prevalence of white spot lesions (WSL) reported after treatment varies from 2% to 97%, and these lesions can occur despite increased attention to hygiene. Hence the aim of this study was to assess the effect of Amine fluoride mouthwash in preventing white spot lesions during fixed orthodontic therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study participants were randomly divided into two groups (Group A - experimental 25 patients and Group B - control 25 patients). The pre-intervention and post-intervention intra-oral digital photographs were analysed by using ImageJ software to assess the percentage of the facial surface affected on the teeth (10 maxillary teeth), which had white spot lesions. RESULTS: The mean value of WSLs showed significant difference between the experimental and control groups. Mean values of WSL in the experimental group decreased from 2 to 1.54 with a mean difference of 0.46 after 6 months of follow-up which indicated that amine fluoride mouthwash was effective in preventing WSLs during fixed orthodontic treatment. CONCLUSION: WSLs scores were significantly reduced in patients who received the mouthwash when compared to patients who followed standard oral hygiene regimen with fluoridated toothpaste only. In clinical practice, amine fluoride mouthwash is an effective method for the prevention of WSLs during fixed orthodontic treatment.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Propolis mouthwash compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash as an adjunct to mechanical therapy in improving clinical parameters in perimenopausal women with chronic periodontitis. METHODOLOGY: A double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted by recruiting 144 subjects with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis. After scaling and root planning, subjects were allocated to two treatment groups: 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash and 20% propolis mouthwash twice daily for six weeks. Clinical parameters such as pocket probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment loss (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were analysed at baseline, six weeks, and 12 weeks. RESULT: The mean value of PPD in the propolis group was 4.67 at baseline, reduced to 4.01 at six weeks and 3.59 at 12 weeks. While in the chlorhexidine group, the baseline value of 4.65 reduced to 4.44 and 4.25 at six weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. The baseline value of the mean CAL in the propolis group was 4.45. This value was reduced to 4.15 at six weeks and 3.77 at 12 weeks. For the chlorhexidine group, the baseline value of CAL was 4.80, which was reduced to 4.50 and 4.19 at six weeks and 12 weeks. The mean value of bleeding on probing in the propolis group was 77.20, which decreased to 46.30 at six weeks and 14.60 at the final visit. In the chlorhexidine group, the mean value of 77.30 was reduced to 49.60 and 22.80 at subsequent visits. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that both propolis and chlorhexidine mouthwash positively improve clinical parameters; however, propolis is significantly more effective in improving BOP.

      "abstract": "The biofilm formation around dental implant abutment is considered the main cause of peri-implant infection. The use of antimicrobial mouthwash might potentially reduce biofilm formation and subsequent infection. This study aimed to evaluate the antibiofilm properties of mastic gum resin extract (MGRE) against S. Mutans biofilm on the surface of titanium dental implant discs. This study used grade five (medical grade) titanium dental implant discs measuring 15 mm in diameter. The substances in the MGRE were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) which found 12 detectable chemicals in MGRE. In this study, S. mutans was collected around the healing abutment of a recently placed dental implant and then cultured on titanium discs (in vitro). After bacterial growth on the titanium specimens for 24 hours, they were subjected to either chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), (n = 6) or MGRE (n = 6). The antibacterial activity tests showed that both CHX and MGRE significantly inhibited bacterial growth compared to the negative control, the lactate production and turbidity measurements were significantly lower in MGRE and CHX compared to the control (p ≤ 0.05). Regarding the antibiofilm activity, both treatments showed significantly less turbidity in their biofilm compared to the control. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that there were very limited adherence cells on the titanium implant discs in treatment groups, while there were confluent and attached bacterial cells in the control. The MGRE showed an antimicrobial property against S. mutans indicating that it has a potential for clinical use as a mouthwash.",

The development of Acyclovir (ACV) resistant strains due to long-term treatment with antiviral agents in those patients is not uncommon. The aim of the present study was to assess the virucidal effect of commercially available mouthwashes against ACV-resistant HSV-1 strains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strains were exposed for 30 s to essential oil-based (Listerine Fresh Burst® and Listerine Zero®), chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% (Hexidyl®) and povidone-iodine 7.5% (Betadine Gargle®) mouthwashes. Loss of virus infectivity was determined by means of plaque reduction assays in a cell culture system. RESULTS: All 4 of the tested solutions significantly reduced virus infectivity, with the essential oil-based and povidone-iodine mouthwashes being slightly more efficacious, compared to chlorhexidine. CONCLUSION: The findings of this analysis revealed that the tested oral rinses demonstrated in-vitro antiviral activity against ACV-resistant HSV. Comparative clinical trials are required to establish the clinical effectiveness of daily use of oral rinses in reducing the appearance of oral HSV lesions in immunocompromised patients.",

      "abstract": "Aim Oxygen-enriched mouthwash products are based on oral topical oxygen therapy (OOT), which supports the formation of new blood vessels and the removal of toxins and waste products from the affected area and stimulates the synthesis of collagen. These antioxidant mouthwashes contain honey, lactoferrin, and sodium carbonate peroxide. Lactoferrin is an anti-inflammatory protein that binds the ferrous iron ions surrounding micro-organisms regulating bacterial growth. Hence, these products can be included as an adjunct to toothbrushing after oral surgeries and in the treatment of conditions like gingival inflammation and peri-implantitis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of oxygen-enriched mouthwash as a pre-procedural mouth rinse against oral microbes in the aerosol produced during ultrasonic scaling. Materials and methods A total of 40 patients with an age range of 20-40 years who have been advised to undergo ultrasonic scaling were selected as study subjects and were randomly allocated to group 1 (test group; n = 20; blue®m mouthwash) and group 2 (control group; n = 20; chlorhexidine). After evaluating the initial bacterial load after the use of water (placebo) as pre-rinse on the patient's chest and shoulder areas in both experimental and control groups, both the group subjects were instructed to gargle with 10 ml of the provided mouth rinse for one minute before ultrasonic scaling procedure. Blood agar plates were placed at the patient's chest and shoulder area to collect the aerosol and were later incubated to assess the colony-forming units (CFUs). An independent t-test was done to compare the CFUs between the groups. Results The mean initial bacterial load after the use of water (placebo) as pre-rinse on the patients' chest area (122.4 ± 0.6) and shoulder area (109.3 ± 2.6) in the experimental group was similar to the bacterial load seen on the chest area (126.2 ± 4.8) and shoulder area (115.4 ± 3.8) in the control group. The CFUs found in blood agar plates placed on the chest (59.8 ± 2.5) and shoulder (35.3 ± 3.6) areas of patients in group 1 were less as compared to CFUs found in blood agar plates placed on the chest (104.8 ± 3.2) and shoulder (75.3 ± 2.8) areas of patients in group 2. The difference between both groups was statistically significant with a p-value of ≤0.05. Conclusion There is a reduction in the bacterial load in the aerosols that are emitted during the ultrasonic scaling procedure with the use of oxygen-enriched mouthwash as a pre-procedural rinse when compared with chlorhexidine."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Neutropenic fever remains a major complication in acute leukemia. Decolonization is assumed as a promising intervention for eradicating causative agents of infection. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 96 patients with acute leukemia were assigned randomly to mupirocin nasal drop 2% (n = 32), chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2% (n = 33), and control group (n = 31). In control group, patients did not receive any medication for decolonization. All patients received treatment for 5 days (2 days prior to chemotherapy until 3 days after chemotherapy). Pharynx and nasal swabs were taken prior to the intervention and at the end of decolonization period in all groups. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the disc diffusion method in order to identify bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Bacterial recovery of both nasal and pharynx swabs was observed after global decolonization with mupirocin nasal drop. Decolonization with mupirocin significantly eradicated Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) in both nasal and pharynx swabs (p-value = 0.000). Moreover, mupirocin decreased Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) species. Chlorhexidine mouthwash significantly eradicated CONS in pharynx swabs (p-value = 0.000). In addition, both decolonization strategies decreased both antibiotic use and frequency of fever in leukemic patients. CONCLUSION: Global decolonization with mupirocin nasal drop not only eradicates both nasal and pharynx microorganisms, but also reduces antibiotic requirement and frequency of fever in patients with acute leukemia. The protocol of the present study was approved on December 2016 (registry number: IRCT20160310026998N6).",

      "abstract": "AIM: This study aimed at investigating the efficacy of a 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride-0.05% chlorhexidine (CPC-CHX) mouthwash in reducing viral load in the saliva as compared with sterile water. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were asked to dispense 4 mL of saliva. Half the patients rinsed for 60 s with 15 mL CPC-CHX, and the remaining patients rinsed with sterile water (control). Four millilitres of saliva were collected after 15, 30 and 60 min after rinsing. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were performed. For ELISA, the intact (representing the active virus) to total virus load (I/T) was calculated. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 copy numbers/mL from RT-qPCR tended to decrease in the control group, whereas in the CPC-CHX group, an increase was observed after T30. However, mixed linear model analysis revealed no statistical differences between groups (p = .124), time points (p = .616) and vaccinated or non-vaccinated patients (p = .953). Similarly, no impact of group (p = .880), time points (p = .306) and vaccination (p = .711) was observed for I/T ratio values. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitation of this study, there was no evidence that the intervention reduced salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load during the course of 60 min. Therefore, commonly used pre-procedural rinsing might not be clinically relevant.",

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of Ayurvedic mouthwash \"Draksha Guduchyadi Kashaya\" in reducing the severity of oral side effects of chemo-radiation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This concurrent parallel randomized controlled study was conducted at Sir Sunderlal Hospital, BHU, on 70 HNSCC patients scheduled to undergo RT/CCRT. Patients who met the inclusion-exclusion criteria were enrolled, and 35 were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (Ayurveda) or the control group using a simple random technique (lottery method). Blinding was not implemented in this study. Patients in the intervention group (Ayurveda) were instructed to perform kavala with 50 ml of \"Draksha Guduchyadi Kashaya\" for 2 min, ten times daily, while the control group performed 2-min gargling with soda-salt mouthwash ten times daily. RESULTS: Out of the 70 patients enrolled, data from 60 patients were analyzed, revealing statistically significant differences in the onset of mucositis (p = 0.049), pharyngitis (p = 0.034), laryngitis (p = 0.009) and intensity of variables such as mucositis (p = 0.000), xerostomia (p = 0.046), pharyngitis (p = 0.002), laryngitis (p = 0.035), and pain (p = 0.000). These findings indicate that Ayurvedic mouthwash may be beneficial in managing the oral side effects of chemo-radiation in HNSCC. CONCLUSION: This AYUSH financially supported trial (Reg No: CTRI/2020/04/024672) demonstrates promise as a safe and cost-effective alternative for managing oral complications of RT/CCRT, offering complementary treatment for comprehensive cancer care."

Materials and Methods: Seventy-five individuals were recruited according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This study was structured into two distinct phases. Phase I was a combination of toothbrushing using toothpaste containing fluoride (Protocol A), while Phase II toothbrushing included fluoride toothpaste and use of a mouthwash (Protocol B). For Phase II, individuals participating in this study were allocated into different groups through a randomization process: Group 1-0.12% CHX, Group 2-5% MC, and Group 3-4% OS. Each individual's Phase I and Phase II scores were assessed. GCF was measured in three phases to determine the level of inflammatory biomarkers. The paired t-test evaluated the disparities between the pre- and post-plaque index. Categorical data were subjected to crosstab analysis to assess qualitative variables. The mean values of cytokine levels were presented. An unpaired t-test was employed to assess the levels of cytokines between individuals in Phase I and Phase II. Results: Toothbrushing, fluoride toothpaste, and the supplementary use of mouthwash (Phase II) resulted in mean plaque scores significantly lower than group A (p < 0.001). Cytokines TNF-α, IL-α, and IL-β demonstrated a significant downward trend in herbal mouthwash users. Conclusions: In conjunction with fluoridated toothpaste and brushing, OS and MC can serve as a viable alternative to conventional synthetic mouthwash CHX. This combination demonstrates reducing mean plaque scores and diminishing the levels of cytokines TNF-α, IL-α, and IL-β.",

Various nanoemulsion-based mouthwashes of C. longa extract were produced using an aqueous phase titration approach via construction of pseudoternary phase diagrams. The developed nanoemulsion-based PHFX was studied for thermodynamic stability tests. Selected formulations (PHFX1-PHFX5) were characterized physicochemically for droplet diameter, polydispersity index (PDI), refractive index (RI), transmittance, and pH. The drug release studies were performed using the dialysis method. Based on the minimum droplet diameter (26.34 nm), least PDI (0.132), optimal RI (1.337), maximum %T (99.13), optimal pH (6.45), and maximum cumulative drug release (98.2%), formulation PHFX1 (containing 0.5% w/w of C. longa extract, 1.5% w/w of clove oil, 7.0% w/w of Tween-80, 7.0% w/w of Transcutol-HP, and 84.0% w/w of water) was selected for antimicrobial studies in comparison to standard CHD-A. The antibacterial effects and minimum inhibitory concentration were studied against various Gram-positive oral pathogens such as Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative oral pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The antibacterial effects of PHFX1 were found to be significant over standard CHD-A against most Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral pathogens. The antimicrobial studies showed that the formulation PHFX1 was effective against all oral pathogens even at 3- to 4-fold lower working concentrations.

Rose water is the main product of Rosa damascena which is a popular medicinal plant and has been widely used in alternative medicine. It has antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria which can potentially cause VAP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a randomized, controlled, single-center trial. 88 patients in a 21-bed surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) who were under mechanical ventilation met the inclusion criteria, and 80 patients fulfilled the study. Based on receiving either rose water and chlorhexidine solution or chlorhexidine solution alone, the patients were divided into two groups of control and intervention. The incidence of VAP up to 14 days was the primary outcome. Duration of mechanical ventilation, the ICU length of stay, and mortality in ICU were the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in demographic data, the incidence of VAP, the incidence of late-onset VAP, mechanical ventilation days, length of the ICU stay, and mortality between the two groups. However, the incidence of early-onset VAP in the intervention group was significantly lower than in the control group (p= 0.021). CONCLUSION: Rose water mouthwash significantly reduced the risk of early-onset VAP without any effect on late-onset VAP."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data obtained from 8 previously performed phase III studies, carried out to document the clinical efficacy of a mouthwash of delmopinol HCl 0.2% with respect plaque and gingivitis, were used to analyse the use of concomitant medication. In these 8 randomised double-blind clinical phase III studies the patients were - in addition to their normal oral hygiene measures - treated for 2-6 months with mouthwashes containing delmopinol HCl 0.2%, delmopinol HCl 0.1%, chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% or placebo. The number of visits in each study was three. Each time the patients visited the dentist for efficacy determinations, other data were also recorded. One of these was whether the patient had used any other medication during the study. In this paper, the number of treatments of different types of concomitant medication (antibiotics, nasal decongestants and others) was used as a basis for statistical comparisons between the different test groups. RESULTS: For antibiotics (all indications), a 27% lower number of treatments was obtained in the delmopinol 0.2% group in comparison with the placebo group, and a 41% decrease was observed for treatments with antibiotics for respiratory infections. For nasal decongestants, the number of treatments was 53% lower in the delmopinol 0.2% group. CONCLUSIONS: The delmopinol HCl 0.2% solution in patients with gingivitis provided a statistically significant reduction of concomitant use of antibiotics and nasal decongestants.",

METHODS: The novel herbal mouthwash used in the present study wa prepared from extracts of five plants namely Emblica Officinalis, Terminalia chebula, Terminalia bellerica, Glycyrrhiza glabra, and Azadirachta indica. 50 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to two groups. As per allocation, they were instructed to use either herbal mouthwash or chlorhexidine mouthwash twice daily for two weeks after nonsurgical periodontal therapy. Similarly, patients with radiation-induced mucositis were randomly given herbal mouthwash and soda saline mouthwash. Intergroup and intragroup comparisons of continuous variables were conducted using paired and unpaired t-tests. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. RESULTS: Significant reductions in gingival bleeding, plaque accumulation, and pocket depth were noticed in periodontitis patients in both groups. Patients reported acceptable taste, freshness, and satisfaction after the use of herbal mouthwash. The herbal mouthwash group noticed a significant reduction in the severity of radiation-induced mucositis and analgesic requirements. The intensity of pain, dryness of mouth, oral hygiene, and need for the use of antibiotic and antifungal during radiotherapy was not significant among the groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary clinical trial support the use of the tested herbal formulation mouthwash as an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis as well as radiation-induced mucositis.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Radiotherapy-induced xerostomia (RIX) is one of the most common adverse effects of radiotherapy (RT) in head and neck cancer patients (HNC) and a major determinant of survivors' quality of life. The primary objective was to evaluate the reduction of patients' xerostomia symptoms after the utilisation of a sodium-hyaluronate mouthwash compared to a placebo solution. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the improvement of quality of life and to evaluate the patients' satisfaction. METHODS: The protocol was approved by the ethical committee (Ref. 50,053/19) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT05103124). The study was a double-blind randomised clinical trial (RCT) with a crossover design and was conducted at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli, Rome. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients completed the study protocol. Lower values of the modified Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ) were retrieved when comparing the baseline scores to the ones after the treatment, when compared with placebo (Mann-Whitney U test = 0.01); higher values of patients' satisfaction (Likert scale) and modified XQ were retrieved for the sodium-hyaluronate mouthwash (Mann-Whitney U test = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This RCT highlights the advantages of treating RIX with the sodium-hyaluronate mouthwash since it seems to be clinically effective in reducing its symptoms, without any reported adverse events.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) for a lengthy period of time. The novel coronavirus is primarily spread via aerosols at a short distance, with infected individuals releasing large amounts of aerosols when speaking and coughing. However, there is an open question regarding whether mouthwash could effectively reduce virus transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic and support the prevention of infection among medical workers. METHODS: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were systematically searched from the inception of each database to January 12, 2023 for currently available randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the effect of mouthwash on novel coronavirus load in the oral cavity in COVID-19 patients. The treatment group received mouthwash for rinsing the mouth, while the control group received a placebo or distilled water for COVID-19 patients. The primary outcomes were CT value and viral load. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to minimize the bias and the impact of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs were included. Seven studies reported the intervention effect of mouthwash on the CT value of novel coronavirus. The analysis results showed that the mouthwash group had a positive impact on the CT value of novel coronavirus [ SMD = 0.35, 95% CI (0.21, 0.50)] compared with the control group. In addition, subgroup analysis showed a significant positive effect of mouthwash on CT values in the treatment group compared with the control group, with chlorhexidine (CHX) [SMD = 0.33, 95% CI (0.10, 0.56)], povidone-iodine (PVP-I) [SMD = 0.61, 95% CI (0.23, 0.99)], or hydrogen peroxide (HP) [SMD = 1.04, 95% CI (0.30, 1.78)] as an ingredient of the mouthwash. Six studies reported the intervention effect of mouthwash on the viral load, 263 cases in the treatment group and 164 cases in the control group. The analysis results showed that there was no statistical difference between the mouthwash group and the control group in the viral load of novel coronavirus [SMD = -0.06, 95% CI (-0.18, 0.05)]. In the subgroup analysis by measurement time, there were statistically significant differences between the mouthwash and control groups for CT values [SMD = 0.52, 95% CI (0.31, 0.72)] and viral load [SMD =  - 0.32, 95% CI (- 0.56, - 0.07)] within 30 min of gargling. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, mouthwash has some efficacy in reducing the viral load of novel coronavirus, especially within 30 min after rinsing the mouth. Mouthwash containing CHX, PVP-I and HP all had significant positive effects on CT values, and PVP-I-containing mouthwash may be a promising option to control novel coronavirus infections and relieve virus-related symptoms. However, studies on the dose and frequency of use of mouthwash for infection control are still lacking, which may limit the clinical application of mouthwash.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gingivitis is frequently painless, rarely causes spontaneous bleeding and is manifested by minor clinical changes. Therefore, most patients are unaware of the disease or do not seek treatment, as it is asymptomatic. Several methods for removing microbial plaque have been proposed, including mechanical and chemical ones. Amla or Indian gooseberry is a medicinal herb; its secondary metabolites, such as phenolic acid, flavonoids and terpenoids, can be used to preferentially reduce metal ions and form nanoparticles (NPs). Green synthesis with the use of the amla seed extract is a unique approach for the production of graphene oxide (GO)-silver (Ag) nanocomposite mouthwash. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to prepare an amla seed-mediated GO-Ag nanocomposite mouthwash, and to assess its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory efficacy in plaque-induced gingivitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted among 30 gingivitis patients. The patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups based on the intervention: group A (n = 15; nanocomposite mouthwash); and group B - control (n = 15; 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash). Clinical parameters, including the plaque index (PI), the gingival index (GI), a microbiological parameter - colony forming units (CFUs), and a biochemical parameter - the C-reactive protein (CRP) level in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), were assessed at baseline and at 15 days. RESULTS: The study results showed statistically significant differences in the mean PI and GI scores, and the CRP levels in the post-intervention period as compared to baseline in both groups. After the intervention period of 15 days, there were statistically significant differences between the 2 study groups in terms of mean PI and GI scores, and CRP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The amla seed-mediated GO-Ag nanocomposite mouthwash efficiently reduced plaque, gingival inflammation and CFUs among patients with plaque-induced gingivitis, but was not equivalent to the CHX mouthwash.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of a low concentration of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) mouthwash on salivary bacteria remained unclear. We aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effects of 100 ppm HOCl mouthwash on salivary bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), in patients with periodontal disease (PD). METHODS: Patients with PD were randomized into mouthwash-only (MW, n = 26) and mouthwash with periodontal flosser (MWPF, n = 27) groups. Patients without PD were selected for the control group (n = 30). S. aureus culture and saliva samples (before and after the intervention) were collected for bacterial DNA extraction. A real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of S. aureus culture and saliva samples were used to measure the salivary bacteria total count (SBTC) and confirm the antibacterial effects of the mouthwash using S. aureus. RESULTS: No significant difference in demographic data was observed among the three groups. Before the intervention, the baseline SBTC of the MW and MWPF groups was significantly higher than that of the control group. After the mouthwash rinses, the SBTC data significantly changed in the MW and MWPF groups only (by 62.4% and 77.4%, respectively). After the base-2 log-transformation of the SBTC data, a similar trend was observed. Linear regression revealed that baseline SBTC and the MWPF intervention significantly affected SBTC reduction percentage by volume. After incubation with 10% (v/v) of mouthwash, the survival rates of 106 and 107 colony-forming units/mL of S. aureus were 0.51% ± 0.06% and 1.42% ± 0.37%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These study results indicated that 100 ppm HOCl mouthwash treatment could effectively reduce SBTC in patients with PD and the abundance of S. aureus. It provides that the HOCl mouthwash can be an option for individuals to help control SBTC, especially in patients with PD.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: No standard approach other than oral care is available for preventing chemotherapy-induced stomatitis in patients with breast cancer. In this randomized, controlled phase 2 trial, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a dexamethasone-based mouthwash in preventing chemotherapy-induced stomatitis in patients with early breast cancer. BASIC PROCEDURES: Patients with breast cancer scheduled for epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) or docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) therapy were selected and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control groups. The intervention group received chemotherapy, oral care, and a dexamethasone-based mouthwash, whereas the control group received chemotherapy and oral care. The primary endpoint was the incidence of stomatitis. This was a phase 2 study, and the significance level for the analysis of the primary endpoint was set a priori at 0.2. MAIN FINDINGS: Data pertaining to 58 patients in the control group and 59 patients in the intervention group were analyzed. Stomatitis incidence was 55% and 38% in the control and intervention groups, respectively (risk ratio, 0.68; 80% confidence interval, 0.52-0.88; P = .052). Stomatitis severity was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (P = .03). The proportion of patients who adhered to the mouthwash regimen was 87% (interquartile range, 67.8%-95.3%). No severe oral infections were observed. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: The dexamethasone-based mouthwash safely reduced stomatitis incidence and severity in patients receiving chemotherapy for early breast cancer. Phase 3 clinical trials are warranted for validating our results.",

Alignment of national and international information on preventive oral care provided on websites, e.g. from the World Dental Federation and the International Federation of Dental Hygienists, seems necessary. It was also found that the oral hygiene behaviour of patients with periodontitis changed after initial treatment: they brushed longer daily and used an electric toothbrush, wooden toothpicks, and interdental brushes more often. Based on research with single-brushing exercises the electric toothbrush was found to be more effective than the manual toothbrush with respect to plaque reduction. If a chlorhexidine mouthwash is recommended, it can be used without creating problems before or after toothbrushing with a sodium lauryl sulphate dentifrice. Chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride may be simultaneously present in the same mouthwash without reducing chlorhexidine efficacy.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 60 patients who visited M dental clinic located in Busan, South Korea, excluding those with systemic disease that may induce halitosis. There were 30 patients classified to the saline gargle group and the remaining 30 patients were classified to the G. uralensis extract gargle group. In addition, their level of halitosis and halitosis-causing bacteria were measured. They visited the dental clinic on a fasted state at baseline before gargle application (Baseline), immediately after gargle application (Treatment) and 5 days after gargle application (After 5 Days). For clinical indicators, participants were tested for halitosis and bacteria immediately after waking up without brushing their teeth and without hydration. RESULTS: The prevalence of halitosis decreased in the G. uralensis extract gargle group compared to the saline gargle group at Treatment and After 5 Days. In cases with pseudo halitosis, there was a significant decrease in halitosis-causing bacteria when G. uralensis extract gargle was applied (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It was identified that using a mouthwash made with G. uralensis extract is effective for halitosis improvement and reduction of halitosis-causing bacteria. Therefore, using a mouthwash containing G. uralensis extract, it will be effective in improving bad breath and oral hygiene will be possible.",

METHODS: Databases including Medline, Embase and bibliographies were searched from inception to 1 April 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 7 days or longer duration of oil pulling with edible oils in comparison to chlorhexidine or other mouthwashes or oral hygiene practice concerning the parameters of plaque index scores (PI), gingival index scores (GI), modified gingival index scores (MGI) and bacteria counts were included. Cochrane's Risk of Bias (ROB) tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework were employed to determine the quality of evidence. Two authors independently conducted study selection and data extraction. Meta-analyses of the effect of oil pulling on the parameters were conducted using an inverse-variance random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-five trials involving 1184 participants were included. Twenty-one trials comparing oil pulling (n = 535) to chlorhexidine (n = 286) and non-chlorhexidine intervention (n = 205) were pooled for meta-analysis. More than half of the trials (n = 17) involved participants with no reported oral health issues. The duration of intervention ranged from 7 to 45 days, with half of the trials using sesame oil. When compared to non-chlorhexidine mouthwash interventions, oil pulling clinically and significantly improved MGI scores (Standardized mean difference, SMD = -1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.31, -0.97). Chlorhexidine was more effective in reducing the PI scores compared to oil pulling, with an SMD of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.49). The overall quality of the body of evidence was very low. CONCLUSIONS: There was a probable benefit of oil pulling in improving gingival health. Chlorhexidine remained superior in reducing the amount of plaque, compared to oil pulling. However, there was very low certainty in the evidence albeit the clinically beneficial effect of oil pulling intervention.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment with mild-to-moderate gingivitis were selected for the study. The patients were randomly divided into three groups of twenty each, that is, group I: 0.25% lemongrass oil mouthwash (n = 20); group II: 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash (n = 20); and group III: oral prophylaxis (n = 20). Baseline gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were accessed followed by oral prophylaxis was done and the PI score was set to zero for all the patients. Patients were asked to swish their mouth with their respective mouthwashes and brushing (twice daily), that is, morning and before bedtime for 21 days. The PI and GI scores were recorded for all three groups on the 14th and the 21st days. The post hoc Bonferroni test was used for multiple comparisons of mean differences among variables after the application of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test for comparison within the groups. RESULTS: A lower PI and the GI were found in the lemongrass oil mouthwash group by the 14th and the 21st days, respectively, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) compared to the chlorhexidine mouthwash group. CONCLUSION: The findings of the current study suggested that 0.25% lemongrass oil mouthwash has the potential to be used as a natural or herbal alternative to chlorhexidine mouthwash.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Zinc L-carnosine promotes the transition from the inflammatory to the proliferative phase of wound healing by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory signals and enhancing the expression of anti-inflammatory signals. This prospective cohort study aims to test the effect of a zinc-L-carnosine mouthwash in promoting oral surgical wound healing. METHODS: From October 2022 to February 2023, the authors enrolled healthy adult volunteers who needed the extraction of bilateral molars at the Unit of Dentistry of the University of Bari. The authors studied the baseline wound healing of each patient after the first extraction. Three months later, the patients underwent the second extraction and rinsed their mouths with zinc-L-carnosine mouthwash twice per day for the following 28 postoperative days. For a month after each extraction, the patients received weekly follow-up visits by an oral surgeon blinded about the study to record the modified healing index score of the wounds (range 0-6 points). For statistical analysis, we used the one-tailed t-test for paired samples with a significance level set at p < 0.05 to compare the baseline scores with those recorded during the exposure to the zinc-L-carnosine mouthwash. RESULTS: The authors enrolled four women and six men (mean age = 44.60 ± 19.22 years). On the seventh and fourteenth postoperative days, the mean difference between the modified healing index scores obtained by using the zinc-L-carnosine mouthwash and the baseline was not significant. On the twenty-first postoperative day, the mean score obtained by using the mouthwash was 5.2 ± 1.3 points and was significantly higher than the 4.7 ± 1.8 points of the baseline (p = 0.026). On the twenty-eighth postoperative day, the mean difference was significant as well (5.9 ± 0.3 points and 5.4 ± 1.1 points, respectively). CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of this study showed that the zinc-L-carnosine mouthwash improved the quality of oral surgical wound healing."

SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial. Thirty patients with fixed orthodontic appliances were randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio, to either the mastic-mouthwash or the placebo-mouthwash group. Eligibility criteria included ages between 13 and 18, active orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances, good general health, and total initial VSCs levels above 150 ppb. The primary outcome was the objective hydrogen sulfide (H2S) level, measured with the Oral ChromaTM device. The secondary outcomes were (1.) the methyl-mercaptan (CH3SH) and (2.) dimethyl sulfide [(CH3)2S] levels, measured with the same device, (3.) the subjective perception of the own malodour via questionnaires, and (4.) the oral hygiene assessed with the use of the Modified Silness and Löe Plaque Index (PI-M) and the Silness and Löe Gingival Index (GI) at baseline (T0) and after 2 weeks (T1). Stratified randomization by gender was used, and allocation was concealed with opaque numbered sealed envelopes. RESULTS: H2S level dropped from 221.00 ppb (T0) to 125.00 ppb (T1), and the difference between treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of the mastic group (coef: 72.34, 95% CI: 8.48, 136.27, P = 0.03). The levels of the other VSCs, the subjective measurements of oral malodour, and the oral hygiene indices did not differ between treatment arms. LIMITATIONS: The objective organoleptic assessment by a calibrated examiner was not performed. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Mastic mouthwashes could be an alternative treatment for adolescent patients suffering from halitosis during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT05647369).",

This project evaluated the prevalence of the newly identified oral pathogen Scardovia wiggsiae before and after this procedure to determine any measurable effects. Using an approved protocol, n = 36 pre-mouthwash patient samples, n = 36 matched post-mouthwash samples, and n = 36 matched recall samples were identified (total sample number n = 108). DNA was isolated from each sample (pre-, post-mouthwash, and recall). Screening using qPCR and validated primers revealed n = 10/36 or 27.8% tested positive for Scardovia among the pre-mouthwash (Sample A) isolates with n = 3/36 or 8.3% testing positive among the post-mouthwash (Sample B) isolates. Screening of the recall (Sample C) samples has revealed n = 10/36, or 27.8% once again tested positive for Scardovia, demonstrating that this pathogen was found among a significant proportion of pediatric patient samples. Moreover, the COVID-19-related procedure of requiring sustained mouth washing prior to clinical treatment appears to reduce the levels of detectable Scardovia, at least initially. However, this study found no long-term effects using this isolated protocol."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of a mouthwash containing Lespedeza cuneata extract (LCE) on halitosis as an alternative to chemical mouthwashes. The effect of this natural mouthwash on halitosis-causing bacteria (HCB) was clinically evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 subjects among 103 participants were recruited from the M Dental Clinic (Busan, South Korea) in this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The participants were divided into two groups: 41 in the saline-gargle group (saline group) and 43 in the LCE-gargle group (LCE group). A week before the experiment, scaling and oral health education were conducted to standardise the subjects' oral condition. For clinical evaluation, halitosis and HCB were evaluated pre-gargle (baseline), immediately after gargling (treatment), and 5 days after gargling (5 days post-treatment). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows. RESULTS: The level of subjective improvement was statistically significantly greater in the LCE group than the saline group (p < 0.05). Compared with the saline group, the LCE group showed reduced halitosis after 5 days of application. Furthermore, halitosis statistically significantly decreased over time (p < 0.05). Moreover, the LCE group showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of all six HCBs (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: LCE gargle was effective in reducing halitosis both subjectively and objectively, suggesting an antibacterial effect on HCBs in the oral cavity. Thus, LCE, which can be used as a safe mouthwash ingredient, can promote oral health and will be valuable for the oral healthcare product industry. It might also be helpful for people suffering from halitosis.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Self-reported cigarette smokers and non-smokers with periodontal inflammation as well as non-smokers with a healthy periodontal status were included. NSPT was performed in all participants. Based on the type of mouthwash, participants were randomly divided into three groups as follows: group 1: CHX; group 2: SPM; and group 3: distilled water (ddH2O) with mint flavour (control group). Clinical attachment loss (CAL), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and marginal bone loss (MBL) were measured. Clinical periodontal parameters were re-assessed at a 6-week follow-up. Oral yeast samples were collected and identified using a concentrated oral-rinse culture technique and PCR, respectively. Clinical and laboratory-based investigations were done at baseline and after six weeks. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: At baseline, PI, MBL, PD and CAL were comparable in all participants. None of the patients had periodontitis at baseline. Post-operatively, CHX and SPM were more effective in reducing PI (p < 0.01), GI (p < 0.01) and PD (p < 0.01) in non-smokers than in the control group. The OCC was statistically significantly higher among smokers compared with non-smokers at baseline. At the 6-month follow-up, CHX was more effective than SPM in reducing OCC in non-smokers (p < 0.01). At the 6-week follow-up, there was no difference in OCC among cigarette smokers regardless of the type of mouthwash prescribed postoperatively. CONCLUSION: In cigarette smokers and non-smokers, CHX and SPM are effective in reducing periodontal soft-tissue inflammation after NSPT. Post-operative use of CHX is more effective than SPM in reducing OCC.",

MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this randomized, investigator-blind, positive-controlled trial, OLP patients with erosive lesions received betamethasone mouthwash (0.137 mg/mL) or dexamethasone mouthwash (0.181 mg/mL) three times daily for 2 or 4 weeks and were followed up for 3 months to observe recurrence. The primary outcome was the week-2 reduction in erosive area. RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants were randomized to betamethasone (n = 29) and dexamethasone (n = 28). At week 2, participants using betamethasone (n = 28) experienced a greater reduction in erosive area than gargling with dexamethasone (n = 26). Similarly, secondary outcomes, including the healing proportion of erosions, reduced pain level, reduction in atrophic area, Thongprasom score, and recurrence interval, showed the superiority of betamethasone. At week 4, betamethasone (n = 7) was not superior to dexamethasone (n = 15) in further reducing lesional area and pain level. No serious adverse events were documented. CONCLUSIONS: The 0.137 mg/mL compound betamethasone mouthwash exhibited significant efficacy in rapidly enhancing erosion healing within 2 weeks and extending the recurrence interval with a good safety profile. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study proved the significant efficacy of short-course 0.137 mg/mL betamethasone mouthwash therapy for treating erosion and pain, providing a novel topical agent for patients with severe EOLP.

During radiotherapy, patients develop severe oral mucositis, which leads to oral pain and difficulty in eating and interruption of radiotherapy, affects the treatment effect and increase the probability of recurrence. Although we have explored various methods to reduce the mucosal damage caused by radiotherapy, these methods still cannot reduce pain caused by mucositis clinically. Therefore, the use of Dexamethasone-Lidocaine-Vitamin B12 Mouth rinse (DLVBM) proved its role in reducing oral mucosal pain, reducing the weight loss of patients, and completing radiotherapy according to the course of treatment. 133 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who received radiotherapy (a total dose of 70 Gy) in our hospital from January to December 2020-2021 were selected. 67 patients received DLVBM treatment for mucositis reaction, and 66 patients received Compound chlorhexidine mouthwash (CCM) to deal with mucositis. Symptoms related to oral mucosal pain score and body weight, mucosal healing time were analyzed retrospectively. We found that patients with the DLVBM group significantly reduced oral pain and reduced weight loss. However, there was no significant difference about the mucosal healing time between the DLVBM group and CCM group. DLVBM may be moderately more effective in preventing radiation-induced mucositis and mucositis-related pain, and their use may lead to less frequent RT course interruptions from mucositis."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective randomized clinical trial included 90 patients aged 12-35 years and in permanent dentition, who were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to three mouthwash groups: aloe vera, probiotic, or fluoride. Smartphone-based applications were used to improve patient compliance. The primary outcome was the change in S. mutans levels in plaque between two times: pre-intervention and after 30 days using real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Secondary outcomes were the evaluation of patient-reported outcomes and compliance. RESULTS: Mean differences between aloe vera vs probiotic: -0.53 (95% CI: -3.57 to 2.51), aloe vera vs fluoride: -1.99 (95% CI, -4.8 to 0.82), and probiotic vs fluoride: -1.46 (95% CI: -4.74 to 1.82) were not significant, P = .467.

Pilocarpine may be a useful medication for the treatment of xerostomia, but its side effects limit its use under certain conditions. Recent studies have focused on the pilocarpine mouthwash as an alternative. PURPOSE: We have undertaken this study to review the latest available scientific evidence systematically, concerning the effects of pilocarpine mouthwash on salivary flow rate in patients with xerostomia. MATERIALS AND METHOD: An electronic search for randomized controlled trials published in English until September 2021 related to pilocarpine mouthwash and salivary flow rate in patients with dry mouth was performed in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the groups. RESULTS: Two papers with 86 patients were selected for the final review based on strict eligibility criteria. According to the results of the meta-analysis, the mean visual analogue scale in the patient treated with pilocarpine mouthwash was 0.88 unit lower than that of the control group in the fourth week follow; however, it was not statistically significant (pooled mean difference=-0.88, 95% CI = (-2.72; 0.95), p= 0.34). CONCLUSION: It seems that the use of pilocarpine mouthwash can increase the salivary flow rates; however, no optimal dose and application regimen can currently be suggested due to the high heterogeneity of the data. Regarding the relief of the symptoms using pilocarpine mouthwash, the existing evidence does not support its effectiveness."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Curative intent treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC) is frequently radiation therapy over 7 weeks with concurrent chemotherapy. This regimen is effective but carries a burden of toxicity leading to severe pain and treatment breaks portending inferior outcomes. Conventional palliation methods include opioids, anticonvulsants and local anaesthetics. Breakthrough toxicities are nevertheless ubiquitous and present an urgent unmet need. Ketamine is an inexpensive drug with mechanisms of analgesia outside the opioid pathway including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism and a pharmacologically unique property of opioid desensitisation. Systemic ketamine is validated in randomised controlled trials for efficacy in reducing pain and/or opioid burden in the oncologic setting. Literature supports peripherally administered ketamine for pain control without systemic toxicity. These data support our rationale of using ketamine mouthwash to decrease acute toxicity of curative treatment of HNC, the efficacy of which is our aim to elucidate. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a phase II, Simon's two-stage trial. Patients have pathologically confirmed HNC and an intended regimen of 70 Gy of radiation with concurrent cisplatin. The protocol is initiated on diagnosis of grade 3 mucositis and consists of 2 weeks of 4 times daily (QID) ketamine mouthwash use. The primary endpoint is pain response defined as a combination of pain score and opioid use. 23 subjects will be enrolled in stage 1. If statistical criteria are met, 33 subjects will be enrolled in stage 2. Secondary endpoints include daily pain, daily opioid use, dysphagia at baseline and completion, nightly sleep quality, feeding tube placement and any unscheduled treatment breaks. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All trial data will be stored in an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved database. The protocol is registered under Northwell IRB registration number #22-0292 and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) approval has been granted under IND number 161609. Results are intended to be published in an open-source journal and further data, statistics and source documents are available on request. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05331131.",

The disease initiates with bacterial adherence to the tooth surface followed by the formation of dental plaques. Mutans streptococci and Candida albicans are principal oral microorganisms involved in the initiation and development of dental caries. Phytochemicals have been shown to possess promising antimicrobial properties against a wide range of microorganisms and can be used for the prevention and treatment of dental caries. Herein, we reviewed literature on plants that are traditionally used for their antimicrobial properties or possess promising anticariogenic activity. We selected aerial parts of Scrophularia striata (S. striata) and galls of Quercus infectoria (Q. infectoria) and investigated their antimicrobial activity against cariogenic microorganisms. METHODS: Water soluble fractions were obtained from hydroalcoholic extracts of S. striata and Q. infectoria and their antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus sobrinus (S. sobrinus), and Candida albicans (C. albicans) was evaluated separately and in combination. The extracts were then used for preparing an herbal mouthwash whose stability and tannic acid content were evaluated over 60 days. RESULTS: Q. infectoria gall extract possesses efficient antimicrobial activity that was synergistically enhanced in the presence of S. striata extract. Mouthwash prepared using these extracts showed desirable organoleptic characteristics, antimicrobial activity, and stability. CONCLUSION: Extracts of S. striata and Q. infectoria galls can be used together for preparing dental products with effective anticariogenic properties. Our study highlights the importance of extensive pharmacological investigations when using herbal products alone or in combination with other chemical substances."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most common nosocomial infections in intensive care units (ICUs), and the use of mouthwash is the most widely used method to prevent its incidence. The aim of this study was to investigate effect of clove mouthwash on the incidence of VAP in the ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This comparative, randomized, triple-blind, clinical trial was conducted on 168 eligible ICU patients at Kosar Hospital in Semnan, Iran, during 2021-2022, who were divided into intervention and control groups using random blocks. The intervention group received clove extract mouthwash at 6.66% concentration, and the control group received chlorhexidine 0.2% twice a day for 5 days (routine care). Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, and disease severity was measured based on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, oral health status was examined using the Beck Oral Assessment Scale (BOAS), and VAP diagnosis was made based on the Modified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (MCPIS). RESULTS: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference in disease severity (p = 0.412) and oral health status (p = 0.239) between the patients in the two groups. After the intervention, 20.2% of the patients in the intervention group and 41.7% of those in the control group acquired VAP. The risk of VAP was 2.06 times higher in the control group than in the intervention group (p = 0.005, 95% CI: 1.26-3.37, RR = 2.06), but the severity of VAP did not differ significantly between the patients in the two groups (p = 0.557). CONCLUSION: The findings showed that clove mouthwash reduces the incidence of VAP significantly. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clove mouthwash can be used as a simple and low-cost method to prevent VAP in ICU patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis (OM) is one of the most common adverse effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It greatly affects the patients' quality of life and hinders cancer treatment implementation. Treating OM with mouthwash is a widely used strategy that can effectively relieve symptoms and promote healing. However, the wide mouthwash selection confuses clinicians. This Bayesian network meta-analysis aimed to compare the effects of various mouthwash types used to treat OM and provide high-level evidence-based recommendations for OM treatment. METHODS: Database search included PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to April 21, 2022. The primary outcome was OM score improvement following the World Health Organization grades. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) bias risk assessment tool provided in the Cochrane Handbook assessed the studies' risk of bias. We performed pairwise and Bayesian network meta-analysis with random effects following the PRISMA guideline. RESULTS: The study included 13 RCTs with 570 patients. Pairwise comparisons showed that povidone-iodine was more effective than chlorhexidine (weighted mean difference [WMD], -2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.72 to -2.56) but inferior to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; WMD, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06-0.34) after one week of mouthwash treatment. Vitamin E (WMD, -0.94; 95% CI, -1.03 to -0.85), natural drugs (WMD, -0.93; 95% CI, -1.46 to -0.40), and phenytoin (WMD, -0.38; 95% CI, -0.59 to -0.17) exhibited better therapeutic effects than a placebo after three weeks of treatment. Bayesian network meta-analysis showed that povidone-iodine was superior to chlorhexidine in treating OM (WMD, 2.63; 95% CI, 0.20-5.01). Other mouthwashes showed no significant differences. Rank probability indicated that the best OM therapeutic mouthwashes were GM-CSF (54%), vitamin E (24%), and natural drugs (43%) after one, two, and three weeks of treatment, respectively. CONCLUSION: GM-CSF was the most effective mouthwash type for OM treatment. When considering the cost and effectiveness, povidone-iodine and sodium bicarbonate might be the most advantageous. Furthermore, natural drugs have the same potential in treating OM. Safety and acceptability are their most outstanding characteristic."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of thyme mouthwash on intraoral halitosis, gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) in patients with gingivitis. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 60 gingivitis patients (30 women/30 men) received initial periodontal treatment followed by oral hygiene instructions (OHI) and then were divided into four groups: The control group (C) received only OHI, while chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash was prescribed to the CHX group, Zinc acetate and CHX diacetate mouthwash was prescribed to the zinc acetate and CHX diacetate (ZnA) group, and the thyme (T) group was instructed to use thyme mouthwash. GI, PI and volatile sulfur compound (VSC) values were recorded at baseline and at the first week of treatment. RESULTS: The initial values of the recorded parameters did not differ significantly between the groups. In all groups, VSCs, GI and PI decreased after treatment (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference between the PI values of the groups after treatment (p = 0.188). On the contrary, the GI and VSC values after treatment were significantly different between the groups (p = 0.001). GI values were highest in the control group and lowest in the CHX group. In terms of VSCs, a significant difference was found between groups T and C, and between groups T and ZnA (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that the use of thyme mouthwash after periodontal treatment was effective in improving bad breath and gingivitis in gingivitis patients.",

The present study aimed to compare the effect of milk as a mouthwash with one anti-hypersensitivity mouthwash in decreasing dentin hypersensitivity after non-surgical periodontal treatment. Methods. Patients with generalized moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis were selected randomly in the present study and underwent scaling and root planing (SRP). Seventy patients with severe dentin hypersensitivity after two days were assigned to two groups. In group A, the patients were asked to use milk as a mouthwash, and in group B, the patients were asked to use anti-hypersensitiv-ity Misswake mouthwash. The patients' hypersensitivity was measured during follow-up visits. The independent t-test was used to compare denim hypersensitivity between the two groups. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. Results. The results showed a significant decrease in dentin hypersensitivity in both groups on days 15 and 30. In the milk group, 11 and 29 patients fully recovered from dentin hypersensitivity on days 15 and 30, respectively. However, in the anti-hypersensitivity mouthwash group, 8 and 27 patients fully recovered from dentin hypersensitivity on days 15 and 30, respectively. Therefore, more patients benefited from the anti-hypersensitivity effects of milk as a mouthwash. However, the differences were not significant during the whole treatment sessions. Conclusion. Using milk as an inexpensive and available mouthwash can decrease dentin hypersensi-tivity after SRP."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Effects of mouthwashes on the vitality of oral mucosal cells have not been determined in orthodontic patients. We aimed to assess, for the first time, the effects of fixed orthodontic treatment with and without chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash on the oral mucosal cell vitality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients meeting the eligibility criteria were consecutively included until the desired sample size was reached. Oral buccal mucosal cell samples were taken immediately before orthodontic treatment. For each patient, 20 metal brackets and 4 bands were installed on the teeth. Cell samples were recollected after one month of treatment. Then, the patients used an ethanol-free 0.12% CHX mouthwash two times a week for one month. Sampling was repeated at the end of the second month. Papanicolaou staining was used for micronucleus screening of the indexes: micronucleus (MIC), karyorrhexis (KR), karyolysis (KL), and broken eggs (BE). The repair index (RI) was calculated as RI=KR+KL/BE+MIC. Comparisons of nuclear changes over 3 intervals were done using the Friedman and Dunn-Bonferroni tests (α=0.05, β<0.05). RESULTS: This prospective before-after clinical trial was performed on 408 observations of 34 patients (14 males, 20 females, mean age: 16.68±3.75 years) at 3 intervals (×4 parameters each). The means of MIC, KR, KL, BE, and RI were respectively 1.312±1.219, 0.241±0.564, 0.426±0.657, 0.115±0.224, and 0.476±0.360 before treatment. They were 1.348±1.171, 0.215±0.236, 0.406±0.369, 0.124±0.187, and 0.511±0.310 at the first interval and 1.909±1.263, 0.368±0.174, 0.615±0.269, 0.253±0.150, and 0.529±0.195 at the second interval. Friedman showed significant time-dependent changes for all variables (P<0.0005) except RI. Dunn-Bonferroni showed that except MIC (P=0.017), KR/KL/BE changed insignificantly after orthodontic treatment (P≥0.974). MIC/KR/KL/BE increased significantly after the addition of CHX (P<0.0005). CONCLUSION: CHX mouthwash, together with orthodontic treatment, has a strong deteriorating effect on nuclear indexes associated with the vitality of buccal mucosal cells. Nuclear changes caused by orthodontic treatment alone might be negligible.",

However, only CPC + Zn reduced counts of the pathogen Prevotella intermedia and did not interfere with the levels of some beneficial species in relation to the negative control. The treatment of multispecies subgingival biofilm with CPC + Zn was effective in controlling periodontal pathogens and favored the colonization of health-associated bacterial species.",

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the antiseptic efficacy of a 0.05% chlorhexidine + 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash on toothbrushes. METHODS: A total of twelve toothbrushes used three times/day for 14 days by orally and systemically healthy people were randomly split into two groups, and their heads were immersed for 2 h in PBS (control) or Perio·Aid Active Control (treatment). The microorganisms were recovered, and their number was calculated by culture, quantitative PCR, and viability PCR. Statistical differences were first assessed with a two-way mixed ANOVA and subsequently with Student's t-test. RESULTS: The results showed no statistical differences in the total number of cells for the treatment (mean ± CI95% of 7.27 ± 1.09 log10 bacteria/ml) and the control (7.62 ± 0.64 log10 bacteria/ml) groups, but a significantly lower number of live cells in the treatment group (4.58 ± 0.61 log10 viable bacteria/ml and 2.15 ± 1.42 log10 cfu/ml) than in the control group (6.49 ± 1.39 log10 viable bacteria/ml and 5.04 ± 0.93 log10 cfu/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, sanitization of toothbrushes with this mouthwash reduces the number of live microorganisms adhered to the filaments. Such decrease of the bacterial load could include bacteria from the oral cavity, from the environment, and from nearby toothbrushes since the quantification was not limited to any bacterial taxon.",

The present study aims to investigate and compare the effects of synbiotic mouthwash with normal saline mouthwash on the prevention and control of radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis in oral cancer patients. METHODS: Double-blind, randomized clinical trial (RCT) performed on 64 oral cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy (IRCT20201106049288N1, registration date: 2020-12-23). Patients were divided randomly into the case (32 subjects) and control (32 subjects) groups. All patients underwent intensity-modulated radiotherapy and received 6000 cGY of radiotherapy in 34 fractions. All patients received the usual treatment for mucositis, but in the case group, synbiotic mouthwash was prescribed and in the control group, normal saline mouthwash was prescribed from a day before the start to the end of radiotherapy treatment. Patients were monitored every session for 6 weeks to check the progression, oral involvement severity, and mucositis grade. RESULTS: The case group showed a significant reduction in the oral mucositis severity. The mucositis grade in the case group from the 7th session of oral examination was significantly lower than the control (p < 0.05), and this significant difference persisted until the last session of oral examination. Incidence rates of severe oral mucositis (grade 3) during the treatment period were 11.59% in the case and 36.45% in control (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Synbiotic mouthwash significantly reduces and prevents oral mucositis intensity in oral cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.",

Methods: A randomized and single-blind clinical trial of 48 non-erosive and erosive OLP patients was conducted, with the patients divided into two groups. Group A was treated with dexamethasone plus gentamycin mouthwash and Group B received an additional TGP capsule together with the aforementioned mouthwash. All the patients were followed up with four times, at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The clinical manifestations, sign score, and VAS scale were recorded. The total effective rate (%) was defined as (cases of complete resolution + cases of partial resolution)/total cases observed × 100%. Results: A total of 43 patients completed all follow-up appointments. Among the 21 patients in Group A, the total effective rate was 61.9%. Of the 22 patients in Group B, the total effective rate was 89.66%. The clinical manifestation, sign score, and VAS of the two groups all indicated improvements, and there were significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Dexamethasone plus gentamycin mouthwash combined with TGP treatment for OLP patients is a safe and effective treatment of OLP."

The present study aimed to compare the effects of 1 and 2% pilocarpine mouthwash on xerostomic participants. METHODS: In this double-blind clinical trial study, 48 subjects with xerostomia were randomly divided into three groups to measure the effects of 1 and 2% pilocarpine and placebo mouthwashes on saliva levels. The amount of saliva in the 1st and 14th days was measured at 0, 45, 60, and 75 mins, while participants used their mouthwash three times a day for 14 days. On the 1st and 14th days, they filled out the information forms on xerostomia and the medicine's side effects before and after the intervention. RESULTS: On the 1st day, the mean salivary flow at 45, 60, and 75 mins in the 2 and 1% pilocarpine mouthwash were significantly higher than in the placebo mouthwash group (p < 0.05). On the 14th day, the mean salivary flow time at 45 mins in the 2% pilocarpine mouthwash group was significantly higher than in the placebo mouthwash group (p = 0.007). Furthermore, the mean salivary flow at 60 and 75 mins in the 2% (p < 0.001) and 1% pilocarpine mouthwash (p = 0.028) was significantly higher than in the placebo group. Moreover, the salivary flow in the 2% pilocarpine mouthwash group was significantly higher than the 1% pilocarpine mouthwash (p < 0.05) during these two times. No side effects were observed in any of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that 5 ml of 2 and 1% pilocarpine mouthwash for 2 weeks increased salivary flow in xerostomic participants compared to placebo without any side effects.",

For the same oral environments of 95 subjects who agreed to participate in this study, scaling was performed one week before the experiment. The final number of subjects included in the analysis was 82, excluding those who dropped out during the study period. A randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted by dividing the subjects into the Lespedeza cuneata extract gargle group (n = 42) and the saline gargle group (n = 40). Participants in each group gargled once every day before going to bed for 5 days, and data were collected by measuring 3 times: before gargling (Baseline), immediately after gargling (Treatment), and 5 days after gargling (After 5 Days). Two trained dental hygienists confirmed the dental caries activity through the Cariview test under the guidance of a dentist. Microbiological analysis was performed to evaluate the changes in bacteria causing dental caries. By confirming the anti-caries effect in the oral environment according to the application of Lespedeza cuneata extract gargle, dental caries activity was found to be significantly lower from Treatment to After 5 Days (p < 0.05). Dental caries-causing bacteria in the upper and lower jaws were also significantly reduced (p < 0.05). These results confirm that Lespedeza cuneata extract is a natural substance with an anti-caries effect. Gargling with a mouthwash containing Lespedeza cuneata extract is useful in preventing dental caries and inhibiting its progression. The same mouthwash can also be used as an effective formulation for maintaining and promoting oral health.",

Atorvastatin is a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and various studies have proven its anti-inflammatory effects. The goal of this study was to evaluate atorvastatin 1% mouthwash effects in prevention of radiotherapy-induced mucositis. METHODS: Atorvastatin 1% suspension was prepared for mouthwash in this randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Thirty patients randomly received atorvastatin or placebo mouthwash. They had to gargle 5cc of mouthwash, 3 times per day during radiotherapy. The severity and pain of mucositis was evaluated every week, during their treatment. RESULTS: The severity of mucositis between the two study groups was significant every four weeks (p<0.05) and the percentage of patients with more severe mucositis was less in the atorvastatin group. It is found that the pain intensity was lower after 3 and 4 weeks in atorvastatin group. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that atorvastatin mouthwash showed a significant activity in relieving of radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis and pain."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Self-reported current cigarette-smokers and never-smokers with periodontal inflammation were included. All patients underwent non-surgical periodontal therapy. Patients were divided into 2 subgroups. In the test- and control-group, patients were advised to rinse with a Salvadora persica-based mouthwash and a non-alcoholic 0.12% CHX twice daily for 2-weeks, respectively. Full-mouth plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (AL) and whole salivary IL-1β were measured at baseline and at 3-months' follow-up. Significance was set at p<0.01. RESULTS: 34 cigarette-smokers and 34 never-smokers were included. At 3-months of follow-up, PI, PD, and clinical AL were comparable with their respective baseline values among cigarette-smokers. In never-smokers, there was a significant reduction in scores of PI (p<0.01), GI (p<0.01) and PD (p<0.01) at 3-months of follow-up compared with baseline. At 3-months of follow-up, there was no significant difference in PI, GI, PD, and clinical AL among never-smokers in the test- and control-groups. Among never-smokers, there was a significant reduction in whole salivary IL-1β levels at 3-months' follow-up (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Usage of 0.12% CHX or a S. persica-based mouthwash following NSPT is ineffective in controlling periodontal inflammation and reducing whole salivary IL-1β in young light cigarette-smokers compared with never-smokers.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of an enzyme-based mouthwash on the amount of dental biofilm and the composition of the salivary microbiome in patients undergoing treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances. TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 35 young adolescents (14-18 years) under treatment with fixed appliances were consecutively enrolled and randomly allocated to an experimental or a placebo group by opening a computer-generated numbered envelope. The subjects were instructed to rinse twice daily during an intervention period of 8 days with experimental mouthwash or placebo without active enzymes. Unstimulated whole saliva samples were collected at baseline and after 8 days. The participants and examiner were blinded for the allocation. The primary outcome was the Orthodontic Plaque Index (OPI) and the secondary was the composition of the salivary microbiome. RESULTS: In total, 28 adolescents (21 females and 7 males) completed the trial and there were no differences in age, clinical, or microbial findings between the test (n = 14) and the placebo group (n = 14) at baseline. We found a decreased OPI in the test group after 8 days and the difference was statistically significant compared with the placebo group (P < 0.05). There were no significant treatment effects on the richness and global composition of the salivary microbiome. HARMS: In total, one participant in the test group claimed nausea and abandoned the project. In total, two participants did not like the taste of the mouthwash but used it as instructed. No other adverse events or side effects were reported. LIMITATIONS: Short-term pilot trials may by nature be sensitive for selection and performance biases and are not designed to unveil persisting effects. CONCLUSION: Daily use of enzyme-containing mouthwash reduced the amount of dental biofilm in adolescents under treatment with the fixed orthodontic appliances, without affecting the composition of the salivary microbiota.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of turmeric mouthwash on oral health status and onset and severity of treatment-induced oral mucositis and associated oral dysfunctions among head and neck cancer patients. METHODS: A randomized controlled design was adopted (CTRI/2018/06/014367). Turmeric mouthwash was administered to the experimental group (n = 46) and benzydamine mouthwash was given to the control group (n = 46). Oral health status and mucositis were graded using the Oral Health Assessment Tool and the World Health Organization oral toxicity criteria, respectively. Oral dysfunctions were measured by a patient-reported oral mucositis symptom scale and xerostomia short-form inventory. All outcome variables were measured weekly during the entire course of radiation therapy. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable with regard to their demographic and outcome variables ( P > .05). The incidence of intolerable mucositis in the control group was 100% compared with 17.8% in the experimental group. Repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences in the onset and severity of oral mucositis ( P = .001), oral health status ( P = .001), and oral dysfunctions ( P = .001) between the experimental and control groups. CONCLUSION: Turmeric mouthwash was effective in reducing the severity of oral mucositis and associated oral dysfunctions as compared with benzydamine mouthwash. IMPLICATIONS: Use of turmeric, a nontoxic and cost-effective intervention, can be an alternative to the traditional management of oral mucositis.",

This study compared the effect of 3 commercial mouthwashes on plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and bleeding index (BI) in patients with chronic gingivitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-five patients (all with moderate plaque) were randomly allocated into 3 groups (Gp): Gp 1 (CHX), Gp 2 (Manuka), and Gp 3 (Pro-Dental). Three periodontal clinical parameters - PI, GI, and BI - were recorded at baseline and on days 7, 14, and 28. An oral hygiene maintenance program was followed by a double-blinded intervention (coded bottle containing mouthwash). Both inter-group and intra-group comparisons were made using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with multiple t tests. All probable values were considered to have various levels of significance at P<0.05 or below. RESULTS All indices for all groups showed higher values (mean) at baseline, which were lower on days 7, 14, and 28. No differences in any clinical parameter at any point of time existed between Gp 1 and Gp 2. There were, however, significant differences (P<0.05) between Gp 1/Gp 3 and Gp 2/Gp 3 for all clinical parameters at all observed time periods (days 7, 14, 28). Intra-group comparison for all groups demonstrated highly significant differences between baseline values and other time points. CONCLUSIONS For managing chronic gingivitis, Manuka mouthwash is as effective as a CHX mouthwash, as there were no differences observed in any clinical parameters at any point points.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In daily dental practice, plaque-induced gingivitis is one of the most common periodontal diseases that is frequently encountered. Accumulation of microbial biofilms on surfaces of teeth and poor or inadequate oral hygiene is the chief predisposing factor for this condition. In such a state, antimicrobial mouthwash as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control helps in maintaining good oral hygiene. Among the many conditions, fixed orthodontic treatment is one of the conditions where plaque control becomes challenging to the patient as well as the dentist. In such a situation, antimicrobial mouthwash as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control is highly recommended. Dentistry has recently evidenced a shift of approach for treating many inflammatory oral diseases by using herbal treatment modalities. Aloe vera is one such product exhibiting multiple benefits and has gained considerable importance in clinical research recently. The present study aimed to evaluate efficacy of aloe vera mouth rinse on the dental plaque and gingivitis in patients who were undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment in comparison with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 30 subjects with fixed orthodontic treatment. The subjects were grouped in the test group (15 subjects with 10 ml aloe vera mouthwash (99.6% [w/v])) and the control group (15 subjects with 0.2% 10 ml chlorhexidine mouthwash). Plaque index, gingival index and bleeding on probing were recorded for each participant at baseline, 21 days from baseline and 35 days from baseline. The findings were then statistically analysed using student paired and unpaired t-test. RESULTS: Gingival index showed a statistically significant difference from baseline to 21 days and 35 days visit in both the groups. Plaque index and bleeding on probing were statistically significant among both groups when compared baseline to 21 days and 35 days visit, but the difference was not significant between visit 2 and visit 3. CONCLUSIONS: Although chlorhexidine is still the gold standard mouthwash, aloe vera exhibits promising results in reducing plaque and gingivitis scores, without any reported adverse effects. Larger multi-centric trials are needed to prove its effectiveness on dental plaque-induced gingivitis.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 50 patients in the treatment group and 62 patients in the prevention group were included. Subsequently, each group was divided into an experimental group and a control group. In the treatment group, the experimental patients received recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11) mouthwash, whereas the control group received Kangfuxin fluid. In the prevention group, experimental patients still received rhIL-11 mouthwash based on routine oral care, whereas the control group only received routine oral care. Meanwhile, we observed and recorded the efficacy in the treatment group, and the occurrence and grades of OM in the prevention group. RESULTS: Through statistical analysis, the results showed that on the seventh day of treatment, the experimental group showed more improvement compared to the control group, and it was statistically significant (p = 0.032). The average healing time in the experimental group (3.59 ± 1.927 days) was shorter than that in the control group (4.96 ± 2.421 days; p = 0.031). In the prevention group, we observed the incidence of oral mucositis. No significant differences were found in the occurrence and grades of OM in the experimental and control groups (p = 0.175). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results indicate that rhIL-11 mouthwash may be a superior option to treat OM, especially in severe cases, compared to Kangfuxin fluid. However, there is no advantage in prevention.",

The gold standard treatment of NPC is radiotherapy (RT), as NPC is a radiosensitive tumour. Although RT is successful in treating NPC, patients cannot avoid the resulting RT complications. Oral mucositis is the most frequently encountered debilitating complication of RT and has no specific preventive treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 2.5% propolis mouthwash for preventing RT-induced mucositis in patients with NPC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a prospective, double-arm, randomised control trial with intervention. The patients were randomly divided into an experimental group receiving propolis mouthwash and a placebo group receiving normal saline mouthwash. All patients were instructed to rinse their mouths with 7mL mouthwash three times daily for six weeks. The severity of oral mucositis was then evaluated by the World Health Organization Oral Toxicity Scale at the second, fourth, and sixth weeks of the study. RESULTS: In total, 17 patients completed the study: 10 patients used the propolis mouthwash and seven used the placebo mouthwash. The mean mucositis scores for the propolis mouthwash compared to the placebo at the second, fourth, and sixth weeks were 0.10 vs. 1.14, 0.50 vs. 2.00, and 1.20 vs. 2.86, respectively, and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant (p<0.001).

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To clinically assess the effects of a mouthwash containing an extract of Sambucus williamsii var. coreana, a natural ingredient, on halitosis and halitosis-causing bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 77 participants. The experiment was conducted at Misoplant ﻿Dental Clinic ﻿in Busan, ﻿South Korea. Participants were divided into two groups: a control group consisting of 38 participants, to who whom a saline gargle was administered 1x/day for 30 s, and an experimental group consisting of 39 participants, who used a mouthwash containing Sambucus williamsii var. coreana extract 1x/day for 30 s for 1 day or 5 days. Halitosis was measured for 30 s in the absence of brushing or moisture. A sterile #15 paper point was placed in the gingival sulcus for 10 s﻿, after which it was analysed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The measurement time points were defined as follows: 'baseline': before starting the gargling routine; '1 day of treatment': immediately after gargling once on day 1; '5 days of treatment ': after gargling once a day for 5 days. Clinical results were ﻿statistically analysed using SPSS 24.0 for Windows. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, halitosis clearly decreased in the experimental groups '5 days of treatment' and '1 day of treatment' (p < 0.05). There were statistically significant differences in the levels of halitosis-causing bacteria between the two groups; bacterial concentration in the experimental group decreased statistically significantly from day 1 to day 5 day of gargling with Sambucus williamsii var. coreana extract (p < 0.05). Accordingly, we clinically verified that Sambucus williamsii var. coreana has antibacterial effects against oral bacteria. CONCLUSION: The application of Sambucus williamsii var. coreana extracts effectively reduced halitosis and halitosis-causing bacteria. Therefore, mouthwashes containing Sambucus williamsii var. coreana extract can be used as an effective substitute for chemical formulations for treating halitosis.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to verify the clinical applicability by applying a mouthwash containing Sambucus williamsii var. coreana extract for preventing periodontal disease. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 64 patients, excluding those with insufficient data, who visited M dental clinic located in Busan, Korea. Thirty-two people were assigned respectively to the saline solution gargle group and the Sambucus williamsii var. coreana extract gargle group to conduct the O'Leary index, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and subgingival plaques. For the homogeneity of the two groups, scaling was carried out one week before the experiment, and the participants were taught for oral care to conduct during the study period. SPSS 24.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used to compare the saline solution gargle group and the Sambucus williamsii var. coreana extract gargle group as well as to analyze Baseline (before gargle application), Treatment (immediately after gargle application), and After 5 Days (5 days after gargle application). There was a significant difference in the O'Leary index, PI, GI and subgingival plaques after Treatment and After 5 days (p < 0.05). Also, the periodontal-related indexes improved as the application time increased in the Sambucus williamsii var. coreana extract gargle group. The antibacterial effect was also shown for gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria in subgingival plaques as the application time increased. The use of the mouthwash containing Sambucus williamsii var. coreana extract was found to be effective for oral periodontal-related indicators and bacteria causing periodontal disease. Therefore, using a mouthwash containing Sambucus williamsii var. coreana extract, a natural drug, will possibly maintain healthy periodontal health by inhibiting and preventing the progression of periodontal disease.",

This study was to assess the levels of red complex bacteria in chronic periodontitis patients following treatment with probiotic mouthwash. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty chronic periodontitis patients with ages ranging from 18 to 55 years were recruited for the study. The control group was given placebo mouthwash and the study group was given probiotic mouthwash. After clinical monitoring and scaling and root planing, the collected plaque samples at baseline and 14th day were transferred for microbiological analysis by transport media for Conventional Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction. RESULTS: On the 14th day, all the clinical parameters were significantly reduced in the study group with gingival index (p = 0.003 HS) and plaque index (p = 0.001 VHS). In the study group, there was significant bacterial cell reduction with T. denticola (p = 0.041 S) and T. forsythia (p = 0.037 S). CONCLUSION: In patients with chronic periodontitis, treatment with probiotic mouthwash significantly reduces the levels of red complex bacteria. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of probiotic mouthwash could be a useful adjunct to scaling and root planing in chronic periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To summarise the available data on the effects of chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash in treating gingivitis during treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple electronic databases were searched up to December 7th, 2021. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2.0). After data extraction and risk of bias assessment, differences were recorded in several oral hygiene indices in time and mean percentage change in those indices using different antimicrobial solutions. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were deemed eligible for inclusion, reporting on a total of 602 patients with an age range of 11-35 years. The experimental solution was a 0.06%, 0.12%, or 0.2% CHX mouthwash with the control either a placebo mouthwash or a selection from a variety of mouthwashes. Treatment duration varied from 1 day to almost 5 months and the follow-up period varied from 1 min to 5 months. Chlorhexidine mouthrinses led to reduced plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation during orthodontic treatment, while at the same time, some of the control group mouthrinses were deemed equally effective. No statistically significant difference was detected in the meta-analysis between CHX and mouthwashes with propolis/probiotics/herbs﻿﻿ in terms of the gingival index ﻿at 3 to 4 weeks ﻿(mean difference 0.07, 95% CI: -0.18, 0.31, p = 0.59)﻿. CONCLUSION: Chlorhexidine mouthwash in orthodontic patients successfully controls gingival inflammation and bleeding when compared to untreated controls, but is equally effective as other mouthrinses﻿ where various oral health indices are concerned.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to investigate the short-term effects of chlorhexidine mouthwash (MW) on gingival health surrounding orthodontic miniscrew implants (OMIs) and their overall survivability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two participants (mean age, 22.8 years) undergoing fixed orthodontic appliance treatment after maxillary premolar extraction were randomly allocated in a parallel fashion to either receive (1) MW with an active component of chlorhexidine or (2) a placebo. Each participant received two maxillary buccal OMIs for anchorage reinforcement purposes. Participants were assessed for their gingival oral health status around all inserted OMIs and had their OMI survivability recorded at three time points; T1 = 1 month, T2 = 3 months, and T3 = 6 months after OMI placement. A Kaplan-Meier plot was used to estimate the survival function of OMIs. RESULTS: All randomized participants completed the follow-up period. In terms of gingival oral health, there were no statistically significant differences at any time point between the chlorhexidine MW group and the placebo-controlled group (P > .05). One OMI was lost in the chlorhexidine MW group and another two OMIs in the control group. There was no significant difference between both groups in terms of survivability (P = .585). CONCLUSION: The use of chlorhexidine MW does not seem to have a significant clinical impact on gingival health around OMIs or their survivability in this pilot study.",

The aim of the study is to test at two weeks the antimicrobial and antiplaque properties, subjects affected by chronic periodontitis, showed by a mouthwash containing Chlorhexidine (CHX) 0.2% with Anti Discoloration System (ADS), PVP-VA, and Sodium DNA in comparison with a placebo mouthwash. A single center randomized controlled trial was conducted on a total of fifty-four (54) subjects. In the test Group (n = 27) patients were treated by a 0.2% Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash with ADS, PVP-VA, and Sodium DNA, while a placebo mouthwash was used in the control Group (B). The full mouth plaque score (FMPS), full mouth bleeding score (FMBS), and gingival index (GI) were assessed at baseline, and at 1 and 2 weeks after treatment. FMPS score recorded at baseline (V2) was 52.7 ± 9.2 in the Group Test and 58.2 ± 6.1 in the Group Control (p > 0.05). After 1 week (V3), FMPS was 13.3 ± 5.6 in the Group Test and 18.7 ± 4.3 in the Group Control (p < 0.05), while at V4 (2 weeks), FMPS was 14.2 ± 4.1 in the Group Test and 20.3 ± 5.2 in the Group Control (p < 0.05). FMBS score recorded at baseline (V2) was 46.7 ± 8.7 in the Group Test and 49.2 ± 6.2 in the Group Control (p > 0.05). After 1 week (V3), FMBS was 12.7 ± 4.2 in the test Group Test and 18.5 ± 5.9 in the control Group Control (p < 0.05), while after 2 weeks (V4), it was 13.1 ± 3.2 in the Group Test and 19.8 ± 4.9 Group Control (p < 0.05). This trial has clinically showed the efficacy of a new formulation of chlorhexidine mouthwash in reducing bacterial plaque and gingival inflammation. A significant reduction of inflammation and bleeding scores was found in periodontal patients treated by a mouthwash containing CHX 0.2% with ADS, PVP-VA, and Sodium DNA compared to those treated with a placebo mouthwash."

      "abstract": "The airborne transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via respiratory fluids and droplets suggests that mouthwashes containing substances with virucidal activity can help reduce viral spread. We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to assess the virucidal activity of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouthwashes. Outpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without symptoms were randomized to perform washes and gargles for 1 min with 15 mL of either colored distilled water or 0.07% CPC (Vitis CPC Protect) mouthwash. The study outcomes were the SARS-CoV-2 log10 viral RNA load and the nucleocapsid protein levels, both in saliva at 1 and 3 h after the intervention. In total, 118 patients were enrolled and randomized (mean [SD], age 46 [14] y). Thirteen of 118 participants (11%) did not complete follow-up or had insufficient sample volume for testing and were excluded from the analysis. The assessment of the viral load showed no significant differences between groups at any of the investigated points. However, the levels of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein of lysed viruses were significantly higher in the CPC group compared with the control group at 1 h (adjusted difference 269.3 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 97.1-441.5) and at 3 h postintervention (561.1 pg/mL; 95% CI, 380.0-742.2). In nonhospitalized patients with asymptomatic or mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, a 0.07% CPC mouthwash, compared to placebo, was associated with a significant increase of nucleocapsid protein levels in saliva, indicating enhanced disruption of viral particles.",

This review evaluates the efficacy of chitosan mouthwash in comparison to chlorhexidine mouthwash in combating plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation. Electronic databases such as Medline, Cochrane, LILACS, TRIP, Google scholar, and clinical trial registries (CTRI) for ongoing trials were searched with appropriate medical subheadings (MeSH) and search terms. Randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy of chitosan mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash on dental plaque accumulation and gingivitis were included. The outcome variables of interest were plaque index, gingival index, gingival bleeding index, and colony-forming unit (CFU/ml). All data from the included studies were extracted in a customized extraction sheet. The risk of bias across the studies was assessed using the Cochrane tool for intervention (ROB-2), which consisted of six domains. Of the included three studies, we found one study with an overall low risk of bias and two studies with an overall high risk of bias across the domains. Though there was a significant reduction in plaque accumulation, gingival inflammation, and colony-forming units on the use of chitosan mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash separately, all three included studies reported that a combination of both be more effective."

A total of 25 adult participants used 10 mL of FLJ as mouthwash 30 s daily for 6 months in addition to their normal oral homecare routines. Standard oral examinations and gathering of samples were performed at the beginning of the study and after six months and one year. Resting and stimulated saliva secretion rates, resting saliva pH, and stimulated saliva buffering capacity were determined. A questionnaire of participants' subjective sensations of mouth dryness was also recorded at each timepoint. Fermented lingonberry juice mouthwash had positive effect to all five salivary parameters and were, according to the omnibus test, statistically significant during the study period. Analysis of the subjective dry mouth sensation questionnaires revealed that symptoms of xerostomia decreased due to the use of FLJ. This study revealed that the once-a-day use of FLJ mouthwash had a beneficial, increasing effect on salivary flow rates, buffering capacity, and salivary pH. FLJ thus can be safely used as an adjunctive and beneficial therapy in oral homecare, protecting teeth and oral mucosa, including periodontium, and also relieving dry mouth symptoms."
