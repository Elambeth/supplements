      "abstract": "Nicotine has been reported to initiate NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation in different pathological conditions. The current study assessed whether thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) mediates nicotine-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and consequent podocyte injury. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that nicotine-induced TXNIP/NLRP3 interaction in podocytes relative to control groups. However, pre-treatment with TXNIP inhibitors, verapamil (Vera) or SRI-37330 (SRI) attenuates nicotine-induced TXNIP/NLRP3 interaction. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that nicotine treatment significantly increased the colocalization of Nlrp3 with Asc, Nlrp3 with caspase-1 and Nlrp3 with TXNIP in podocytes compared to control cells. Pretreatment with TXNIP inhibitor Vera or SRI abolished nicotine-induced Nlrp3/Asc, Nlrp3/caspase-1 or Nlrp3/TXNIP colocalization. Correspondingly, nicotine treatment significantly increased the caspase-1 activity and IL-1β production compared to control cells. However, prior treatment with TXNIP inhibiting Vera or SRI significantly attenuated the nicotine-induced caspase-1 activity and IL-1β production. Further immunofluorescence analysis showed that nicotine treatment significantly decreased podocin and nephrin expression compared to control cells. However, pretreatment with TXNIP inhibiting Vera or SRI attenuated the nicotine-induced podocin and nephrin reduction. In addition, confocal, flow cytometry and biochemical analysis showed that nicotine treatment significantly increased desmin expression, apoptosis and cell permeability compared to control cells. However, prior treatment with TXNIP inhibiting Vera or SRI significantly attenuated the nicotine-induced desmin expression, apoptosis and cell permeability. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TXNIP/NLRP3 interaction constitutes a potentially key signalling mechanism driving nicotine-induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation, activation and subsequent podocyte damage."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Various models of nicotine vaccines have been evaluated. In humans, antibody levels are low and variable. In this sense, it is necessary to improve or optimize the nicotine vaccines already evaluated. We reported the efficacy of the M6-TT vaccine. Recently, we reported the efficacy of the COC-TT vaccine, which was developed from the M6-TT vaccine. Both vaccines generate high titers of antibodies and attenuate heroin- or cocaine-induced behavioral effects in rodents. Aims and Methods: The objective of this study was to determine whether the antibodies generated by a tetanus toxoid-conjugated nicotine vaccine (NIC6-TT) can produce anti-nicotine antibodies and decrease the nicotine-induced reinforcing and psychomotor effects. Male Wistar rats were immunized with the NIC6-TT. A solid-phase antibody-capture ELISA was used to monitor antibody titer responses after each booster dose in vaccinated animals. The study used nicotine self-administration and nicotine locomotor sensitization testing to evaluate the nicotine-reinforcing and psychomotor effects. Results: The NIC6-TT vaccine could generate high and sustained levels of anti-nicotine antibodies. The antibodies reduced the nicotine self-administration and expression of nicotine locomotor sensitization. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the NIC6-TT vaccine generates a robust immunogenic response capable of reducing the reinforcing and psychomotor effects of nicotine, which supports its possible future use in clinical trials for the treatment of smokers. Implications: Smoking is the second most used psychoactive substance in the world, which is associated with millions of preventable deaths. An effective treatment is required. Nicotine vaccines must generate high levels of anti-nicotine antibodies, but above all, the decay curve of the antibodies must be very slow, so that they can provide long-term protection and support long-term smoking abstinence. The NIC6-TT vaccine meets these properties."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nicotine, a widely used toxic substance, has various receptors scattered throughout the body that have shown opposite effects on inflammatory disorders. However, the effects of nicotine on heart rate variability in ulcerative colitis are unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the effect of acute nicotine injection on heart rate variability in a rat model of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Six male Wistar rat groups, containing vehicle, UC (induction of ulcerative colitis without treatment), and nicotine (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mg/kg), were assessed. First, the rats were anesthetized and the initial electrocardiogram was recorded. Twenty-four hours after the induction of ulcerative colitis with 4 % acetic acid by rectal injection, a second electrocardiogram was recorded. Finally, 15 min after nicotine injection in each group, the last electrocardiogram was recorded. Linear and nonlinear indices of heart rate variability were extracted from the recorded R-R intervals. RESULTS: A single injection of nicotine at high doses increased the standard deviation of R-R intervals, root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats, ratio of the short-term deviation to the long-term deviation of R-R intervals, and entropy of R-R intervals in ulcerative colitis animals (at least P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acute injection of nicotine at doses 1.5 and 2 mg/kg can improve R-R interval linear indices, balance the ratio of short-term deviation to long-term deviation, and modify the entropy in the induced ulcerative colitis rats. However, further research is needed for the clinical use of acute nicotine injection in ulcerative colitis."

      "abstract": "People who undergo lung cancer screening (LCS) and continue to smoke are at risk for negative clinical outcomes and lowered survival and need effective smoking cessation interventions. This pilot study tested an 8-week intervention for smoking cessation after LCS. The participants (N = 40) were randomized to the intervention group (combination nicotine replacement therapy [NRT] plus gain-framed text messaging for 8 weeks) or the control group (standard cessation counseling) after LCS. Assessments were completed at 8-week and 3-month follow-ups, including self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence. The mean age was 64.4 years old (SD = 6.2); 32.5% were Black or African American; and 55% were female. At Week 8, 14.3% (3/21) of the participants in the intervention group were abstinent versus 0% (0/19) in the control group (p > 0.05). At 3-month follow-up, 4.8% (1/21) of the participants in the intervention group were abstinent versus 0% (0/19) in the control group. Among the intervention group participants, up to 52.4% used the provided patches and up to 61.9% used the provided lozenges during the study period. This study demonstrated modest quit rates for LCS patients receiving gain-framed text messages and NRT. The results highlight the need for more effective smoking cessation interventions for this priority population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nicotine dependence is a significant public health issue linked to various psychosocial problems. However, previous research has largely examined these relationships in a unidirectional manner or at the between-person level, overlooking the potential for within-person fluctuations over time. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the bidirectional associations between nicotine dependence, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems among adults using a longitudinal approach. Additionally, we examine gender as a potential moderator of these relationships. METHODS: Using data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study (2013-2021), we analyzed four waves of data from a nationally representative sample of 9,620 adults. A Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) was employed to distinguish between-person and within-person associations while accounting for individual variability over time. A multigroup RI-CLPM was conducted to assess gender differences. RESULTS: At the between-person level, nicotine dependence was positively associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems. At the within-person level, significant bidirectional associations were observed between nicotine dependence and internalizing problems, as well as between internalizing and externalizing problems. Gender moderated these associations, with females showing stronger links between nicotine dependence and internalizing problems, while males exhibited stronger associations between nicotine dependence and externalizing behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the complex, dynamic interplay between nicotine dependence and psychosocial problems, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions that account for both within-person fluctuations and gender differences. Understanding these mechanisms can inform more effective prevention and treatment strategies targeting nicotine dependence and associated mental health challenges."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Only a few trials target high-school aged teens with vaping interventions, typically focusing on prevention rather than cessation, with content limited to vaping harms and refusal skills. Given the co-occurrence and increasing incidence of vaping and mental health issues in teens, both must be simultaneously addressed by vaping interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a Virtual Reality (VR) intervention for teens that targets both determinants of vaping (e.g., mood and stress) and vaping prevention and cessation skills. METHODS: Participants are 150 students attending one of two racially and ethnically diverse Boston-area high schools. Health classes are randomly assigned to VR or Control (assessment only). Students are eligible if not opted out by parent, provided assent, and did not have health issues that preclude participation. While Control classes (and ineligible students within them) have their regular classroom activity, VR classes are provided with Oculus Meta Quest 2 headsets and engage with the intervention during three class periods, once per week. Players solve a mystery with a vaping sub-plot and play a series of mini-games to teach emotional regulation, coping strategies, and building resilience. A mobile app connects to the VR game, providing a home-based experience to reinforce skills learned. VR and Control classes complete baseline and post-intervention surveys on the same schedule. Primary outcome measures include feasibility, satisfaction and engagement with game play, and vaping awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and intentions to avoid or quit vaping. Secondary outcomes include vaping quit attempts, 7-and 30-day point prevalence abstinence, motivation and self-efficacy to quit or avoid vaping, positive and negative affect, emotional regulation and coping, and motion sickness. RESULTS: Data collection began in April 2024 and concluded in June 2024. Data cleaning has been completed, and analyses are ongoing. Results are expected to be submitted for publication in August of 2025. CONCLUSIONS: Because VR is visual, auditory and tactile, it is ideal for practicing skills, facilitating memory, and increasing the likelihood of transfer to real world settings. The immersion of VR promotes engagement with the intervention, rather than external digital temptations. Our study is innovative due to the cluster randomized design, focus on both prevention and cessation, integration of mood management, and implementation among racially and ethnically diverse teens. Incorporation into school-based health curriculums allows for proactive reach. CLINICALTRIAL: Clinical Trials.gov: NCT06003439."

      "abstract": "Despite hypnosis showing efficacy in treating nicotine dependence, its neurobiological impacts on a smokers' brain function remain underexplored. Thirty-three smokers underwent electroencephalography (EEG) recording during pre- and post-hypnosis sessions, each 8 minutes long, alongside Tobacco Craving Questionnaire (TCQ) assessments. Four distinct EEG microstate classes (A, B, C, D) were identified. Daily cigarette consumption negatively correlated with the microstate A duration (r = -0.39, P = 0.03). Hypnosis increased the microstate A parameters while decreasing those of microstate B. Reduced microstate B parameters positively correlated with lower TCQ scores (r = 0.46, P = 0.02). Post-hypnosis, there was a decreased variability and sample entropy in low-frequency theta-band signals, indicating a shift towards more ordered theta oscillations. This shift was inversely related to the microstate D parameters and positively correlated with the microstate C occurrences. Dynamic changes in the brain microstates and theta oscillations elucidate the neurological mechanisms underlying hypnotherapy's effectiveness in treating smoking addiction. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which hypnosis influences brain function and offer potential biomarkers for the treatment of smoking addiction, thus deepening our understanding of therapeutic approaches for substance use disorders."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Electronic cigarette use (vaping) among adolescents and young adults is common. Few treatments have been tested in this population. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of varenicline for nicotine vaping cessation in youth who do not smoke tobacco regularly. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 3-group randomized clinical trial compared 12 weeks of double-blind varenicline vs placebo, each added to brief, remotely delivered behavioral counseling and compared with single-blind enhanced usual care, with monthly follow-up to 24 weeks. The trial was conducted among youth, aged 16 to 25 years, who vaped nicotine daily or near daily, did not regularly smoke tobacco, and wanted to reduce or quit vaping, in a single US state from June 2022 to May 2024. Data collection ended May 28, 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to 12 weeks of varenicline titrated to 1 mg twice daily over 7 days (standard titration), weekly counseling, and referral to text messaging vaping cessation support (This is Quitting [TIQ]) (n = 88); identical placebo, weekly counseling, and referral to TIQ (n = 87); or enhanced usual care (referral to TIQ only) (n = 86). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biochemically verified continuous vaping abstinence for the last 4 weeks of varenicline treatment vs placebo (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included bioverified continuous abstinence from weeks 9 through 24 in the varenicline and placebo groups. Additional analyses compared varenicline group and placebo group with enhanced usual care. RESULTS: Of 261 randomized participants (mean age, 21.4 years; 53% female), 254 completed the trial (97.3%). For varenicline and placebo, continuous abstinence rates were 51% vs 14% during weeks 9 through 12 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.5 [95% CI, 3.0-14.1]; P < .001) and 28% vs 7% during weeks 9 through 24 (aOR, 6.0 [95% CI, 2.1-16.9]; P < .001). Varenicline had higher continuous abstinence rates vs enhanced usual care during weeks 9 through 12 (51% vs 6%; aOR, 16.9 [95% CI, 6.2-46.3]) and during weeks 9 through 24 (28% vs 4%; aOR, 11.0 [95% CI, 3.1-38.8]). Continuous abstinence rates were not significantly different between the placebo and enhanced usual care groups. Study medication was generally well tolerated. Two varenicline participants (2%) and 1 placebo participant (1%) discontinued study medications due to adverse events. No drug-related serious adverse events occurred. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 76 (86%) in the varenicline group, 68 (79%) in the placebo group, and 68 (79%) in the enhanced usual care group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Varenicline, combined with behavioral counseling, increased vaping abstinence in youth who vape nicotine and do not regularly smoke tobacco.

Although NCNPs are less harmful than tobacco smoking, their impact on oral health remains unclear. A systematic review and network meta-analysis will be conducted to answer the research question: What are the oral signs and symptoms associated with NCNPs as both monotherapies and combination therapies compared to each other, placebo, standard care, no drug treatment, and combustible cigarette smoking? METHODS: We will search PubMed and Scopus databases, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to August 2024. This review will focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum follow-up period of 1 month, comparing any NCNPs versus placebo, standard care, no drug treatment, combustible cigarette smoking or to each other in adult smokers. Our primary outcomes will be the number of participants reporting any oral side effect, aphthous ulcers, dry mouth and mouth irritation. Studies will be excluded if they involve: non-smokers, pregnant women, individuals with mental health or neurological disorders, participants consuming alcohol or other substances. Data will be analyzed using a network meta-analysis framework, estimating odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Risk of bias will be determined using the Cochrane risk of bias tool-version 2.0 for included RCTs and the Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis tool will be employed to assess the confidence of evidence contributing to each network estimate. DISCUSSION: Our findings will provide critical insights into the oral health implications of NCNPs, informing clinical and public health decisions. Results are expected by May 2025 and will be disseminated through publications and presentations to guide tobacco harm reduction strategies. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42024565118.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine and opioid use disorders are highly comorbid in clinical populations. Ongoing nicotine administration facilitates opioid consumption in both rodents and humans. Moreover, preclinical studies support that former exposure to nicotine solely during adolescence augments opioid consumption in adulthood similarly to acute nicotine administration. This suggests that developmental nicotine exposure persistently alters the neural substrates underlying motivation in a manner that resembles the acute pharmacological actions of nicotine. The orexin system mediates motivation to consume opioids in large part through signaling at orexin-1 receptors (ORX1Rs). Both developmental nicotine exposure and acute nicotine administration profoundly alter functioning of the orexin system which may mediate the reinforcing enhancing properties of nicotine. Here, we used behavioral economic procedures to generate demand curves for consumption of the synthetic, short-acting, μ-opioid receptor agonist remifentanil (RMF) in adulthood following prior adolescent nicotine exposure (ANE) and again following reintroduction of acute nicotine administration (ANA). We found that ANE was sufficient to augment multiple indices of the motivational value of RMF in adulthood and these effects were further exacerbated by ANA given during RMF self-administration sessions. Additionally, we demonstrate that systemic antagonism of ORX1Rs with SB-334867 is more efficacious in limiting motivation for RMF in nicotine-exposed rats relative to controls and this differential efficacy was even greater in ANA conditions relative to former ANE. These findings support that nicotine-induced facilitation of orexin signaling may mechanistically contribute to augmented opioid consumption offering critical insight for treatment options for a population that is particularly vulnerable to developing opioid use disorder."

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a significant risk factor for cancer development with complex mechanisms. This study aims to investigate the impact of nicotine exposure on the regulation of stemness- and metastasis-related properties via cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 9 subunit (CHRNA9) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) and to evaluate their therapeutic potential in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of public databases and revealed that high expression of CHRNA9, IGF1R signaling molecules, and stemness genes was significantly associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in TNBC samples. Additionally, we examined two patient cohorts to determine the clinical associations between the expression levels of different genes (n = 67) and proteins (n = 42) and showed a strong positive correlation between the expression levels of CHRNA9, IGF1R signaling molecules, and stemness markers POU5F1/NANOG in tumor tissues. We carried out nicotine treatment and knockdown of CHRNA9 and IGF1R in TNBC cells to identify the effects on stemness-related properties in vitro. Furthermore, primary and secondary metastatic in vivo animal models were examined using micro-computed tomography (μCT) screening and in situ hybridization with a human Alu probe to detect tumor cells. Nicotine was found to upregulate the expression of CHRNA9, POU5F1, and IGF1R, influencing stemness- and metastasis-related properties. Knockdown of CHRNA9 expression attenuated nicotine-induced stemness-related properties in a TNBC cell model. Furthermore, knockdown of IGF1R expression significantly alleviated nicotine/CHRNA9-induced stemness features and cancer cell metastasis in cell cultures and lung metastatic mouse models. These results demonstrate that nicotine triggers IGF1R signaling, thereby enhancing stemness-related properties, cell migration, invasion, and tumor metastasis, resulting in a poorer prognosis for patients with TNBC. These findings highlight IGF1R as a promising therapeutic target for reducing stemness and metastasis in TNBC patients exposed to environmental nicotine. © 2025 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Smoking during pregnancy poses significant health risks, necessitating accurate continuous monitoring of pregnant women's smoking behaviours. Existing methods relying on self-reporting lack objectivity, while biochemical measures like exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) provide validation but suffer from low participant engagement. We developed myCOtrak to address these limitations by integrating real-time CO monitoring with self-reported smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and e-cigarette use. RESULTS: myCOtrak combines automated CO data from the Bedfont iCO monitor with daily surveys. It demonstrated high feasibility and usability in initial testing with 23 participants, with 75% continuing data submission for ≥ 14 days. Key features include seamless CO integration, cloud-based storage, and longitudinal tracking, offering a validated, scalable tool for smoking cessation research.",

      "abstract": "Some evidence suggests that anhedonia is a component of nicotine withdrawal, but additional research is needed to support this conclusion and establish its clinical relevance. Secondary analyses were conducted for a comparative effectiveness smoking cessation clinical trial of combination nicotine replacement therapy, nicotine patches, and varenicline (N = 1,084). Self-reported consummatory anhedonia was assessed at multiple time points pretarget quit day (TQD) and post-TQD, and biochemically confirmed 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence was assessed at 4, 12, and 26 weeks post-TQD. Data collection occurred from May 2012 to November 2015. Analyses were conducted using hierarchical linear modeling, logistic regression, and general linear models. Anhedonia demonstrated a prototypical inverted-U pattern from pre- to post-TQD consistent with withdrawal, which was not moderated by medication condition (ps > .83). Greater postquit anhedonia was associated with lower odds of biochemically confirmed abstinence at 4 weeks (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.94, 0.98], p < .001), 12 weeks (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = [0.94, 0.99], p = .001), and 26 weeks (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.93, 0.98], p < .001) post-TQD. These effects remained even after controlling for other withdrawal symptoms and individual characteristics. Gold standard smoking pharmacotherapies had comparable statistical effects on anhedonia's trajectory and association with abstinence during treatment. The results replicate and extend previous research supporting anhedonia as a motivationally significant symptom of nicotine withdrawal. The results suggest anhedonia not only conforms to features of a tobacco withdrawal symptom but is associated with difficulty stopping smoking.

According to epidemiological data, PD is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has emerged as a significant global health concern. This review examines the intricate pathological mechanisms and high-risk factors associated with PD, and discusses the challenges in its clinical diagnosis and treatment. We elucidate the relationship between smoking and the reduced risk of PD, highlighting the potential neuroprotective effects of nicotine present in tobacco. The interaction between nicotine and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) is analyzed in detail, emphasizing their neuroprotective capabilities and underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we analyze the structural and functional diversity of nAChRs and their roles in the pathological progression of PD. Our review aims to elucidate the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and biochemical factors in PD and to propose future research directions that may facilitate therapeutic development."

This study explores the feasibility and effects of acupressure on smoking cessation in young smokers with nicotine dependence to inform policy and decision-making. METHODS: This was a single-group study with a pre/posttest design. The participants received four weeks of auricular acupressure treatment, led by a registered acupuncturist. Smoking cravings, nicotine dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and number of cigarettes per day (CPD) were recorded before and after treatment. Changes in outcomes were analyzed at 2 weeks and 4 weeks using SPSS software version 22.0. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants to explore their experiences and attitudes toward auricular acupressure. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 20 participants completed this study. A significant reduction was observed in smoking cravings (F = 11.02, P < 0.05), nicotine dependence (F = 11.09, P < 0.05), withdrawal symptoms (F = 11.19, P < 0.05), and CPD (F = 19.03, P < 0.05) across sessions. Additionally, withdrawal symptoms decreased significantly from 2 weeks to 4 weeks (P < 0.05) of acupressure treatment. Three interrelated themes emerged from the interviews: personal and external resources, the psychological and physical effects of acupressure, and satisfaction with acupressure for smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative and qualitative data suggest that acupressure maybe effectively decrease nicotine dependence and smoking cravings. However, this was a pilot and single-arm study, and these findings must be further verified. The study supports the feasibility and safety of introducing acupressure therapy for smoking cessation in young smokers."

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for human cancers including urinary bladder carcinoma. In a previous study, nicotine was shown to enhance rat urinary bladder carcinogenesis in a two-stage carcinogenesis model. In this study, we examined the progressive effects of nicotine on bladder carcinogenesis in F344 rats treated with N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN). Nicotine, administered in drinking water for 52 weeks following 4 weeks of BBN treatment, significantly increased the incidence and multiplicity of invasive urothelial carcinoma in a dose-dependent manner. The Ki67 labeling index of bladder papillomas was significantly increased by nicotine in a dose-dependent manner. However, nicotine treatment did not affect the incidence or total number of tumors, and nicotine administration alone for 52 weeks did not result in any neoplastic lesions. These data suggest that while nicotine does not initiate carcinogenesis, it has the potential to promote invasive urinary cancers."

This study aims to evaluate oxidative stress parameters in the brain tissue of rat offspring exposed to perinatal nicotine and assess vitamin E's protective effects. METHODS: Twenty-five pregnant rats were administered 10 mg/L of nicotine and 300 mg/L of Vitamin E in drinking water starting from the first day of gestation. On gestational day 21, some offspring were euthanized to form the prenatal group. The remaining litters were born naturally, and dams received treatments via drinking water during gestation and lactation (6 weeks). After the lactation period, the pups were weaned and directly treated for an additional 9 weeks, resulting in an overall treatment duration of 15 weeks. Brain tissues were analyzed for MDA, GSH, TOS, TAS, OSI, BDNF, Caspase-3 activity, and histopathological changes. RESULTS: The nicotine-exposed pups exhibited significantly reduced crown-rump length, body mass, and brain mass compared to controls. Nicotine exposure decreased BDNF, GSH, and TAS levels and increased MDA, TOS, and OSI levels. Histopathologically, the nicotine prenatal group showed a significantly higher number of heterochromatic nuclei in brain tissue. Caspase-3 activity did not show a significant increase in nicotine groups compared to the control. Vitamin E supplementation mitigated nicotine-induced brain damage in some measured parameters. CONCLUSION: Perinatal nicotine exposure induces oxidative damage in the brain tissue of rat offspring, while vitamin E exerts a protective antioxidant effect, preventing nicotine-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, the significant reduction in BDNF levels and the increase in heterochromatic nuclei in the nicotine-exposed groups highlight the detrimental impact of nicotine on neurodevelopment, which can be effectively mitigated by vitamin E supplementation."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Several US states have implemented regulations, including e-cigarette taxes, primarily to reduce e-cigarette use among youth and young adults. Although several studies have examined e-cigarette tax regulations, studies assessing the impact of e-cigarette taxes on the transitions of tobacco/nicotine use patterns are largely absent from the extant literature. METHODS: We included 9774 participants aged 12-17 years at baseline from waves 1 to 4 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study. We estimated transition probabilities between non-current users, e-cigarette-exclusive users and other tobacco/nicotine users. The inverse probability of treatment weighting method was applied to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of e-cigarette tax policies on the transitions between tobacco/nicotine use classes among youth and young adults. RESULTS: Participants in the states with e-cigarette tax policies had lower probabilities of progressing from non-current use to the other two classes and higher probabilities of opposite transitions than those without. The e-cigarette tax policies significantly decreased the probability of remaining as e-cigarette-exclusive users (ATT=-0.15 (95% CI -0.23, -0.08)) and increased their probability of transitioning to non-current users (0.19 (95% CI 0.09, 0.29)), compared with if they had not been exposed to e-cigarette tax policies. These policies also increased the probability of remaining in non-current users (0.02 (95% CI 0.01, 0.03)) and decreased the probability of progressing to other classes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that e-cigarette tax policies may prevent and reduce exclusive e-cigarette use in youths, providing valuable insights for states that have not implemented e-cigarette taxes."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Oral nicotine pouches (ONPs) are a newer category of smokeless tobacco products containing pharmaceutical-grade nicotine but no tobacco leaf. These products have the potential to help smokers transition away from cigarettes. To assess their potential role as alternatives to cigarettes, we evaluated the abuse liability (AL) of Velo ONPs with varying nicotine content (4-12 mg per pouch), pouch size (600 mg or 400 mg) and flavor (six varieties) in comparison to high (cigarettes) and low (nicotine replacement therapy [NRT] gum) AL comparators. METHODS: Independent randomized crossover clinical studies were conducted to assess AL, including subjective effects (product liking [PL], urge to smoke, product effects, overall PL, and overall intent to use again) and nicotine pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of Velo ONPs. Participants used test products under controlled conditions, and subjective effect measures were collected using validated questionnaires. Nicotine PK parameters, including peak nicotine concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), were assessed. RESULTS: Mean PL scores for all Velo ONPs (p < 0.0042) and Velo Mini Pouches (p < 0.0031) were significantly lower than cigarettes, regardless of nicotine level, pouch size, or flavor, but similar to NRT gum. Other subjective measures for Velo ONPs were less favorable than cigarettes and comparable to or lower than NRT gum. Nicotine uptake with Velo ONPs was slower (reflected by a longer Tmax) and had lower Cmax than cigarettes but was comparable or slightly lower than NRT gum. Overall nicotine uptake increased with increasing nicotine content and was comparable to that of cigarettes for Velo ONPs with higher nicotine levels. Flavor had no effect on nicotine uptake of Velo ONPs. DISCUSSION: Velo ONPs demonstrated an AL profile lower than cigarettes and similar to NRT gum, suggesting a reduced potential for abuse compared to cigarettes. The slower nicotine uptake and lower peak nicotine levels further support their potential as a lower-risk alternative. These findings highlight the potential role of ONPs in tobacco harm reduction strategies by providing an alternative nicotine source with a lower AL than combustible cigarettes. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: The clinical studies were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT05129657, NCT05294497, and NCT05081154."

      "abstract": "Nornicotine content is very low in tobacco, accounting for less than 5% of total alkaloids. Nicotine conversion refers to the process by which nornicotine is synthesised spontaneously and in large quantities from nicotine. CYP82E4 is the only key enzyme gene involved in nicotine conversion, but it is unclear by what mechanism plants regulate the expression of this gene and thus change the phenotype of nicotine conversion. By comparing single-base resolution DNA methylomes of senescent leaves from NC-L and its high converter variant NC-H, we found two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in CYP82E4 of NC-H. The bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) assay demonstrated that the DNA methylation levels in two specific segments of CYP82E4 were 39%-52% lower for NC-H than for NC-L. Furthermore, treatment with the DNA methylase inhibitor 5-azacitidine resulted in a decrease in DNA methylation levels of CYP82E4 and the change of nicotine conversion phenotype from norconverter tobacco to high converter tobacco. Similarly, the MET1 mutation significantly reduced the DNA methylation level of CYP82E4 and transformed the nicotine conversion phenotype. These findings suggest that DNA methylation plays a crucial regulatory role in nicotine conversion, with decreased methylation levels in CYP82E4 being significant factors in nicotine conversion."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While the health hazards of smoking are well known, the harmful effects of smokeless tobacco (snus) and other nicotine products remain less familiar. This study investigates the prevalence and habits of tobacco use among Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) personnel, focusing on the use of snus and preferred withdrawal support. METHODS: An electronic questionnaire survey was conducted among FDF personnel in 2014 and 2020. The response rates were 18% in 2014 (n=2386) and 27% in 2020 (n=3373). The study examined demographic factors, smoking, snus and e-cigarette use, and preferences for withdrawal support. RESULTS: Daily smoking decreased significantly from 14% in 2014 to 6% in 2020, while daily snus use increased from 8% to 11%. E-cigarette use remained low (<1% in 2020). The highest prevalence of snus use was among military personnel working with conscripts. About a quarter of snus users (27%) used snus with a nicotine content of 11-20 mg/g and 30% used snus with a nicotine content of 21-30 mg/g. Preferred withdrawal support included nicotine replacement therapy or medication provided by the employer. A significant number of both smokers and snus users did not receive advice to quit from healthcare professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco use among FDF personnel shows a decrease in smoking but an increase in snus use. There is a need for targeted cessation support programmes, with an emphasis on professional advice and employer-provided nicotine replacement therapy. Increased involvement of healthcare professionals in advising quitting could significantly enhance cessation rates."

This study aimed to elucidate the roles of nicotine on systemic inflammatory cytokine levels and expression patterns of nicotinic receptor subtypes in the prefrontal cortex in BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J mice. This research project characterized the effect of chronic treatment with nicotine at a dose (100 mcg/ml; po) administrated orally in drinking water over a period of fourteen days in BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J mice, while C57BL/6 J mice were served as the controls. Following the nicotine treatment, the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ interleukin (IL)-1β, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were assessed in the serum; the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-17 and interferon (IFN)-γ], on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were evaluated in the blood. Moreover, the expression of α7, α4, and β2-nAChRs in the prefrontal cortex in BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J mice was examined. Biochemical analysis showed that nicotine had significantly decreased the concentration of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and GM-CSF in the serum, and reduced the expression levels of intracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17 & IFN-γ) on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood while mecamylamine reversed the effect of IL-17+ CD4+ T cells. Nicotine administration up-regulated the expressions of α7, α4, and β2 nAChRs in the prefrontal cortex in BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J mice. The current results indicate that nAChRs play a significant role, at least in part, in ASD and might serve as a crucial target for therapeutic interventions in ASD."

As a key component of tobacco smoke, nicotine is believed to play a significant role in promoting NSCLC growth and progression. EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator highly expressed in the tumor tissues of smokers. However, whether and how nicotine regulates the expression of EZH2 and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to compare the expression of EZH2 in NSCLC samples between smokers and nonsmokers. Western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR, and immunofluorescence were employed to confirm the effects of nicotine on EZH2 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, colony formation assays, 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine staining, and Transwell assays were conducted to analyze the proliferation and metastasis of A549 and H1650 cells treated with siRNA or EZH2 inhibitors. Real-time quantitative PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess the regulatory effect of nicotine on EZH2 transcript levels via c-Myc. Coimmunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays were used to assess the deubiquitination of c-Myc by OTUB1. Finally, a nude mouse model was used to evaluate the impact of combined c-Myc and EZH2 inhibitors on tumor proliferation and metastasis in vivo. EZH2 is expressed at relatively high levels in NSCLC patients, as determined by both bioinformatic and IHC analyses. Nicotine upregulates EZH2 expression and promotes the proliferation and metastatic ability of lung cancer cells. Inhibition of EZH2 with either DZNep or EPZ6438, EZH2 inhibitors, or siRNA significantly decreased the proliferative and metastatic capacity of NSCLC cells induced by nicotine treatment. Moreover, the study revealed that nicotine induces OTUB1 expression, stabilizes the c-Myc protein via deubiquitination, and enables c-Myc-mediated transcriptional activation of EZH2. Furthermore, the c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 exhibited synergistic effects with the EZH2 inhibitor DZNep in suppressing NSCLC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo.Nicotine regulates the c-Myc/EZH2 signaling pathway via OTUB1-mediated deubiquitination, thereby promoting the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells. This research reveals novel molecular mechanisms of nicotine in the development of NSCLC, providing a theoretical foundation for future therapeutic strategies."

      "abstract": "Cigarette butts (CBs) are widespread hazardous waste contaminating the environment due to the recalcitrance of the filter and the toxicity of the contaminants leached. This paper evaluated through analysis of contaminants and toxicity bioassays on Raphanus sativus seeds, the ability of four fungal strains of white rot fungi to treat cigarette butts, including 2 native strains of Trametes sp. (strains BAFC 4765 and BAFC 4767), one of Irpex lacteus (strain BAFC 4766) and one commercial strain of Pleurotus ostreatus (strain BAFC 2034). Each strain was grown in a medium of water-soaked CBs in axenic conditions at Erlenmeyer-scale during six weeks, analyzing leachate samples periodically by HPLC-MSn. Temporal evolution of nicotine as well as the transformations of tobacco alkaloids and other contaminants generated by the different fungal treatments were characterized. Nicotine was degraded significantly by the end of the treatments although variations were found among the fungal strains, proposing a degradation mechanism based on the 12 tobacco alkaloid transformation products identified. Leachates from CBs showed a total inhibition of germination on Raphanus sativus seeds whereas those obtained after 6 weeks of treatment displayed a significant decrease of phytotoxicity (7-20 % inhibition of germination) exhibiting sublethal effects. The results obtained in this work support the development of CBs fungal treatment for waste detoxification on a larger scale."

      "abstract": "Nicotine addiction is a serious global public health problem, so there is an urgent necessity to develop novel effective smoking cessation treatments with fewer adverse effects. Spontaneous behavioral sensitization induced by repeated intermittent exposure to the addictive substance represents a classical animal model of addiction research. A significant contributor to nicotine addiction is its interaction with α6β2* nAChRs located on midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which leads to an increase in dopamine (DA) release. α-Conotoxin (α-CTx) TxIB is a novel potent antagonist of the α6/α3β2β3* nAChRs, with an IC50 value of 28.4 nM developed by our group. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of α-CTx TxIB in countering nicotine-induced behavioral sensitization and moderating the impact of nicotine on dopamine accumulation in the midbrain. Our results demonstrated that repeated nicotine administration remarkably elevated the locomotor activity of mice, including the number of entries, average speed, and total distance traveled, which could be effectively attenuated by α-CTx TxIB intervention in a dose-dependent manner (1 nmol and 5 nmol TxIB per mouse). Furthermore, 5 nmol α-CTx TxIB significantly reduced the nicotine-elevated DA and norepinephrine (NE) levels in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice. 5 nmol α-CTx TxIB also markedly decreased the expression of critical proteins such as the dopamine transporter (DAT), N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR), and c-Fos in the NAc and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the nicotine-exposed mice. This research provided the first compelling evidence that α-CTx TxIB attenuated nicotine-induced locomotor sensitization and inhibited the nicotine-induced dopamine elevation in mice. These results open up new avenues for exploring the therapeutic potential of α-CTx TxIB in the treatment of nicotine addiction.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine, the principal alkaloid in tobacco, exhibits significant central nervous system activity and induces a wide array of physiological effects. In addition to its well-documented role in tobacco dependence, previous studies have suggested that nicotine also has diverse pharmacological properties. These include alleviating symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, potentially reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease, mitigating oxidative stress, as well as anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic effects. Neuroscientists frequently use an array of molecular biology techniques to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the effects of nicotine on the central nervous system. However, disease onset is invariably accompanied by metabolic dysfunction, and organisms often exhibit complex and unpredictable responses to pharmacological stimuli. As a bioactive alkaloid with potent pharmacological properties, nicotine is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and induce brain-compound changes, which serves as the basis for its effects on the central nervous system. Consequently, examining the extensive impact of nicotine exposure on endogenous metabolites and metabolic pathways in the brain is an indispensable step toward providing a more robust foundation for understanding the complex physiological effects of nicotine. In this study, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) metabolomic-analysis method was established to systematically examine the effects of repeated nicotine exposure on endogenous metabolites in mouse brains. Two chromatographic systems fitted with Acquity UPLC BEH HILIC (150 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) and BEH C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) columns were used to determine the nicotine present in samples. As a result, the established UHPLC-MS/MS method identified a total of 759 endogenous metabolites. Compared with the saline group, nicotine exposure resulted in 575 significantly different metabolites, with 434 metabolites down-regulated and 141 up-regulated. Further pathway-enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed that nicotine exposure primarily affects essential-amino-acid, lipid, nucleotide, carbohydrate, cofactor, and vitamin metabolism, as well as other amino-acid metabolic pathways in the brain. Although non-targeted metabolomics can simultaneously detect and analyze all small-molecule metabolites in an unbiased manner, accurately capturing metabolite changes in specific brain regions is challenging when dealing with complex brain-tissue systems. Targeting the aggregation of material bases and the delivery of precision treatment to certain brain regions is expected to be significant for the targeted therapy of central nervous system diseases. Airflow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI) was further used to directly visualize the nicotine-induced distributions and variations of differentially expressed metabolites in various brain regions, which revealed that nicotine exposure leads to the significant downregulation of choline, serine, aspartate, and malate levels throughout the brain. Specifically, taurine, acetylcholine, and adenosine levels were notably affected in the cortical, hippocampal, and striatal regions, respectively. Essential-amino-acid metabolism was most affected by nicotine, with lipid metabolism found to be the next-most affected pathway. These metabolic pathways predominantly affected the cortical region, whereas the striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum were affected to varying degrees. These findings provide novel experimental evidence that enhances our understanding of metabolic biomarkers associated with nicotine exposure.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Retrospective reporting of cigarette use can impact the accuracy of outcomes in tobacco treatment trials. The inclusion of objective measures of smoking, like biomarkers of nicotine and tobacco exposure, is recommended. Most trials examining biomarkers after a behavioral intervention have included predominantly White adults enrolled in cessation, versus reduction, trials. The current study examined biomarkers of nicotine and tobacco exposure within a harm reduction trial in Black adults who smoke (AWS). METHODS: Non-treatment-seeking socioeconomically disadvantaged Black AWS (N=65) were randomized to a treatment-as-usual control or enhanced care (EC) single-session intervention aimed to reduce their smoking. Biospecimens were collected at baseline and 1-month post-treatment to measure objective markers of nicotine and smoke exposure, including expired carbon monoxide, urinary metabolites of nicotine (cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine), and urinary tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL). RESULTS: Those in the EC condition self-reported a significant reduction in smoking at follow-up (p <.01), but there were no concomitant decreases across biomarkers (all ps >.05). Exploratory analyses in participants who reported at least 50% smoking reductions or reduced daily cigarette intake by at least three cigarettes at follow-up compared to baseline revealed nonsignificant changes across all biomarkers (all ps >.05). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported smoking reductions were not biochemically verified across measures. It is possible that compensatory behaviors when reducing smoking (e.g., deeper inhalations) or underreporting of smoking contributed to this discrepancy. IMPACT: Partial smoking reduction does not appear to reduce biomarkers of carcinogen exposure and may not be an effective strategy to narrow tobacco-related health disparities in Black AWS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is the world's leading preventable cause of death, with the highest burden in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Those who have mental illness are particularly vulnerable, with a smoking rate two to five times higher than that of the general population. Quitting smoking has demonstrated benefits for mental health, including reducing stress and improving the quality of life. However, the economic feasibility of introducing Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) in the psychiatric medical environment in South Africa has not yet been explored. This study aims to address this gap by assessing the impact on the budget of implementing an NRT-based smoking cessation program in a psychiatric hospital. METHODS: This retrospective and cross-sectional study followed a budget impact analysis framework. Data were retrieved between May 19 and Aug 18, 2023, from 214 patients' medical records. Using primary and secondary data, an ingredients costing approach was used to estimate direct treatment costs of NRT smoking cessation. All costs were expressed in ZAR (South African currency). The economic evaluation was conducted from the payer's perspective, and the results were reported at a 5% discount rate. A two-way 10% sensitivity analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The study showed that study participants were primarily black, male, unemployed, diagnosed with schizophrenia and smoked lightly (69.16% ±3.46). Implementing the 3-month treatment period of NRT smoking cessation program would result in an expenditure of R1 478 915.42 for 214 patients. The hospital will require an additional 0.15% (±0.0095) of the total hospital budget and 6.09% (±0.31) of the hospital pharmacy budget. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that while implementing a NRT is crucial for improving the overall health outcomes among patients with mental illnesses, substantial investment would be required. The budgetary allocation for NRT smoking cessation interventions would vary by treatment settings and program duration. Consequently, careful consideration of budget allocation and resource distribution is necessary to ensure the program's sustainability within the broader healthcare framework in South Africa.",

      "abstract": "The effects of long-term nicotine exposure on the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer have only been studied epidemiologically, leaving the molecular mechanisms unclear. Therefore, it's challenging for clinicians to devise effective treatments based on this correlation. Our investigation explores the effects of prolonged nicotine exposure on the interaction between α9-nAChR and HER2 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells, highlighting its impact on anti-HER2 drug therapy efficacy. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis to compare HER2 + tumor samples from smokers and non-smokers, finding a more vital interaction between α9-nAChR and HER2 in non-smoker's breast tumor tissues. A simulated study on the breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor mouse model (n = 6 per group) revealed that long-term nicotine exposure significantly reduced this interaction compared to controls. Due to the poorer response of low HER2 tumors to trastuzumab in clinical practice, most patients require combination chemotherapy and have a worse prognosis. Therefore, this study chose HER2-low PDX models to simulate nicotine exposure and explore treatment strategies. Mice subjected to prolonged nicotine exposure exhibited faster tumor growth and reduced trastuzumab efficacy compared to controls (*p < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that extended nicotine exposure weakens α9-nAChR and HER2 interaction, reducing the effectiveness of HER2-targeted therapy, fostering drug resistance, and underscoring the carcinogenic risks of nicotine.",

Nevertheless, the comprehensive understanding of the cultural significance and social norms associated with vaping remains incomplete.

Peer-reviewed primary research published in English from 2003 to February 2024 was identified using the databases PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Qualitative studies reporting on the perspectives, motivations, and experiences of adolescents and young adults who currently engage in nicotine and tobacco vape use were included. Thematic analysis revealed three key themes in adolescents and young adults vaping: understanding and reasons for vaping, the challenges of addiction and withdrawal, and varied responses from families and caregivers. Adolescents and young adults are often introduced to vaping by peers and siblings, drawn by the desire to fit in and the appealing flavours. Despite awareness of potential health risks, addiction makes quitting difficult, leading to intense cravings and withdrawal challenges. Families show a spectrum of responses, from ignorance to reluctant acceptance, indicating a need for better awareness and intervention strategies to address adolescent vaping. Establishing a withdrawal pathway for vaping is imperative as an intervention strategy to address the prevalence of vaping among adolescents and young adults.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We aimed to explore the role of Apelin-13 in resisting oxidation, inflammation as well as apoptosis and its underlying mechanisms of action using a model of nicotine-induced H9c2 cardiomyocyte injury. METHODS: H9c2 cardiomyocytes were randomly divided into control, nicotine, nicotine + Apelin-13, and Apelin-13 groups. Cell counting kit-8 assay was conducted to determine the cell viability. Interleukin (IL)-6, superoxide dismutase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), IL-β, catalase (CAT), IL-8, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were examined. A 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assay was conducted to measure the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. The morphology of apoptotic cardiomyocytes was observed by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Western blotting was employed to measure the protein expressions of apoptotic factors B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X (Bax). Apoptosis was quantified using Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. RESULTS: Exposure of H9c2 cardiomyocytes to 10 μM nicotine significantly reduced cell viability and increased LDH release, oxidative stress (elevated MDA and ROS levels with decreased superoxide dismutase, GSH-Px, and CAT activities), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8), and apoptotic markers (increased Bax with decreased Bcl-2 expression, along with nuclear condensation) (p<0.05). In contrast, treatment with 2 μM Apelin-13 significantly alleviated these deleterious effects, enhancing cell viability, restoring antioxidant enzyme activities, reducing oxidative and inflammatory responses, and inhibiting apoptosis (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine induction increases the oxidative stress and apoptotic capacity of H9c2 cardiomyocytes, but Apelin-13 protects H9c2 cardiomyocytes against nicotine-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress."

However, the accessibility of these drugs is limited by their financial cost. With this review we aim to demonstrate the effect of partial or full funding in terms of efficacy, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and quality of life. We conducted a literature search for articles related to the issues mentioned above: analysis of the efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for nicotine dependence and the effect of their funding. It is shown that the funding of pharmacological treatment can increase the efficacy and effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Such funding increases motivation to make a quit attempt. In addition, these strategies can increase self-efficacy, generate social influence and change attitudes toward quitting. Although the funding of pharmacological treatment benefits all smokers, there are certain populations of smokers who are more sensitive to funding strategies such as social groups with lower incomes and lower educational attainment. These funding strategies for smoking cessation interventions have been shown to improve the health and quality of life of the population, as well as the economy, while reducing tobacco use."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We aimed to characterize current tobacco and nicotine product use and tobacco cessation efforts in Swiss primary care, including the prescription of medications and recommendation of vapes to quit smoking. METHODS: Cross-sectional study from pediatricians and primary care physicians (PCPs) in the Swiss Sentinella network (practice-based network to monitor infectious diseases). PCPs collected data from 30 consecutive patients ≥12 years of age between September and December 2021. Patient data included age, gender, nicotine products use, plans to quit, and time discussing smoking cessation. PCP data were their use of medications, follow-up appointments, and vapes for quitting smoking. RESULTS: Eighty-nine of 168 PCPs participated (53 %) and collected data on 2438 patients, of whom 523 (21,5 %) used a nicotine product within seven days, of whom 88 % smoked cigarettes. Among the 106 (20 %) who planned to quit smoking, 16 (15 %) planned to use nicotine replacement therapy, nine (9 %) varenicline, six (6 %) vapes, five (5 %) bupropion, and 57 no treatment (54 %). Moreover, 236 (46 %) of 523 patients using nicotine products received one to five minutes of cessation advice, 80 (16 %) six to ten minutes, and 17 (3 %) >10 min. Half of PCPs offered follow-up and medications to ≥50 % of patients planning to quit, while 52 % never recommended vapes. CONCLUSION: The use of nicotine products remains common among primary care patients, the majority of whom smoke cigarettes. Nicotine products without tobacco remain relatively rare. After the consultation, one in five patients using nicotine products planned to quit, the majority without any aid."

      "abstract": "Tobacco use is the leading cause of death globally and in the United States. After decades of decline, driven by decreases in combusted tobacco use, nicotine product use has increased due to electronic nicotine delivery systems, also known as e-cigarettes or vapes. Preclinical models of nicotine self-administration can serve as important lodestars in the search for effective intervention and prevention tactics. Current variants of the preclinical models have substantial limitations, however. Therefore, we created the rodent electronic nicotine delivery system (RENDS), a novel low-cost nonproprietary nose-only preclinical model of nicotine aerosol self-administration. We confirmed that RENDS sequesters nicotine aerosol in the nose port by measuring fine particulate matter (PM <2.5 microns) generated by e-cigarettes. We also showed that rats robustly self-administer flavored nicotine aerosol, resulting in high blood levels of cotinine (the major nicotine metabolite) and spontaneous somatic withdrawal symptoms. Thus, we provide validation of the operation and function of the RENDS, opening the door to an open-source preclinical aerosol model of nicotine self-administration that is relatively low in cost. Four existing operant chambers can be retrofitted with the RENDS for less than $325/chamber. All RENDS diagrams and plans for custom-designed components are on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/x2pqf/?view_only=775b55435b8e428f98e6da384ef7889d).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in smoking cessation interventions, few programs have demonstrated sustained effectiveness among low-income, underserved populations. The Communities Engaged and Advocating for a Smoke-free Environment (CEASE) program was developed to address this gap and support tobacco cessation in these communities. However, it remains unclear whether self-reported outcome measures in this context are in line with more objective outcome measures. AIMS: This study aimed to validate self-reported quit rates using the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) as a gold standard outcome measure for evaluation of the effectiveness of the CEASE smoking cessation intervention compared to a self-help approach among low-income, underserved adult smokers. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was employed to evaluate this community-based intervention. Although participants were initially assigned to three groups, this report focuses on two arms that show the major difference in the efficacy of the program: (1) the self-help group (reference; Arm 1) and (2) the in-person CEASE group (Arm 2). Outcomes included successful quitting, assessed through self-reports, and changes in FTND scores. To examine the concordance between these measures, we tested whether changes in FTND scores fully explained the relationship between the intervention and self-reported quitting. Potential confounders included demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related variables. Data were analyzed using regression and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS: The majority of participants were Black Americans, followed by White individuals and those of other racial backgrounds. The CEASE intervention (Arm 2) demonstrated effectiveness in reducing nicotine dependence (measured by FTND) and increasing self-reported quit rates compared to the self-help group. Importantly, changes in FTND scores fully explained the effect of the CEASE intervention on self-reported quitting, highlighting the program's impact on addiction severity. CONCLUSION: Successful quitting measured using self-report is in line with the decline in nicotine addiction severity among low-income racial minority populations. CEASE holds promise as a scalable solution to address smoking disparities in underserved communities."

      "abstract": "The mesolimbic dopamine system is crucial for drug reinforcement and reward learning, leading to addiction. We previously demonstrated that Arvcf was associated significantly with nicotine and alcohol addiction through genome-wide association studies. However, the role and mechanisms of Arvcf in dopamine-mediated drug reward processes were largely unknown. In this study, we first showed that Arvcf mediates nicotine-induced reward behavior by using conditioned place preference (CPP) model on Arvcf-knockout (Arvcf-KO) animal model. Then, we revealed that Arvcf was mainly expressed in VTA dopaminergic neurons whose expression could be upregulated by nicotine treatment. Subsequently, our SnRNA-seq analysis revealed that Arvcf was directly involved in dopamine biosynthesis in VTA dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, we found that Arvcf-KO led to a significant reduction in both the dopamine synthesis and release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) on nicotine stimulation. Specifically, we demonstrated that inhibition of Arvcf in VTA dopaminergic neurons decreased dopamine release within VTA-NAc circuit and suppressed nicotine reward-related behavior, while overexpression of Arvcf led to the opposite results. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of Arvcf in regulating dopamine signaling and reward learning, and its enhancement of dopamine release in the VTA-NAc circuit as a novel mechanism for nicotine reward.",

      "abstract": "A minimally invasive \"continuous nicotine monitor\" (CNM) would resolve the dynamic nicotine concentration, [nicotine]t, faced by high-sensitivity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) during and after nicotine intake by individual subjects. Motivations: \"Know the potential enemy at an individual level\". Smoking or vaping produces an initial \"bolus\" of nicotine in the blood and brain, lasting ~5 min with a peak concentration of ~ 100-200 nM. The bolus largely governs reinforcement, reward, and cognitive enhancement. A prolonged declining phase of [nicotine], with a half-time of 1 to 4 h, largely suppresses withdrawal symptoms and governs the known cell biology of addiction. Next, \"Know the potential therapy\", because individual [nicotine]t records will be useful during research on the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy. Finally, \"Know the physiology\". The only three known effects on nAChRs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the relevant [nicotine]t are activation, desensitization, and chaperoning/upregulation. Therefore, additional mechanistic insights will arise from correlating [nicotine]t with readily measurable physiological data on those effects in molecular, cellular, and brain slice systems and animal models. Interstitial fluid is the appropriate compartment for a CNM. The molecular sensor technology could employ fluorescence, as shown by progress on measuring [nicotine]t with improved variants of intensity-based nicotine-sensing fluorescent reporters (iNicSnFRs). Electrochemical measurements of [nicotine]t may also be possible. Studies like Population Assessment of Tobacco Health would contextualize [nicotine]t measurements during each subject's ad libitum nicotine intake, hopefully at a cost < $100 for a 24-hour record. The collaborative research agenda culminating in a CNM must use public funding."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adolescent smoking is a significant public health concern, as early nicotine addiction leads to more severe addiction and reduced cessation success during adulthood. While nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is an effective smoking cessation tool in adults, its efficacy in adolescents is less clear. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness and safety of NRT for smoking cessation in adolescents. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed and Cochrane Library databases identified 12 studies (randomized controlled trials and observational) examining NRT in adolescents. Outcomes included smoking cessation rates, withdrawal symptom relief, smoking reduction, and adverse events. RESULTS: NRT demonstrated limited success in long-term smoking cessation among adolescents, with low cessation rates that often declined post-treatment. However, NRT was effective in reducing smoking frequency and in managing withdrawal symptoms in some cases. The safety profile was generally favourable, with mild side effects such as skin irritation, headaches, and nausea. CONCLUSION: While NRT can reduce smoking and alleviate withdrawal symptoms, its effectiveness in sustaining long-term cessation in adolescents is limited. Adherence challenges and side effects suggest a need for complementary behavioural support and further research into tailored NRT strategies for this population."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: British Columbia residents have access to a program called QuitNow that provides behavioral support and information about pharmacotherapy to nicotine and tobacco users. Web- or computer-based smoking cessation programs have been shown to yield an abstinence rate about 1.5 times higher when compared to a control. Although quantitative evidence reveals significant promise for web-based services like QuitNow, there is very little qualitative evidence available. Understanding website utilization and the experiences of end users is key to contextualizing the effectiveness of web-based cessation services and providing directions for enhancing these services. OBJECTIVE: This qualitative interview study aims to delve into users' utilization and experiences of QuitNow, which is supplemented by Google Analytics data. METHODS: We interviewed 10 QuitNow users using semistructured interviews to understand what they liked the most and the least about QuitNow. We transcribed these interviews and conducted an inductive thematic analysis using NVivo (QSR International) software to extract common themes about user experiences. We also gathered utilization metrics via Google Analytics (n=13,856 users) to understand which aspects of QuitNow were used the most and which were used the least during the study period. RESULTS: Thematic analysis yielded four major themes: (1) barriers to information access reduce opportunities to take action, (2) lack of clarity around pharmacological options is discouraging, (3) hearing from others is an important part of the journey, and (4) recognizing own agency throughout the quit process. These themes provided context and support for the Google Analytics data, which showed that end user activity, measured by indicators such as page views and average time spent on each page, was highest on pages about how to quit (10,393 page views), pharmacology information (1999 page views), and the community forum (11,560 page views). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study point to several important implications for improving the website, as well as directions for enhancing cessation support services in general.",

Though two-thirds of people who smoke report a desire to quit, less than a quarter plan to quit within the coming month. The relative risks and benefits of e-cigarettes, proposed as a novel tool to support smoking cessation, are critical to monitor as the evidence evolves. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the evidence for smoking cessation treatment, characteristics and pharmacology of e-cigarettes, support for e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, and relevant harm reduction principles. Populations at the highest risk for continued cigarette smoking (e.g. individuals with co-occurring substance use and mental health conditions) and those who are vulnerable to initiating nicotine use through access to e-cigarettes (e.g. adolescents), are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Evidence indicating that e-cigarettes are comparable to nicotine replacement therapy points to their promise as a smoking cessation and harm reduction option for individuals who decline other treatment options. Future work should evaluate the comparative efficacy of e-cigarettes for historically excluded groups and the relative effects of specific products and monitor for any long-term effects. Evidence-based clinical guidelines are also needed to inform clinical practice in this rapidly evolving area.",

This study aimed to provide up-to-date estimates of the prevalence of single and multiple non-combustible nicotine product use among adults in England in 2023 and to estimate trends between 2013 and 2023. METHODS: Data were drawn from repeated cross-sectional surveys of adults (≥18y) in England conducted between January 2013 and December 2023. Single non-combustible nicotine product use was defined as current use of one of: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches, or heated tobacco products. Multiple use was defined as current use of two or more of these products. We used logistic regression to estimate monthly time trends in the prevalence of single and multiple product use across the study period and provided descriptive data by smoking status and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: The proportion of adults using any single non-combustible nicotine product increased non-linearly from 5.4% (95%CI=5.1-5.9) in January 2013 to 14.3% (13.6-15.0) in December 2023. The prevalence of multiple non-combustible nicotine product use was 0.7% (95% CI 0.6-0.9) in January 2013 and stable until 2020 before increasing to 1.4% by December 2023 (95% CI 1.2-1.7). Most single and multiple non-combustible nicotine product users were individuals who currently (44.7% [43.1-47.6] and 70.6% [64.2-76.1], respectively) or had formerly smoked (41.2% [39.1-43.4 and 25.5% [19.4-31.5). CONCLUSION: Use of non-combustible nicotine products has increased substantially among adults in England over the past decade. While most use only one product, a growing minority (predominantly individuals who currently smoke) use multiple non-combustible nicotine products. IMPLICATIONS: Over recent years, the proportion of adults in England reporting single and multiple non-combustible nicotine product use has risen, with the prevalence of single product use almost tripling and multiple product use doubling. It will be important to continue monitoring product use patterns as the market continues to evolve rapidly. There is also a need for further research to understand how different patterns of non-combustible nicotine use may affect people's motivation to stop smoking or success in quitting."

Some detoxification genes have been proved to be involved in the adaptability to host plants in FAW, while the role of its gut microbiota on the responses of host switches, and their ability to adapt to new host plants remain poorly understood. Herein, we isolated five strains of nicotine-degrading bacteria from the gut of S. frugiperda larvae, among which Bacillus atrophaeus B1 exhibited the highest nicotine tolerance. This strain showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 2 g/L and a nicotine degradation rate of 46.36 %. We sequenced the complete genome of B. atrophaeus B1 and 15 candidate genes were identified maybe related to nicotine degradation, among which GE003027, GE002849, GE002602, GE000220 and GE002708 had significantly higher expression when exposed to nicotine. Non-targeted metabolomics revealed 98 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) under nicotine stress, which were 72 metabolites upregulated and 26 metabolites downregulated, and the pathways most affected involved xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism, energy metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. B. atrophaeus B1 may accumulate 2-ketoglutaric acid and γ-aminobutyric acid during degradation of nicotine, which is non-toxic to S. frugiperda, and participated in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Additionally, 2-ketoglutaric acid and γ-aminobutyric acid were detected both in B. atrophaeus B1 and S. frugiperda treated with nicotine. Antibiotic treatment deprived most of the gut bacteria, followed by a decrease in tolerance of S. frugiperda to nicotine, and the nicotine degradation rate was significantly increased as expected after reinfection with B. atrophaeus B1. These findings provide new insights into the bacterial metabolism of nicotine degradation and offer a theoretical basis for understanding the rapid adaptability of S. frugiperda to various host plants.",

In a 7-week monitoring program, we collected 56 water samples from 14 lakes, 9 ponds, 9 rivers, 8 canals, and 2 canalized brooks in Berlin. Nicotine was detected in all investigated surface waters. Observed concentrations ranged between 7 ng/l and 1469 ng/l (mean 73 ng/l, median 28 ng/l). Rainy weather conditions generally led to an increase in nicotine concentrations, particularly in canals where concentrations were up to 16 times higher after rain events. For water bodies receiving sewer discharge, mean nicotine concentrations were positively related to population density, while concentrations in surface waters without sewer connections were more related to the presence of public transport stops or recreational areas. Our results highlight the high spatiotemporal variability of nicotine concentrations in urban surface waters. We recommend a temporary systematic daily or event-based monitoring of nicotine concentrations to support our findings and to better understand and quantify emission sources and concentration decay phases. This would improve our still incomplete knowledge about ecological impacts arising from long-term below-lethal nicotine concentrations in urban surface waters.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to estimate differences in alcohol consumption, receipt of alcohol brief intervention, and alcohol reduction attempts by smoking status and use of non-combustible nicotine (including e-cigarettes, nicotine replacement therapy, heated tobacco products, or nicotine pouches). Data were from a representative household survey of adults in England (n = 188,878). Participants who reported former or current smoking scored approximately 1 point higher, on average, on the AUDIT-C (which measures alcohol consumption) than those who had never regularly smoked (Badj=0.97 [95%CI 0.93-1.00] and 0.92 [0.87-0.96], respectively) and had double the odds of risky drinking (AUDIT-C ≥ 5: ORadj=2.04 [1.98-2.10] and 2.03 [1.97-2.10], respectively), while differences for those who did versus did not use non-combustible nicotine use were less pronounced (AUDIT-C: Badj=0.14 [0.08-0.21]; AUDIT-C ≥ 5: ORadj=1.09 [1.04-1.13]). Among participants who engaged in risky drinking, those who smoked (vs. not) were more likely to report receiving alcohol brief interventions, and those attempting to quit smoking (vs. not) were more likely to report alcohol reduction attempts. Overall, combustible and - less so - non-combustible nicotine use is associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption and risky drinking.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nicotine withdrawal is associated with aggression on mental health wards. This study examined whether the introduction of an inhaled form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) improved acceptability and reduced observed aggression on a high dependency mental health unit (HDU), at a tertiary level metropolitan hospital. METHOD: This retrospective cohort study included tobacco smokers admitted to the HDU over two consecutive years, following a smoking ban at the hospital. Transdermal patch and gum forms of NRT were available in the first year, with an inhaled form introduced the following year. Aggression was quantified using the Brøset violence checklist. Statistical analysis included the chi-squared test of independence and student's t-test. RESULTS: Of the 89 people admitted, 85% smoked tobacco. Of these, 71% had a history of violence and 33% had been incarcerated for this. NRT use increased from 26% to 33% in the second year. Use of NRT was associated with a significant reduction in aggression across the study period, and the overall aggression was lower in the second year. CONCLUSION: Greater choice of NRT agents can lead to improved use and acceptance, associated with reduced inpatient aggression. Acceptance, dosing and administration of NRT can all be improved by assertive policy."

      "abstract": "Background: Recent studies have shown that Nlrp3 inflammasome activation is importantly involved in podocyte dysfunction induced by nicotine. The present study was designed to test whether acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) and ceramide signaling play a role in mediating nicotine-induced Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and subsequent podocyte damage. Methods and Results: Nicotine treatment significantly increased the Asm expression and ceramide production compared to control cells. However, prior treatment with amitriptyline, an Asm inhibitor significantly attenuated the nicotine-induced Asm expression and ceramide production. Confocal microscopic and biochemical analyses showed that nicotine treatment increased the colocalization of NLRP3 with Asc, Nlrp3 vs. caspase-1, IL-1β production, caspase-1 activity, and desmin expression in podocytes compared to control cells. Pretreatment with amitriptyline abolished the nicotine-induced colocalization of NLRP3 with Asc, Nlrp3 with caspase-1, IL-1β production, caspase-1 activity and desmin expression. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that nicotine treatment significantly decreased the podocin expression compared to control cells. However, prior treatment with amitriptyline attenuated the nicotine-induced podocin reduction. In addition, nicotine treatment significantly increased the cell permeability, O2 production, and apoptosis compared to control cells. However, prior treatment with amitriptyline significantly attenuated the nicotine-induced cell permeability, O2 production and apoptosis in podocytes. Conclusions: Asm is one of the important mediators of nicotine-induced inflammasome activation and podocyte injury. Asm may be a therapeutic target for the treatment or prevention of glomerulosclerosis associated with smoking."

      "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections remain a significant public health burden globally with infected individuals at high risk for cognitive decline and memory loss even on combination antiretroviral therapy. Almost half of HIV infected individuals smoke, which drives poorer health outcomes including a higher dementia rate. Microglia are the brain's immune cells that serve as a persistent HIV reservoir contributing to neuroinflammatory signaling. We examined interactions between the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 and nicotine within human microglia cells (HMC3) that endogenously express chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) shows that gp120 alters mitochondria proteins within HMC3 cells. In the presence of nicotine, gp120 increased the expression of mitochondrial prohibitin 2 (PHB2), cytochrome c (cyt c), and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) but decreased fission 1 (FIS1) levels. An analysis of mito-YFP expression confirms that interaction between nicotine and gp120 increases the size and branching of mitochondrial networks. Interaction between nicotine and gp120 is also surprisingly found to promote the release of amyloid precursor protein (APP) peptides from microglia. This was accompanied by visualization of amyloid containing vesicles that colocalized with the autophagy protein LC3B-II in the cell. Taken together, our findings show that interaction between nicotine and gp120 impact microglia in a manner that regulates mitochondrial proteins and network properties and impacts amyloid protein management and release within microglia. These mechanisms may contribute to understanding neuroinflammatory signaling in smokers with HIV.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine use during pregnancy remains a widespread problem in obstetrics, leading to complications such as intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome. Consistent education by medical personnel is essential, as no medication or supplement has been found to prevent the dangers of nicotine use during pregnancy. If a pregnant woman is unable to quit nicotine despite intensive efforts, vitamin C, with its antioxidant properties, may help mitigate these risks, as suggested by some studies. This review summarizes current knowledge based on publications related to vitamin C, nicotine, and pregnancy. Research was conducted on the medical literature platforms PubMed and Cochrane Library, using all relevant studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. The identified studies primarily examined the impact of maternal smoking and nicotine on placental function, as well as the respiratory, cardiac, neuronal, and bone systems of the offspring. They suggest that vitamin C has a generally positive preventive or protective effect, though no study has shown complete compensation for the damage caused by nicotine. Nicotine abstinence remains the most crucial preventive measure. If this is not achievable despite intensive efforts by medical personnel, vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy may be considered. With a very low side effect profile, a daily dose of up to 500 mg can be recommended. However, further studies are necessary to provide reliable data on the effectiveness and appropriate dosage, given an ethically justifiable study approach.",

      "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and nicotine exposure have been implicated in lung cancer development. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and potential biomarkers associated with this exposure in lung cancer patients. We integrated gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas lung cancer cohort and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with BaP and nicotine exposure. Enrichment analyses, survival analyses, and immune cell infiltration analyses were conducted to interpret the biological significance of these DEGs. A risk score model and a nomogram were constructed for a prognostic evaluation. We identified 163 DEGs related to BaP and nicotine exposure in lung cancer. Enrichment analysis revealed significant biological processes and pathways, including \"IL-17 signaling\", \"cellular senescence\", and \"p53 signaling\". From the DEGs, 34 prognostic genes were identified, with CLDN5, DNASE1L3, and GPR37 being independent prognostic factors. A risk score model based on these genes showed significant prognostic value, with high-risk patients exhibiting poorer survival outcomes. Additionally, a nomogram based on these risk scores demonstrated good predictive accuracy and clinical utility. Kaplan-Meier analyses confirmed that high expression of CLDN5 and GPR37 correlated with poor survival, while high DNASE1L3 expression indicated better survival. Single-gene enrichment analyses linked these genes to immune responses, cell adhesion, and DNA methylation. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed significant correlations between the expression of these genes and the infiltration of various immune cell types. Our findings highlight the significant role of CLDN5, DNASE1L3, and GPR37 in lung cancer associated with BaP and nicotine exposure. The constructed risk score model and nomogram provide valuable tools for prognostication, and the identified genes offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the influence of toxic exposure on the tumor-immune microenvironment can guide future research and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Smokers experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage have higher smoking rates and lower quit success compared to the general population. While nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are effective smoking cessation aids, their use in this population is limited. We examine perceptions of NRT and e-cigarettes among low-income smokers. METHODS: We analyzed baseline data from 167 low-income smokers interested in reducing or quitting smoking but not currently using e-cigarettes, enrolled in the French STOP trial, a randomized controlled trial evaluating a preference-based smoking cessation intervention. Baseline measures included demographics, smoking habits, mental health, and perceptions of NRT and e-cigarettes. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) identified subgroups based on perceptions, and multinomial logistic regression examined associations between subgroup membership and predictors. RESULTS: Three subgroups emerged: \"adopters\" (44 %) with positive views of both aids, \"doubters of e-cigarettes\" (35 %) who found the tools easy to use but questioned the effectiveness of e-cigarettes, and \"resistors\" (21 %) with negative perceptions of both aids. Older age, not receiving social benefits, and absence of depressive symptoms were linked to being a \"doubter of e-cigarettes\", while heavy smoking was associated with being a \"resistor\". Previous NRT use increased the probability of being a \"doubter of e-cigarettes\", whereas prior e-cigarettes use decreased the likelihood of belonging to the \"doubters of e-cigarettes\" and \"resistors\" groups. CONCLUSION: Low-income smokers hold diverse perceptions of NRT and e-cigarettes influenced by age, financial difficulties, mental health, and previous quit attempts. Tailored cessation interventions addressing these factors into account may improve quit rates in this population.",

Those planning to stop smoking within 30 days (24%), 6 months (24%) or a year or more (27%) had switch rates of 53 ~ 59% at Month-24; those who planned never to quit (6%) had 51% switch rates. Daily ENDS use was prospectively associated with the highest likelihood of subsequent switching (vs. infrequent: OR = 1.68; 95%CI = 1.60-1.77); frequent users (≥20 days/month) also had higher switch rates (OR = 1.22; 95%CI = 1.15-1.28). Descriptively, participants higher on RTSS were more likely to be daily or frequent users, but frequency of use neither interacted with RTSS, nor mediated its association with switching.Conclusions: Most ENDS adopters were not ready to stop smoking, and would not be candidates for cessation treatment. However, a majority - even of those never planning to quit - were abstinent from cigarettes two years later. ENDS may facilitate smoking abstinence in populations not reached by traditional cessation interventions."

      "abstract": "Craving is a key symptom of nicotine addiction, driving the urge to seek cigarettes. It is often strongly influenced by social and environmental cues associated with the typical use of the substance. In both clinical and laboratory setting, craving can be experimentally triggered using cue reactivity paradigms, where nicotine-related cues are presented to evoke, and then assess, the desire to smoke. In the last few years, virtual reality (VR) has begun to attract a lot of interest in recreating realistic simulations to investigate craving through cue-reactivity exposure. However, a direct comparison between VR and non-immersive devices (e.g. 2D images presented using monitor) regarding their effectiveness in triggering cravings is still missing. In this study, we investigated differences in craving responses by comparing immersive and non-immersive nicotine-related cue-reactivity paradigms. A group of smokers (N = 23, F = 15, Mage = 23.2y.o.) and non-smokers (N = 22, F = 13, Mage = 23.7y.o.) participated in two sessions of cue reactivity exposure, featuring neutral and smoking-related scenarios presented through VR (immersive) and 2D display images (non-immersive). Each session included recording of physiological activity (skin conductance level), self-reported cigarette craving, and an assessment of the overall quality of the experience. Results showed that smokers experienced increase in cigarette cravings after exposure to nicotine-related cues compared to neutral scenarios. Moreover, self-report craving was higher after the VR cue reactivity compared to the 2D modality. A positive relationship between scores in the nicotine dependence questionnaire and self-report craving during VR cue-reactivity session was found, but not for the non-immersive session. Regarding physiological responses, smokers exhibited significantly higher skin conductance levels compared to non-smokers during the VR cue reactivity session. In contrast, no significant differences between the two groups were observed during the 2D display exposures. Participants evaluated the VR paradigm as more realistic tool to recreate credible simulations of real-life situations, and a positive correlation between self-reported craving and vividness of experience was found in the smokers' cohort. The present study provides further elements supporting the use of VR in the cue-reactivity paradigm for craving assessment, compared to non-immersive devices. Future studies will aim to confirm the effectiveness of VR as a better tool in assessing craving during clinical treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nicotine can lead to renal damage in hypertension patients. Negative air ions (NAIs) is a natural antioxidant. However, rare research focus on the effect of NAIs on nicotine aggravated oxidative damage and hypertensive kidney damage. METHODS: We used a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model to investigate the molecular mechanisms for nicotine-exacerbated renal damage and the intervention effect of NAIs. 8-week-old male rats were injected with nicotine or nicotine+ 6 h/d 4.5 × 104 to 5 × 104 NAIs/cm3 for 1 month or 3 months, and continuous observation of systolic blood pressure (SBP). Urine and blood were collected for test kidney injury, inflammation and oxidative stress levels, and renal tissues were harvested for pathology analysis and further molecular assays using RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Our results showed that nicotine exacerbated SBP and renal damage, and elevated serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in SHR. After 3 months of 1.5 mg/kg nicotine exposure, serum levels of urea nitrogen (BUN) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in SHR increased by 1.3 times and 16.3 times, respectively. In addition, oxidative damage was significantly increased along with the activation of TGF-β/Smad pathway and promotion of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), key factors reflected in the higher expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX2), α-SMA and N-cadherin proteins and increased mRNA levels of fibronectin-1 (FN1) and Twist. After NAIs intervention, levels of BUN, urinary creatinine ratio, TGF-β1, endothelin 1 (ET-1) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were decreased close to SHR without nicotine exposure, and we also observed oxidative damage was significantly decreased and TGF-β/Smad pathway and EMT related factors were significantly down-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: NAIs can attenuated nicotine-exacerbated hypertensive renal damage and fibrosis process through inhibiting oxidative stress and TGF-β/Smad pathway. We suggest that NAIs intervention could be proposed a new approach to adjuvant therapy of chronic kidney disease in smokers with hypertension.",

Participants were categorized based on NRT usage at 1 month: non-users (n = 255), users of < 1 week (n = 112), and 1-week users (n = 178). The primary outcome was self-reported 7-day point prevalence of abstinence (PPA) at 6 months. RESULTS: Compared with non-users receiving counseling alone, 1-week users had higher 7-day PPA at 3- (aRR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.24 to 2.20) and 6-month (aRR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.29 to 2.25), higher 60-day (aRR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.33) and 150-day continuous abstinence (aRR 2.06, 95% CI: 1.33 to 3.20), and higher smoking reduction rates at 3- (aRR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.27 to 2.17) and 6-month (aRR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.02) follow-ups. Users of < 1 week had similar smoking abstinence and reduction rates compared with non-users (all p > .05). Higher 7-day PPA at 6 months of 1-week users was observed in lower versus higher education and income (both p for interaction < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence presented suggests the real-world effectiveness of 1-week NRT sampling combined with counseling for increasing smoking abstinence and reduction rates in women. This implies that encouraging sampling of NRT will improve smoking cessation outcomes, particularly for women of low socioeconomic status. IMPLICATIONS: We found that using 1-week NRT sampling combined with counseling was associated with higher smoking abstinence and reduction rates compared with counseling alone in women receiving a quitline service. We also found that women with socioeconomic disadvantages and older age benefited more from the use of 1-week NRT sampling. These findings highlight the importance of offering and promoting the use of 1-week NRT sampling as part of smoking cessation programs for women, particularly those with lower socioeconomic status, potentially to narrow cessation disparities."

Our pilot investigated the spatial variability of biomarkers indicating exposure to nicotine and endocrine disrupting chemicals in municipal wastewater, taking into account important covariates, i.e. physicochemical wastewater parameters and sewershed characteristics. We also tested normalization by an endogenous population marker. Twenty-four-hour composite samples (n = 24) were collected in a volume-proportional manner using automated samplers from four wastewater treatment plants in Essen, Germany, over three weeks in late 2023. Substances of public health concern, previously already quantified in wastewater and expected to be present in high concentrations, were analyzed using SPE-LC-HRMS. Concentrations were normalized to the reported population (de jure) and the daily mass load of the catecholamine metabolite vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) as a proxy for the de facto population. Spatial variations were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Nicotine metabolites (cotinine, hydroxycotinine) and the industrial chemical Bisphenol A (BPA) were quantifiable in all wastewater samples. The population-normalized daily mass load of nicotine metabolites (median range: 0.6-1.6 g/d/1000 inh) and BPA (2.5-4.0 g/d/1000 inh) varied between the WWTPs, but the observed variation disappeared when adjusting for wastewater temperature (nicotine) and wastewater pH (BPA). Normalization to the VMA daily mass load resulted in different spatial patterns and increased the variance considerably. Our findings highlight the importance of adjusting for physicochemical characteristics when analyzing community-wide differences in exposure to toxicants and lifestyle factors via wastewater, to ensure accurate interpretations of the underlying drivers of these differences.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Approximately 85% of individuals receiving opioid agonist therapy for opioid dependence smoke tobacco. Despite the significant health risks associated with smoking-related diseases, there has been limited evaluation of smoking interventions tailored to this population. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of an intervention combining nicotine replacement with brief behavioral support in reducing cigarette use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter randomized clinical trial was conducted from April 2022 to October 2023 in 7 specialized opioid agonist therapy clinics in Bergen and Stavanger, Norway. The analyst was blinded to patient groupings. Assessors (study nurses) were not fully blinded to participant allocation. Individuals diagnosed with opioid dependency receiving opioid agonist therapy at participating clinics and smoking at least 1 cigarette per day were eligible for participation. Data analysis was performed from December 2023 through October 2024. INTERVENTION: In addition to standard opioid agonist therapy, participants in the intervention group received a 16-week integrated treatment combining nicotine replacement with brief behavioral support. Participants in the control group received only standard opioid agonist therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was at least a 50% reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, self-reported as cigarette use in the past 7 days at week 16. The analysis followed intention-to-treat principles. Cigarette use was self-reported as per the timeline-follow-back method. RESULTS: Among the 259 participants (mean [SD] age, 48.5 [10.4] years; 80 [30.9%] female), 135 were allocated to the intervention group and 124 to the control group. The odds ratio of at least halving the number of cigarettes smoked was 2.07 (95% CI, 1.14-3.75) in the intervention group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Providing integrated nicotine replacement and behavioral support at opioid agonist treatment clinics effectively helped opioid-dependent participants reduce the number of cigarettes smoked.

      "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) has long been considered a major factor in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Ethanol (EtOH) and nicotine (Nic), either alone or in combination, have been shown to affect nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal activity. Here, we investigate whether EtOH and Nic alone or in co-exposure can restore the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced depletion of dopamine (DA), DA metabolites, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum and hippocampus of C57BL/6N mice. MPTP-treated mice were treated intraperitoneally with saline (control), EtOH (1.0-3.0 g/kg), Nic (0.5-2.0 mg/kg), or a combination of EtOH and Nic. Brain samples were collected 1 h after treatment. DA and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), and homovanillic acid (HVA) were measured by HPLC-ECD, while TH protein content and TH phosphorylation at Ser31 (pSer31 TH) were quantified by Western blot. EtOH (2.0 and 3.0 g/kg) alone reversed the effects of MPTP treatment in both studied brain regions, as evidenced by an increase in DA, DOPAC, and HVA contents, TH protein, and pSer31 TH compared to the MPTP group, indicating restorative effects on DA neurons in the MPTP model. Likewise, Nic (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) alone reversed MPTP treatment effects, with treated mice showing increased DA, DOPAC, and HVA contents, TH protein, and pSer31 TH compared to MPTP mice. Co-administration of EtOH (2.0 g/kg) and Nic (1.0 mg/kg) further increased DA, DOPAC and HVA tissue contents, TH protein, and pSer31 TH, indicating an additive effect. These results show that moderate to high doses of EtOH and Nic induce similar increases in brain DA and TH via TH phosphorylation activation in MPTP model mice. EtOH and Nic showed an additive effect in combination, suggesting that their co-application could be a potent therapeutic strategy for treating PD.",

METHODS: This study investigated the impact of chronic nicotine administration on cognitive function and molecular pathways in Presenilin 1/2 double knockout (DKO) mice, an amyloid-β: (Aβ:)- independent model of AD. Three-month-old and eight-month-old DKO and wild-type (WT) mice received oral nicotine treatment (100 μg/ml) for three months. Behavioral assessments revealed that while the 6-month-old cohort showed no significant differences between nicotine-treated and control groups regardless of genotype, nicotine improved contextual fear memory in 11-month- old DKO mice but impaired nest-building ability and cued fear memory in age-matched WT controls. Transcriptome analysis of the prefrontal cortex identified distinct molecular responses to nicotine between genotypes. RESULTS: In DKO mice, nicotine modulated neuropeptide signaling and reduced astrocyte activation, while in WT mice, it disrupted cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and neuroactive ligand- receptor interaction pathways. Western blot analysis revealed that nicotine treatment significantly reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) expression in 11-month-old DKO mice, which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing decreased astrocyte activation in multiple brain regions CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that nicotine's effects on cognition and molecular pathways are both age- and genotype-dependent, suggesting its therapeutic potential may be limited to specific stages of neurodegeneration while potentially having adverse effects in healthy aging brains."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study aims to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of auricular acupuncture-related therapies (AARTs) in managing nicotine dependence (ND). METHODS: We searched eight databases from their inception through December 2024 and screened randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating AART for ND. The primary outcome was the ND cessation rate. We assessed study quality using the ROB-2 tool and applied the GRADE approach to determine the certainty or quality of of evidence. RESULTS: Nine RCTs involving 1032 patients were analyzed. Meta-analysis results indicate that AART significantly reduces the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale score (MNWS) in ND patients compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (mean difference, MD=1.47; 95% CI: 0.06-2.88, p<0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in ND point cessation rate, Fagerström test for nicotine dependence score (FTND), Hamilton Anxiety Scale score (HAMA), daily smoking volume, or exhaled CO levels between AART and NRT. Notably, AART was associated with a lower incidence of adverse events compared to NRT (relative risk, RR=0.15; 95% CI: 0.04-0.56, p<0.01). There were also no significant differences in the ND point cessation rate between auricular-plaster therapy (APT), body acupuncture (BA), and the combination of APT and BA. CONCLUSIONS: AART is effective in improving ND, showing greater efficacy in reducing MNWS and enhanced safety compared to NRT. Given the limited number of studies, the optimal AART regimen remains undetermined. Further research is needed to confirm and refine these findings."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence has shown that low-dose nicotine could have preventive and therapeutic effects on ischemic stroke (IS). Nevertheless, direct evidence is still missing, especially key molecules and signal pathways. METHODS: Mice were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the sham group, the control group, and the nicotine-treated group. In the control group, mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R). In the nicotine-treated group, mice were exposed to 12 μg/ml nicotine in their drinking water for 1 month prior to undergoing surgery. For in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model, hCMEC/D3 monolayers were prepared on Transwells and pre-treated with nicotine for 48 hours and then subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Moreover, RNA-seq was adopted to explore the potential targets and signaling pathways regarding the protective role of nicotine. RESULTS: MCAO/R resulted in significantly compromised BBB integrity and serious brain damage. Notably, pretreatment of mice with 12μg/ml nicotine for one month significantly reduced IS-induced BBB damage and its associated brain injury. In addition, the permeability of hCMEC/D3 monolayer endothelial cells was significantly reduced under OGD/R conditions, which could be ameliorated by nicotine pretreatment. The RNA-seq results showed that TGF-β and Wnt signaling pathways were associated with pathways associated with DEGs between OGD/R and OGD/R plus nicotine treatment. Finally, the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathways could be antagonized by the α7 nicotine acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) inhibitor α-BTX. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that nicotine treatment could alleviates the IS-compromised integrity of BBB by regulating the Wnt signal pathway through α7 nAChR. IMPLICATIONS: The study demonstrates that nicotine at low concentrations exerts neuro-protective effects by supporting the integrity of BBB and subsequent endothelial viability after ischemic stroke. This finding suggests that targeting the BBB, especially endothelial cells, with nicotine treatment is a promising therapeutic strategy for brain injury after ischemic stroke."

Three days after the surgical procedure, the animals continued to receive nicotine until the day of euthanasia, totalling 21 days after extraction. RESULTS: The result was that the groups that received coadjuvant therapy had neoformed mature bone, unlike the group that did not receive it. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the literature and the results obtained, we can conclude that nicotine negatively influenced the healing process and bone repair in the alveoli; however, the use of ozonised water and LPLT, even in the presence of nicotine, was effective, as it enhanced the repair process, making them good options for surgical procedures in patients who smoke.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Traditional Miao and Dai Chinese medicines have used nicotine-rich leaf tobacco to treat traumatic injuries by promoting hemostasis. While nicotine is known to enhance platelet aggregation, its effects on other platelet functions and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study aimed to thoroughly investigate nicotine's effects on human platelets and its pharmacological mechanisms, using thromboelastography to assess nicotine's impact on platelet function during coagulation. This study aimed to investigate the functional effects of nicotine on human platelets and elucidate its pharmacological mechanisms. The impact of nicotine on platelet function during the coagulation process was assessed using thromboelastography. Further studies showed that nicotine fully activates washed platelets, promoting aggregation, granule release, adhesion, spreading, and plaque retraction. Concurrently, nicotine was found to enhance the intracellular concentration of calcium ions in platelets ([Ca2+]i). To explore the underlying mechanisms, molecular docking software was employed to identify the platelet membrane receptors PAR1 and PAR4, which exhibited the highest docking scores with nicotine. Intervention with two receptor inhibitors demonstrated that only the PAR4 inhibitor could reverse the stimulatory effects of nicotine on platelet granule release. Through the examination of alterations in the downstream signaling pathways of PAR4 receptors, it was determined that nicotine promo-facilitates the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and ERK1/2 proteins, subsequently contributing to the activation of αIIbβ3 receptors in platelets. Conversely, the application of PAR4 inhibitors was found to reverse these effects. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, nicotine activates αIIbβ3 receptors and significantly enhances platelet function by promoting the phosphorylation of the platelet PAR4 receptor signaling pathway. These findings suggest the potential utility of nicotine as a hemostatic agent."

Combination nicotine replacement therapy (cNRT), a long-acting controller plus short-acting reliever, is the most effective way to prescribe nicotine but is infrequently prescribed by primary care physicians (PCPs). We tested the feasibility and effectiveness of a brief, educational intervention to increase cNRT prescribing by PCPs in a large integrated health system. METHODS: We conducted a pre-post study from 2022-2023 at a large integrated health system in California where specific NRT products are covered with a prescription. PCPs were offered a 30-minute virtual training about cNRT during a required monthly meeting (n = 267; 202 attended). The training was interactive, included simple \"asks\" and a 6-week follow-up communication. Chi-square analysis was used to test for changes in cNRT prescribing behaviors in the 6 months before and after training. RESULTS: Among physicians who completed a posttraining questionnaire (180/202), 93% reported increased confidence, 91% reported favorable attitudes, and 88% reported intention to prescribe cNRT. According to data obtained from the integrated pharmacy database, the total number of patients who received a cNRT prescription increased from the 6-month pre- to 6-month postintervention from 135 (9%) to 380 (23%), P < 0.001. The total number of physicians who prescribed cNRT increased pre- to posttraining from 78 (23%) to 124 (37%), P < 0.001. CONCLUSION: cNRT is an underutilized form of tobacco cessation therapy by PCPs. This may reflect a gap in prescriber knowledge.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of death and disease, including those related to the cardiovascular system. Cytisine is a plant-based medication, which works in a similar mechanism to varenicline. It is safe, efficacious, and cost-effective for smoking cessation. While there are effective therapies such as nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, varenicline, and cytisine for smoking cessation, relapse remains common. It is unclear how best to support these individuals. This study aims to assess the feasibility of randomizing patients who relapse to combination NRT or cytisine after admission to a cardiac hospital. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, two-group parallel feasibility trial. METHODS: This trial will recruit relapsed smokers from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive cytisine or combination NRT, alongside counseling and follow-up support. Feasibility outcomes include recruitment rates and treatment completion. Secondary outcomes include smoking cessation rates and adverse events. A total of 60 participants will be recruited using stratified randomization by sex to ensure gender balance. Data will be analyzed descriptively, focusing on feasibility and efficacy measures to inform future trials. DISCUSSION: The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting patients who were recently admitted to the hospital and have relapsed to smoking within 180 days post-discharge. This will inform future studies aimed at recruiting patients who have relapsed to understand how best to support them to quit smoking. This study will also compare the acceptability, efficacy, and safety of cytisine compared to combination NRT, as demonstrated in previous studies in other populations. Notably, cytisine's shorter regimen and natural composition broaden its appeal, potentially supporting a wider spectrum of people who smoke. The study's robust design, infrastructure, and expertise enhance its feasibility. Future research avenues, especially among cardiac patients and relapsed individuals, promise further insights, potentially transforming cessation strategies worldwide.

A total of 250 valid responses were received and were available for analysis. Using the statistical package SPSS Version 23 the statistical analysis was done. The survey results was disseminated in accordance with the CHERRIES criteria for sharing E-survey results. RESULTS: There was a response rate of 78.12 %. 69% of the subjects were offering tobacco cessation counseling while only 20.4% were actually practicing NRT. 52% believed that NRT along with counseling increases the rate of successful quitting the habit. 98% believed that they lacked formal training to introduce NRT for patients. CONCLUSION: Though study subjects had a positive attitude towards tobacco cessation and Nicotine Replacement Therapy, it does not reflect their current practice. Dental practitioners must get ongoing education in order to enhance their skills in prescription NRT, as a major obstacle to providing NRT is a lack of formal training.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rural regions generally report higher smoking rates than urban centers, which increases the risk of tobacco related harms and consequences, and makes promoting smoking cessation in these areas a priority. Mass distribution of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) by postal mail has been found to increase the odds of successful cessation attempts. Understanding factors that contribute to the use of NRT could help maximize this intervention's effectiveness. METHODS: People who smoke cigarettes and live in rural areas of Canada were recruited from December 2020 to February 2022 using random digit telephone dialing. Participants were either randomized to be mailed a free, 5-week supply of NRT patches (experimental condition; n=252) or not (control condition; n=246). This secondary analysis used data from this randomized controlled trial to conduct an ordinal regression to determine if any variables measured at baseline predicted which participants in the experimental condition used none, some, or all of the NRT patches. RESULTS: Greater confidence in ability to quit (AOR=1.07; 95% CI: 1.00-1.15) independently predicted more patch use, while living in more remote places (AOR=0.25; 95% CI: 0.07-0.90) and past substance use (compared to having no history) (AOR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.45-1.04) independently predicted less use. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding what contributes to NRT use in rural mass distribution programs could help maximize the odds of successful cessation attempts, personalize treatment recommendations, and target limited rural resources. Future research focused on rural NRT use and smoking cessation is merited."

      "abstract": "Cinnamomum, a genus within the Lauraceae family, has gained global recognition due to its wide-ranging utility. Extensive research has been dedicated to exploring its phytochemical composition and pharmacological effects. Notably, the uniqueness of Cinnamomum lies in its terpenoid content, characterized by distinctive structures and significant biological implications. An intriguing discovery is that sesquiterpene compounds originating from Cinnamomum possess the capacity to function as antagonists for human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically the nAChRÿ3 subtype, rendering them potential candidates for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to aid active smokers. This investigation employed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to assess the inhibitory effects of these compounds on nAChRÿ3. Among the 55 compounds examined, Dihydroxyeudesmene, Gibberodione, and Germacrene-E exhibited the highest binding affinities. These compounds demonstrated robust interactions with the nAChRÿ3 receptor, as evidenced by elevated molecular mechanics general surface area (MM/GBSA) values (ΔG Bind = Dihydroxyeudesmene: -36.45 kcal/mol, Gibberodione: -36.51 kcal/mol, and Germacrene-E: -36.51 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed the stability of these three compounds, indicating their potential to effectively compete with native ligands. However, comprehensive in vitro, in vivo, and clinical investigations are imperative to ascertain the efficacy of these promising therapeutic candidates."

Ghrelin and its receptor have been involved in reward sensation and addiction induced by natural and artificial drugs, including nicotine. The present study aimed to investigate the impacts of ghrelin and GHRP-6 on the horizontal and vertical activity in rats exposed to chronic nicotine treatment followed by acute nicotine withdrawal. Methods: Male and female Wistar rats were exposed daily to intraperitoneal (ip) injection with 2 mg/kg nicotine or saline solution for 7 days, twice a day (at 8:00 and at 20:00). In parallel, the rats were exposed daily to an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection with 1 μg/2 μL ghrelin or 1 μg/2 μL GHRP-6 or saline solution for 7 days, once a day (at 8:00). On the morning of the eighth day (12 h after the last ip administration) and the ninth day (24 h after the last ip administration), the horizontal and vertical activity were monitored in a conducta system. Results: On the eighth day, in nicotine-treated rats a significant hyperactivity was observed, that was reduced significantly by ghrelin and GHRP-6. On the ninth day, in nicotine-treated rats a significant hypoactivity was assessed that was reversed significantly by ghrelin and GHRP-6. Conclusions: Based on the present results, the changes in horizontal and vertical activity observed after 12 and 24 h of nicotine withdrawal can be attenuated by ghrelin and GHRP-6."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perinatal nicotine exposure (PNE) induces pulmonary dysplasia in offspring and it increases the risk of respiratory diseases both in offspring and across generations. The maternal gut microbiota and its metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), can regulate fetal lung development and are susceptible to nicotine exposure. Therefore, modulation of PNE-induced changes in maternal gut microbiota and SCFAs may prevent the occurrence of pulmonary dysplasia in offspring. OBJECTIVE: Our previous studies demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) ameliorated PNE-induced impairment in offspring lung development. To further our study, we aimed to determine whether the protective effect of EA is associated with the modulation of changes in maternal gut microbiota and SCFAs. METHODS: We observed changes in maternal gut microbiota and serum SCFA levels in both mother and offspring after EA treatment using a PNE rat model. Furthermore, using broad-spectrum antibiotics, we established a pseudo-germ-free PNE rat model to explore whether EA can protect offspring's pulmonary function and lung morphology in the presence of depleted maternal gut microbiota. RESULTS: Our study revealed that EA increased the community richness (Sobs index) of perinatal nicotine-exposed maternal gut microbiota and the abundance of beneficial bacteria (RF39, Clostridia, Oscillospirales, etc.). This was accompanied by an upregulated serum levels of acetate, butyrate, and total SCFAs in both mother and offspring rats, as well as stimulated expression of SCFA receptors (GPR41 and GPR43) in the lung tissue of offspring rats. However, the beneficial effects of EA on offspring pulmonary function (FVC, PEF, PIF, and Cdyn) and lung morphology (alveolar number and MLI) were lost after maternal gut microbiota depletion. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that EA may exert its therapeutic effects on PNE-induced lung phenotype by altering maternal gut microbiota. The likely mechanism involves the associated improvement in serum SCFA levels in both mother and offspring, as well as the upregulation of SCFA receptors in the lung tissue of offspring."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for renal dysfunction. Smoking associated with renal damage bears distinct physiological correlations in conditions such as diabetic nephropathy and obesity-induced glomerulopathy. However, the cellular and molecular basis of such an association remains poorly understood. High mobility group box 1(HMGB1) is a highly conserved non-histone chromatin associated protein that largely contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as sepsis, atherosclerosis, and chronic kidney diseases. Hence, the present study tested whether HMGB1 contributes to nicotine-induced podocyte injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biochemical analysis showed that nicotine treatment significantly increased the HMGB1 expression and release compared to vehicle treated podocytes. However, prior treatment with glycyrrhizin (Gly), a HMGB1 binder, abolished the nicotine-induced HMGB1 expression and release in podocytes. Furthermore, immunofluorescent analysis showed that nicotine treatment significantly decreased the expression of podocyte functional proteins- podocin and nephrin as compared to control cells. However, prior treatment with Gly attenuated the nicotine-induced nephrin and podocin reduction. In addition, nicotine treatment significantly increased desmin expression and cell permeability compared to vehicle treated podocytes. However, prior treatment with Gly attenuated the nicotine-induced desmin expression and cell permeability. Mechanistic elucidation revealed that nicotine treatment augmented the expression of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) and pre-treatment with Gly abolished nicotine induced TLR4 upregulation. Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 with Resatorvid, a TLR4 specific inhibitor, also attenuated nicotine induced podocyte damage. CONCLUSION: HMGB1 is one of the important mediators of nicotine-induced podocyte injury through TLR4 activation."

This study examined the use of adjuvant treatment options in the area of smoking cessation such as aromatherapy.The sample for our anonymous online survey (Sosci survey) consisted of 351 experts. All of them had registered with their contact data in a freely accessible database (https://www.anbieter-raucherberatung.de/anbieter.php). A total of 88 experts took part in the survey. Respondents were on average 53 years old, and 71% were female. They reported on average 14 years of experience in smoking cessation counseling. More than half of the participants (66.3%; n=57) had employed at least one adjuvant treatment option. Exercise (49.1%), hypnosis (34.5%) and acupuncture (27.3%) were mentioned most often.Adjuvant treatment options appear to be important in the counseling of tobacco and nicotine users and there should be more discussion on these options among experts. These should also considered in the development of curricula for counsellors on tobacco and nicotine cessation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low temperatures disrupt nitrogen metabolism in tobacco, resulting in lower nicotine content in the leaves. 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) is a widely used plant growth regulator known for its roles in enhancing cold tolerance and nitrogen metabolism. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether EBR enhances leaf nicotine content under low temperature conditions during the mature stage of flue-cured tobacco. RESULTS: To investigate the effects of EBR on leaf nicotine content under low temperature conditions during the mature stage of 'Yunyan 87' flue-cured tobacco, four treatments (foliar spraying of 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg·L- 1 EBR solutions) were performed by using a single-factor randomized complete block design. The result showed that foliar spraying of different concentrations of EBR notably improve the agronomic and economic traits of flue-cured tobacco to varying degrees, as well as increase the total nitrogen and nicotine content in the tobacco leaves. 0.2 mg·L- 1 EBR treatment showed better results, with nicotine content in the middle and upper leaves after curing increasing by 11.11% and 19.90%, respectively, compared to CK. Compared to the single EBR, foliar spraying of EBR compound containing α-Cyclodextrin and Tween 80 prolongs the effect of EBR, promotes the growth and development of tobacco plants. Combining EBR with CaCl2 and ZnSO4·7H2O significantly enhances the cold resistance of tobacco plants. Furthermore, combining EBR with higher concentrations of KH2PO4 is more effective in promoting the maturation and yellowing of the upper leaves than those with lower concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights that foliar application of EBR enhances leaf nicotine content under low temperature conditions during the mature stage of flue-cured tobacco by regulating cold stress tolerance. The integration of EBR with α-Cyclodextrin, Tween 80, CaCl2, ZnSO4·7H2O and KH2PO4 showcases a novel approach to extending the effectiveness of plant growth regulators and improving agricultural sustainability. Furthermore, these findings may be applicable to other cold-sensitive crops, offering broader benefits for improving resilience and productivity under low temperatures. However, the research focuses on two growth cycles, without investigating the long-term impact of EBR on soil health, crop sustainability, and ecosystem. And further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of EBR on enhancing leaf nicotine content. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

To elucidate the action mechanism of nicotine on feeding and body weight, especially the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, we reviewed the studies on nicotine's effects on feeding and body weight by the regulation of various nerve systems, energy expenditure, peripheral hormones, gut microbiota, etc. The role of neuronal signaling molecules such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and kappa opioid receptor (κOR) were specialized in the nicotine-regulating energy expenditure. The energy homeostasis-related neurons, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), prolactin-releasing hormone (Prlh), etc, were discussed about the responsibility for nicotine's effects on feeding. Nicotine's actions on hypothalamus and its related neural circuits were described in view of peripheral nervous system, reward system, adipose browning, hormone secretion, and gut-brain axis. Elucidation of neurobiological mechanism of nicotine's actions on feeding and body weight will be of immense value to the therapeutic strategies of smoking, and advance the medicine research for the therapy of obesity.",

We conducted a prospective cohort study of 404 MMS patients. Variables analyzed included patient age, sex, post-operative complications, and nicotine history via a questionnaire. We found that patients with any history of nicotine use had an 8.5% absolute risk of experiencing complications while the risk for patients without a history of nicotine use was 3.1%, representing a relative risk of 2.75. Cox proportional hazard testing found patient sex and past smoked tobacco use as statistically significant factors for complications. Patients who have smoked tobacco appear to be at a significantly increased risk of experiencing a complication following MMS compared to never-nicotine users.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many tobacco smokers try to quit with electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS or e-cigarettes). We aimed to describe e-liquid flavors and nicotine concentration use over 6 months in a prospective cohort of smokers willing to quit with ENDS. METHODS: We included 622 participants from the intervention group of the Efficacy, Safety and Toxicology of ENDS randomized controlled trial. Participants were adult smokers smoking at least five cigarettes a day. They received free ENDS and a choice of 6 e-liquid flavors in 4 nicotine concentrations and smoking cessation counseling. We tracked flavor choice and nicotine concentration at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and at 6 months, after the target quit date, comparing participants who reported only vaping (exclusive e-cigarette users) to those who vaped and smoked (dual users) over the last 7 days. We applied multivariable regression models to compute adjusted risk ratios (ARR). RESULTS: At Week 1, 66% (n=409) were exclusive e-cigarette users, and 21% (n=129) were dual users. At Month 6, 43% (n=266) were exclusive e-cigarette users, and 16% (n=102) were dual users. While flavor choices were similar at Week 1, at 6 months, exclusive e-cigarette users reported using more fruity flavors than dual users (31% vs 22%, ARR=2.10; 95% CI: 1.21-3.66). The nicotine concentration used initially was similar in both groups and diminished over time. At 6 months, exclusive e-cigarette users used a lower mean nicotine concentration than dual users (6.3 vs 8.2 mg/mL, difference= -1.55; 95% CI: -2.84 - -0.25 mg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: After 6 months, exclusive e-cigarette users used more fruity-flavored e-liquids and chose a lower mean nicotine concentration than dual users."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of nicotine on the behavioral phenotypes and pathological characteristics of mice induced by human alpha-synuclein preformed fibers (α-syn-PFF). Mice were injected with 5 µg of human α-syn-PFF in the hippocampus while administering nicotine-containing drinking water (200 µg/mL). After 1 month, the motor ability, mood, spatial learning, and memory ability of the PD phenotype-like model mice were detected using open field, rotarod, Y maze, and O maze tests. The expression of pathological α-syn and apoptotic proteins, as well as the number of glial and neural stem cells in the hippocampus of mice, was detected using western blot and immunofluorescence. The results demonstrated that nicotine significantly reduced pathological α-syn accumulation, α-syn serine 129 phosphorylation, and apoptosis induced by α-syn-PFF injection in the hippocampus of mice. Nicotine also inhibited the increase in the number of glia, microglia, and neuronal apoptotic cells, and it decreased the expression of PI3K and Akt while also exhibiting significant memory impairment, motor deficits, and anxiety-like behavior. In conclusion, our findings suggest that nicotine ameliorates behavioral deficits and pathological changes in mice by inhibiting human α-syn-PFF-induced neuroinflammation and apoptosis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The public health impact of new nicotine products will depend on their use by different population groups. We assessed the prevalence of nicotine pouch use among youth and adults in Great Britain (GB). AIMS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional annual Action on Smoking and Health Smokefree GB Adult Surveys 2020-2024 (n: 12 247 to 13 266, 18+) and Action on Smoking and Health Smokefree GB Youth Survey 2024 (n = 2872 11-18-year-olds). Weighted proportions and 95% confidence intervals for pouch ever and current use among adults over time, and in 2024 among youth and adults overall, by socio-demographics, mental health, tobacco smoking, vaping, past-12-month gambling, cannabis, and alcohol use; for youth also family members' smoking and vaping. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the association with ever pouch use. RESULTS: The prevalence of adult ever and current use doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching 5.4% (95% confidence interval = 5.0 to 5.8) and 1.0% (0.8-1.1). Among youth, 3.3% (2.7-4.0) reported ever use, including 1.2% (0.8-1.6) reporting current use. Ever use was associated with the use of other addictive products. Among adults, ever use was also more common among younger groups (18-24, 25-34, 35-44 vs. 55+), males, and those in rented accommodation or receiving mental health treatment. Among youth, ever use was also more common among those in London than elsewhere in England. CONCLUSIONS: Pouch use in GB is rare with about 1 in 100 youth and adults reporting current use. However, use appears to be increasing and is higher in some groups, including younger adults, males and people with experience of vaping, smoking, and use of other addictive products. IMPLICATIONS: While currently low, close monitoring of pouch use is indicated. It is currently concentrated among those with experience of nicotine use. However, given the higher levels of use among young adults and teenagers, consideration of regulation may be required to minimize uptake among groups that would otherwise not have used nicotine-containing products."

      "abstract": "The Australian Government has enacted laws restricting the supply of electronic cigarettes (vapes) to people requiring them for smoking cessation or the treatment of nicotine dependence, under the care of a medical practitioner, nurse practitioner or pharmacist. Currently no vapes are included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, meaning that the prescription and supply of therapeutic vapes must be through the Special Access Scheme or Authorised Prescriber pathways. Clinical guidelines state that therapeutic vapes may be considered for supporting people who have been unable to quit smoking using first-line therapies (a combination of behavioural support and registered nicotine replacement therapies or oral smoking cessation medicines). Clinical review should occur 1 week after vape initiation, with additional follow-up according to an individualised management plan, to monitor progress, review adverse effects (e.g. cough, irritated throat, headache or nausea), encourage the use of behavioural smoking cessation supports, and discourage dual use of vapes and conventional cigarettes. An attempt to wean or stop vaping after 12 weeks is recommended, with a possible transition to registered smoking cessation medicines if required (in addition to ongoing behavioural support). The maximum recommended duration of vape use is 12 months."

      "abstract": "Tobacco use is the leading cause of death globally and in the U.S. After decades of decline, driven by decreases in combusted tobacco use, nicotine product use has increased due to Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems, also known as e-cigarettes or vapes. Preclinical models of nicotine self-administration can serve as important lodestars in the search for effective intervention and prevention tactics. Current variants of the task have substantial limitations, however. Therefore, we created the Rodent Electronic Nicotine Delivery System, a novel low-cost non-proprietary nose-only preclinical model of nicotine aerosol self-administration. We confirmed that RENDS sequesters nicotine aerosol in the nose port by measuring fine particulate matter (PM < 2.5 microns) generated by e-cigarettes. We also showed that rats robustly self-administer flavored nicotine aerosol, resulting in high blood levels of cotinine (the major nicotine metabolite) and spontaneous somatic withdrawal symptoms. Thus, we provide strong validation of the operation and function of the RENDS, opening the door to an open-source preclinical aerosol model of nicotine self-administration that is relatively low cost. Four existing operant chambers can be retrofitted with the RENDS for less than $325/chamber. All RENDS diagrams and plans for custom designed components are on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/x2pqf/?view_only=775b55435b8e428f98e6da384ef7889d)."

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that nicotine and caffeine significantly alter biological processes related to synaptic function, and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes in the nicotine-treated group were significantly more enriched in pathways related to substance dependence, with arecoline showing the least enrichment. Furthermore, only acute caffeine treatment significantly increased mouse activity, and only nicotine induced CPP.

      "abstract": "Recent data on methods used by adults to stop smoking can inform tobacco control policies. Nationally representative Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data from the 2022 National Health Interview Survey (N = 27,651) were used to analyze populations of US adults who self-reported having stopped smoking cigarettes for 6 months or longer in the last year and the methods they used, or who did not stop smoking but tried in the last year (N = 1735). In 2022, an estimated 2.9 million [95% CI 2.5 million-3.2 million] US adults had stopped smoking in the past year. Most were male, non-Hispanic White, aged < 55 years, college-educated, identified as straight, were not depressed, and currently drank alcohol. The most popular methods used to stop smoking were nicotine products (53.9% [47.4-60.3%]; 1.5 [1.3-1.8] million adults), especially e-cigarettes in combination with other methods (40.8% [34.4-47.5%]; 1.2 [0.9-1.4] million) and e-cigarettes alone (26.0% [20.4-32.3%]; 0.7 [0.6-0.9] million). Prescription drug products (8.1% [5.3-11.8%]; 0.2 [0.1-0.3] million) and non-nicotine, non-prescription drug methods (6.3% (3.9-9.7%); 0.2 [0.1-0.3] million) were less popular. A further 13.1 [12.2-14.0] million tried but did not stop smoking. Compared to those who tried but didn't stop smoking, those who successfully stopped were more likely to be younger, degree-educated, and to use e-cigarettes to stop smoking. Many adults still attempt to stop smoking unaided. Interventions to reduce smoking could focus on populations that stopped smoking the least and encourage use of evidence-based methods.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the metabolic disruptions caused by nicotine (NIC) exposure, with a particular focus on amino acid and lipid metabolism, and evaluates resveratrol (RSV) as a potential protective agent. Mice were divided into four groups: control (CON), NIC-exposed, NIC + RSV-treated, and RSV-only. NIC exposure resulted in significant weight loss, elevated glucose levels, altered lipid profiles, and organ damage, particularly in the liver and kidneys. Increased inflammation was evidenced by elevated levels of IL-6 and CRP. In contrast, RSV treatment mitigated these effects by improving lipid profiles, glycemic indices, and reducing inflammatory markers. Histopathological analysis confirmed reduced tissue damage in the NIC + RSV group compared to the NIC-alone group. Metabolomics analysis using LC-MS/MS revealed significant dysregulation in lipid, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism in NIC-exposed mice. Fold-change analysis identified altered metabolites, including sphingomyelin 36:1;02 (p < 0.001), valine (p < 0.001), triacylglycerol 4:0-18:1 (p < 0.001), and ceramide 32:1;02 (p < 0.001). Amino acids such as arginine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, and lysine, as well as NIC metabolites like nornicotine and cotinine, were identified, underscoring molecular fragmentation analysis findings. RSV treatment partially restored metabolic balance, highlighting its role as a metabolic modulator. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of RSV in alleviating NIC-induced metabolic dysfunctions by restoring lipid homeostasis and reducing inflammation. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of RSV in addressing NIC-related metabolic impairments and the need for noninvasive biomarkers for early disease detection.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco use disorder is a chronic disorder that affects more than one billion people worldwide and causes the death of millions each year. The rewarding properties of nicotine are critical for the initiation of smoking. Previous research has shown that the activation of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) plays a role in nicotine self-administration in rats. However, the role of GRs in the acute rewarding effects of nicotine are unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of the GR antagonist mifepristone and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine on the reward-enhancing effects of nicotine using the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure in adult male and female rats. The rats were prepared with ICSS electrodes in the medial forebrain bundle and then trained on the ICSS procedure. Nicotine lowered the brain reward thresholds and decreased response latencies similarly in male and female rats. These findings suggest that nicotine enhances the rewarding effects of ICSS and has stimulant properties. Treatment with the GR antagonist mifepristone did not affect the reward-enhancing effects of nicotine but increased response latencies, suggesting a sedative effect. Mecamylamine prevented the nicotine-induced decrease in brain reward thresholds and response latencies, but did not affect the brain reward thresholds or response latencies of the control rats. These findings suggest that the rewarding effects of nicotine are mediated via the activation of nAChRs, and that the activation of GRs does not contribute to the acute rewarding effects of nicotine. These studies enhance our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying tobacco use disorder.",

      "abstract": "Transthyretin is a thyroid hormone binding protein with a major role in the distribution of thyroid hormones to peripheral tissues. In preeclampsia, the failing placenta releases soluble endoglin into the maternal circulation causing systemic vascular dysfunction. Our group has previously shown that transthyretin binds to soluble endoglin and is taken up as a complex into hepatocytes. The risk of developing preeclampsia is greatly reduced by smoking cigarettes. The addictive component of cigarette smoke, nicotine, increases transthyretin expression in rodent brain and also stabilises binding between thyroxine and transthyretin. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of nicotine on transthyretin expression, secretion and uptake by hepatocytes and if nicotine altered the uptake of transthyretin bound soluble endoglin. Nicotine treatment increased transthyretin mRNA and protein levels in cultured hepatocytes. Using live cell imaging, Alexa-transthyretin uptake was significantly increased in the presence of nicotine. Alexa-soluble endoglin uptake was also significantly increased by exposure to nicotine. The transthyretin-Alexa-soluble endoglin complex was taken up via the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1). LRP1 protein levels were unaffected in nicotine treated hepatocytes. Nicotine exposure increases hepatocyte synthesis, secretion and uptake of transthyretin as well as cell uptake of soluble endoglin. Nicotine may protect against preeclampsia by increasing serum TTR which can bind soluble endoglin and remove it from the circulation. Further research is required to better understand the role of transthyretin and nicotine in mitigating preeclampsia.",

Nicotine replacement therapy has been recommended to minimize these complications. We hypothesized that a high dose (21 mg/24 h) transdermal nicotine (TDN) patch would reduce postoperative pain and opioid requirements. METHODS: One hundred abstinent tobacco smokers undergoing single-level spinal fusion were randomized into placebo (n=50) and nicotine treatment (n=50) groups. Placebo and TDN patches were applied 24 hours before surgery until 48 hours after surgery. Primary outcomes were postoperative pain scores and opioid (morphine) consumption, and serum nicotine levels. The relationship between daily tobacco use and pain and opioid requirements, and between serum nicotine levels and morphine consumption, were assessed. RESULTS: Postoperative pain scores at rest and on movement were lower in the nicotine group than in the placebo group at 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours after surgery (P<0.05). Postoperative morphine consumption was lower in the nicotine group than in the placebo group (9.92 ± 4.0 vs. 15.9 ± 5.0 mg, respectively; P=0.0002). There was a positive correlation between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and postoperative pain scores at rest (r = 0.4553; P = 0.0001) and during movement and a negative correlation between serum nicotine concentration and postoperative morphine consumption (r =-0.3664; P = 0.0089). CONCLUSIONS: TDN patches (21 mg/24 h) reduced postoperative pain and opioid requirements in abstinent tobacco smokes undergoing spinal fusion."

We completed a randomized controlled trial of individual intensive counseling and/or varenicline treatment for PWH in the Baltimore area who smoke cigarettes, and we measured serum 3' hydroxycotinine and cotinine at baseline and calculated the ratio of these two values, i.e., the NMR, for each participant.

The NMR was calculated for 155 PWH who were currently using tobacco cigarettes. The mean age was 52.9 years, 62.3% male, 91.0% Black, and they smoked a mean of 10.6 cigarettes/day. The mean NMR was 0.43, similar to that reported from other PWH cohorts. We did not find any significant correlation between NMR and cigarettes/day, nicotine dependence, temptation to smoke, or nicotine withdrawal symptoms. We did not find that lower NMR was predictive of successful cessation, nor was it associated with varenicline intolerance in those who received varenicline. Prevention Relevance: People with HIV suffer disproportionately from lung, head and neck, and other tobacco-related cancers as a consequence of high smoking rates. There is an urgent need to mitigate this harm, and the use of the NMR to personalize tobacco treatment is an area of active interest.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive disease associated with remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature. Excessive proliferation and migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) play important roles in nicotine-induced vascular injury. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is involved in intracellular communication and regulation of the pulmonary vasculature. However, the role of Cx43 and the potential mechanisms in PASMCs proliferation and migration induced by nicotine remains not very clear. In this study, we used both in vitro and in vivo models to explore the crucial role of Cx43 in pulmonary artery remodeling in nicotine treatment Tagln-Cre; Cx43+/+ and Cx43 heterozygous (Tagln-Cre; Cx43flox/+) or Cx43 Homozygous (Tagln-Cre; Cx43flox/flox) deletion mice, and further explore the mechanism. We found that nicotine exposure led to modifications in the morphology and ultrastructure of pulmonary arteries in Tagln-Cre; Cx43+/+ mice. Nicotine increased the Cx43 expression of pulmonary arteries and promoted the proliferation and migration of PASMCs of Tagln-Cre; Cx43+/+ mice in a concentration-dependent manner by promoting ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Compared with the Tagln-Cre; Cx43+/+ mice, the Tagln-Cre; Cx43flox/+ mice were protected against increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by nicotine. These results demonstrated that the downregulation of Cx43 reduced nicotine-induced proliferation and migration of distal PASMCs by inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaping is touted as a safer alternative to traditional cigarette smoking, but the full spectrum of harm reduction versus comparable risk remains unresolved. Elevated bioavailability of nicotine in vape aerosol together with known risks of nicotine exposure may result in previously uncharacterized cardiovascular consequences of vaping. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of nicotine exposure via vape aerosol inhalation upon myocardial response to infarction injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Flavored vape juice containing nicotine (5 mg/mL) or vehicle alone (0 mg) was delivered using identical 4-week treatment protocols. Mice were subjected to acute myocardial infarction injury and evaluated for outcomes of cardiac structure and function. Findings reveal that nicotine exposure leads to worse outcomes with respect to contractile performance regardless of sex. Nonmyocyte interstitial cell accumulation following infarction significantly increased with exposure to vape aerosol alone, but a comparable increase was not present when nicotine was included. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial function after infarction is significantly decreased after exposure to nicotine vape aerosol irrespective of sex. Comparable loss of contractile function was not observed in mice exposed to vape aerosol alone, highlighting the essential role of nicotine in loss of contractile function. Increased vimentin immunoreactivity was observed in the vape alone group compared with control and vape nicotine. The correlation between vaping, interstitial cell responses, and cardiac remodeling leading to impaired contractility warrants further investigation. Public health experts seeking to reduce vaping-related health risks should consider messaging that highlights the increased cardiovascular risk especially with nicotine-containing aerosols.",

      "abstract": "The α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), an ionophore, has been suggested to signal through metabotropic pathways and interact with other receptor families, such as dopamine receptors. In this study, the interaction between α4β2 nAChR and dopamine receptors was investigated through in vivo and in vitro studies. Nicotine exposure in adolescent rats is known to induce a sustained increase in nicotine's rewarding effects which was assessed by conditioned place preference (CPP) assay. The expression levels of α4β2 nAChR and dopamine D2/D3 receptors (D2R, D3R) increased after nicotine treatment. To determine which of these two dopamine receptors was increased by nicotine treatment, a newly developed ligand with high selectivity for D3R was used in the radioligand binding assay. Although the expression of both α4β2 nAChR and D3R was enhanced by nicotine exposure during adolescence, only the elevated level of D3R persisted into adulthood. In experiments conducted on mice, D3R knockout mice showed significantly lower CPP scores in adulthood compared to wild-type mice. Cellular studies showed that an increase in D3R expression was attributed to enhanced D3R promoter activity, regulated by a signaling cascade composed of Src, Syk, PKC, and NF-κB. These results demonstrate that the metabotropic signaling pathway is involved in the interaction between α4β2 nAChR and D3R, and also suggest how nicotine reward initiated in adolescence could relapse after a long abstinence period. Given the significance of adolescent nicotine exposure on nicotine addiction, this study is thought to offer a novel mechanistic perspective for understanding nicotine reward and relapse.",

DESIGN: We conducted an open-label, individually randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Using a two-armed approach, PWH who smoke were randomized to receive either intensive antismoking behavioral counselling or intensive antismoking behavioral counseling plus c-NRT (nicotine patches augmented by nicotine gum). Self-reported smoking abstinence was biochemically validated with exhaled breath carbon monoxide (CO) and urine cotinine at 6 months. Recruitment, provision of trial interventions, and follow-up of participants took place in March 2014 through June 2016. RESULTS: We randomly assigned 280 participants to the behavioral counseling arm and 281 participants to the behavioral counseling + c-NRT arm. Four hundred and thirty-eight (78%) participants were men and 123 (22%) were women. For our primary outcome of biochemically verified abstinence at 6 months, 41 (15%) were quit in the behavioral counseling + c-NRT arm vs. 28 (10%) in the behavioral counseling arm, resulting in a 5% [95% confidence interval (CI) -1 to 10%] absolute difference in relative risk and an adjusted odd ratio of 1.47 (95% CI 0.86-2.52) comparing the behavioral counseling + c-NRT to the behavioral counseling arm. CONCLUSION: Although our results did not reach statistical significance, we found augmentation of behavioral counseling with c-NRT to increase smoking abstinence at 6 months, which is consistent with performance in the general population. PWH in low-resource settings may benefit from the addition of c-NRT to existing tobacco cessation interventions.",

However, their regenerative capacity can be influenced by various factors, including cigarette smoke and electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) aerosols. Smoking and vaping can impair their regenerative potential, and even though ENDS are perceived as safer tobacco products, there is a lack of evidence to guarantee this assumption. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Changes in the viability and proliferation of PDL-MSCs will be investigated after smoke and aerosol generation and cell exposure. In addition, the effects of smoke and aerosols on the immunomodulatory capacity of PDL-MSCs co-cultured with T lymphocytes will be further determined via the evaluation of cytokine profiles and flow cytometry analysis of T-cell phenotypes. RESULTS: Combustible cigarettes (CCs) induced more severe impairment in the viability and proliferation of PDL-MSCs compared with ENDS. Also, CCs promoted a proinflammatory immune response that could cause tissue damage to progress. On the other hand, ENDS had the potential to generate an immunosuppressive response that would prevent further cell decay. DISCUSSION: The regenerative capacity of PDL-MSCs decreased after treatment with both cigarette smoke and ENDS-aerosols. Even though the results demonstrate less severe effects with ENDS, further research is essential to evaluate their safety and impact on the capacity of PDL-MSCs to prevent and restore oral injuries caused by chronic exposure to aerosols."

Recent reports indicate that ONPs in general do not contain (or only at minimal levels) the harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) identified in cigarette smoke, suggesting their potential as alternative products for reducing harm from cigarette smoking. METHODS: We assessed in vitro toxicological effects of eight ONPs, designated as modern oral (MO) 1 to 8 along with an ONP, an oral tobacco (snus), and a combustible cigarette market comparator using established regulatory toxicological assays including Ames, in vitro micronucleus (ivMN), and neutral red uptake (NRU) assays. RESULTS: The MO test products 1-7 ZYN wintergreen, and General Snus white mint were negative for mutagenicity (Ames assay), genotoxicity (ivMN), and cytotoxicity (NRU). The combustible cigarette was positive in all three assays. The MO-8 test product was negative for mutagenicity; however, it was positive in the ivMN and NRU assays at concentrations either 42 to 135-fold based on the ivMN i to iv treatment schedule or 60-fold higher, respectively, when compared to combustible cigarettes. DISCUSSION: Thus, the MO test products are likely to be less harmful than combustible cigarettes and are alternatives to cigarettes. However, understanding of long-term effects of ONPs in general requires additional research."

METHODS: In order to test memory fucntion, Morris water maze and passive avoidance methods were applied in male Wistar rats undergone adolescent Nic-Eth withdrawal and the effect of crocin treatment was assessed at both behavioral and biochemical levels. The biochemical parameters included the inflammatory cytokines, indicators of oxidative stress and cholinergic metabolism within the hippocampla tissues. Animals were divided into 7 experimental groups as follows: 1) control (saline + saline), 2) nicotine + ethanol, 3-5) nicotine + ethanol + crocin (three doses), 6) nicotine + ethanol + bupropion + naloxone and 7) saline + crocin. RESULTS: Results indicated that crocin treatment effectively prevented the Nic-Eth withdrawal induced behavioral manifestations of memory impairment when assessed by Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. In addition, the biochemical alterations (in inflammatory, oxidative and cholinergic parameters) induced by Nic-Eth withdrawal were also ameliorated in rats treated by crocin. Interestingly, the mentioned ameliorative effect of crocin was found to be dose-dependent in most experiments and almost equipotential to that of bupropion and naloxone co-administration, when administered at high doses. CONCLUSION: We would like to suggest the crocin treatment as an alternative medication for the management of Nic - Eth withdrawal, however, further studies are required to assess the unknown side effects and high dose tolerability of the drug in human subjects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of the leading smoking cessation medications among individuals with current versus past major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind trial over 12 weeks with varenicline or bupropion, followed by a 12-week assessment, in participants ages 18-75 with past (N=2,174) or current (N=451) MDD or without psychiatric disorders (N=4,028). Interventions included 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy with placebo, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; nicotine patch), bupropion, or varenicline, and brief counseling. The primary safety outcome was occurrence of one or more moderate to severe neuropsychiatric adverse events. Efficacy was assessed as biochemically verified continuous abstinence during weeks 9-12. RESULTS: Among all 6,653 participants, the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events did not differ by medication within the past-MDD, current-MDD, or nonpsychiatric cohorts. The MDD cohorts had higher risk difference (p<0.001) for neuropsychiatric adverse events compared with the nonpsychiatric cohort (past-MDD cohort, risk difference=-0.03, 95% CI=-0.05, -0.02; current-MDD cohort, risk difference=-0.02, 95% CI=-0.05, 0.00). Within the past-MDD cohort, the odds ratios compared with placebo were 3.0 (95% CI=2.0, 4.5) for varenicline, 2.1 (95% CI=1.6, 2.7) for bupropion, and 2.1 (95% CI=1.4, 3.2) for NRT. Within the current-MDD cohort, varenicline differed from placebo (odds ratio=2.67, 95% CI=1.2, 6.15) and NRT (odds ratio=2.93, 95% CI=1.2, 7.2). CONCLUSIONS: All medications were generally safe in both MDD cohorts. NRT and bupropion were not more effective than placebo for those with current MDD. Varenicline plus counseling may be the best treatment for individuals with past or current MDD, given its greater efficacy, similar risk of adverse events, and, for those with current depression, reductions in anxiety and depression while trying to quit smoking.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vaping has increased among young adults (YAs), and nicotine dependence prevalence has increased among YAs who vape (YAV), in the U.S. Research on nicotine dependence symptoms (NDS) among YAV remains limited, and accurately measuring NDS and their severity remains a challenge. To date, no research has considered day-to-day NDS, as previous research focuses on retrospective measures. METHODS: Daily data came from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Vaping Supplement; out of 1,244 YAs, we analyzed data from 150 (Mage=19 (SE=0.44); 71.2% non-Hispanic white; 57.8% male) who vaped nicotine at least once during 14 daily surveys (n=882 nicotine vaping days). The vaping-specific Hooked on Nicotine Checklist measured NDS on nicotine vaping days. Dichotomous and count measures of NDS were used at the day and aggregated to the person level. Descriptive analyses and multilevel regression models were estimated. Weights ensured generalizability and adjusted for attrition. RESULTS: Any NDS were reported on 64.5% of nicotine vaping days (average 1.93 symptoms); 43.3% of nicotine vaping days had more than 1 NDS. Results across persons (rather than days) showed any NDS on 53.8% of nicotine vaping days, and 45.4% YAs reported between 1 and 2 symptoms per vaping day; 23.3% reported 2+ symptoms on average. Multilevel models showed nontrivial variance across days and persons in NDS, and regular vaping at baseline predicted NDS. CONCLUSIONS: Vaping-specific NDS varied across days and persons for any NDS and NDS severity. Future research should consider daily NDS fluctuations, identifying factors that confer risk to inform NDS prevention and treatment among YAV. IMPLICATIONS: NDS and its severity varied across days and persons, demonstrating the utility of daily data. The results were generally similar for experiencing any NDS and for NDS severity, but there was slightly more variability across days for any NDS. Intervention and treatment strategies could utilize approaches that identify and address daily symptoms to help curb nicotine dependence. Future research and treatment efforts should also consider the immediate contexts and potential factors that explain particularly elevated NDS on a given day."

      "abstract": "Incidences of seizure after e-cigarette use in adolescents and young adults have been reported, raising the concern about the risk of nicotine overconsumption. Few previous studies have investigated the effects of nicotine at high doses on brain and behavior in adolescent animals. In this study, the effects of a 15-day repeated nicotine treatment at a daily dose of 2 mg/kg body weight were investigated in adolescent and adult male rats. Nicotine treatment abolished body weight gain in the adults, but did not affect the body weight significantly in the adolescents. Only the nicotine-treated adolescents showed significant changes in brain anatomy 1 day post-treatment, which manifested as a significant reduction of whole-brain gray matter (GM) volume, a further reduction of regional GM volume in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and altered GM volume covariations between the mPFC and a number of brain regions. The mPFC of nicotine-treated adolescent rats did not exhibit evident signs of neuronal degeneration and reactive astrocytosis, but showed a significantly decreased expression of presynaptic marker synaptophysin (SYN), along with a significantly increased oxidative stress and a significantly elevated expressions of microglial marker ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1). Together, these results suggested that repeated nicotine overdosing may shift regional redox, modulate microglia-mediated pruning, and give rise to structural/connectivity deficits in the mPFC of adolescent male rats.",
