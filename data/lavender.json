      "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the potential of local anesthetics (LA) as adjuvants in cancer treatment, specifically by increasing survival rates when used in surgical excisions. However, the clinical use of LA is restricted due to their systemic toxicity. The development of drug delivery systems could address this issue and advance the utilization of these molecules. In this research, we explored the pharmacokinetics (using microdialysis probes) and antitumor properties of a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) formulation containing the commercially available enantiomeric excess form of bupivacaine (BVCS75). This NLC was prepared with lavender oil (NLC-L-BVC), an excipient with inherent antitumor properties. We compared this formulation to a control (NLC-BVC) using synthetic lipids. Pharmacokinetic assessments of the NLCs confirmed the sustained release of BVCS75 within the tumor, characterized by a reduced elimination rate constant and longer half-life (∼6×). The encapsulation of BVCS75 within nanoparticles (whether natural or synthetic) enhanced its effectiveness in treating the primary tumor, resulting in the inhibition of tumor growth (70% with NLC-L-BVC and 72% with NLC-BVC), outperforming free BVC (17% inhibition). However, the association of lavender oil with BVCS75 in an NLC did not yield synergistic properties. Furthermore, all BVCS75 treatments (whether free or encapsulated) improved animal survival rates. These findings confirm that encapsulation of bupivacaine in NLC can prolong drug action at the local site, contributing to improved local antitumor therapy while mitigating systemic effects."

DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled experimental study. The study population consisted of patients aged 9-12 years who were about to undergo endoscopy in a tertiary center. The study sample consisted of 66 children (intervention = 22; placebo = 22; control = 22). Data were collected using a randomized controlled trial with the Sociodemographic Data Collection Form prepared by the researcher and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) scale. RESULTS: The STAIC state and trait anxiety states of the participants were compared between the groups and no statistically significant difference was found in terms of STAIC trait anxiety scores (p > 0.05). When the STAIC state anxiety scores were compared, it was found that participants in the intervention group had a statistically significantly lower state anxiety score (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lavender oil inhalation was effective in reducing pre-procedural anxiety in children. APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: Healthcare professionals can use lavender oil as an aromatherapy method to reduce children's anxiety in clinical settings."

To determine the clinical efficacy of lavender oil in comparison with Piroxicam gel (PG) for the treatment of knee OA. A double-blind trial with 90 patients utilized random blocks to divide them into three groups including the lavender oil group, the PG group, and the control group for treatment comparison. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were used to measure aspects of osteoarthritis, particularly physical function, pain, and stiffness. Control group had no change in VAS pain scores. Lavender oil and PG reduced scores after one month, but remained unchanged after two months. The VAS scores of the lavender oil group exhibited a significant reduction from 5.37 ± 0.68 to 3.00 ± 0.64, while PG decreased VAS score from 5.45 ± 0.98 to 3.62 ± 1.26 (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. Altogether, Lavender oil has a similar effect as PG on pain severity and physical function in patients with knee OA. Lavender oil is recommended as an effective natural therapeutic agent and safe complementary treatment for knee OA."

This systematic review investigated the effects of inhaled lavender aromatherapy on postoperative pain relief and analgesic consumption in adults. METHODS: We searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, Medline (Ovid), and Scopus databases up to October 01, 2023. Pain score was the primary outcome, and analgesics consumption was the secondary outcome. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and evidence strength was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, 14 published in 2015 or later. Most studies were conducted in Iran (9 studies, 60%) and the USA (5 studies, 33%). Participants primarily underwent cardiac (5 studies, 33%) or abdominal surgery (6 studies, 40%). Pain levels were mainly assessed at 5, 30, and 60 minutes after intervention. Regarding the consumption of postoperative analgesics, three studies reported reduced postoperative analgesic use with lavender aromatherapy, while the other three studies found no notable effect. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled lavender aromatherapy significantly reduced postoperative pain in adults. However, evidence is insufficient to confirm its effect on reducing analgesic consumption. Further high-quality randomized clinical trials are needed to draw definitive conclusions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine whether aromatherapy with peppermint (Mentha piperita Mitcham), ginger (Zingiber officinale), and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) reduces the severity of nausea in patients experiencing postoperative nausea after oral surgery under general anaesthesia. DESIGN: Single-centre, stratified (volatile inhaled anaesthetics used or not and sex, with balanced randomization), single-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in Japan. SETTING: Hokkaido University Hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Totally, 182 patients were randomized into two groups of aromatherapy: aroma group comprising three essential oils-peppermint, ginger, and lavender-each diluted to 1 % (each dose as pure essential oil was 0.01 ml) and control group with purified water only. Of these, 32 patients in the aroma group and 25 in the control group complained of postoperative nausea and were treated with intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in nausea severity at the onset of postoperative nausea. RESULTS: Nausea severity before the intervention did not differ between groups. Aromatherapy significantly reduced nausea severity (p < 0.001). The percentages of antiemetics used were 30.77 % and 52.38 % in the aroma and control groups, respectively, with no significant difference. The aroma group showed significantly higher satisfaction (p < 0.001). No adverse events were observed during the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that aromatherapy with peppermint, ginger, and lavender significantly improved patient satisfaction and severity of postoperative nausea after oral surgery under general anaesthesia. Therefore, given the benefits of aromatherapy, it would be advantageous to consider a combination of measures that include aromatherapy, as one of the multimodal antiemetic measures. This trial was registered at the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs: 01121002).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Patients requiring endodontic treatment often experience high levels of anxiety. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of oral administration of lavender on the anxiety score of these patients. METHODS: In this double-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted in 2021, 64 patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis were recruited using a simple random sampling technique. Blinding was achieved for both the patients and the evaluators. The samples were split into intervention and control groups using a table of random integers to randomize them. An hour before the commencement of the procedure, the patients filled out the dental anxiety questionnaire. Twenty drops of water in 250 ml of water were given to the control group, whereas 20 drops of lavender extract added to 250 ml of water were given to the intervention group. Two groups completed the anxiety questionnaire 60 minutes after ingesting the remedies. To analyse the data, paired and independent t-tests, and multiple regression analysis were used. RESULTS: 64 patients were randomized and analyzed. Thirty-two of them who were in the control group experienced a substantially smaller decrease in their dental anxiety score compared to those 32 patients who were in the control group (p=0.001). This difference persisted even after grouping individuals by age, sex, and weight. CONCLUSION: The administration of oral lavender extract drops to individuals requiring endodontic treatment appeared to significantly reduce their dental anxiety scores.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Nurses often experience high levels of physical and psychological stress due to frequent exposure to emergency and critical situations, which can adversely affect their professional performance. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the short- and long-term impacts of combining aromatherapy with music therapy versus using aromatherapy alone on the physical and psychological well-being of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This study employed a quasi-experimental design without non-intervention control group and recruited 60 nurses from a regional teaching hospital in central Taiwan between February and November 2023. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one group received aromatherapy, and the other group received a combination of aromatherapy and music therapy. The aromatherapy intervention involved inhaling gas infused with lavender essential oil. The intervention was conducted once a week during the lunch break for 20 min over a six-week period. Physiological and psychological indicators were compared before and after the intervention. Physiological indicators included systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate (PR). Psychological indicators included scores on the Nursing Stress Scale (NSS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which measured stress, anxiety, and depression, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, after each aromatherapy intervention, the physiological and psychological measures of the nurses in both groups showed significant reductions (p < 0.05) based on paired t-tests. After six measurements, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted, revealing that most physiological and psychological measures of the nurses in the aromatherapy-only group were significantly reduced (p < 0.05), although no significant differences were found for diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate. In the group receiving aromatherapy combined with music therapy, all physiological and psychological measures showed significant reductions in repeated measures tests (p < 0.05). These results suggest that aromatherapy combined with music therapy not only improved physical and psychological symptoms immediately but also had lasting effects for at least six weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that aromatherapy effectively reduced the physical and psychological stress of nurses, with even greater benefits when combined with music therapy. This approach not only provided immediate effects but also were associated with lasting benefits for an extended duration.",

The intervention group received aromatherapy with clove and lavender essential oils, while the control group received standard care. The effectiveness of aromatherapy in reducing post-operative headaches was measured using the Visual Analog Scale. Data analysis was performed using SPSS25. RESULTS: The study found that, while both lavender and clove aromatherapy reduced headache severity compared to the control group at 8 and 24 h post-surgery, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). However, a significant reduction in headache severity was observed in all three groups, with lavender and clove groups showing a greater reduction than the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Aromatherapy could be a simple, affordable, and safe way to reduce pain and the need for post-surgical sedatives.

We evaluated the therapeutic effects of lavender oil (Lavandula angustifolia) in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) with experimentally induced thrombosis. Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into control, thrombosis, diabetes, thrombosis-diabetes, and lavender oil pretreatment groups (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight [bw]). Lavender oil exhibited dose-dependent benefits, with the 200 mg/kg bw dose leading to significant reductions in proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES); and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)) and oxidative stress, along with improved glycemic control, the partial restoration of C-peptide levels, and the attenuation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) activity (p < 0.0001). Histopathological and coagulation analyses confirmed its organ-protective and antithrombotic effects, including reduced tissue damage, vascular inflammation, and thrombus formation, and prolonged bleeding and clotting times. Our findings suggest that lavender oil exhibits dose-dependent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and organ-protective effects, indicating its potential as a complementary therapy for managing inflammation in T1DM with or without thrombosis."

Complementary therapy for infectious diseases can rely on natural substances with antibacterial activity, e.g., essential oils and honeys. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of linden and chestnut honeys, lavender essential oil, and their combinations against the multidrug-resistant otitis media pathogens Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The efficacy of these natural substances was compared with each other and antibiotics used in clinical practice. METHODS: Microscopic pollen analysis and physicochemical traits were used to confirm the botanical origin of honey samples. The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria was tested with a disk diffusion assay. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using a microdilution assay. A 24 h immature biofilm eradication test was performed with a crystal violet assay. The efficacy of combinations was tested with a checkerboard titration method. The DNA release of damaged bacterial cells was measured using a membrane degradation assay. RESULTS: Lavender essential oil displayed more potent antibacterial activity compared to the honey samples. However, honey-essential oil combinations showed higher inhibition rates for biofilm eradication, with P. aeruginosa being the most resistant bacterium. The combined use of chestnut honey and lavender oil resulted in a higher degree of membrane degradation in a shorter time, and their synergistic effect was proven with checkerboard titration. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of linden or chestnut honey with lavender essential oil was shown to be effective in the eradication of a 24 h immature biofilm formed by H. parainfluenzae, M. catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae."

The purpose of this study is to look into how autonomic variability in healthy volunteers is affected by both inhaling lavender oil and taking cold foot baths. METHODS: A total of 60 healthy individuals were randomized to be placed in either the control group (n=30) or the experimental group (n=30) and were instructed to attend a single designated session. The control group underwent a 20-minute cold foot bath, while the experimental group received a 20-minute cold foot bath combined with lavender oil inhalation. Assessments were carried out before, during, and after the interventions. OUTCOME MEASURES: To evaluate autonomic variables, we monitored galvanic skin response (GSR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) using an equivital belt. Furthermore, we measured blood pressure (BP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) before, during (20 minutes) the intervention, and after a 10-minute resting period; post-intervention measurements were taken. RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis revealed a significant difference in standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), pNN50, and heart rate (HR) for time-domain variables (p<0.05), whereas the frequency-domain analysis showed a significant difference over time in LF/HF, LF, and HF (p<0.05). When these were compared between the groups, a significant difference was observed only in LF and HF (p<0.04). Additionally, a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) in diastolic and systolic blood pressure between the groups was noted. CONCLUSION: The combination of a cold foot bath and lavender oil inhalation may modulate autonomic activity, promoting relaxation by vagal balance in healthy individuals."

      "abstract": "The misuse of tetracycline in livestock farming leads to environmental residues that promote the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), particularly tetracycline resistance (tet) genes. Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae, used for organic waste bioconversion, may carry tetracycline residues in their guts, raising concerns about ARG spread. To address this issue, plant-derived additives such as lavender essential oil (LEO) have been explored as alternative antibiotics. This study investigated the effects of LEO on tet gene suppression and gut microbiota modulation in BSF larvae. Results showed that oxytetracycline treatment increased tet gene relative abundance threefold compared to the control, reaching 1.13 ± 0.29 and enriched pathogens Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter hormaechei. Conversely, LEO treatment (100 mg/kg) reduced tet gene abundance by 46.67 %, from 0.15 ± 0.02 to 0.08 ± 0.02, and enhanced beneficial microorganisms like Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides. Furthermore, LEO reduced tet gene relative abundance in oxytetracycline-treated larvae from 1.13 ± 0.29 to 0.49 ± 0.19 and 0.70 ± 0.11 in separate treatments. LEO modified fungal composition and nutrient pathways. Network analysis revealed that LEO promoted a more integrated and modular gut microbiota, enhancing functional specialization and resilience. These findings suggest LEO can mitigate ARGs in BSF larvae, offering a sustainable approach for antibiotic resistance management in organic waste recycling and livestock farming.",

      "abstract": "Lavender is one of the most appreciated aromatic plants, with high economic value in food, cosmetics, perfumery, and pharmaceutical industries. Lavender essential oil (LEO) is known to have demonstrative antimicrobial, antioxidant, therapeutic, flavor and fragrance properties. Conventional extraction methods, e.g., steam distillation (SD) and hydro-distillation (HD), have been traditionally employed to extract LEO. However, the low yield, high energy consumption, and long extraction time of conventional methods have prompted the introduction of novel extraction technologies. Some of these innovative approaches, such as ohmic-assisted, microwave-assisted, supercritical fluid, and subcritical water extraction approaches, are used as substitutes to conventional extraction methods. While other methods, e.g., sonication, pulsed electric field, and cold plasma, can be used as a pre-treatment that is preceded by conventional or emerging extraction technologies. These innovative approaches have a great significance in reducing the energy consumption, shortening the extraction time, and increasing the extraction yield and the quality of EOs. Therefore, they can be considered as sustainable extraction technologies. However, the scale-up of emerging technologies to an industrial level should also be investigated from the techno-economic points of view in future studies."

Growing research interest is focusing on the biological roles of natural compounds due to their potential beneficial effects on health. Our research aimed to investigate the effects of lavender essential oil (LEO) on a GBM cell model. Chemical characterization using GC-MS analysis indicated that LEO contains several terpenes, compounds that have been found to exhibit anticancer properties by interfering with key cancer-related pathways in several cancer models. By means of cell biology assays, we demonstrated that LEO impairs cell proliferation and migration, and also reduces oxidative stress in U87 cells. We further observed that Terpinen-4-ol, contained in LEO, was capable of reproducing the effects of the oil on GBM cells. Our results suggest that the terpenic molecules present in LEO could be considered valuable allies alongside conventional therapies against GBM.",

DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. METHODS: This study was conducted on 90 patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy at Bahonar Hospital in Kerman in 2021. The patients were selected by convenience sampling method and randomly assigned to three groups: lavender, rosemary, and control. After general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, an anesthesiologist put sterile gauzes impregnated with 3 cc of rosemary and lavender extracts into patients' throats in the intervention groups, while the control group received 3 cc of distilled water. After the surgery, the gauzes and tracheal tubes were removed and the patients were transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), their sore throat and hoarseness were measured and recorded during and 2 to 6 to 24 hours after recovery. A significance level of < .05 was considered. FINDINGS: The study results showed a significant difference in the severity of sore throat between the 3 groups 2, 6, and 24 hours after surgery; sore throat in the rosemary group and then in the lavender group was lower than that in the control group (P < .05). The results also indicated a significant difference in hoarseness intensity between the three groups 2 and 6 hours after surgery; hoarseness intensity in the rosemary and lavender groups was lower than that in the control group, but it was not different between 3 groups 24 hours after surgery (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Rosemary and lavender extracts had a positive effect on sore throat and hoarseness. As these herbs cause no complications in patients and are available and inexpensive, further studies are necessary to confirm the use of these herbs during intubation."

      "abstract": "For a given aquatic ecosystem that will be used as a water source, it is necessary to establish the quality of the water from a microbiological point of view by identifying the pathogens present in the water. The aim of this study was to determine and analyze the antimicrobial activity of some biocides derived from garlic (garlic-methanol extract) and lavender (lavender-water extract). Their efficiency was evaluated at different concentrations and contact times. Initially, through specific laboratory analyses, the microbiological characteristics of the river were determined. Biomimetic studies on the antimicrobial activity of biocides based on garlic and lavender in surface waters involved detailed exploration of how the natural antimicrobial properties of these plants can be effectively utilized to treat water contaminated with harmful microorganisms. Both the contact time and the amount of biocide used have a significant effect on the microorganisms of interest. Thus, to describe the degradation rate of coliform bacteria, a pseudo-first-order and zero-order kinetic model was used, r=-(dN/dt)=kobs·t şi r0=kobs·N0=k0, where r is the rate of degradation of microorganisms (CFU/min), N0 is the initial number of microorganisms in the aqueous solution (colony-forming unit, CFU), N is the final number of microorganisms after a contact time t (CFU), kobs is the pseudo-first-order rate constant (min-1), t is the contact time (min), r0 is the initial rate of degradation of microorganisms (CFU/min), and k0 is the pseudo-rate constant zero order (min-1). Following 60 min of treatment with 1 mL of lavender-water biocide, the inhibition rate of pathogenic microorganisms in the water reached 59.09%, whereas, under the same conditions, the garlic-methanol biocide achieved an inhibition rate of 40.86%. This study confirms the antimicrobial activity of both lavender and garlic biocides, highlighting their potential in mitigating water pollution caused by pathogens."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Managing postoperative setting, regarding pain and anxiety after cesarean delivery is crucial for the mother's recovery, her emotional well-being, mother-infant bonding and initiating breastfeeding. Although some research have suggested that aromatherapy with lavender essential oil can be effective in reducing pain and anxiety in various medical settings, the efficacy of lavender aromatherapy in the postoperative setting after cesarean delivery is less well-studied. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of lavender essential oil therapy in the management of pain and anxiety after cesarean delivery. METHODS: This was a monocentric randomized controlled double-blind trial conducted over a period of five months during 2023. A hundred women undergoing c-sections under spinal anesthesia were enrolled and randomly assigned; using block randomization of 4 items per block with allocation ratio 1:1, into two groups: The aromatherapy group (receiving inhaled Lavender essential oil) versus the placebo group (receiving distilled water instead). The primary outcomes were pain (at rest and after mobilization) and anxiety levels and after the intervention. This trial was registered on clinical-trials.org (NCT06387849). RESULTS: A total of 100 women were included (50 women in each group aromatherapy and the placebo group). The two groups were comparable regarding baseline characteristics and pre-intervention parameters with no statistically significant difference. After the intervention, the pain at rest (38,76 ± 22,9 vs. 23,84 ± 18,01; p < 0.001), the pain after mobilization (60,28 ± 23,72 vs. 40,12 ± 22,18; p < 0.001), and degree of anxiety (46,76 ± 6,59 vs. 44,3 ± 5,17; p = 0.03) were all significantly lower in the aromatherapy group. No adverse effects were reported by participants in both groups. CONCLUSION: Aromatherapy using Lavender essential oil is effective in reducing pain and anxiety after cesarean delivery without adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of insomnia-related diseases, the effective treatment of insomnia has become an important health research topic. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.) essential oil (LEO) is a commonly used medicine for the treatment of insomnia and neurological disorders. However, neither the active components nor its sedative-hypnotic mechanism have been fully discovered. This study aimed to screen the main active terpenes and discover the possible mechanism of LEO through network pharmacology in the treatment of insomnia-related diseases, as well as to verify our hypothesis in insomnia mice. The results showed that, in LEO's 15 potential active ingredients, beta-myrcene had strong sedative-hypnotic effects through the serotonergic synaptic pathway according to the network pharmacological prediction. Further, PCPA(DL-4-chlorophenylalanine)-induced insomnia mice were treated with beta-myrcene for one day or seven days. The quiet state of insomnia mice was increased effectively, and the hypnotic effect was enhanced by anaobarbital sodium by prolonging sleep duration, decreasing sleep latency, and increasing the rate of falling asleep. Beta-myrcene reduced the damage to hypothalamic neuron cells induced by PCPA and increased neurotransmitter levels of GABA, 5-HT, and Glu in the serum and hypothalamus of insomnia mice. Meanwhile, beta-myrcene exerted an improvement in insomnia by upregulating relevant genes and protein expression in the serotonergic synaptic pathway. These results support the merit of the sedative-hypnotic activity of LEO. Beta-myrcene, a terpene in LEO, may be the main source of its sedative-hypnotic properties. It may serve as a good potential compound in future clinical studies on coping with insomnia."

Complementary therapies including massage and aromatherapy are widely used in the management of HTN. However, studies on aromatherapy massage in HTN are limited. Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of lavender oil leg massage on physical (cardiopulmonary function), cognitive, and psychological variables of patients with HTN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A parallel-group randomized controlled trial, comprising 100 HTN patients aged 44.99 ± 5.39 years who were recruited and randomly divided into the study group (SG) and control group (CG), was conducted. The SG received lavender oil leg massage, while the CG received supine rest for 20 min. Outcome variables like blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR), random blood sugar (RBS) level, oxygen saturation, pulmonary function, oral temperature, trail making test (TMT) A and B, and state anxiety and mindfulness were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The within-group analysis showed a significant improvement in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, PR, RBS, TMT-A, TMT-B, and state mindfulness both in the SG and CG. However, a significant reduction in state anxiety was observed only in the SG unlike the CG. Moreover, the between-group analysis showed a significant improvement in state mindfulness and state anxiety in the SG compared to the CG. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that lavender oil leg massage is effective in reducing BP and RBS, and improving cognitive function in hypertensive patients. In addition, it is more effective in reducing anxiety and improving mindfulness than rest in supine position in patients with HTN."

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Health centers in Roudan city, Iran. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty married women, ages 18 to 45 years, were recruited using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Participants were selected from health centers in 2022 via convenience sampling. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Upon their completion of a demographic checklist and the FSFI as a pretest, participants were divided into three groups, including lavender aromatherapy (n = 20), MBCT-S (n = 20), and control (n = 20) through random selection with permutation blocks. All groups completed FSFI as a posttest. Data were analyzed by SPSS 26 using chi-square, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney statistical tests. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference among the three groups before the intervention (p = .652), but there was a significant difference among them after the intervention (p = .001). There was a significantly positive difference between the intervention groups and the control group (p < .001). A significant relationship was observed among the three groups in sexual desire, pain, satisfaction, lubrication, and arousal. The mean scores of the posttest in sexual desire, pain, satisfaction, and lubrication were positively higher in the MBCT-S group than in the aromatherapy group, and both intervention groups showed the same effect for sexual arousal. Aromatherapy and counseling had no significant effect on improving sexual orgasm. CONCLUSION: MBCT-S can be used to improve many aspects of female sexual function, except for orgasm disorders; aromatherapy may improve sexual arousal.",

METHODS: The study was conducted with 63 participants aged 65 and over. Participants were randomly divided into three groups: lavender, rosemary and control groups. The intervention continued for four weeks. Data was collected using the Blessed Orientation Concentration Test, State-Trait Anxiety Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale. Data were analyzed using One-Way ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U/Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon and Friedman tests. RESULTS: In both intervention groups, the 4th week scores of cognitive functions, anxiety, and sleep quality after aromatherapy were significant compared to the baseline scores. In the control group, state anxiety scores were significantly higher in the 2nd and 4th weeks compared to the initial scores. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaling lavender and rosemary has been observed to improve cognitive function and sleep quality and reduce anxiety levels. The effects of the essential oils used in the research were evaluated over four weeks. It is thought that studying for a longer period and with more samples would be beneficial. There is a need for studies examining its effects, especially in the elderly with diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Apocynin (APO) is a plant derived antioxidant exerting specific NADPH oxidase inhibitory action substantiating its neuroprotective effects in various CNS disorders, including epilepsy. Due to rapid elimination and poor bioavailability, treatment with APO is challenging. Correspondingly, novel APO-loaded lipid nanocapsules (APO-LNC) were formulated and coated with lactoferrin (LF-APO-LNC) to improve br ain targetability and prolong residence time. Lavender oil (LAV) was incorporated into LNC as a bioactive ingredient to act synergistically with APO in alleviating pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures. The optimized LF-APO-LAV/LNC showed a particle size 59.7 ± 4.5 nm with narrow distribution and 6.07 ± 1.6mV zeta potential) with high entrapment efficiency 92 ± 2.4% and sustained release (35% in 72 h). Following subcutaneous administration, LF-APO-LAV/LNC brought about ⁓twofold increase in plasma AUC and MRT compared to APO. A Log BB value of 0.2 ± 0.14 at 90 min reflects increased brain accumulation. In a PTZ-induced seizures rat model, LF-APO-LAV/LNC showed a Modified Racine score of 0.67 ± 0.47 with a significant increase in seizures latency and decrease in duration. Moreover, oxidant/antioxidant capacity and inflammatory markers levels in brain tissue were significantly improved. Histopathological and immunohistochemical assessment of brain tissue sections further supported these findings. The results suggest APO/LAV combination in LF-coated LNC as a promising approach to counteract seizures.",

      "abstract": "Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes a variety of infections outside the intestine. The treatment of these infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains, which can also be a direct or indirect threat to humans as consumers of poultry products. Therefore, alternative antimicrobial agents are being sought, which could be essential oils, either administered individually or in interaction with antibiotics. Sixteen field isolates of E. coli (originating from 1-day-old broilers) and the ATCC 25922 reference strain were tested. Commercial cinnamon bark, clove bud, lavender flower essential oils (EOs) and enrofloxacin were selected to assess the sensitivity of the selected E. coli strains to antimicrobial agents. The checkerboard method was used to estimate the individual minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each antimicrobial agent as well as to determine the interactions between the selected essential oil and enrofloxacin. In the case of enrofloxacin, ten isolates were resistant at MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL, three were classified as intermediate (0.5-1 μg/mL) and three as sensitive at ≤0.25 μg/mL. Regardless of the sensitivity to enrofloxacin, the MIC for cinnamon EO was 0.25% v/v and for clove EO was 0.125% v/v. All MDR strains had MIC values for lavender EO of 1% v/v, while drug-sensitive isolates had MIC of 0.5% v/v. Synergism between enrofloxacin and EO was noted more frequently in lavender EO (82.35%), followed by cinnamon EO (64.7%), than in clove EO (47.1%). The remaining cases exhibited additive effects. Owing to synergy, the isolates became susceptible to enrofloxacin at an MIC of ≤8 µg/mL. A time-kill study supports these observations. Cinnamon and clove EOs required for up to 1 h and lavender EO for up to 4 h to completely kill a multidrug-resistant strain as well as the ATCC 25922 reference strain of E. coli. Through synergistic or additive effects, blends with a lower than MIC concentration of enrofloxacin mixed with a lower EO content required 6 ± 2 h to achieve a similar effect.",

Antidepressant drugs have been demonstrated to be efficacious in anxiety as well. Vice versa, it may also be promising to investigate the efficacy of anxiolytic drugs such as silexan in major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with a mild or moderate, single or recurrent episode of MDD and a total score of 19-34 points on the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were randomized to receive 1 × 80 mg/d silexan, 1 × 50 mg/d sertraline, or placebo double-blind, double-dummy for 56 days. The primary outcome measure was the MADRS total score change between baseline and treatment end. Treatment groups were compared using a treatment policy estimand. 498 subjects (silexan 170, sertraline 171, placebo 157) were treated and analyzed. After 8 weeks, silexan and sertraline were superior to placebo for MADRS total score reduction, with absolute differences to placebo of 2.17 (95% confidence interval: 0.58; 3.76) points and 2.59 (1.02; 4.17) points, respectively (p < 0.01). Moreover, silexan was superior to placebo for alleviation of functional impairment according to the Sheehan Disability Scale with a difference of 2.40 (1.04; 3.76) points (p < 0.001). Both treatments were well tolerated; eructation was the most frequent adverse effect of silexan. The study confirms the antidepressant efficacy of silexan in mild or moderate MDD, including significant improvements in the subjects' functional capacity. The results for sertraline confirm the assay sensitivity of the trial. Both drugs were well tolerated.Trial registrationEudraCT2020-000688-22 first entered on 12/08/2020."

      "abstract": "Background: Intraoperative anxiety is a common problem when Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) is used instead of general anesthesia during minor surgical procedures such as port catheter placement. Nonpharmacological anxiolytics such as aromatherapy have been studied for their effects on preoperative anxiety, but no placebo-controlled study of aromatherapy during surgeries under MAC has yet been performed. Methods: After IRB approval, 70 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either a lavender/peppermint aromatherapy patch (Elequil Aromatabs®; Beekley Corporation) or a matching placebo patch. The primary outcome, time to readiness for discharge from postoperative acute care units (PACU; min), was assessed every 15 min until a modified postanesthesia recovery score for ambulatory patients (PARSAP) score of 18 or higher was reached. In the preoperative holding area, the assigned patch/placebo was activated and affixed to a folded towel placed aside the subject's head, contralateral to the side of the planned surgery. The towel and patch/placebo were discarded when the subject left the operating room (OR). Results: No difference was found between the treatment and placebo groups on the primary outcome of time to discharge readiness (mean [standard deviation, SD]: 82 [15] vs. 89 [21] min, respectively, p = 0.131). No difference was found between the treatment and placebo groups on the secondary outcomes of intraoperative midazolam dose, intraoperative opioid dose, intraoperative ondansetron dose, or intraoperative promethazine dose. No difference was found between the treatment and placebo groups in the proportion of subjects requiring rescue postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) medication in the PACU or the proportion of subjects requiring opioids in the PACU. No difference was found between the treatment and placebo groups in pain intensity in PACU, average PONV score in PACU, or patient satisfaction in PACU. PACU patient satisfaction was high for both the patch and placebo groups (35/35 [100%] vs. 32/34 [94%] \"very satisfied,\" p = 0.239). Conclusions: Aromatherapy treatment is not indicated intraoperatively to reduce anxiety or the use of antiemetics in patients requiring Port catheter placement.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of contraceptive methods is influenced by their effectiveness, availability, and minimal side effects. OCPs are one of the most effective and widely used methods of pregnancy prevention worldwide. This method not only prevents pregnancy but also helps prevent and treat other diseases. One of the main reasons for discontinuing this method is the emotional disturbances associated with its use. Lavender is an evergreen, fragrant plant that has gained significant attention for its anti-anxiety effects. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of lavender essential oil capsules on mood disorders during the use of COCs. METHODS: This triple-blinded clinical trial was conducted on 60 married women (aged 15-49 years old) who were consumers of COCs, referring to 26 health centers in Tabriz, Iran. The participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention (consuming one gelatin capsule containing 80 mg LEO daily) or control (consuming one placebo capsule daily) group. The intervention continued for 56 days. Scores for positive and negative were determined using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) questionnaire; and for stress, depression, and anxiety were measured using the DASS-21 questionnaire on day's 28th and 56th post-intervention. Data analysis was conducted using the t-test and ANOVA with repeated measures, and a p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was observed in mood disorders, stress, and depression between women receiving LEO or placebo. The consumption of LEO increased the positive mood on day 28 [MD (95% CI): 4.5 (2.1 to 7.0), p = 0.001] and day 56 [5.9 (3.4 to 8.3), p < 0.001] while decreased the negative mood on day 28 [MD (95% CI): -3.5 (-5.3 to -1.3), p < 0.001] and day 56 [-4.3 (-6.3 to -2.2), p < 0.001], stress on day 28 [MD (95% CI): -4.9 (-7.1 to -2.8), p = 0.001] and day 56 [-5.3 (-7.6 to -3.1), p < 0. 001], and depression on day 28 [MD (95% CI): -3.0 (-4.9 to 1.1), p = 0.003] and day 56 [-3.1 (-5.0 to 1.2), p = 0.002]. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of LEO with COCs improved mood disorders and reduced stress and depression. The use of hormonal contraceptives and mood changes should be considered by providers. Therefore, regarding the possibility of mood changes, it is expected that appropriate counseling and education will be provided to women who consume COC., providing appropriate solutions, including the simultaneous use of LEO.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 56 children aged 6-10 years old who needed dental treatment with inferior alveolar nerve injection (IANB) were randomly divided into two groups: Group 1 (Experimental, n = 28) aromatherapy with music group, and Group 2 (Control, n = 28) the placebo group. Children in the group 1 were asked to inhale the aromatic blend of Lavender-Neroli essential oil using a nasal mask similar to one that is used for nitrous oxide after modifying it by adding a 3D printed box on its circle hole and listening to their favorite music as a background before 5 min and during anesthesia, meanwhile in the placebo group children were asked to wear an empty nasal mask. Anxiety and pain were been assessed before and after anesthesia using the self-report anxiety scale Facial image scale (FIS), Observational pain assessment scale Face-Legs-Activity-Cry-Consolability (FLACC), heart rate, SPO2 saturation, diastolic and systolic blood pressure. RESULTS: Dental anxiety and vital signs except SPO2 saturation were significantly lower in the aromatherapy with music group when compared to the control group (p < 0.05), with no differences in pain perception between groups (p = 0.176). CONCLUSIONS: Aromatherapy with Lavender-Neroli oil combined with music seems to be a useful and safe non-pharmacologic technique for managing dental anxiety in children."

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of inhalation of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) oil and its major components (linalool and linalyl acetate) on the pain in patients with PHN. METHODS: This study was performed at an outpatient clinic. Sixty-four patients with postherpetic neuralgia were randomly allocated to a control group (almond oil) or one of three experimental groups (lavender oil, linalool, or linalyl acetate diluted in almond oil at concentration of 1% v/v), and the participants inhaled the aroma by natural breathing. Quality, severity, and intensity of pain were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Six patients discontinued the intervention for personal reasons; hence, data from 58 patients were analyzed (control group, n = 14; 1% lavender oil group, n = 15; 1% linalool, n = 15; 1% linalyl acetate, n = 14). Reduction in sensory pain was greater in the 1% lavender oil group, 1% linalool group, and 1% linalyl acetate group than in the control group (all P < 0.001). Reduction in affective pain was greater in the 1% lavender group (P < 0.001) and the 1% linalool group (P = 0.007) than in the control group. Decreases in pain severity and intensity were significantly greater in all three intervention groups than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Inhalation of lavender oil and its major volatile components effectively reduced the quality, severity, and intensity of postherpetic pain, suggesting that lavender oil, linalool, and linalyl acetate may each be an effective intervention for reducing pain in patients with postherpetic neuralgia.

      "abstract": "The demand for natural products in the treatment of dermatological pathologies has boosted the use of bioactive substances such as lavender essential oil (LEO), which stands out for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and its antimicrobial potential. Biopolymers such as chitosan (CHT) and alginate (ALG) are biodegradable and biocompatible and have proven their viability in biomedical applications such as skin regeneration. The inhibitory effect of LEO on the growth of skin-related bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus Candida albicans was studied by incorporating 1% v/v LEO encapsulated in CHT, ALG, and CHT/ALG membranes. Despite the verification of the antimicrobial effect of all type of membranes, no synergistic effect was observed following the addition of LEO. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa showed the most growth on the different substrates and C. albicans demonstrated the highest inhibition. This is a first approach using microorganisms isolated from clinical samples or skin microbiota. Further investigation would be advisable using more clinical strains for each microorganism to validate their biomedical applicability."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-stroke depression (PSD) has major implications for rehabilitation, motor recovery, activities of daily living, social and interpersonal functioning, and mortality. In view of the side effects of antidepressants, aromatherapy, a widely used non-pharmacological therapy, has received growing attention in recent years for its benefits of reduced complications, accessibility, and effectiveness. This study was designed to assess the effects of inhalation aromatherapy with lavender essential oil on depression and sleep quality in patients with PSD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with PSD were enrolled and randomized into experimental and placebo groups. Experimental-group patients inhaled microencapsulated lavender essential oil every night at bedtime over a period of 4 weeks. A nonwoven bag containing 2.3 g of microcapsules with about 1.5 g of lavender essential oil was placed on or under the patient's pillow, depending on the patient's scent sensitivity. Placebo-group patients used the empty nonwoven bags for the same period as the experimental group. The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to measure outcomes. RESULTS: The HAMD-17 score, SDS score, and PSQI score showed statistically significant differences between both groups before and after intervention (P ≤ 0.01). The improvement in the experimental group was more marked than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Lavender essential oil inhalation aromatherapy may help reduce depression and improve sleep quality in patients with PSD.",

Recently, alternative and contemporary medical approaches such as aromatherapy have received much attention. The potential effects of essential oils such as lavender and patchouli have been found to reduce anxiety, improve mood, and increase sedation. Thus, the study was conducted to compare the evaluation of lavender and patchouli essential oils used in aromatherapy and their effect on dental anxiety in children. AIM: To compare the efficacy of lavender and patchouli essential oils in aromatherapy and its effect on dental anxiety in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 children between 6 and 12 years were randomly allocated to either an experimental or control group that received lavender and patchouli before dental treatment. Child anxiety was measured by using the Chotta Bheem-Chutki scale. A pulse oximeter was used to record the pulse rate. Data was tabulated and analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in anxiety score and pulse rate between the intervals. Statistical differences were observed in the lavender group compared to patchouli oil. CONCLUSION: The positive effects of both lavender and patchouli oil on children can be used to reduce anxiety in children. In our study, lavender oil showed slightly better results than patchouli oil. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Tripathy S, Kohli A, Sharma K, et al.

METHODS: The study was completed with 36 patients. The treatment group included 18 patients, and the control group had 18. The data were collected through patient information form, visual analog scale, and state anxiety scale. Before the brachytherapy, three sessions of hand massages, each lasting 10 min (5 min for each hand), were performed using baby oil with lavender. Data collection forms were repeated after each session. The control group received routine treatment. Study groups were similar and homogeneous in terms of socio-demographic characteristics. The data obtained were assessed using Shapiro Wilk, Repeated Measures ANOVA, chi-square, and paired samples t-test. RESULTS: At the end of the brachytherapy, the pain and state anxiety scores of the group that applied hand massage   were determined to be lower than the control group's at each three-time point (1st, 2nd, and 3rd-time points) (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: It was determined that hand massage using baby oil with lavender effectively reduced pain and anxiety. It can be practiced by certified nurses in clinics that perform brachytherapy as a noninvasive, safe, and affordable practice.",

Further investigations were demonstrated that LEO has many biological properties including apoptosis. However, The anti-breast cancer activity and mechanism of LEO are still unclear. we aim to elucidate the elusive anti-breast cancer activity and mechanism of LEO by unveiling the intricate molecular targets that it engages with, thereby priming it for effective therapeutic intervention against breast carcinoma. In this paper, we extracted LEO from lavender and analyzed it's chemical constituents by using hydro-distillation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GS-MS/MS) method, respectively. The active components against breast cancer and it's molecular targets were selected and biological process, molecular function, cellular component and involving pathways were evaluated via network pharmacology approach. Cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle assay were used to evaluate anti-breast cancer effect of LEO. Employing the western blotting method to validate target protein expression following LEO treatment in vitro. We found the 21 effective components and 213 drug-disease common targets of LEO. Amoung them, 7 active components and 19 targets were identified as potential therapeutic targets. Gene ontology results revealed that the drug-disease common targets of LEO were mainly distributed in membrane region, involved in peptide-tyrosine phosphorylation, and primarily associated with protein tyrosine kinase. We also found that drug-disease common targets might contribute to the regulation of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by using KEGG pathway analysis. Besides, our study demonstrated reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 treated with LEO while cell cycle arrest was not altered. The AKT1 expression down-regulated while PIK3CA expression was increased in both cell lines. Our findings indicate that LEO has the ability to induce apoptosis by modulating the expression of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in these cell lines."

The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to consolidate the findings from randomized clinical trial (RCT) studies examining the impact of aromatherapy with lavender on the pain associated with AVF catheter insertion and RLS in HD patients. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar search engine from inception to August 1, 2022, using keywords extracted from Medical Subject Headings, such as \"Aromatherapy\", \"Lavender\", \"Arteriovenous fistula\", \"Pain\", \"Restless legs syndrome\", and \"Hemodialysis\". RESULTS: Finally, eleven articles were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The results showed that aromatherapy reduced the average pain of catheter insertion in AVF compared to the control group (Standard Mean Difference: -1.60, 95% Confidence Interval: -2.32 to -0.87, Z=4.32, I2:90.3%, P<0.001). Also, aromatherapy massage reduced the average severity of RLS compared to the control group, which was statistically significant (Weighted Mean Difference: -13.21, 95% Confidence Interval: -17.50 to -8.91, Z=6.03, I2:93.0%, P<0.001). Also, the subgroup analysis showed that lavender in the intervention group significantly decreased the pain intensity compared to the \"no intervention\" group (P<0.001), yet it was not significant compared to the placebo group (P=0.12). CONCLUSION: In summary, the findings indicate a notable reduction in catheter insertion pain in AVF and relief from RLS among HD patients through the use of lavender essential oil. As a result, future research is encouraged to include a comparison of lavender's effects with those of a placebo group."

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent and disabling mental disorders, causing health-related burdens. With the increasing demand for and interest in safe and acceptable anxiolytics, several studies report the anxiolytic effects of lavender aromatherapy, providing evidence of its physiological and psychological effects. However, existing reviews comprehensively cover the effects of different modes of delivering aromatherapy. Therefore, this review assesses the efficacy of lavender essential oil inhalation in reducing anxiety. The titles and abstracts of relevant articles published over the last five years were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. This review only included clinical trials that utilized lavender inhalation for anxiety treatment. Eleven studies comprising 972 participants were included. Of these, 10 reported significantly decreased anxiety levels after lavender oil inhalation. The physiological measures of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse, and saturation, were conducted in three trials, showing that lavender oil inhalation could physiologically affect anxiety levels. Lavender oil inhalation is a safe and feasible anxiolytic intervention for treating people with diverse types of anxiety. Data from further studies with a high-quality design and accurate information are necessary to confirm the validity of these findings and elucidate the anxiety-reducing mechanisms of lavender inhalation."

Benzodiazepines, which are often used for anxiety in patients with anxiety disorder, have various side effects. Lavender, one of the most commonly used essential oils in aromatherapy, has the potential to reduce benzodiazepine use for anxiety disorders. METHODS: This study is a multicenter, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The study will recruit patients aged 20-59 years old with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder among anxiety disorders. The bottle containing the test solution (lavender aroma essential oil or distilled water) will be given to the patients. Patients will carry the bottles with them in their daily life and use the drops on tissue paper when anxious. The primary endpoint is the number of times anxiolytics used in 28 days. DISCUSSION: If the use of benzodiazepines could be reduced by sniffing lavender aroma, which is inexpensive and safe, it would contribute not only to the risks associated with benzodiazepine use but also to the health care economy and could even be added as a standard treatment.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to evaluate the impacts of lavender and metformin on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind clinical trial including 68 females aged 18 to 45, fulfilling the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS. The patients were randomized to receive lavender (250 mg twice daily) or metformin (500 mg three times a day) for 90 days. The serum progesterone was measured at baseline and after 90 days, one week before their expected menstruation. Moreover, the length of the menstrual cycle was documented. RESULTS: Our results showed that lavender and metformin treatment notably increased the progesterone levels in PCOS patients (increasing from 0.35 (0.66) and 0.8 (0.69) to 2.5 (6.2) and 2.74 (6.27) ng/mL, respectively, P < 0.001). However, we found no significant differences between the increasing effects of both treatments on progesterone levels. In addition, all patients in the lavender or metformin groups had baseline progesterone levels <3 ng/mL, reaching 14 (45.2%) patients >3 ng/mL. Lavender and metformin remarkably attenuated the menstrual cycle length in PCOS patients (decreasing from 56.0 (20.0) and 60 (12.0) to 42.0 (5.0) and 50.0 (14.0) days, respectively, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the decreasing effects of lavender on the menstrual cycle length were greater than the metformin group; however, it was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Lavender effectively increased progesterone levels and regulated the menstrual cycles in PCOS patients, similar to metformin. Therefore, lavender may be a promising candidate for the treatment of PCOS.",

Our study aimed to assess the efficacy of a Persian medicine formulation, lavender syrup, as an add-on to standard care in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this clinical trial which was conducted in Gorgan (Iran), 84 male and female COVID-19 outpatients were randomly allocated to either lavender syrup receiving 9 ml/twice/day for 21 days with standard conventional care or control groups. The primary objectives were to assess the improvement of clinical symptoms, while the secondary objectives were treatment satisfaction and anxiety levels which were evaluated once a week for 3 weeks. RESULTS: Out of 84 participants, 81 were analyzed (41 in the add-on group). The comparison between groups for cough severity and anosmia showed a higher reduction in the lavender group. The effect size was 0.6 for cough relief. Other symptoms and the Hamilton total score decreased in both groups with no statistically significant differences between the groups. The lavender group showed greater patients' satisfaction score. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive therapy with lavender syrup could reduce cough and improve the quality of life in patients with COVID-19 patients."

Additional non-pharmacological methods have come to the agenda as a result of the fact that the pain cannot be fully controlled, and the pharmacological treatment response is variable. Our research was intended to determine the effectiveness of lavender aromatherapy and cold application in controlling pain during drain removal procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample of the prospective randomized controlled study consisted of 121 patients. Patient data were collected using the introductory information form and the numerical pain scale. Four groups of patients were formed (lavender oil, oxygen, cold application, control), respectively. In all groups, vital signs and pain levels were evaluated before the drain removal procedure, as soon as and 15 minutes after it was withdrawn. RESULTS: Within the limits of study, lavender aromatherapy and cold application to the drainage area were found to be effective in reducing pain during drainage. When the effect on vital signs was evaluated, it was found that the pre-procedure systolic blood pressure was higher in both the lavender group and the cold application group than the post-procedure systolic blood pressure, and the respiratory rate was higher in the control group during the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: According to the study, it was found that applying lavender and cold application to the patients before the drainage procedure was effective in controlling pain.",

Traditional medicinal herbs have been used worldwide for the treatment of chronic liver diseases due to their high phytochemical constituents. The present study investigated the phytochemical properties of Croton gratissimus (lavender croton) leaf herbal tea and its hepatoprotective effect on oxidative injury in Chang liver cells, using an in vitro and in silico approach. C. gratissimus herbal infusion was screened for total phenolic and total flavonoid contents as well as in vitro antioxidant capacity using ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) methods. Oxidative hepatic injury was induced by incubating 0.007 M FeSO4 with Chang liver cells which has been initially incubated with or without different concentrations (15-240 μg/mL) of C. gratissimus infusion or the standard antioxidants (Gallic acid and ascorbic acid). C. gratissimus displayed significantly high scavenging activity and ferric reducing capacity following DPPH and FRAP assays, respectively. It had no cytotoxic effect on Chang liver cells. C. gratissimus also significantly elevated the level of hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase activities as well as suppressed the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in oxidative hepatic injury. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of the herbal tea revealed the presence of 8-prenylnaringenin, flavonol 3-O-D-galactoside, caffeine, spirasine I, hypericin, pheophorbide-a, and 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide. In silico oral toxicity prediction of the identified phytochemicals revealed no potential hepatotoxicity. Molecular docking revealed potent molecular interactions of the phytochemicals with SOD and catalase. The results suggest the hepatoprotective and antioxidative potentials of C. gratissimus herbal tea against oxidative hepatic injury."

      "abstract": "Neurological diseases affect the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves, nerve roots, autonomic nervous system, neuromuscular junctions, and muscles. Herbal medicine has long been used to cure these diseases. One of these plants is lavender, which is composed of various compounds, including terpenes, such as linalool, limonene, triterpenes, linalyl acetate, alcohols, ketones, polyphenols, coumarins, cineole, and flavonoids. In this review, the literature was searched using scientific search engines and databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, and PubMed) for papers published between 1982 and 2020 via keywords, including review, lavender, and neurological disorders. This plant exerts its healing effect on many diseases, such as anxiety and depression through an inhibitory effect on GABA. The anti-inflammatory effects of this plant have also been documented. It improves depression by regulating glutamate receptors and inhibiting calcium channels and serotonergic factors, such as SERT. Its antiepileptic mechanism is due to an increase in the inhibitory effect of GABA and potassium current and a decrease in sodium current. Therefore, many vegetable oils are also used in herbal medicine. In this review, the healing effect of lavender on several neurological disorders, including epilepsy, depression, anxiety, migraine, and Alzheimer's disease was investigated. All findings strongly support the traditional uses of lavender. More clinical studies are needed to investigate the effect of the plants' pharmacological active constituents on the treatment of life-threatening diseases in humans. The limitations of this study are the low quality and the limited number of clinical studies. Different administration methods of lavender are one of the limitations of this review."

Our study evaluated the use of lavender essential oil and sleep hygiene guidance on quality of life, sleep patterns and self-reported hot flashes in postmenopausal women with insomnia diagnosis. METHODS: This study is part of a larger experimental, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We included 35 postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of insomnia who were distributed in two groups: A Placebo group (sunflower oil) and an Aroma group (Lavandula angustifolia essential oil); both inhaled the oils before bedtime for 29 days. The groups received sleep hygiene guidelines and weekly follow-up. Validated questionnaires were used to assess the effect of the intervention, and a sleep diary was used to assess sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE) daily. Participants who complained of vasomotor symptoms at baseline kept a daily record of their frequency and intensity. RESULTS: All participants benefited in almost all domains of quality of life and in the self-assessed TST and SE. The Aroma group achieved a significant improvement in their overall quality of life score over time. No differences were observed in respect of the hot flashes record and daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: The aromatherapy intervention was effective in improving the overall quality of life in the Aroma group. Moreover, the sleep diary and sleep hygiene instructions helped all participants to, respectively, self-assess and improve their sleep patterns.",

The participants in the control and intervention group were administered nonopioid pain medication around the clock and opioids as needed after surgery. However, the intervention group also received a pre-packaged lavender essential oil inhaler. Total oral morphine equivalents (OME) were calculated for each participant to determine opioid usage. Although the total OME was similar for the groups overall, the total OME was slightly lower for THA patients that were enrolled in the intervention group (median 22.5) compared to THA patients that were enrolled in the control group (median 31.2). In the intervention group, 58% of participants reported that the lavender inhaler was a useful tool for pain management and 76% indicated they would continue to use the lavender inhaler after discharge.",

      "abstract": "Wound healing is a complex process involving blood cells, extracellular matrix, and parenchymal cells. Research on biomimetics in amphibian skin has identified the CW49 peptide from Odorrana grahami, which has been demonstrated to promote wound regeneration. Additionally, lavender essential oil exhibits anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. Given these considerations, we propose an innovative emulsion that combines the CW49 peptide with lavender oil. This novel formulation could serve as a potent topical treatment, potentially fostering the regeneration of damaged tissues and providing robust antibacterial protection for skin wounds. This study investigates the physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and in vitro regenerative capacity of the active components and the emulsion. The results show that the emulsion possesses appropriate rheological characteristics for topical application. Both the CW49 peptide and lavender oil exhibit high viability in human keratinocytes, indicating their biocompatibility. The emulsion induces hemolysis and platelet aggregation, an expected behavior for such topical treatments. Furthermore, the lavender-oil emulsion demonstrates antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Finally, the regenerative potential of the emulsion and its active components is confirmed in a 2D wound model using human keratinocytes. In conclusion, the formulated emulsion, which combines the CW49 peptide and lavender oil, shows great promise as a topical treatment for wound healing. Further research is needed to validate these findings in more advanced in vitro models and in vivo settings, potentially leading to improved wound-care management and novel therapeutic options for patients with skin injuries."

Seventy-three experimental group patients scheduled for colonoscopy at a training and research hospital in the west of Turkey in June to September 2022 and 72 control group patients were included in this randomized, controlled, prospective study. Minimal sedation (propofol 2-3 mg/kg) was applied in both groups. Lavender inhalation was applied to the experimental group, whereas the control group patients received nursing care (vital sign monitoring, prevention of complications, and rest). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Shortened General Comfort Questionnaire were used for pre- and postprocedural data collection. Median ages were 53.00 years (47.25-59.00) in the experimental group patients and 51.00 (44.00-59.5) in the control group. Although postprocedural state anxiety scores were lower in the experimental group compared with the control group, the difference was not statistically significant ( p = .069). The general postcolonoscopy comfort score was significantly higher in the experimental group compared with the control group ( p < .001). Trait anxiety scores also increased as the number of colonoscopies increased in both groups. We conclude that lavender oil inhalation, a simple and inexpensive intervention, increases patient comfort while exhibiting a positive, albeit statistically insignificant, effect on anxiety.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heavy metals (HMs) phytoremediation is a well-recognized protocol to remove toxic elements from the soil. As known, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance the plants' growth responses. The idea of the present study was to assay the response of lavender plants to HMs stress under AMF inoculation. We hypothesized that mycorrhiza will enhance the phytoremediation and simultaneously reduce the harmful effects of heavy HMs. So, lavender (Lavandula angustifolia L.) plants were inoculated with AMF (0 and 5 g Kg-1 soil) under Pb [150 and 225 mg kg-1 soil from Pb (NO3)2] and Ni [220 and 330 mg kg-1 soil from Ni (NO3)2] pollution, in the greenhouse conditions. The control treatment was plants not treated with AMF and HMs. Doing this, the root colonization, HMs uptake, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants pool, MDA, proline, total phenolics (TPC), flavonoids (TFC), anthocyanins, and essential oil (EO) components were evaluated. RESULTS: According to the findings, the AMF inoculation enhanced shoot and root Pb and Ni content, antioxidant enzymes activity, the total antioxidant activity by DPPH and FRAP methods, TPC, TFC, anthocyanins, and H2O2 content in the lavender plants subjected to Pb and Ni stress. Moreover, the highest (28.91%) and the least (15.81%) percentages of borneol were identified in the lavender plants subjected to AMF under 150 mg kg-1 of Pb and the control plants without AMF application, respectively. Furthermore, the top 1,8-cineole (12.75%) content was recorded in AMF-inoculated plants. CONCLUSIONS: The overall results verify that AMF inoculation can be a reliable methodology to enhance the phytoremediation of Pb and Ni by lavender plants while maintaining reliable growth potential. The treatments improved the main EO constituents content, especially under moderate HMs stress conditions. With more detailed studies, the results will be advisable for the extension section for the phytoremediation of polluted soils.",

Additionally, mice developed an anti-conflict effect and humans increased socially inclusive behaviors. Given the safety of oral lavender oil and the observed benefits, we administered daily lavender capsules to six chimpanzees who exhibited conflict-instigating behaviors in an effort to further decrease our already low levels of wounding. We compared the total number of wounds in 25 chimpanzees housed with the six lavender-treated chimpanzees in five different social groups (1) prior to administration of daily oral lavender capsules to (2) total wounds during daily oral lavender capsule treatment. We hypothesized that lavender therapy treatment would reduce overall wounding in the social groups. Surprisingly, overall wounding was higher during the lavender treatment period (p = 0.01), yet the percentage of wounds requiring treatment significantly decreased during the lavender therapy period (36% vs. 21%, p = 0.02)."

All the participants completed the sleep-related questionnaires and underwent two consecutive nights of PSG recordings, who had one night without aromatherapy and one night with one of the two aromas randomly assigned to them. RESULTS: Total of 53 participants were recruited for this study, 25 participants were in the SLEO group, and 28 were in the CLEO group. Baseline characteristics and sleep-related questionnaires were similar in both groups. Both SLEO and CLEO extended the total sleep time (TST) (Δ = 43.42 and 23.75 minutes, respectively) and sleep period time (SPT) (Δ = 38.86 and 24.07 minutes, respectively). The SLEO group further improved sleep efficiency and increased the amounts of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and decreased spontaneous arousals. However, there was no significant difference in PSG parameters between the SLEO and CLEO groups. CONCLUSION: Both SLEO and CLEO extended TST and SPT, with no significant differences between these two groups. These results warrant practical applications and merit future studies (Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT03933553).",

      "abstract": "Chronic wounds seriously affect the quality of life of the elderly, obese people, and diabetic patients. The excessive inflammatory response is a key driver of delayed chronic wound healing. Although lavender essential oil (EO [lav]) has been proven to have anti-inflammatory and accelerate wound curative effects, the specific molecular mechanism involved is still ambiguous. The results showed that the wounds treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) not only had delayed healing, but also the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and the inflammatory mediator protein, high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB-1), in the wound tissues were significantly increased. However, treatment of LPS-induced chronic wounds with EO (lav) accelerated wound healing and decreased IL-1β and HMGB-1 expression levels. It was further found that LPS induced macrophage pyroptosis to produce IL-1β. After treatment with EO (lav), the expression level of macrophage pyroptosis marker Gasdermin D (GSDMD) and pyroptosis-related cytotoxic effects were significantly reduced. Immunofluorescence results also directly indicate that EO (lav) can protect macrophages from LPS-induced pyroptosis. Moreover, EO (lav) can down-regulate expression levels of IL-1β, GSDMD, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in the caspase-11-related pyroptotic signaling pathway. This study demonstrates that EO (lav) can reduce proinflammatory factor production and ameliorate inflammatory response by inhibiting macrophage pyroptosis, which accelerates LPS-induced chronic wound healing.",

More recently, however, evaluation of the therapeutic effects of essential oils has expanded to include the oral route of administration, which increases the herb-drug interaction potential. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the herb-drug interaction potential of lavender essential oil and two of its primary phytoactive constituents, namely linalool and linalyl acetate. The metabolic stability of linalool and linalyl acetate was determined in human liver microsomes (HLM) and S9 fractions by quantitative analysis using UPLC-MS/MS system. Linalool was metabolically unstable in HLM and S9 fractions with an intrinsic clearance of 31.28 mL·min-1·kg-1, and 7.64 mL·min-1·kg-1, respectively. Interestingly, it was observed that linalyl acetate converted to linalool both in HLM and S9 fractions. Lavender oil showed weak inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 enzymes (IC50 12.0 and 21.5 µg/mL). Linalyl acetate inhibited CYP3A4 (IC50 4.75 µg/mL) while linalool did not show any inhibitory effect on any of the enzymes. The lavender oil and its constituents did not activate PXR to a considerable extent, and no activation of AhR was observed, suggesting a lack of potential to modify the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of conventional medications if used concurrently.",

Non-pharmacological drugs, including aromatherapy, can decrease these issues. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to summarise the effects of aromatherapy with Rosa damascene (RD) and lavender on the pain and anxiety of burn patients. A systematic search was performed on international electronic databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science, as well as on Iranian electronic databases such as Iranmedex and Scientific Information Database (SID) with keywords extracted from Medical Subject Headings such as \"Burns\", \"Pain\", \"Pain management\", \"Anxiety\", and \"Aromatherapy\" were performed from the earliest to November 1, 2022. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist assessed the quality of randomised control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies. STATA v.14 software was used to estimate pooled effect size. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 value. Random effect model and inverse-variance method using sample size, mean, and standard deviation changes were applied to determine standard mean differences (SMD). The confidence interval of 95% was considered to determine the confidence level. A total of 586 burn patients participated in six studies, including three RCT studies and three quasi-experimental studies. The results based on RCT studies showed RD significantly decreased the dressing pain average when compared to the control group (SMD: -1.61, 95%CI: -2.32 to -0.99, Z = 5.09, I2 : 66.2%, P < 0.001). Aromatherapy with lavender decreased the average pain in the interventional group more than in the control group (SMD: -1.78, 95%CI: -3.62 to 0.07, Z = 1.89, I2 : 97.2%, P = 0.06). Using aromatherapy with RD and lavender significantly decreased pain average in the interventional group than the control group (SMD: -1.68, 95%CI: -2.64 to -0.72, Z = 3.42, I2 : 94.2%, P = 0.001). The results showed RD significantly decreased the anxiety average in the interventional group than the control group (SMD: -2.49, 95%CI: -2.98 to -2.0, Z = 9.94, I2 : 51.6%, P < 0.001). Overall, this study showed that aromatherapy with RD decreased pain and anxiety of dressing procedures in burn patients. Although aromatherapy with lavender decreased pain in the patients, it was not statistically significant. More RCTs studies are required to be able to better judge the effects of aromatherapy with RD and lavender on the pain and anxiety of burn patients.",

Psychosocial disorders have been demonstrated to increase postoperative pain and opioid consumption by up to 50%. This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of Aromatherapy in controlling postoperative pain and opioid in anxious patients. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted on anxious patients who underwent primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty. After obtaining signed informed consent, each patient was asked to complete a PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) anxiety survey. Patients whose T score were >57.2 were randomized to either an active treatment (Lavender Peppermint Elequil® aromatab®) or a placebo Elequil®-aromatab® treatment. Demographics, pain, opioid consumption, PONV, and psychosocial surveys were collected on Postoperative Day POD1, POD2, POD7 and POD30. At the time of discharge and on POD30, each patient was asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire, and they were asked to complete an SF12 survey on POD30. Difference between means was assessed using absolute standardized mean differences. RESULTS: Sixty patients were included in the intend-to-treat analysis. Use of lavender and peppermint was associated with a decrease of 26% in pain (POD7; 0.46), 33% in opioid consumption (POD2; 0.42), and 48% in acetaminophen consumption (POD7; 0.54) and a 78% decrease in PONV (POD2; 0.44). Psychosocial scores decreased following surgery (p=0.001). Overall satisfaction ratings at discharge were similar, as were functional recovery scores. DISCUSSION: Our data provides evidence that in patients with preoperative anxiety, lavender and peppermint aromas decreases postoperative pain and opioid requirement compared to placebo. Additional research is required to conform our data. CONCLUSION: This randomized placebo control study provides evidence of the usefulness of inhalation of lavender and peppermint aromas in patients undergoing primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty."

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of topical lavender essential oils in decreasing the instance of burnout in frontline ICU health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A predesign and postdesign evidence-based practice project was conducted to evaluate the implications of an 8-week topical lavender oil intervention on health care worker burnout. The Maslach Burnout Inventory, including subscales of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment, was administered before and after the intervention. Health care workers' compliance and satisfaction with the intervention were also measured. RESULTS: Thirty-four ICU health care workers participated. Results showed significant improvements in the personal accomplishment subscale (mean [SD], 3.86 [0.81] before vs 4.14 [1.01] after intervention; P = .04). Improvements in depersonalization were not significant. Most participants were satisfied (n = 23 [67.6%]) and compliant (n = 23 [67.6%]) with the intervention.

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.) essential oil is renowned for its use in the treatment of insomnia and mental disorder diseases in folk medicine. Previous pharmacological studies have also shown that lavender essential oil displays sedative and hypnotic activities. However, the active ingredients and mechanism of lavender essential oil for sleep-improving effect remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study investigates whether inhalation of different fractions of lavender essential oil can attenuate the sleep disturbances induced by combined anxiety and caffeine and explores the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molecular distillation was applied to separate lavender essential oil into fractions containing different chemical components, and GC-MS was used to analyze the volatile compounds of lavender essential oil and its fractions. The elevated plus maze test, pentobarbital-induced sleep test, and neurotransmitters enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were conducted to evaluate the anxiolytic and hypnotic effects of lavender essential oil and its fractions on mice suffering from sleep disorders. RESULTS: The results of behavioral tests indicated that lavender essential oil and its fractions (3%, v/v) exerted an ameliorating effect on sleep disturbances induced by anxiety and caffeine. The light fraction and heavy fractions exhibited complementary chemical composition, with the former enriched in linalool and trans-β-ocimene and the latter in linalyl acetate, lavandulyl acetate, trans-caryophyllene, etc. The light fraction contributed more to sleep maintenance, and the heavy fraction performed better at sleep initiation. The neurobiological parameters elucidated that the mechanism of lavender essential oil for sleep-improving was multifaceted, related to the GABAergic system, cholinergic system, histaminergic system, and monoamines in the limbic system. The heavy fraction shared a similar mechanism with the lavender essential oil, while the light fraction did not actively participate in the cholinergic system, histaminergic system, and dopaminergic system. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results demonstrated that different fractions of lavender essential oil played different roles in ameliorating sleep disorders, and this may be credited to their compositional differences and the complicated interactions with the central nervous system. The results are informative for future investigations on the molecular level mechanisms and provide guidance for appropriate applications of lavender essential oil.",

The primary aim of the study was to determine if nasal inhaler aromatherapy, utilizing a blend of rosemary and lavender essential oils, could be a useful strategy to reduce testing anxiety in students. METHODS: This study recruited first trimester chiropractic students enrolled in both Neuroanatomy I and Biochemistry I. A randomized crossover design was utilized over 2 study days during final exams, with a 2-day wash-out period. Participants were randomly assigned into groups based on results of test anxiety analysis. On each day, students were given a nasal inhaler with either an aromatherapy blend of lavender and rosemary essential oils or distilled water as the control. Students completed pretest surveys and posttest surveys to rate their anxiety levels. Paired sample t-tests were performed to determine group differences in test anxiety. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Forty-five students were randomly assigned into the study, whereas only 38 completed per-protocol. Between group comparisons showed no statistically significant difference between change in anxiety scores between aromatherapy and control for both intention-to-treat (p =.10) and per-protocol (p =.07). CONCLUSION: Use of personal inhalers and aromatherapy diffusers were not shown to reduce test anxiety in a chiropractic population under high-stakes examination.

(LEO) on the growth performance, tissue histoarchitecture, and fatty acid profile in breast muscles, as well as blood biochemistry and immune expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines of broiler chickens. A total of 200 three-day-old broiler chickens (average body weight 101.3 ± 0.24 g) were assigned to a completely randomized design consisting of four dietary treatments (n = 50 per treatment, each replicate consisting of 10 birds) that included lavender essential oil at concentrations of 0 (control group), 200, 400, and 600 mg Kg−1 diet. The experiment lasted for 35 days. The results revealed that supplementation of lavender essential oil at 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg in broiler diets had no effect (p > 0.05) on the growth performance throughout the experimental periods (3−10, 11−23, and 24−35 days of age). According to the broken line regression model, the optimal level for dietary LEO addition was the 460 mg kg−1 diet based on the total body weight gain and feed conversion ratio results. The diets supplemented with lavender essential oil had no effect (p > 0.05) on the percentages of carcass yield or internal organs. Dietary addition of LEO significantly increased the percentages of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA (n-3), omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6), and the n-3/n-6 ratio (p < 0.05) in the breast muscles of chickens in a level-dependent manner. The blood concentration of alanine aminotransferase was significantly increased in lavender essential oil at 600 mg kg−1 compared with other treatments. The dietary addition of LEO at 200, 400, and 600 mg kg−1 significantly reduced the malondialdehyde level. Still, they significantly increased the serum enzyme activities of total antioxidant capacity, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine (interleukine-1 beta and interferon γ) compared with the unsupplemented group. The LEO-supplemented groups showed normal liver histomorphology as in the control group. However, the immunoexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor β was significantly increased by increasing the level of LEO. It can be concluded that lavender essential oil can be included in broiler chicken diets up to 460 mg kg −1 with no positive effect on the bird’s growth. It can improve the antioxidant capacity and enrich the breast muscles with PUFA. An increased level of supplementation (600 mg kg−1) increased the inflammatory responses in broiler chickens."

This study was conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study to investigate the effect of abdominal massage applied with lavender and ginger oil on constipation for elderly individuals. METHODS: The study examined a total of 40 elderly individuals who lived in a nursing home and suffered from constipation. Elderly individuals in the intervention group underwent 15 min of aromatherapy massage for 5 weekdays per week for 4 weeks. No intervention was conducted for individuals in the control group. RESULTS: While the Bristol Stool Chart and the Constipation Severity Scale scores were similar in the intervention and control groups of elderly individuals at the first follow-up (p > 0.05), in the second and fourth week after the application, scores in the Bristol Stool Chart increased significantly and scores in the Constipation Severity Scale decreased significantly in the intervention group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It was determined that aromatherapy massage applied to elderly individuals experiencing constipation softened stool consistency, decreased constipation severity, and reduced symptoms associated with constipation.",

The aim of this research is to consider the impact of lavender fragrance on anxiety and hemodynamics status before the septorhinoplasty and rhinoplasty. DESIGN: Parallel randomized control trial. METHODS: This research was done by testing thirty-four candidates who were about to have the surgery in two groups of lavender (intervention) and control. The anxiety before and after surgery was examined by the Speilberger State Anxiety Inventory questionnaire and the hemodynamics status. For the analysis, the T- Test, Mann Whitney Test and the χ2 Test were used. FINDINGS: The demographic features of the two groups were similar. Anxiety after the experiment was meaningful. The obvious anxiety in the lavender category was 25.8% and the controlled group had that decreased to 1.8%. The latent anxiety was reduced by 24.3% in the lavender group and increased by 8% in the controlled group. The systolic, diastolic and the heart rate after the intervention was less in the lavender group. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the ease of the inhalation of lavender and the lack of any report for the existence of any kind of side-effects for the prevention of anxiety during nose surgeries, it can be suggested that this approach can be effective for the controlling of the consistency of the patients' hemodynamics.",

METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted with three groups. Pregnant women participating in the study were randomly divided into control group (n=40), lavender essence inhalation group (n=44) and lavender essence massage (n=37) groups. The applications were divided in three for each phase in the first stage of labor (early, active and transition). Thereafter sacral compression and circular massage were applied for 15 minutes on the lower back (waist) region of the participants by using 2 drops of lavender oil in each phase of labor; 2 drops of lavender oil were dripped onto the palms of the participants in the inhalation group by the researcher and they were asked to inhale it for 3 minutes. Research data were collected using Personal Information Form (PIF), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Postpartum Assessment of Women Survey (PAWS). RESULTS: The results of the research revealed that the labor pain perceived by the women who were applied inhalation and massage therapy using lavender essential oil were milder compared to the control group (p<0.05). Another finding of the research revealed that the lavender oil inhalation gave the best results in the latent phase, however the massage therapy with lavender oil was more effective in the active and transition phases. CONCLUSION: Inhalation and massage therapy applied using lavender essential oil contributed to the alleviation of perceived labor pain. For this reason, massage therapy and inhalation applications using lavender oil are recommended to be applied by midwives as a complementary method to adapt to labor pain during delivery.",

Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been recommended to control this complication. Lavender is one of the plants considered by Persian Medicine (PM) and recommended by scholars of past centuries in the treatment of neurological diseases. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of lavender capsule on improving fatigue symptoms in MS patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a double-blind, controlled trial, using a computer block randomization approach, 48 confirmed MS patients with eligibility criteria of being 18 years or older, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) ≥25, relapsing-remitting MS patients, EDSS ≤6, not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and not suffering from other diseases that cause fatigue, were randomized to receive capsules containing 600mg of lavender flowers as the intervention group or capsules containing 600mg cornstarch as the control group. Patients were randomized after completing the MFIS and were asked to take one capsule three times daily for 60 days. The MFIS again checked to assess the impact of two interventions. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess the impact of two interventions. RESULTS: 24 patients included in each group. The mean (standard deviation) of MFIS was 40.56 (7.63) in the intervention and 41.43 (7.89) in the control groups (p=0.706) before the intervention. However, there was a significant reduction (p0.001˂) in the intervention group, 7.04 (4.91) compared to the control group, 38.17 (9.78) after the intervention. CONCLUSION: In comparison to cornstarch capsules, consuming the capsules of lavender flowers decreased the MFIS in MS patients.",

      "abstract": "Plant growth regulators can affect the primary and secondary metabolites of various plant species. However, the effect of paclobutrazol (PBZ) on the composition of lavender oil, especially related to the terpenoid pathway, is still unclear in literatures. In this study, the effect of PBZ as a foliar spray (0.200, 400 and 600 ppm) on the vegetative growth, phytochemical content, and both antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of lavender oil were investigated. The results indicated that all examined PBZ treatments led to a significant (p ≤ 0.05) decrease in growth parameters compared to the untreated plants. Meanwhile, the yield of essential oil was significantly decreased by the treatment of PBZ at 200 ppm compared to the control. In contrast, applied-PBZ significantly enhanced the chlorophyll content and displayed a marked change in the composition of the essential oil. This change included an obvious and significant increase in 3-carene, eucalyptol, γ-terpinene, α-pinocarvone, caryophyllene, β-vetivenene, β-santalol, ledol, geranyl isovalerate, farnesol, caryophyllene oxide, and phytol percentage. Generally, the highest significant values were achieved by the treatment of 400 ppm compared to the other treatments. Furthermore, this treatment showed the highest free radical scavenging activity against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) by 13% over the control. Additionally, to determine the antimicrobial activities of the extracted oil, each treatment was examined against two strains of Gram positive bacteria (S. aureus and B. cereus), two strains of Gram negative bacteria (S. enteritidis and E. coli), and two fungal species (C. albicans and A. niger) represent the yeast modal and filamentous fungus, respectively. The findings demonstrated that all examined species were more sensitive to the oil that was extracted from lavender plants, treated with 400 ppm PBZ, compared to the other concentrations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs), as one of the largest families of TFs, are essential regulators of plant terpenoid biosynthesis and response to stresses. Lavender has more than 75 volatile terpenoids, yet few TFs have been identified to be involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis. RESULTS: Based on RNA-Seq, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and transgenic technology, this study characterized the stress-responsive transcription factor LaMYC4 regulates terpenoid biosynthesis. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment increased volatile terpenoid emission, and the differentially expressed gene LaMYC4 was isolated. LaMYC4 expression level was higher in leaf than in other tissues. The expression of LaMYC4 decreased during flower development. The promoter of LaMYC4 contained hormone and stress-responsive regulatory elements and was responsive to various treatments, including UV, MeJA treatment, drought, low temperature, Pseudomonas syringae infection, and NaCl treatment. LaMYC4 overexpression increased the levels of sesquiterpenoids, including caryophyllenes, in Arabidopsis and tobacco plants. Furthermore, the expression of crucial node genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis and glandular trichome number and size increased in transgenic tobacco. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that the stress-responsive MYC TF LaMYC4 from 'Jingxun 2' lavender regulates volatile terpenoid synthesis. This study is the first to describe the cloning of LaMYC4, and the results help understand the role of LaMYC4 in terpenoid biosynthesis.",

The anti-inflammatory activity of LO (JAK2/STAT3) was evaluated by immunocytochemical assay. Likewise, the p-ERK/ERK level was measured by western blotting. RESULTS: Compared with only the OGD-induced injury model, cell survival increased after treatment with LO. Our results showed that 100 μg/ml of LO significantly decreased the expression of Jak2/Stat3 and the apoptotic activity 72 hr after reperfusion compared with the control group. Likewise, significant increases were observed in p-ERK/ERK in LO-treated groups.

RESULTS: The levels of tumour necrosis factor-α (BALF: 64%, serum: 59%), interleukin (IL)-1β (BALF: 63%, serum: 66%) and IL-6 (BALF: 54%, serum: 59%), and nitrite (40%) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (51%), and the level of myeloperoxidase (66%) and malondialdehyde (59%), and cleaved-caspase 3 (84%) and Bax expression (74%) induced by CLP were decreased when given Lav. Additionally, the level of superoxide dismutase (211%) and glutathione (139%), and the expression of Bcl-2 (980%) induced by CLP were increased when given Lav. The increased p-nuclear factor (NF)-κB/NF-κB (72%) and p-inhibitor of κBα (IκBα)/IκBα (77%) induced by CLP could be reversed by Lav. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Lav pre-treatment might protect rats from sepsis-induced ALI via deactivation of the NF-κB pathway. Our research demonstrated the regulatory mechanisms of Lav in sepsis-induced ALI and can provide a theoretical basis for the use of Lav in the treatment of sepsis-induced ALI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interstitial cystitis (IC) has a chronic chemical irritation and inflammation of non-bacterial origin in the bladder wall leading to various severe symptoms. There is evidence that chronic inflammation is significantly associated with abnormal urothelial barrier function, epithelial dysfunction. This is the underlying cause of urothelial apoptosis and sterile inflammation. METHOD: The anti-inflammatory effects of lavender and eucalyptus essential oils (EOs) and their main components (linalool and eucalyptol) were investigated in the T24 human bladder epithelial cell line on TNFα stimulated inflammation, at 3 types of treatment schedule. The mRNA of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8) were measured by Real Time PCR. Human IL-8 ELISA measurement was performed as well at 3 types of treatment schedule. The effects of lavender and eucalyptus EOs and their main components were compared to the response to NFκB inhibitor ACHP (2-amino-6-[2-(cyclopropylmethoxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl]-4-(4-piperidinyl)-3-pyridinecarbonitrile). RESULT: There is no significant difference statistically, but measurements show that lavender EOs are more effective than eucalyptus EO. Long time treatment (24 h) of both lavender EO and linalool showed higher effect in decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression than ACHP inhibitor following TNFα pre-treatment. Moreover, both lavender EOs were found to be significantly more effective in decreasing IL-8 secretion of T24 cells after TNFα pre-treatment compared to the ACHP NFκB-inhibitor. CONCLUSION: The lavender EOs may be suitable for use as an adjunct to intravesical therapy of IC. Their anti-inflammatory effect could well complement glycosaminoglycan-regenerative therapy in the urinary bladder after appropriate pharmaceutical formulation.",

The aim of this research was to integrate and synthesize relevant scientific evidence about the effect of lavender on cancer complications. METHODS: A systematic review of the international literature was undertaken. The search process encompassed four databases of PubMed [including MEDLINE], Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane library without time and language limits. All types of interventional studies examining the effects of lavender on cancer complications were included in data analysis and research synthesis. Relevant data were obtained from eligible studies after quality appraisal using appropriate methodological tools. Given that meta-analysis could not performed, the review findings were synthesized narratively. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in this review with a total of 838 patients. Nine studies used a randomized controlled trial design and the majority of them were conducted on patients with multiple types of cancer. Lavender was often used as inhalation aromatherapy. In the majority of the included studies, lavender was significantly effective in the reduction of anxiety and pain, and improved sleep quality and vital signs. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of lavender in mitigating cancer complications. Healthcare providers are suggested to use lavender in patient care along with other healthcare interventions to relieve cancer complications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lavender is considered as one of the medicinal plants to manage stress. Although many preliminary studies evaluated the effect of lavender on individuals' stress level, to the best of our knowledge, we did not find a study that summarizes the results. Therefore, the present study aimed to estimate the Pooled effect of lavender on the stress level of individuals using systematic review and meta-analysis. METHOD: A systematic literature review based on PRISMA 2020 was performed on the SID, MagIran, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS) databases, and Google Scholar motor engine using related MeSH/Emtree and ‎Free Text words,‎ including \"Lavender*\", \"Lavandula*\", \"Stress*\", \"Stress Disorders, Traumatic\", and \"Stress, Psychological\" with no time limitation until August 2021: We also searched two Iranain free local resourses including MagIran https://www.magiran.com and Scientific Information Database (SID) https://www.sid.ir. The quality assessment of studies was performed using JBI checklist. Heterogeneity among studies was quantified using I2 index and Random Effects model was used to combine the data and perform the meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the initial search, 1520 articles were found. After excluding the irrelevant studies, finally, 21 articles with a sample size of 791 in the intervention group and 804 in the control group were included in the meta-analysis. As a result of combining the studies, stress score after using lavender in the intervention group showed a significant decrease of 0.63 ± 0.13 (95% CI) more than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The results of subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest standardized mean difference (SMD) before and after the intervention in the intervention group compared to the control group was related to L. angustifolia species with 0.73 ± 0.22, student groups with 2.27 ± 1.34, and diagnostic tool of Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) with 0.82 ± 0.42, indicating that the difference between the groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The pooled estimation of this systematic reiew and meta-analysis revealed that lavender significantly reduces individuals' stress. Therefore, it seems that the use of lavender can be considered as a part of a stress management programs, especially in student groups.",

It is also one of the most frequent complaints in primary healthcare centers. Lavender is called \"the broom of the brain\" in different oriental traditional medicines. It is one of the most used plants for patients with sleep disorders. This study reviews what is currently known about the use of lavender for sleep disorders in patients with different diseases, from cancers and end-stage renal disease to neurological-psychiatric diseases (e.g., depression, dementia, and autism), respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic diseases. Additionally, its most used administration route is the inhalation of its essential oil (i.e., aromatherapy) alone or in combination by massage. Some limitations of the reviewed literature were discussed briefly. Overall, this critical review provides promising evidence of the lavender efficacy for sleep disorders in a wide variety of populations and diseases. However, further clinical studies with robust design and longer durations of intervention are necessary for more evidence-based judgment on its effect on sleep problems and to investigate its mechanism of action.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Although a number of studies have shown that lavender administered via inhalation can decrease the invasive pain and anxiety experienced by hemodialysis (HD) patients during cannulation, the evaluation has mostly been on the short-term effectiveness of lavender oil. Also, no study has evaluated the effects of lavender on comfort level. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the long-term effectiveness of lavender oil, when administered via an inhaler during HD sessions, on a patient's experience of invasive pain, anxiety, and comfort during access to the fistula. DESIGN: The research team designed a prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. SETTING: The study took place in an HD unit of a public hospital in Kirklareli, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 24 patients receiving HD in the unit between January and March 2021. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Pure lavender essence was diluted with sweet almond oil at a ratio of 1:10. Before the cannulation procedure at 12 HD sessions, three drops of a 1:10 mixture were placed on sterile gauze and held at a distance of about 10 cm from the participant's nose to ensure its inhalation before the fistula puncture with the needle. No extra procedure was performed for the control group. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed a visual analogue scale (VAS) right after puncture of the fistula during each HD session. The STAI and HD Comfort Scale were scored at baseline prior to the first HD session and postintervention at the twelfth HD session. RESULTS: The VAS (P < .001) and state anxiety scores (P = .027) were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group at all time points, except at baseline. The comfort scale in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Lavender aromatherapy could be a good option for reducing the pain, anxiety, and discomfort level of HD patients.",

Recent efforts aim on nature-friendly sustainable technologies of wood protection to replace classical synthetic agents having usually negative impact on many non-target organisms including man. This research investigated the biocidal effectiveness of lavender oil (LO) in protecting the Norway spruce (Picea abies) wood against the termites Reticulitermes flavipes and the brown-rot fungus Rhodonia placenta. Following, selected physical characteristics of spruce wood treated with LO were evaluated: colour changes, roughness, surface wetting with water and surface free energy (SFE). Experiments showed that LO increased the resistance of spruce wood to termites nearly to the level of its treatment with commercial biocide based on trivalent boron and quaternary ammonium salt. The additional hydrophobic treatment of wood ensured its full termite-resistance even after artificial weathering in Xenotest and leaching in water according to EN 84, respectively. It shows a high potential of LO to protect wood against termites. Adversely, the effectiveness of 5% LO against rot was not sufficient. The colour of the oil-treated wood was preserved, its roughness increased slightly, and wetting and SFE led to a positive change, improving the adhesion of potentially applied coatings or adhesives for exterior exposures."

Data on the effect of combined auricular acupuncture and lavender oil aromatherapy in patients undergoing cardiovascular interventions with the use of local anesthesia or under conscious sedation are sparse. The authors sought to evaluate the efficacy of auricular acupuncture and lavender oil aromatherapy in reducing preinterventional anxiety in cardiovascular patients. Materials and Methods: Data of 80 consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography (n = 56) with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 9) and right heart catheterization (n = 6), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (n = 17) and percutaneous mitral valve repair (MitraClip; n = 2) were analyzed. Patients were prospectively randomized to receive either preinterventional auricular acupuncture and lavender oil (Lavandula angustifolia) aromatherapy (verum group, n = 39) or combined sham auricular acupuncture and placebo oil aromatherapy (placebo group, n = 41). For the verum group bilateral auricular acupuncture was performed at the \"relaxation point.\" State anxiety and blood pressure were assessed before and at 30 min after acupuncture and presternal oil application. State anxiety was defined as primary outcome measure and assessed using the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for Adults form Y6. Intervention-specific anxiety was assessed by a 10-point numerical rating scale, and perceived treatment success by a single dichotomous question. Clinical blood pressure was further assessed. Results: After the intervention, the verum group had significantly decreased anxiety on the STAI compared with the placebo group (Δ = -4.18; 95% confidence interval = -8.31 to -0.05; p = 0.047). Significantly more patients reported subjective treatment success in the verum group (87.2%) than in the placebo group (65.9%, p = 0.035). No significant differences were observed regarding intervention-specific anxiety and blood pressure between the two groups. No serious adverse events occurred in any group. Conclusions: Combined auricular acupuncture and lavender oil aromatherapy can decrease preinterventional anxiety in cardiovascular patients and requires further investigation.

Heterogeneity of the studies was investigated using the I-squared test (I2). Three out of the 292 obtained studies entered the meta-analysis. The results indicated that sleep quality in the group receiving lavender improved compared to the control group, (SMD = -0.61; 95% CI: -1.07 to -015 p = 0.01) whereas the heterogeneity was higher. (I2 = 75%; Tau2 = 012; Chi2 = 7.905, p = 0.02). According to the results of this systematic review, use of lavender can improve postpartum maternal sleep quality. However, further randomized controlled trials using identical methodology, larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed."

      "abstract": "Background and aims Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered a safe, effective, and significant treatment in patients suffering from a major depressive disorder. Anxiety caused by this invasive treatment may impose several side effects on patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of aromatherapy with inhaled lavender essential oil and breathing exercises on ECT-related anxiety in depressed patients. Methods In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 90 depressed patients were selected and divided into three groups: aromatherapy, breathing exercise, and routine care using a random allocation method. Before undergoing ECT, the aromatherapy group was exposed to the inhaled lavender essential oil (n = 30), the breathing exercise group performed the breathing exercises (n = 30), and the routine care group received routine care (n = 30). Before (20 min) and after the intervention (30 min later), patients' anxiety was assessed using Beck Anxiety Inventory. Results After the intervention, the results revealed that anxiety score changes were statistically significant among the three groups (p < 0.001). In addition, it was found that the patients' mean anxiety scores significantly decreased in the aromatherapy and breathing exercise groups compared to with the pre-intervention scores (p < 0.001). Conclusion Aromatherapy with inhaled lavender essential oil and breathing exercises can be considered by clinical nurses as simple, applicable, and effective interventions to reduce ECT-related anxiety in depressed patients.",

      "abstract": "Background: To reduce pain and anxiety associated with interventional pain procedures, sedation is often used, with benzodiazepines, opioids, and propofol the most commonly used classes of drugs for sedation. However, patient coherence and ability to communicate procedural pain and abnormal sensations help prevent adverse outcomes. Therefore, discovering alternative therapies to mitigate the anxiety and pain associated with these procedures and to minimize risk is important. The aim of our study was to investigate whether lavender has an effect on pain and anxiety associated with lumbar epidural steroid injections and lumbar medial branch blocks. Methods: In this randomized controlled study, 54 subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups, and 46 patients were included in the final analysis: experimental lavender group (n=17), control almond oil group (n=15), and placebo sterile water group (n=14). Patients wore a mask infused with either lavender, almond oil, or water for 5 minutes prior to and during their procedure. Patients rated their anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory prior to and after the procedure based on how they felt during the procedure. Patients rated their pain according to the numerical rating scale. Outcome measures were a comparison of pain among the 3 groups and a comparison of the change in anxiety before and after the procedure among the 3 groups. Results: The lavender group demonstrated the highest mean change in anxiety scores (9.9) compared to almond oil (5.3) and water (3.6) preprocedurally vs postprocedurally. The lavender group also reported the lowest mean pain level (3.8) compared to almond oil (5.6) and water (5.6). However, none of the differences between groups showed statistical significance at the P<0.05 level. Conclusion: Lavender may have a clinically beneficial effect on anxiety levels and pain reduction."

Preliminary data suggest that decreasing this anxiety might lead to improved outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lavender aromatherapy (LA) reduces anxiety during an IUI procedure. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of women undergoing IUI at a hospital-based fertility clinic. The intervention and comparison were the use of LA vs water. Measurements were the change in anxiety level during an IUI procedure, with secondary assessment of pain scores, patient satisfaction, and pregnancy rates. RESULTS: In total, 67 women were screened, and 62 women randomly assigned to either placebo (n = 31) or LA (n = 31). No differences were observed in baseline demographic characteristics or visual analog scores for anxiety before IUI (mean [95% CI], 33.9 [25.2 to 45.6] mm vs 41.0 [33.0 to 49.0] mm) in the LA and placebo groups. However, a statistically significant change in anxiety was observed after LA inhalation during the procedure (mean [95% CI], -11.2 [-19.1 to -3.2]) compared with placebo (mean [95% CI], 1.3 [-5.6 to 8.2]; P = .02). No significant difference was observed in pain during IUI in the LA group vs placebo group. Patient satisfaction was high, with 93% of respondents in the LA group satisfied with the aromatherapy during their procedure. Additionally, 76% of participants who received placebo reported that they would prefer to use LA during their IUI. No statistically significant difference was detected in pregnancy rates between the 2 groups: 19.4% with LA vs 9.7% with placebo (P = .47). CONCLUSION: LA reduced anxiety and was preferred by women during IUI fertility treatments."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common Gram-negative bacterium associated with nosocomial respiratory infections. Lavender essential oil is mainly used in aromatherapy, but it has several pharmacological and therapeutic properties. Furthermore, it possesses antifungal and antibacterial activities. The anti-inflammatory activity of essential oils may depend on the composition and the ratio of the compounds. The constitution of the essential oils extracted from the different stages of flowering period varies, which makes it plausible that the collection time of the flowers influences the anti-inflammatory effects. Different types of essential oils reduce inflammation acting similarly by modulating the activity and action of the NFκB signalling pathway, which is the major regulator of the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: Lavender essential oils were distilled from lavender plant cultivated in Hungary and the flowers were harvested at the beginning and at the end of flowering period. The experiments were carried out on THP-1 human monocyte/macrophage cell line as in vitro cell culture model for monitoring the effects of lavender essential oils and the main compound linalool on P. aeruginosa LPS stimulated inflammation. The mRNA and protein levels of four pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8 and TNFα were determined by Real Time PCR and ELISA measurements. The effects of essential oils were compared to the response to two NFκB inhibitors, luteolin and ACHP. RESULTS: Linalool and lavender essential oil extracted from plants at the beginning of flowering period were successful in decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production following LPS pretreatment. In case of IL-8 and IL-1β lavender oil showed stronger effect compared to linalool and both of them acted similarly to NFκB inhibitors. Pretreatments with linalool and lavender essential oil/beginning of flowering period prevented pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared to LPS treatment alone. Although lavender essential oil/end of flowering period decreased IL-6, IL-1β and IL-8 mRNA expression in case of LPS pretreatment, it was not capable to reduce cytokine secretion. CONCLUSION: Based on our results it has been proven that lavender essential oil extracted at the beginning of flowering period is a potent inhibitor of the synthesis of four pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-β and TNFα of THP-1 cells. This supports the relevance of the collection of the lavender flowers from early blooming period for essential oil production and for the utilization as an anti-inflammatory treatment.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study assessed the effects of massage therapy using 5% lavender oil on the severity of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and the quality of life (QoL) of patients on hemodialysis (HD). DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a randomized placebo-controlled study with a pretest-posttest design. This study was conducted from January 30, 2019, to May 6, 2019, at HD centers in Turkey, and it includes 58 participants-31 study patients and 27 controls. Data were collected using patient identification form, RLS severity rating scale, Kidney Disease Quality of Life Scale (KDQOLTM -36) and patient follow-up charts. As per the massage therapy protocol, the patients in the study and control groups received massage therapy with lavender oil and baby oil, respectively. FINDINGS: RLS severity significantly decreased in all follow-up weeks in the study group and in the first, second, and third follow-up weeks in the control group. There were significant differences between the groups in terms of KDQOLTM -36 subscales and total scores at the initial and final follow-ups. CONCLUSION: In HD patients, massage with lavender oil lessened the severity of RLS and improved the QoL. Accordingly, this therapy can be recommended to HD patients. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Massage therapy during HD sessions is easy, inexpensive, and patient-friendly with no side effects. It is known to reduce symptoms and enable the patients to easily perform daily activities of living. Massage therapy with lavender oil is effective and can be easily applied to patients with RLS by nurses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered under the Clinical Trials protocol registration system (NCT04630470) upon completion.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The recent evidence suggested substantial anxiolytic efficacy of lavender. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of lavender for anxiety, depression, and physiological parameters and to elucidate the differential effects of lavender on anxiety and depression by study characteristics. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases for randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of lavender on anxiety, depression, or physiological parameters in humans. We assessed the risk of bias within studies with the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials. We used random effect model to estimate the average effect and computed bias-corrected standardized mean difference as effect size metric, Hedges' ĝ for all outcomes. RESULTS: Lavender was superior to placebo or no treatment in reducing anxiety (Hedges' ĝ = -0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.90 to -0.55, p value <.001), depression (Hedges' ĝ = -0.43, 95% CI, -0.59 to -0.27, p value <.001), and systolic blood pressure (Hedges' ĝ = -0.23, 95% CI, -0.41to -0.05, p value = .01). The moderator analysis by meta-regression indicated that route of administration accounted 6.5% (p value = .187) for the heterogeneity in anxiolytic effects, sessions of treatment accounted 13.2% (p value = .055), and participants' health state accounted 8.9% (p value = .131) for the variance in anxiolytic effects. CONCLUSION: Lavender aromatherapy showed substantial effect in reducing anxiety and depression, and sessions of administration increased the anxiolytic effects. The effects on physiological parameters showed small with inconsistent significances and randomized controlled trials on the effect of lavender on depression were scarce. Future trials on depression and physiological parameters are recommended, and increasing the sessions of administration is recommended.",

People experience some degree of stress and anxiety before and during examinations. This study aimed to investigate the effect of blended aromatherapy using lavender and damask rose oils on the test anxiety of nursing students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was a single-blinded clinical trial study. Seventy nursing students were selected and randomly assigned to two experimental and sham groups. For the experimental group, seven droplets of lavender, 10%, and three droplets of damask rose oil, 10%, and for the sham group, ten droplets of sesame oil were poured on a nonabsorbent pad which was placed within a 20-cm distance from the students' noses on their chairs' handles. The data were collected by using a two-part questionnaire including demographic information and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 1, before, 15 min after the intervention, and immediately at the end of the test. Data were analyzed using descriptive (frequency, mean, and standard deviation) and inferential (independent t-test, ANOVA with repeated measure, Fisher's exact test, and least significant difference post hoc test) statistics. RESULTS: It was found that no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, the number of credits, Semester Grade Point Average and, gender, place of residence and marital status and the two groups were almost identical in regard of the above variables (P > 0.05). State anxiety mean scores of the experimental group were lower than the mean scores of the sham group, 15 min after the intervention and at the end of the test, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Blended aromatherapy is effective in improving the test anxiety of nursing students. Therefore, it can be used as a therapeutic approach to reduce test anxiety."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: hemodialysis patients' daily use of medications is essential for the disease management. One of the causes of medication non-adherence is that they forget to take medications, and non-adherence to treatment following memory loss is a common problem in patients on hemodialysis. OBJECTIVE: the current study aimed to compare the effects of Lavender, Rosemary, and Orange essential oils on memory problems (both retrospective and prospective aspects of memory) and medication adherence in hemodialysis patients. DESIGN: this study was a parallel randomized controlled trial. SETTING: the two main hemodialysis centers in Kerman, southeastern Iran. PARTICIPANTS: eighty-six patients under chronic hemodialysis were randomly allocated into four groups (Lavender, Rosemary, Orange, and control) by simple randomization method. INTERVENTIONS: The samples of the intervention group, in addition to routine care, received Lavender or Rosemary or Orange essential oils three times a week for a month. A gauze containing with five drops of the essential oil was placed at a distance of 10 cm from the patient's nose one hour after hemodialysis, and the patient was asked to inhale it for 30 min. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: retrospective and prospective memory, and medication adherence were assessed before, immediately and one month after the intervention. RESULTS: prospective memory problems in Lavender, Rosemary and Orange groups did not change significantly over time (P > 0.05). Prospective memory problems in the control group had a significant increase (P = 0.002). No significant difference was found in prospective memory problems between the four groups (P > 0.05). Retrospective memory problems in the Lavender and Rosemary groups decreased significantly over time (P <0.05). The decreasing retrospective memory problems in the Orange and control groups were not statistically significant over time (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in retrospective memory problems between the four groups (P > 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the four groups in medication adherence score during the study (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: aromatherapy with Lavender or Rosemary can reduce some memory problems in hemodialysis patients. However, the results of this study could not justify the effect of aromatherapy on the rate of medication adherence in patients on hemodialysis, so further studies are required.

There is, however, little research to compare the impact of them over each other. The aim of current study was to compare the effect of aromatherapy with lavender and damask rose on sleep quality in patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in Guilan Province, Iran, in 2017-2018. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial (RCT) study, 97 patients undergoing CABG were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. In the intervention groups, the patients were asked by the researcher to inhale the lavender or damask rose randomly every night for 5 consecutive nights at 22:00. The control group received routine nursing care in compliance with the hospital procedure. Data were obtained by demographic-clinical and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires. To analyze the data, chi-square test, t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon test were used. RESULTS: During the 5-night intervention period, despite a relative improvement of sleep quality in intervention groups compared to the control group, none of the two aromatherapies had a statistically significant effect on any of delayed sleep (P = 0.514), sleep duration (P = 0.839), sleep efficiency (P = 0.067), sleep disturbances (P = 0.061), and daily functional disorders (P = 0.114) except for subjective sleep quality (P = 0.016) and use of sleep medications (P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Using both aromatherapies with lavender and damask rose indicated positive effects on sleep quality of the CABG patients, but we could not find a superiority over each other."
