      "abstract": "Resistant starch (RS) is recognized as a nutritional strategy that supports gut and overall host health by modulating gut microbiota. To directly assess the effects of RS on gut microbiota and its role in improving intestinal barrier function in meat ducks, this study first established an antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis model, which was characterized by reduced gut microbial diversity, intestinal dysfunction, and an inflammatory outburst following antibiotic exposure. Whereafter, in addition to the control group, ducks treated with antibiotics for 7 consecutive days were further allocated to two groups and fed the basal diet and RS diet that derived from 12 % raw potato starch until 21 d. The results demonstrated that dietary RS supplementation reversed the antibiotic-induced reduction in microbial diversity and restored the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio. Additionally, RS inclusion enriched beneficial bacterial genera, including Coprobacter, Odoribacter, and Faecalibacterium (LDA score > 3). Post-antibiotic intervention led to a reduction in villus density and muscular thickness, accompanied by a significant downregulation (P < 0.05) of zonula occludens-1 and mucin-2 expression, along with increased serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (P < 0.05). Notably, dietary RS supplementation significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) the expression of glucagon-like peptide receptor and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2, while suppressing caspase transcription. This resulted in increased villus height and muscular thickness in the ileum (P < 0.05). Furthermore, RS intervention remarkably reduced (P < 0.05) pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, particularly interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, in both the ileum and serum. These effects were likely linked to alterations in cecal microbiota, including increased abundances of Barnesiella, Ruminiclostridium 9, Megamonas, Faecalitalea, Adlercreutzia, Coprobacter and Collinsella. In conclusion, dietary RS supplementation mitigated antibiotic-induced cecal microbial dysbiosis and restored intestinal structure by promoting enterocyte proliferation and reducing apoptosis. Consequently, RS supplementation helped alleviate systemic inflammation in meat ducks following antibiotic treatment."

      "abstract": "Although resistant starch (RS) isolated from raw starch exhibits established regulatory effects on the mouse gut microbiota and associated hyperlipidemia, critical questions persist regarding RS in heated foods - the predominant form in the human diets, namely, the role of RS from heated food in the regulation of hyperlipidemia through gut microbiota is still unclear. This study evaluated the effects of a RS (jackfruit heated resistant starch, JFRS3) from heat-treated jackfruit native starch (JFNS) on hyperlipidemia in golden hamster gut microbes. Compared with JFNS, JFRS3 developed an irregular block-like shape with numerous grooves, exhibited more ordered structures (R1047/1022: 2.952 and R1022/995: 0.964) and greater crystallinity (relative crystallinity (RC): 21.96 %), and transformed into a C-type crystalline structure. Additionally, JFRS3 demonstrated significant antihyperlipidemic effects, which included an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels (4.36 mmol/L) and reductions in triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (14.39, 4.55, and 4.61 mmol/L, respectively), thereby alleviating liver fatty lesions, reducing fat accumulation, and inhibiting adipocyte enlargement. These effects were closely linked to intestinal microbial changes, such as specific microbial enrichment and enhanced gut microbial diversity, potentially influenced by the structural properties of JFRS3. Furthermore, the consumption of JFRS3 was more effective in slowing weight gain and improving blood lipid profiles compared with raw RS present in JFNS. These findings prove that JFRS3 modulates hyperlipidemia induced by a high-fat diet and contributes to the development of alternative strategies for managing high-fat-diet-associated hyperlipidemia."

      "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia, a prevalent metabolic disorder disease, has become a significant global health challenge. In this research, we looked into the effects of buckwheat resistant starch (BRS) supplementation on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in hyperlipidemic mice. Results showed that HBRS intervention significantly inhibited weight gain in high-fat diet mice, reducing body weight by 2.91 g versus MC group. Serum TC, TG, and LDL-C decreased by 74.25 %, 76.79 %, and 56.25 % respectively, while HDL-C increased by 67.66 %. HBRS mitigated hepatic steatosis and epididymal adipocyte hypertrophy. HBRS downregulated TNF-α and IL-6 by 24.4 % and 18.25 %, respectively, and upregulated IL-10 by 15.35 %. It modulated lipid metabolism genes by suppressing SREBP2, FAS, SCD1 and activating PPARα/CPT1. Moreover, BRS improved gut microbiota composition by lowering the F/B ratio and enhancing populations of SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, and Parabacteroides). BRS significantly increased the total levels of SCFAs in the gut. Compared to the MC group, HBRS resulted in increases of 40.2 %, 51.8 %, and 68.3 % in acetate, propionate, and butyrate, respectively. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BRS serves as a beneficial nutritional resource for the management of hyperlipidemia."

      "abstract": "Diabetes is one of the major chronic diseases endangering human health. Because of the low glycemic index, RS(resistant starch) plays an important role in the intervention and treatment of diabetes. Based on our previous studies, the mechanism of RS is systematically discussed from the molecular level (the relationship between starch molecular conformation and RS, the relationship between double-helix structure and RS, and the relationship between molecular complexation and RS) and granular level (the relationship between amylase penetration and RS, the relationship between crystallinity and RS, and the relationship between amylose/amylopectin content and RS). In addition, with more in-depth studies in the preparation and formation reason of RS, the current classification of RS may not satisfy our current understanding of RS. In this paper, a new classification of RS is proposed. RS is classified into 10 types from two aspects (reparation methods and formation reasons), which may make it easier to understand the different RS. This paper may provide a reference for the research of RS."

      "abstract": "Type 3 resistant starch (RS3) regulates diet-related metabolic diseases by promoting intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lactate production, and facilitating microbial lactate-to-butyrate fermentation. However, its precise in vivo mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, we studied the effects of type 3 lotus seed resistant starch (LRS3) and sodium lactate (SL) on colonic microbiota composition, metabolism, and lipid parameters. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which LRS3 and SL modulate colonic microbiota and metabolism to mitigate hyperlipidemia in rats induced by a high-fat diet. Results showed LRS3 increased colonic microbial diversity, shifting the composition towards that of healthy rats. LRS3 intake reduced lactic acid-producing bacteria such as Allobaculum, Collinsella, and Blautia in the colon while promoting SCFAs-producing Ruminococcaceae. SL alone stimulated Lachnospiraceae growth. When both were administered, there was a significant increase in Treponema and Ruminococcaceae. The co-intervention of LRS3 and SL significantly affected lipid metabolism-related metabolites, up-regulating palmitic acid while down-regulating androsterone and phosphatidylcholine (PC) substances PC (14:0/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), influencing unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathways and inhibiting steroid hormone biosynthesis. Finally, via the microbial-metabolism-lipid correlation network, we identified that LRS3 and SL increased SCFAs production through Treponema and Ruminococcaceae metabolism, influencing organic acid and lipid composition in the colon. This indirectly reduced blood lipid levels in hyperlipidemic rats by modulating intestinal microecology."

The results showed that combined fertilization did not change the crystalline diffraction pattern of the resistant starch samples (exhibiting a B-type crystalline structure), but significantly (p < 0.05) increased the relative crystallinity (35.07-44.36 %). In addition, combined fertilization enhanced resistant starch content (28.36-35.22 %), apparent amylose content (20.50-35.06 %), particle size, pasting temperature (50.30-50.66 °C) and gelatinization enthalpy (2.77-4.65 J g-1). Conversely, higher fertilization levels were associated with lower light transmittance, water solubility, swelling power and viscosity. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that buckwheat resistant starch and apparent amylose content were significantly (p < 0.01) positively correlated with particle size and gelatinization temperatures, while negatively correlated with viscosity. This study provides a theoretical basis for optimizing the application of nitrogen and sulfur fertilizers to improve the properties of buckwheat resistant starch.",

Microscopic analysis further revealed that the unique granular structure and morphology of EFTFS underwent gelatinization and aggregation, which reduced swelling capacity. In this regard, the RS produced by lactic acid showed the least swelling capacity, followed by malic and citric acid due to the merged and coarse structure. Paste viscosities were significantly lower in all modified starches than native starch, with the lowest viscosities observed for EFTFS treated with lactic acid. The resistant starch created from FTF depicted slowly digestible malic and citric acid content due to the creation of significant cross-linkage compared to lactate and native starch.

However, the bioactive mechanism of RS relieving AD needs to be elucidated. In this study, RS was prepared using chickpeas. Its microstructure and crystal structure were thoroughly characterized. Chickpea RS significantly improved the clinical symptoms and restored Th1/Th2 immune balance in mice with AD induced by calcipotriol. These benefits were eliminated by antibiotic cocktail treatment, suggesting that gut microbiota mediated the alleviation effects of chickpea RS on AD. Based on metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomic analysis, chickpea RS treatment significantly increased the proportions of Butyricimonas virosa, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, and Faecalibaculum rodentium, and a total of 206 differential metabolites were altered, especially the increase in propionate and butyrate production. Furthermore, we found that acylated butyrate, but not propionate, improved the pathological characteristics by activating GPR109A, which inhibit the phosphorylation levels of IκB-α, p50, p65, JNK, and p-JNK. Collectively, chickpea RS exhibited the bioactive function for regulating the communication of the gut-skin axis via regulating butyrate production to activate GPR109A.",

After embedding KGM and applying HMT, the gelatinization temperature of CS increased by 8.09 °C, and the resistant starch content of cooked CS increased from 8.46% to 28.05%.

Rheological analysis revealed that KGM addition increased both the storage and loss moduli of CS, and the crystallinity of KGM-embedded CS decreased to 18.58%. Moreover, short-chain fatty acid production and the abundance of beneficial bacteria, including Lachnospiraceae, Prevotellaceae, Anaerostipes, and Weissella, were higher in the RS1 group compared to the high-amylose maize starch and fructooligosaccharide groups. In the in vivo digestibility experiment, the peak blood glucose level in the RS1 group (7.08 mmol/L) was significantly lower than that in the CS group (8.57 mmol/L).

The Canna edulis type 5 resistant starch (Ce-RS5) prepared using Canna edulis native starch and lauric acid exhibited a high compound index and resistant starch content, along with decreased swelling power and enhanced starch granule stability. The crystallinity of Ce-RS5 was decreased, and its crystal structure displayed a B+V pattern. Microscopically, the surface appeared rough with deepened grooves, and the granules were loose. Feeding mice with 1.5 g/kg and 3 g/kg of Ce-RS5 significantly reduced their body weight, positively regulated their blood lipid levels, and improved liver damage and fat accumulation. Additionally, Ce-RS5 promoted the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, such as norank_f_Muribaculaceae, and inhibited the abundance of harmful bacteria like Colidextribacter. This study provides the first evidence of the hypolipidemic and weight loss effects of Ce-RS5 in hyperlipidemia mice."

As people age, constipation becomes increasingly common in older adults, causing varying degrees of physical and psychological harm to them. Dietary intervention is a common nonpharmacological therapy. Resistant starch is a type of dietary fiber that can regulate the gut microbiota and alleviate chronic constipation. However, few studies have explored the effects of different types of rice on chronic constipation in older adults. This protocol aims to evaluate the effects of rice with different contents of resistant starch on chronic constipation in old adults. This trial is a double-blind, two-arm randomized controlled trial. Older adults with chronic constipation residing in long-term care facilities will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive A rice (resistant starch: 11-20%) or receive B rice (resistant starch: 0.1-0.5%). Both groups will adopt the serving of individual dishes, and the nutrition experts calculated the consumption of rice in the two groups according to the different conditions of each older person to ensure that the number of calories in the meal remained unchanged and that the other dietary components remained unchanged. The intervention will last for a total of 24 weeks. Participants will undergo follow-up via questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 weeks during the intervention. The primary outcome will be constipation symptoms assessed by the Wexner questionnaire. The secondary outcomes will be quality of life, depression, anxiety and sleep quality. This is the first randomized controlled trial on the effects of rice with different contents of resistant starch on chronic constipation in older adults. It is expected that this study, if proven effective in relieving constipation symptoms in older adults, will provide evidence-based constipation care for medical staff.Trial registration number: retrospectively registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease which is closely related with the overproduced reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and disordered intestinal microbes. However, current therapeutic methods usually ignored the interrelation among the pathogenesis, and mainly focused on a single factor, inducing clinical outcomes unsatisfied. Herein, biocompatible infinite coordination polymers of drugs (Ce-SASP-RS ICPs) composed of Ce ions, FDA-approved drug sulfasalazine (SASP) and natural ingredient resistant starch (RS) were developed for synergistic treatment of IBD. The proper Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio in Ce-SASP-RS ICPs can endow them with SOD-like activities, POD-like activities and •OH scavenging ability, which guarantee Ce-SASP-RS ICPs to simultaneously kill bacteria and maintain ROS balance through cascade reactions. Owing to the recovered redox balance microenvironment, SASP in Ce-SASP-RS ICPs can better play their anti-inflammatory function. Moreover, benefitting from the recovered metabolic balance of ROS and inflammatory cytokines in colon, resistant starch can also function better in modifying gut microbiota through generating short-chain fatty acids. Collectively, Ce-SASP-RS ICPs can synergistically restore intestinal metabolic microenvironment through modulating redox balance, attenuating inflammation and modifying intestinal flora. Hence, in view of the mutual influences among IBD pathogenesis, this work presents a synergistic intervention approach for effectively treating IBD.",

The concentration of sodium alginate (SA) significantly influenced the thickness of the CA shell, thereby affecting the structural characteristics, physicochemical properties, and digestibility of the resulting beads. As the SA concentration increased from 0.5 % to 2 %, the CA shell thickness expanded from 0.612 μm to 1.837 μm, becoming denser and limiting the infiltration of enzymatic liquids during digestion. The initial gelatinization temperature of the beads exceeded 100 °C, and the enthalpy value of the 2 % SA beads was 25.40 ± 0.17 J·g-1, indicating excellent thermal stability. After heat treatment, the crystallinity reached 90.50 %. The RS content of the 2 % SA beads was as high as 72.66 ± 0.15 %, with an estimated glycemic index of 54.72, classifying them as low-glycemic index foods.

However, the effects of cold storage on the glycemic response of the second meal of cereals remain unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the postprandial glycemic responses between the paired glutinous and non-glutinous grains, either fresh-cooked or refrigerated, after both the first and second meals. In this randomized crossover trial, eighteen healthy female participants consumed eight test meals, each containing 50 g of carbohydrate, including fresh-cooked non-glutinous and glutinous rice, non-glutinous and glutinous millet, and their refrigerated counterparts (4 °C for 24 h). Postprandial blood glucose and insulin were measured at 240 min and 120 min after breakfast. After a standard lunch, the participants' blood glucose concentrations were measured within 180 min. The rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS), and resistant starch (RS) contents of the samples were determined by in vitro enzymatic analysis. Cold-stored non-glutinous rice (CR) and cold-stored non-glutinous millet (CM) had a 24.4% and 29.5% lower incremental area under the curve (iAUCglu) of glucose within 240 min compared to the control (fresh-cooked rice non-glutinous, FR), respectively (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between either the cold or hot glutinous grains and FR with respect to postprandial glycemic and insulinemic parameters. After a standard lunch, the fresh-cooked non-glutinous millet (FM) achieved a 39.1% lower iAUCglu0-180 compared to the FR (p < 0.05). FM had the highest percentage of SDS (64.8%, p < 0.05) among all grain samples. Refrigeration treatment reduced the glycemic excursion only in non-glutinous grains at the first meal, but the FM instead of CM demonstrated a significant second meal effect.",

Heat-moisture treatments, including annealing (90 °C, 40-70 % moisture content) and pressure heating (121 °C, 10-40 % moisture content), were employed to further enhance the RS content of pea RS3. The relationship between the structural changes and digestibility of pea RS3 was investigated. The results showed significant increases in relative crystallinity, particle size, gelatinization temperature, and RS content, while swelling power, pasting viscosity, and rapidly digestible starch content were markedly decreased after heat-moisture treatment. A strong positive correlation (r = 0.94*) was observed between relative crystallinity and RS content. The highest RS content of 85.6 % was achieved after pressure heating at 20 % moisture content, which was notably higher than the 45.6 % RS content before heat-moisture treatment.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cooking and cooling chickpea pasta on the RS content, glycemic response, and GI in healthy subjects. Methods: Twelve healthy subjects of both sexes, aged 18-65 years, participated in this study. Each person consumed two standardized portions of chickpea pasta: (i) freshly cooked (FCP) and (ii) cooked chickpea pasta which was cooled for 24 h at 4 °C and reheated before consumption (CCP). Glucose solution was provided as a reference food. Participants consumed chickpea pasta in a random order. GI measurements were completed using the standard methodology and calculated according to the ISO 2010 standard. Results: The cooling and reheating process significantly increased the RS content of boiled chickpea pasta (from 1.83 g/100 g to 3.65 g/100 g) and had a beneficial effect on postprandial glycemia in healthy individuals. The CCP pasta had a significantly lower GI value than the FCP pasta (33 vs. 39, p = 0.0022). A significant difference in the glucose, as identified by the incremental area under the curve (IAUC), was observed between the CCP and FCP (1327.9 ± 414.8 mg/dL/min vs. 1556.1 ± 456.9 mg/dL/min, p = 0.0022). The cooling-reheating process did not affect the sensory attributes of the chickpea pasta. In general, the overall acceptability of the CCP pasta was similar to that of the FCP pasta. Conclusions: The results of our study support the hypothesis that a reduced glycemic response after simple changes in technological intervention leads to a decrease in postprandial blood glucose and GI. This can be helpful for people who need to control postprandial glycemia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that consumption of resistant starch (RS) has beneficial effects on the gut microbiota and immune function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of RS on inflammation, uremic toxins, and renal function in patients with CKD through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-2020. We included randomized controlled trials comparing RS supplementation to placebo. The National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) databases, and two gray literature sources - Baidu and Research Gate, were used for search, up to 28 August 2024. There was no limitation on publication date, but only manuscripts published in English and Chinese were included. RESULTS: A total of 645 articles were retrieved. Ten articles met the inclusion criteria, and a total of 355 subjects were included. The analysis revealed that RS dietary intervention can significantly reduce indoxyl sulfate (IS) levels (SMD: -0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.70 to -0.04, p = .03) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (SMD: -0.30, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.02, p = .03). There were no significant differences in the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), p-cresyl sulfate (p-CS), albumin, phosphorus, or tumor necrosis factor-α. CONCLUSIONS: The RS diet has potential beneficial effects on uremic toxin levels and renal function indices in patients with CKD. RS supplementation can reduce uremic toxin levels and improve renal function but does not reduce the inflammatory response in patients with CKD. Nevertheless, results should be cautiously interpreted, because of the limited sample size and different treatment dosages. Further research is necessary to corroborate the beneficial effects of RS2 supplementation in this population.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mung beans contain various antinutritional components. Processing and cooking methods can reduce these antinutritional factors and increase the availability and digestibility of nutrients. Resistant starch is also known as dietary fiber, which helps to reduce the cholesterol and glucose level in blood. It is formed during cooking and storage of food at low temperature. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the effects of cooking and storage temperature on the formation of resistant starch in processed mung bean, as well as its effect on blood glucose levels and lipid profile in humans and rats. METHODS: The common cooking methods namely boiling, steaming after germination, roasting, and pressure cooking were chosen. The cooked samples were stored at different temperatures including freshly prepared within 1 h (T1), stored for 24 h at room temperature (20-22°C) (T2), kept at 4°C for 24 h (T3), and reheated after storing at 4°C for 24 h (T4). RESULTS: The study revealed that germinated-steamed mung beans had significantly higher levels of resistant starch (27.63 ± 0.76), and lower level of glycemic index (26.28 ± 3.08) and amylose (40.91 ± 0.06) when stored at 4°C for 24 h (T3) followed by (T2), (T4), and (T1) as compared to other cooking methods (boiling, pressure cooking, and roasting). The germinated-steamed mung beans (T1) resulted in 96% decline in blood glucose parameters of rats (36 Wistar albino rats aged 2 to 3 months were selected) than the control group as observed in 28 days diet intervention (100 mg/kg resistant starch orally). CONCLUSION: There is a need to make people aware about the selection of appropriate cooking (steamed after germination) and storage methods (T3) to increase the RS content and to lower the glycemic index of food at domestic level."

Among the experimental groups, except for the control group, we induced PD rat models by subcutaneous injection of rotenone in the neck and back. After model induction, a 28-day drug intervention was conducted. Various techniques have been employed, including behavioral analysis, Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP nick-ends. labeling (TUNEL) and Nissl staining to investigate the effect of Canna edulis RS3-resistant starch on the substantia nigra and neuronal apoptosis-related markers in the brains of PD model rats. Our study revealed that Canna edulis RS3, a resistant starch, significantly reduced the climbing time of PD model rats, prolonged their hanging time, lowered the expression levels of the inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, increased the number of TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, and decreased the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Furthermore, Canna edulis RS3 elevated the protein expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Bcl-2 while reducing those of Bax, TLR4, NLRP3,and p-P65, and mitigated apoptosis and morphological changes in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region. Our results suggest that Canna edulis RS3-resistant starch may offer therapeutic benefits for PD patients with PD by potentially influencing inflammation and apoptosis in the dopaminergic system."

      "abstract": "The physical modification of starch to produce resistant starch (RS) is a viable strategy for the glycemic index (GI) lowering of foods and functionality improvement in starchy food products. RS cannot be digested in the small intestine but can be fermented in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids rather than being broken down by human digestive enzymes into glucose. This provides major health advantages, like better blood sugar regulation, weight control, and a lower chance of chronic illnesses. This article provides a concise review of the recent developments in physical starch modification techniques, including annealing, extrusion, high-pressure processing, radiation, and heat-moisture treatment. Specifically, the focus of this paper is on the alteration of the crystalline structure of starch caused by the heat-moisture treatment and annealing and its impact on the resistance of starch to enzymatic hydrolysis, as well as the granular structure and molecular arrangement of starch caused by extrusion and high-pressure processing, and the depolymerization and crosslinking that results from radiation. The impacts of these alterations on starch's textural qualities, stability, and shelf life are also examined. This review demonstrates how physically modified resistant starch can be used as a flexible food ingredient with both functional and health benefits. These methods are economically and ecologically sustainable since they successfully raise the RS content and improve its functional characteristics without the need for chemical reagents. The thorough analysis of these methods and how they affect the structural characteristics and health advantages of RS emphasizes the material's potential as an essential component in the creation of functional foods that satisfy contemporary dietary and health requirements."

This study aimed to optimize the HMT conditions for HAS and apply the resulting HMT-HAS to triticale noodles to develop low-glycemic-index products. HMT significantly increased the resistant starch (RS) content and decreased the rapidly digestible starch (RDS) content of HAS. The treatment conditions-temperature, heating time, and moisture content-were found to significantly influence the starch composition. Optimal HMT conditions were determined using response surface methodology: a temperature of 108 °C, a heating time of 5.8 h, and a moisture content of 25.50%. Under these conditions, the RS content of HMT-HAS was 60.23%, nearly double that of the untreated sample. Increasing the level of HMT-HAS in triticale noodles led to significant decreases in short-range order, relative crystallinity, and viscosities, while the RS content increased from 12.08% to 34.41%. These findings suggest that incorporating HMT-HAS into triticale noodles effectively enhances starch digestive resistance, supporting the development of functional, low-glycemic-index triticale-based foods."

      "abstract": "Long-term dysfunction of glucose metabolism causes cardiac dysfunction called diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of RS on the process of DCM, mouse models induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) were fed RS (2 g/kg/day) and vehicle treatment (by oral gavage) for 14 weeks. Various analyses, including qRT-PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence staining, histology staining, cardiac function, and diversity detection of intestinal microbiota were performed. RS intervention could directly improve myocardial fibrosis, hypertrophy, apoptosis, and cardiac insufficiency in DCM. These beneficial effects may be achieved by elevating the expression of IGF-1, activating the ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, by carrying out nano LC-MS/MS analyses and 16S rDNA sequencing, we found RS might primarily affect proteins in the cytoplasm involved in post-translational modification, protein conversion, and signal transduction mechanisms. RS altered intestinal microbiota and improved intestinal mucosal permeability towards a favorable direction in DCM. This multidimensional assessment of RS suggests that might be a promising approach towards the treatment of DCM.",

Clarifying the effect of treatment conditions on fern root starch is key to achieving industrialized production of fern root resistant starch. In the present study, fern root starch was treated by the autoclave-enzymatic method with pullulanase, glucoamylase and mixed enzyme. RESULTS: The content of resistant starch in fern roots treated with mixed enzyme was the highest (24.07 ± 1.11%), which was approximately 320% times that of the native starch, had the best water-holding capacity (151.08%), vital transparency and freeze-thaw stability. By contrast, the solubility, swelling and viscosity were lower than natural starch. In addition, mixed enzyme shows a denser structure, and the crystal form changes from C-type to V-type, with a high relative crystallinity and significantly enhanced thermal stability. CONCLUSION: After mixed enzyme combined with autoclave treatment, the content of resistant starch in fern root was greatly increased. The modified starch molecules did not produce new functional groups, which made the crystal structure of starch molecules more compact, and resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis and high temperature thermal stability were significantly enhanced. This provides a positive reference for further in-depth study of fern root starch, improvement of utilization value, development and innovation of new food health products, and diabetes treatment. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Probiotics and prebiotics have gained attention for their potential health benefits. However, their efficacy hinges on probiotic survival through the harsh gastrointestinal environment. Microencapsulation techniques provide a solution, with resistant starch (RS)-based techniques showing promise in maintaining probiotic viability. Specifically, RS-encapsulated probiotics significantly improved probiotic survival in gastric acid, bile salts, and simulated intestinal conditions. This study investigated the effects of a resistant-starch-encapsulated probiotic cocktail (RS-Pro) in the context of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy, which frequently induces microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal mucositis. Female BALB/c mice were divided into three groups: a 5-FU group, a 5-FU+Pro group receiving free probiotics, and a 5-FU+RS-Pro group receiving RS-encapsulated probiotics. After 28 days of treatment, analyses were conducted on fecal microbiota, intestinal histology, peripheral blood cell counts, and body and organ weights. It was revealed by 16S rRNA MiSeq sequencing that 5-FU treatment disrupted gut microbiota composition, reduced microbial diversity, and caused dysbiosis. RS-Pro treatment restored microbial diversity and increased the population of beneficial bacteria, such as Muribaculaceae, which play roles in carbohydrate and polyphenol metabolism. Furthermore, 5-FU administration induced moderate intestinal mucositis, characterized by reduced cellularity and shortened villi. However, RS-Pro treatment attenuated 5-FU-induced intestinal damage, preserving villus length. Mild leukopenia observed in the 5-FU-treated mice was partially alleviated in 5-FU+Pro and 5-FU+RS-Pro groups. These findings suggest that RS-Pro may serve as an adjunct to chemotherapy, potentially reducing adverse effects and improving therapeutic outcomes in future clinical applications."

This study aimed to explore the potential effects and mechanisms of resistant starch (RS) in HFCS-induced colon tumorigenesis. METHODS: The azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) and ApcMin/+ mice models were used to investigate the roles of HFCS and RS in CRC in vivo. An immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining analysis was used to detect the expression of proliferation-related proteins in tissues. 16S rRNA sequencing for microbial community, gas chromatography for short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and mass spectrometry analysis for glycolysis products in the intestines were performed. Furthermore, lactic acid assay kit was used to detect the glycolysis levels in vitro. RESULTS: RS suppressed HFCS-induced colon tumorigenesis through reshaping the microbial community. Mechanistically, the alteration of the microbial community after RS supplement increased the levels of intestinal SCFAs, especially butyrate, leading to the suppression of glycolysis and CRC cell proliferation by downregulating HK2. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified RS as a candidate of protective factors in CRC and may provide a potential target for HFCS-related CRC treatment.",

      "abstract": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is commonly used as the primary chemotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it can lead to unwanted chemoresistance. Resistant starch (RS), which functions similarly to fermentable dietary fiber, has the potential to reduce the risk of CRC. The effects of RS on improving CRC-associated cachectic symptoms and 5-FU chemotherapy-induced microbial dysbiosis remain unknown. Female BALB/cByJNarl mice were randomly divided into four groups: one tumor group (with CT26 colonic carcinoma but no treatment) and three CT26 colonic carcinoma-bearing groups that were administered 20 mg/kg 5-FU (T+5-FU group), a probiotic cocktail (4 × 108 CFUs) plus chemotherapy (T+5-FU+Pro), or resistant-starch-encapsulated probiotics plus chemotherapy (T+5-FU+RS-Pro). T+5-FU and T+5-FU+RS-Pro administration significantly suppressed tumor growth and activated apoptotic cell death in CT26-bearing mice. 5-FU-induced increases in inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB signaling were mitigated by the Pro or RS-Pro supplementation. A gut microbial composition comparison indicated that the abundance of intestinal bacteria in the T and T+5-FU groups decreased significantly, while the groups receiving Pro or RS-Pro maintained a greater abundance and healthy gut microbiota composition, suggesting that RS can reduce the microbial dysbiosis that occurs during 5-FU chemotherapy. The use of RS-Pro before chemotherapy should be considered for the regulation of chemotherapy-associated cachectic symptoms, inflammation, and chemotherapy-induced microbial dysbiosis."

Additionally, the study investigated enzymatic inhibition and mRNA expression of starch synthesis genes (RAmy1a, GBSSIa, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb). Glucose transporter gene expression (GLUT1 and GLUT4) patterns were analyzed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes to evaluate glucose uptake in B. stercoris PE treated rice varieties. The application of B. stercoris PE enhanced grain quality by imparting starch ultra-structural rigidity, inhibiting starch metabolizing enzymes, and inducing molecular changes in starch synthesis genes.

Factors predicting the response to RS are not yet established and would be useful for developing precision nutrition approaches that maximize the benefits of dietary fiber intake. We sought to identify predictors of gut microbiota response to RS supplementation. We enrolled 76 healthy adults into a 7-week crossover study with 59 individuals completing the study. Participants consumed RS type 2 (RS2), RS type 4 (RS4), and digestible starch, for 10 d each with 5-d washout periods in between. We collected fecal and saliva samples and food records during each treatment period. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and measured fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), salivary amylase (AMY1) gene copy number, and salivary amylase activity (SAA). Dietary fiber intake was predictive of the relative abundance of several amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at the end of both RS treatments. AMY1-related metrics were not predictive of response to RS. SAA was only predictive of the relative abundance of one ASV after digestible starch supplementation. Interestingly, SCFA concentrations increased the most during digestible starch supplementation. Treatment order (the order of consumption of RS2 and RS4), alpha diversity, and a subset of ASVs were predictive of SCFA changes after RS supplementation. Based on our findings, dietary fiber intake and gut microbiome composition would be informative if assessed prior to recommending RS supplementation because these data can be used to predict changes in specific ASVs and fecal SCFA concentrations. These findings lay a foundation to support the premise that using a precision nutrition approach to optimize the benefits of dietary fibers such as RS could be an effective strategy to compensate for the low consumption of dietary fiber nationwide.",

Compared with native starch, the resistant starch (RS) content of esterified starch treated with 3 kV/cm significantly increased by 17.13 %, whereas that of starch produced by the conventional method increased by only 5.91 %. Furthermore, assisted esterification at low electric fields (1.5-3 kV/cm) promotes ester carbonyl grafting on the surface of starch granules, increases steric hindrance and promotes the rearrangement of the amorphous regions of starch, which increases the density of the double-helical structure. These structural changes slow down starch digestion and increase the RS content. Therefore, this study presents a potential method for increasing the RS content of starch products using PEF to achieve the desired digestibility.",

We performed a double-blind randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of Ce-RS3 on lipids in mild hyperlipidemia. One hundred and fifteen patients were included followed the recruitment criteria, and were randomly allocated to receive Ce-RS3 or placebo (native starch from Canna edulis) for 12 weeks (20 g/day). In addition to serum lipids, complete blood counts, serum inflammatory factors, antioxidant indexes, and dietary survey, 16 S rRNA sequencing technique was utilized to analyze the gut microbiota alterations. Targeted quantitative metabolomics (TQM) was used to detect metabolite changes. Compared with the placebo, Ce- RS3 significantly decreased levels of total cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased the glutathione peroxidase. Based on the 16 S rRNA sequencing, TQM, the correlation analysis, as well as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG) and Genomes and Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) analysis, we found that Ce-RS3 could increase the abundances of genera Faecalibacterium and Agathobacter, while reduce the abundances of genera norank_f_Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae_R-7_ group to regulate phenylalanine metabolism, which could reduce the fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid elongation in the mitochondria to lower blood lipids. Conclusively, we firstly confirmed the feasibility of Ce-RS3 for clinical application, which presents a novel, effective therapy for the mild hyperlipidemia. (Chictr. org. cn.

Structural data revealed that chlorogenic acid (CA)/linoleic acid (LA) functioned through noncovalent interactions to form a more ordered structure and fortify antidigestibility in wheat starch (WS)-CA/LA complexes; the resistant starch (RS) contents of WS-CA, WS-LA, and WS-CA-LA complexes were 23.40 ± 1.56%, 21.25 ± 1.87%, and 35.47 ± 2.16%, respectively. Dietary intervention with WS-CA/LA complexes effectively suppressed detrimental alterations in colon tissue morphology induced by HFD and repaired the gut barrier in ZO-1 and MUC-2 levels. WS-CA/LA complexes could augment gut barrier-promoting microbes including Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, and Muribaculum, accompanied by an increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and elevated expression of SCFA receptors. Moreover, WS-CA/LA complexes modulated secondary bile acid metabolism by decreasing taurochenodeoxycholic, cholic, and deoxycholic acids, leading to the activation of bile acid receptors. Collectively, this study offered guiding significance in the manufacture of functional diets for a weak gut barrier.",

      "abstract": "Since hydrothermal treatments can enhance resistant starch (RS) content in rice and provide health benefits when consumed, a less laborious and non-destructive method to determine RS content is needed. Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is hypothesized as a suitable method to quantify RS content in rice after hydrothermal treatment with its sensitivity for the intermolecular forces increase in the formation of RS. In this study, we first used the traditional in vitro hydrolysis method to determine the content of RS in rice. Then, the potential of starch absorbance peaks to quantify RS content after three commonly used hydrothermal methods, soaking, mild heat-moisture treatment, and parboiling, was investigated. The second derivative intensities of the peak at 9.0, 10.5, 12.1, and 13.1 THz were confirmed as being correlated with RS content and showed the high accuracy to predict RS content in samples (R2 > 0.96). Our results indicate the RS content of hydrothermally treated rice can be accurately quantified using these peaks.",

      "abstract": "Dietary interventions are receiving increasing attention for maintaining host health and diminishing disease risk. This study endeavored to elucidate the intervention effect of chlorogenic acid coupled with extruded rice starch (CGA-ES) in mitigating lipid metabolism disorders induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in rats. First, a significant increase in resistant starch (RS) and a decrease in the predicted glycemic index (pGI) were observed in CGA-ES owing to the formation of an ordered structure (Dm, single helix, and V-type crystalline structure) and partly released CGA. Compared to a physical mixture of starch and chlorogenic acid (CGA + S), CGA-ES showed a more potent effect in alleviating lipid metabolism disorders, manifesting as reduced levels of blood glucose, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP), as well as body weight. It is correlated with an improvement in the gut microecology, featuring bacteria known for cholesterol reduction and butyrate production (Butyricicoccus, Bifidobacterium, Fusicatenibacter, Turicibacter, and Enterorhabdus), along with bile acid, butyrate and PG (PG (17:0/16:0) and PG (18:1/16:0)). The RS fraction of CGA-ES was found to be the main contributor. These findings would provide evidence for future studies to regulate lipid metabolism disorders, and even obesity using CGA-ES.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complicated inflammatory disease with a continually growing incidence. In this study, resistant starch was obtained from purple sweet potato (PSPRS) by the enzymatic isolation method. Then, the structural properties of PSPRS and its protective function in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis were investigated. The structural characterization results revealed that the crystallinity of PSPRS changed from CA-type to A-type, and the lamellar structure was totally destroyed during enzymatic hydrolysis. Compared to DSS-induced colitis mice, PSPRS administration significantly improved the pathological phenotype and colon inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. ELISA results indicated that DSS-induced colitis mice administered with PSPRS showed higher IL-10 and IgA levels but lower TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels. Meanwhile, high doses (300 mg/kg) of PSPRS significantly increased the production of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing results showed that the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and the potential probiotic bacteria levels were notably increased in the PSPRS treatment group, such as Lactobacillus, Alloprevotella, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, and Bifidobacterium. Simultaneously, harmful bacteria like Bacteroides, Staphylococcus, and Akkermansia were significantly inhibited by the administration of a high dose of PSPRS (p < 0.05). Therefore, PSPRS has the potential to be a functional food for promoting intestinal health and alleviating UC."

The highest RS amount was observed for Hi Maize, which kept 84% and 72% of the initial RS content in the model systems and cake, respectively. Only the cakes made with Hi Maize reached the criteria for the health claim related to the reduction of post-prandial glycemic response (European Union regulation).

Scanning electron microscopy results showed a rougher surface and more complete debranching of the homogenized coenzyme rice-resistant starch granules. FT-IR and X-ray diffraction results showed that the homogenization treatment exhibited a spiral downward trend on rice starch relative crystallinity and a spiral upward trend on starch debranching and recrystallization. The 4-week dietary intervention in db/db type 2 diabetic mice showed that homogeneous coenzyme rice-resistant starch had a better glycemic modulating effect than normal debranched starch and had a tendency to interfere with the index of liver damage in T2DM mice. Additionally, homogeneous coenzyme rice-resistant starch proved more effective in improving intestinal flora disorders and enhancing the abundance of probiotics in T2DM mice.",

      "abstract": "Fermentation of dietary fiber (DF) is beneficial for gut health, but its prebiotic effects are often impeded in the distal large intestine because of the fast degradation of fermentable substrates. One way to enhance the prebiotic effect of DF is to deliver fibers to the lower parts of the gut, which can be achieved by mixing different kinds of fiber. Therefore, in the present study, an ileum-cannulated pig model was employed to investigate the fermentation influence in the large intestine by infusing resistant starch solely (RS, fast fermentable fiber) and mixing with other fibers (xylan or cellulose). Twenty-four ileum-cannulated growing pigs were divided into four groups: one control group receiving saline ileal infusions and three experimental groups infused with RS, RS with xylan, or RS with cellulose. Fecal and plasma samples were analyzed for gut microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and blood biochemistry. Results indicated no significant differences between the RS and control group for the microbiome and SCFA concentration (p > 0.05). However, RS combined with fibers, particularly xylan, resulted in enhanced and prolonged fermentation, marked by an increase in Blautia and higher lactate and acetate production (p < 0.05). In contrast, RS with cellulose infusion enriched bacterial diversity in feces (p < 0.05). Blood biochemistry parameters showed no significant differences across groups (p > 0.05), though a trend of increased glucose levels was noted in the treatment groups (p < 0.1). Overall, RS alone had a limited impact on the distal hindgut microbiota due to rapid fermentation in the proximal gut, whereas combining RS with other fibers notably improved gut microecology by extending the fermentation process."

The results showed that the RS content of modified rice flour was higher than that of rice flour (RF), and dual hydrothermal treatment was more effective than single hydrothermal treatment. Adhesion and aggregation occurred between the particles of modified rice flour. Both crystallinity and short-range ordering were increased in modified rice flour compared to RF. Moreover, the modified rice flour of dual hydrothermal treatment had higher crystallinity and a more ordered short-range structure of starch, which improved RS content to a certain extent. Compared to single hydrothermal treatment, the modified rice flour of dual hydrothermal treatment had a lower viscoelasticity and a better thermal stability.

      "abstract": "The immediate and well-documented benefits of carbohydrate restriction include improved glycemic control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Starch, a significant source of carbohydrates, is categorized as rapidly digestible, slowly digestible, or resistant starch (RS). RS, which is a non-viscous fermentable fiber, has shown promise in animal studies for antidiabetic effects by improving glucose metabolism. Although the exact mechanism by which RS affects glucose metabolism remains unclear, it is expected to positively impact glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The fermentation of RS by colonic microbiota in the large bowel produces short-chain fatty acids, which exert multiple metabolic effects on glucose regulation and homeostasis. Moreover, RS may influence glucose metabolism via bile acid modulation, independent of its fermentation. Diets rich in RS could aid in blood glucose homeostasis. However, it is uncertain whether they can alter the metabolic pathology associated with glucose regulation. In essence, RS has the potential to lower postprandial glucose levels similarly to a low-glycemic index diet. Yet, its efficacy as a medical nutrition therapy for type 2 diabetes needs further investigation. To confirm the role of RS in glycemic control and to possibly recommend it as an additional dietary approach for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a well-designed, large-scale intervention is required.",

The value of the prebiotic activity of MCF hydrolysed acid (HA) is 0.03, and debranching pullulanase (DP) is 0.02 against Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). The prebiotic effect value of MCF HA and DP were 0.76 and 0.60, respectively. The prebiotic index value of MCF HA and DP were 0.60 and 0.48, respectively. This study confirms that MCF HA and DP are good prebiotic candidates because they have resistant starch content, low starch digestibility, and resistance to simulated gastric fluid hydrolysis than unmodified corn flour."

The role of the preparation methods and the mechanism of RS3 formation were analyzed by studying the multiscale structure and digestibility of the starch. The SEM, NMR, and GPC results showed that hydrothermal-alkali combined with ultrasonication could destroy the granule structure and α-1,6 glycosidic bond of HAMS and reduce the molecular weight of HAMS from 195.306 kDa to 157.115 kDa. The other methods had a weaker degree of effect on the structure of HAMS, especially hydrothermal and hydrothermal combined ultrasonication. The multiscale structural results showed that the relative crystallinity, short-range orderliness, and thermal stability of RS-HAU were significantly higher compared with native HAMS. In terms of digestion, RS-HAU had the highest RS content of 69.40 %.

With correlation analysis, we revealed the relationship between the multiscale structure and the RS content, which can be used to guide the preparation of RS3.",

      "abstract": "Driven by the high economic value of chestnut, creating chestnut-based food with nutritional functions has become a hot spot in food industry. In this study, effect of hot-extrusion treatment (HEX) with starch-proanthocyanidins (PR) interactions (HEX-PR) on chestnut starch (CS) nutritional properties was evaluated from the perspective of structural changes. Results showed that HEX-PR promoted the formation of ordered structure of CS containing single helix, V-type crystalline structure, and starch aggregates, thus increasing the resistant starch (RS) content from 3.25 % to 12.35 %. For the nutritional evaluation, the α-amylase inhibitory activity, antioxidant activity and antiglycation activity of HEX-PR treated CS (HEX-PRS) were enhanced, and the enhancing effect became stronger as PR concentration rose. In addition, HEX-PRS increased the level of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially propionate, and meanwhile enriched beneficial intestinal bacteria especially the Bifidobacterium. Notably, correction analysis showed that the microbial community was closely related to the α-amylase inhibitory activity, antioxidant activity and antiglycation activity. Overall, this study provided an approach for improving the nutritional functions of starch, and could offer guidance for further investigations to improve the nutritional quality of chestnut starch-based foods.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become a major public health concern worldwide. Slowly digested or indigestible carbohydrates such as resistant starch (RS) are associated with a low glycemic index (GI) and the decreased risk of developing T2D. Recently, starch inclusion complexes (ICs) have raised attention due to their thermally stable structure and high RS content. In this study, starch-ascorbyl palmitate (AP) ICs were produced using two different methods with hydrothermal treatments performed, and their in vitro digestion kinetics and in vivo glycemic response in C57BL/6J mice were investigated to determine their potential as a new type of RS, i.e., RS5. After treatments of annealing followed by acid hydrolysis (ANN-ACH), IC samples produced by both methods retained V-type crystalline structure. Either in their raw or treated conditions, V6h-AP ICs prepared using the \"empty\" V-type method exhibited a more favorable hydrolysis pattern as compared to its counterpart produced by the DMSO method in terms of a lower hydrolysis rate and equilibrium concentration (C∞) (p < 0.05). From the in vitro results, the ANN-ACH treated V6h-AP IC exhibited an estimated GI (eGI) value of 54.83, falling within the range of low GI foods and was the lowest among all tested samples (p < 0.05). Consistent with the in vitro digestion kinetics, the in vivo results showed that mice fed with ANN-ACH V6h-AP IC exhibited a modest glycemic response as evidenced by the lowest increase in postprandial blood glucose and AUC blood glucose (p < 0.05). In addition, the in vivo GI of the ANN-ACH V6h-AP IC (39.53) was the lowest among all the sample treatments and was even lower than that of the RS2 comparison (56, p < 0.05), indicating its more pronounced effect in modulating the postprandial glycemic response in mice and great potential as a new RS5.",

In addition to exercise and physical activity, fiber-rich foods may be a first-line prophylactic to manage obesity. This study investigated in vivo dietary intervention with high-amylose maize starch (HAMS) and starch-entrapped microspheres (MS) to treat high-fat diet induced metabolic disorder and gut microbiome dysbiosis in mice. MS more efficiently controlled body weight as well as adipose tissue mass compared to HAMS. Furthermore, MS significantly reduced blood glucose, insulin, lipid and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels compared to the high-fat diet, while the effects of HAMS were less pronounced. The MS-altered gut microbiota composition favoring Streptococcaceae, Bacilli, Firmicutes and unclassified Clostridiales was predicted to promote fatty acid, pantothenate and Coenzyme A biosynthesis. In line with this, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA), in particular, propionate concentration was observed in MS-fed mice. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanistic action of MS on intestinal homeostasis, providing a basis for future dietary therapeutic applications.",

To investigate the effects of resistant starch (RS) as a microbiota-directed dietary supplement for NAFLD treatment, we coupled a 4-month randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in individuals with NAFLD (ChiCTR-IOR-15007519) with metagenomics and metabolomics analysis. Relative to the control (n = 97), the RS intervention (n = 99) resulted in a 9.08% absolute reduction of intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTC), which was 5.89% after adjusting for weight loss. Serum branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and gut microbial species, in particular Bacteroides stercoris, significantly correlated with IHTC and liver enzymes and were reduced by RS. Multi-omics integrative analyses revealed the interplay among gut microbiota changes, BCAA availability, and hepatic steatosis, with causality supported by fecal microbiota transplantation and monocolonization in mice. Thus, RS dietary supplementation might be a strategy for managing NAFLD by altering gut microbiota composition and functionality.",

This work investigated the relationship between RS structure in black Tartary buckwheat and its digestibility by analyzing the effects of autoclaving and autoclave-debranching combined treatments on the multi-scale structure of RS. The results showed that black Tartary buckwheat RS exhibited a more extensive honeycomb-like network structure and enhanced thermal stability than either black Tartary buckwheat native starch (BTBNS) or common buckwheat native starch (CBNS). Autoclaving and autoclaving-debranching converted A-type native starch to V-type and possibly the formation of flavonoid-starch complexes. Autoclaving treatment significantly increased the proportion of short A chain (DP 6-12) and the amylose (AM) content, reduced the viscosity and the total crystallinity. Notably, the autoclave-debranching co-treatment significantly enhanced the resistance of starch to digestion, promoted the formation of perfect microcrystallines, and increased the AM content, short-range ordered degree, and the proportion of long B2 chain (DP 25-36). This study reveals the relationship between the multi-scale structure and digestibility of black Tartary buckwheat RS by autoclaving combined with debranching modification.",

Four spayed and six castrated beagle dogs were divided into a control group (CON) with a diet comprising rice and chicken meal and a treatment group (TRT) with a diet comprising corn with an increased RS content by heating-cooling and chicken meal. All dogs in the CON and TRT groups were fed a 1.2-fold higher energy diet than the daily recommended energy requirement for 16 weeks. Throughout the study period, the body weight of dogs in CON increased, whereas no change in body weight was observed in TRT, resulting in a significant difference in body weight between the two groups at the end of the experiment. Moreover, a significant reduction in the apparent total tract digestibility was observed upon the analysis of dry matter, nitrogen-free extract, and organic matter in TRT compared with that in CON. The complete blood cell composition and biochemical parameters were within the reference range in both groups. A significant increase in the concentration of serum adiponectin was found in TRT at the end of the experiment. These results suggest that the corn RS may be beneficial for weight management owing to its reduced nutrient digestibility."

The influence of resistant starch on intestinal physiological function has drawn great attention. In this study, we first analyzed the physicochemical characteristics, including the crystalline properties, amylose content, and anti-digestibility among different types of buckwheat-resistant starch. The influence of resistant starch on the physiological functions of the mouse intestinal system, contained defecation, and intestinal microbes were also evaluated. The results showed that the crystalline mold of buckwheat-resistant starch changed from A to B + V after acid hydrolysis treatment (AHT) and autoclaving enzymatic debranching treatment (AEDT). The amylose content in AEDT was higher than in AHT and raw buckwheat. Moreover, the anti-digestibility of AEDT was also stronger than that in AHT and raw buckwheat. The buckwheat-resistant starch can promote bowel intestinal tract movement. The quantity of intestinal microbe was regulated by buckwheat-resistant starch. Our research demonstrates an effective preparation method for improving the quality of buckwheat-resistant starch and found that buckwheat-resistant starch has the role of adjusting the distribution of the intestinal flora and maintaining the health of the body."

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of heat-moisture treatment (HMT) on RS in cassava and examined its impact on rumen fermentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cassava flour was used as a raw material and used in a randomized block design with four different cycles of HMT as the treatments and four different rumen incubations in vitro as blocks. Treatments included: HMT0: without HMT (control), HMT1: one HMT cycle, HMT2: two HMT cycles, and HMT3: three HMT cycles. Heat-moisture treatment processes were performed at 121°C for 15 min and then freezing at -20°C for 6 h. Analyzed HMT cassava starch characteristics included components, digestibility, and physicochemical properties. In in vitro rumen fermentation studies (48 h incubation) using HMT cassava, digestibility, gas production, methane, fermentation profiles, and microbial population assessments were performed. RESULTS: Heat-moisture treatment significantly reduced (p < 0.05) starch, amylopectin, rapidly digestible starch (RDS), and slowly digestible starch levels. In contrast, amylose, reducing sugars, very RDS, RS, and protein digestion levels were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Additionally, a reduced crystallinity index and an increased amorphous index were observed in starch using Fourier-transform infrared analyses, while a change in crystalline type from type A to type B, along with a reduction in crystallinity degree, was observed in X-ray diffraction analyses. Heat-moisture treatment significantly (p < 0.05) reduced rumen dry matter (DM) degradation, gas production, methane (CH4 for 12 h), volatile fatty acid (VFA), and propionate levels. In addition, acetate, butyrate, and acetate/propionate ratios, as well as population of Streptococcus bovis and Bacteroides were significantly increased (p < 0.05). However, pH, ammonia, and organic matter digestibility were unaffected (p > 0.05) by HMT. CONCLUSION: Cassava HMT altered starch characteristics, significantly increased RS, which appeared to limit rumen digestion activity, decreased rumen DM degradation, gas production, VFAs, and CH4 production for 12 h, but increased S. bovis and Bacteroides levels."

In this article, we performed a meta-analysis of a total of 955 samples of 248 individuals from the seven studies included to compare the gut microbiota of the baseline and the end-point of RS intake. At the end-point, RS intake was related to a lower gut microbial α-diversity and higher relative abundance of Ruminococcus, Agathobacter, Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium, and the functional pathways of the gut microbiota related to the carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and genetic information processing were higher. Different types of resistant starch and different populations led to varied responses on the gut microbiome. The altered gut microbiome may contribute to improve the blood glucose level and insulin resistance, which may be a potential treatment route for diabetes, obesity and other metabolic diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnoses are predicted to reach 643 million by 2030, increasing incidences of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities. Rapidly digestible starch elevates postprandial glycemia and impinges glycemic homeostasis, elevating the risk of developing T2D. Starch can escape digestion by endogenous enzymes in the small intestine when protected by intact plant cell walls (resistant starch type 1), when there is a high concentration of amylose (resistant starch type 2) and when the molecule undergoes retrogradation (resistant starch type 3) or chemical modification (resistant starch type 4). Dietary interventions using resistant starch may improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However, few studies have explored the differential effects of resistant starch type. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare the effects of the resistant starch from intact plant cell structures (resistant starch type 1) and resistant starch from modified starch molecules (resistant starch types 2-5) on fasting and postprandial glycemia in subjects with T2D and prediabetes. METHODS: Databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Web of Science) were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials. Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined using random-effects models. Sub-group analyses were conducted between subjects with T2D versus prediabetes and types of resistant starch. RESULTS: The search identified 36 randomized controlled trials (n = 982), 31 of which could be included in the meta-analysis. Resistant starch type 1 and type 2 lowered acute postprandial blood glucose [SMD (95% CI) = -0.54 (-1.0, -0.07)] and [-0.96 (-1.61, -0.31)]. Resistant starch type 2 improved acute postprandial insulin response [-0.71 (-1.31, -0.11)]. In chronic studies, resistant starch type 1 and 2 lowered postprandial glucose [-0.38 (-0.73, -0.02), -0.29 (-0.53, -0.04), respectively] and resistant starch type 2 intake improved fasting glucose [-0.39 (-0.66, -0.13)] and insulin [-0.40 (-0.60, -0.21)]. CONCLUSION: Resistant starch types 1 and 2 may influence glucose homeostasis via discrete mechanisms, as they appear to influence glycemia differently. Further research into resistant starch types 3, 4, and 5 is required to elucidate their effect on glucose metabolism. The addition of resistant starch as a dietary intervention for those with T2D or prediabetes may prevent further deterioration of glycemic control."

Factors predicting the response to RS are not yet established and would be useful for developing precision nutrition approaches that maximize the benefits of dietary fiber intake. We sought to identify predictors of gut microbiota response to RS supplementation. We enrolled 76 healthy adults into a seven-week crossover study. Participants consumed RS type 2 (RS2), RS type 4 (RS4), and a digestible starch, for ten days each with five-day washout periods in between. We collected fecal and saliva samples and food records before and during each treatment period. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and measured fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), salivary amylase gene copy number, and salivary amylase activity (SAA). Dietary fiber intake was predictive of relative abundance of several amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at the end of both RS treatments. Treatment order (the order of consumption of RS2 and RS4), alpha diversity, and a subset of ASVs were predictive of SCFA changes after RS supplementation. SAA was only predictive of the relative abundance of ASVs after digestible starch supplementation. Based on our findings, dietary fiber intake and gut microbiome composition would be informative if assessed prior to recommending RS supplementation. Using a precision nutrition approach to optimize the benefits of dietary fibers such as RS could be an effective strategy to compensate for the low consumption of dietary fiber nationwide."

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is closely associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier dysfunction. Prebiotic intervention could modulate the intestinal microbiota, thus considered a practical strategy for neurological disorders. Puerariae Lobatae Radix-resistant starch (PLR-RS) is a potential novel prebiotic; however, its role in ischemic stroke remains unknown. This study aimed to clarify the effects and underlying mechanisms of PLR-RS in ischemic stroke. Middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery was performed to establish a model of ischemic stroke in rats. After gavage for 14 days, PLR-RS attenuated ischemic stroke-induced brain impairment and gut barrier dysfunction. Moreover, PLR-RS rescued gut microbiota dysbiosis and enriched Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium. We transplanted the fecal microbiota from PLR-RS-treated rats into rats with ischemic stroke and found that the brain and colon damage were also ameliorated. Notably, we found that PLR-RS promoted the gut microbiota to produce a higher level of melatonin. Intriguingly, exogenous gavage of melatonin attenuated ischemic stroke injury. In particular, melatonin attenuated brain impairment via a positive co-occurrence pattern in the intestinal microecology. Specific beneficial bacteria served as leaders or keystone species to promoted gut homeostasis, such as Enterobacter, Bacteroidales_S24-7_group, Prevotella_9, Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, this new underlying mechanism could explain that the therapeutic efficacy of PLR-RS on ischemic stroke at least partly attributed to gut microbiota-derived melatonin. In summary, improving intestinal microecology by prebiotic intervention and melatonin supplementation in the gut were found to be effective therapies for ischemic stroke.",

Recently, the gut microbiome-immune axis has been considered as a promising target to reduce the symptoms of food allergy. In this study, we explore the oral administration of lotus-seed resistant starch as a means to protect against food allergy using an ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and challenge rodent model. The results obtained showed that lotus-seed resistant starch intervention alleviated the food allergy symptoms (such as reductions in body temperature and allergic diarrhea). Furthermore, lotus-seed resistant starch also attenuated the increase in OVA-specific immunoglobulins and improved Th1/Th2 imbalance in OVA-sensitized mice. These anti-allergic effects might be associated with the actions of lotus-seed resistant starch on intestinal microbiota. Taken together, our findings suggest that daily ingestion of lotus-seed resistant starch might be effective for the alleviation of food allergy."

The branch chains of waxy corn starch were continuously elongated by amylosucrase, and the retrogradation of elongated starches with weight-average chain length (CLw¯) of 27.0-37.6 yielded B-type retrograded starches (MSs) with crystallinity increasing from 33.1 % (MS-5) to 41.4 % (MS-30). Increasing the starch crystallinity improved the content of RS from 6.7 % of MS-5 to be as much as 41.0 % of MS-30. During the hydrothermal treatment, MS-5 with CLw¯ of 27.0 favored the B → A allomorphic transition, leading to the decreased starch digestibility. Moreover, the hydrothermal treatment facilitated the assembly of double helices to increase starch crystallinity, which further increased the content of RS. The findings of the present study may assist the preparation of functional starches with controllable digestibility.",

However, the potential of local Sarawak sago RS in regulating glucose has not been extensively studied. Objectives: This study aims to identify glucose-lowering effects of Sarawak sago RS, namely native (RS2) and chemically modified (RS4). Methodology: An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed before and after 1 month treatment with sago RS2 and RS4 in spontaneously type 2 diabetes (T2D), Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat. The mechanisms involved were further explored by screening the in vitro inhibitory activities of α-glucosidase and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV. Histopathology examination for pancreas, kidney and liver tissues was done in response to sago RS intake using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Results and discussion: The incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for blood glucose in RS-treated groups was decreased and significant in RS2-treated group (p < 0.05). Improved iAUC for insulin and higher glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) levels were observed in all RS-treated groups (p < 0.05). Both sago RS may have potential roles in regulating glucose via α- glucosidase and DPP-IV inhibitory activities by reducing intestinal glucose absorption. For histopathology, although insignificant, sago RS2 and RS4 attenuated lesion scores of pancreatic tissue whereas the liver and kidney tissues significantly showed lesser lesion scores compared to the control diabetic group suggesting the potential of RS in reducing cell degeneration. Conclusion: Findings of this study indicates that RS2 showed greater glucose-lowering effect when compared to RS4, thus the therapeutic potential in the T2D management should be further explored.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal hyperpermeability and subsequent immune activation alters nutrient partitioning and thus, decreases productivity. Developing experimental models of intestinal barrier dysfunction in heathy cows is a prerequisite in identifying nutritional strategies to mitigate it. Six cannulated Holstein cows (mean ± standard deviation, 37 ± 10 kg/d milk yield; 219 ± 97 d in milk; 691 ± 70 kg body weight) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design experiment with 21-d periods (16-d wash-out and 5-d challenge) to evaluate either feed restriction or hindgut acidosis as potential models for inducing intestinal hyperpermeability. Cows were randomly assigned to treatment sequence within square and treatment sequences were balanced for carryover effects. Treatments during the challenge were (1) control (CTR; ad libitum feeding); (2) feed restriction (FR; total mixed ration fed at 50% of ad libitum feed intake); and (3) resistant starch (RS; 500 g of resistant starch infused in abomasum once a day as a pulse-dose 30 min before morning feeding). The RS (ActiStar RT 75330, Cargill Inc.) was tapioca starch that was expected to be resistant to enzymatic digestion in the small intestine and highly fermentable in the hindgut. Blood samples were collected 4 h after feeding on d 13 and 14 of the wash-out periods (baseline data used as covariate), and on d 1, 3, and 5 of the challenge periods. Fecal samples were collected 4 and 8 h after the morning feeding on d 14 of the wash-out periods and d 5 of the challenge periods. By design, FR decreased dry matter intake (48%) relative to CTR and RS, and this resulted in marked reductions in milk and 3.5% FCM yields over time, with the most pronounced decrease occurring on d 5 of the challenge (34 and 27%, respectively). Further, FR increased somatic cell count by 115% on d 5 of the challenge relative to CTR and RS. Overall, FR increased nonesterified fatty acids (159 vs. 79 mEq/L) and decreased BHB (8.5 vs. 11.2 mg/dL), but did not change circulating glucose relative to CTR. However, RS had no effect on production or metabolism metrics. Resistant starch decreased fecal pH 8 h after the morning feeding (6.26 vs. 6.81) relative to CTR and FR. Further, RS increased circulating lipopolysaccharide binding protein (4.26 vs. 2.74 µg/mL) compared with FR only on d 1 of the challenge. Resistant starch also increased Hp (1.52 vs. 0.48 µg/mL) compared with CTR, but only on d 5 of the challenge. However, neither RS or FR affected concentrations of serum amyloid A, IL1β, or circulating endotoxin compared with CTR. The lack of consistent responses in inflammatory biomarkers suggests that FR and RS did not meaningfully affect intestinal barrier function. Thus, future research evaluating the effects of hindgut acidosis and FR using more intense insults and direct metrics of intestinal barrier function is warranted.",

The effect of enzymatic combined with autoclaving-cooling cycles (one, two, or three times) on the physicochemical and structural properties of black Tartary buckwheat type 3 resistant starch (BRS) was evaluated. The autoclaving-cooling cycles enhanced solubility and reduced swelling, with the BRS content increasing from 14.12% to 25.18%. The high crystallinity of the BRS reflected a high molecular order. However, increasing the number of autoclaving-cooling cycles did not result in higher BRS content. The highest BRS yield in the autoclaved starch samples was 25.18% after double-autoclaving-cooling cycles. Furthermore, the autoclaving-cooling cycles altered the crystalline structure of black Tartary buckwheat, and the subsequent crystallinity changed from 36.33% to 42.05% to 38.27%. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy shows that the number of cycles results in more efficient double-helical packing within the crystalline lamella. Principal component analysis showed that the autoclaving-cooling cycle treatment leads to significant changes in the molecular structure of resistant starch (RS). These results indicated that autoclaving-cooling cycles might be a feasible way for producing RS from black Tartary buckwheat starch with better structural stability to expand their application range.",

To achieve this, we prepared type 3 resistant starch (RS3) from native potato starch (PS) using an ultrasonic method combined with autoclave gelatinization and optimized by the response surface method to study the structure and properties of potato RS3 (PRS3) and its effect on the quality of steamed bread. Under optimal treatment conditions, the PRS3 content increased from 7.5% to 15.9%. Compared with PS, the B-type crystal structure of PRS3 was destroyed, and the content of hydroxyl groups was increased, but no new chemical groups were introduced. PRS3 had a rougher surface and a lower crystallinity, gelatinization temperature, viscosity, setback value, and breakdown value. The low content (5%) of PRS3 had a stable viscosity and was easily degraded by bacteria, which can improve the quality of steamed bread to a certain extent. When the PRS3 content was over 10%, it competed with the gluten protein to absorb water, which reduced the contents of β-turn and α-helix in the dough, increased the contents of β-fold, and weakened the structure of the gluten network. It also decreased the specific volume and elasticity of the steamed bread and increased the spreading rate, hardness, and chewiness. Steamed bread prepared with a flour mixture containing 5% PRS3 was similar to the presidential acceptance of control flour. In this study, a new sustainable and efficient PRS3 preparation method was established, which has certain guiding significance for the processing of Functional steamed bread with high-resistant starch.",

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of MT wheat starch displayed a distinct carbonyl peak at around 1,740 cm-1, is formed due to the stretching vibration of the CO bond of the ester group. The crystalline and double-helix structures of the MT wheat starch were extensively destroyed, resulting in its enhanced degree of substitution, number of cross-linking bonds, and thermostable RS content (99 %) as well as its reduced viscosity. Furthermore, its consumption in vivo reduced the blood glucose level and response.

It has been shown to reduce obese-related kidney dysfunction in animal models. This study aimed to investigate the effect of resistant starch from BR (RS) on renal inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in obese insulin resistant rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into six groups: normal diet (ND), ND treated with 150 mg of RS (NDRS150), high-fat (HF) diet, HF treated with 100 and 150 mg of RS (HFRS100), (HFRS150), and HF treated with metformin as a positive control. Insulin resistance was shown in the HF rats by glucose intolerance, increased insulin, total area under the curve of glucose and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. The resulting metabolic disturbance in the HF rats caused renal inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis progressing to kidney injury and dysfunction. Prebiotic RS including anthocyanin from BR at doses of 100 and 150 mg ameliorated insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and liver injury. Treatment with RS reduced TGF-β fibrotic and apoptotic pathways by inhibition of NF-κB and inflammatory cytokines which potentially restore kidney damage and dysfunction. In conclusion, prebiotic RS from BR ameliorated obesity induced renal injury and dysfunction by attenuating inflammatory, fibrotic, and apoptotic pathways in insulin resistant rats induced by HF.",

Resistant starch (RS) is a dietary fibre that alters the gut microbial consortium, leading to an increase in the microbial production of short chain fatty acids. Evidence from animal and human studies indicate that short chain fatty acids are able to attenuate inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, which may mitigate the progression of DKD.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resistant starch (RS) type 4 (RS4) is a type of RS, a class of non-digestible prebiotic dietary fibers with a range of demonstrated metabolic health benefits to the host. On the other hand, bile acids (BA) have recently emerged as an important class of metabolic function mediators that involve host-microbiota interactions. RS consumption alters fecal and cecal BA in humans and rodents, respectively. The effect of RS intake on circulating BA concentrations remains unexplored in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using available plasma and stool samples from our previously reported double-blind, controlled, 2-arm crossover nutrition intervention trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01887964), a liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry-based targeted multiple reaction monitoring, and absolute quantifications, we assessed BA changes after 12 weeks of an average 12 g/day RS4-intake. Stool BA concentrations were lower post RS4 compared to the control, the two groups consuming similar macronutrients (n = 14/group). Partial least squares-discriminant analysis revealed distinct BA signatures in stool and plasma post interventions. The increased circulating BA concentrations were further investigated using linear mixed-effect modeling that controlled for potential confounders. A higher plasma abundance of several BA species post RS4 was observed (fold increase compared to control in parenthesis): taurocholic acid (1.92), taurodeoxycholic acid (1.60), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (1.58), glycodeoxycholic acid (1.79), and deoxycholic acid (1.77) (all, p < 0.05). Distinct microbiome ortholog-signatures were observed between RS4 and control groups (95% CI), derived using the Piphillin function-prediction algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) of pre-existing 16S rRNA gene sequences. Association of Bifidobacterium adolescentis with secondary BA such as, deoxycholic acid (rho = 0.55, p = 0.05), glycodeoxycholic acid (rho = 0.65, p = 0.02), and taurodeoxycholic acid (rho = 0.56, p = 0.04) were observed in the RS4-group, but not in the control group (all, p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our observations indicate a previously unknown in humans- RS4-associated systemic alteration of microbiota-derived secondary BA. Follow-up investigations of BA biosynthesis in the context of RS4 may provide molecular targets to understand and manipulate microbiome-host interactions."

Resistant starch (RS) has been known as a kind of promising dietary fiber for the prevention or treatment of diabetes. Therefore, it has become a hot topic to explore the hypoglycemic mechanisms of RS. In this review, the mechanisms have been summarized, according to the relevant studies in the recent 15 years. In general, the blood glucose could be regulated by RS by regulating the intestinal microbiota disorder, resisting digestion, reducing inflammation, regulating the hypoglycemic related enzymes and some other mechanisms. Although the exact mechanisms of the beneficial effects of RS have not been fully verified, it is indicated that RS can be used as a daily dietary intervention to reduce the risk of diabetes in different ways. In addition, further research on hypoglycemic mechanisms of RS impacted by the RS categories, the different experimental animals and various dietary habits of human subjects, have also been discussed in this review.",

The utilization of banana peels for the extraction of resistant starch can be a valuable strategy of waste valorization with economic viability at the industrial level. Green techniques like ultrasound can be efficacious in terms of increasing the extraction efficiency and yield of resistant starch. In this study, ultrasound assisted enzymatic extraction of resistant starch was optimized using response surface methodology. The optimum yield (60.6%) of resistant starch was obtained at 35 °C temperature, 30:1 liquid to solid ratio after a treatment time of 9 min. The results showed that a combination of ultrasound treatment with enzymatic extraction of resistant starch can be an efficient approach for the valorization of banana peels. Resistant starch holds application as a valuable supplement in functional food development in the fields of dairy, bakery, beverages, etc."

Upon HMT, the RS content increased from 32.1% for native starch to 46.4% in HMT starch with optimized condition. HMT of the starches reduced the solubility and swelling power. The surface of HMT starch granules was more irregular than native starch. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak intensity at 2θ = 5° was greatly reduced by HMT, and the peaks at 22.7° and 24.2° were merged. HMT increased the gelatinization temperature and reduced the gelatinization enthalpy.

The effect of US cavitation at different temperatures on the morphology, physicochemical properties, and mechanical performance of RS was evaluated. Ultrasonication at 40−70 °C temperatures affected the chemical structure, reduced the crystallinity of RS from 23.85% to between 18.37 and 4.43%, and increased the mechanical and thermal stability of RS pastes, indicating a higher tendency to retrograde. US treatment significantly (p < 0.05) improved the oil (OAC) and water (WAC) absorption capacities, swelling power (SP), solubility (WS), and reduced the least-gelation concentration (LGC). The mathematical evaluation of the data indicated a significant effect (p < 0.05) of the US parameters on the production of RS. The largest increment of RS (13.46 g/100 g dw) was achieved with US cavitation at 1.8 W/cm2 power, 40.2 °C temperature, and 18 min of processing time. The developed method and technology bring low-temperature US processing of rice milling waste to create a new sustainable food system based on modified rice bran biopolymers."

Further comparison between the BUN and the noodle prepared with untreated oat and buckwheat showed that, the pre-baking-steaming of oat not only produced a more extended and thermally stable protein network involving rearranged gluten and oat globulins in cooked BUN, but also enhanced the short-range molecular order of gelatinized starch through the formation of nascent double helixes and binary/ternary complexes (starch-lipid, starch-protein and starch-lipid-protein). Overall, these stronger macromolecular interactions in cooked BUN led to an extensive and compact protein-starch network that promoted the formation of more resistant starch (41%). Our findings elucidated the molecular mechanism that underpin the positive effect of oat pretreatment on noodle quality and digestibility.",

Here, the effects of resistant starch from raw potato starch (RPS), a type of prebiotic, on E. coli-induced bone loss and gut microbial composition in meat ducks were evaluated. RESULTS: The results showed that dietary 12% RPS treatment improved bone quality, depressed bone resorption, and attenuated the pro-inflammatory reaction in both ileum and bone marrow. Meanwhile, the 12% RPS diet also increased the abundance of Firmicutes in E. coli-treated birds, along with higher production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) especially propionate and butyrate. Whereas addition of β-acid, an inhibitor of bacterial SCFAs production, to the drinking water of ducks fed 12% RPS diet significantly decreased SCFAs level in cecum content and eliminated RPS-induced tibial mass improvement. Further, treatment with MI-2 to abrogate mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (Malt1) activity replicated the protective role of dietary 12% RPS in E. coli-induced bone loss including reduced the inhibition on nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) inflammasome activation, decreased bone resorption, and improved bone quality, which were correlated with comparable and higher regulatory T cells (Treg) frequency in MI-2 and 12% RPS group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that the diet with 12% RPS could alleviate E. coli-induced bone loss in meat ducks by changing the gut microbial composition and promoting concomitant SCFAs production, and consequently inhibiting Malt1/NF-κB inflammasome activation and Treg cells expansion."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resistant starches (RSs) are not digested by human digestive enzymes and pass through the upper digestive tract to become substrates for colonic bacteria. Resistant starch supplementation has shown promising results in altering the microbiota of animal models of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Resistant starch consumption may influence the production of uremic toxins in CKD. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review to determine whether the consumption of RS reduces the progression of kidney disease in adult patients with CKD. DESIGN: We included randomized controlled trials comparing RS supplementation to placebo, no treatment, or standard care. Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases were searched. There was no limitation on publication date, but only English manuscripts were included. The search was conducted in July 2020. PATIENTS: Adult outpatient populations with CKD, using any recognized diagnostic criteria. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from baseline through the end of the trial in patients not on dialysis; secondary outcomes included change in uremic toxin concentrations (p-cresol/p-cresyl sulfate [p-CS], indoxyl sulfate [IS]) and inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6 [IL-6]) from baseline through the end of the trial, and changes in self-reported symptom scores. METHODS: The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool was used to assess risk of bias in included studies. The systematic review results are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. RESULTS: We identified 4 unique studies, reported in 9 publications that met our inclusion criteria, including a total of 215 enrolled participants. Results were calculated using data from the longest reported follow-up time. The primary outcome of changes in kidney function markers was only studied in 1 trial; this trial reported an increase in creatinine and a decrease in blood urea nitrogen; no changes in GFR were reported. A review of the secondary outcomes showed an overall decline in IS, TNF-α, and IL-6, in RS groups, but with mixed results in p-CS and CRP/high-sensitivity CRP. Safety data showed that RS was well tolerated with no reports of excessive side effects. LIMITATIONS: We determined a meta-analysis was not feasible due to clinical heterogeneity between study populations and differences in reported outcomes in the included studies. CONCLUSION: There is limited and inconsistent evidence on the impact of RS in adult patients with CKD. Further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of RS supplementation in this population."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consumption of resistant starch (RS) has been associated with various intestinal and systemic health benefits, but knowledge of its effects on intestinal health and inflammatory response in stressed birds is limited. Here, we examined how dietary RS supplementation from 12% raw potato starch (RPS) modulated inflammatory severity induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in meat ducks. RESULTS: LPS administration at 14, 16, and 18 d (chronic challenge) decreased body weight (BW) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) level with higher intestinal permeability and inflammation, evident by higher pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Dietary 12% RPS supplementation enhanced Claudin-1 and GLP-1R expression, along with lower levels of inflammatory factors in both ileum and serum. Microbiome analysis showed that RS treatment shifted microbial structure reflected by enriched the proportion of Firmicutes, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, etc. Dietary RS addition also significantly increased the concentrations of propionate and butyrate during chronic LPS challenge. Furthermore, response to acute challenge, the ducks received 2 mg/kg BW LPS at 14 d had higher concentrations of serum endotoxins and inflammatory cytokines, as well as upregulated transcription of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) in ileum when compared to control birds. Analogous to GLP-1 agonist liraglutide, dietary RS addition decreased endotoxins and inflammation cytokines, whereas it upregulated the GLP-1 synthesis related genes expression. Meanwhile, dietary RS supplementation suppressed the acute LPS challenge-induced TLR4 transcription. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that dietary 12% RPS supplementation could attenuate the LPS-induced inflammation as well as intestinal injury of meat ducks, which might involve in the alteration in gut microbiota, SCFAs production and the signaling pathways of TLR4 and GLP-1/GLP-1R."

The accuracy and precision of the in vitro analysis was assessed from its ability to concurrently predict clinical GI. In porridges, kernel intactness and lack of cooking reduced GI while increasing Type 1 (inaccessible) and Type 2 (ungelatinised) resistant starch. Porridge in vitro GI values (GIiv), calculated from the area under in vitro digestion curves minus estimated blood glucose disposal, were: raw fine, 26.3; raw kibbled, 12.6; cooked fine, 63.9; cooked kibbled, 44.1; and correlated closely with clinical GI values (R2 = 0.97). In bread, the negative association of kernel intactness and resistant starch with GI was seen in vitro but not in vivo. Bread GIiv values were: roller milled flour, 67.4; stoneground flour 61.1; kibbled grain, 53.0; kibbled + intact kernel, 49.5; but correlation with clinical values was low (R2 = 0.47), and variability in the clinical results was high (clinical CV = 72.5%, in vitro CV = 3.7%). Low glycaemic potency of wheat by minimal processing was achieved by maintaining particle size, avoiding hydrothermal treatment, avoiding crushing and using a food matrix requiring little chewing for ingestion. Use of in vitro digestive analysis for high precision measurement of starch fractions with potential secondary health benefits was validated by accurate concurrent prediction of the glycaemic index but needed to account for effects of chewing."

This study evaluated in vitro photodynamic therapy of methylene blue (MB)-loaded acetyl resistant starch (ARS) nanoparticles (NPs). METHODS: ARS was synthesized by the reaction between resistant starch (RS) and acetic anhydride. MB-loaded ARS NPs and ARS NPs were prepared by a single emulsion method. Synthesized ARS was measured by NMR. Prepared ARS NPs and MB-loaded ARS NPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction, UV/Vis, and circular dichroism (CD). MB-loaded ARS NPs were treated in mouse colon cancer cells (CT-26) and they were treated under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. RESULTS: Synthesis of ARS was confirmed by NMR and the degree of substitutions in the ARS was 7.1. The morphologies of ARS NPs observed by TEM were spherical shapes and the particle sizes of ARS NPs were 173.4 nm with a surface charge of - 17.24 mV. The d-spacing of ARS NPs was smaller than those of RS and the conformational changes of RS occurred by the formation of self-assembled polymeric NPs with induction of CD of the MB by chiral ARS NPs. The phototoxicity of CT-26 cells treated by MB-loaded ARS NPs dramatically decreased in a dose-dependent manner under NIR laser irradiation compared to free MB. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the ordered nanosized structures in the ARS NPs and conformational change from random coil structure of RS to alpha-helices one of ARS occurred and CD of the achiral MB was induced. The MB-loaded ARS NPs showed a higher generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the CT-26 cells than free MB with the NIR laser irradiation and resulting in phototoxicity under irradiation."

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome with a global prevalence. Impaired gut barrier function caused by an unhealthy diet plays a key role in disrupting the immune-metabolic homeostasis of the gut-liver axis (GLA), leading to NAFLD. Therefore, dietary interventions have been studied as feasible alternative therapeutic approaches to ameliorate NAFLD. Resistant starches (RSs) are prebiotics that reduce systemic inflammation in patients with metabolic syndrome. The present review aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of the GLA in alleviating NAFLD and provide insights into how dietary RSs counteract diet-induced inflammation in the GLA. Emerging evidence suggests that RS intake alters gut microbiota structure, enhances mucosal immune tolerance, and promotes the production of microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and secondary bile acids. These metabolites directly stimulate the growth of intestinal epithelial cells and elicit GPR41/GPR43, FXR, and TGR5 signaling cascades to sustain immune-metabolic homeostasis in the GLA. The literature also revealed the dietary-immune-metabolic interplay by which RSs exert their regulatory effect on the immune-metabolic crosstalk of the GLA and the related molecular basis, suggesting that dietary intervention with RSs may be a promising alternative therapeutic strategy against diet-induced dysfunction of the GLA and, ultimately, the risk of developing NAFLD."

      "abstract": "Accumulating attention has been focused on resistant starch (RS) due to its blood-lipid-lowering activities. However, reports on the potential bioactivities of RS for preventing hyperlipidemia acute pancreatitis (HLAP) are limited. Therefore, in this study, an acute pancreatitis model was set up by feeding a hyperlipidemia diet to rats, and subsequently evaluating the anti-HLAP effect of RS in kidney beans. The results show that the IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α of serum in each RS group were decreased by 18.67-50.00%, 7.92-22.89%, and 8.06-34.04%, respectively, compared with the model group (MOD). In addition, the mRNA expression of tight junction protein ZO-1, occludin, and antibacterial peptides CRAMP and DEFB1 of rats in each RS group increased by 26.43-60.07%, 229.98-279.90%, 75.80-111.20%, and 77.86-109.07%, respectively. The height of the villi in the small intestine and the thickness of the muscle layer of rats were also increased, while the depth of the crypt decreased. The present study indicates that RS relieves intestinal inflammation, inhibits oxidative stress, and prevents related intestinal barrier damage. These results support the supplementation of RS as an effective nutritional intervention for HLAP and associated intestinal injury.",

Although potatoes are suggested to adversely affect cardiometabolic health, controlled trials that can establish causality are limited. Consistent with potatoes being rich in micronutrients and resistant starch, we hypothesized that their inclusion in a Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)-based dietary pattern would improve cardiometabolic and gut health in metabolic syndrome (MetS) persons. In a randomized cross-over trial, MetS persons (n = 27; 32.5 ± 1.3 year) consumed a DGA-based diet for 2 weeks containing potatoes (DGA + POTATO; 17.5 g/day resistant starch) or bagels (DGA + BAGEL; 0 g/day resistant starch) prior to completing oral glucose and gut permeability tests. Blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, and insulin resistance decreased (p < 0.05) from baseline regardless of treatment without any change in body mass. Oral glucose-induced changes in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, nitric oxide homeostasis, and lipid peroxidation did not differ between treatment arms. Serum endotoxin AUC0−120 min and urinary lactulose/mannitol, but not urinary sucralose/erythritol, were lower in DGA + POTATO. Fecal microbiome showed limited between-treatment differences, but the proportion of acetate was higher in DGA + POTATO. Thus, short-term consumption of a DGA-based diet decreases cardiometabolic risk, and the incorporation of resistant starch-containing potatoes into a healthy diet reduces small intestinal permeability and postprandial endotoxemia.",

The degree of order/degree of double helix in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was in the following order: CC-RS > UC-RS > CC-S > UC-S, which was consistent with the trend observed for relative crystallinity and double helix contents monitored by X-ray diffractometer and solid-state 13C cross-polarization and magic angle spinning NMR analyses. The influence of different types of chickpea starch and their corresponding resistant starch fractions on regulating the serum lipid profile, antioxidant status, and histopathological changes in liver, colon and cecal tissues, and gene expressions associated with lipid metabolism, gut microbiota, as well as short-chain fatty acid metabolites in mice with high fat diet induced obesity was investigated. The results showed that the chickpea RS diet group exhibited overall better anti-hyperlipidemic and ameliorative effects than those of the starch group, and such effects were most pronounced in the CC-RS intervention group. After a six-week period of administration with chickpea starch and RS diets, mice in the UC-RS and CC-RS groups tended to have relatively significantly higher levels (P < 0.05) of butyric acid in their fecal contents. The 16S rRNA sequencing results revealed that mice fed with CC-RS showed the greatest abundance of Akkermansia and Lactobacillus compared with the other groups.",

Therefore, the most effective treatment of CD is a life-long gluten-free diet. This study aimed to produce a nutritious gluten-free cinnamon roll, where resistant starch and lupine flour were used instead of wheat flour, in addition to 10% flaxseed flour and a fixed amount of hydrocolloid (1% xanthan gum). Eight different gluten-free cinnamon roll treatments (T1-T8) were produced with different ratios of resistant starch and lupine flour according to the following percentages (85:5, 80:10, 75:15, 70:20, 65:25, 60:30, 55:35 and 50:40, respectively). The proximate analysis, physical properties, color measurements and sensory evaluation of all cinnamon roll treatments and flours were determined. It was found that lupine and flaxseed flours in all different treatments had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher levels of ash, protein, lipid and crude fiber compared to wheat flour treatment (control treatment). However, carbohydrate levels were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher in control treatment compared with treatments 3-8. Gluten-free cinnamon rolls had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid) than control. Further, there were significant differences in lightness (L*), redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) color values between the gluten-free and control treatments. The control cinnamon roll significantly (p ≤ 0.05) had the highest level of lightness and the lowest level of redness. The sensory evaluation obtained by consumer evaluation indicated that control cinnamon rolls significantly (p ≤ 0.05) received the highest score in overall impression, overall flavor, hardness and aftertaste. However, treatment 5 significantly (p ≤ 0.05) received the highest score in all the sensory scores in comparison with other gluten-free treatments. It is possible to develop a quality gluten-free cinnamon roll with respect to nutritional value manifested in higher levels of protein, fibers, unsaturated acids and prebiotics with acceptable sensory attributes."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and eating quality of salted noodles that are incorporated with different formulations of flour. Up to 20% of wheat flour was substituted by composite flours of highly resistant starches, including heat moisture treatment corn starch (HMT-CS), high-amylose corn starch (Hylon VII), and green banana flour (GBF). The physical properties of dough, in conjunction with the eating quality and estimated glycemic index (EGI) of cooked salted noodles, were investigated in this study. The results concluded that the incorporation of GBF, HMT, and Hylon VII not only affected the water absorption and mixing tolerance of the dough, but also the maximum resistance to extension and extensibility in terms of the extensographic properties. Meanwhile, GBF, HMT, and Hylon VII incorporation significantly increased the resistant starch content and decreased the fat content of the noodle samples. The textural profile analyses of cooked salted noodles indicated that hardness, gumminess, chewiness, and shearing force increased; nevertheless, springiness declined with the increase in the proportion of flours from 10 to 20%. The sensory evaluation detected that wheat flour composited with 10% GBF and HMT flours could produce acceptable quality noodles as compared with normal typical control noodles. In the meantime, salted noodles incorporated with GBF, HMT-CS, and Hylon VII flour decreased the estimated glycemic index (EGI) dramatically. The result of this study concluded that incorporation of various sources of resistant starch flour could develop a low-GI noodle with good acceptability that may contribute to gastrointestinal health."

Malic acid treatment decreased the frequency of cracks within the rice kernel. The color (lightness) was significantly affected by the immersion time, reflecting the browning of rice. The degree of substitution gradually increased with the immersion time and reached a plateau after 12 h, and the intensity of the C=O bond peak detected in the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed a similar trend. However, the crystallinity of rice decreased as the immersion time increased, which was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction and thermal transition properties. A gradual increase in RS was observed as the immersion time and DS increased, ranging from 44.5% to 73.3%, reaching a maximum after 12 h of immersion. Therefore, 12 h was determined to be the optimal immersion time for maximizing RS content. This information about the structural characteristics and heat-stable properties of malic acid-treated rice in starch digestion can be used to develop a low-digestible food ingredient and lead to further application of the study. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study reported the preparation and physicochemical properties of malic acid-treated resistant starch with different immersion times.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resistant starch (RS) confers many health benefits, mostly through the microbial production of SCFAs, but foods containing appreciable RS are limited. High-amylose wheat (HAW) is high in RS and lowers the glycemic response of foods, but whether it can improve gastrointestinal health measures is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether daily consumption of HAW food products improved markers of gastrointestinal health in healthy men and women compared with similar foods made from conventional wheat. METHODS: Eighty healthy adults (47 women and 33 men) were enrolled in a 4-arm parallel, randomized-controlled, double-blind trial. After a 2-wk low-dietary fiber run-in period, they were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 treatment groups: low-amylose wheat (LAW)-refined (LAW-R), LAW-wholemeal (LAW-W), HAW-refined (HAW-R), and HAW-wholemeal (HAW-W) and consumed the assigned test bread (160 g/d) and biscuits (75 g/d) for 4 wk. Fecal biochemical markers were measured at baseline and 4 wk. Microbial abundance and diversity were quantified using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and perceived gut comfort by a semiquantitative questionnaire completed at baseline, 2 wk, and 4 wk. RESULTS: HAW showed similar effects on fecal output and excretion of total SCFA compared with LAW, but changes were observed in secondary measures for the refined treatment groups. At 4 wk, the HAW-R group had 38% higher fecal butyrate excretion than the LAW-R group (P < 0.05), and higher fecal SCFA-producing bacteria, Roseburia inulinivorans (P < 0.001), than at baseline. In comparison with baseline, LAW-R increased fecal p-cresol concentration, and fecal abundance of a p-cresol-producing bacterium, Clostridium from the Peptostreptococcaceae family, but both were reduced by HAW-R. Amylose level did not affect measures of fecal consistency or adversely affecting digestive comfort. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing RS intake of healthy adults by substituting refined conventional wheat with refined HAW modulates fecal metabolites and microbes associated with gastrointestinal health.This trial was registered at anzctr.org.au as ACTRN12618001060235.",

In addition to maintaining a physically active way of life, the diet has become one of the bases in managing TD2M. Due to many studies linking the ability of resistant starch (RS) to a substantial role in enhancing the nutritional quality of food and disease prevention, the challenge of incorporating RS into the diet and increasing its intake remains. Therefore, we conducted this review to assess the potential benefits of RS on metabolic biomarkers in pre-diabetes and diabetes adults based on available intervention studies over the last decade. Based on the conducted review, we observed that RS intake correlates directly to minimize possible effects through different mechanisms for better control of pre-diabetic and diabetic conditions. In most studies, significant changes were evident in the postprandial glucose and insulin incremental area under the curve (iAUC). Comparative evaluation of RS consumption and control groups also showed differences with inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, and E-selectin. Only RS2 and RS3 were extensively investigated and widely reported among the five reported RS types. However, a proper comparison and conclusion are deemed inappropriate considering the variations observed with the study duration, sample size, subjects and their metabolic conditions, intervention doses, and the intervention base products. In conclusion, this result provides interesting insights into the potential use of RS as part of a sustainable diet in diabetes management and should be further explored in terms of the mechanism involved."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. Accumulation of nitrogen-based uremic toxins leads to worsening of symptoms in individuals with CKD. Many uremic toxins, such as indoxyl and p-cresol sulphate, are produced exclusively by the gut microbiome through the proteolytic digestion of aromatic amino acids. Strategies to reduce the production of these toxins by the gut microbiome in individuals with CKD may lessen symptom burden and delay the onset of dialysis. One such strategy is to change the overall metabolism of the gut microbiome so that less uremic toxins are produced. This can be accomplished by manipulating the energy source available to the microbiome. Fermentable carbohydrates which reach the gut microbiome, like resistant starch (RS), have been shown to inhibit or reduce bacterial amino acid metabolism. This study aims to investigate the effects of resistant potato starch (RPS) as a prebiotic in individuals with CKD before the onset of dialysis. METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized two-period crossover trial. Thirty-six eligible participants will consent to follow a 26-week study regimen. Participants will receive 2 sachets per day containing either 15 g of RPS (MSPrebiotic, resistant potato starch treatment) or 15 g cornstarch (Amioca TF, digestible starch control). Changes in blood uremic toxins will be investigated as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include the effect of RPS consumption on symptoms, quality of life and abundance, and diversity and functionality of the gut microbiome. DISCUSSION: This randomized trial will provide further insight into whether the consumption of RPS as a prebiotic will reduce uremic toxins and symptoms in individuals who have CKD.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is prevalent with lasting health implications for the mother and offspring. Medical nutrition therapy is the foundation of GDM management yet achieving optimal glycaemic control often requires treatment with medications, like insulin. New dietary strategies to improve GDM management and outcomes are required. Gut dysbiosis is a feature of GDM pregnancies, therefore, dietary manipulation of the gut microbiota may offer a new avenue for management. Resistant starch is a fermentable dietary fibre known to alter the gut microbiota and enhance production of short-chain fatty acids. Evidence suggests that short-chain fatty acids improve glycaemia via multiple mechanisms, however, this has not been evaluated in GDM. METHODS: An open-label, parallel-group design study will investigate whether a high dietary resistant starch intake or resistant starch supplement improves glycaemic control and changes the gut microbiome compared with standard dietary advice in women with newly diagnosed GDM. Ninety women will be randomised to one of three groups - standard dietary treatment for GDM (Control), a high resistant starch diet or a high resistant starch diet plus a 16 g resistant starch supplement. Measurements taken at Baseline (24 to 30-weeks' gestation), Day 10 and Day 56 (approximately 36 weeks' gestation) will include fasting plasma glucose levels, microbial composition and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in stool, 3-day dietary intake records and bowel symptoms questionnaires. One-week post-natal data collection will include microbial composition and short-chain fatty acid concentrations of maternal and neonatal stools, microbial composition of breastmilk, birthweight, maternal and neonatal outcomes. Mixed model analysis of variance will assess change in glycaemia and permutation-based multivariate analysis of variance will assess changes in microbial composition within and between intervention groups. Distance-based linear modelling will identify correlation between change in stool microbiota, short-chain fatty acids and measures of glycaemia. DISCUSSION: To improve outcomes for GDM dyads, evaluation of a high dietary intake of resistant starch to improve glycaemia through the gut microbiome needs to be established. This will expand the dietary interventions available to manage GDM without medication. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, ACTRN12620000968976p .

      "abstract": "Glycogen is a complex branched glucose polymer found in many tissues and acts as a blood-glucose buffer. In the liver, smaller β glycogen particles can bind into larger composite α particles. In mouse models of diabetes, these liver glycogen particles are molecularly fragile, breaking up into smaller particles in the presence of solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). If this occurs in vivo, such a rapid enzymatic degradation of these smaller particles into glucose could exacerbate the poor blood-glucose control that is characteristic of the disease. High-amylose resistant starch (RS) can escape digestion in the small intestine and ferment in the large intestine, which elicits positive effects on glycemic response and type 2 diabetes. Here we postulate that RS would help attenuate diabetes-related liver glycogen fragility. Normal maize starch and two types of high-amylose starch were fed to diabetic and non-diabetic mice. Molecular size distributions and chain-length distributions of liver glycogen from both groups were characterized to test glycogen fragility before and after DMSO treatment. Consistent with the hypothesis that high blood glucose is associated with glycogen fragility, a high-amylose RS diet prevented the fragility of liver-glycogen α particles. The diets had no significant effect on the glycogen chain-length distributions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Animal experiments showed that resistant starch (RS) had an antioxidant and antiinflammatory effect. However, clinical studies showed both insignificant and significant effects of RS on inflammation and oxidative stress. The purpose of this work is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate these effects. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A systematic literature search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane electronic databases, which included studies from the earliest date of the database to September 2021. Key inclusion criteria were: RCTs; reporting at least one inflammatory or oxidative stress biomarker as endpoint; more than seven day intervention. Key exclusion criteria were: using a mixture of RS and other functional food ingredients as intervention substance; inappropriate controls. RESULTS: A total of 16 RCTs including 706 subjects were included. RS supplementation significantly improved total antioxidant capacity [standard mean difference (SMD) (95% CI): 2.64 (0.34, 4.94), p=0.03], and significantly reduced blood malondialdehyde concentration [SMD (95% CI): -0.55 (- 0.94, -0.17), p=0.01]. RS supplementation significantly reduced blood C-reactive protein concentration in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients [SMD (95% CI): -0.35 (-0.65, -0.05), p=0.02]. RS consumption significantly reduced blood interlukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor- concentration if removing one distinct trial. CONCLUSIONS: RS supplementation may significantly reduce a few oxidative-stress and inflammation biomarkers such as malondialdehyde and C-reactive protein, particularly in T2DM patients. Future work should investigate the optimal dosage of RS supplementation for modulating oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers related to T2DM.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resistant starches (RSs) have been advocated as a dietary supplement to address microbiota dysbiosis. They are postulated to act through the production of SCFAs. Their clinical tolerability and effect on SCFA production has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review of RS supplementation as an intervention in adults (healthy individuals and persons with medical conditions) participating in randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was tolerability of RS supplementation, the secondary outcome was SCFA production. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register were searched. Articles were screened, and data extracted, independently and in duplicate. RESULTS: A total of 39 trials met eligibility criteria, including a total of 2263 patients. Twenty-seven (69%) studies evaluated the impact of RS supplementation in healthy subjects whereas 12 (31%) studies included individuals with an underlying medical condition (e.g., obesity, prediabetes). Type 2 RS was most frequently investigated (29 studies). Of 12 studies performed in subjects with health conditions, 11 reported on tolerability. All studies showed that RS supplementation was tolerated; 9 of these studies used type 2 RS with doses of 20-40 g/d for >4 wk. Of 27 studies performed in healthy subjects, 20 reported on tolerability. In 14 studies, RS supplementation was tolerated, and the majority used type 2 RS with a dose between 20 and 40 g/d. Twenty-one (78%) studies reporting SCFAs used type 2 RS with a dose of 20-40 g/d for 1-4 wk. In 16 of 23 studies (70%), SCFA production was increased, in 7 studies there was no change in SCFA concentration before and after RS supplementation, and in 1 study SCFA concentration decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests that RS supplementation is tolerated in both healthy subjects and in those with an underlying medical condition. In addition, SCFA production was increased in most of the studies.",

      "abstract": "The composition of the gut microbiota is linked to multiple diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Abundance of bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and fecal SCFA concentrations are reduced in PD. SCFAs exert various beneficial functions in humans. In the interventional, monocentric, open-label clinical trial \"Effects of Resistant Starch on Bowel Habits, Short Chain Fatty Acids and Gut Microbiota in Parkinson'sDisease\" (RESISTA-PD; ID: NCT02784145), we aimed at altering fecal SCFAs by an 8-week prebiotic intervention with resistant starch (RS). We enrolled 87 subjects in three study-arms: 32 PD patients received RS (PD + RS), 30 control subjects received RS, and 25 PD patients received solely dietary instructions. We performed paired-end 100 bp length metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples using the BGISEQ platform at an average of 9.9 GB. RS was well-tolerated. In the PD + RS group, fecal butyrate concentrations increased significantly, and fecal calprotectin concentrations dropped significantly after 8 weeks of RS intervention. Clinically, we observed a reduction in non-motor symptom load in the PD + RS group. The reference-based analysis of metagenomes highlighted stable alpha-diversity and beta-diversity across the three groups, including bacteria producing SCFAs. Reference-free analysis suggested punctual, yet pronounced differences in the metagenomic signature in the PD + RS group. RESISTA-PD highlights that a prebiotic treatment with RS is safe and well-tolerated in PD. The stable alpha-diversity and beta-diversity alongside altered fecal butyrate and calprotectin concentrations call for long-term studies, also investigating whether RS is able to modify the clinical course of PD.",

Recently, various dietary interventions have been used extensively as a novel therapy against PCOS. In the present study, we show that soy isoflavone metabolites and resistant starch, together with gut microbiota modulations, were successful in decreasing the severity of PCOS-like reproductive features while increasing the expression of gut barrier markers and butyric acid in the gut. In the letrozole-induced PCOS model rats, the intake of both 0.05% soy isoflavones and 11% resistant starch, even with letrozole treatment, reduced the severity of menstrual irregularity and polycystic ovaries with a high concentration of soy isoflavones and equol in plasma. Antibiotic cocktail treatment suppressed soy isoflavone metabolism in the gut and showed no considerable effects on reducing the PCOS-like symptoms. The mRNA expression level of occludin significantly increased with soy isoflavone and resistant starch combined treatment. Bacterial genera such as Blautia, Dorea and Clostridium were positively correlated with menstrual irregularity under resistant starch intake. Moreover, the concentration of butyric acid was elevated by resistant starch intake. In conclusion, we propose that both dietary interventions and gut microbiota modulations could be effectively used in reducing the severity of PCOS reproductive features.",

Three identical diets were extruded with high, medium and low shear (HS, MS and LS) to incrementally increase RS, and fed to 24 dogs in a replicated 3 × 3 William's Latin square design for 28-day periods. Fasting blood and fresh feces were collected on the last week of each period. Fecal quality was maintained among treatments. Gut integrity markers were measured by ELISA. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured by LC MS/MS. In addition, the microbiota of dogs was determined from fresh feces by 16s rRNA high throughput sequencing. Untargeted metabolomics of both feces and serum were determined by UPLC. Data were analyzed using mixed models. There were no treatment effects on satiety hormones or gut integrity markers. Dogs fed LS or MS diets had marginal evidence (p < 0.10) for decreased fecal pH and for higher concentration (p < 0.05) of butyric acid and fecal oligosaccharides, succinate and lactate. Also, dogs fed the MS or LS diets had a shift towards more saccharolytic bacteria."
