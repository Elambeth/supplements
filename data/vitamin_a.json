      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin D and Vitamin A are crucial for children's immune function, bone health, and cellular growth, but their interrelationship and the impact of various factors remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between Vitamin D and Vitamin A levels in children and identify any critical thresholds. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from 2018 to 2021 in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China. Participants were children aged 0 to 14 years attending community health service centers for routine health check-ups. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to ascertain the association between serum Vitamin D and Vitamin A levels. A smooth curve fitting approach was employed to analyze the dose-response relationship between Vitamin D and Vitamin A. RESULTS: A total of 4,752 participants were included. The study revealed significant variations in baseline Vitamin D and Vitamin A levels across different deficiency categories. Mean Vitamin D levels were lowest in the severe deficiency group (4.9 ng/mL) and highest in the normal group (34.8 ± 9.8 ng/mL), while mean Vitamin A levels were lowest in the deficiency group (226.6 ± 72.2 ng/mL) and highest in the normal group (263.3 ± 74.0 ng/mL). The study revealed a two-phase linear relationship with a significant threshold effect at a Vitamin D level of 28.289 ng/mL. Below this threshold, the association between Vitamin D and Vitamin A was strong (β = 2.935, 95% CI: 2.173, 3.696), while above the threshold, the association was significantly weaker (β = 0.737, 95% CI: 0.413, 1.061). The likelihood ratio test confirmed the significance of this threshold effect (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The study concludes that a significant threshold at 28.289 ng/mL Vitamin D marks a point beyond which the association with Vitamin A levels plateaus, highlighting the importance of this threshold for optimizing vitamin status in children."

      "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in gliadin-induced inflammation in celiac disease as they are the first immune cells to encounter gliadin. Tryptophan (Trp) and vitamin A (retinol, Ret) are known to influence the immune response of DCs to gliadin and increase their tolerogenicity. CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are important for immune tolerance, can be generated from naive T cells in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) and TGF-β.The aim of this study was to determine the combined effect of Ret and Trp in altering the phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs by gliadin and their contribution to the differentiation of Tregs. Monocyte cells derived from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with celiac disease were differentiated into DCs and stimulated with PT-gliadin. These cells were then treated with Trp + Ret. The expression of CD11c, CD14, CD83, CD86, PDL1, CD4, CD25 and FOXP3 was examined using flow cytometry. TGF-β, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α levels were measured by ELISA. qRT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), integrin αE (CD103), and NF-κB. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) mRNA and protein levels were assessed using qRT-PCR and Western blot assays, respectively. The maturation of DCs by PT-gliadin was defined through co-stimulatory molecule expression (CD83 and CD86) and promotion of TNF-α and IL-12 secretion. We found that after treatment with Ret + Trp, the production levels of IL-12, TNF-α, and NF-κB were significantly reduced, while the expression of IL-10, TGF-β, and the inhibitory markers PDL1, CD103, IDO, and RALDH2 by PT-gliadin-stimulated DCs was significantly increased. Furthermore, in a DC and T cell co-culture system, treatment of DCs with Ret + Trp increased TGF-β expression in DCS and promoted CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 Treg induction. These results indicate the potential benefit of vitamin A and tryptophan as therapeutic options for individuals with celiac disease. Further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms of action of these substances in these cells."

      "abstract": "This study explored the interaction effects of dietary Vitamin A (VA) and Vitamin D3 (VD3) on growth performance, jejunal function, and tibia development in goslings, aiming to identify any synergistic outcomes that may reshape nutritional strategies for geese production. A total of 540 one-day-old male Jiangnan White goslings with similar body weight (82 ± 5 g) were randomly assigned into 9 treatments with five replicate pens per treatment and 12 birds per pen. The bird trial employed a 3 × 3, two-factorial treatment with three levels of VA (5000, 7000, and 9000 IU/kg) and three levels of VD3 (1000, 1500, and 2000 IU/kg) from one to 28 days of age. Main effects analysis indicated that birds fed 7000 IU/kg VA exhibited the highest ADG, BW, jejunal maltase activity and IL-10 content (P < 0.05), while 9000 IU/kg VA had the highest SOD activity and content of IL-6 and TNF-α in jejunal mucosa (P < 0.05). Both 7000 IU/kg or 9000 IU/kg VA increased the jejunal IL-1β content, relative expression of tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) mRNA, tibia defatted weight and ash weight (P < 0.05). Birds fed 2000 IU/kg VD3 exhibited the highest ADFI, while both 1500 or 2000 IU/kg VD3 increased jejunal maltase activity, and tibia ash content (P < 0.05). An interaction between VA and VD3 on ADFI, F/G, jejunal maltase activity, mucosal immune factors (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α), tibia ash content, and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression. A simple effects analysis revealed that at a 5000 IU/kg VA, adding 1000 IU/kg VD3 decreased IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α (P < 0.05). At a 7000 IU/kg VA, adding 1500 or 2000 IU/kg VD3 decreased TNF-α, and increased jejunal maltase activity(P < 0.05). At a 9000 IU/kg VA, adding 1000 IU/kg VD3 decreased ADFI, F/G, jejunal maltase activity, tibia ash, and BMP-2, while IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α increased (P < 0.05). At a 9000 IU/kg VA, adding 2000 IU/kg VD3 increased IL-10 (P < 0.05). At a 1000 IU/kg VD3, adding 5000 IU/kg VA increased F/G, jejunal maltase activity and IL-10, while decreased IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α (P < 0.05), and adding 9000 IU/kg VA decreased tibia ash and BMP-2 (P < 0.05). At 1500 or 2000 IU/kg VD3, adding 7000 IU/kg VA increased jejunal maltase activity, IL-10 (P < 0.05). At a 2000 IU/kg VD3, adding 9000 IU/kg VA increased IL-6, and TNF-α (P < 0.05). In summary, a dietary level of 7000 IU/kg of VA and 2000 IU/kg of VD3 can be a balanced combination to optimize feed intake and conversion, jejunal function, and tibia mineralization, consequently enhancing growth performance in goslings."

      "abstract": "The distribution of stored dietary vitamin A/all-trans-retinol (ROL) from the liver throughout the body is critical for maintaining retinoid function in peripheral tissues and for generating visual pigments for photoreceptor cell function. ROL circulates in the blood bound to the retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) as RBP4-ROL. Two membrane receptors, RBPR2 in the liver and other non-ocular tissues, and STRA6 in the eye are proposed to bind circulatory RBP4 and this mechanism facilitates the internalization of ROL. Herein, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the importance of RBPR2 and influence of vitamin A content in the diet on whole-body retinoid homeostasis and its effects on chromophore production in the support of visual function. Rbpr2-knockout (Rbpr2-/-) and wild-type mice were fed a vitamin A sufficient (VAS) or a vitamin A deficient (VAD) diet. After 3-months of dietary intervention and compared with WT mice, Rbpr2-/- mice showed significantly lower hepatic ROL and retinyl ester content, and decreased chromophore concentrations, manifesting in dysfunctional scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG) responses. These phenotypes were more severe in VAD Rbpr2-/- mice, when compared with VAS Rbpr2-/- mice. After 6 months of dietary intervention, while WT mice were able to maintain retinoid homeostasis in peripheral tissues, Rbpr2-/- mice showed elevated serum apo-RBP4 protein, decreased retinoid content in peripheral tissues including the liver and the eye causing an accumulation of apoprotein opsin in photoreceptors, which resulted in delayed rod and cone opsin regeneration. Together, our analyses characterize the molecular events underlying nutritional blindness in a novel mouse model and indicate that the vitamin A receptor, RBPR2, is required for whole-body retinoid homeostasis, which supports chromophore production and visual function under variable conditions of dietary vitamin A intake throughout the lifespan of the animal.",

      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis, a complex process resulting from most chronic liver diseases, remains devoid of effective treatments. An increasing body of evidence links liver fibrosis to the \"gut-liver axis\", with disruptions in the gut microbiota-host balance emerging as a critical contributor to its progression. Cinnamaldehyde (Cin), a natural compound with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticytotoxic properties, has shown potential in counteracting hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. Additionally, Cin has been shown to promote probiotics in the intestine, thereby restoring a healthy microbial community. These characteristics position Cin as a promising candidate for liver fibrosis treatment through modulation of the gut-liver axis. In this study, a Vitamin A (Va)-formulated Cin Nanoemulsion (Va-Cin@NM) was developed to enhance the physicochemical stability of Cin while preserving intestinal homeostasis and facilitating targeted liver deposition. In bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver fibrosis in rats, Va-Cin@NM intervention significantly reduced bile duct-like structure proliferation and collagen deposition in the liver. These effects are likely attributed to the restoration of gut microbiota, increased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations, and improved intestinal integrity. Moreover, Va-Cin@NM treatment suppressed harmful bacterial populations in the liver, thus mitigating immune injury and inflammatory cell recruitment. Consequently, oxidative stress and HSC activation were attenuated. Overall, Va-Cin@NM demonstrates significant potential as a nanotherapeutic approach for liver fibrosis by modulating the gut-liver axis.",

However, the mechanism underlying retinal cell-specific effects of LHON-linked mtDNA mutations remains poorly understood, and there has been no effective treatment or cure for this disorder. Using a mouse model bearing an LHON-linked ND6P25L mutation, we demonstrated that the mutation caused retinal cell-specific deficiencies, especially in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), rods, and Müller cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed cell-specific dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and visual signaling pathways in the mutant retina. Strikingly, ND6 mutation-induced dysfunctions caused abnormal vitamin A (VA) metabolism essential for visual function. VA supplementation remarkably alleviated retinal deficiencies, including reduced fundus lesion and retinal thickness and increased numbers of RGCs, photoreceptors, and Müller cell neurites. The restoration of visual functions with VA treatment were further evidenced by correcting dysregulations of phototransduction cascade and neurotransmitter transmission and restoring electrophysiological properties. Interestingly, VA supplementation markedly rescued the abnormal mitochondrial morphologies and functions in the mutant retina. These findings provide insight into retina-specific pathophysiology of mitochondrial retinopathy arising from VA deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mtDNA mutation and a step toward therapeutic intervention for LHON and other mitochondrial retinopathies.",

We report two cases of a seven-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy in Japan with xerophthalmia caused by VAD associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The first case demonstrates severe complications of prolonged VAD, including optic disc edema and irreversible corneal damage, which then results in blindness. The second case identified and treated earlier in the stage of corneal xerosis shows favorable prognosis. These two cases illustrate the risk of VAD among children with ASD and the importance of timely intervention to prevent permanent vision loss. Because of the prevalence of ASD, awareness of VAD as a potential health problem needs to be raised. Early detection, proper treatment, and dietary guidance are crucial in managing VAD. Ophthalmologists must be vigilant for signs of VAD in children with ASD, including difficulty opening eyelids, to prevent irreversible visual loss."

This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 159 children with eczema admitted to the hospital from May 2023 to October 2024 as the experimental group. The patients were divided into groups according to the severity of the disease: mild group(≤ 25 points, n = 45), moderate group(25-50 points, n = 72) and severe group(>50 points, n = 42). Collect each group of serum serum vitamin A, 25- (OH) D3, TG2, IL-4, and IL-13 levels and analyze them. The improvements in serum vitamin A, 25-(OH)D3, TG2, IL-4, and IL-13 levels in each group of children after 3 months of treatment were further analyzed. As eczema severity escalated, there was a progressive decline in Vit A and 25-(OH)D3 levels, while TG2, IL-4, and IL-13 levels correspondingly rose (P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between serum Vit A and 25-(OH)D3 levels and the SCORAD scores in children with eczema (P < 0.05). Conversely, TG2, IL-4, and IL-13 levels exhibited positive correlations with the SCORAD scores (P < 0.05). 25-(OH)D3 had the highest AUC for diagnosing the severity of eczema, which was significantly better than serum vitamin A, TG2, IL-4, and IL - 13 ( all P < 0.05 ). After 3 months of treatment, the serum levels of vitamin A, 25-(OH)D3, TG2, IL-4, and IL-13 in all groups were significantly improved (P < 0.05). Vit A, 25-(OH)D3, TG2, IL-4, and IL-13 correlate with the severity of eczema symptoms. The severity of the disease can be evaluated clinically according to the changes in these serum indicators, and the clinical application value is high.",

A 10-year, subnational economic optimization model making use of secondary dietary intake data and program cost data was developed and implemented to address these issues and included the following vitamin A program options: existing or improved edible oils fortification, a pair of hypothetical vitamin A-fortified bouillon programs, and a set of subnational vitamin A supplementation (VAS) programs. The model consistently identified the improved edible oils and bouillon fortification programs as the core national programs upon which the more expensive subnational VAS programs could be layered, depending on policy objectives and available funding. These results were robust to uncertainty in program nutritional benefits and costs. However, even if the most impactful set of modeled programs was implemented, vitamin A inadequacy among children would remain a serious public health problem; hence, additional efforts to address it would be needed.",

METHODS: We employed an NEC mouse model and administered vitamin A treatment. Retinol levels in mouse blood were quantified using ELISA. Intestinal cell apoptosis in NEC mice was assessed via the TUNEL assay. We evaluated mRNA and protein expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome C (CytoC), Caspase 3, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway components using qPCR and western blotting. RESULTS: In NEC models, PI3K, Akt, and Bcl-2 were downregulated, accompanied by upregulated Bax, CytoC, and Caspase 3 at both mRNA and protein levels. These molecular changes were associated with an increase in enterocyte apoptosis in the NEC models. Vitamin A supplementation increased PI3K, Akt, and Bcl-2 expression while decreasing Bax, CytoC, and Caspase 3 levels in the NEC models, resulting in reduced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Vitamin A has the potential to mitigate enterocyte apoptosis in NEC by upregulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and modulating apoptotic signals, providing new insights into the inhibitory effect of vitamin A on enterocyte apoptosis in NEC.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin A is a crucial nutrient renowned for its role in visual health and cellular regulation. Its derivatives influence cell differentiation, proliferation, and tissue homeostasis, making them significant in cancer research due to their effects on both normal and tumour cells. This review explores the intricate relationship between vitamin A metabolism and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cancer. The ECM profoundly affects tumour behaviour, including proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Alterations in the ECM can facilitate tumour progression, and vitamin A derivatives have shown potential in modulating these changes. Through transcriptional regulation, vitamin A impacts ECM components and matrix metalloproteinases, influencing tumour dynamics. The review highlights the potential of vitamin A and its derivatives as adjunctive agents in cancer therapy. Despite promising laboratory findings, their clinical application remains limited due to challenges in translating these effects into therapeutic outcomes. Future research should focus on the modulation of retinol metabolism within tumours and the development of targeted therapies to enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient prognosis."

Tissue engineering with the use of scaffolds offers more versatile and faster solutions in treatment. Extracellular matrix (ECM) and its three-dimensional (3D) network structure as a biological bond by imitating the tissue microstructure has been used for tissue repair, which can answer many existing challenges. Vitamin A, which comes in several forms such as retinols, retinals, and retinoic acids, is a necessary vitamin that is crucial for wound healing. In this research, sheep kidney capsule tissue decellularized with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) containing different doses of vitamin A has been used as an ECM in skin tissue engineering. The above scaffold was evaluated in terms of properties such as biocompatibility, analysis of mechanical properties, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), hydrophilicity, antibacterial, and cell adhesion. The findings reported suitable properties for wound dressing, especially at a dose of 15,000 U/ml vitamin A for this scaffold. Then, the above scaffold was evaluated on the full-thickness wound model in rat, which showed good wound contraction, and increased VEGF factor. It showed a decrease in IL-1β level. Therefore, the use of the above-mentioned decellularized scaffold in combination with medicinal agents effective in wound healing can be introduced for further pre-clinical studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, most large-scale public health programs, such as immunization or anti-parasitic deworming, work in relative isolation. Integrating efforts across programs could potentially improve their efficiency, but identifying populations that could benefit from multiple programs has been an operational challenge. METHODS: We analyzed a nationally representative survey conducted in India between 2019 and 2021 to assess and map coverage of seven vaccines [Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), hepatitis B, polio, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), haemophilus influenza type b (Hib), rotavirus and measles-containing vaccine (MCV)], plus Vitamin A supplementation and anti-parasitic deworming treatment among 86 761 children aged 1-3 years old. RESULTS: National coverage varied widely by program, from 42% (rotavirus) to 95% (BCG). There was high correlation between district-level coverage estimates (r ≥ 0.7) and extensive spatial overlap in low-coverage populations. In simulated implementation strategies, we show that an integrated strategy that targets full immunization coverage for four core vaccines (BCG, polio, DTP, MCV) would achieve similar coverage to an optimal (but unrealistic) implementation strategy and far better coverage than multiple efforts focused on individual vaccines. Targeting the most under-vaccinated districts within states based on spatial clustering or coverage thresholds led to further improvements in full coverage per child targeted. Integration of anti-parasitic deworming or rotavirus vaccination into a core vaccine delivery mission could nearly double their coverage (from ∼45% to ∼85%). CONCLUSIONS: Integrated delivery and geographic targeting across core vaccines could accelerate India's progress toward full immunization coverage. An integrated platform could greatly expand coverage of non-core vaccines and other child health interventions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dysuria in children can have various etiologies, including ureteric stones, phimosis, congenital obstructive posterior urethral membrane, and neurogenic bladders. However, there have been no reports of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) causing dysuria due to urethral keratosis. Here, we report two cases of urethral keratosis caused by a VAD. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old boy (Patient 1) and a 6-year-old boy (Patient 2) presented with multiple episodes of dysuria and epididymitis. Both patients had intellectual disabilities and autism, which prevented voiding cystourethrography. Therefore, the patient was admitted for cystoscopy under general anesthesia. Cystoscopy revealed urethral diastolic dysfunction and a large amount of desquamated epithelium obstructing the urethra in both patients, causing urinary obstruction and dysuria. Catheterization was repeated; however, the symptoms recurred after catheter removal. Although the cause of recurrent urinary obstruction could not be initially identified, an ophthalmologist found Bitot's spots and suggested the possibility of a VAD. Serum vitamin A levels were extremely low in both patients, leading to the diagnosis of urethral keratosis due to VAD. VAD can be attributed to an unbalanced diet resulting from intellectual disabilities or autism. Vitamin A replacement therapy improved both the urethral symptoms and cystoscopic findings. CONCLUSION: Dysuria due to VAD is extremely rare, and urethral keratosis as a cause of dysuria is likely the first report of its kind worldwide. VAD may develop due to an unbalanced diet in patients with intellectual disabilities or autism. Therefore, it is essential to consider VAD as a potential cause of dysuria in patients with intellectual disabilities and autism.",

An extensive literature search for relevant studies was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, and so on. After screening in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 articles on vitamin A deficiency and 12 articles on vitamin A supplementation were included. Stata 17.0 software was used to perform meta-analysis, heterogeneity test, and sensitivity analysis, and the corresponding mathematical model was used to merge the data. The meta-analysis results of the relationship between vitamin A deficiency and neonatal respiratory diseases indicated that compared with the neonates with normal vitamin A, the neonates with vitamin A deficiency had adverse health outcomes of neonatal respiratory diseases (OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 2.68-8.84), of which neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) (OR = 4.10, 95% CI: 2.32-7.23) and neonatal pneumonia (OR = 3.22, 95% CI: 2.18-4.77) were analyzed by subgroup analysis. The meta-analysis of the relationship between vitamin A supplementation therapy and neonatal respiratory diseases showed that vitamin A supplementation was an effective therapeutic measure for neonatal respiratory diseases (RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.04-1.07): NRDS (RR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02-1.05) and NBPD (RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15). The funnel chart method results show that there was publication bias in studies on vitamin A deficiency induced to and vitamin A supplementation therapy for neonatal respiratory diseases. The sensitivity analysis results showed that excluding some special article had some effect on the final pooled effect. But generally speaking, the result of meta-analysis was stable. There is a statistical correlation of vitamin A on the neonatal respiratory diseases from two aspects of etiological exploration and effect evaluation of treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Moderate vitamin A levels during pregnancy are strongly related to normal embryonic development in both animal models and population studies. Abnormal development of urinary tract system is linked to either an excess or a shortage of vitamin A. The relationships among maternal vitamin A deficiency prior to conception, moderate vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy, and abnormal urinary system development in offspring are unclear. METHODS: By creating preconception and preconception + pregnancy vitamin A insufficiency mouse models, we investigated whether moderate vitamin A treatment during pregnancy may reduce the prevalence of CAKUT and increase distant vitamin A levels in offspring, as well as any potential pathways involved. RESULTS: We effectively established a prepregnancy vitamin A-deficient mouse model by providing a particular diet with or without vitamin A for 4 weeks. The offspring of the hypovitaminosis A model group presented a greater proportion of neonatal urinary tract developmental malformations. Abnormalities in ureteral bud emergence and key molecules during renal development, such as p-Plcγ and Ret, may be the primary causes of offspring development of CAKUT as a result of mothers' hypovitaminosis A. Normal vitamin A diets, on the other hand, may help mitigate the teratogenic consequences of prepregnancy hypovitaminosis A, as well as defects produced by ureteral budding and major molecular changes. CONCLUSION: In contrast, the administration of normal vitamin A feeds during pregnancy may ameliorate the teratogenic effects of prepregnancy hypovitaminosis A to a certain extent and may also ameliorate the abnormalities associated with ureteral budding and key molecular changes.",

      "abstract": "The liver is an immune-tolerant organ, allowing for organ transplantation with less immune suppression compared with other organs. It also provides fertile soil for tumor metastases, which tend to be more resistant to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy than metastases in other organs. This resistance may result from the sum of incremental evolutionary adaptions in various cell types to prevent overaction to antigens absorbed from the gut into the portal circulation or it might involve a central mechanism. Here, we propose that metabolism of vitamin A, which is highly concentrated in the liver, is a root source of tolerance and resistance of hepatic metastases to checkpoint blockade. Suppression of retinoic acid synthesis from vitamin A with disulfiram may mitigate tolerance and produce enhanced immunotherapy treatment results for patients with liver metastases.",

This research aims to evaluate the effect of oral supplementation with garlic alone, vitamins A, D3, E alone, and their combination on heat detection, pregnancy rate and serum profile in anestrus dairy cows. Using a completely randomized design, this study, conducted over 327 days, evaluated 72 anestrus-affected cows, which were divided into four groups. T0 (Control) received only normal saline; T1 with vitamin A,D3,E; T2 with Garlic and T3 integrated with A, D3, E + Garlic in drinking water. Results demonstrated that the treatment groups exhibited significantly higher estrus signs (p < 0.05) compared to the control. The pregnancy rate was also increased (P = 0.059), especially in the T3 group which had the highest heat detection (55.55 %), conception (70 %), and pregnancy (38.88 %). In comparison, the heat detection rate for T1 was 44.44 %, while the conception rate for T2 was 66.66 %. Additionally, T0 exhibited the least proportion across all parameters. Additionally, the elevated BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) and blood glucose levels observed in non-responsive (those not showing signs of heat) cows at 32.51 and 43.65 mg/dl respectively, compared to responsive cows (those showing signs of heat) with levels of 22.40 and 51.34 mg/dl. These findings suggest a potential association between these blood parameters and the cyclicity of dairy cows. These findings highlight that oral supplementation with vitamin AD3E+Garlic significantly improves the heat detection rate and pregnancy rate than only administering vitamin AD3E or Garlic with anestrus in dairy cattle."

      "abstract": "The nuclear hormone family of receptors regulates gene expression. The androgen receptor (AR), upon ligand binding and homodimerization, shuttles from the cytosol into the nucleus to activate gene expression. Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) are present in the nucleus bound to chromatin as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and repress gene expression. Ligand binding leads to transcription activation. The hormonal ligands for these receptors play crucial roles to ensure the proper conduct of very many tissues and exert effects on prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Androgens support PCa proliferation and androgen deprivation alone or with chemotherapy is the standard therapy for PCa. RARγ activation and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) stimulation of TRβ support the growth of PCa cells. Ligand stimulation of VDR drives growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis of PCa cells. Often these receptors are explored as separate avenues to find treatments for PCa and other cancers. However, there is accumulating evidence to support receptor interactions and crosstalk of regulatory events whereby a better understanding might lead to new combinatorial treatments.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As currently applied, the paired retinol isotope dilution (RID) test, which is used to assess the impact of a vitamin A intervention on vitamin A total body stores (TBS), requires 2 doses of stable isotope-labeled vitamin A. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate use of a single isotope dose (4 μmol) to assess TBS by RID before and after intervention in theoretical children with low/moderate TBS. METHODS: We selected 6 theoretical children with assigned values for TBS ranging from 82 to 281 μmol. Using Simulation, Analysis and Modeling software, we simulated the variable [plasma retinol specific activity (SAp)] and coefficients (Fa and S) used in the RID equation TBS (μmol) = FaS × 1/SAp in both the unsupplemented steady state at day 14 postdosing and during the subsequent 4 mo without or with vitamin A supplementation [2.8 μmol retinol/d (801 μg retinol activity equivalents/d)]. RESULTS: Fraction of dose in plasma on day 150 compared with day 14 was similar in the unsupplemented and supplemented conditions [geometric mean, 32% (range, 20%-48%) and 30% (20%-48%), respectively] and simulated values for FaS were similar under the 2 conditions. After 2 and 4 mo of daily vitamin A supplementation with 2.8 μmol/d, TBS was 78% and 128% higher, respectively, than without supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the paired RID method can successfully be done using a single 4 μmol dose of stable isotope. Furthermore, because values for the RID coefficient FaS were similar in the unsupplemented and vitamin A-supplemented conditions, these results in theoretical children indicate that FaS determined by population (\"super-subject\") modeling of steady state vitamin A kinetic data could be used to predict TBS by RID after a vitamin A intervention in individuals from the same or a similar group.",

      "abstract": "Biofortification of green leafy vegetables with pro-vitamin A carotenoids, such as β-carotene, has remained challenging to date. Here, we combined two strategies to achieve this goal. One of them involves producing β-carotene in the cytosol of leaf cells to avoid the negative impacts on photosynthesis derived from changing the balance of carotenoids and chlorophylls in chloroplasts. The second approach involves the conversion of chloroplasts into non-photosynthetic, carotenoid-overaccumulating chromoplasts in leaves agroinfiltrated or infected with constructs encoding the bacterial phytoene synthase crtB, leaving other non-engineered leaves of the plant to sustain normal growth. A combination of these two strategies, referred to as strategy C (for cytosolic production) and strategy P (for plastid conversion mediated by crtB), resulted in a 5-fold increase in the amount of β-carotene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Following several attempts to further improve β-carotene leaf contents by metabolic engineering, hormone treatments and genetic screenings, it was found that promoting the proliferation of plastoglobules with increased light-intensity treatments not only improved β-carotene accumulation but it also resulted in a much higher bioaccessibility. The combination of strategies C and P together with a more intense light treatment increased the levels of accessible β-carotene 30-fold compared to controls. We further demonstrated that stimulating plastoglobule proliferation with strategy P, but also with a higher-light treatment alone, also improved β-carotene contents and bioaccessibility in edible lettuce (Lactuca sativa) leaves.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Maternal nutritional and vitamin status during pregnancy may have long-term effects on offspring health and disease. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between maternal vitamin A and D status in pregnancy and offspring bone mineral content (BMC) at nine years of age. METHODS: This is a post-hoc study of a randomized control trial including 855 pregnant women from two Norwegian cities; Trondheim and Stavanger. The women were randomized into an exercise intervention or standard antenatal care. Mother and child pairs for the present study were recruited from those still living in Trondheim after 8-10 years. Serum vitamin A (retinol) and vitamin D (25(OH)D) were measured in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, and active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in serum was measured in a subgroup. Spine BMC and trabecular bone score were measured in the children at nine years of age. Associations were analyzed with linear regression models. RESULTS: A total of 119 mother and child pairs were included in the analyses. Vitamin A insufficiency (retinol< 1.05 µmol/L) and vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D< 50 mmol/L) increased from ~7% to ~43% and from ~28% to ~33%, respectively, from the 2nd to the 3rd trimester. An increase in serum 1,25(OH)2D from the 2nd to the 3rd trimester was observed in the subgroup. There was a negative association between serum retinol in the 2nd trimester and spine BMC in the boys, but not in the girls, when adjusted for maternal and child confounders. No other associations between maternal serum vitamin A or D and BMC in the children were found. CONCLUSION: We observed a high prevalence of vitamin A insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy. A negative association between mid-pregnancy vitamin A status and spine BMC was observed in boys, but not girls, while no associations were found between maternal vitamin D status and child BMC. The implications of optimal vitamin A and D status in pregnancy for offspring bone health, remains a subject for further investigations.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin A (VA) has many functions in the body, some of which are key for the development and functioning of the nervous system, while some others might indirectly influence neural function. Both hypovitaminosis and hypervitaminosis A can lead to clinical manifestations of concern for individuals and for general global health. Scientific evidence on the link between VA and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is growing, with some clinical studies and accumulating results obtained from basic research using cellular and animal models. Remarkably, it has been shown that VA deficiency can exacerbate autistic symptomatology. In turn, VA supplementation has been shown to be able to improve autistic symptomatology in selected groups of individuals with ASD. However, it is important to recognize that ASD is a highly heterogeneous condition. Therefore, it is important to clarify how and when VA supplementation can be of benefit for affected individuals. Here we delve into the relationship between VA and ASD, discussing clinical observations and mechanistic insights obtained from research on selected autistic syndromes and laboratory models to advance in defining how the VA signaling pathway can be exploited for treatment of ASD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the impact of Vitamin A (VA) on intestinal glucose metabolic phenotypes. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were randomized assigned to a VA-normal diet (VAN) or a VA-deficient diet (VAD) for 12 weeks. After12 weeks, the VAD mice were given 30 IU/g/d retinol for 10 days and VAN diet (VADN) for 10 weeks. By using glucose tolerance tests, immunofluorescence staining, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, siRNA transduction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the glucose metabolic phenotypes as well as secretory function and intracellular hormone changes of STC-1 were assessed. RESULTS: VAD mice showed a decrease of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and a loss of intestinal glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) expression. Through reintroducing dietary VA to VAD mice, the intestinal VA levels, GLP-1 expression and normal glucose can be restored. The incubation with retinol increased VA signaling factors expression within STC-1 cells, especially retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ). The activation of RARβ restored intracellular incretin hormone synthesis and secretory function. CONCLUSIONS: VA deficiency leads to an imbalance of intestinal glucose metabolic phenotypes through a mechanism involving RARβ signaling pathway, suggesting a new method to achieve the treatment for VAD induced glucose metabolism impairment.",

The olfactory function may be also affected with COVID-19. In this randomized clinical trial, we wanted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of olfactory training with and without oral vitamin A for COVID-19-related olfactory dysfunction. METHODS: Patients answered to the standard Persian version of anosmia reporting tool and performed the quick smell test before and after 12 weeks and at the end of the 12 months follow up. The patients were randomly allocated to three groups; Group A treatment with olfactory training, Group B treatment with oral vitamin A and olfactory training, and Group C as control group which only underwent nasal irrigation twice a day. Patients were treated for 3 months and followed up for 12 months. RESULTS: Totally 90 patients were included in three groups. After interventions, 76.9% of patients in Group A, 86.7% of patients in Group B, and 26.7% of patients in Group C completely improved. The average intervention time was statistically significant in relationship with the final olfactory status of the patients in the 12 months follow-up. The olfactory training has significantly improved the smell alteration at the end of 3- and 12- months follow-up in A and B groups. CONCLUSION: A three-months olfactory training is effective for improvement of COVID-19-related olfactory dysfunction. Adding daily oral vitamin A to olfactory training did not lead to better results in improving olfactory dysfunction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Step 2 (Level 2*): Randomized trial.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between deficiency of vitamin A or D at diagnosis of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and subsequent infectious complications during induction therapy. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted an institutional review board-approved, retrospective cohort study of children with newly diagnosed ALL from 2007 to 2017 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We measured vitamin D, vitamin D binding protein, retinol binding protein as a surrogate for vitamin A, and immunoglobulin isotypes in serum obtained at ALL diagnosis, and we assessed the association between vitamin deficiencies or levels and infection-related complications during the 6-week induction phase using Cox regression models. RESULTS: Among 378 evaluable participants, vitamin A and D deficiencies were common (43% and 17%, respectively). Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher risks of febrile neutropenia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.7; P = .0072), clinically documented infection (aHR, 1.73; P = .025), and likely bacterial infection (aHR, 1.86; P = .008). Conversely, vitamin A deficiency was associated solely with a lower risk of sepsis (aHR, 0.19; P = .027). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, vitamin D deficiency was associated with an increased risk of common infection-related complications during induction therapy for ALL. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation could mitigate this effect.",

This experiment's objective is to evaluate different feeding strategies and their effects on body condition score, subcutaneous fat color, and carcass yield and quality traits in cull cows. The central hypothesis is feeding a high-energy diet, with low levels of vitamin A, for 56 d will improve animal performance, carcass yield, and quality traits in addition to capturing the point (rate) of the conversion of yellow to white subcutaneous fat. In the present experiment 98 Angus crossbreed cows were utilized. Cows were fed either low vitamin A (LVA) diet consisting of whole shelled corn, soybean hulls, soybean meal, and a mineral-vitamin supplement or high vitamin A (HVA) diet, formulated using whole shelled corn, fescue hay, dry distiller grains with soluble, and a mineral-vitamin supplement for 56 d. During the 56 d feeding period, body weights and condition scores, and subcutaneous adipose samples were collected every 14 d. On day 56, cattle were slaughtered; 48 h postmortem carcass characteristics and objective color scores (subcutaneous adipose tissue) were recorded and a sample of the longissimus dorsi lumborum was collected. Subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were utilized to record subjective color scores and then ground to be analyzed for β-carotene concentration. The longissimus dorsi lumborum samples (2.54 cm slices) were removed for Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and pH testing. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Feeding cull cows LVA resulted in differences in subcutaneous carcass fat color (P = 0.01) as well as b* values (P < 0.01) on day 56 compared with HVA. Subjective fat color scores were not different (P > 0.10) on day 0 or 14 but were different (P ≤ 0.05) on days 28, 42, and 56. Additionally, 9-cis-β-carotene concentration on day 56 were different (P = 0.05) between treatments. A trend was noticed for all-trans-β-carotene concentration (P = 0.10) on day 56 as well. Cull cow body weights were greater (P ≤ 0.04) when fed the LVA diet starting on days 14, 28, and 42; and a trend was noticed on day 56 (P = 0.09). Overall, cows fed the LVA treatment for 56 d exhibited decreased adipose yellowness and β-carotene concentrations as well as increased live weights."

METHODS: Using a systematic literature search method, relevant research literature is searched, and RCT studies that meet the requirements are selected based on preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, a quality evaluation was conducted on the included literature, and meta-analysis was used to calculate the combined effect values of mortality rate, hospital stay, lung rale disappearance time, cough duration, fever duration, IL-6 and IL-10 levels, and heterogeneity analysis was conducted. The levels of IL-6 and IL-10 represent the inflammatory levels in pediatric MPP patients, and exploring their changes has significant implications for the anti-inflammatory effect of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 10 RCT studies were included, with a total sample size of 1,485, including 750 cases in the control group and 735 cases in the observation group. The meta-analysis results of this study showed that there was a significant difference in the total clinical efficacy of using VitA adjuvant therapy compared to the control group without VitA [OR = 3.07, 95%CI = (2.81, 4.27)], P < 0.05. However, there was no significant difference in the adverse reaction rate between the use of VitA as an adjuvant therapy and the control without VitA [OR = 1.17, 95%CI = (0.61, 2.27)], P > 0.05. At the same time, the hospitalization time [MSD = -0.86, 95% CI = (-1.61, -0.21)], lung rale disappearance time [MSD = -0.78, 95%CI = (-1.19,-0.51)], cough duration [MSD = -1.07, 95%CI = (-1.41, -0.71)], and fever duration [MSD = -0.47, 95%CI = (-0.72, -0.23)] using VitA as an adjuvant treatment were obviously lower. In addition, the meta-analysis outcomes also showed that the use of VitA adjuvant therapy can significantly reduce IL-6 [MSD = -1.07, 95%CI = (-1.81, -0.27)] and IL-10 [MSD = -0.13, 95%CI = (-0.31, 0.12)] levels. This indicates that the application of VitA in pediatric MPP also has the effect of reducing inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: Based on the meta-analysis results, VitA adjuvant therapy can significantly improve the clinical symptoms of pediatric MPP patients, shorten hospitalization time, promote the disappearance of lung rales, and alleviate cough and fever symptoms. In addition, VitA adjuvant therapy can effectively reduce inflammation levels, indicating its potential role in inhibiting inflammatory responses. In clinical practice, VitA adjuvant therapy for pediatric MPP can be promoted as a potential treatment option."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inadequate vitamin A (VA) intake is common among lactating women in many communities worldwide, but high-dose VA supplementation for postpartum women is not recommended by the World Health Organization as an effective intervention. OBJECTIVES: To simulate the impact of VA intake via diet and daily VA supplements on VA total body stores (TBS) and balance in theoretical lactating women with low/moderate TBS. METHODS: We studied 6 theoretical subjects with assigned values for TBS from 219-624 μmol. Using Simulation, Analysis, and Modeling software and a previously published compartmental model for whole-body VA metabolism, we simulated TBS over 6 mo of established lactation for each subject under 4 conditions: 1) prelactation VA intake was increased to maintain VA balance (LSS); 2) prelactation VA intake was maintained (NLSS); 3) VA intake was the same as 2) but a daily VA supplement (2.8 μmol/d) was added (NLSS+S); and 4) VA intake was as 1) and the daily VA supplement was included (LSS+S). RESULTS: To compensate for the loss of VA via milk while VA balance was maintained (LSS) over 6 mo of lactation, VA intake had to increase by 0.8-1.87 μmol/d (n = 6) compared with NLSS. Over 6 mo of NLSS treatment, VA balance was negative (geometric mean, -0.77 μmol/d) compared with LSS, whereas balance was positive under NLSS+S and LSS+S conditions (0.75 and 1.5 μmol/d, respectively). For LSS, the proportion of total VA disposal was 37% via breastmilk, 32% from VA stores, and 32% from nonstorage tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a daily VA supplement (2.8 μmol/d) to the diet of lactating women with suboptimal VA intake may effectively counterbalance the negative VA balance resulting from the output of VA via breastmilk and thus benefit both mother and infant by maintaining or increasing VA stores and breastmilk VA concentration.",

      "abstract": "Skin photoaging is a skin degenerative disease that causes patients to develop malignant tumors. The existing clinical treatment of photoaging has limitations. This greatly reduces the recovery rate of photoaging patients. Studies have confirmed that Ligusticum wallichii Franch (LWF) monomer tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) alleviates various skin diseases. The combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine helps with this process. Our research aimed to explore the specific treatment mode and molecular mechanism of TMP in treating skin photoaging. CCK-8 assays were used to evaluate the activity and toxicity of HaCaT cells. β-galactosidase aging, Carbonyl compound and nitrosylated tyrosine assays were used to analyze the aging of HaCaT cells. ROS assays and ELISA were used to analyze the enrichment of ROS. The molecular docking experiment analyzed the binding of TMP and HIF-1α. qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the activation of skin aging-related pathways. HE staining was used to analyze the thickness of the stratum corneum skin on the back skin of mice. 200μg/L LWF alleviates cellular photoaging and mouse skin photoaging by reducing ROS enrichment. Its monomer TMP plays an important role in this process. The combination of TMP and HIF-1α accelerates the degradation of ROS by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway. This process reduces the apoptosis of cells damaged by light. In addition, we also found that the combination of TMP and retinoic acid (RA) is more beneficial for the treatment of skin damage caused by light in mice. The combination therapy of TMP and RA alleviates skin oxidative stress response through overexpression of HIF-1α. This plan is beneficial for the treatment of skin photoaging.",

Ocular manifestations of hypovitaminosis A may present with anterior segment signs of xeropthalmia, with advanced cases also causing classic retinal and electrophysiologic changes of vitamin A deficiency retinopathy. We present a case of vitamin A deficiency retinopathy, with corresponding retinal imaging and electrophysiology, in an adult patient with celiac disease and liver fibrosis. METHODS: A single case report was conducted in Toronto, Canada. RESULTS: A 77-year-old male with known celiac disease and liver fibrosis presented progressively worsening vision noticed primarily when driving. Vision was 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS. Bitot spots were noted on anterior segment examination. Fundus photography demonstrated bilateral peripheral macular hypopigmentation and far-peripheral granular retinal hypopigmentation with focal yellow dots and hyper-pigmented deposits. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging demonstrated indistinct outer retinal banding with mild outer nuclear layer thinning, focal hyper-reflective deposits, and a thin choroid bilaterally. Full-field electroretinography (ERG) testing demonstrated reduced rod-isolated and combined rod-cone response amplitudes, and multifocal ERG testing demonstrated blunted individual responses throughout the field. The patient was treated with pulse vitamin A therapy. After 6 months of therapy, ERG responses were back within reference range, and the outer retinal changes reversed; visual acuity improved to 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. CONCLUSION: This case represents the classic findings of vitamin A deficiency retinopathy on fundus examination and electrophysiologic testing secondary to gastrointestinal pathology. Prompt treatment of high dose vitamin A supplementation led to improvement of full-field and multifocal ERG results, as well as reconstitution of outer retinal architecture.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This systematic review with meta-analyses of randomised trials evaluated the preventive effects of vitamin A supplements versus placebo or no intervention on clinically important outcomes, in people of any age. METHODS: We searched different electronic databases and other resources for randomised clinical trials that had compared vitamin A supplements versus placebo or no intervention (last search 16 April 2024). We used Cochrane methodology. We used the random-effects model to calculate risk ratios (RRs), with 95% CIs. We analysed individually and cluster randomised trials separately. Our primary outcomes were mortality, adverse events and quality of life. We assessed risks of bias in the trials and used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) to assess the certainty of the evidence. RESULTS: We included 120 randomised trials (1 671 672 participants); 105 trials allocated individuals and 15 allocated clusters. 92 trials included children (78 individually; 14 cluster randomised) and 28 adults (27 individually; 1 cluster randomised). 14/105 individually randomised trials (13%) and none of the cluster randomised trials were at overall low risk of bias. Vitamin A did not reduce mortality in individually randomised trials (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05; I²=32%; p=0.19; 105 trials; moderate certainty), and this effect was not affected by the risk of bias. In individually randomised trials, vitamin A had no effect on mortality in children (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04; I²=24%; p=0.28; 78 trials, 178 094 participants) nor in adults (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.13; I²=24%; p=0.27; 27 trials, 61 880 participants). Vitamin A reduced mortality in the cluster randomised trials (0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.93; I²=66%; p=0.0008; 15 trials, 14 in children and 1 in adults; 364 343 participants; very low certainty). No trial reported serious adverse events or quality of life. Vitamin A slightly increased bulging fontanelle of neonates and infants. We are uncertain whether vitamin A influences blindness under the conditions examined. CONCLUSIONS: Based on moderate certainty of evidence, vitamin A had no effect on mortality in the individually randomised trials. Very low certainty evidence obtained from cluster randomised trials suggested a beneficial effect of vitamin A on mortality. If preventive vitamin A programmes are to be continued, supporting evidence should come from randomised trials allocating individuals and assessing patient-meaningful outcomes.

      "abstract": "Controlled release drug delivery systems of eye drops are a promising ophthalmic therapy with advantages of good patient compliance and low irritation. However, the lack of a suitable drug carrier for ophthalmic use limits the development of the aforementioned system. Herein, the crosslinked cyclodextrin organic framework (COF) with a cubic porous structure and a uniform particle size was synthesized and applied to solidify vitamin A palmitate (VAP) by using the solvent-free method. The VAP@COF suspension eye drops were formulated by screening co-solvents, suspending agents, and stabilizing agents to achieve a homogeneous state and improve stability. According to the in vitro release study, the VAP@COF suspension exhibited a controlled release of VAP within 12 h. Both the ex vivo corneal contact angle and in vivo fluorescence tracking indicated that the VAP@COF suspension prolonged the VAP residence time on the ocular surface. This suspension accelerated the recovery of the dry eye disease (DED) model in New Zealand rabbits. Furthermore, the suspension was non-cytotoxic to human corneal epithelial cells and non-irritation to rabbit eyes. In summary, the particulate COF is an eye-acceptable novel carrier that sustains release and prolongs the VAP residence time on the ocular surface for DED treatment.",

      "abstract": "Fortification of edible oil with vitamin A is a widely adopted intervention to minimize the effects of vitamin A deficiency in vulnerable groups and mitigate some of its deleterious consequences. Regulatory monitoring is an important prerequisite to ensure that the fortification program is implemented effectively. Standard laboratory analysis methods for vitamin A in oils to assess adequate addition levels remain expensive and time-consuming. Portable testing devices are relatively less expensive in terms of capital investment and cost per test. However, the reliability of results needs to be assured to ensure acceptability and confidence. This study compared a portable device to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in terms of quantification of vitamin A in both spiked and commercially fortified oils. Nine oils (soybean, palm, cottonseed, rapeseed, corn, peanut, coconut, sunflower, and rice bran oils) were selected and spiked with retinyl palmitate at six different concentrations, and 112 commercially fortified oils were quantified for their vitamin A content using both methods. A good indicator of intra-day and inter-day repeatability (< 10% CV) was obtained for the measurement of vitamin A in the spiked oils for both methods, which denotes a high agreement between them. Vitamin A recoveries were 97-132% for HPLC and 74-127% for the portable device. A strong positive correlation, r = 0.88, is observed between the two methods for the quantification of vitamin A in the commercially fortified oils. The portable device provides a relatively low-cost, quick, and user-friendly alternative to HPLC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: According to global prevalence analysis studies, acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are the most common acute infectious disease in children, especially in preschool children. Acute URTIs lead to an economic burden on families and society. Vitamin A refers to the fat-soluble compound all-trans-retinol and also represents retinol and its active metabolites. Vitamin A interacts with both the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system and improves the host's defences against infections. Correlation studies show that serum retinol deficiency was associated with a higher risk of respiratory tract infections. Therefore, vitamin A supplementation may be important in preventing acute URTIs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of vitamin A supplements for preventing acute upper respiratory tract infections in children up to seven years of age. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and two trial registration platforms to 8 June 2023. We also checked the reference lists of all primary studies and reviewed relevant systematic reviews and trials for additional references. We imposed no language or publication restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which evaluated the role of vitamin A supplementation in the prevention of acute URTIs in children up to seven years of age. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included six studies (27,351 participants). Four studies were RCTs and two were cluster-RCTs. The included studies were all conducted in lower-middle-income countries (two in India, two in South Africa, one in Ecuador, and one in Haiti). Three studies included healthy children who had no vitamin A deficiency, one study included children born to HIV-infected women, one study included low-birthweight neonates, and one study included children in areas with a high local prevalence of malnutrition and xerophthalmia. In two studies, vitamin E was a co-treatment administered in addition to vitamin A. We judged the included studies to be at either a high or unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, incomplete outcome data, and blinding. Primary outcomes Six studies reported the incidence of acute URTIs during the study period. Five studies reported the number of acute URTIs over a period of time, but there was population heterogeneity and the results were presented in different forms, therefore only three studies were meta-analysed. We are uncertain of the effect of vitamin A supplementation on the number of acute URTIs over two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.09; I2 = 44%; 3 studies, 22,668 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported the proportion of participants with an acute URTI. We are uncertain of the effect of vitamin A supplementation on the proportion of participants with an acute URTI (2 studies, 15,535 participants; low-certainty evidence). Only one study (116 participants) reported adverse events. No infant in either the placebo or vitamin A group was found to have feeding difficulties (failure to feed or vomiting), a bulging fontanelle, or neurological signs before or after vitamin A administration (very low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes Two studies (296 participants) reported the severity of subjective symptoms, presented by the mean duration of acute URTI. Vitamin A may have little to no effect on the mean duration of acute URTI (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for the use of vitamin A supplementation to prevent acute URTI is uncertain, because population, dose and duration of interventions, and outcomes vary between studies. From generally very low- to low-certainty evidence, we found that there may be no benefit in the use of vitamin A supplementation to prevent acute URTI in children up to seven years of age. More RCTs are needed to strengthen the current evidence. Future research should report over longer time frames using validated tools and consistent reporting, and ensure adequate power calculations, to allow for easier synthesis of data. Finally, it is important to assess vitamin A supplementation for preschool children with vitamin A deficiency.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A Bartholin's gland abscess is one of the most common infections in women of reproductive age. Although Bartholin's gland abscesses have been reported in prepubertal children, they are rarer in prepubertal children than in adults. Herein, we report a case of bilateral Bartholin's gland abscesses in a 4-year-old girl with vitamin A deficiency. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old girl diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder was admitted to the hospital for close examination and treatment because of persistent fever and malaise. The child was a marked fussy eater and was diagnosed with corneal ulceration and night blindness secondary to vitamin A deficiency. Both of the patient's labia were swollen, and a diagnosis of a bilateral Bartholin's gland abscess was made using computed tomography. Incisional drainage was performed under general anesthesia. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged from the hospital on day 8 after the surgery. During hospitalization, attempts were made to correct the vitamin deficiency by adding nutritional supplements to the diet. Three months after the surgery, no recurrence of abscesses was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased immunocompetence and mucosal barrier function due to vitamin A deficiency is thought to be the underlying cause of Bartholin's gland abscesses. Although prepubertal Bartholin's gland abscesses have been reported, they are rare. To the best of our knowledge, no reports of bilateral Bartholin's gland abscesses potentially caused by vitamin A deficiency have been reported. When prepubertal girls present with Bartholin's gland abscesses, the presence of immunodeficiency due to vitamin or trace element deficiency should also be considered.",

Databases were searched up to May 2023 to identify randomized clinical trials comparing data on the effects of vitamin supplementation(s) versus placebo or standard of care on the two conditions of interest. Inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality between supplemented and non-supplemented individuals. Overall, 37 articles were included: two regarded COVID-19 and long-COVID prevention and 35 records the COVID-19 management. The effects of vitamin D in preventing COVID-19 and long-COVID were contrasting. Similarly, no conclusion could be drawn on the efficacy of multivitamins, vitamin A, and vitamin B in COVID-19 management. A few positive findings were reported in some vitamin C trials but results were inconsistent in most outcomes, excluding all-cause mortality (RR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72-0.97). Vitamin D results were mixed in most aspects, including mortality, in which benefits were observed in regular administrations only (RR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.49-0.91). Despite some benefits, results were mostly contradictory. Variety in recruitment and treatment protocols might explain this heterogeneity. Better-designed studies are needed to clarify these vitamins' potential effects against SARS-CoV-2.",

Thirty rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 5). The treatments, metformin (120 mg/kg), rutin (100 mg/kg), vitamin A (43 IU/kg), and a combination of rutin (100 mg/kg) and vitamin A (43 IU/kg) were given to relevant groups of rats along with high-fructose high-fat diet for 42 days. HbA1c, D-lactate, Glyoxylase-1, Hexokinase 2, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), nuclear transcription factor-B (NF-κB), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and histological examinations were performed after 42 days. The docking simulations were conducted using Auto Dock package. The combined effects of rutin and vitamin A in treated rats significantly (p < 0.001) reduced HbA1c, hexokinase 2, and D-lactate levels while preventing cellular damage. The combination dramatically (p < 0.001) decreased MDA, CAT, and GPx in treated rats and decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 andIL-8, as well as the transcription factor NF-κB. The molecular docking investigations revealed that rutin had a strong affinity for several important biomolecules, including as NF-κB, Catalase, MDA, IL-6, hexokinase 2, and GPx. The results propose beneficial impact of rutin and vitamin A as a convincing treatment strategy to treat AGE-related disorders, such as diabetes, autism, alzheimer's, atherosclerosis.",

These tolerogenic properties of mLNs and celLNs are stably imprinted within stromal cells (SCs) by microbial signals and vitamin A (VA), respectively. Here, we report that a single, transient gastrointestinal infection in the neonatal, but not adult, period durably abrogates the efficient Treg-inducing capacity of celLNs by altering the subset composition and gene expression profile of celLNSCs. These cells carry information about the early-life pathogen encounter until adulthood and durably instruct migratory dendritic cells entering the celLN with reduced tolerogenic properties. Mechanistically, transiently reduced VA levels cause long-lasting celLN functional impairment, which can be rescued by early-life treatment with VA. Together, our data highlight the therapeutic potential of VA to prevent sequelae post gastrointestinal infections in infants.",

To elucidate the role of lung vitamin A status in EMT, several EMT markers and the expression of the proprotein convertase furin, which activates TGF-β, were analyzed in two experimental models. Our in vivo model included control rats, VAD rats, and both control rats and VAD rats, treated with RA. For the in vitro studies, human bronchoalveolar epithelial cells treated with RA were used. Our data show that EMT and furin are induced in VAD rats. Furthermore, furin expression continues to increase much more markedly after treatment of VAD rats with RA. In control rats and cell lines, an acute RA treatment induced a significant increase in furin expression, concomitant with changes in EMT markers. A ChIP assay demonstrated that RA directly regulates furin transcription. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining vitamin A levels within the physiological range since both levels below and above this range can cause adverse effects that, paradoxically, could be similar. The role of furin in EMT is discussed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation of vitamin A (VA) on the tibial growth, calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) metabolism, VA, and vitamin D (VD) deposition, and associated gene expression in goslings. METHODS: A total of 180 healthy, 1-day-old male goslings were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups (0, 9,000, and 15,000 IU VA/kg), with 6 replicates containing 10 goslings each. They were weighed and sampled on days 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. RESULTS: No addition of VA reduced VA content in the serum and liver of goslings, and supplementation of 15,000 IU/kg VA increased VA content from day 14 (p<0.05). The trend of VA concentration in the serum and liver was in line with the relative mRNA expression of retinoic acid receptor β in the jejunal mucosa. In both no addition of VA and supplementation of 15,000 IU/kg VA reduced 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-VD3) content in the serum and VD content in the liver (p<0.05). From day 28, no addition of VA or supplementation of 15,000 IU/kg VA had a negative effect on tibia length, strength, and Ca, P, and ash content in goslings (p<0.05). Tibia P content was lower in the supplementation of 15,000 IU/kg VA group than in the no addition of VA group (p<0.05). No addition of VA or supplementation of 15,000 IU/kg VA had the most effect on early serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in goslings (p<0.05). The effect of no addition of VA on the bone Gla protein (BGP) content of goslings started from day 14 (p<0.05). The relative mRNA expression of bone Gla-protein (BGLAP) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) in the liver and jejunal mucosa was decreased by either no addition of VA or supplementation of 15,000 IU/kg VA (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Both no addition of VA and supplementation of 15,000 IU/kg VA affected the mineralization process of the bone, and ultimately reduced tibial quality."

      "abstract": "A deleterious effect of elevated levels of vitamin A on bone health has been reported in clinical studies. Mechanistic studies in rodents have shown that numbers of periosteal osteoclasts are increased, while endocortical osteoclasts are simultaneously decreased by vitamin A treatment. The present study investigated the in vitro and in vivo effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the active metabolite of vitamin A, on periosteal osteoclast progenitors. Mouse calvarial bone cells were cultured in media containing ATRA, with or without the osteoclastogenic cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B-ligand (RANKL), on plastic dishes or bone discs. Whereas ATRA did not stimulate osteoclast formation alone, the compound robustly potentiated the formation of RANKL-induced bone resorbing osteoclasts. This effect was due to stimulation by ATRA (half-maximal stimulation ∼3 nM) on the numbers of macrophages/osteoclast progenitors in the bone cell cultures, as assessed by mRNA and protein expression of several macrophage and osteoclast progenitor cell markers, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B, F4/80, and CD11b, as well as by flow cytometry (FACS) analysis of CD11b+/F480+/Gr1- cells. The stimulation of macrophage numbers in the periosteal cell cultures was not mediated by increased macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-34. In contrast, ATRA did not enhance macrophages in bone marrow cell cultures. Importantly, ATRA treatment upregulated the mRNA expression of several macrophage-related genes in the periosteum of tibia in adult mice. These observations demonstrate a novel mechanism by which vitamin A enhances osteoclast formation specifically on periosteal surfaces.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic alcohol consumption is a major public health issue. The primary organ damaged by alcohol abuse is the liver, leading to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). ALD begins with hepatic steatosis and can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis; however, we have an incomplete understanding of ALD pathogenesis. Interestingly, the liver is also the major organ for vitamin A metabolism and storage, and ALD has previously been linked with altered hepatic vitamin A homeostasis. We hypothesize that alcohol-induced vitamin A depletion disrupts its normal function in the liver, contributing to the pathogenesis of ALD. To test this hypothesis, we postulated that adding copious vitamin A to the diet might alleviate ALD, and conversely, that a vitamin A deficient diet would worsen ALD. METHODS: We conducted two dietary intervention studies in mice comparing deficient (0 IU/g diet) and copious (25 IU/g diet) dietary vitamin A intake versus control (4 IU/g diet), using the NIAAA chronic-binge model of ALD. Hepatic steatosis was assessed using histopathological and biochemical approaches. Tissue Vitamin A levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Markers of ALD, hepatic inflammation and lipid metabolism were analyzed by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. RESULTS: As expected, a 0 IU/g Vitamin A diet decreased, and a 25 IU/g Vitamin A diet increased hepatic Vitamin A stores. However, alcohol induced changes in hepatic triglyceride levels, markers of hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis were not significantly different in mice consuming a copious or deficient vitamin A diet compared to control. CONCLUSIONS: Altered vitamin A intake and hepatic vitamin A storage have a minor effect on the pathogenesis of ALD. Thus, given the known link between altered retinoic acid signaling and ALD, future studies that further explore this linkage are warranted."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin A plays a key role in lung development, but there is no consensus regarding the optimal vitamin A dose and administration route in extremely low birthweight (ELBW) infants. We aimed to assess whether early postnatal additional high-dose fat-soluble enteral vitamin A supplementation versus placebo would lower the rate of moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death in ELBW infants receiving recommended basic enteral vitamin A supplementation. METHODS: This prospective, multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated phase 3 trial conducted at 29 neonatal intensive care units in Austria and Germany assessed early high-dose enteral vitamin A supplementation (5000 international units [IU]/kg per day) or placebo (peanut oil) for 28 days in ELBW infants. Eligible infants had a birthweight of more than 400 g and less than 1000 g; gestational age at birth of 32+0 weeks postmenstrual age or younger; and the need for mechanical ventilation, non-invasive respiratory support, or supplemental oxygen within the first 72 h of postnatal age after admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Participants were randomly assigned by block randomisation with variable block sizes (two and four). All participants received basic vitamin A supplementation (1000 IU/kg per day). The composite primary endpoint was moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered with EudraCT, 2013-001998-24. FINDINGS: Between March 2, 2015, and Feb 27, 2022, 3066 infants were screened for eligibility at the participating centres. 915 infants were included and randomly assigned to the high-dose vitamin A group (n=449) or the control group (n=466). Mean gestational age was 26·5 weeks (SD 2·0) and mean birthweight was 765 g (162). Moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death occurred in 171 (38%) of 449 infants in the high-dose vitamin A group versus 178 (38%) of 466 infants in the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0·99, 95% CI 0·73-1·55). The number of participants with at least one adverse event was similar between groups (256 [57%] of 449 in the high-dose vitamin A group and 281 [60%] of 466 in the control group). Serum retinol concentrations at baseline, at the end of intervention, and at 36 weeks postmenstrual age were similar in the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Early postnatal high-dose fat-soluble enteral vitamin A supplementation in ELBW infants was safe, but did not change the rate of moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death and did not substantially increase serum retinol concentrations.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder with no effective interventions for curing or modifying its progression. However, emerging research suggests that vitamin A in the diet may play a role in both the prevention and treatment of AD, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the dietary vitamin A modifies the gut microbiota and intestinal tissue transcriptome, impacting intestinal permeability and the release of inflammatory factors, thereby influencing Aβ pathology shedding light on its potential as a dietary intervention for AD prevention and treatment. METHODS: The APP/PS1-AD mouse model was employed and divided into three dietary groups: vitamin A-deficient (VAD), normal vitamin A (VAN), and vitamin A-supplemented (VAS) for a 12-week study. Neurobehavioral functions were assessed using the Morris Water Maze Test (MWM). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify levels of Diamine Oxidase (DAO), D-lactate, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-a cytokines. Serum vitamin A levels were analyzed via LC-MS/MS analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis and morphometry were performed to evaluate the deposition of Aβ in brain tissue. The gut microbiota of APP/PS1 mice was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis was conducted on intestinal tissue from APP/PS1 mice. RESULTS: No significant changes in food intake and body weight were observed among the groups. However, the VAD and VAS groups showed reduced food intake compared to the VAN group at various time points. In terms of cognitive function, the VAN group performed better in the Morris Water Maze Test, indicating superior learning and memory abilities. The VAD and VAS groups exhibited impaired performance, with the VAS group performing relatively better than the VAD group. Serum vitamin A concentrations differed significantly among the groups, with the VAS group having the highest concentration. Aβ levels were significantly higher in the VAD group compared to both the VAN and VAS groups. Microbial analysis revealed that the VAS and VAN groups had higher microbial diversity than the VAD group, with specific taxa characterizing each group. The VAN group was characterized by taxa such as Actinohacteriota and Desulfovibrionaceae, while the VAD group was characterized by Parabacteroides and Tannerellaceae. The VAS group showed similarities with both VAN and VAD groups, with taxa like Desulfobacterota and Desulfovibrionaceae being present. The VAD vs. VAS, VAD vs. VAN, and VAS vs. VAN comparisons identified 571, 313, and 243 differentially expressed genes, respectively, which associated with cellular and metabolic processes, and pathway analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to chemical carcinogenesis, drug metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and immune-related processes. The VAD group exhibited higher levels of D-lactate, diamine oxidase, and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1β, IL-6) compared to the VAN and VAS groups. CONCLUSION: Dietary vitamin A supplementation modulates the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, inflammatory factors, and Aβ protein formation, offering insights into the pathogenesis of AD and potential therapeutic avenues for further exploration. This research highlights the intricate interplay between diet, gut microbiota, and neurodegenerative processes, emphasizing the importance of dietary interventions in managing AD-related pathologies."

      "abstract": "Vitamin A supplements are used by many people, and the number of newly registered dietary supplements is continuously increasing. The preparations fall under food law and are not subject to the strict controls of pharmaceuticals. Risk indications and maximum quantity recommendations, e.g., from the Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung (BfR) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are not binding, which means that overdoses and potentially serious health problems can easily occur. The hepatotoxicity and teratogenicity of vitamin A are well documented, and other negative effects of high doses of vitamin A are also being discussed. Nevertheless, preparations with exorbitantly high doses are freely available for sale and unrestricted. In this study, 75 supplements containing vitamin A available in Germany and 26 available in the USA were critically examined on the basis of various parameters such as the recommended daily dose according to the manufacturer, daily therapy costs (DTC), the presence of warnings about overdose, use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and information on adverse effects/interactions. The aim was to gain insights into their risk potential and to examine the need for closer monitoring and stricter guidelines for these preparations. The results show some considerable country-specific differences. Overall, there are serious deficiencies in compliance with the labeling requirements for both the German and the US preparations, and the dosages are often far too high in view of the applicable expert recommendations. Overall, these deficits can pose a risk for consumers that is difficult to assess in its entirety, especially for vulnerable consumer groups. It should be noted that the US preparations perform better overall than the German preparations. This suggests better regulation of dietary supplements in the US market. Based on the available data and literature research, it is doubtful whether the intake of vitamin A-containing preparations, without a diagnosed vitamin A deficiency, has a positive health benefit. Furthermore, it should be examined whether vitamin A should continue to be offered over-the-counter as a food supplement.",

Initial serum vitamin A concentrations were low (140 nmol/L) for ML. Calvarial hyperostosis was confirmed using computed tomography (CT) of the head and cervical vertebrae in each cub. CT measurements were adapted in relation to the skull width. ML showed the most pronounced thickening of the tentorium cerebelli and occipital bone, represented by a tentorium cerebelli to skull width ratio (TCR) of 0.08 (FL 1: 0.06, FL 2: 0.05) and a basisphenoid to skull width ratio (BBR) of 0.07 (FL 1: 0.06, FL 2: 0.04). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed cerebellar herniation and cervical intramedullary T2-weighted hyperintensity from C1, extending caudally for at least two cervical vertebrae in all cubs. Treatment was initiated with subcutaneous vitamin A supplementation and feeding of whole carcasses. Improvement in ataxia was noticed 3 wk later. Follow-up CT and MRI examinations were performed in ML after 3 and 8 mon. The affected bones appeared slightly less thickened and TCR and BBR had decreased to 0.05 after 3 mon. The cerebellum remained mildly herniated, accompanied by amelioration of cervical T2w hyperintensities. After 8 mon, evaluation and diagnostic imaging revealed further improvement regarding the neurologic status and measurements (TCR 0.05, BBR 0.04) despite persistence of a subtle cerebellar herniation. In conclusion, bone remodeling and improvement in clinical signs may be achievable in young lion cubs presented with calvarial hyperostosis and may be attributable to high-dose vitamin A supplementation.",

Nutritional interventions, such as zinc and vitamin A supplementation, are gaining attention for their therapeutic potential in enhancing recovery and minimizing pneumonia severity in pediatric patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the therapeutic benefits of zinc and vitamin A supplementation in pediatric CAP patients under five years old and to advocate for their use in clinical settings. METHODOLOGY: Three groups were formed in a randomized controlled trial conducted from October 2022 to September 2023, to address zinc and vitamin A supplementation in pediatric patients under five years old in the intensive care unit with severe pneumonia. Group 1 received zinc supplementation, group 2 received vitamin A supplementation, and group 3 served as the control group, receiving antibiotic treatment exclusively for pneumonia. This treatment comprised either a β-lactam (amoxicillin-clavulanate, commonly referred to as Augmentin) administered orally at 500 mg/125 mg three times a day, Augmentin 875 mg/125 mg orally twice daily, or Augmentin 2000 mg/125 mg orally once daily. Additionally, the control group received a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) or doxycycline at a dosage of 100 mg orally twice daily. Linear regression analysis identified statistically significant decreases in both length of hospital stay and active pneumonic effusion. RESULTS: The study encompassed 90 pediatric pneumonia patients with an age range of six to 55 months. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that both vitamin A and zinc led to a significant decrease in hospitalization length by 2.39 days (p < 0.01, 95% CI: 4.19-0.47) and 3.17 days (p < 0.01, 95% CI: 5.19-1.31), respectively. In comparison to the control group, both the vitamin A and zinc supplementation groups were linked to a shorter pneumonic effusion duration (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Both interventions significantly reduced the duration of hospitalization (2.39 days for vitamin A and 3.17 days for zinc) and pneumonic effusion compared to the control group. These findings highlight the potential of zinc and vitamin A as valuable additions to standard CAP treatment regimens, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes and reduced healthcare burdens."

The child's symptoms, unresponsive to initial treatment at two hospitals, led to the discovery of elevated liver enzymes and subsequent referral to a tertiary care center. Clinical examination revealed hepatomegaly, abdominal distension, and non-palpable spleen. Laboratory findings confirmed acute hepatitis, prompting further investigation into the child's dietary history and revealing a potential foodborne infection. The child was diagnosed with hepatitis-associated severe vitamin A deficiency, manifested by Bitot's spots on ophthalmic examination. Prompt initiation of antiviral therapy, nutritional supplementation, and supportive care resulted in a positive clinical response, with resolution of symptoms and normalization of liver enzymes. This case underscores the importance of recognizing nutritional deficiencies in the context of infectious diseases, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach to patient care. The successful management of this complex case highlights the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration in ensuring optimal outcomes in pediatric patients with overlapping infectious and nutritional etiologies."

The coverage of vitamin A supplementation and deworming medication (VASD) provided through mass campaigns is generally high, yet with a cost that is not sustainable, while coverage offered through routine health services is low. Alternative strategies are needed that achieve the recommended coverage of >80% of children twice annually and can be managed by health systems with limited resources. We undertook a study from September to December 2021 to compare the feasibility and coverage of VASD locally delivered by community health volunteers (CHV) (\"intervention arm\") to that achieved by the bi-annual Malezi Bora campaign event (\"control arm\"). This comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in sub-counties of Siaya County using both qualitative and quantitative methods. VASD were offered through the CHS in Alego Usonga and through Malezi Bora in Bondo Sub-County. Coverage was assessed by a post-event coverage survey among caregivers of children aged 6-59 months (n = 307 intervention; n = 318 control). Key informant interviews were conducted with n = 43 personnel across both modalities, and 10 focus group discussions were conducted with caregivers of children aged 6-59 months to explore knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of the two strategies. VAS coverage by CHV was 90.6% [95% CI: 87.3-93.9] compared to 70.4% [95% CI: 65.4-75.4] through the Malezi Bora, while deworming coverage was 73.9% [95% CI: 69.0-78.7] and 54.7% [95% CI: 49.2-60.2], respectively. With sufficient training and oversight, CHV can achieve superior coverage to campaigns.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin A (VA) and its metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), are of great interest for their wide range of physiological functions. However, the regulatory contribution of VA to mitochondrial and muscle fiber composition in sheep has not been reported. METHOD: Lambs were injected with 0 (control) or 7,500 IU VA palmitate into the biceps femoris muscle on d 2 after birth. At the age of 3 and 32 weeks, longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle samples were obtained to explore the effect of VA on myofiber type composition. In vitro, we investigated the effects of RA on myofiber type composition and intrinsic mechanisms. RESULTS: The proportion of type I myofiber was greatly increased in VA-treated sheep in LD muscle at harvest. VA greatly promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and function in LD muscle of sheep. Further exploration revealed that VA elevated PGC-1α mRNA and protein contents, and enhanced the level of p38 MAPK phosphorylation in LD muscle of sheep. In addition, the number of type I myofibers with RA treatment was significantly increased, and type IIx myofibers was significantly decreased in primary myoblasts. Consistent with in vivo experiment, RA significantly improved mitochondrial biogenesis and function in primary myoblasts of sheep. We then used si-PGC-1α to inhibit PGC-1α expression and found that si-PGC-1α significantly abrogated RA-induced the formation of type I myofibers, mitochondrial biogenesis, MitoTracker staining intensity, UQCRC1 and ATP5A1 expression, SDH activity, and enhanced the level of type IIx muscle fibers. These data suggested that RA improved mitochondrial biogenesis and function by promoting PGC-1α expression, and increased type I myofibers. In order to prove that the effect of RA on the level of PGC-1α is caused by p38 MAPK signaling, we inhibited the p38 MAPK signaling using a p38 MAPK inhibitor, which significantly reduced RA-induced PGC-1α and MyHC I levels. CONCLUSION: VA promoted PGC-1α expression through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, improved mitochondrial biogenesis, and altered the composition of muscle fiber type."

      "abstract": "Normal differentiation and proliferation of cells are essential for maintaining homeostasis. Following the successful completion of whole genome sequencing, protein modification has been attracted increasing attention in order to understand the roles of protein diversification in protein function and to elucidate molecular targets in mechanisms of signal transduction. Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for health maintenance. It is present as β-carotene in green and yellow vegetables and retinyl ester in animal products and absorbed into the body from the intestines. After ingestion, it is converted to retinol and oxidized in target cells to retinal, which plays critical roles in vision. It is then further oxidized to retinoic acid (RA), which exhibits a number of effects prior to being metabolized by cytochrome P450 and excreted from the body. Since RA exhibits cell differentiation-inducing actions, it is used as a therapeutic agent for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The current paper describes: (1) HL60 cell differentiation and cell differentiation induction therapy by RA; (2) roles played by RA and retinal and their mechanisms of action; (3) retinoylation, post-translational protein-modified by RA, a novel non-genomic RA mechanism of action without RA receptor; (4) new actions of β-carotene and retinol in vivo and (5) potent anticancer effects of p-dodecylaminophenol (p-DDAP), a novel vitamin A derivative created from the RA derivative fenretinide. We propose that nutritional management of vitamin A can be effective at preventing and treating diseases, and that p-DDAP is a promising anticancer drug.",

Methods: A single-center, prospective, randomized, parallel controlled trial design was used to include patients diagnosed with MGD-associated dry eye. The patients were randomly divided into three groups and administered with medications binocularly for 12 weeks. The CsA+VA group was given 0.05% cyclosporine A eye drops twice a day and vitamin A palmitate eye gel three times a day. The CsA+HA group was given 0.05% cyclosporine A eye drops twice a day and 0.1% sodium hyaluronate eye drops three times a day. The HA group was given 0.1% sodium hyaluronate eye drops 3 times a day. The OSDI score, tear meniscus height, fluorescein tear break-up time, Schirmer Ⅰ test (without anesthesia), tear film lipid layer thickness, meibomian gland morphology and function examination, and corneal fluorescein sodium staining score were evaluated at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the initiation of the treatment, respectively. Results: A total of 120 patients with MGD-related dry eye met the enrollment criteria, but 10 patients were lost to follow-up; 110 patients were finally included for observation, including 36 patients in the CsA+VA group, 38 in the CsA+HA group and 36 in the HA group. The OSDI score, tear meniscus height, fluorescein tear break-up time and meibomian gland secretion of the 3 groups were significantly improved. At the 12th week of the treatment, the differences of the CsA+VA group [25.45±15.11, (0.30±0.13) mm, (3.72±1.40) s, (5.03±2.52) points] and the CsA+HA group [26.98±16.89, (0.27±0.10) mm, (4.34±1.76) s, (5.11±2.39) points] from the HA group [24.57±11.26, (0.24±0.06) mm, (3.18±1.11) s, (9.11±3.34) points] were statistically significant (P<0.05). Compared with the CsA+HA group [(68.39±26.66) nm], the tear film lipid layer thickness in the CsA+VA group [(72.61±23.65) nm] was significantly increased (P<0.05). In the CsA+VA group, the meibomian gland secretion characters and discharge capacity among patients with severe abnormalities [(6.28±2.59) and (5.89±2.77) points at the 12th week of treatment], moderate abnormalities [(4.27±2.02) and (4.64±2.02) points at the 12th week of treatment] and mild abnormalities [(2.80±0.84) and (2.60±0.55) points at the 12th week of treatment] were significantly different (P<0.05). Conclusion: 0.05% cyclosporine A combined with vitamin A palmitate can significantly improve the symptoms and signs of patients with MGD-related dry eye, especially the tear film lipid layer thickness and the meibomian gland secretion characters and discharge capacity in severe cases.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To report our findings of reduced full-field electroretinograms (ff-ERGs) and abnormal optical coherence tomographic (OCT) images in a patient with poor visual acuity after cataract surgery who was eventually diagnosed with vitamin A deficiency (VAD). METHODS: This was a clinical study of a patient who complained of blurred vision after cataract surgery. To determine the cause of the reduced vision, we recorded full-field electroretinograms (ff-ERGs) to determine the scotopic and photopic status of the retina. We also performed optical coherence tomography to assess the changes in the retinal structure. Serological tests were performed. RESULTS: A 74-year-old man presented with persistent corneal epithelial damages and reduced vision that developed after conventional cataract surgery. OCT showed an interrupted ellipsoid zone, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) showed a severe hypofluorescence in the retina of the left eye. The scotopic ff-ERGs were severely reduced, and the photopic ff-ERGs were mildly reduced. Serological examinations revealed a vitamin A concentration < 7 IU/dL (normal, 97-316 IU/dL). Based on these findings, we diagnosed the patient with VAD and started treatment with oral vitamin A supplements. After three months, his visual acuity, ff-ERGs, and OCT findings recovered to normal levels. The amplitudes and implicit times of the RETeval flicker ERGs increased to be within the normal range, and the hypofluorescence of the left eye disappeared. The length of the photoreceptor outer segments increased after the vitamin A supplementation. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the ERGs are helpful for diagnosing patients with VAD associated with persistent corneal epithelial damages.",

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of red palm olein (RPO)-enriched biscuit supplementation in improving vitamin A, haematological, iron, and inflammatory status among vitamin A-deficient schoolchildren. METHODS: We conducted a double-blinded, randomised controlled trial involving 651 rural primary schoolchildren (8-12 years) with VAD in Malaysia. The schoolchildren were randomised to receive either RPO-enriched biscuits (experimental group, n = 334) or palm olein-enriched biscuits (control group, n = 317) for 6-month duration. RESULTS: Significant improvements in retinol and retinol-binding protein 4 levels were observed in both groups after supplementation (P < 0.001). The improvement in retinol levels were similar across groups among subjects with confirmed VAD (P = 0.40). Among those with marginal VAD, greater improvement in retinol levels was recorded in the control group (P < 0.001) but lacked clinical significance. The levels of α- and β-carotenes, haematological parameters (haemoglobin, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin) and iron enhanced more significantly in the experimental group (P < 0.05). The significant reduction in the prevalence of microcytic anaemia (- 21.8%) and high inflammation (- 8.1%) was only observed in the experimental group. CONCLUSION: The supplementation of RPO-enriched biscuits enhanced levels of provitamin A carotenes, iron, and erythropoiesis, and exhibited anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, the incorporation of RPO into National Nutritional Intervention Programs may be a potential measure to improve the health status of vitamin A-deficient children, among various other interventions.

Herein, we estimated the association between rare genetic variations in 410 vitamin A (VA)-related genes (VARGs) and ASD aetiology using publicly available de novo mutations (DNMs), rare inherited variants, and copy number variations (CNVs) from about 50,000 ASD probands and 20,000 normal controls (discovery and validation cohorts). Additionally, given the functional relevance of VA and oxytocin, we systematically compared the similarities and differences between VA and oxytocin with respect to ASD aetiology and evaluated their potential for clinical applications. Functional DNMs and pathogenic CNVs in VARGs contributed to ASD pathogenesis in the discovery and validation cohorts. Additionally, 324 potential VA-related biomarkers were identified, 243 of which were shared with previously identified oxytocin-related biomarkers, while 81 were unique VA biomarkers. Moreover, multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that both VA- and oxytocin-related biomarkers were able to predict ASD aetiology for individuals carrying functional DNM in corresponding biomarkers with an average precision of 0.94. As well as, convergent and divergent functions were also identified between VA- and oxytocin-related biomarkers. The findings of this study provide a basis for future studies aimed at understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ASD while also defining a set of potential molecular biomarkers for adjuvant diagnosis and intervention in ASD."

In this context, we hypothesized that serum vitamin K levels are associated with MSD in preschool children, and the widely used vitamin A and vitamin D supplements may mediate these associations based on potential mechanisms, which expects to provide guidance for future practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Sichuan province in southwestern China, from January 2021 to May 2022. Serum levels of vitamin K1/K2 and 25(OH)D were determined using the high-performance liquid chromatography method, and the diagnosis of MSD was executed by clinicians. Overall and stratified logistic regression analysis based on categorized 25(OH)D levels were conducted to assess association between serum vitamin K levels and MSD prevalence after adjusting for confounders. Mediation analysis was further performed and vitamin A and D supplementation was regressed as the mediator. RESULTS: A total of 6,368 children aged 0-6 years old were enrolled. MSD was identified in 1179 (18.51%) of the children, while 5,189 (81.49%) of them did not present such disorder. After adjusting confounders, a significant difference was found in serum vitamin K1 level between children in MSD and Non-MSD group (OR = 0.802, 95%CI 0.745-0.864). No significant difference was found in serum vitamin K2 level between the two groups (OR = 0.975, 95%CI 0.753-1.261). The association between vitamin K1 level and MSD prevalence was partly (36.8%) mediated by vitamin A and D supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: A low serum vitamin K1 level is connected with an increased risk of MSD among children, highlighting that vitamin A and D supplementation is a helpful intervention to prevent MSD in children with vitamin K deficiency."

After adjusting confounding variables such as age, sex, smoking, cholesterol, diabetes prevalence period, glycated hemoglobin levels, and high blood pressure, the odd ratio (OR) of vitamin A at quartile level 4 for diabetic retinopathy was 0.32 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.72, P for trend < 0.001). In male, the OR of quartile 3 level vitamin A for diabetic retinopathy was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.01-0.69, P for trend = 0.010). In adults under the age of 60, the OR of vitamin A at quartile level 3 for diabetic retinopathy was 0.10. (95% CI, 0.03-0.29, P for trend < 0.001). Serum vitamin A high levels are associated with low risk of diabetic retinopathy. Particularly, there is a more effective relationship in male and adults under the age of 60.",

BS are particularly prevalent in developing countries, and their presence necessitates prompt vitamin A supplementation to avert blindness, with the immunohistochemical characteristics of BS aiding in understanding the extent of epithelial abnormalities and the efficacy of vitamin A supplementation. We describe the case of a 34-year-old male with persistent BS despite extensive vitamin A supplementation and topical treatments who underwent surgical excision of the BS followed by amniotic membrane transplantation, thus resulting in symptom relief and epithelialization, with no recurrence observed during follow-up. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluations revealed expression of keratinization-related proteins, along with an absence of mucin-5AC-positive cells, suggesting impaired differentiation into goblet cells due to VAD. This case highlights the potential age-related disparity in the efficacy of vitamin A supplementation, emphasizing the need for early detection and a multidisciplinary approach in the management of VAD, especially in young adults. The favorable outcome of surgical intervention highlights its viability in the management of persistent BS and encourages further investigation to optimize therapeutic strategies for VAD-related ocular manifestations."

This report investigated whether neonatal intramuscular VA injection affected antioxidative activity and meat quality in longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of lambs. METHODS: Lambs were injected with 0 (control) or 7,500 IU VA palmitate into the biceps femoris muscle on day 2 after birth. At 3, 12, and 32 weeks of age, blood samples were collected in the jugular vein for serum levels of RA and muscle samples were collected in the biceps femoris for analysis of relative mRNA expression of enzyme contributors to retinoid metabolism. All animals were harvested at 32 weeks of age and muscle samples were collected to explore the role of VA on the meat quality and antioxidant capacity of lambs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results indicated that VA increased the redness, crude protein, and crude fat (p < 0.05), without affecting moisture, ash, and amino acid composition in LD muscle (p > 0.05). In addition, VA increased catalase (CAT) activity and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in LD muscle (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, greater levels of CAT and NRF2 mRNA and protein contents with VA treatment were observed in LD muscle (p < 0.05), partly explained by the increased level of RA (p < 0.05). Collectively, our findings indicated that VA injection at birth could improve lamb meat quality by elevating the redness, crude protein, crude fat, and antioxidative capacity in LD muscle of lambs."

Retinol, especially in the form of retinyl ester, can be found in many animal-based products and is essential for the efficient operation of many physiological processes. Fruits and vegetables are also excellent sources of vitamin A; the majority of them include carotenoids, which are precursors to vitamin A. The human body has the ability to convert natural retinols like retinyl ester, retinoic acid, and provitamin A into biologically active forms that interact with a variety of molecular targets like nuclear receptors and retinal opsins. This review article provides knowledge regarding retinol deficiency in humans. It provides brief information about the sources, etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of vitamin A deficiency."

In this work, we used Caenorhabditis elegans to study the impact of various bioactive compounds on lifespan. We demonstrate that VA extends lifespan and reduces lipofuscin and fat accumulation while increasing resistance to heat and oxidative stress. This resistance can be attributed to high levels of detoxifying enzymes called glutathione S-transferases, induced by the transcription factor skinhead-1 (SKN-1). Notably, VA upregulated the transcript levels of skn-1 or its mammalian ortholog NRF2 in both C. elegans, human cells, and liver tissues of mice. Moreover, the loss-of-function genetic models demonstrated a critical involvement of the SKN-1 pathway in longevity extension by VA. Our study thus provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism of anti-aging and anti-oxidative effects of VA, suggesting that this micronutrient could be used for the prevention and/or treatment of age-related disorders.",

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on these nutrients and vitamins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was performed in Tehran and all the patients who met the inclusion criteria before the surgery were tested for serum levels of vitamins A, B12, D, ferritin, serum iron, and TIBC. The patients were tested once again for the same micronutrients, one year after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients had the inclusion criteria and all of them completed the follow-up period. Of the patients, 64.2% (77 patients) were female and 35.8% (43 patients) were male. The mean weight of the patients was 122.1 ± 14.8 kg and the mean BMI of patients before surgery was 43.6 ± 4.4 kg/m2. Comparing these parameters before and after surgery showed that serum levels of vitamins A and B12, ferritin, and TIBC were not significantly different from before surgery. However, vitamin D levels after surgery were significantly higher than before (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The result of the present study demonstrated that laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is one of the most effective surgical methods for obesity treatment and does not cause a lack of nutrients and vitamins in long term and does not require supplementation. In addition, it promotes serum levels of vitamin D, which is effective in preventing the effects of vitamin D deficiency in obese patients."

Inadequate vitamin A intake during this critical period can lead to anemia, weakened immune function, night blindness, and increased susceptibility to infections. Conversely, excessive intake of vitamin A can result in birth defects, hypercalcemia, and psychiatric symptoms. This review aims to identify risk factors contributing to vitamin A deficiency in pregnant women and its impact on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. It also examines the effects of high-dose vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy on offspring health. By analyzing existing literature and recommendations, the review emphasizes the significance of vitamin A in the development of various body systems and organs. It provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of vitamin A during pregnancy and lactation, encompassing deficiencies, excessive intake, and supplementation guidelines. The need for further research in this field is highlighted. In conclusion, maintaining a balanced vitamin A status is crucial during pregnancy to promote better outcomes for fetuses and newborns. Effective monitoring and intervention strategies are essential to address vitamin A deficiency and excess in pregnant women, thereby improving fetal and neonatal health.",

However, vitamin A deficiency can be caused by malabsorption resulting from bowel resection or medication. In this retrospective study, we present five cases of vitamin A deficiency retinopathy related to malabsorption secondary to medical interventions. METHODS: Electronic charts over a ten-year period (2012-2022) were screened for vitamin A deficiency retinopathy. Only patients with vitamin A deficiency confirmed by laboratory tests were included. Symptoms, medical history, visual acuity, optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, electrophysiological examination, and vitamin A levels were reviewed. RESULTS: Five eligible cases were identified. Median age was 44.7 years (range 22.2-88.9), median duration of ocular symptoms prior to diagnosis was 14 months, and median visual acuity was 1.0 (range 0.5-1.0, Snellen, decimal). Three patients had a history of bariatric surgery, one patient had a small bowel resection and was on octreotide treatment, and one patient suffered from cystic fibrosis and had a history of small bowel resection and severe hepatopathy. Optical coherence tomography showed various abnormalities, including a reduced interdigitation zone, subretinal drusenoid deposits, and a thinned outer nuclear layer. Electroretinogram findings ranged from abnormal oscillatory potentials to non-recordable rod responses. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin A deficiency retinopathy can occur following medical interventions associated with malabsorption. In cases of night blindness, vitamin A levels should be measured.",

OBSERVATIONS: A 51-year-old female with SJS secondary to lamotrigine use presented for follow up evaluation. Ocular history was significant for acute SJS twenty-four years prior with chronic ocular surface sequelae predominantly affecting the left eye. The condition had been stabilized without progression by utilizing long term PROSE daytime wear along with nightly application of topical ophthalmic vitamin A ointment. The patient reported non-compliance with vitamin A ointment use for the prior three months. The ocular surface examination of the left eye was notable for significantly progressed inferior keratinization and neovascularization which had been unchanged over the course of the three prior annual exams. After restarting nightly topical ophthalmic vitamin A ointment and continuing regular PROSE use, there was no further ocular surface disease progression in the ensuing 4 years of follow up. CONCLUSION AND IMPORTANCE: The use of nightly topical ophthalmic vitamin A ointment may be a viable adjuvant therapy alongside daily PROSE use for progressive chronic SJS ocular surface disease."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Smell loss is a common problem with an estimated 5% of the population having no functioning sense of smell. Viral causes of smell loss are the second most common cause and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is estimated to have caused 20,000 more people this year to have a lasting loss of smell. Isolation, depression, anxiety, and risk of danger from hazards such as toxic gas and spoiled food are all negative impacts. It also affects appetite with weight loss/gain in two-thirds of those affected. Phantosmia or smell distortion can also occur making most foods seem unpalatable. Smell training has been tried with good results in the immediate post-viral phase. Evidence behind treatment with steroids has not shown to have proven effectiveness. With this, a key problem for patients and their clinicians is the lack of proven effective therapeutic treatment options. Based on previous studies, there is some evidence supporting the regenerative potential of retinoic acid, the metabolically active form of vitamin A in the regeneration of olfactory receptor neurons. It is based on this concept that we have chosen vitamin A as our study comparator. AIM: To undertake a two-arm randomised trial of intranasally delivered vitamin A vs no intervention to determine proof of concept. METHODS/DESIGN: The study will compare 10,000 IU once daily Vitamin A self-administered intranasal drops versus peanut oil drops (placebo) delivered over 12 weeks in patients with post-viral olfactory loss. Potentially eligible patients will be recruited from the Smell & Taste Clinic and via the charity Fifth Sense. They will be invited to attend the Brain Imaging Centre at the University of East Anglia on two occasions, 3 months apart. If they meet the eligibility criteria, they will be consented to enter the study and randomised to receive vitamin A drops or no treatment in a 2:1 ratio. MRI scanning will enable volumetric measurement of the OB and ROS; fMRI will then be conducted using an olfactometer to deliver pulsed odours-phenethylalcohol (rose-like) and hydrogen sulphide (rotten eggs). Participants will also perform a standard smell test at both visits as well as complete a quality-of-life questionnaire. Change in OB volume will be the primary outcome measure. DISCUSSION: We expect the outputs of this study to enable a subsequent randomised controlled trial of Vitamin A versus placebo. With PPI input we will make the outputs publicly available using journals, conferences, and social media via Fifth Sense. We have already prepared a draft RCT proposal in partnership with the Norwich Clinical Trials Unit and plan to develop this further in light of the findings.

A total of 1920 chickens were distributed in a randomised design, considering six vitamin A supplementation levels (0, 6000, 16,000, 26,000, 36,000, and 46,000 IU kg-1 ), with 16 replicates and 20 chickens per experimental unit, established due to rising the range of vitamin levels observed in the literature to evaluate the effect of vitamin A on broilers. At 22 days, half of the replicates from each treatment continued receiving the initial diet, and the other eight repetitions received diets without vitamin A (0 IU kg-1 ) until 42 days. The level of vitamin A influenced feed intake (FI) and body weight gain (BWG) until 21 days for all treatments. Broilers at 21 days of age had a more significant BWG at a vitamin A supplementation level of 28,209 IU kg-1 . At 42 days, vitamin A influenced the BWG and FI of broilers at treatments that were not supplemented after 21 days. Treatments supplemented up to 42 days showed quadratic responses to vitamin A for BWG, FI, and feed conversion. The vitamin A levels influenced the relative weights of the small intestine, pancreas, gizzard, abdominal fat, Seedor index, and breaking strength at 42 days, where the adequate supplementation of vitamin A improved these characteristics in broilers. Vitamin A supplementation from 22 to 42 days old did not affect broiler performance. An increased BWG was obtained when vitamin A supplementation occurred until 42 days, with supplementation of 29,375 IU kg-1 and a lower response of feed conversion with the addition of 27,775 IU kg-1 .",

In this review, we discuss how 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) individually or in conjunction, signal through their nuclear receptors and thereby impact B cell differentiation, immunoglobulin class switching to IgA at the expense of IgE, and also B cell migration and homing. Impact of the vitamin metabolites individually on B cell survival factors are well elucidated, be it the regulation of BAFF and APRIL, the induction of TGF-β or suppression of NF-κB. Very little is known about the impact of 9cRA and calcitriol together on B cells. Recently our group revealed that 9cRA and calcitriol together in the context of the B cell differentiation, induces naïve B cell differentiation into IgA+ plasmablasts, the functional and underlying molecular regulations however require further investigation. In conclusion, the conjunctional impact of these nuclear receptor ligands on B cell functionality is important to better understand B cell dependent clinical outcomes in allergy and autoimmunity. Within this review, we hypothesize that a balance between both vitamins is of utmost importance to provide a robust humoral immune response and a better treatment of disorders characterised by dysregulated immune responses such as IgE-dependent allergy or autoimmunity such as lupus erythematosus.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin A has long been associated with bladder cancer, and many exogenous vitamin A supplements, vitamin A derivatives, and synthetic drugs have been investigated over the years. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in clinical practice has not met expectations, and they have not been widely adopted. Recent medical research on intestinal flora has revealed that bladder cancer patients exhibit reduced serum vitamin A levels and an imbalance of gut microbiota. In light of the close relationship between gut microbiota and vitamin A, one can speculate that a complex regulatory mechanism exists between the two in the development and occurrence of bladder cancer. As such, further exploration of their interaction in bladder cancer may help guide the use of vitamin A for preventive purposes. During the course of this review, attention is paid to the influence of intestinal microbiota on the vitamin A metabolism and the RA signaling pathway, as well as the mutual promotion relationships between them in the prevention of bladder cancer, In addition, it emphasizes the importance of intestinal microbiota for bladder cancer prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "β-Carotene, because it is the precursor of vitamin A and has versatile biological roles, has been applied as a feed additive in the poultry industry for a long time. In this study, we investigated the deposition and bioconversion of β-carotene in laying hens. A total of 600 Hy-line brown laying hens at 40 wk of age were randomly divided into 5 dietary treatments, each group's dietary supplemental levels of β-carotene were 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 mg/kg feed, and the vitamin A levels were all 8,000 IU/kg. After 14-wk trial, samples were collected, then carotenoids and different forms of vitamin A were detected using the novel method developed by our laboratory. We found that dietary β-carotene treatment had no significant effects on laying hens' production performance and egg quality (P > 0.05), except the yolk color. The deposition of β-carotene in the body gradually increased (P < 0.01) with the supplemental dose, whereas the contents of lutein and zeaxanthin decreased (P < 0.05). When the β-carotene supplemental level was above 30 mg/kg in the diet, the different forms of vitamin A in in serum, liver, ovary, and yolks were increased compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, these indicators decreased when the additional dose was 120 mg/kg. Moreover, the mRNA levels of the genes involved in β-carotene absorption, bioconversion, and negative feedback regulation in duodenal mucosa and liver were upregulated after long-term feeding (P < 0.05). Histological staining of the ovaries indicated that the deposition of β-carotene led to a lower rate of follicle atresia (P < 0.05), and this positive effects may be related to the antioxidant function of β-carotene, which caused a reduction of oxidation products in the ovary (P < 0.05). Altogether, β-carotene could accumulate in laying hens intactly and exert its biological functions in tissue. Meanwhile, a part of β-carotene could also be converted into vitamin A but this bioconversion has an upper limit and negative feedback regulation."

      "abstract": "Vitamin A (VA) plays an essential role in modulating both the gut microbiota and gut barrier function. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as metabolites of the gut microbiota, protect the physiological intestinal barrier; however, they are compromised when VA is deficient. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how and which SCFAs modulate colonic epithelial barrier integrity in VA deficiency (VAD). Herein, compared with normal VA rats (VAN), at the beginning of pregnancy, we confirmed that the colonic desmosome junction was impaired in the VAD group, and the amounts of acetate, propionate, and butyrate declined because of the decreased abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria (Romboutsia, Collinsella, and Allobaculum). The differentially expressed genes correlated with the gut barrier and the histone deacetylase complex between the VAD and VAN groups were enriched by RNA sequencing. In the VAD group, the expression levels of colonic CEA cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) were down-regulated, and the levels of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC3 were up-regulated. Intriguingly, the above changes in the VAD groups were rescued by VA supplementation in the early postnatal period. Further study indicated that in Caco-2 cells, butyrate treatment significantly repressed the enrichment of HDAC3 on the promoter of the CEACAM1 gene to induce its expression. Our findings support that butyrate intervention can alleviate the impairment of colonic barrier function caused by VAD, and timely postnatal VA intervention may reverse the damage caused by VAD on gut barrier integrity during pregnancy."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To explore the risk factors and fundus imaging features of vitamin A deficiency retinopathy (VADR) in an academic tertiary referral center in Atlanta, GA, United States, and to propose guidance regarding diagnostic workup and management of affected patients. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective case series. SUBJECTS: Nine patients seen between 2015 and 2021 at the Emory Eye Center diagnosed with VADR. METHODS: Retrospective chart review. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline serum retinol level, Snellen visual acuity, multimodal fundus imaging findings, and electroretinography findings. RESULTS: Nine patients, 4 (44.4%) female, with a median (range) age of 68 (50-75) years were identified. The most common underlying etiologies for vitamin A deficiency included history of gastrointestinal surgery (55.6%), liver disease (44.4%), and nutritional depletion due to low-quality diet (44.4%). Only 1 (11.1%) patient had a history of bariatric surgery. Four (44.4%) patients were on some form of vitamin A supplementation before the diagnosis of VADR. Median (range) serum retinol level was 0.06 (< 0.06-0.19) mg/L. All patients had macular subretinal hyperreflective deposits resembling subretinal drusenoid deposits, although in some cases, these were scant and sparsely distributed. Six eyes of 3 patients with longstanding deficiency had defects in the external limiting membrane (ELM). Three of these eyes additionally had macular areas of complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA). Full-field electroretinography demonstrated severe rod dysfunction and mild to moderate cone system dysfunction. Many findings of VADR were reversible with vitamin A repletion. However, all eyes with ELM defects or cRORA had persistence or continued growth of these lesions. CONCLUSION: Vitamin A deficiency retinopathy is uncommon in the developed world. However, given that early intervention can lead to dramatic visual improvement and avoid potentially permanent retinal damage, retina specialists should be familiar with its clinical presentation. The presence of nyctalopia and subretinal hyperreflective deposits in a patient with a history of gastrointestinal surgery, liver disease, and/or poor diet can be suggestive of this diagnosis, even in the presence of ongoing vitamin A supplementation. Vitamin A supplementation can vary in route and dosage and can be tailored to the individual with serial testing of serum retinol.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Retinol-binding protein 2 (RBP2) is an intracellular carrier for vitamin A in the absorptive enterocytes. Mice lacking RBP2 (Rbp2-/-) display an unexpected phenotype of obesity, glucose intolerance, and elevated glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels. GIP and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) are incretin hormones secreted by enteroendocrine cells (EECs). We recently demonstrated the presence of RBP2 and other retinoid-related proteins in EECs. OBJECTIVES: Given RBP2's role in intracellular retinoid trafficking, we aimed to evaluate whether dietary vitamin A affects incretin-secreting cell function and gene expression. METHODS: Male Rbp2-/- mice and sex- and age-matched controls (n = 6-9) were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 18 wk containing normal (VAN, 4000 IU/kg of diet) or low (VAL, 25% of normal) vitamin A concentrations. Body weight was recorded biweekly. Plasma GIP and GLP-1 levels were obtained fasting and 30 min after an oral fat gavage at week 16. Glucose tolerance tests were also performed. Mice were killed at week 18, and blood and tissue samples were obtained. RESULTS: Rbp2-/- mice displayed greater weight gain on the VAN compared with the VAL diet from week 7 of the intervention (P ≤ 0.01). Stimulated GIP levels were elevated in Rbp2-/- mice compared with their controls fed the VAN diet (P = 0.02), whereas their GIP response was lower when fed the VAL diet (P = 0.03). Although no differences in GLP-1 levels were observed in the VAN diet group, a lower GLP-1 response was seen in Rbp2-/- mice fed the VAL diet (P = 0.02). Changes in incretin gene expression and that of other genes associated with EEC lineage and function were consistent with these observations. Circulating and hepatic retinoid levels revealed no systemic vitamin A deficiency across dietary groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a role for RBP2 and dietary vitamin A in incretin secretion and gene expression in mice fed a HFD.",

This systematic review assessed evidence of the effects of food-based approaches on the vitamin A status of women and children under 5 y. VAD was defined as clinical ocular symptoms, such as loss of vision, and/or retinol plasma or serum concentration <0.70 μmol/L. Searches on food-based approaches to improve vitamin A status were conducted for the period 2011-2022 on PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using PRISMA guidelines. English-language publications were included. Case studies, unpublished dissertations, and non-peer-reviewed studies were excluded. This review comprises 24 of 27,322 identified studies; 23 included studies focused on provitamin A carotenoids. There were 17,214 participants across the 24 studies with sample sizes ranging from 8 to 3571 individuals. Intervention studies spanned from 3 wk to 2 y. Fifteen (63%) studies were randomized control trials, 7 were cross-sectional, and 2 were longitudinal studies. Most studies (N = 21) used biochemical measurements, for example, serum retinol, to assess vitamin A status; other studies used clinical symptoms (for example, xerophtalmia) or dietary intake. Thirteen (54%) studies reported a statistically significant effect of food-based interventions (N = 8) or an association of diet (N = 5) on vitamin A status. This systematic review indicated that some food-based interventions improved vitamin A status, thus offering a safe and effective delivery mechanism for vitamin A. There appeared to be significant association between vitamin A status and consumption of foods with high concentrations of preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids. Differences across studies in regard to the period of evaluation, food approaches used, and statistical power may explain the lack of effectiveness of food-based approaches on vitamin A status in some studies.",

Diets included no added fat, 3% added choice white grease, or 3% added soy oil with either a supplemented vitamin A (for a total of 11,640 IU vitamin A/kg, Rovimix A 1000, DSM, Parsippany, NJ, US) or beta-carotene (for a total of 8,708 IU vitamin A/kg equivalent, Rovimix β-Carotene 10%, DSM). Pigs were given a 3-d adaptation period upon arrival. Pigs were weighed at the start of the study and at the end of each phase. A blood sample was taken from one pig per pen at the start and end of the study. Tissues were collected from eight pigs at the start of the study and six pigs per treatment at the end of the study. Data were analyzed via the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS 9.4 (SAS Inst., Cary, NC). Pen was the experimental unit, and repeated measures were used for growth performance and blood parameters. There was no fat by supplement interaction (P > 0.05) on body weight (BW), but there was a tendency (P = 0.054) for heavier BWs when soy oil was added to diets. There was no difference (P > 0.05) in average daily feed intake or average daily gain (ADG). There was an improved gain:feed (P = 0.02) when pigs were fed choice white grease over no added fat. There were time differences (P < 0.05) for plasma vitamins A (retinol), D (25 hydroxy vitamin D3), and E (alpha-tocopherol). Vitamin A and D values were higher at the end of the study, whereas vitamin E values were lower at the end of the study. The choice white grease diets had the highest (P < 0.05) plasma vitamins D and E (6.74 ng/mL and 2.87 ppm, respectively). Pigs supplemented with vitamin A had higher (P < 0.05) hepatic vitamin A than pigs supplemented with beta-carotene (19.9 vs. 15.6 ppm, respectively). There were no differences (P < 0.05) between immunoglobulins G and M or mRNA abundance of select genes (retinol binding protein 2, alcohol dehydrogenase class 1, lecithin retinol acyltransferase phosphatidylcholine-retinol O-acyltransferase, and beta-carotene oxygenase 1). In conclusion, fat inclusion level and type, with either vitamin A or beta-carotene supplementation, did not affect the overall nursery pig growth performance. The addition of fat resulted in an increase in ADG and BW. Diets with choice white grease had the highest plasma vitamins D and E, and supplemental vitamin A increased hepatic vitamin A."

The present study investigated the effect of vitamin A (VA) on the development of rabbit dermal papilla cells (DPCs) under HS and the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Addition of 0.4 mg/L VA to the culture medium significantly enhanced cell proliferation (P < 0.001) and inhibited the apoptosis of DPCs (P < 0.01). VA decreased the proportion of DPCs in G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle under HS along with the expression of caspase 3, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and microRNA 195 (miR-195) (P < 0.05). VA also activated the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and Wnt10b/β-catenin signaling pathways. The results of the dual luciferase reporter assay showed that IGF1 expression was modulated by miR-195-5p. Over-expression of miR-195-5p in DPCs with HS+VA treatment significantly reduced cell viability and IGF1 signaling (P < 0.01) and increased apoptosis (P < 0.01) compared with the HS+VA group. The positive effects of VA on proliferation and apoptosis of DPCs under HS were significantly attenu-ated by blocking Wnt10b and β-catenin signaling with IWP-2 and XAV-939, respectively. These results demonstrate that VA can promote hair follicle development following HS via modulation of miR-195/IGF1 and Wnt10b/β-catenin signaling pathways."

Although vitamin A deficiency (VAD) presents as a common cause of preventable blindness in areas with poor access to foods rich in vitamin A, it is uncommon in developed countries. We present a 56-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease and pancreatitis who was referred to our ophthalmology office by optometry for severe dry eyes. He complained of a two-year history of constant blurred vision and nyctalopia. He stated that \"images just appear dark.\" Examination demonstrated mildly decreased visual acuity with severe ocular surface disease and characteristic Bitot's spots in both eyes. Based on the patient's history and physical, a diagnosis of xerophthalmia in the setting of VAD was made. The patient was referred to his internist, he then underwent further evaluation and treatment with vitamin A intramuscular injections post-diagnosis.  This case illustrates the potential for VAD secondary to malabsorption from Crohn's disease and the importance of taking a full patient history so systemic causes of ophthalmic symptoms may be promptly identified and treated. VAD is extremely rare in the United States, however, patients at risk for VAD may benefit from regular vitamin A level checks and ophthalmologic evaluation."

      "abstract": "Breastfed Malawian infants from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-uninfected and HIV-infected women who received antiretroviral therapy were followed until 12 months of age, allowing us to evaluate plasma levels of ferritin, vitamin A (as retinol-binding protein, RBP), and vitamin D (25(OH)D) at six months, as well as nutritional status and growth between six and 12 months. Ferritin and RBP levels were adjusted for inflammation. The study included 88 infants, 63 of whom were part of a recent cohort (2019-2021) that included 49 HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) and 14 HIV-unexposed and uninfected (HUU) infants, as well as 25 infants (all HEU) from an earlier cohort (2008-2011). No differences were observed between HEU and HUU infants regarding micronutrient levels, anthropometric indexes, growth, and rates of stunting, being underweight, or wasting. HEU infants from the earlier cohort, when compared to more recent HEU infants, had significantly worse anthropometric measures at six months and inferior growth between six and twelve months. Overall, ferritin deficiency involved 68.6% of infants, while vitamin A and vitamin D deficiency involved 8% and 1.2% of infants, respectively. Micronutrient deficiencies were not associated with HIV exposure, cohort, stunting, being underweight, or wasting. At six months, stunting, being underweight, and wasting involved 25.0%, 2.7% and 2.8% of infants, respectively, with no differences related to HIV exposure. Ferritin deficiency at six months was associated with inferior subsequent growth. In this small observational study conducted in Malawian infants, no major nutritional gap was observed between HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants, though the study highlighted specific nutritional deficiencies that deserve attention. High rates of stunting and ferritin deficiency were observed in the first year of life in Malawian infants, irrespective of maternal HIV status; a significant association between ferritin deficiency and worse subsequent growth was found. Vitamin A and vitamin D deficiencies were much less frequent. Based on the data observed, nutritional interventions should give priority to the correction of ferritin deficiency and chronic undernutrition.",

      "abstract": "Background: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a common neurosensory manifestation in long COVID. An effective and safe treatment against COVID-19-related OD is needed. Methods: This pilot trial recruited long COVID patients with persistent OD. Participants were randomly assigned to receive short-course (14 days) oral vitamin A (VitA; 25,000 IU per day) and aerosolised diffuser olfactory training (OT) thrice daily (combination), OT alone (standard care), or observation (control) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was differences in olfactory function by butanol threshold tests (BTT) between baseline and end-of-treatment. Secondary outcomes included smell identification tests (SIT), structural MRI brain, and serial seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analyses in the olfactory cortical network by resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Results: A total of 24 participants were randomly assigned to receive either combination treatment (n = 10), standard care (n = 9), or control (n = 5). Median OD duration was 157 days (IQR 127-175). Mean baseline BTT score was 2.3 (SD 1.1). At end-of-treatment, mean BTT scores were significantly higher for the combination group than control (p < 0.001, MD = 4.4, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.2) and standard care (p = 0.009) groups. Interval SIT scores increased significantly (p = 0.009) in the combination group. rs-fMRI showed significantly higher FC in the combination group when compared to other groups. At end-of-treatment, positive correlations were found in the increased FC at left inferior frontal gyrus and clinically significant improvements in measured BTT (r = 0.858, p < 0.001) and SIT (r = 0.548, p = 0.042) scores for the combination group. Conclusions: Short-course oral VitA and aerosolised diffuser OT was effective as a combination treatment for persistent OD in long COVID."

      "abstract": "The persistent transformation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into myofibroblasts (MFs) and the excessive proliferation of MF-HSCs in the liver contribute to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Glycolysis inhibition of MF-HSCs can reverse their MF phenotype and suppress their abnormal expansion. Here, we have developed vitamin A-derivative (VA) decorated PEG-PCL polymeric micelles to encapsulate the labile and hydrophobic camptothecin (CPT) and direct its active attack on HSCs, selectively inhibiting of HIF-1α and cellular glycolysis, ultimately repressing hepatic fibrogenesis. The obtained micelles exhibited a good stability, biocompatibility, pH sensitivity, and exceptional HSC-targetability, allowing an efficient accumulation of their carried CPT in acutely and chronically injured livers. On their intracellular release of CPT specifically in MF-HSCs, these CPT micelles nicely inhibited the HIF-1α and a series of glycolytic players in MF-HSCs and prominently suppressed their proliferation and MF phenotypic characteristics. Accordingly, on in vitro administration to the mice challenged by CCl4 or subjected to bile duct ligation, these VA-decorated CPT micelles ameliorated the pathological symptoms of the livers, as evidenced by the significant reduction in serum levels of ALT and AST, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and collagen accumulation, the drastic down-regulation of multiple fibrotic genes, and the good recovery of attenuated hepatocyte CYP2E1 and lipogenesis regulator PPARγ. Overall, the CPT carried by VA-decorated PEG-PCL polymeric micelles can selectively inhibit the glycolysis and expansion of HSCs and thus suppress fibrogenesis, providing an original and effective approach for anti-fibrotic therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Our work introduces an innovative antifibrotic drug system that is developed upon the active targeting of CPT and aims for the fate reversal of HSCs. Through HSC-targeted delivery achieved by PEG-PCL polymeric micelles decorated with vitamin A-derivatives, CPT significantly suppressed the expressions of HIF-1α and glycolytic enzymes in MF-HSCs, as well as their pathologic expansion in mouse livers. It effectively ameliorated chronic liver fibrosis in mice induced by CCl4 injection or BDL and restored the damaged liver structure and function. These compelling findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of glycolytic HSC-targeting in combating fibrosis and related disorders and thus provide new promise for future clinical management of such prevalent and life-threatening conditions.",

A 6-year-old boy complained of difficulty in opening the eyelids. The ocular conjunctiva was hyperemic and keratinized with purulent ocular (eye) discharge. Both corneas showed epithelial defects with hypopyon. The serum vitamin A level was ≤5 IU/dL (normal 97-316), leading to a diagnosis of xerophthalmia and keratomalacia due to vitamin A deficiency. Intramuscular injection of vitamin A (50,000 IU/day), as well as oral administration of multivitamin (containing 2,500 IU of vitamin A) and zinc supplement at 50 mg/day, allowed him to open both eyes and show interest in tablet devices 14 days after the diagnosis. During the course of the treatment, corneal perforation was observed, but it was closed without contact lens wear or amniotic patch and managed with vitamin A replacement therapy and antimicrobial eye drops. The epithelium extended to the area of the right cornea that had been melted, and although scarring corneal opacity remained, there were no obvious signs of infection. Early diagnosis is difficult because children with ASD do not express complaints, and vitamin A deficiency should be considered in patients with a severely unbalanced diet and complaints of difficulty opening the eyelids."

      "abstract": "Vitamin A and its metabolite, retinoic acid (RA) play important roles in regulating skeletal muscle development. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of early intramuscular vitamin A injection on the muscle growth of lambs. A total of 16 newborn lambs were given weekly intramuscular injections of corn oil (control group, n = 8) or 7,500 IU vitamin A palmitate (vitamin A group, n = 8) from birth to 3 wk of age (4 shots in total). At 3 wk of age and weaning, biceps femoris muscle samples were taken to analyze the effects of vitamin A on the myogenic capacity of skeletal muscle cells. All lambs were slaughtered at 8 months of age. The results suggest that vitamin A treatment accelerated the growth rate of lambs and increased the loin eye area (P < 0.05). Consistently, vitamin A increased the diameter of myofibers in longissimus thoracis muscle (P < 0.01) and increased the final body weight of lambs (P < 0.05). Vitamin A injection did not change the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin and myostatin signaling (P > 0.05). Moreover, vitamin A upregulated the expression of PAX7 (P < 0.05) and the myogenic marker genes including MYOD and MYOG (P < 0.01). The skeletal muscle-derived mononuclear cells from vitamin A-treated lambs showed higher expression of myogenic genes (P < 0.05) and formed more myotubes (P < 0.01) when myogenic differentiation was induced in vitro. In addition, in vitro analysis showed that RA promoted myogenic differentiation of the skeletal muscle-derived mononuclear cells in the first 3 d (P < 0.05) but not at the later stage (P > 0.05) as evidenced by myogenic gene expression and fusion index. Taken together, neonatal intramuscular vitamin A injection promotes lamb muscle growth by promoting the myogenic potential of satellite cells."

      "abstract": "Dietary deficiencies in zinc (Zn) and vitamin A (VA) are among the leading micronutrient deficiencies globally and previous research has proposed a notable interaction between Zn and VA physiological status. This study aimed to assess the effects of zinc and vitamin A (isolated and combined) on intestinal functionality and morphology, and the gut microbiome (Gallus gallus). The study included nine treatment groups (n~11)-no-injection (NI); H2O; 0.5% oil; normal zinc (40 mg/kg ZnSO4) (ZN); low zinc (20 mg/kg) (ZL); normal retinoid (1500 IU/kg retinyl palmitate) (RN); low retinoid (100 IU/kg) (RL); normal zinc and retinoid (40 mg/kg; 1500 IU/kg) (ZNRN); low zinc and retinoid (ZLRL) (20 mg/kg; 100 IU/kg). Samples were injected into the amniotic fluid of the fertile broiler eggs. Tissue samples were collected upon hatch to target biomarkers. ZLRL reduced ZIP4 gene expression and upregulated ZnT1 gene expression (p < 0.05). Duodenal surface area increased the greatest in RL compared to RN (p < 0.01), and ZLRL compared to ZNRN (p < 0.05). All nutrient treatments yielded shorter crypt depths (p < 0.01). Compared to the oil control, ZLRL and ZNRN reduced (p < 0.05) the cecal abundance of Bifidobacterium and Clostridium genera (p < 0.05). These results suggest a potentially improved intestinal epithelium proceeding with Zn and VA intra-amniotic administration. Intestinal functionality and gut bacteria were modulated. Further research should characterize long-term responses and the microbiome profile.",

      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis (LF) is one of the major diseases that threaten human health. Until now, no effective drugs have been approved for clinical anti-liver fibrosis treatment. In this study, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) lipid nanoparticles loaded with pirfenidone (PFD) and modified with vitamin A (VA) were constructed (VA-PFD@ZIF-8@DMPC NPs). PFD was embedded in ZIF-8 by the \"one-pot\" method, and the prepared ZIF-8 had a small particle size (84.3 nm) and high drug loading (54.46%). Moreover, the inherent pH sensitivity of ZIF-8 makes it stable in a normal physiological environment and collapsed in an acidic environment, thus controlling drug release and preventing drug leakage. Besides, the phospholipid layer makes the nano-drug delivery system dispersible and improves its biocompatibility. More importantly, VA is modified on the surface of nanoparticles (NPs), which can target the highly expressed retinol-binding protein receptor (RBPR) on the surface of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), thereby accurately increasing the local drug concentration at the site of LF. In vivo experiments showed that VA-PFD@ZIF-8@DMPC NPs can reduce liver injury, improve the degree of LF, and exert specific therapeutic effects on LF. In conclusion, this nano-delivery system may become a novel and effective anti-liver fibrosis treatment.",

      "abstract": "The small intestine serves as the first channel of dietary Vitamin A (VA) and the unique organ of VA absorption and metabolism. However, there have not been extensive investigations on the exact mechanisms within VA-related changes in intestinal metabolic disorders. This research is designed to analyze whether and how VA affects intestinal metabolic phenotypes. Male C57BL/6 mice after weaning were randomly fed a VA control diet (VAC) or a VA-deficient diet (VAD) during the entire pregnancy and lactation process. After a total of 11 weeks, cohorts of VA deprived were next fed to a VA control diet (VAD-C) for another 8 weeks. The concentration of retinol was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography system. The 16S gene sequencing was used to evaluate the intestinal microbiota changes. Through the use of histological staining, western blots, quantitative PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the intestinal morphology, inflammatory factors, and intestinal permeability were all evaluated. Following the decrease of the tissue VA levels, VAD mice show a decrease in tissue VA levels, community differences, and the richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota. VAD diet-driven changes occur in intestinal microbiota, accompanied by a higher mRNA expression of intestinal inflammatory cytokines and an increase in intestinal permeability. As dietary VA is reintroduced into VAD diet-fed mice, the tissue VA levels, inflammatory response, and intestinal homeostasis profiles are all restored, which are similar to those found after the occurrence of VA-controlled changes within intestinal microbiota. VA deficiency caused the imbalance of intestinal metabolic phenotypes through a mechanism involving changes in intestinal microbiota. It is thought that intestinal microbiota metabolic influences represent a new salient and additional mechanism, which can be used as a new method to achieve the onset and treatment of the effect of VAD on intestinal homeostasis impairment."

For this experiment, 54 rabbits were randomized into six experimental and three control groups. Mixed cultures of commercial probiotics supplements and a dose of Vit A were administered to each animal. Results were compared with the control group fed with only basal diet. Animals in different treatment groups showed significantly higher sero-conversions against rabies vaccine. There was a significant increase (p < 0.001) in the titers of rabies antibodies in all treatment groups on 14th and 35th days than control C3 group. Both commercial probiotics irrespective of brand increase the humoral immune response of rabbits against rabies vaccine. The mean titer values of all groups G1-G6 and sub-controls (C1, C2) were generally above 3.6 EU/ml on day 14th and between 3.7 and 3.9 EU/ml, showing highest sero-conversion on 35th day than mean titer of C3 control = 3.091 and 3.505 EU/ml respectively on both days. The maximum titer values were obtained with the addition of organic carrots to the daily diet. These results suggest that simple dietary interventions using probiotics and Vit A in natural form may enhance the efficacy of rabies vaccine in the host. These cost-effective strategies can be applied for getting higher yields of polyclonal antibody production in animal models, thus providing promising means of improving the final product yield and can be adopted easily by the manufacturers."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Dopamine-related movement disorders are associated with a loss of visual acuity. Studies have shown that chemical stimulation of the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) ameliorates movement disorders; however, the chemical stimulation is not effective when there is a deficiency of vitamin A in the cells. In the study, we examine the role of VDR and its interplay with vitamin A in impaired visual function in the dopamine deficit model. METHODS: Thirty (30) male mice with an average weight of 26 g ± (2) were divided into six group (NS,-D2,-D2 + VD D2 + VD, -D2 + VA, -D2 + (VD + VA) and -D2 + D2 groups). Dopamine deficit models of movement disorders were created using 15 mg/kg of haloperidol (-D2) injected intraperitoneally daily for 21 days. In the -D2 + (VD + VA) group, 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 (VD) and 1000 IU/day of vitamin A were concurrently used, while in the -D2 + D2 group, bromocriptine (+D2) was used as the standard treatment of the model. At the end of the treatment phase, the animals were subjected to visual water box test for visual acuity. The level of oxidative stress was measured using Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the retina and visual cortex. The level of cytotoxicity in these tissues was measured using Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, while the structural integrity of these tissues was assessed using a light microscope by assessing slide mounted sections that were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. RESULTS: A significant decline in time taken to reach the escape platform in the visual water box test was observed in the -D2 (p<0.005) and -D2 + D2 (p<0.05) group. In the retina and the visual cortex, a significant increase in LDH, MDA and the density of degenerating neurons was observed in the -D2 and -D2 + D2 groups. LDH level in the retina was also found to be significantly increased in (-D2 + VD, -D2 + VA, -D2 + (VD + VA). A Significant decrease in SOD was found in the retina and visual cortex of -D2 and -D2 + D2 group. In the histology of the retina, thinning of the retina, retinal fold, distortion and retinal detachment were all seen in the -D2 group. These structural alterations were not seen in other groups. Histological hallmarks of degeneration were observed in the visual cortex of the mice from the -D2 (p<0.001), -D2 + D2 (p<0.005) and -D2 + VD (p<0.05) groups only. CONCLUSIONS: Dopamine-deficient models of movement disorders are associated with loss of visual functions, especially due to thinning of the retina, retinal fold, retinal detachment, and neurodegeneration in the visual cortex. Supplementation during the development of the model with vitamin D3 and vitamin A prevented the deterioration of the retina and visual cortex by reducing the degree of oxidative stress and cytotoxicity.",

There are inconsistent findings that can affect policy in planning appropriate intervention. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to summarize the evidence in order to identify existing gaps and propose strategies to reduce VAD during pregnancy in Ethiopia. METHODS: This study included published and unpublished observational studies searched from different databases (PubMed, CINHAL [EBSCO], Embase, Google Scholar, Directory of Open Access Journals, Web of Sciences, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Search and MedNar). Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata version 14 software. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. Forest plots were used to present the pooled prevalence using the random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 37 618 pregnant women from 15 studies were included. The overall pooled prevalence of VAD was 29% (95% confidence interval 21 to 36) with I2=99.67% and p<0.001. Socio-economic and sociodemographic factors were identified as affecting vitamin A deficiencies among pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-third of pregnant women in Ethiopia had VAD. Strengthening intervention modalities that aimed to increase the uptake of vitamin A-rich foods can avert VAD among pregnant women in Ethiopia.",

      "abstract": "Mucormycosis is a rare but serious opportunistic fungal disease characterized by rhino-orbito-cerebral and pulmonary involvement. It is mainly seen in people with secondary immunosuppression, isolated vitamin A deficiency, measles, and AIDS patients. It showed a rise during the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the spring of 2021 in India, especially in diabetic COVID-19 patients. Vitamin A deficiency is known to cause nutritional immunodeficiency and hence leading the way to increased opportunistic fungal, bacterial, and viral infections. In the eye, it causes keratitis, night blindness, xerophthalmia, conjunctivitis, Bitot spots, keratomalacia, and retinopathy. It also causes decreased tear secretion and deterioration of the anatomical/physiological defense barrier of the eye. The negative impact of vitamin A deficiency has been previously demonstrated in measles, AIDS, and COVID-19. We think that mucormycosis in COVID-19 might be rendered by vitamin A deficiency and that vitamin A supplementation may have preventive and therapeutic values against mucormycosis and other ocular symptoms associated with COVID-19. However, any vitamin A treatment regimen needs to be based on laboratory and clinical data and supervised by medical professionals.",

      "abstract": "Norovirus (NoV) is the most common viral cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Vitamin A has demonstrated the potential to protect against gastrointestinal infections. However, the effects of vitamin A on human norovirus (HuNoV) infections remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate how vitamin A administration affects NoV replication. We demonstrated that treatment with retinol or retinoic acid (RA) inhibited NoV replication in vitro based on their effects on HuNoV replicon-bearing cells and murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1) replication in murine cells. MNV replication in vitro showed significant transcriptomic changes, which were partially reversed by retinol treatment. RNAi knockdown of CCL6, a chemokine gene that was downregulated by MNV infection but upregulated by retinol administration, resulted in increased MNV replication in vitro. This suggested a role of CCL6 in the host response to MNV infections. Similar gene expression patterns were observed in the murine intestine after oral administration of RA and/or MNV-1.CW1. CCL6 directly decreased HuNoV replication in HG23 cells, and might indirectly regulate the immune response against NoV infection. Finally, relative replication levels of MNV-1.CW1 and MNV-1.CR6 were significantly increased in CCL6 knockout RAW 264.7 cells. This study is the first to comprehensively profile transcriptomes in response to NoV infection and vitamin A treatment in vitro, and thus may provide new insights into dietary prophylaxis and NoV infections.",

OBJECTIVES: This analysis aimed to determine the impact of supplementing children's diets with 1 egg/d on the concentration of plasma retinol and RBP and the prevalence of VAD. METHODS: Children age 6-9 mo living in the Mangochi district of Malawi were individually randomly assigned to receive 1 egg/d for 6 mo (n = 331) or continue their usual diet (n = 329) in the Mazira trial (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT03385252). This secondary analysis measured plasma retinol by HPLC and RBP, CRP, and α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) by ELISA techniques at enrollment and 6 mo follow-up. Retinol and RBP were adjusted for inflammation, and mean concentrations were compared between groups using linear regression models. In addition, prevalence ratios of VAD (retinol <0.7 μmol/L) were compared between groups using log-binomial or modified Poisson regression models. RESULTS: After 6 mo of study participation, 489 were assessed for retinol (egg: n = 238; control: n = 251), and 575 (egg: n = 281; control: n = 294) were assessed for RBP. Prevalence of inflammation (CRP >5 mg/L or AGP >1 g/L: 62%) and inflammation-adjusted VAD (7%) at enrollment did not differ between groups. At follow-up, the egg intervention group did not differ from the control in inflammation-adjusted retinol [geometric mean (95% CI); egg: 1.10 μmol/L (1.07, 1.13); control: 1.08 (1.05, 1.12)], RBP [egg: 0.99 μmol/L (0.96, 1.02); control: 0.97 (0.94, 1.00)], or prevalence of VAD [egg: 6%; control: 3%; prevalence ratio: 1.87 (0.83, 4.24)]. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of 1 egg/d did not impact VAD, plasma retinol, or RBP among young children in rural Malawi, where the prevalence of VAD was low.

      "abstract": "Vitamin-A deficiency associated with night blindness in children is a global health problem that could be prevented or reduced by promoting the intake of β-carotene in food. The fortification of β-carotene in yogurt using pumpkin flesh (PF) could be a very cost-effective public health intervention. The current study aimed to analyze the proximate, functional, microbial, textural, and sensory properties of yogurt fortified with PF to evaluate its suitability as a β-carotene enriched food. The research was conducted with three treatments, control set-type yogurt (CSY) with no PF, 15% PF-fortified set-type yogurt (15PFSY), and 20% PF-fortified set-type yogurts (20PFSY) followed by pumpkin pie spice and ground pumpkin seed to improve consumer acceptability. The fortified yogurt with 20PFSY and 15PFSY contained a higher amount of β-carotene, protein, fiber, and ash, and lower carbohydrate, fat, and energy in compression with CSY, which might attract health-conscious people. In addition, viable bacterial count, firmness, consistency, cohesiveness, and viscosity index were found better in fortified yogurt. Based on reports of sensory panellists, 15PFSY achieved a significantly (p < 0.01) highest overall acceptability than 20PFSY and CSY. These findings suggest that pumpkin-fortified yogurt could be used widely as a nutrient-enriched fermented food. In addition, as a β-carotene (vitamin-A) fortified yogurt, it could be a potential alternative to prevent or reduce blindness in children with minimal cost."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malnutrition due to inadequate dietary intake is commonly reported in children with Cerebral palsy (CP). Poor dietary intakes are majorly caused by feeding dysfunctions secondary to oro-motor impairment characteristic of the condition. Strategies that improve nutrient densities in foods can help enhance nutrient intakes by these children. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of consumption of fermented finger millet porridge fortified with Moringa oleifera leaf powder (MoLP) on the protein and vitamin A status of children with CP. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 113 children aged 5-11 years with CP. The study had two arms (intervention [N = 57] and control [N = 56]). The intervention group received a daily serving of fortified finger millet porridge for 3 months while the control group received non-fortified finger millet porridge servings. All children received the same amounts of porridge servings. The levels of serum albumin and retinol between the groups were compared at both baseline and end line. The BMI-for-age Z-scores (BMIAZ) and morbidity prevalence of the children were also assessed. RESULTS: At baseline, the two study groups were similar in all demographic and socio-economic characteristics, nutrient intakes, serum levels of albumin and retinol, weight status and morbidity. At end line, the children from the intervention group had significantly higher intakes of vitamin A at 717.12±432.7 μg/d (p = 0.038) and protein at 44.367±17.2 g/d (p = 0.031) respectively. The serum nutrients levels increased significantly from baseline by 0.456±0.12 g/dL (p<0.001) for albumin and by 0.243±0.10 μmol/L (p<0.001) for retinol among children in the intervention group. Among the children in the control group, the changes in the levels of both serum albumin 0.012±0.07 g/dL (p = 0.868) and serum retinol [0.0021±0.02 μmol/L (p = 0.890)] were not significant. At endline, the BMI-for-age Z-scores results showed that 10.52% and 34.0% of children from intervention and control group respectively were undernourished [χ2 = 30.985; p = 0.037]. Among the children in the intervention, group there was a significant change in the weight status between baseline and endline (p = 0.036). The weight status among children in the control group was not significantly different between baseline and endline (p = 0.109). Significant difference in morbidity prevalence between the two groups was also observed at endline (p = 0.003) with the prevalence being 24.6% and 51.8% among children in the intervention and control group respectively. CONCLUSION: Consumption of M. oleifera fortified porridge significantly improved the children's serum albumin and retinol levels, as well as BMIAZ.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A recent approach to cure neurodegenerative diseases is to reprogram fibroblasts into functioning neurons using multiple exogenous transcription factors (TFs) and micro-RNAs. Administering agents that can endogenously induce these TFs may bypass the limitations of this approach. Astrocytes may represent a part of the extrahepatic-stellate system involved in vitamin-A (VA ) homeostasis. Activated-stellate cells lose their VA -storage capacity, and this was previously applied for hepatic-stellate cells (HSCs) targeting to treat liver fibrosis. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that Parkinson's disease (PD) may be coupled with retinoid depletion that may extract VA from VA -rich-HSCs triggering liver fibrosis. Thus, VA administration may selectively target VA -deficient reactive astrocytes and HSCs. Besides, VA has the regenerative capability and may induce endogenous-TFs generation. METHODS: Fluorescently labeled VA -coupled liposomes (FLV) were traced using confocal laser microscope in rats with induced PD for detecting brain accumulation and uptake into fluorescently labeled astrocytes. Liver fibrosis associated with PD was assessed biochemically and histopathologically, while VA deficiency was confirmed by assessing retinol-binding protein gene expression in the brain and liver. Multiple VA doses were tested for reversing PD-associated liver fibrosis, generating TFs (involved in reprograming astrocytes/fibroblasts into different neuronal types) and capability of dopaminergic-neurons regeneration. RESULTS: Fluorescently labeled VA -coupled liposomes revealed selective brain accumulation and uptake into astrocytes. PD was associated with significant liver fibrosis and VA deficiency in the brain and liver. Furthermore, VA -medium dose (VAMD) was the optimum one for reversing PD-associated liver fibrosis, generating multiple astrocytes/fibroblasts reprogramming TFs, regenerating dopaminergic neurons, and improving PD. CONCLUSION: VA -medium dose pursued brain targeting in PD with the potential capability of regenerating neurons and restoring dopaminergic transmission. This may place this therapy as an essential treatment in PD management protocol.",
