      "abstract": "Creation of a biological seal and efficient antibacterial qualities in the peri-implant environment is essential for the success of dental implants. Therefore, novel multifunctional strategies are being developed to address these issues, aiming at the simultaneous improvement of tissue integration and hindering pathological biofilm formation. In this study, we investigated the effect of tissue-promotive strontium acetate (SrAc), antibacterial silver nitrate (AgNO3), and their combination on oral soft tissue cells and an oral multispecies biofilm not only in monoculture setups but also in a three-dimensional (3D) implant-tissue-oral bacterial-biofilm model (INTERbACT model) that takes the naturally occurring interactions into account. Application of SrAc led to improved fibroblast migration in the monoculture setting, without impairment of metabolic activity, even upon additional AgNO3 administration. Notably, the combined treatment of SrAc and AgNO3 resulted in a synergistic antibacterial effect during biofilm formation as well as on early matured biofilms. Most interestingly, the antibacterial effect of the combined treatment was even further enhanced within the coculture setup leading to increased bacterial death and decreased biofilm volume. The 3D tissue in the coculture setup underwent the combined treatment with a notable rise in CCL20 and IL-1β levels. Histologically, only the AgNO3-treated groups exhibited damage to the integrity of the epithelial barrier. Therefore, the results of this study demonstrated promising dual antibacterial and tissue-integrative characteristics of combined AgNO3 and SrAc in the dental implant environment. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of considering naturally occurring tissue-bacteria interactions for reliable in vitro testing of novel implant materials."

This study aims to evaluate its potential for enhancing diabetic wound repair through combined ionic crosslinking and bioactive component synergy. The hydrogel demonstrates exceptional swelling properties conducive to the absorption of wound exudate. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable antibacterial and antioxidant activities. The ASASG hydrogel shows good biocompatibility, facilitates hemostasis and promotes the migration of NIH 3 T3 fibroblasts. Animal studies have revealed that ASASG hydrogel significantly enhances wound healing, accelerates re-epithelialization, and fosters collagen deposition in diabetic rats. Furthermore, ASASG hydrogels mitigated inflammatory cell infiltration by down-regulating IL-6 expression and concurrently up-regulating TGF-β expression. Notably, ASASG hydrogels also stimulate angiogenesis by enhancing the expressions of VEGF and bFGF. Therefore, the use of ASASG hydrogel in the treatment of diabetic wounds is a possible therapeutic approach."

      "abstract": "The development of multifunctional nanomaterials for environmental remediation and energy storage is critical for sustainable technologies. In this study, we synthesized strontium-doped titanium dioxide (Sr-TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) via a green method and investigated their structural, optical, and electrochemical properties to enhance photocatalytic and supercapacitive performance. Characterization results confirmed successful Sr incorporation into the TiO2 lattice. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed a slight shift in peak positions, indicating lattice distortion due to Sr doping. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed uniform, well-dispersed nanoparticles, while energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra confirmed elemental composition. UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) demonstrated a redshift in absorption, reducing the bandgap and enhancing visible-light absorption. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy identified characteristic functional groups, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis indicated increased surface area, favoring photocatalytic and electrochemical activity. The photocatalytic performance of Sr-TiO2 NPs was assessed through Methylene Orange (MO) and Congo Red (Con-R) degradation under visible light at different pH levels. Under optimized conditions, Sr-TiO2 NPs achieved 94.48% MO removal in 100 min and 97.89% Con-R removal in 70 min, following pseudo-first-order kinetics, demonstrating their efficiency as visible-light-driven photocatalysts for wastewater treatment. Electrochemical studies, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), revealed improved charge storage and lower charge transfer resistance compared to bare TiO2. The Sr-TiO2 NPs exhibited enhanced specific capacitance and good electrochemical stability, underscoring their potential as high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors. These findings highlight a sustainable approach to environmental remediation and energy storage by leveraging Sr-doped TiO2 nanomaterials for dual-functional applications."

      "abstract": "Hydrogen incorporation into metal oxides enhances their electrochemical properties, making them highly suitable for various energy conversion applications. The controlled distribution of hydrogen ions in material systems and their conduction at elevated temperatures have garnered significant attention for various energy storage and environmental monitoring applications, including fuel cells, smart windows, and sensor technologies. In this work, cost-effective, high-concentration hydrogen-doped SrFeO3-δ (HSrFeO3-δ) films were prepared under ambient conditions by treating Al(s)|SrFeO3-δ(s) films with KOH(aq), utilizing electron-proton codoping to investigate hydrogen distribution. The uphill hydrogen distributions in SrFeO3-δ films with compressive strain, in contrast to the density gradient behavior under tensile strain, suggest the fundamental role of the strain states in the hydrogen accommodation. Compressively strained films with a rich Al source follow an anomalous uphill feature of hydrogen distribution, highlighting their potential use as electrolyte for fuel cells. The strain significantly influences the structure, chemical lattice coupling, and consequently the ionic transport in SrFeO3-δ. Ionic conductivity measurements reveal that compressively strained HSrFeO3-δ films with uphill hydrogen distributions exhibit a significant ionic conductivity of 0.189 S/cm at 413 K, with an activation energy of approximately 0.29 eV, making them suitable for low-temperature electrochemical applications. These findings provide a promising approach for tuning material properties and valuable insights for building iontronic devices."

This prospective, open-label, real-world study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of strontium cream in alleviating pruritus in HS. METHODS: Fifty participants completed baseline and one-week post-intervention surveys. Pruritus was assessed using a numeric severity scale and a qualitative survey on overall itch reduction. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed a significant reduction in itching symptoms post-intervention, with mean itch scores decreasing from 3.80±0.90 at baseline to 2.28±1.50 post-intervention (p<0.001). Participant feedback also indicated overall satisfaction, with 84 percent of participants willing to recommend the cream to other HS patients. LIMITATIONS: The study relied on self-reported data, which introduces subjectivity, and the absence of a control group limits causal inference. CONCLUSION: Strontium cream demonstrates promise as a therapeutic option for managing pruritus in HS, warranting further research."

      "abstract": "To overcome problems associated with surgical site infection and implant loosening, we developed a titanium (Ti)-based material employing a modified alkaline heat treatment that releases strontium (Sr) and silver (Ag) ions (CaSrAg-Ti). In this study, to determine the optimal Ag treatment concentration, we prepared four different materials-commercially pure Ti (cp-Ti) as a negative control, CaSr1mMAg-Ti, CaSr10mMAg-Ti, and CaSr50mMAg-Ti. Ion release test was performed by immersing the prepared disks in fetal bovine serum. With increased loading of Ag ions, the amount of released ions increased. Colony-forming unit count assay was performed using methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. High antibacterial activity was observed in CaSr10mMAg-Ti and CaSr50mMAg-Ti groups. In vivo experiments were performed using the rat subcutaneous pocket infection model and evaluated by counting the attached bacteria, wound appearance, and histological evaluation. High antibacterial activity value (AAV >2) and anti-inflammatory effects were observed in the CaSr50mMAg-Ti group. However, CaSr10mMAg-Ti did not exhibit consistent antibacterial activity. For in vivo biocompatibility and bone-bonding ability evaluation, rods were implanted into the rat femur. No cytotoxicity was observed at 1 week, and good bone-bonding ability at 4 and 8 weeks was not significantly different from that of CaSr1mMAg-Ti. To evaluate in vivo bioactivity and cytotoxicity, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured on disks. CaSr10mMAg-Ti and CaSr50mMAg-Ti significantly inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3E1 cells, as well as the production of extracellular matrix in vivo, despite showing good biocompatibility in vivo. In conclusion, CaSr50mMAg-Ti, with increased Ag ion loading, exhibited high antibacterial activity in vivo while maintaining the bone-bonding ability and is a promising therapeutic biomaterial. Further research is needed to determine the optimal combination of therapeutic concentrations of Sr and Ag."

A novel adsorbent material (OSA@CF/Zr) for ultra-fast recovery of Sr2+ was obtained by grafting oxidized sodium alginate on zirconium cross-linked collagen fibers. The OSA@CF/Zr demonstrated rapid adsorption of Sr²⁺, achieving a maximum capacity of 0.415 mmol g-¹ within 6 min. Even after 17 recycling cycles, it retained an adsorption capacity of approximately 0.26 mmol g-¹ , highlighting its superior reusability. The OSA@CF/Zr could be applied at pH of 4-10, were hardly affected by co-existing K+, Na+, and Cs+ ions, and the effects of Mg2+ and Ca2+ were easily masked by CDTA, exhibiting high selectivity for Sr2+. The OSA@CF/Zr was well suited for continuous column adsorption operation, and the amount of treated wastewater and the removal rate was almost independent of the flow rate. The adsorption column, containing 1 g of OSA@CF/Zr, successfully removed over 95 % of Sr2+ from 1.737 L of simulated surface water with an initial Sr2+ concentration of 7.886 mg L-1. OSA@CF/Zr is a very promising material for strontium recovery."

To tackle this issue, researchers have developed strontium-containing biomaterials. However, preventing bacterial infection is also crucial for successful surgical treatment. In this study, we delved deep into the processing to tailor the composition and structure of new strontium silicates with unique properties to address this challenge. We used chemical precipitation to prepare various strontium silicate particles using varying ammonia concentrations and Sr/Si precursor ratios. The L929 cytotoxicity, differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), biological function of RAW 264.7 macrophages, and antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus were evaluated. As a result, higher ammonia concentration led to the formation of SrSiO3 and Sr2SiO4 particles with smaller sizes and higher Sr/Si ratios. These particles exhibited increased antibacterial efficacy and radiopacity, promoting cell viability and osteogenic activity of hMSCs and modulating M1/M2 macrophage polarization. In conclusion, the developed strontium silicate demonstrated superior antibacterial activity, exceptional osteogenic properties, and clear visibility during procedures, making it a promising material for bone regeneration and osteoporosis treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dental caries is one of the most prevalent chronic infectious diseases, mainly due to acid production by bacteria in the plaque biofilm, leading to enamel demineralization, tooth defects and pulpitis. Most of the current treatments are invasive and do not combine restoration of dental tissues, resolution of tooth staining or prevention of dental caries. In this study, a polydopamine (PDA)-encapsulated strontium-doped zinc oxide composite (Sr-ZnO@PDA, denoted as SZ@PDA) has been developed for caries prevention and remineralization. The PDA wrapping endows SZ@PDA with a narrow energy band gap (1.78 eV), which can simultaneously respond to yellow light (YL) with favorable biosafety and ultrasound (US) with high tissue penetration. The synergistic piezo-photocatalytic action of YL and US with the enhanced catalytic efficiency can generate an appropriate amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus destroying the structure of bacterial cellular membranes and decomposing pigments for caries prevention and improvement of tooth staining, respectively. In addition, strontium ions (Sr2+) released by SZ@PDA, as an active element, can promote the remineralization of enamel and dentin, repairing defective dental tissues. Collectively, this versatile system (SZ@PDA) provides an effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of caries."

This review systematically explored the biological mechanisms, application advancements, and associated challenges of magnesium, zinc, and strontium in fracture healing. Key topics included their roles in promoting osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, inhibiting osteoclast activity, and modulating the bone microenvironment. Additionally, this review examined the optimization strategies for their clinical application, such as their integration into bone scaffolds, the functionalization of conventional materials, and the synergistic effects between different metals. Finally, this review analyzed the current progress and unresolved issues in this field, offering a forward-looking perspective on the clinical potential of bioactive metallic materials in precision treatment of osteoporotic fractures."

      "abstract": "Progress has been made toward developing therapies to treat bone-related diseases and defects caused by trauma. However, some of these therapies, such as administering strontium ranelate to treat osteoporosis, have significant side effects. In this context, designing new and safer strontium-based materials constitutes an important current challenge. Here, we have used quercetin as a platform to synthesize a new complex based on strontium and evaluate its activity in vitro and in vivo. First, we carried out strontium complexation with quercetin. Then, we employed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and thermal gravimetric analysis to determine the chemical composition of the resulting complex as [(C15H7O7)Sr2]·6(H2O), which was also supported by theoretical calculations. This complex enhanced osteogenic differentiation of a preosteoblastic cell line in vitro, which increased alkaline phosphatase activity and extracellular matrix mineralization. By using a periapical lesion model in mice, we tested whether treatment with this complex could regenerate bone defects in vivo and found that the lesions decreased after 7 days. Together, our data showed that the strontium-quercetin complex synthesized herein is a potential candidate for developing new bone regeneration therapies."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Strontium (Sr2+) is a crucial trace element in humans, mainly present in the bones. We investigated the effects of Sr2+ on human periodontal ligament stem cell (hPDLSC) proliferation and osteogenesis and the relevant pathways. METHODS: hPDLSCs were harvested from extracted premolars and characterized by flow cytometry, then cultured and treated with various Sr2+ concentrations. Cell-counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays were used to assess hPDLSC proliferation, with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, Alizarin red S staining, and ALP activity assays used to analyze their osteogenic capacity. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blots were used to examine the expression levels of relevant factors, such as collagen I (COL-1), ALP, and Runx family transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). Moreover, tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 treatment was used to investigate the role of Sr2+ in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. RESULTS: The hPDLSCs were successfully isolated and cultured in vitro. A 0.01 mM Sr2+ concentration significantly enhanced hPDLSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. However, XAV939-mediated inhibition of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway could reverse the Sr2+-induced osteogenic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Sr2+ can enhance hPDLSC proliferation and osteogenesis by stimulating canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, suggesting it may play a critical role in periodontal regeneration and has clinical application potential.",

      "abstract": "Infected bone defects are a growing global health issue, with risks including bone destruction, disability, and even death. The main clinical challenge is the difficulty in simultaneously achieving effective antibacterial action and promoting bone regeneration. Calcination at 800°C induces a phase transition from cubic (C-BSTO) to polarized tetragonal (T-BSTO), imparting piezoelectric properties. Subsequent treatment with sodium borohydride generates oxygen vacancies, enhancing polarization and piezoelectric performance. The synthesized T-BSTO-Vo achieves 99.83% antibacterial efficiency against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) under 1.5 W cm² ultrasound (US) irradiation for 20 min. Mild US irradiation activates a piezoelectric signal, promoting Schwann cell (SC) neurogenic differentiation via PI3K-AKT signaling and intracellular Ca²⁺ elevation. Further studies showed that the synergy of the neurotransmitter of SCs and piezoelectric electric signal increased the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Consequently, US-irradiated T-BSTO-Vo effectively promotes the innervated bone regeneration in the MRSA-infected bone defect model through rapidly killing bacteria, modulating the immune microenvironment. This study offers a new approach for developing bioactive sonosensitizers through phase/defect engineering, and treats MRSA-infected bone defects through enhanced piezocatalytic effect and innervated bone regeneration."

      "abstract": "The management of open bone defects poses a formidable challenge in clinical practice, primarily due to issues such as profuse bleeding, inflammation, bacterial infections, and compromised bone fracture healing. To tackle these complexities, we have devised a novel hemostatic powder, namely the compound strontium-based chitosan quaternary ammonium salt hemostatic powder (QCS@SrT-TA). This innovative powder leverages the self-assembly of tripolyphosphate and strontium ions, facilitated by a positively charged core cross-linker. Furthermore, its surface has been strategically modified with polyphenol and positively charged macromolecules, imparting unique properties. The mesoporous architecture of QCS@SrT-TA facilitates rapid moisture absorption, enhancing its efficacy. In preclinical studies using rat tail artery amputation and liver bleeding models, QCS@SrT-TA exhibited remarkable performance, significantly reducing both bleeding time and volume (62.39 ± 2.89 mg, 35.33 ± 4.16 s in tail amputation, 63.7 ± 5.19 mg, 62.33 ± 9.61 s in liver bleeding). Notably, the positively charged strontium ions and quaternary ammonium salts within the powder were effective in removing bacteria, minimizing the risk of infection. Beyond hemostasis, QCS@SrT-TA demonstrates additional therapeutic benefits. It polarizes M2 macrophage phenotypes and promotes angiogenesis within bone defect sites, accelerating bone healing processes. Ultimately, a substantially enhanced and notable functional recovery is achieved. In summary, the rapid hemostatic, potent antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenesis-promoting characteristics of QCS@SrT-TA hold immense promise as a groundbreaking clinical treatment strategy for open bone defects.",

Emerging evidence underscores the therapeutic promise of exosomes in osteoarthritis management. Nonetheless, challenges such as low yields and insignificant efficacy of current exosome therapies necessitate significant advances. Addressing lower strontium (Sr) levels in arthritic synovial microenvironment, we studied the effect of Sr element on exosomes and miRNA selectively loading in synovial mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs). Here, we developed an optimized system that boosts the yield of SMSC-derived exosomes (SMSC-EXOs) and improves their miRNA profiles with an elevated proportion of beneficial miRNAs, while reducing harmful ones by pretreating SMSCs with Sr. Compared to untreated SMSC-EXOs, Sr-pretreated SMSC-derived exosomes (Sr-SMSC-EXOs) demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy by mitigating chondrocyte ferroptosis and reducing osteoclast-mediated joint pain in TMJOA. Our results illustrate Alix's crucial role in Sr-triggered miRNA loading, identifying miR-143-3p as a key anti-TMJOA exosomal component. Interestingly, this system is specifically oriented towards synovium-derived stem cells. The insight into trace element-driven, site-specific miRNA selectively loading in SMSC-EXOs proposes a promising therapeutic enhancement strategy for TMJOA.",

      "abstract": "Intrauterine adhesion (IUA) is an endometrial damage repair disorder that leads to menstrual loss, amenorrhea, and infertility in women; therefore, addressing this dilemma is a critical challenge. In this study, a multifunctional hydrogel, comprising oxidized sodium alginate (OSA), strontium carbonate (SrCO3), and betamethasone 21-phosphate sodium (BSP), was formulated to facilitate angiogenesis, reduce fibrosis, and support tissue repair in the treatment of IUA. The composite hydrogels showed significant bioactivity on human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), promoting the injured HESCs repair, reversing the degree of fibrosis to a certain extent, and enhancing the proliferation and migration of HUVECs. These results were also verified in the IUA model of sexually mature female rats. Compared with the model group, the selection of the appropriate hydrogel significantly increased endometrial thickness (p < 0.01), the number of glands (p < 0.001), decreased the degree of fibrosis (p < 0.05), and Vimentin (p < 0.01), CK19 (p < 0.01), CD31 (p < 0.01), and Ki67 (p < 0.01) molecular expression increased remarkably. In summary, in situ injection of this multifunctional hydrogel into the uterine cavity not only serves as a physical barrier, isolating the damaged endometrium, but also gradually releases drugs as the hydrogel degrades. This multifunctional hydrogel promotes endometrial proliferation and angiogenesis while reducing fibrosis, and provides therapeutic strategies for patients with clinical IUA.",

The structural stabilities of two distinct types of CB5-Ti3C2T2 (T = F, O and OH) complexes, i.e., CB5-Ti3C2T2(V) and CB5-Ti3C2T2(P) configurations are proved by binding energy and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Calculations of adsorption properties reveal that all the considered CB5-Ti3C2T2 complexes can act as efficient adsorbents for Sr ion, among which CB5-Ti3C2O2 complex possesses the best performance. The high affinity (the calculated adsorption energies < -7.6 eV) and selectivity of CB5-Ti3C2T2 complex for Sr ion are attributed to the synergistic effect between CB5 molecule and Ti3C2T2 MXene in the adsorption process, which arises from the multisite interactions of portal carbonyl groups of CB5 and surface functional groups of Ti3C2T2 towards Sr. Finally, CB5-Ti3C2T2 complex was successfully synthesized, and experimental results confirm its synergistic effect, good selectivity and high removal efficiency for Sr ions. In the treatment of strontium-containing wastewater with low concentrations, the distribution coefficient and decontamination factor of CB5-Ti3C2T2 for Sr were determined to be as high as 2.88 × 105 mL/g and 144.9, respectively, and the separation factor (SFSr/Ca) achieved a notable value of 67. 5. This work is expected to present a new strategy for the construction of high-performance MXene-based adsorbent for radionuclide elimination."

      "abstract": "Strontium-90 plesiotherapy delivers high doses of radiation to superficial lesions (<3 mm depth) with excellent sparing of deeper tissues. The sealed-source applicator tip is circular and 8-10 mm in diameter. Larger treatment fields are treated with multiple overlapping fields. The applicator cannot conform to angular extensions of irregularly shaped fields, resulting in unnecessary treatment of normal tissue, and overlapping fields can overdose in some areas. With strontium-90 sources that have high activity and thus a high dose rate, small variations in duration and position of placement can be even more consequential. This prospective investigation used radiochromic film to evaluate the dosimetry of adjacent, static, overlapping fields compared with that of the same target area treated with the applicator in continuous motion intended to achieve the prescribed exposure to all points within the target. The intent was to minimize over- and underdosed areas. Three shapes of target field were used: single 2 cm circle, curvilinear field, and cloverleaf. Application times were calculated to deliver the dose to the surface, and the procedure was repeated by four operators for qualitative evaluation (1 Gy/100 cGy to target) and four operators to generate quantitative data (5 Gy/500 cGy to target). We found significant differences between methods among operators, dependent on the number of fields, and in dose drop-off at the margin of the treated field. In almost every comparison, continuous motion was more homogenous (p ≤ .01 for standard deviation from expected dose). The continuous motion technique can be used for strontium plesiotherapy when the applicator must be held.",

Although bone tissue engineering is a promising treatment for extensive osseous defects, orthopedic-implant-related infections increase the likelihood of failure. Bioactive glass (BG) has been widely used in the manufacture of artificial bone scaffolds, owing to its excellent biocompatibility and osteoinductivity. Nevertheless, considering that infection conditions and trauma can affect the osteogenic capacity of bioactive glass, this study combined BG with magnesium and strontium to promote osteogenesis and confer significant antimicrobial activity. Novel bioactive glass doped with magnesium-strontium (BGMSN) with good biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial properties, and promising osteogenic induction ability was constructed from 45S5, Mg, and Sr carbonates via a melt-quenching approach. The results of an in vitro cell biocompatibility study indicated that the BGMSN exhibited good cellular compatibility. Furthermore, osteogenic alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and osteopontin genes were upregulated upon BGMSN/MC3T3-E1 coculture. BGMSN exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus mutans. Animal experiments further demonstrated the exceptional bone-inducing ability of BGMSN. Accordingly, owing to their excellent antimicrobial properties, BGMSN can be used for bone regeneration, particularly under infected conditions."

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 163 patients (186 eyes, 333 tumors) treated with brachytherapy (106Ru or 90Sr plaques) for intraocular retinoblastoma between November 2007 and August 2023. RESULTS: Complete tumor control was achieved in 273 tumors (82%). Incomplete tumor control was observed in 44 tumors (13%). Thirteen tumors presented with tumor progression. Three tumors relapsed after brachytherapy. On multivariate statistical analysis apex dose ≤ 85 Gy (for 106Ru) (p = 0.03), dark fundus pigmentation (p = 0.005) and intraarterial chemotherapy-brachytherapy period < 2 months (p = 0.001) demonstrated significant effect on brachytherapy insufficiency. Radiation-induced complications occurred in 62 eyes (33%). The most frequent complications were nonproliferative retinopathy (n = 39, 21%), optic neuropathy (n = 29, 16%) and vitreous hemorrhage (n = 29, 16%). Multivariate statistical analysis showed central localization (p = 0.005), tumor thickness > 2.7 mm (p = 0.04) and larger plaque diameter (>14 mm) (p = 0.035) to be the most significant variables for brachytherapy-associated complications. Eye retention was achieved in 91% of the treated eyes (n = 169). 17 eyes (9%) were enucleated. The reasons for enucleation were tumor recurrence or uncontrolled tumor growth (n = 7), anterior chamber involvement (n = 3), recurrent active vitreous seeding (n = 1), inability of adequate tumor monitoring due to opaque media (dense total vitreous hemorrhage or total retinal detachment) (n = 3), subatrophy of the eye with functional blindness (n = 3). CONCLUSION: Overall, Beta-ray brachytherapy proved to be a highly effective method of retinoblastoma treatment with excellent local tumor control, eye preservation rate and acceptable incidence of curable radiation-induced complications.",

      "abstract": "Wound dressing development is an area of active research. Traditional dressings lack antibacterial activity, biocompatibility, and tissue regeneration. Alginate is a heavily investigated polymer employed as wound dressings and can be combined with a wide range of additives. Herein, we report the preparation of alginate gel using the crosslinking technique as potential wound dressing, with insight investigation of the influence of employing single, two, or three cross-linkers: Strontium (Sr), zinc oxide (ZnO), and gentamicin sulfate. Rheology was used to confirm the gel's preparation, where the samples' viscosity curves show decreased viscosity with increased shear rate, indicating pseudoplastic flow. The linear viscoelastic region shows constant G' and G\" within the sample structure. In this study, we used three gels with different mixtures of ingredients: Gels A, B, and C contain sodium alginate (1% w/v) and 0.5 mL of Sr nitrate (4% w/v). However, Gels B and C contain 0.25 mL of ZnO (0.5% w/v). Gel C also includes 0.1 mL of gentamicin (1% w/v). The study examined the effectiveness of Gel A, B, and C on wound healing, calculating the reduction of wound area after seven, 14, and 20 days of a single topical treatment. Gel A, B, and C significantly reduced wound area, while Gel B and C showed a significant reduction. The zone of inhibition was used to detect the gels' efficacy against microorganisms. The study found zinc deposition in the liver and bone, with Gel B and C showing higher levels. The study also found significant overexpression of MIP α and MIP β in tissues and downregulation of CCL2, IL8, and TGF β, explaining wound healing with minimal scar formation.",

      "abstract": "Local delivery of therapeutic ions from bioactive mesoporous glasses (MBGs) is postulated as one of the most promising strategies for regenerative therapy of critical bone defects. Among these ions, Sr2+ cation has been widely considered for this purpose as part of the composition of MBGs. MBGs of chemical composition 75SiO2-25-x CaO-5P2O5-xSrO with x = 0, 2.5 and 5 (% mol) were prepared by the evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) method. Strontium incorporation did not affect the apatite forming ability of Sr-free MBG when these bioceramics are treated with simulated body fluid (SBF). In vitro cell viability showed that proliferation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast is not affected by the presence of Sr2+ cations, whereas ALP activity and gene expression of Runx2, ALP and VEGF is increased as a function of Sr content. Besides, cell proliferation and VEGF expression of HUVEC cells were also increased with the Sr2+ content. In this work, we present for the first time the effects of Sr containing MBGs on bone regeneration in a large animal model (sheep), after implantation in a cavitary defect. The histomorphometrical analysis and immunohistochemistry indicate that the incorporation of Sr2+ ion greatly enhances the osteoregenerating potential of MBGs. In this sense, the measured ossification areas were 7 % and 20 % for MBG and Sr-MBG, respectively. Besides, the thickness of the newly formed trabeculae was 15 μm and 30 μm for MBG and Sr-MBG, respectively. This enhancement of Sr2+ mediated bone formation would be justified by the transient osteoclastogenesis inhibition and the osteogenesis-angiogenesis increase due to the endothelial cell proliferation and increased vascular endothelial growth factor expression.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, poses a significant health challenge, particularly for aging populations. Systemic treatments often lead to adverse side effects, emphasizing the need for localized solutions. This study introduces a 3D-printed polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold embedded with strontium-substituted mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles (Sr-MBGNPs) and icariin (ICN) for the targeted regeneration of osteoporotic bone. The scaffold was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), ion release studies, and cellular assays, which confirmed its dual functionality in both enhancing osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. The optimized Sr-MBGNP concentration ensured sustained ion release, superior hydrophilicity, and bioactivity without compromising scaffold integrity. Additionally, e-jet printing provided high precision and uniform pore sizes conducive to cellular activity. This novel scaffold platform demonstrates a promising localized treatment strategy, reducing systemic side effects while improving fixation stability. The innovative integration of Sr-MBGNPs and ICN highlights its potential to revolutionize osteoporosis therapy by promoting bone regeneration and mitigating bone resorption.",

      "abstract": "Naked siRNAs are sensitive to enzymatic degradation, phagocytic entrapment, quick renal excretion, membrane impermeability, endosomal escape, and off-target effects. Designing a safe and efficient nanocarrier for siRNA delivery to the target site without toxicity remains a significant hurdle in gene therapy. CA is a unique derivative of hydroxyapatite and a highly pH-sensitive nanocarrier with strong particle aggregation and a high polydispersity index. Strontium (Sr2+), a group two divalent metal in the periodic table, has been reported for substituting calcium (Ca2+) ions from the apatite lattice and limiting particle growth/aggregation. This study used strontium chloride hexahydrate (SrCl2·6H2O) salt to develop a Sr-substituted CA (Sr-CA) nanocarrier with ∼30 nm size, spherical shape, less aggregation, homodispersity, and a fair anionic charge. Sr-CA demonstrated a large surface area-to-volume ratio, an improved cargo loading efficiency, and enhanced cellular uptake in HEK-293 cells. Moreover, Sr-CA is a pH-responsive nanocarrier responsible for its long physiological stability, efficient endosomal escape, and optimal cargo delivery within cells. These NPs have differential effects on MAPK1, MAP2K4, PIK3Ca, CAMK4, and p53 gene expression in HEK-293 cells without showing any significant cytotoxicity in cell growth properties. Gene silencing by Sr-CA-mediated siRNA delivery against MAPK1, MAP2K4, PIK3Ca, and CAMK4 genes significantly decreased the level of target gene expression and cell survival, demonstrating successful intracellular siRNA delivery in HEK-293 cells. Additionally, biocompatibility testing confirmed the biological safety of the Sr-CA nanocarrier in mice. These findings suggest that Sr-CA nanocarriers are a promising siRNA delivery system, combining high efficiency with pH-sensitive release and excellent biocompatibility, making them a viable option for future therapeutic applications.",

According to the different coating materials, it could be divided into the PEEK group, PEEK-ALN group, PEEK-Sr group and PEEK-ALN-Sr group. After completing the mechanical analyses, the materials were implanted into the femoral condyles of New Zealand rabbits and the osteogenic capacity of the bracket materials was assessed by Micro-CT scanning, histology and fluorescence staining. The results showed that ALN and Sr were successfully loaded onto the surface of the material, and the elastic modulus and porosity of the material were not changed significantly after loading. The Micro-CT revealed that the PEEK-ALN-Sr group exhibited differences in bone volume/total Volume (BV/TV), trabecular spacing (TB.Sp),trabecular thickness (TB.Th)and trabeculae number (TB.N) in comparison to the PEEK group and PEEK-ALN group. And more new bone tissues could be observed in the PEEK-ALN-Sr group under 3D reconstruction of the bone proliferation model, toluidine blue and fluorescence staining. Thus, we can conclude that the 3D printed porous PEEK material has stable pore size and porosity, which has an ideal structure for bone growth. The PEEK- ALN-Sr composite material can be used as an emerging bone implant due to its excellent elastic modulus and osseointegration ability and provides a clinically viable treatment for patients with bone defects."

      "abstract": "Treatment of large-size bone defects is difficult, and acquiring autografts may be challenging due to limited availability. A synthetic patient-specific bone substitute can be developed by using 3D printing technologies in such cases. In the present study, we have developed photocurable composite resins with poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) containing a high percentage of biodegradable bioactive strontium-substituted nanohydroxyapatite (SrHA, size 30-70 nm). These photocurable resins have then been employed to develop high-surface-area 3D-printed bone substitutes using the digital light processing (DLP) technique. To enhance the surface area of the 3D-printed substitute, cryogels alone and functionalized with bioactive components of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and zoledronic acid (ZA) were filled within the 3D-printed scaffold/substitute. The scaffolds were tested in vitro for biocompatibility and functionality in vivo in two therapeutically relevant rat models with large bone defects (4 mm). The porosities of 3D printed scaffolds were found to be 60.1 ± 0.9%, 72.9 ± 0.5%, and 74.3 ± 1.6% for PTMC, PTMC-HA, and PTMC-SrHA, respectively, which is in the range of cancellous bone (50-95%). The thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated the fabrication of 3D printed composites with HA and SrHA concentrations of 51.5 and 57.4 wt %, respectively, in the PTMC matrix. The tensile Young's modulus (E), compressive moduli, and wettability increased post incorporation of SrHA and HA in the PTMC matrix. In vitro and in vivo results revealed that SrHA integrated into the PTMC matrix exhibited good physicochemical and biological properties. Furthermore, the osteoactive molecule-functionalized 3D printed composite scaffolds were found to have an adequate osteoconductive and osteoinductive surface that has shown increased bone regeneration and defect repair in both tibial and cranial bone defects. Our findings thus support the use of PTMC-SrHA composites as next-generation patient-specific synthetic bioactive biodegradable bone substitutes.",

RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OpG) in serum were measured. The gap between the first and second molar and root resorption were examined. Osteoclast test was used; and root condition was examined. Detection of miR-155-5p, circBACH1, CLC7 and cathepsin K was performed. The binding of circBACH1 to miR-155-5p was verified. In OTM rats, circBACH1 was elevated (p<0.05) and miR-155-5p was silenced (p<0.05). SR reduced osteoclast activity (p<0.05) and improved root resorption (p<0.05) in OTM rats, which was enhanced by silenced circBACH1 (p<0.05) or elevated miR-155-5p (p<0.05). circBACH1 inhibited miR-155-5p expression (p<0.05). Silenced miR-155-5p reversed the ameliorative effect of circBACH1 on tooth root resorption in OTM rats (all p<0.05).

      "abstract": "Selective uptake and elution of trace amounts of hazardous radioactive 90Sr from large-scale high-level liquid waste (HLW) is crucial for sustainable development. Here, we propose a site differentiation strategy, based on the presence of distinct selective metal capture sites (concavity site and tweezer site) within the giant polyoxoniobate (PONb) nanoclusters of an all-inorganic PONb framework (FZU-1). Through this strategy, FZU-1 can not only effectively remove 98.9% of Sr²⁺ from simulated nuclear liquid waste, performing best among the reported Sr adsorbents, but also achieve desorption of adsorbed Sr²⁺ ions by selectively loading Na⁺ ions, thus enabling the recycling of FZU-1. Based on the well-defined single-crystal structures and theoretical studies, it can be revealed that the rapid and selective uptake of Sr²⁺ is attributed to the strong binding energy between the Sr²⁺ ions and the concavity sites. The effective elution of Sr²⁺, on the other hand, stems from the preferential binding of Na⁺ ions at the tweezer sites, elevating the cluster's electrostatic potential and indirectly facilitating the elution of Sr²⁺ ions. The exceptional stability of FZU-1, along with its rapid and selective Sr²⁺ capture and elution capabilities, positions it as a promising candidate for large-scale nuclear waste treatment and groundwater remediation applications."

      "abstract": "Surface treatments play an important role in enhancing the osseointegration of Titanium (Ti) and its alloys. This study introduces a method employing biomimetic hydroxyapatite (Hap) deposition guided by molecularly organized phospholipids, affixed to the metal implant surface. Using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, phospholipids were deposited onto Ti-screws by using CaCl2 or CaCl2/SrCl2 aqueous solution in the subphase of a Langmuir trough in the target proportion (i.e. 10 and 90 mol% of Sr2+ in relation of Ca2+) followed by immersion in phosphate buffer and in supersaturated simulated body fluid. Coating composition and morphology were evaluated using infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively, while contact angle measurements assessed coating wettability and surface energy. Randomized screws were then implanted into the tibias of healthy and osteoporotic female rats (G1: Control-Machined, G2: Hap, G3: HapSr10, G4: HapSr90). Osseointegration, assessed 60 days post-implantation, included reverse torque, fluorochrome area, bone tissue-screw contact area, and linear extent of bone-screw contact. Results, grouped by surface treatment (Machined, Hap, HapSr10, HapSr90), revealed that the deposition of Hap, HapSr10, and HapSr90 resulted in thin and rough coatings composed of hydroxyapatite (Hap) on the screw surface with nanoscale pores. The coatings resulted in increased wettability and surface energy of Ti surfaces. The minerals are chemically similar to natural bone apatite as revealed by FTIR analysis. In vivo analyses indicated higher torque values for strontium-containing surfaces in the osteoporotic group (p = 0.02) and, in the control group superior torque for screw removal on the Hap surface (p = 0.023). Hydroxyapatite-treated surfaces enhance morphology, composition, and reactivity, promoting screw osseointegration in healthy and osteoporotic female rats. The incorporation of strontium into the mineral phase has been proposed to not only stimulate osteoblast activity but also reduce osteoclastic resorption, which may explain the improved outcomes observed here in experimental osteoporotic conditions.",

Colored water must be filtered and sterilized before it can be used for irrigation. The utilization of metal oxide and nanocomposite materials in wastewater treatment procedures appears to be a viable option for the future. Therefore, different compounds were doped with graphene oxide to identify the best material for dye removal by the adsorption process. According to recent studies, the ideal conditions for graphene oxide-doped magnesium oxide (GO/MgO) are as follows: pH 10 showed the highest adsorption capacity (qe) at 49.4 mg/g; an adsorbent dosage of 0.01 g/50 mL showed 48.3 mg/g qe; a shaking time of 30 min resulted in 44.2 mg/g qe; an initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L yielded 53.6 mg/g qe; and a temperature of 35 °C gave 49.5 mg/g qe. For graphene oxide-doped strontium titanate (GO/SrTiO3), the optimum conditions were as follows: pH 10 with 45.8 mg/g qe; an adsorbent dose of 0.01 g/50 mL with 40.5 mg/g qe; a shaking time of 30 min with 75 mg/g qe; and a temperature of 35 °C with 44.7 mg/g qe. Graphene oxide-doped cobalt and iron-doped lanthanum chromium titanate (GO/Co.Fe.LaCrO3) showed optimum conditions of pH 9 with 34.2 mg/g qe; an adsorbent dose of 0.01 g/50 mL with 27.5 mg/g qe; a shaking time of 45 min with 33.2 mg/g qe; an initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L with 37.6 mg/g qe; and a temperature of 35 °C with 42.5 mg/g qe. Graphene oxide-doped cadmium sulfide (GO/CdS) showed the following optimum conditions: pH 8 with 23.1 mg/g qe; an adsorbent dose of 0.01 g/50 mL with 25.5 mg/g qe; an initial dye concentration of 75 mg/L with 28.3 mg/g qe; and a temperature of 35 °C with 33.5 mg/g qe. The pseudo-first-order model was the best fit only for graphene oxide-doped magnesium oxide (GO/MgO) with an R2 value of 0.966, while the pseudo-second-order adsorption isotherm was the best fit for all four products, with R2 values ranging from 0.991 to 0.998. Additionally, the Langmuir adsorption isotherms provided good results for all four products, with R2 values ranging from 0.957 to 0.985. The Freundlich adsorption kinetics showed satisfactory fit only for graphene oxide-doped magnesium oxide (GO/MgO) and graphene oxide-doped cadmium sulfide (GO/CdS), with R2 values of 0.951 and 0.982, respectively. To examine the characteristics and practicality of the adsorption process, certain thermodynamic variables were calculated. The adsorption capability of the most efficient nanocomposites for the degradation of basic red-46 was significantly affected by various concentrations of heavy metal ions and electrolytes. In dye solutions containing surfactants/detergents, the adsorption efficiency of several effective photocatalysts for basic dyes was significantly reduced. A 0.5 M HCl solution was found to be the most effective for desorption. In column investigations, the optimal bed height, flow velocity, and dye intake levels were determined to be 3 cm, 1.8 mL/min, and 70 mg/L, respectively, for maximal adsorption of basic red-46. The adsorption investigation of genuine textile waste products has also been carried out to facilitate the practical deployment of this approach. The methods used in this study were cost-effective, easy to handle, and eco-friendly and involved no hazardous materials in the synthesis, making the resulting materials non-hazardous. All these methods were part of green chemistry."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the osseointegration of titanium (Ti) implants with micro-nano textured surfaces functionalized with strontium additions (Sr) in a pre-clinical rat tibia model. METHODOLOGY: Ti commercially pure (cp-Ti) implants were installed bilaterally in the tibia of 64 Holtzman rats, divided into four experimental groups (n=16/group): (1) Machined surface - control (C); (2) Micro-nano textured surface treatment (MN); (3) Micro-nano textured surface with Sr2+ addition (MNSr); and (4) Micro-nano textured surface with a higher complementary addition of Sr2+ (MNSr+). In total, two experimental euthanasia periods were assessed at 15 and 45 days (n=8/period). The tibia was subjected to micro-computed tomography (μ-CT), histomorphometry with the EXAKT system, removal torque (TR) testing, and gene expression analysis by PCR-Array of 84 osteogenic markers. Gene expression and protein production of bone markers were performed in an in vitro model with MC3T3-E1 cells. The surface characteristics of the implants were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and laser scanning confocal microscopy. RESULTS: SEM, confocal, and EDS analyses demonstrated the formation of uniform micro-nano textured surfaces in the MN group and Sr addition in the MNSr and MNSr+ groups. TR test indicated greater osseointegration in the 45-day period for treated surfaces. Histological analysis highlighted the benefits of the treatments, especially in cortical bone, in which an increase in bone-implant contact was found in groups MN (15 days) and MNSr (45 days) compared to the control group. Gene expression analysis of osteogenic activity markers showed modulation of various osteogenesis-related genes. According to the in vitro model, RT-qPCR and ELISA demonstrated that the treatments favored gene expression and production of osteoblastic differentiation markers. CONCLUSIONS: Micro-nano textured surface and Sr addition can effectively improve and accelerate implant osseointegration and is, therefore, an attractive approach to modifying titanium implant surfaces with significant potential in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long-term physical inactivity probably leads to a co-existence of osteoporosis and sarcopenia which result in a high risk of falls, fractures, disability and even mortality. However, universally applicable and feasible approaches are lacking in the concurrent treatment of osteoporosis and sarcopenia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of strontium zinc silicate bioceramic (SZS) extract on osteoporosis and sarcopenia and explored its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Hindlimb osteoporosis and sarcopenia were established in a tail-suspended rat model. The bones were conducted μCT scanning, histological examination, and gene expression analysis, and the muscles were conducted histological examination and gene expression analysis. In vitro, the effect of SZS extract on osteoblasts was determined by alizarin red S staining, immunofluorescence and qPCR. Similarly, the effect of SZS extract on myoblasts was determined by immunofluorescence and qPCR.. At last, the role of Piezo1 and the change of intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) were explored through blockading the Piezo1 by GsMTx4 in MC3T3-E1 and C2C12 cells, respectively. RESULTS: We found that SZS extract could concurrently and efficiently prevent bone structure deterioration, muscle atrophy and fibrosis in hind limbs of the tail-suspended rats. The in vivo study also showed that SZS extract could upregulate the mRNA expression of Piezo1, thereby maintaining the homeostasis of bones and muscles. In vitro study demonstrated that SZS extract could promote the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 and C2C12 cells by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ in a Piezo1-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that SZS extract could increase Piezo1-mediated intracellular Ca2+, and facilitate osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast and myogenic differentiation of myoblasts, contributing to alleviation of osteoporosis and sarcopenia in a tail-suspended rat model. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: The current study might provide a universally applicable and efficient strategy to treat musculoskeletal disorders based on bioactive ceramics. The verification of the role of Piezo1-modulated intracellular Ca2+ during osteogenesis and myogenesis provided a possible therapeutic target against mechanical related diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Calcium silicate-based bioceramics have been applied in endodontics as advantageous materials for years, many chemical components and new synthesizing methods were used to improve the base formulation of the materials for positively affecting the sealers properties. Recently, a novel biomaterial formulation, grounded in strontium silicate, has been introduced to the market, offering potential advancements in the field. OBJECTIVE: To comparatively analyze the cytotoxicity and cell migration effects of a novel strontium silicate-based bioceramic material (CRoot SP) and those of calcium silicate-based (iRoot SP) and epoxide amine resin (AH Plus) sealers on stem cells derived from rat apical papilla(rSCAPs). METHODS: rSCAPs were isolated and characterized in vitro and subsequently cultured in the presence of various concentrations of CRoot SP, iRoot SP and AH Plus extracts. Cytotoxicity was assessed by CCK-8 assay, and cell-migration capacity was assessed by using wound healing assays . RESULTS: No significant differences in cell viability were observed in the 0.02 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL sealer groups. The cell viability of CRoot SP was consistently greater than that of iRoot SP at concentrations of 5 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL across all time points. Maximum cytotoxic effect was noted on day 5 with 10 mg/mL AH Plus.The scratch was partly healed by cell migration in all groups at 24 h, and the 0.02 mg/mL, and 0.2 mg/mL CRoot SP exerted beneficial effects on rSCAPs migration. CONCLUSIONS: CRoot SP exhibited less cytotoxic than the iRoot SP and AH Plus extracts after setting. A lower concentration of CRoot SP thus promotes the cell migration capacity of rSCAPs, and it may achieve better tissue repair during root canal treatment.",

      "abstract": "Divalent cations have captured the interest of researchers in biomedical and dental fields due to their beneficial effects on bone formation. These metallic elements are similar to trace elements found in human bone. Strontium is a divalent cation commonly found in various biomaterials. Since strontium has a radius similar to calcium, it has been used to replace calcium in many calcium-containing biomaterials. Strontium has the ability to inhibit bone resorption and increase bone deposition, making it useful in the treatment of osteoporosis. Strontium has also been used as a radiopacifier in dentistry and has been incorporated into a variety of dental materials to improve their radiopacity. Furthermore, strontium has been shown to improve the antimicrobial and mechanical properties of dental materials, promote enamel remineralization, alleviate dentin hypersensitivity, and enhance dentin regeneration. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive review of the applications of strontium in dentistry."

      "abstract": "The remarkable stability, suitable thermomechanical characteristics, and acceptable electrical properties of donor-doped strontium titanates make them attractive materials for fuel electrodes, interconnects, and supports of solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cells (SOFC/SOEC). The present study addresses the impact of processing and thermochemical treatment conditions on the electrical conductivity of SrTiO3-derived ceramics with moderate acceptor-type substitution in a strontium sublattice. A-site-deficient Sr0.85La0.10TiO3-δ and cation-stoichiometric Sr0.85Pr0.15TiO3+δ ceramics with varying microstructures and levels of reduction have been prepared and characterized by XRD, SEM, TGA, and electrical conductivity measurements under reducing conditions. The analysis of the collected data suggested that the reduction process of dense donor-doped SrTiO3 ceramics is limited by sluggish oxygen diffusion in the crystal lattice even at temperatures as high as 1300 °C. A higher degree of reduction and higher electrical conductivity can be obtained for porous structures under similar thermochemical treatment conditions. Metallic-like conductivity in dense reduced Sr0.85La0.10TiO3-δ corresponds to the state quenched from the processing temperature and is proportional to the concentration of Ti3+ in the lattice. Due to poor oxygen diffusivity in the bulk, dense Sr0.85La0.10TiO3-δ ceramics remain redox inactive and maintain a high level of conductivity under reducing conditions at temperatures below 1000 °C. While the behavior and properties of dense reduced Sr0.85Pr0.15TiO3+δ ceramics with a large grain size (10-40 µm) were found to be similar, decreasing grain size down to 1-3 µm results in an increasing role of resistive grain boundaries which, regardless of the degree of reduction, determine the semiconducting behavior and lower total electrical conductivity of fine-grained Sr0.85Pr0.15TiO3+δ ceramics. Oxidized porous Sr0.85Pr0.15TiO3+δ ceramics exhibit faster kinetics of reduction compared to the Sr0.85La0.10TiO3-δ counterpart at temperatures below 1000 °C, whereas equilibration kinetics of porous Sr0.85La0.10TiO3-δ structures can be facilitated by reductive pre-treatments at elevated temperatures."

Bioglasses were produced using the sol-gel method in the SiO2-P2O5-CaO system, for the purpose as composite ingredients. Their chemical composition was enriched with ZnO to introduce antibacterial properties and SrO with osteoinductive effect. The properties of bioglasses were compared and the effect of chemical composition and particle size on their biological properties was assessed. Methods: The bioglasses were evaluated via TG-DTA, FTIR, SEM-EDS analyses before and after incubation in SBF solution. LDH and WST-1 tests were used to determine the level of cytotoxicity of the tested bioglasses on hFOB1.19 osteoblasts. Results: The results show that the developed bioglasses release Ca2+, are bioactive in SBF solution, not cytotoxic and show antibacterial activity in contact with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus strains. Bioglasses enriched with ZnO show the highest bactericidal activity. All tested bioglasses enhanced hFOB 1.19 cells proliferation. Particle size has a lower effect on biological performance of the bioglasses than their chemical composition. Conclusions: The conducted research showed that bioglass modification with SrO and ZnO can be considered particularly for the development of biomaterials supporting bone regeneration and the treatment of infected bone defects.",

      "abstract": "Cartilage tissue engineering holds great promise for efficient cartilage regeneration. However, early inflammatory reactions to seed cells and/or scaffolds impede this process. Consequently, managing inflammation is of paramount importance. Moreover, due to the body's restricted chondrogenic capacity, inducing cartilage regeneration becomes imperative. Thus, a controlled platform is essential to establish an anti-inflammatory microenvironment before initiating the cartilage regeneration process. In this study, we utilized fifth-generation polyamidoamine dendrimers (G5) as a vehicle for drugs to create composite nanoparticles known as G5-Dic/Sr. These nanoparticles were generated by surface modification with diclofenac (Dic), known for its potent anti-inflammatory effects, and encapsulating strontium (Sr), which effectively induces chondrogenesis, within the core. Our findings indicated that the G5-Dic/Sr nanoparticle exhibited selective Dic release during the initial 9 days and gradual Sr release from days 3 to 15. Subsequently, these nanoparticles were incorporated into a gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel, resulting in GelMA@G5-Dic/Sr. In vitro assessments demonstrated GelMA@G5-Dic/Sr's biocompatibility with bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). The enclosed nanoparticles effectively mitigated inflammation in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 macrophages and significantly augmented chondrogenesis in BMSCs cocultures. Implanting BMSCs-loaded GelMA@G5-Dic/Sr hydrogels in immunocompetent rabbits for 2 and 6 weeks revealed diminished inflammation and enhanced cartilage formation compared to GelMA, GelMA@G5, GelMA@G5-Dic, and GelMA@G5/Sr hydrogels. Collectively, this study introduces an innovative strategy to advance cartilage regeneration by temporally modulating inflammation and chondrogenesis in immunocompetent animals. Through the development of a platform addressing the temporal modulation of inflammation and the limited chondrogenic capacity, we offer valuable insights to the field of cartilage tissue engineering.",

The electrochemical determination of acetaminophen (PCT) was studied with strontium molybdate with a functionalized carbon nanotube (SrMoO4@f-CNF) nanocomposite. The SrMoO4@f-CNF nanocomposite was produced by a facial hydrothermal followed by sonochemical treatment, resulting in a significant enhancement in the PCT determination. The sonochemical process was applied to incorporate SrMoO4 nanoparticles over f-CNF, enabling a network-like structure. Moreover, the produced SrMoO4@f-CNF composite structural, morphological, and spectroscopic properties were confirmed with XRD, TEM, and XPS characterizations. The synergistic effect between SrMoO4 and f-CNF contributes to the lowering of the charge transfer resistance (Rct=85 Ω·cm2), a redox potential of Epc=0.15 V and Epa=0.30 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), and a significant limit of detection (1.2 nM) with a wide response range of 0.01-28.48 µM towards the PCT determination. The proposed SrMoO4@f-CNF sensor was studied with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques and demonstrated remarkable electrochemical properties with a good recovery range in real-sample analysis."

Calcium silicate cements, such as Biodentine, are bioactive and offer excellent sealing ability, making them ideal for various dental treatments. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to fabricate bioactive calcium silicates infused with titanium (Ti) and strontium (Sr) to optimize their neo-angiogenic, antimicrobial, and regenerative properties while maintaining mechanical stability. METHODOLOGY: Ti- and Sr-infused calcium silicate cements were synthesized, and their mineral phases were characterized using X-ray diffraction. Morphological and elemental analyses were performed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Raman spectroscopy was used to confirm the formation of bioactive material. A hemocompatibility assessment was conducted to evaluate blood compatibility. RESULTS: The presence of Ca2, SiO4, and SrTiO3 mineral phases indicated the successful infusion of Ti and Sr into the calcium silicate cement. FESEM and EDS revealed interconnected small spheres and rods in the silicate network with the relevant elemental compositions. Raman spectra verified that Si-O-Si and Ti-O-Ti vibrations exist, validating the formation of a bioactive material. The hemocompatibility assessment demonstrated optimal blood compatibility. CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully fabricated an improved calcium silicate-based material with enhanced regenerative properties and excellent biocompatibility. This newly formed substrate holds promise for providing superior restorative solutions and aiding in conservative treatment modalities during dental procedures."

A bisphosphonate, etidronate, has been selected as a possible candidate due to its satisfying decorporation activity for uranium, bone tropism, and potential affinity with cobalt. Pre-clinical studies have been carried out on rats using radionuclide contamination and treatment administration by the intravenous route. The effectiveness of free or liposomal etidronate was evaluated, with an administration at 30 min, 48 h post-contamination with 60 Co. Regarding 85 Sr, a more extended experiment with etidronate liposomes was performed over 6 d. The results were compared to those performed with reference treatments, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid for cobalt and calcium gluconate for strontium. Unexpected results were found for the reference treatments that were significantly less effective than previously reported or showed no effectiveness. Free etidronate revealed no significant efficacy after 48 h, but the liposomal form suggested an interaction with radionuclides, not sufficient to change the biokinetics. This study emphasizes the need for early treatment administration and further research to provide a more effective medical countermeasure.",

The composite thin films feature BaxSr1-xTiO3 ferroelectric solid solution as the matrix and MgO linear dielectric as the reinforcement, with MgO concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 mol%. Following thermal treatment at 650 °C, the films were analyzed for their impedance response. Experimental impedance spectra were modeled using the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function, revealing stretching parameters (β) in the range of approximately 0.78 to 0.89 and 0.56 to 0.90 for impedance and electric modulus formalisms, respectively. Notably, films modified with 3 mol% MgO exhibited the least stretched relaxation function. Employing the electric equivalent circuit method for data analysis, the \"circle fit\" analysis demonstrated an increase in capacitance from 2.97 × 10-12 F to 5.78 × 10-10 F with the incorporation of 3 mol% MgO into BST-based thin films. Further analysis based on Voigt, Maxwell, and ladder circuits revealed trends in resistance and capacitance components with varying MgO contents, suggesting non-Debye-type relaxation phenomena across all tested samples."

Strontium is an example of an effective anti-osteoporotic agent, used in treating osteoporosis due to both anti-resorptive and anabolic mechanisms of action. Designing bone scaffolds with a higher capability of promoting bone regeneration is a topical research subject. In this study, we developed composite multi-layer three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for bone tissue engineering based on nano-hydroxyapatite (HA), Sr-containing nano-hydroxyapatite (SrHA), and poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) through the material extrusion fabrication technique. Previously obtained HA and SrHA with various Sr content were used for the composite material. The chemical, morphological, and biocompatibility properties of the 3D-printed scaffolds obtained using HA/SrHA and PCL were investigated. The 3D composite scaffolds showed good cytocompatibility and osteogenic potential, which is specifically recommended in applications when faster mineralization is needed, such as osteoporosis treatment."

      "abstract": "Titanium-based orthopedic implants are gaining popularity in recent years due to their excellent biocompatibility, superior corrosion resistance and lightweight properties. However, these implants often fail to perform effectively due to poor osseointegration. Nanosurface modification approaches may help to resolve this problem. In this work, TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays were fabricated on commercially available pure titanium (Ti) surfaces by anodization and annealing. Then, zinc (Zn) and strontium (Sr), important for cell signaling, were doped on the NT surface by hydrothermal treatment. This very simple method of Zn and Sr doping takes less time and energy compared to other complicated techniques. Different surface characterization tools such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), static water contact angle, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nanoindentation techniques were used to evaluate the modified surfaces. Then, adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) were cultured with the surfaces to evaluate cell adhesion, proliferation, and growth on the surfaces. After that, the cells were differentiated towards osteogenic lineage to evaluate alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin expression, and calcium phosphate mineralization. Results indicate that NT surfaces doped with Zn and Sr had significantly enhanced ADSC adhesion, proliferation, growth, and osteogenic differentiation compared to an unmodified surface, thus confirming the enhanced performance of these surfaces.",

This research aims to evaluate strontium's structural and biological effects on borate bioactive glass (BBG) and the influence of strontium concentrations (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% Sr) prepared via the sol-gel method. The study reveals significant findings related to the physicochemical properties of the glass. Immersion of the glass powders in a simulated body fluid (SBF) led to the development of a hydroxyapatite (HAP) layer on the glass surfaces. This transformation was verified through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses. In particular, 5% strontium exhibited gradual degradation, resulting in particle sizes below 100 nm. The BBG-15%Sr demonstrates heightened pathogenic activity as it shows a significant inhibition zone of 14 mm at 250 μg/mL, surpassing other substituted BBGs. It effectively combats Gram-positive bacteria, completely inhibiting MRSA growth at 50 μg/mL. This underscores its robust biofilm disruption capabilities, eradicating biofilms, even at minimal concentrations after prolonged exposure. C. elegans when subjected to BBG-15%Sr shows less ROS production when compared with the others. Moreover, the results suggest that the modified glass could be a potential material for the treatment of osteomyelitis-affected bone repair.",

Their morphological and chemical properties were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy/SEM, energy dispersive spectroscopy/EDS, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy/FTIR (n = 3). Their swelling capacity and degradation ratio were also measured (n = 4). Cell viability (n = 8), mineralized matrix formation, cell adhesion, and spreading (n = 6) on DPSCs were evaluated. Data were analyzed using ANOVA/post hoc tests (α = 5%). SEM and EDS characterization confirmed the incorporation of BG particles into the hydrogel matrix, showing GelMA's (C, O) and BG's (Si, Cl, Na, Sr) chemical elements. FTIR revealed the main chemical groups of GelMA and BG, as ~1000 cm-1 corresponds to Si-O and ~1440 cm-1 to C-H. All the formulations were degraded by day 12, with a lower degradation ratio observed for GelMA+BG20%. Increasing the concentration of BG resulted in a lower mass swelling ratio. Biologically, all the groups were compatible with cells (p > 0.6196), and cell adhesion increased over time, irrespective of BG concentration, indicating great biocompatibility. GelMA+BG5% demonstrated a higher deposition of mineral nodules over 21 days (p < 0.0001), evidencing the osteogenic potential of hydrogels. GelMA hydrogels incorporated with BG present great cytocompatibility, support cell adhesion, and have a clinically relevant degradation profile and suitable mineralization potential, supporting their therapeutic potential as promising biomaterials for pulp capping."

In this work, a new synthesis technique for the fabrication of nanostructured electrodes via in situ electrochemical polarization treatment is reported. The lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) precursor solution is infiltrated into a gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) scaffold presintered on a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, followed by in situ polarization current treatment at SOC operation temperatures. Electrode ohmic and polarization resistances decrease with an increase in the polarization current treatment. Detailed microstructure analysis indicates the formation of a convex-shaped interface between the LSCF nanoparticles (NPs) and the GDC scaffold, very different from the flat contact between LSCF and GDC observed after heating at 800 °C with no polarization current treatment. The embedded LSCF NPs on the GDC scaffold contribute to the superior stability under both fuel cell and electrolysis operation conditions at 750 °C and a high peak power density of 1.58 W cm-2 at 750 °C. This work highlights a novel and facile route to in situ construct a stable and high-performing nanostructured electrode for SOCs."

Here, efficient blue-emitting SrF2:Eu scintillating nanoparticles (ScNPs) are developed. The optimized synthesis conditions result in cubic nanoparticles with ≈32 nm diameter and blue emission at 416 nm. Coating them with the meso-tetra(n-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (TMPyP) in a core-shell structure (SrF@TMPyP) results in maximum singlet oxygen (1O2) generation upon X-ray irradiation for nanoparticles with 6TMPyP depositions (SrF@6TMPyP). The 1O2 generation is directly proportional to the dose, does not vary in the low-energy X-ray range (48-160 kVp), but is 21% higher when irradiated with low-energy X-rays than irradiations with higher energy gamma rays. In the clonogenic assay, cancer cells treated with SrF@6TMPyP and exposed to X-rays present a significantly reduced survival fraction compared to the controls. The SrF2:Eu ScNPs and their conjugates stand out as tunable nanoplatforms for X-PDT due to the efficient blue emission from the SrF2:Eu cores; the ability to adjust the scintillation emission in terms of color and intensity by controlling the nanoparticle size; the efficient 1O2 production when conjugated to a PS and the efficacy of killing cancer cells.",

In order to explore its promoting mechanism from the aspect of photosynthesis, the leaf characteristics, CO2 assimilation and chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence kinetics were investigated with hydroponically LC-Sr-treated Chinese cabbage seedlings. After a 28-d treatment to SrCl2 at different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mmol L-1), we observed an increase in the specific leaf weight (SLW) of Chinese cabbage compared with the control group. Notably, as the strontium concentration increased, a more pronounced improvement trend in the contents of Chl and protein in the leaves was observed, contributing to the enhancement of photosynthesis. However, the statistical differences in Pn among various LC-Sr treatments were not significant. Nevertheless, the leaf starch content exhibited a significant increase after LC-Sr treatments. Additionally, Chl a fluorescence transient has been used as a sensitive indicator of the promotional effect of LC-Sr on photosynthesis. The results of fluorescence parameters showed that LC-Sr treatments accelerated the light reaction speed of leaves (Tfm, dV/dto, dVG/dto), improved the energy utilization efficiency of photosystem (PSI and PSII) (ETo/CSo, ψET,ψRE, δRo, φRo), and ultimately enhanced the photosynthetic performance of leaves (PIabs, SFIabs, DFabs). The increased RCs/CSo and Sm contributed to the enhancement of the light reaction activity of strontium-treated leaves. The LC-Sr treatments had no interference with the calcium absorption, and notably enhanced the photosynthetic capacity of Chinese cabbage, shedding light on potential benefits of LC-Sr for crop cultivation.",

However, little is known about the photosynthetic performance of moss under nuclide treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the chlorophyll fluorescence of Racomitrium japonicum L. The moss was subjected to Sr2+ solutions at concentrations of 5, 50, and 500 mg/L to evaluate chlorophyll a fluorescence using the OJIP test. Moderate and high Sr2+ stress led to inner cell membrane dissolution and reduced chlorophyll content, indicating impaired light energy absorption. At 5 mg/L Sr2+, fluorescence kinetics showed increased light energy capture, energy dissipation, and total photosynthetic driving force, thus stimulating transient photosynthetic activity of PSII and improving PSI reduction. Linear electron transfer and PSII stability significantly decreased under moderate and high Sr2+ stress, indicating potential photosynthetic center damage. Cyclic electron transfer (CEF) alleviated photosynthetic stress at 5 mg/L Sr2+. Thus, low Sr2+ levels stimulated CEF, adjusting energy flux and partitioning to protect the photosynthetic apparatus. Nevertheless, significant damage occurred due to inefficient protection under high Sr2+ stress."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Adjacent segment disc degeneration (ASDD) is one of the long-term sequelae of spinal fusion, which is more susceptible with osteoporosis. As an anti-osteoporosis drug, strontium ranelate (SR) has been reported to not only regulate bone metabolism but also cartilage matrix formation. However, it is not yet clear whether SR has a reversal or delaying effect on fusion-induced ASDD in a model of osteoporosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifth three-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent L4-L5 posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF) with spinous-process wire fixation 4 weeks after bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) surgery. Animals were administered vehicle (V) or SR (900 mg/kg/d) orally for 12 weeks post-PLF as follows: Sham+V, OVX + V, PLF + V, OVX + PLF + V, and OVX + PLF + SR. Manual palpation and X-ray were used to evaluate the state of lumbar fusion. Adjacent-segment disc was assessed by histological (VG staining and Scoring), histomorphometry (Disc Height, MVD, Calcification rate and Vascular Bud rate), immunohistochemical (Col-II, Aggrecan, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4 and Caspase-3), and mRNA analysis (Col-I, Col-II, Aggrecan, MMP-13 and ADAMTS-4). Adjacent L6 vertebrae microstructures were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. RESULTS: Manual palpation and radiographs showed clear evidence of the fused segment's immobility. After 12 weeks of PLF surgery, a fusion-induced ASDD model was established. Low bone mass caused by ovariectomy can significantly exacerbate ASDD progression. SR exerted a protective effect on adjacent segment intervertebral disc with the underlying mechanism possibly being associated with preserving bone mass to prevent spinal instability, maintaining the functional integrity of endplate vascular microstructure, and regulating matrix metabolism in the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus. DISCUSSION: Anti-osteoporosis medication SR treatments not only maintain bone mass and prevent fractures, but early intervention could also potentially delay degenerative conditions linked to osteoporosis. Taken together, our results suggested that SR might be a promising approach for the intervention of fusion-induced ASDD with osteoporosis."

      "abstract": "The treatment of critical-sized bone defects has long been a major problem for surgeons. In this study, an intramedullary nail shaped three-dimensional (3D)-printed porous titanium implant that is capable of releasing strontium ions was developed through a simple and cost-effective surface modification technique. The feasibility of this implant as a stand-alone solution was evaluated using a rabbit's segmental diaphyseal as a defect model. The strontium-loaded implant exhibited a favorable environment for cell adhesion, and mechanical properties that were commensurate with those of a rabbit's cortical bone. Radiographic, biomechanical, and histological analyses revealed a significantly higher amount of bone ingrowth and superior bone-bonding strength in the strontium-loaded implant when compared to an untreated porous titanium implant. Furthermore, one-year histological observations revealed that the strontium-loaded implant preserved the native-like diaphyseal bone structure without failure. These findings suggest that strontium-releasing 3D-printed titanium implants have the clinical potential to induce the early and efficient repair of critical-sized, load-bearing bone defects.",

      "abstract": "Strontium (Sr) removal from water is required because excessive naturally occurring Sr exposure is hazardous to human health. Climate and seasonal changes cause water quality variations, in particular quality and quantity of organic matter (OM) and pH, and such variations affect Sr removal by nanofiltration (NF). The mechanisms for such variations are not clear and thus OM complexation and speciation require attention. Sr removal by NF was investigated with emphasis on the role of OM (type and concentration) and pH (2-12) on possible removal mechanisms, specifically size and/or charge exclusion as well as solute-solute interactions. The filtration results show that the addition of various OM (10 types) and an increase of OM concentration (2-100 mgC.L-1) increased Sr removal by 10-15%. The Sr-OM interaction was enhanced with increasing OM concentration, implying enhanced size exclusion via Sr-OM interaction as the main mechanism. Such interactions were quantified by asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (FFFF) coupled with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Both extremely low and high pH increased Sr removal due to the enhanced charge exclusion and Sr-OM interactions. This work elucidated and verified the mechanism of OM and pH on Sr removal by NF membranes.",

New ways of treating damaged tissues and organs are constantly being sought. A variety of porous structures are currently being investigated to support cell adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation. The selection of an appropriate biomaterial on which a patient's new tissue will develop is one of the key issues when designing a modern tissue scaffold and the associated treatment process. Among the numerous groups of biomaterials used to produce three-dimensional structures, hydroxyapatite (HA) deserves special attention. The aim of this paper was to discuss changes in the double electrical layer in hydroxyapatite with an incorporated boron and strontium/electrolyte solution interface. The adsorbents were prepared via dry and wet precipitation and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption and desorption methods. The specific surface area was characterized, and the surface charge density and zeta potential were discussed.",

However, subchondral bone repair remained suboptimal, potentially leading to damage to the regenerated overlying neocartilage. This study aimed to improve the bone repair potential of this scaffold by incorporating newly developed strontium (Sr) ion enriched amorphous calcium phosphate (Sr-ACP) granules (100-150 μm). Sr concentration of Sr-ACP was determined with ICP-MS at 2.49 ± 0.04 wt%. Then 30 wt% ACP or Sr-ACP granules were integrated into the scaffold prototypes. The ACP or Sr-ACP granules were well embedded and distributed in the collagen matrix demonstrated by micro-CT and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry. Good cytocompatibility of ACP/Sr-ACP granules and ACP/Sr-ACP enriched scaffolds was confirmed with in vitro cytotoxicity assays. An overall promising early tissue response and good biocompatibility of ACP and Sr-ACP enriched scaffolds were demonstrated in a subcutaneous mouse model. In a goat osteochondral defect model, significantly more bone was observed at 6 months with the treatment of Sr-ACP enriched scaffolds compared to scaffold-only, in particular in the weight-bearing femoral condyle subchondral bone defect. Overall, the incorporation of osteogenic Sr-ACP granules in Col/Col-Mg-HAp scaffolds showed to be a feasible and promising strategy to improve subchondral bone repair."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: When applied alone, titanium (Ti) mesh may not effectively block the penetration of soft tissues, resulting in insufficient new bone formation. This study aimed to confer bioactivity and improve bone regeneration by doping calcium phosphate (CaP) precipitation and strontium (Sr) ranelate onto a TiO₂ nanotube (TNT) layer on the surface of a Ti mesh. METHODS: The TNT layer was obtained by anodizing on the Ti mesh, and CaP was formed by cyclic pre-calcification. The final specimens were produced by doping with Sr ranelate. The surface properties of the modified Ti mesh were investigated using high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. To evaluate the effects of surface treatment on cell viability, osteoblasts were cultured for 1-3 days, and their absorbance was subsequently measured. In an in vivo experiment, critical-size defects were created in rat calvaria (Ф=8 mm). After 5 weeks, the rats were sacrificed (n=4 per group) and bone blocks were taken for micro-computed tomography and histological analysis. RESULTS: After immersing the Sr ranelate-doped Ti mesh in simulated body fluid, the protrusions observed in the initial stage of hydroxyapatite were precipitated as a dense structure. On day 3 of osteoblast culture, cell viability was significantly higher on the pre-calcified Sr ranelate-doped Ti mesh surface than on the untreated Ti mesh surface (P<0.05). In the in vivo experiment, a bony bridge formed between the surrounding basal bone and the new bone under the Sr ranelate-doped Ti mesh implanted in a rat calvarial defect, closing the defect. New bone mineral density (0.91±0.003 g/mm³) and bone volume (29.35±2.082 mm³) significantly increased compared to the other groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cyclic pre-calcification of a Ti mesh with a uniform TNT layer increased bioactivity, and subsequent doping with Sr ranelate effectively improved bone regeneration in bone defects."

      "abstract": "Background Antioxidants are vital in reducing oxidative stress, a key factor in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of our study is to analyze and compare the oxidative potential of biosynthesized selenium, strontium, and zinc oxide nanoparticles (NPs). Materials and methods Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) were synthesized using 20 mM of sodium selenite as the precursor and 1 g each of Cymbopogon citratus and Syzygium aromaticum as reducing and stabilizing agents. Strontium nanoparticles (SrNPs) were synthesized with 30 mM of strontium chloride as the precursor and 1 g of Acacia nilotica as a reducing and stabilizing agent. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) were synthesized using 30 mM of zinc nitrate as the precursor and 1 g each of Cuminum cyminum and Syzygium aromaticum as reducing and stabilizing agents. Selenium, strontium, and zinc oxide nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. The antioxidant activity of biogenically synthesized strontium, selenium and zinc oxide nanoparticles was examined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay (DPPH assay) and hydroxyl radical scavenging assay (H2O2 assay). Results The FT-IR spectra of selenium nanoparticles revealed a peak at 3327.990 cm-1, strontium nanoparticles at 3332.331 cm-1, and zinc oxide nanoparticles at 3216.346 cm-1. The significant results for the green-synthesized selenium, strontium, and zinc oxide nanoparticles were observed in antioxidant assays. The results from the DPPH assay show that at the highest concentration of 50 µL, SrNPs exhibited 90.12 % inhibition, SeNPs displayed 90.12% inhibition, and ZnONPs showed 89.55% inhibition. In the H2O2 assay, at the highest concentration of 50 µL, SrNPs showed 87.43% inhibition, SeNPs displayed 85.11% inhibition, and ZnONPs exhibited 84.66% inhibition. SrNPs demonstrated a higher percentage of inhibition in both the DPPH and H2O2 assays. Maximum inhibitory activity was observed at the highest concentration. However, the prepared nanoparticles showed a slightly lower percentage of inhibition when compared to the standard. Conclusion Strontium nanoparticles synthesized based on Acacia nilotica demonstrated excellent antioxidant activity compared to the synthesized selenium and zinc oxide nanoparticles. Therefore, the study suggests that the produced strontium nanoparticles can serve as an antioxidant agent, owing to their remarkable free radical scavenging activity."

METHODS: Ninety individuals with white spot lesions on their enamel who visited the orthodontic department for de-bonding were selected for the research. Patients were randomly assigned to three distinct groups with each group consisting of 30 patients. Group 1 served as the control and received regular dentifrice, Group 2 received strontium-doped nano-hydroxyapatite paste, and Group 3 received casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate topical cream. Patients were instructed to locally apply a specified amount of the prescribed preparation twice daily for six weeks. The data were analysed using the statistical programme SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and the level of significance had been set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Group 1 did not show any change in the enamel following the application of toothpaste. Both Group 2 and 3 demonstrated higher post-treatment scores, indicating effective remineralization potential (p < 0.001). However, Group 2 (strontium-doped nano-hydroxyapatite paste) displayed significantly greater remineralization capacity when compared to group 3 (casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate topical cream). CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional dentifrice and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate paste, strontium-doped nano-hydroxyapatite preparation demonstrated greater enamel remineralization of the white spot lesions and favourable surface alterations in the enamel surface. strontium-doped nano-hydroxyapatite can be utilised safely and efficiently to treat early caries and remineralise white spot lesions on the enamel."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both Strontium Ranelate (SR) and Calcitonin (CT) can be used to treat osteoporosis. Calcitonin was actually one of the very initial medicines used to treat osteoporosis, especially in postmenopausal cases. However, the fracture prevention effect of Calcitonin is only proven to be in vertebrae and that too with nasal route only. When comparing Calcitonin with other conventional medications in treating osteoporosis, Calcitonin has got no additional advantages. Strontium Ranelate has got double effect, i.e., less bone resorption and more bone formation. Therefore, it can lead to an increase in bone mass significantly. Strontium Ranelate has been proven to decrease the risk of non-vertebral fractures as well as vertebral fractures. CONCLUSION: Both Calcitonin and Strontium Ranelate are used only as a second-line therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis and not as first-line therapy, mainly because of their safety concern and also because they do not provide any advantages compared to other therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis."

METHODS: Phytic acid, which can form chelate with Mg2+, was used to modify magnesium oxychloride cement, and the effects of phytic acid on the strength, in vitro degradation and biological activity of magnesium oxychloride cement were studied. Based on the preparation of phytic acid modified magnesium oxychloride cement with good water resistance and biological activity, osteoporosis treatment strontium ranelate was loaded on phytic acid- magnesium oxychloride cement, strontium ranelate/phytic acid-magnesium oxychloride cement was prepared. RESULTS: It was found that the compressive strength of 1.25 wt% phytic acid-magnesium oxychloride cement after soaking in SBF for 28 d could reach 40.5 ± 2.0 MPa, 13.33% higher than that of the control group (when phytic acid was 0 wt%), and the mass loss rate of all ages was lower than that of the control group. The water resistance of magnesium oxychloride cement was effectively improved by phytic acid. After loading with strontium ranelate, the water resistance of 1.25 wt% phytic acid-magnesium oxychloride cement was improved. Cell experiments showed that strontium ranelate could effectively promote cell proliferation and improve the expression of osteoblast-related proteins. When strontium ranelate/phytic acid-magnesium oxychloride cement samples were implanted subcutaneously in rats for 4 w, no obvious inflammatory response was observed, and the material was tightly bound to the surrounding tissues. When bone cement was implanted into rat femur for 4 w, the bone cement was gradually wrapped and absorbed by new bone tissue, which grew from the outside to the inside, indicating that the bone cement containing strontium ranelate/phytic acid-magnesium oxychloride cement had excellent bone-forming ability. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results indicated that strontium ranelate/phytic acid-magnesium oxychloride cement composite bone cement had a potential application prospect in clinical bone repair."

      "abstract": "Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is a common nutritional metabolic disease in ruminants that causes significant economic losses to dairy farming. Strontium (Sr) is known to be involved in bone metabolism and exhibits potent anti-inflammatory effects. To evaluate the effect of Sr on inflammation in bovine ruminal epithelial cells, a model of LPS-induced inflammation was established in this study, and the cell viability of bovine ruminal epithelial cells was measured using CCK-8. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was measured by ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively. The related proteins of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway were assayed through Western blotting, and the fluorescence of p-p65 and p-IκB were assayed by immunofluorescence. Molecular docking of Sr and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway-related proteins was performed using MIB2 ( http://bioinfo.cmu.edu.tw/MIB2/ ). Results showed that after treatment for 24 h, the cell viability was decreased at the high concentration of Sr (≥ 10 mmol/L). Sr significantly decreased the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, downregulated the related proteins expression of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, and reduced the fluorescence levels of p-p65 and p-IκB. The NF-κB pathway inhibitor PDTC and molecular docking further revealed that Sr reduced LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. These results suggest that Sr reduces LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, thereby exerting an anti-inflammatory effect in bovine ruminal epithelial cells, providing a basis for Sr in the treatment of bovine rumen acidosis disease.",

The advancement of nanotechnology has paved the way for the incorporation of bioactive compounds in orthodontic materials especially orthodontic composites for prevention and management of WSLs. The present study aims to prepare, characterize, and then incorporate copper and strontium doped nanohydroxyapatite into orthodontic composite material and test its antibacterial efficacy. Materials and methods The present in vitro study involved the preparation of the strontium and copper co-substituted hydroxyapatite (SrCuHA) nanoparticles (Nps) using the sol-gel method. The prepared Nps were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The Nps were incorporated into a commercially available orthodontic composite. The antimicrobial properties of the SrCuHA Nps-incorporated composite were tested using the Agar well diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus(S. aureus), Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Results The SrCuHA Nps were successfully prepared. EDAX, FTIR, and SEM analyses revealed the successful formation of the Nps. The SrCuHA-incorporated orthodontic composite at a higher concentration of 40 μl showed the maximum zone of inhibition (ZOI) against S. mutans. The control group showed the maximum ZOI against E. coli and the SrCuHA Nps-incorporated composite at 20 μl showed the maximum inhibition against S. aureus. Conclusion In the present study, successful preparation of SrCuHA Nps followed by incorporation in the orthodontic adhesive was done. The prepared nanoparticle was characterized and the SrCuHA Nps-incorporated orthodontic composite demonstrated comparable ZOI against S. mutans to the control."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gut microbiome is critical to our human health and is related to postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). Strontium ranelate (SrR) is an anti-osteoporosis oral drug that can promote osteoblast formation and inhibit osteoclast formation. However, the effect of SrR on gut microbiome has been rarely studied. Therefore, we investigated the effect of oral SrR on gut microbiome and metabolic profiles. RESULTS: In this study, we used ovariectomized (OVX) Sprague-Dawley rats to construct a PMO model and applied oral SrR for 6 weeks. The relative abundance of intestinal microbiome was investigated by 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) was used to analyze changes in metabolites of intestinal contents. Results demonstrated that 6-week oral SrR alleviated osteoporosis and significantly changed the composition of the gut microbiome and metabolic profiles of OVX rats. Ruminococcus, Akkermansia and Oscillospira were significantly enriched in the gut of OVX rats after 6-week oral SrR. Especially, the species R. albus showed the greatest importance by a random forest classifier between OVX and OVX_Sr group. The enrichment of R. albus in the gut was positively correlated with bone mineral density and the accumulation of lycopene and glutaric acid, which also significantly elevated after oral SrR. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered that oral SrR can improve bone health while stimulate the accumulation of gut microbe R. albus and metabolites (lycopene and glutaric acid). The results suggested possible connections between oral SrR and the gut-bone axis, which may provide new insight into the treatment/prevention of osteoporosis.",

We achieved this by utilizing hexagonal boron nitride (BN)-supported strontium cobaltite perovskite nanocomposites (SrCoO3/BN). The fabrication of the innovative bifunctional SrCoO3/BN nanocomposites involved a straightforward process of precipitation, followed by an annealing treatment and ultrasonication. The successful formation of these nanocomposites was corroborated through the application of diverse spectroscopic tools. Notably, as-prepared SrCoO3/BN nanocomposites exhibited a remarkable sensing platform for MTN, characterized by a notably low detection limit (11 nm), considerable sensitivity (3.782 μA μM-1 cm-2), and outstanding selectivity, alongside remarkable stability. Concurrently, these SrCoO3/BN nanocomposites demonstrated exceptional visible-light-driven photocatalytic efficacy for MTN degradation (99%) and complete mineralization. Our investigation systematically delved into the influence of operational parameters, including catalyst loading and the involvement of reactive oxidative species, in both the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic reactions. Drawing from these comprehensive studies, we have proposed plausible mechanisms for detecting and degrading MTN. Our findings pave the way for catalyst development, offering a unified solution for detecting and eliminating toxic organic compounds from the environment."

      "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a prevalent and debilitating condition characterized by chronic back pain and reduced quality of life. Strontium ranelate (SRR) is a compound traditionally used for treating osteoporosis via activating TGF-β1 signaling pathway. Recent studies have proved the anti-inflammatory effect of SRR on chondrocytes. Although the exact mechanism of IVDD remains unclear, accumulating evidences have emphasized the involvement of multifactorial pathogenesis including inflammation, oxidative stress damage, and etc. However, the biological effect of SRR on IVDD and its molecular mechanism has not been investigated. Firstly, this study proved the decreased expression of Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1(TGF-β1) in degenerated human intervertebral disc tissues. Subsequently, we confirmed for the first time that SRR could promote cell proliferation, mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress in human nucleus pulposus cells in vitro via increasing the expression of TGF-β1 and suppressing the Nuclear Factor Kappa-Light-Chain-Enhancer of Activated B Cells (NF-κB) pathway. The molecular docking result proved the interaction between SRR and TGF-β1 protein. To further verify this interaction, gain- and loss- of function experiments were conducted. We discovered that both TGF-β1 knockdown and overexpression influenced the activation of the NF-κB pathway. Taken together, SRR could mitigate IL-1β induced-cell dysfunction in human nucleus pulposus cells by regulating TGF-β1/NF-κB axis in vitro. Finally, the in vivo therapeutic effect of SRR on IVDD was confirmed. Our findings may contribute to the understanding of the complex interplay between inflammation and degenerative processes in the intervertebral disc and provide valuable insights into the development of targeted treatment-based therapeutics for IVDD.",

In this study, we develop a strategy for occluding DTs deeply and compactly via simple application of occlusion media including (poly-L-aspartic acid)‑strontium (PAsp‑strontium) and phosphate/fluoride. The bonding of strontium ions to poly-L-aspartic acid formed a positively charged PAsp‑strontium complexes. After application of 15 min each, the PAsp‑strontium and phosphate/fluoride rapidly penetrated into the DTs in turn via the electrostatic interaction, then occluded the DTs with crystals up to a depth of 150 μm. The occlusion within DTs was resistant to abrasive and acidic challenges. The occlusion media performed better than commercial desensitizers Duraphat and Gluma. Moreover, this strategy possessed sufficient biocompatible and excellent performance in vivo. The application of occlusion media would shed light on in the management of DH.",

In vitro testing showed good cytocompatibility on human preosteoblasts and ongoing dissolution of the MBG component. Neither the released strontium nor the BMG particles from the pS100G10 had a negative influence on cell viability. Forty-five female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to three different treatment groups: (1) pS100 (n = 15), (2) pS100G10 (n = 15), and (3) empty defect (n = 15). Twelve weeks after bilateral ovariectomy and multi-deficient diet, a 4 mm wedge-shaped fracture-defect was created at the metaphyseal area of the left femur in all animals. The originated fracture-defect was substituted with pS100 or pS100G10 or left empty. After six weeks, histomorphometrical analysis revealed a statistically significant higher bone volume/tissue volume ratio in the pS100G10 group compared to the pS100 (p = 0.03) and empty defect groups (p = 0.0001), indicating enhanced osteoconductivity with the incorporation of MBG. Immunohistochemistry revealed a significant decrease in the RANKL/OPG ratio for pS100 (p = 0.004) and pS100G10 (p = 0.003) compared to the empty defect group. pS100G10 showed a statistically higher expression of BMP-2. In addition, a statistically significant higher gene expression of alkaline phosphatase, osteoprotegerin, collagen1a1, collagen10a1 with a simultaneous decrease in RANKL, and carbonic anhydrase was seen in the pS100 and pS100G10 groups compared to the empty defect group. Mass spectrometric imaging by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) showed the release of Sr2+ ions from both pS100 and pS100G10, with a gradient into the interface region. ToF-SIMS imaging also revealed that resorption of the MBG particles allowed for new bone formation in cement pores. In summary, the current work shows better bone formation of the injectable pasty strontium-containing calcium phosphate bone cement with incorporated mesoporous bioactive glass compared to the bioactive-free bone cement and empty defects and can be considered for clinical application for osteopenic fracture defects in the future."

Bioglasses produced using the sol-gel method were subjected to thermal treatment in different regimes. Chitosan/bioglass composites were produced with a weight ratio. Bioglasses were evaluated via TG-DTA, FTIR, and SEM-EDS before and after incubation in simulated body fluid (SBF). The release of ions was tested. The cytocompatibility of the composites in contact with MG63 osteoblast-like cells was evaluated. The results showed that the presence of the crystalline phase decreased from 41.2-44.8% for nonmodified bioglasses to 24.2-24.3% for those modified with ZnO and 22.0-24.2% for those modified with SrO. The samples released Ca2+, Zn2+, and/or Sr2+ ions and were bioactive according to the SBF test. The highest cytocompatibility was observed for the composites containing nonmodified bioglasses, followed by those enriched with SrO bioglasses. The least cytocompatible were the composites containing ZnO bioglasses that released the highest amount of Zn2+ ions (0.58 ± 0.07 mL/g); however, those that released 0.38 ± 0.04 mL/g were characterised by acceptable cytocompatibility. The study confirmed that it is feasible to control the biological performance of chitosan/bioglass composites by adjusting the composition and heat treatment parameters of bioglasses."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bone mass accumulated in early adulthood is an important determinant of bone mass throughout the lifespan, and inadequate bone deposition may lead to associated skeletal diseases. Recent studies suggest that gut bacteria may be potential factors in boosting bone mass. Strontium (Sr) as a key bioactive element has been shown to improve bone quality, but the precise way that maintains the equilibrium of the gut microbiome and bone health is still not well understood. METHODS: We explored the capacity of SrCl2 solutions of varying concentrations (0, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg BW) on bone quality in 7-week-old male Wistar rats and attempted to elucidate the mechanism through gut microbes. RESULTS: The results showed that in a Wistar rat model under normal growth conditions, serum Ca levels increased after Sr-treatment and showed a dose-dependent increase with Sr concentration. Three-point mechanics and Micro-CT results showed that Sr exposure enhanced bone biomechanical properties and improved bone microarchitecture. In addition, the osteoblast gene markers BMP, BGP, RUNX2, OPG and ALP mRNA levels were significantly increased to varying degrees after Sr treatment, and the osteoclast markers RANKL and TRAP were accompanied by varying degrees of reduction. These experimental results show that Sr improves bones from multiple angles. Further investigation of the microbial population revealed that the composition of the gut microbiome was changed due to Sr, with the abundance of 6 of the bacteria showing a different dose dependence with Sr concentration than the control group. To investigate whether alterations in bacterial flora were responsible for the effects of Sr on bone remodeling, a further pearson correlation analysis was done, 4 types of bacteria (Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Alistipes and Weissella) were deduced to be the primary contributors to Sr-relieved bone loss. Of these, we focused our analysis on the most firmly associated Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014. DISCUSSION: To summarize, our current research explores changes in bone mass following Sr intervention in young individuals, and the connection between Sr-altered intestinal flora and potentially beneficial bacteria in the attenuation of bone loss. These discoveries underscore the importance of the \"gut-bone\" axis, contributing to an understanding of how Sr affects bone quality, and providing a fresh idea for bone mass accumulation in young individuals and thereby preventing disease due to acquired bone mass deficiency.",

While intra-articular injections are effective for the local administration of drugs, small molecules are rapidly cleared from the synovial fluid. As such, there is a need to develop effective drug delivery strategies to improve the residence times of bioactive molecules in the joint and elicit a sustained therapeutic effect. In this study, calcium- and strontium-polyphosphate particles are synthesized and characterized as potential drug carriers into articular cartilage. Physicochemical characterization reveals that the particles exhibit a spherical morphology, have a negative zeta potential, and are nanoscale in size. Biological characterization in chondrocytes confirms cellular uptake of the particles and demonstrates both size and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity at high concentrations. Furthermore, treatment of chondrocytes with these particles results in a reduction in cell proliferation and metabolic activity, confirming biological effects. Finally, incubation with cartilage tissue explants suggests successful uptake, despite the particles exhibiting a negative surface charge. Therefore, from the results of this study, these polyphosphate-based particles have potential as a drug carrier into articular cartilage and warrant further development.",

METHODS: CSR was synthesized by sol-gel process and incorporated in 5 % NaF varnish at three different concentrations (1 %, 2 %, and 4 % w/v). The treatment/control groups were: 1 % CSR+NaF, 2 % CSR+NaF, 4 % CSR+NaF, NaF, and no treatment. Strontium and fluoride release from the varnishes was evaluated. Sound enamel specimens (n = 6) were demineralized, varnish-treated, and subjected to remineralization cycle. Mineral density of enamel specimens was evaluated using micro-CT. Antimicrobial effect of the varnishes on Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus biofilms was assessed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The HGF-1 cytotoxicity of the varnishes was examined using CCK-8 assay. RESULTS: Both 2 % and 4 % CSR+NaF varnishes showed significantly higher F release and remineralization potential than NaF varnish (p < 0.05). Dead bacterial proportion of 4 % CSR+NaF varnish was significantly higher than NaF varnish (p < 0.05). The CFUs values of both S. mutans and L. acidophilus were significantly lower in 4 % CSR+NaF group than NaF group (p < 0.05). No significant difference in cell viability was observed among the groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of 4 % CSR in a NaF varnish significantly enhanced its enamel remineralization and antimicrobial potential with no cytotoxic effect. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dental caries is a major public health problem globally. The study highlights the great potential of CSR-doped NaF varnish as a novel anti-caries agent with synergistic remineralizing and antimicrobial properties to combat early enamel caries lesions in the general population.",

A conversion coating of strontium phosphate (Sr-P) on the surface of titanium (Ti) can improve its biological properties and has many potential applications in the fields of dentistry and orthopedics. In the present study, Sr-P coatings with SrHPO4 and Sr3(PO4)2 crystals on Ti are prepared by a phosphate chemical conversion (PCC) treatment and the effect of pH values on the properties of the Sr-P coatings is researched. The results prove that the phase composition, morphology, and corrosion resistance of the coated Ti vary according to the pH values of the PCC solution. The morphology of the conversion deposition on Ti changes from plat-like to cluster-like and then to homogeneous microcrystals as the pH value changes from 2.50 to 3.25. Only discrete SrHPO4 crystals are generated on the substrate at lower pH values, while relatively stable Sr3(PO4)2 and SrHPO4 crystals grow and subsequently form an integrated coating on the Ti as the pH exceeds 2.50. The cross-sectional morphologies and bonding strength of different coatings are also researched. The corrosion resistance of coated Ti improves compared with that of bare Ti because of the Sr-P coatings with a Sr3(PO4)2 phase. In addition, it is indicated that the Sr-P coatings on Ti can improve the adhesion and differentiation of BMSCs."

      "abstract": "Strontium (Sr) is an essential trace element in the human body and plays an important role in regulating male reproductive health. Recent studies have shown that gut flora plays a key role in maintaining spermatogenesis, as well as testicular health, through the gut-testis axis. At present, it is unclear whether gut microbiota can mediate the effects of Sr on sperm quality, and what the underlying mechanisms may be. We investigated the effects of different concentrations of strontium chloride (SrCl2) solutions (0, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg BW) on reproductive function and gut microbiota in male Wistar rats (6-8 weeks, 250 ± 20 g). All the animals were euthanized after 37 days of treatment. The Sr-50 group significantly increased sperm concentration, sperm motility, and sperm viability in rats. After Sr treatment, serum and testicular testosterone (T) and Sr levels increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing Sr concentration. At the same time, we also found that testicular marker enzymes (ACP, LDH) and testosterone marker genes (StAR, 3β-HSD, and Cyp11a1) increased significantly in varying degrees after Sr treatment, while serum NO levels decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigation of intestinal flora showed that SrCl2 affected the composition of gut microbiome, but did not affect the richness and diversity of gut microbiota. Sr treatment reduced the number of bacteria with negative effects on reproductive health, such as Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes, Romboutsia, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_014, Weissella, and Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group, and added bacteria with negative effects on reproductive health, such as Jeotgalicoccus. To further explore the Sr and the relationship between the gut microbiota, we conducted a Spearman correlation analysis, and the results showed that the gut microbiota was closely correlated with Sr content in serum and testicular tissue, sex hormone levels, and testicular marker enzymes. Additionally, gut microbiota can also regulate each other and jointly maintain the homeostasis of the body's internal environment. However, we found no significant correlation between intestinal flora and sperm quality in this study, which may be related to the small sample size of our 16S rDNA sequencing. In conclusion, the Sr-50 group significantly increased T levels and sperm quality, and improved the levels of testicular marker enzymes and testosterone marker genes in the rats. Sr treatment altered the gut flora of the rats. However, further analysis of the effects of gut microbiota in mediating the effects of SrCl2 on male reproductive function is needed. This study may improve the current understanding of the interaction between Sr, reproductive health, and gut microbiota, providing evidence for the development of Sr-rich foods and the prevention of male fertility decline."

Publications from 2012 to 2022 were included based on the patient/population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) framework, focusing on demineralized enamel treated with strontium-doped nanohydroxyapatite compared to other remineralizing agents, with the primary outcome being remineralization capacity. Electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, were explored from March 31, 2023, to April 10, 2023. Only English language studies were included, while certain research types and studies on bovine teeth were excluded. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane methodology. Five studies were synthesized, all using extracted human maxillary premolars. Four studies focused on remineralizing enamel, while one study focused on remineralizing dentin. Among these studies, comparisons were made between different strontium concentrations and various remineralizing agents such as nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP), Acclaim, casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP), and NovaMin. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to examine hydroxyapatite formation, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for characterization. Additionally, one study evaluated the mechanical properties of partially demineralized dentin specimens. This study was registered in the PROSPERO under the ID CRD42023397413 and completed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines."

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) contamination of rice is an urgent ecological and agricultural problem. Strontium (Sr) has been shown to promote plant growth. However, the effect of Sr on rice seedlings under Cd stress is currently unclear. In this work hydroponic experiments were used to assess the impact of Sr on rice seedling growth under Cd stress. The findings demonstrated that foliar application of 0.5 mg L-1 Sr had no discernible impact on the development of rice seedlings. However, Sr significantly alleviated growth inhibition and toxicity in rice seedlings when threatened by Cd. Compared with the Cd treatment (Cd, 2.5 mg L-1), the root length, shoot height, and whole plant length of rice seedlings in the Cd + Sr treatment (Cd, 2.5 mg L-1; Sr, 0.5 mg L-1) increased by 4.96 %, 12.47 % and 9.60 %, respectively. The content of Cd in rice decreased by 23.34 % (roots) and 5.79 % (shoots). Sr lessened the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation damage (lower MDA concentration) among the seedlings of rice under Cd stress by controlling the activities of antioxidant enzymes and GSH content. By changing the expression of antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes and downregulating the heavy metal transporter gene (OsNramp5), Sr reduced accumulation and the detrimental effects of Cd on rice seedlings. Our study provides a new solution to the problem of Cd contamination in rice, which may promote the safe production of rice and benefit human health.",

METHODS: Establishment of mouse model of high blood pressure by drinking 2 mg/mL N'nitro-L-arginine methyl eater hydrochloride(L-NAME) for 4 weeks. One hundred ICR mice were randomly divided into normal control group(n=20) and model group(n=80) according to systolic blood pressure. Eighty hypertensive mice were randomly divided into model control group(n=20), 2.5 mg/L strontium water group(n=20), 5.0 mg/L strontium water group(n=20) and 10.0 mg/L strontium water group(n=20). The body weight and blood pressure of mice were measured every week. After 10 weeks, serum sodium(Na), potassium(K), calcium(Ca), magnesium(Mg), Chlorine(Cl), nitric oxide(NO), renin, angiotensin II(Ang II), aldosterone(ALD), endothelial nitric oxide synthase(eNOS), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1), heart interleukin-6(IL-6), interleukin-1 beta(IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) were determined. RESULTS: After 10 weeks of intervention, the systolic blood pressure in the low, medium and high strontium water groups(129.60±4.90 mmHg vs.127.33±6.35 mmHg vs.124.70±3.91 mmHg) was significantly lower than that of the model control group(141.84±5.34 mmHg)(P&lt;0.05). The diastolic blood pressure in the high strontium water group(84.74±5.49 mmHg) was significantly lower than that of the model control group(92.21±10.08 mmHg). The contents of serum potassium, calcium and magnesium in medium strontium gourp(8.06±0.80 mmol/L vs.2.34±0.13 mmol/L vs.0.57±0.12 mmol/L) and high strontium group(9.59±0.58 mmol/L vs. 2.37±0.17 mmol/L vs.0.58±0.09 mmol/L) were significantly higher than those in normal control group(6.64±0.57 mmol/L vs.2.07±0.15 mmol/L vs.0.46±0.10 mmol/L) and model control group(6.62±0.53 mmol/L vs.2.09±0.11 mmol/L vs.0.48±0.09 mmol/L)(P&lt;0.05).

      "abstract": "Ni-rich layered structure ternary oxides, such as LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811), are promising cathode materials for high-energy lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, a trade-off between high capacity and long cycle life still obstructs the commercialization of Ni-rich cathodes in modern LIBs. Herein, a facile dual modification approach for improving the electrochemical performance of NCM811 was enabled by a typical perovskite oxide: strontium titanate (SrTiO3). With a suitable thermal treatment, the modified cathode exhibited an outstanding electrochemical performance that could deliver a high discharge capacity of 188.5 mAh/g after 200 cycles under 1C with a capacity retention of 90%. The SrTiO3 (STO) protective layer can effectively suppress the side reaction between the NCM811 and the electrolyte. In the meantime, the pillar effect provided by interfacial Ti doping could effectively reduce the Li+/Ni2+ mixing ratio on the NCM811 surface and offer more efficient Li+ migration between the cathode and the coating layer after post-thermal treatment (≥600 °C). This dual modification strategy not only significantly improves the structural stability of Ni-rich layered structure but also enhances the electrochemical kinetics via increasing diffusion rate of Li+. The electrochemical measurement results further disclosed that the 3 wt% STO coated NCM811 with 600 °C annealing exhibits the best performance compared with other control samples, suggesting an appropriate temperature range for STO coated NCM811 cathode is critical for maintaining a stable structure for the whole system. This work may offer an effective option to enhance the electrochemical performance of Ni-rich cathodes for high-performance LIBs."

As an important trace element, strontium (Sr) has been reported to have antioxidant effects, to have anti-inflammatory effects, and to cause the inhibition of adipogenesis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the protective effects of Sr on hippocampal damage in NAFLD mice in order to elucidate the underlying mechanism of Sr in NAFLD. The mouse model of NAFLD was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD), and the mice were treated with Sr. In the NAFLD mice, we found that treatment with Sr significantly increased the density of c-Fos+ cells in the hippocampus and inhibited the expression of caspase-3 by suppressing ERS. Surprisingly, the induction of neuroinflammation and the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus following an HFD were attenuated by Sr treatment. Sr significantly attenuated the activation of microglia and astrocytes induced by an HFD. The expression of phospho-p38, ERK, and NF-κB was consistently significantly increased in the HFD group, and treatment with Sr decreased their expression. Moreover, Sr prevented HFD-induced damage to the ultra-structural synaptic architecture. This study implies that Sr has beneficial effects on repairing the damage to the hippocampus induced by an HFD, revealing that Sr could be a potential candidate for protection from neural damage caused by NAFLD.",

Despite the information accumulated on the role of Sr2+ as a Ca2+ mimetic in biology and medicine, there is no systematic study of how the outcome of the competition between the two dications depends on the physicochemical properties of (i) the metal ions, (ii) the first- and second-shell ligands, and (iii) the protein matrix. Specifically, the key features of a Ca2+-binding protein that enable Sr2+ to displace Ca2+ remain unclear. To address this, we studied the competition between Ca2+ and Sr2+ in protein Ca2+-binding sites using density functional theory combined with the polarizable continuum model. Our findings indicate that Ca2+-sites with multiple strong charge-donating protein ligands, including one or more bidentately bound Asp-/Glu- that are relatively buried and rigid are protected against Sr2+ attack. On the other hand, Ca2+-sites crowded with multiple protein ligands may be prone to Sr2+ displacement if they are solvent-exposed and flexible enough so that an extra backbone ligand from the outer shell can bind to Sr2+. In addition, solvent-exposed Ca2+ sites with only a few weak charge-donating ligands that can rearrange to fit the strontium's coordination requirements are susceptible to Sr2+ displacement. We provide the physical basis of these results and discuss potential novel protein targets of therapeutic Sr2+.",

Sagittal vateritization is believed to impair individual hearing/balancing abilities, but the causal mechanism remains unclear. Here we experimentally demonstrated that rearing in Sr-rich water induces sagittal vateritization in the HdrR-II1 inbred strain of the Japanese rice fish, Oryzias latipes. Both sagittae were partly vateritized in 70% of individuals subjected to the Sr2+ treatment (n = 10), whereas fish reared in normal tap water showed no sagittal vateritization (n = 8). Our result is consistent with the theoretical prediction that vaterite becomes thermodynamically more stable than aragonite as the Sr2+ concentration in solution increases. A vateritic layer develops surrounding the original aragonitic sagitta in vateritized otoliths, some of which take on a comma-like shape. Electron probe microanalysis demonstrates that the vateritized phase is characterized by lower Sr2+ and higher Mg2+ concentrations than the aragonitic phase. It is unlikely that increased environmental Sr2+ is responsible for the sagittal vateritization in farmed fish. However, our findings likely help to establish an in vivo assay using O. latipes to understand the physiological process underlying the sagittal vateritization in farmed fish."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the modern broiler industry, leg and gait disorders are considerable problems. Fast-growing broilers are especially susceptible to bone abnormalities, causing major problems for broiler producers. Strontium ranelate (SrR) has been used successfully for the treatment of osteoporosis in humans. In addition, cerium oxide (CeO) is an anti-stress agent applied in the biological system. METHODS: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of SrR, CeO, and their combinations on tibia quality in broilers. A total of 384 one-day-old Ross chicks were divided into six treatments, with four replicates per treatment (16 birds per replicate). The control group was fed a standard diet, and other groups were fed SrR at levels 450, 900 mg/kg feed, CeO at levels 300 and 600 mg/kg feed and a combination of 450 SrR + 300 CeO mg/kg feed. Bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), bone strength (BS), tibia area, tibia weight, bone Length, bone diameter, minerals in tibia bone of male broilers, alkaline phosphatase gene (ALP) and osteocalcin gene (OC) in male broilers were analysed. RESULTS: The results showed that the addition of SrR and CeO had no significant influence (p > 0.01) on BMD, BMC, BS, bone weight, bone length and bone diameter. While there was a significant interaction between sex and treatments, especially in the combination group, BS in females significantly (p < 0.01) increased compared to the control group. Generally, females were found to be more responsive to treatments than males. Significant increases in gene expression were noticed in OC with the addition of low levels of SrR and CeO and mixed group compared to the control. The gene expression of ALP was increased significantly only in a combination group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that SrR and CeO can be used as beneficial additives in the feed to improve the tibia quality of broilers.",

Sr level can serve as an index of rumen Ca absorption capacity; however, the effects of Sr on Ca2+ metabolism are unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of Sr on Ca2+ metabolism in bovine rumen epithelial cells. The bovine rumen epithelial cells were isolated from the rumen of newborn Holstein male calves (n = 3, 1 day old, 38.0 ± 2.8 kg, fasting). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Sr-treated bovine rumen epithelial cells and cell cycle were used to establish the Sr treatment model. Transcriptomics, proteomics, and network pharmacology were conducted to investigate the core targets of Sr-mediated regulation of Ca2+ metabolism in bovine rumen epithelial cells. The data of transcriptomics and proteomics were analyzed using bioinformatic analysis (Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes/protein). Quantitative data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 and the Shapiro-Wilk test was used for the normality test. Results presented that the IC50 of Sr treatment bovine rumen epithelial cells for 24 h was 43.21 mmol/L, and Sr increased intracellular Ca2+ levels. Multi-omics results demonstrated the differential expression of 770 mRNAs and 2436 proteins after Sr treatment; network pharmacology and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like protein 2 (AHCYL2), Semaphoring 3A (SEMA3A), Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHLH), Transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2), and Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) as potential targets for Sr-mediated Ca2+ metabolism regulation. Together these results will improve the current comprehension of the regulatory effect of Sr on Ca2+ metabolism and pave a theoretical basis for Sr application in bovine hypocalcemia.",

      "abstract": "The efficient use of visible light is necessary to take advantage of photocatalytic processes in both indoor and outdoor circumstances. Precisely manipulating the in situ growth method of heterojunctions is an effective way to promote photogenerated charge separation. Herein, the SrFeO3@B-rGO catalyst was prepared by an in situ growth method. At a loading of 10 wt % B-rGO, the nanocomposites revealed an excellent morphology and thermal, optical, electrochemical, and mechanical properties. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the cubic spinel structure and a space group of Pm̅3m for SrFeO3. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy show the core-shell formation between SrFeO3 and B-rGO. Furthermore, density functional theory of SrFeO3 was performed to find its band structure and density of states. The SrFeO3@B-rGO nanocomposite shows the degradation rate of tetracycline (TC) reaching 92% in 75 min and the highest rate constant of 0.0211 min-1. To improve the catalytic removal rate of antibiotics, the efficiency of e- and h + separation must be improved, as well as the generation of additional radicals. Radical trapping tests and the electron paramagnetic resonance method indicated that the combination of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in SrFeO3 effectively separated e- and h+ while also promoting the development of the superoxide anion (•O2-) to accelerate TC degradation. The entire TC degradation pathway using high-performance liquid chromatography and its mechanism were discussed. As a whole, this study delineates that photocatalysis is a viable strategy for the treatment of environmental antibiotic wastewater."

In the present work, the capacity of thermally treated natural zeolite (NZ) from Macicasu (Romania) to remove Cs+ and Sr2+ ions from aqueous solutions in batch mode was investigated by contacting different zeolite quantities (0.5, 1, and 2 g) of 0.5-1.25 mm (NZ1) and 0.1-0.5 mm (NZ2) particle size fractions with 50 mL working solutions of Cs+ and Sr2+ (10, 50, and 100 mg L-1 initial concentrations) for 180 min. The concentration of Cs in the aqueous solutions was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), whereas the Sr concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The removal efficiency of Cs+ varied between 62.8 and 99.3%, whereas Sr2+ ranged between 51.3 and 94.5%, depending on the initial concentrations, the contact time, the amount, and particle size of the adsorbent material. The sorption of Cs+ and Sr2+ was analyzed using the nonlinear form of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models and pseudo-first-order (PFO) and pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic models. The results indicated that the sorption kinetics of Cs+ and Sr2+ on thermally treated natural zeolite was described by the PSO kinetic model. Chemisorption dominates the retention of both Cs+ and Sr2+ by strong coordinate bonds with an aluminosilicate zeolite skeleton."

Under optimal conditions, the algae's biosorption capacity for strontium (initial pH 7.2, initial strontium concentration 300 mg/l for Mg-treated biomass and biosorbent dosage 0.1 g in 100 mL metal solution) was measured at 103.95 mg/g. In our analysis, equilibrium data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Results show that the best fit is provided by the Freundlich model.

However, little attention has been paid to the effect of SR on alveolar bone remodeling during orthodontic tooth movement and its underlying mechanism. Here, we investigated the influence of SR on orthodontic tooth movement and tooth resorption in Sprague-Dawley rats and the relationship between the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, autophagy, and osteoclastogenesis after the administration of SR in vitro and in vivo. In this study, it was found that SR reduced the expression of autophagy-related proteins at the pressure side of the first molars during orthodontic tooth movement. Similarly, the expression of these autophagy-related proteins and the size and number of autophagosomes were downregulated by SR in vitro. The results also showed that SR reduced the number of osteoclasts and suppressed orthodontic tooth movement and root resorption in rats, which could be partially restored using rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. Autophagy was attenuated after pre-osteoclasts were treated with Bay 11-7082, an NF-κB pathway inhibitor, while SR reduced the expression of the proteins central to the NF-κB pathway. Collectively, this study revealed that SR might suppress osteoclastogenesis through NF-κB-pathway-dependent autophagy, resulting in the inhibition of orthodontic tooth movement and root resorption in rats, which might offer a new insight into the treatment of malocclusion and bone metabolic diseases."

In this work, we organically granulated zirconium phosphate to induce the formation of composite bead materials (CA@ZrP) with a calcium-containing phase with selectivity for Sr2+ and Cs+ higher than that of pure ZrP in low-pH environments and competing ionic environments. The adsorption performance of the material was systematically investigated. It was concluded that the adsorption performance of CA@ZrP improved with an increase in temperature, and under the dynamic adsorption experimental conditions, the treatment capacity of CA@ZrP for Sr2+ and Cs+ reached 404.79 and 302.2 bed volumes, respectively. The systematic study and characterization showed that the generation of the calcium-containing phase [Ca0.55ZrH0.9(PO4)2] promoted the exchange of Ca2+ with Sr2+ and Cs+, thus improving the selectivity of the composite beads. The highly selective composite bead material can be prepared in batches and easily recycled, providing a new idea for practical engineering applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Titanium (Ti) is now widely used as implant material due to its excellent mechanical properties and superior biocompatibilities, while its inert bioactivities might lead to insufficient osseointegration, and limit its performance in dental applications. METHODS: We introduced a robust and simple approach of modifying titanium surfaces with polysaccharide complexes. Titanium samples were subjected to hydrothermal treatment to create a uniform porous structure on the surface, followed by coating with a bioinspired and self-assembly polydopamine layer. Strontium Eucommia Ulmoides Polysaccharide (EUP-Sr) complexes are then introduced to the polydopamine-coated porous titanium. Multiple morphological and physiochemical characterizations are employed for material evaluation, while cell proliferation and gene expression tests using macrophages, primary alveolar bone osteoblasts, and vascular endothelial cells are used to provide an overall insight into the functions of the product. The significances of statistical differences were analyzed using student's t-test. RESULTS: Microscopic and spectrometric characterizations confirmed that the Ti surface formed a porous structure with an adequate amount of EUP-Sr loading. The attachment was attributed to hydrogen bonding between the ubiquitous glycosidic linkage of the polysaccharide complex and the ring structure of polydopamine, yet the loaded EUP-Sr complex can be gradually released, consequently benefiting the neighboring microenvironment. Cell experiments showed no cytotoxicity of the material, and the product showed promising anti-inflammation, osseointegration, and angiogenesis properties, which were further confirmed by in vivo evaluations. CONCLUSION: We believe the EUP-Sr modified titanium implant is a promising candidate to be used in dental applications with notable osteoimmunomodulation and angiogenesis functions. And the novel technique proposed in this study would benefit the modification of metal/inorganic surfaces with polysaccharides for future research."

The different resulting photocatalytic systems were then first deeply characterized by means of N2 adsorption-desorption measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance (UV-vis DR), Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and Z-mapping). In a second step, optimization of the kinetic response of the Sr-containing composites was performed for the formic acid photodegradation under UV irradiation. The Sr-containing Cu/GO/TiNT composites were then fully characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for their dielectric properties showing clearly the implication of polarization induced by the Sr addition onto the stabilization of photogenerated charges. Finally, a perfect correlation between the photocatalytic kinetic evaluation and dielectric properties undoubtedly emphasizes the role of ferroelectric polarization as a very valuable approach to enhance the photocatalytic properties in an adjacent semiconductor."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Titanium implants are regarded as a promising treatment modality for replacing missing teeth. Osteointegration and antibacterial properties are both desirable characteristics for titanium dental implants. The aim of this study was to create zinc (Zn)-, strontium (Sr)-, and magnesium (Mg)-multidoped hydroxyapatite (HAp) porous coatings, including HAp, Zn-doped HAp, and Zn-Sr-Mg-doped HAp, on titanium discs and implants using the vapor-induced pore-forming atmospheric plasma spraying (VIPF-APS) technique. METHODS: The mRNA and protein levels of osteogenesis-associated genes such as collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), decorin (DCN), osteoprotegerin (TNFRSF11B), and osteopontin (SPP1) were examined in human embryonic palatal mesenchymal cells. The antibacterial effects against periodontal bacteria, including Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella nigrescens, were investigated. In addition, a rat animal model was used to evaluate new bone formation via histologic examination and micro-computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: The ZnSrMg-HAp group was the most effective at inducing mRNA and protein expression of TNFRSF11B and SPP1 after 7 days of incubation, and TNFRSF11B and DCN after 11 days of incubation. In addition, both the ZnSrMg-HAp and Zn-HAp groups were effective against P. gingivalis and P. nigrescens. Furthermore, according to both in vitro studies and histologic findings, the ZnSrMg-HAp group exhibited the most prominent osteogenesis and concentrated bone growth along implant threads. SIGNIFICANCE: A porous ZnSrMg-HAp coating using VIPF-APS could serve as a novel technique for coating titanium implant surfaces and preventing further bacterial infection.",

Strontium has important biological functions in bone and has been used as a therapeutic agent for treating diseases that result in bone defects, such as osteoporosis. Here, we developed a strategy to mineralize collagen with Sr-doped hydroxyapatite (HA) using the PILP process. Doping with Sr altered the crystal lattice of HA and inhibited the degree of mineralization in a concentration-dependent manner, but did not affect the unique formation of intrafibrillar minerals using the PILP. The Sr-doped HA nanocrystals were aligned in the [001] direction but did not recapitulate the parallel alignment of the c-axis of pure Ca HA in relation to the collagen fiber long axis. The mimicry of doping Sr in PILP-mineralized collagen can help understand the doping of Sr in natural hard tissues and during treatment. The fibrillary mineralized collagen with Sr-doped HA will be explored in future work as biomimetic and bioactive scaffolds for regeneration of bone and tooth dentin.",

The incidence of AKI after cardiac surgeries using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB-AKI) is high, emphasizing the need to determine strategies to prevent CPB-AKI. This study investigates the correlation between CPB-AKI and trace metal levels in clinical and animal studies. METHODS: Samples and clinical data were obtained from 74 patients from the Nagoya City University Hospital and Okazaki City Hospital. Blood samples were collected before, immediately after, and 2 h after CPB withdrawal. Trace metal levels were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Sr or vehicle treatment was orally administered to the rats to determine if Sr was associated with CPB-AKI. After the treatment, ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury was induced, and serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured. RESULTS: In this clinical study, the incidence of CPB-AKI was found to be 28% (21/74). The body mass index and estimated glomerular filtration rate were significantly different in patients with AKI. The intensive care unit and hospital stay were longer in AKI patients than in non-AKI patients. The Na, Fe, and Sr levels were significantly higher in AKI patients before CPB. Also, Fe and Sr were higher immediately after CPB withdrawal, and Sr was higher 2 h after CPB withdrawal in AKI patients. Animal studies showed that Sr-treated rats had significantly increased SCr and BUN levels than vehicle-treated rats at 24 h post-IR injury. CONCLUSIONS: High preoperative serum Sr levels may be associated with CPB-AKI.",

Such features make CPCs also interesting for functionalization with various biomolecules, towards the generation of multifunctional devices with enhanced therapeutic ability. In particular, strontium-doped CPCs have been studied in the last years due to the intrinsic antiosteoporotic character of strontium. In this work, a SrCPC previously reported as osteointegrative and capable to modulate the fate of bone cells was enriched with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HA-NPs) functionalized with tetracycline (TC) to provide antibacterial activity. We found that HA-NPs functionalized with TC (NP-TC) can act as modulator of the drug release profile when embedded in SrCPCs, thus providing a sustained and tunable TC release. In vitro microbiological tests on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus strains proved effective bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties, especially for the NP-TC loaded SrCPC formulations. Overall, our results indicate that the addition of NP-TC on CPC acted as effective modulator towards a tunable drug release control in the treatment of bone infections or cancers."
