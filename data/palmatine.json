      "abstract": "Palmatine (PAL), as an active ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, had been demonstrated efficacy in ameliorating the manifestations of AD. Our research group has previously designed and synthesized the novel oxo-PAL derivative 2q and found that it has exhibited notable neuroprotective properties. However, compound 2q therapeutic impact on AD remains uncertain. In the current investigation, our findings demonstrated that compound 2q displayed significant anti-AβOs activity in vitro by using xCELLigence analysis, and showed a high likelihood of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, administration of compound 2q yielded a notable amelioration in Aβ accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in 3×Tg mice. Additionally, it was observed that compound 2q potentially enhanced the pathological characteristics of AD by targeting Potassium/Sodium Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channel 2 (HCN2). In conclusion, compound 2q emerged as a promising candidate for AD treatment, as it effectively restored AD-associated pathological impairments. Furthermore, it has been identified as a potential target of HCN2, thereby offering novel avenues for the development of treatments for AD.",

      "abstract": "Palmatine (PAL) and berberine are both classified as protoberberine alkaloids, derived from several traditional Chinese herbs such as Coptis chinensis Franch. and Phellodendron chinense Schneid. These compounds are extensively used in treating dysentery and colitis. PAL is one of the crucial quality markers for these plants in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. A key metabolite of PAL, 8-Oxypalmatine (OPAL), shows favorable anti-inflammatory activity and better safety compared to PAL, though its mechanisms in ulcerative colitis (UC) are not fully understood. This study used a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mouse model to explore OPAL's effects. The results indicated that OPAL provided superior therapeutic effects to those of PAL, alleviating colitis symptoms and reducing colon inflammation by modulating pro-inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6) and anti-inflammatory (transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-10) cytokines. Additionally, OPAL helped rebuild the mucus barrier and upregulated tight junction proteins, thereby restoring intestinal integrity. Notably, OPAL inhibited the M1 macrophages infiltration while promoting M2 macrophage distribution in the colon. Its role in fostering M2 polarization and modulating the inflammatory cytokine profile was further confirmed in vitro. Importantly, the anti-inflammatory effects were primarily linked to AMP-activated protein kinase activation, which subsequently inhibited the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway. These findings highlight OPAL as a crucial active metabolite responsible for the therapeutic effects of PAL against UC, emphasizing its potential as a novel treatment for this condition.",

      "abstract": "The mitotic kinase Aurora kinase A (AURKA), which plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression, represents a promising target for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we found that AURKA is a target of a CRC suppressor, the Palmatine (PAL). However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This work aims to investigate the underlying mechanism how PAL suppresses CRC through AURKA. It was confirmed that AURKA played an important role in the development of CRC tumors through an Azoxymethane/Dextran sulfate sodium salt induced mice model and tissue microarrays of CRC-patients. Overexpression of AURKA was able to partially reverse the inhibitory effect of PAL on CRC cells, showing that PAL significantly inhibited the malignant phenotype and induced the G2/M phase arrest of CRC cells by down-regulating AURKA. Functional studies indicated that PAL attenuated the stability of AURKA protein and reduced its nuclear level, resulting in reduction of key proteins in the G2/M phase. Importantly, Co-IP and WB experiments suggested that Myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) interacted with AURKA and had an impact on its nuclear localization. PAL can decrease nuclear AURKA by reducing the interaction of AURKA and MYH9. Taken together, our study revealed that MYH9 as an auxiliary protein for the nuclear localization of AURKA and elucidated the mechanism that PAL reduced nuclear AURKA through inhibiting the interaction of AURKA and MYH9 to induce G2/M phase arrest in CRC cells. Therefore, this study may provide a theoretical basis of PAL for the treatment of CRC.",

      "abstract": "UC, also known as ulcerative colitis, is an inflammatory bowel disease that is chronic and nonspecific. Palmatine (PAL), a natural alkaloid active ingredient, has demonstrated predominant protective effects on UC. In spite of this, PAL on UC is unclear in terms of its underlying mechanisms. Thus, this study aimed to investigate its effects and mechanism. By inducing rats with 5 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), an in vivo model of UC was developed. and then oral PAL administration. In vitro viability of NCM460 cells was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the levels of inflammatory factores. The levels of oxidative stress parameters were also assessed, and the expression level of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), NF-E2-related factor 2(Nrf2), phospho-Nrf2, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was detected by Western blot. An iron kit was employed to measure iron content in cells and colonic tissues. Results indicated that PAL treatment significantly improved UC in rats, as shown by reduced disease activity index scores and increased colon length, which decreased IL-18, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, NO, and LDH levels, but increased GSH level in DSS-induced rats and NCM460 cells. Further, PAL treatment markedly decreased COX-2, ACSL4, Nrf2, and HO-1 expression levels while increasing that of GPX4 and phospho-Nrf2. Furthermore, PAL inhibited the iron overload in the cells and colonic tissues. PAL may protect against UC by inhibiting the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, iron load, and suppressing ferroptosis pathway.",

The fact that singlet oxygen activation in palmatine may be triggered by environmental conditions, and in particular its interaction with nucleic acids, makes it a most suitable candidate for photodynamic therapy and DNA-targeted noninvasive anticancer strategies. Despite these remarkable properties, the actual binding mode between palmatine and DNA has not been resolved, yet. Its elucidation has indeed led to contrasting hypotheses. In this contribution, by using long-range molecular dynamic simulations and enhanced sampling approaches, we unequivocally identify that intercalation is the dominant binding mode of palmatine with DNA, from both a thermodynamic and kinetic point of view.",

      "abstract": "Berberine and palmatine are isoquinoline quaternary alkaloids derived from Chinese medicinal herbs. These alkaloids have shown promising synergy in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), indicating their potential in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides, the anti-inflammatory effects of berberine and palmatine have been widely reported, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we found that berberine and palmatine could induce calcium ion (Ca2+) influx via activating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) in cultured microglial cells, possibly serving as its allosteric potential ligands. Furthermore, we examined the synergistic anti-inflammatory effects of berberine and palmatine in the LPS-induced microglia, that significantly suppressed the production of TNF-α and iNOS. Notably, this suppression was reversed by co-treatment with a selective antagonist of α7 nAChR. Moreover, the alkaloid-induced microglial phagocytosis was shown to be mediated by the induction of Ca2+ influx through α7 nAChR and subsequent CaMKII-Rac1-dependent pathway. Additionally, the combination of berberine and palmatine, at low concentration, protected against the LPS-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia. These findings indicate the potential of berberine and palmatine, either individually or in combination, in contributing to anti-AD drug development, which provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which natural products, such as plant alkaloids, exert their anti-AD effects.",

      "abstract": "Micropterus salmoides rhabdovirus (MSRV) poses a significant threat to aquaculture, causing substantial economic losses. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy and immunomodulatory potential of palmatine, a plant-derived monomer, against MSRV infection in largemouth bass. Our results demonstrated that palmatine significantly inhibited MSRV replication, with a reduction in viral nucleoprotein expression by 85 % at a safe concentration. Additionally, palmatine pre-treatment of EPC cells enhanced their antiviral capacity, with a maximum inhibition rate of 82 % following 24 h pre-incubation. Palmatine also effectively reduced MSRV-induced cytopathic effects, protecting cellular integrity and maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential. In vivo studies revealed that palmatine immersion at 80 mg/L was non-toxic and significantly suppressed MSRV replication in largemouth bass, increasing survival rates by 53 % over 15 d. Furthermore, palmatine pre-treatment enhanced the fish's resistance to MSRV, with a 78 % inhibition rate of viral replication and a 46 % increase in survival rate. Mechanistically, palmatine activated key immune genes, including IRF3, IRF7, and IFN, indicating its role in boosting innate immune responses. The compound also reduced horizontal transmission of MSRV in a cohabitation model, decreasing viral spread by up to 78 % over nine days. These findings highlight palmatine's potential as a small-molecule immunomodulator in aquaculture, offering a sustainable approach to disease management and enhancing fish health and welfare. Integrating palmatine into fish diets as an immunostimulant could provide a continuous, proactive defense against viral outbreaks, promoting more resilient and sustainable aquaculture practices.",

      "abstract": "Aristolochic acid (AA) is renowned for engendering nephrotoxicity and teratogenicity. Previous literature has reported that AA treatment resulted in heart failure (HF) via inflammatory pathways. Yet, its implications in HF remain comparatively uncharted territory, particularly with respect to underlying mechanisms. In our study, the zebrafish model was employed to delineate the cardiotoxicity of AA exposure and the restorative capacity of a phytogenic alkaloid palmatine (PAL). PAL restored morphology and blood supply in AA-damaged hearts by o-dianisidine staining, fluorescence imaging, and Hematoxylin and Eosin staining. Furthermore, PAL attenuated the detrimental effects of AA on ATPase activity, implying myocardial energy metabolism recovery. PAL decreased the co-localization of neutrophils with cardiomyocytes, implying an attenuation of the inflammatory response induced by AA. A combination of network pharmacological analysis and qPCR validation shed light on the therapeutic mechanism of PAL against AA-induced heart failure via upregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. Subsequent evaluations using a transcriptological testing, inhibitor model, and molecular docking assay corroborated PAL as an IKBKB enzyme activator. The study underscores the possible exploitation of the EGFR pathway as a potential therapeutic target for PAL against AA-induced HF, thus furthering the continued investigation of the toxicology and advancement of protective pharmaceuticals for AA.",

The natural bioactive isoquinoline alkaloid palmatine (PAL), which is extracted from one of the herbs (Coptis chinensis) of the anti-AS formular, is of particular interest due to its pharmacological properties. ApoE-/- mice were administered PAL or vehicle; plaque areas, and stability were assessed by histopathological and immunohistochemistry analysis, serum glycolysis and lipid levels, and inflammation levels were also evaluated. 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics analysis were employed to evaluate microbial composition and serum metabolites. Microbial culture experiments were designed to reveal the target microbiota and associated metabolites. Cell culture and transcriptome were performed to elucidate the function of microbial metabolites on THP-1. PAL reduced the area of plaque and necrotic core, improving inflammatory infiltration within plaques, improving glycolipid metabolism, and reducing the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. PAL treatment reshaped the composition of the gut microbiota, especially, reducing the relative abundance of Desulfovibrio piger (D. piger) in a dose-dependent manner and serum level of hippuric acid (HA). D. piger was able to convert phenylalanine into 3-phenylpropionic acid (precursor of HA). Finally, we verified HA accelerated the progression of AS and increased the secretions of inflammatory cytokines in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, PAL exhibited anti-AS effects by regulating the gut microbiota-phenylalanine metabolism axis.",

The efficacy of five alkaloids in RC and the dose-dependent effects of the most effective PAL in CAG mice were evaluated in two animal experiments. RNA-seq and western blot revealed that PAL significantly improved IL-17, TNF, and NF-kappa B inflammation-related signaling pathways. Further hub gene prediction and experimental validation revealed that PAL modulated the STAT1/CXCL10 axis, thereby exerting attenuation of CAG through the regulation of IL-17, TNF-α, and p-p65 expression. In conclusion, PAL was proposed to mitigate MNNG-induced CAG, potentially through the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses via the STAT1/CXCL10 axis. This approach is an effective complement to the use of PAL in the treatment of CAG.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Palmatine was isolated from the methanol extract of Fibraurea tinctoria Lour stems by silica gel column chromatography. Structural elucidation of the isolated compounds was performed using spectral data analysis and comparison with the literature. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantitatively determine palmatine in the crude methanol extract and fractions. The DPPH and non-enzymatic SOD mimic methods were used to assess the antioxidant activity of the methanol extract, fractions, and isolated compounds. The antidiabetic activity was evaluated in silico by the molecular docking method of alpha-glucosidase and DPP-IV enzymes. Palmatine was used as a test ligand and was compared with berberine and its native ligand or standard compounds. RESULTS: The isolated compound was identified as palmatine. Quantification of palmatine compound by HPLC showed that palmatine was found in the extract and all fractions. In the in vitro antioxidant activity test using the DPPH method, fraction 4 showed the highest activity, with an IC50 value of 91 ppm. In contrast, using the non-enzymatic SOD mimic method, the methanol extract, fraction 5, and isolated compound (palmatine) exhibited very strong antioxidant activity, with IC50 values of 18, 20, and 28 ppm, respectively. The in silico antidiabetic activity of palmatine is thought to have the potential to inhibit these two enzymes. CONCLUSION: These results showed that Fibraurea tinctoria Lour stems have potential as an antioxidant and antidiabetic agent. Further research on phytochemical and pharmacological is required to validate the use of this plant species for the treatment of various diseases, especially diabetes mellitus.",

Negative regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation through mitophagy may be an important strategy to control NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated proinflammatory responses. Palmatine (PAL), an isoquinoline alkaloid found in various of plants, has potent pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation. However, the specific role of PAL in the pathology of Parkinson's disease remains unclear. In this study, we found that treatment with PAL improved motor deficits and reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP mice. Further results showed that PAL promoted mitophagy and inhibited the proinflammatory response mediated by NLRP3 inflammasomes. In addition, chloroquine (CQ, mitophagy inhibitor) attenuated the ameliorative effects of PAL on the motor deficits and dopaminergic neuron damage, as well as the inhibitory effect of PAL on NLRP3 inflammasome. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that PAL ameliorates motor deficits and dopaminergic neuron death in Parkinson's disease, and the mechanism may be related to its inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation via promoting mitophagy.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Palmatine is a main bioactive alkaloid of Cortex Phellodendri, which has been commonly prescribed for the treatment of hyperuricemia (HUA) in China. The metabolites of palmatine were crucial to its prominent biological activity. 9-Hydroxy-8-oxypalmatine (9-OPAL) is a novel liver-mediated secondary oxymetabolite of palmatine. AIM OF THE STUDY: The current study was to assess the efficacy of 9-OPAL, a novel liver-mediated secondary oxymetabolite of palmatine derived from Cortex Phellodendri, in experimental HUA mouse model and further explore its underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An in vitro metabolic experiment with oxypalmatine was carried out using liver samples. We separated and identified a novel liver metabolite, and investigated its anti-HUA effect in mice. HUA mice were induced by potassium oxonate and hypoxanthine daily for one week. After 1 h of modeling, mice were orally administered with different doses of 9-OPAL (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg). The pathological changes of the kidneys were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E). The acute toxicity of 9-OPAL was assessed. The effects of 9-OPAL on serum levels of uric acid (UA), adenosine deaminase (ADA), xanthine oxidase (XOD), creatinine (CRE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and inflammatory cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or biochemical method. Furthermore, Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and molecular docking were used to investigate the effect of 9-OPAL on the expression of renal urate transporters and NLRP3 signaling pathway in HUA mice. RESULTS: 9-OPAL had been discovered to be a novel liver-mediated oxymetabolite of palmatine for the first time. Treatment with 9-OPAL significantly reduced the UA, CRE as well as BUN levels, and also effectively attenuated abnormal renal histopathological deterioration with favorable safety profile. Besides, 9-OPAL significantly decreased the serum and hepatic activities of XOD and ADA, dramatically inhibited the up-regulation of UA transporter protein 1 (URAT1) and glucose transporter protein 9 (GLUT9), and reversed the down-regulation of organic anion transporter protein 1 (OAT1). Additionally, 9-OPAL effectively mitigated the renal inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-18), and downregulated the transcriptional and translational expressions of renal Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), caspase-1, apoptosis-associated speck-like (ASC) and IL-1β in HUA mice. Molecular docking results revealed 9-OPAL bound firmly with XOD, OAT1, GLUT9, URAT1, NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC and IL-1β. CONCLUSIONS: 9-OPAL was found to be a novel liver-mediated secondary metabolite of palmatine with favorable safety profile. 9-OPAL had eminent anti-hyperuricemic and renal-protective effects, and the mechanisms might be intimately associated with repressing XOD activities, modulating renal urate transporter expression and suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our investigation might also provide further experimental evidence for the traditional application of Cortex Phellodendri in the treatment of HUA.",

Methyl gallate and palmatine have been reported to exhibit antiplasmodial activities but the antimalarial activity of their combination has not been evaluated. Therefore, the evaluation of the combination of methyl gallate and palmatine for antimalarial activity in vitro and in vivo in the presence of piperine was carried out. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibitory potential of methyl gallate and palmatine combination on β-hematin (hemozoin) formation was studied in vitro. Also, the antimalarial activity of methyl gallate and palmatine combination with/without a bioenhancer (piperine) was evaluated in Plasmodium berghei NK65-infected mice. RESULTS: Methyl gallate and palmatine in the ratio 3:2 acted synergistically in vitro and had the highest inhibitory effect (IC50 = 0.73 µg/mL) on β-hematin (hemozoin) formation. The 3:2 combination of methyl gallate and palmatine exhibited no antimalarial activity in vivo in the absence of piperine but caused reduction in parasitemia that exceeded 40% in the presence of piperine at the dose of 25 mg/kg body weight on days 6 and 8 post-inoculation in mice. CONCLUSION: The 3:2 combination of methyl gallate and palmatine in the presence of piperine exhibited antimalarial activity in vivo, possibly by synergistic inhibition of hemozoin formation which may cause accumulation of haem within the food vacuole of Plasmodium spp. and its death.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary degenerative encephalopathy that first appeared as a decline in memory and learning skills. Over time, the condition's severity grew. Palmatine (Pal) alleviates Alzheimer's disease symptoms, which has neuroprotective benefits. Numerous investigations have demonstrated a close relationship among AD and gut structure changes. The aim of the research was investigating whether the improvement of Pal on AD is linked to regulating gut flora and autophagy. First, we used Aβ1-40 to induce apoptosis in HT22 cells. After Pal treatment, apoptosis can be improved. Then, We used bilateral intracranial hippocampal injection of Aβ1-40 for establishing the AD model, after treatment with Pal, the morris water maze experiment and eight-arm maze test demonstrated that Pal enhanced the AD rats' capacity for learning and memory, HE staining illustrated that Pal improved the morphological abnormalities of brain cells and gut tissue damage. Pal reduced the death of hippocampus neurons, as shown by Nissl staining. Pal substantially reduced Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ accumulation in the brain, according to immunohistochemical labelling. Pal improved the expression of LC3, Beclin 1, AMPK, and suppressed the expression of mTOR and P62, as validated by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence labelling. This suggests that Pal's treatment of AD may be associated with the control of the AMPK/mTOR autophagy signalling system. 16S rRNA sequencing and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) content detection analysis illustrated that Pal has the potential to enhance the content of SCFAs, reverse the alterations in gut microorganisms. It has been showed by the study that Pal could improve AD by activating autophagy signaling pathway and improving gut barrier changes.",

      "abstract": "Particulate matter (PM) induces and enhances oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to a variety of respiratory diseases, including acute lung injury. Exploring new treatments for PM-induced lung injury has long been of interest to researchers. Palmatine (PAL) is a natural extract derived from plants that has been reported in many studies to alleviate inflammatory diseases. Our study was designed to explore whether PAL can alleviate acute lung injury caused by PM. The acute lung injury model was established by instilling PM (4 mg/kg) into the airway of mice, and PAL (50 mg/kg and 100 m/kg) was administrated orally as the treatment groups. The effect and mechanism of PAL treatment were examined by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, Western Blotting, ELISA, and other experiments. The results showed that oral administration of PAL (50 mg/kg and 100 m/kg) could significantly alleviate lung inflammation and acute lung injury caused by PM. In terms of mechanism, we found that PAL (50 mg/kg) exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-damage effects mainly by enhancing the activation of the Nrf2-related antioxidant pathway and inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3-related pyroptosis pathway in mice. These mechanisms have also been verified in our cell experiments. Further cell experiments showed that PAL may reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating Nrf2-related pathways, thereby inhibiting the activation of NLRP3-related pyroptosis pathway induced by PM in Beas-2B cell. Our study suggests that PAL can be a new option for PM-induced acute lung injury.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease whose pathogenesis and mechanisms have not been fully described. The m6A methylation modification is a general mRNA modification in mammalian cells and is closely associated with the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Palmatine (PAL) is a biologically active alkaloid with anti-inflammatory and protective effects in animal models of colitis. Accordingly, we examined the role of PAL on colitis by regulating N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation. METHODS: A rat experimental colitis model was established by 5 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days, then PAL treatment was administered for seven days. The colonic tissue pathology was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and disease activity index (DAI). In in vitro studies, a human, spontaneously immortalized non-cancerous colon mucosal epithelial cell line (NCM460) was exposed to 2 % DSS and treated with PAL and cell viability was assayed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). The levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The level of Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) was dectected by immunofluorescence. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of cells was also assessed. The methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), METTL14, AlkB homologate 5 (ALKBH5), and fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) expression levels were assessed by western blotting. The localized expression of m6A was measured by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: PAL significantly prevented bodyweight loss and shortening of the colon in experimental colitis rats, as well as decreasing the DAI and histological damage scores. Furthermore, PAL inhibited the levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β) in both DSS treated rats and NCM460 cells. In addition, PAL enhanced the expression level of ZO-1, and increased the transepithelial electrical resistance to repaire intestinal barrier dysfunction. Colitis occurred due to decreased m6A levels, and the increased FTO expression led to a colitis phenotype. PAL markedly enhanced the METTL3 and METTL14 expression levels while decreasing ALKBH5 and FTO expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated that PAL improved DSS-induced experimental colitis. This effect was associated with inhibiting FTO expression and regulating m6A methylation.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis, the hallmark of cardiovascular disease, is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the heart. Emerging evidence indicates that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) play pivotal roles in driving cardiac fibrosis. However, due to incomplete insights into CFs, there are limited effective approaches to prevent or reverse cardiac fibrosis currently. Palmatine, a protoberberine alkaloid extracted from traditional Chinese botanical remedies, possesses diverse biological effects. This study investigated the potential therapeutic value and mechanism of palmatine against cardiac fibrosis. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were treated with vehicle, isoproterenol (ISO), or ISO plus palmatine for one week. After echocardiography assessment, mice hearts were collected for histopathology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analyses. Primary rat CFs were utilized in vitro. Compared to control, ISO-treated mice exhibited cardiac hypertrophy and structural abnormalities; however, treatment with palmatine ameliorated these effects of ISO. Moreover, palmatine treatment mitigated ISO-induced cardiac fibrosis. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis showed that palmatine strongly binds the regulators of cardiac fibrosis including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and mammalian target of rapamycin. Furthermore, palmatine reduced the elevated fibrotic factor expressions and overactivated STAT3 induced by ISO, Transformed growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), or interleukin-6 both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, blocking STAT3 suppressed the TGF-β1-induced CF activation. Collectively, these data demonstrated that palmatine attenuated cardiac fibrosis partly by inhibiting fibroblast activation through the STAT3 pathway. This provides an experimental basis for the clinical treatment of cardiac fibrosis with palmatine.",

      "abstract": "Previously, we demonstrated that palmatine (PALM) - an isoquinoline alkaloid from Berberis sibrica radix, exerted antiseizure activity in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure assay in larval zebrafish. The aim of the present study was to more precisely characterize PALM as a potential anticonvulsant drug candidate. A range of zebrafish and mouse seizure/epilepsy models were applied in the investigation. Immunostaining analysis was conducted to assess the changes in mouse brains, while in silico molecular modelling was performed to determine potential targets for PALM. Accordingly, PALM had anticonvulsant effect in ethyl 2-ketopent-4-enoate (EKP)-induced seizure assay in zebrafish larvae as well as in the 6 Hz-induced psychomotor seizure threshold and timed infusion PTZ tests in mice. The protective effect in the EKP-induced seizure assay was confirmed in the local field potential recordings. PALM did not affect seizures in the gabra1a knockout line of zebrafish larvae. In the scn1Lab-/- zebrafish line, pretreatment with PALM potentiated seizure-like behaviour of larvae. Repetitive treatment with PALM, however, did not reduce development of PTZ-induced seizure activity nor prevent the loss of parvalbumin-interneurons in the hippocampus of the PTZ kindled mice. In silico molecular modelling revealed that the noted anticonvulsant effect of PALM in EKP-induced seizure assay might result from its interactions with glutamic acid decarboxylase and/or via AMPA receptor non-competitive antagonism. Our study has demonstrated the anticonvulsant activity of PALM in some experimental models of seizures, including a model of pharmacoresistant seizures induced by EKP. These results indicate that PALM might be a suitable new drug candidate but the precise mechanism of its anticonvulsant activity has to be determined.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), a common neurological complication from sepsis, is widespread among patients in intensive care unit and is linked to substantial morbidity and mortality rates, thus posing a substantial menace to human health. Due to the intricate nature of SAE's pathogenesis, there remains a dearth of efficacious therapeutic protocols, encompassing pharmaceutical agents and treatment modalities, up until the present time. Palmatine exhibits distinctive benefits in the regulation of inflammation for the improvement of sepsis. Nevertheless, the precise functions of palmatine in treating SAE and its underlying mechanism have yet to be elucidated. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate efficiency of palmatine in SAE mice and its underlying mechanisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Behavioral experiments, percent survival rate analysis, histological analysis, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA analysis, were performed to evaluate the efficiency of palmatine in SAE mice. Quantibody® mouse inflammation array glass chip was performed to observe the effects of palmatine on inflammation storm in SAE mice. Real-time quantitative and western blotting analyzes were employed to examine the expression of relevant targets in the Notch1/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Finally, brain tissues metabolomics-based analyzes were performed to detect the differentially expressed metabolites and metabolic pathways. The fecal samples were subjected to microbial 16S rRNA analysis and untargeted metabolomics analysis in order to identify the specific flora and metabolites associated with SAE, thereby further investigating the mechanism of palmatine in SAE mice. RESULTS: Our results showed that palmatine significantly improved nerve function, reduced cell apoptosis in brain tissue, and decreased inflammatory cytokine levels in SAE induced-LPS mice. Meanwhile, our results demonstrate the potential of palmatine in modulating key components of the Notch1/NF-κB pathway, enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins, improving intestinal permeability, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria (such as Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group), inhibiting the proliferation of harmful bacteria (such as Escherichia-Shigella), and mitigating metabolic disorders. Ultimately, these observed effects contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of palmatine in treating SAE. CONCLUSION: The findings of our study have provided confirmation regarding the efficacy of palmatine in the treatment of SAE, thereby establishing a solid foundation for further exploration into SAE therapy and the advancement and investigation of palmatine.",

This study evaluated the anti-viral activity of palmatine, a natural non-flavonoid alkaloid, against IBV in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells.2. The half toxic concentration (CC50) of palmatine was 672.92 μM, the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of palmatine against IBV was 7.76 μM and the selection index (SI) was 86.74.3. Mode of action assay showed that palmatine was able to directly inactivate IBV and inhibited the adsorption, penetration and intracellular replication of IBV.4. Palmatine significantly upregulated TRAF6, TAB1 and IKK-β compared with the IBV-infected group, leading to the increased expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in the downstream NF-κB signalling pathway.5. Palmatine significantly up-regulated the levels of MDA5, MAVS, IRF7, IFN-α and IFN-β in the IRF7 pathway, inducing type I interferon production. It up-regulated the expression of 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) in the JAK-STAT pathway.6. IBV infection induced cell apoptosis and palmatine-treatment delayed the process of apoptosis by regulation of the expression of apoptosis-related genes (BAX, BCL-2, CASPASE-3 and CASPASE-8).7. Palmatine could exert anti-IBV activity through regulation of NF-κB/IRF7/JAK-STAT signalling pathways and apoptosis, providing a theoretical basis for the utilisation of palmatine to treat IBV infection.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a common degenerative disease which has a great impact on people's daily lives, but there is still a certain market gap in the drug research about it. Palmatine, one of the main components of Huangteng, the rattan stem of Fibraurea recisa Pierre (Menispermaceae), has potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of palmatine on amyloid beta protein 25-35-induced rat pheochromocytoma cells and AD mice and to investigate its mechanism of action. CCK8 assays, ELISA, the Morris water maze assay, fluorescent probes, calcein/PI staining, immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis were used. The experimental results show that palmatine can increase the survival rate of Aβ25-35-induced PC12 cells and mouse hippocampal neurons, reduce apoptosis, reduce the content of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, GSH, SOD, MDA and ROS, improve the learning and memory ability of AD mice, inhibit the expression of Keap-1 and Bax, and promote the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and Bcl-2. We conclude that palmatine can ameliorate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation produced by Aβ25-35-induced PC12 cells and mice by modulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that palmatine may have a potential therapeutic effect on AD and could be further investigated as a promising therapeutic agent for AD. It provides a theoretical basis for the development of related drugs.",

Palmatine (PAL) is a main chemical component of Yajieshaba, which has been found to effectively alleviate the symptoms of food allergy. However, its role and mechanism in CSU remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of PAL on CSU rats. METHODS: We replicated the CSU rat model by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) in rats on days 0, 2, 4, and 14, with a double dose given on the last challenge. PAL, loratadine and saline were given by gavage from day 5 to day 14. We observed the skin pathologic changes, mast cell degranulation, immune factor levels, inflammatory response and autophagy-related protein expression in CSU rats. RESULTS: We found PAL treatment to be effective in alleviating CSU-like skin lesions and reducing itching and mast cell degranulation in rats. Compared with the OVA group, the levels of immune and inflammatory factors were significantly reduced, neutrophil recruitment was alleviated, suggesting a reduced inflammatory response. The autophagy results showed that PAL further increased the expression of LC3, Beclin-1 and p-LKB1, p-AMPK, Atg5, Atg12 and Atg5-Atg12, while P62 and p-p70S6K1 expression decreased. They collectively suggested that autophagic flux was activated after PAL treatment. However, there was an increase in the expression of LC3I, probably due to the fact that PAL induced its accumulation in order to provide substrate for the generation of more LC3II. DISCUSSION: Overall, PAL had a protective effect on CSU in normal rats, activated the expression of autophagy and improved the inflammatory response.",

However, the role of palmatine in mitophagy, a fundamental process crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function, remains elusive. In this study, we found that palmatine efficiently induces mitophagy in various human cell lines. Palmatine specifically induces mitophagy and subsequently stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis. Palmatine did not interfere with mitochondrial function, similar to CCCP, suggesting that palmatine is not toxic to mitochondria. Importantly, palmatine treatment alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction in PINK1-knockout MEFs. Moreover, the administration of palmatine resulted in significant improvements in cognitive function and restored mitochondrial function in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. This study identifies palmatine as a novel inducer of selective mitophagy. Our results suggest that palmatine-mediated mitophagy induction could be a potential strategy for Alzheimer's disease treatment and that natural alkaloids are potential sources of mitophagy inducers.",

      "abstract": "Canine mammary gland tumors (CMTs) are the most common and lethal cancers in female dogs. Dysregulated phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/AKT pathway reportedly was involved in the growth and metastasis of CMTs. However, there are few studies on therapeutic strategies for targeting the PI3K pathway in CMTs. In this study, we aimed to determine whether palmatine, a natural isoquinoline alkaloid with anti-cancer properties, could inhibit the growth of CMTs and whether the inhibitory effect was mediated through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our in vitro experiments on CMT-U27, a CMT cell line, showed that palmatine reduced cell proliferation and induced cell death. Western blotting results revealed that palmatine decreased the protein expression of PI3K, PTEN, AKT, and mechanistic target of rapamycin in the PI3K/AKT pathway, which was supported by the results of immunocytochemistry. Additionally, palmatine suppressed the migration and tube formation of canine aortic endothelial cells as well as the migration of CMT U27 cells. Our in vivo results showed that palmatine inhibited tumor growth in a CMT-U27 mouse xenograft model. We observed a decreased expression of proteins in the PI3K/AKT pathway in tumor tissues, similar to the in vitro results. Furthermore, palmatine significantly disrupted the tumor vasculature and inhibited metastasis to adjacent lymph nodes. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that palmatine exerts anti-cancer effects against CMTs by inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting that palmatine has potential as a canine-specific PI3K inhibitor for the treatment of CMTs.",

Five alkaloid components were obtained from the traditional Chinese medicine Huangteng through literature mining. Molecular docking and MD simulation with acetylcholinesterase were used to screen palmatine. At the animal level, mice were injected with LPS intracerebrally to cause a neuroinflammatory model, and the Morris water maze experiment was performed to examine the learning memory of mice. Anxiety levels were tested using the autonomous activity behavior experiment with the open field and elevated behavior experiments. HE staining and Niss staining were performed on brain tissue sections to observe morphological lesions and apoptosis; serum was examined for inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β; Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression. The expression of PI3K/AKT/NFkB signaling pathway-related proteins was examined by Western blot. The results of network pharmacology showed that the screening of palmatine activation containing the PI3K/Akt/NFkB signaling pathway exerts antineuroinflammatory effects. Results from behavioral experiments showed that Pal enhanced learning memory in model mice, improved anxiety behavior, and significantly improved brain damage caused by neuroinflammation. The results of HE staining and Niss staining of brain tissue sections showed that palmatine could alleviate morphological lesions and nucleus damage in brain tissue. Palmatine improved the levels of serum inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. SOD, MDA, CAT, ACH, and ACHE in the hippocampus were improved. Western blot results showed that palmatine administration ameliorated LPS-induced neuroinflammation through the PI3K/Akt/NFkB pathway.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation is one of the major pathogeneses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mainly involves abnormal inflammatory activation of microglia by multiple pathological stimuli. The treatment of AD remains a major challenge due to the multifactorial characterization of AD and the inefficient ability of therapeutic drugs to permeate through the blood‒brain barrier (BBB). Accordingly, drug combination treatment and drug carrier delivery have become important therapeutic tools for the treatment of multifactorial diseases, especially AD. METHODS: Inflammatory cytokine levels in microglia, including NO, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-4, and IL-10, were detected. The Morris water maze and object location task were used to investigate the learning and memory functions of APP/PS1 mice in different treatment groups. The number of neurons and plasticity of synapses were evaluated by immunofluorescence double labelling. Additionally, the ratio of β-amyloid plaques and the number of activated microglia were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. The concentrations of β-amyloid plaques and inflammatory factors in the hippocampus were determined by ELISA. Microglia-derived exosomes (Exos) were extracted and purified by size exclusion chromatography. The distribution of exosomes and drugs was investigated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Compared to single drug interventions, the combination of Ber and Pal (Ber/Pal) modulated microglial inflammatory cytokine levels. Ber/Pal promoted the recovery of learning and memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that Ber/Pal restored neurons, inhibited Aβ plaque formation and microglial activation, and regulated the secretion of inflammatory factors. Exos promoted the accumulation of drugs in cells and tissues and improved the targeting of drugs across the BBB. CONCLUSION: Ber/Pal could offer a synergistic and more comprehensive therapeutic effect in AD. Additionally, the microglia-derived Exos-Ber/Pal delivery system promoted the targeting and permeation of drugs into the brain, suggesting a creative strategy for targeting AD therapy by regulating neuroinflammation in microglial cells.",

      "abstract": "Aeromonas hydrophila, an opportunistic aquatic pathogen widely spread in aquatic environments, is responsible for a number of infectious diseases in freshwater aquaculture. In addition, A. hydrophila can transmit from diseased fish to humans and results in health problems. The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains restricts the application of antibiotics and is responsible for failure of the treatment. Moreover, residues of antibiotics in aquatic products often threaten the quality and safety. Therefore, alternative strategies are called to deal with infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Aerolysin, one of the most important virulence factors of A. hydrophila, is adopted as a unique anti-virulence target on the basis of the anti-virulence strategy to battling infections caused by A. hydrophila. Palmatine, an isoquinoline alkaloid from a variety of herbal medicines that showed no anti-A. hydrophila activity, could reduce hemolysis of the bacterium by decreasing aerolysin production. The results of the qPCR assay demonstrated that the transcription of the aerA gene was suppressed. Moreover, cell viability and in vivo study showed that palmatine treatment could decrease the pathogenicity of A. hydrophila both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, palmatine is a leading compound against A. hydrophila-associated infection in aquaculture by inhibiting the expression of aerolysin."

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is one of the major causes of human morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of ischemic stroke involves complex events, including oxidative stress and inflammation, that lead to neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. Palmatine (PAL) is a naturally occurring (Coptidis rhizome) isoquinoline alkaloid that belongs to the class of protoberberines and has a wide spectrum of pharmacological and biological effects. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of Palmatine on neuronal damage, memory deficits, and inflammatory response in mice submitted to permanent focal cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery (pMCAO) occlusion. The animals were treated with Palmatine (0.2, 2 and 20 mg/kg/day, orally) or vehicle (3% Tween + saline solution) 2 h after pMCAO once daily for 3 days. Cerebral ischemia was confirmed by evaluating the infarct area (TTC staining) and neurological deficit score 24 h after pMCAO. Treatment with palmatine (2 and 20 mg/kg) reduced infarct size and neurological deficits and prevented working and aversive memory deficits in ischemic mice. Palmatine, at a dose of 2 mg/kg, had a similar effect of reducing neuroinflammation 24 h after cerebral ischemia, decreasing TNF-, iNOS, COX-2, and NF- κB immunoreactivities and preventing the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Moreover, palmatine (2 mg/kg) reduced COX-2, iNOS, and IL-1β immunoreactivity 96 h after pMCAO. The neuroprotective properties of palmatine make it an excellent adjuvant treatment for strokes due to its inhibition of neuroinflammation.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Corydalis saxicola Bunting (CS), a traditional Chinese folk medicine, has been effectively used for treating liver disease in Zhuang nationality in South China. However, the main anti-liver fibrosis ingredients in CS are incompletely understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the main anti-liver fibrosis ingredients in CS and its underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Firstly, spectrum-effect relationship (SER) strategy was applied to identify the major ingredients against liver fibrosis in CS. Subsequently, 1H NMR metabonomics and metagenomics sequencing techniques were used to clarify the intervention of palmatine (PAL) on liver fibrosis. Furthermore, the expression of tight junction proteins and the levels of liver inflammation factors were examined, the effect of PAL on microbiota was verified by FMT. RESULTS: The SER model revealed that PAL was the most important active ingredient in CS. 1H NMR fecal metabonomics showed that PAL could reserve the abnormal levels of gut microbial-mediated metabolites of liver fibrosis, such as isoleucine, taurine, butyrate, propionate, lactate, glucose, which mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, intestinal flora metabolism and energy metabolism. Metagenomics sequencing found that PAL could callback the abundance of s__Lactobacillus_murinus, s__Lactobacillus_reuteri, s__Lactobacillus_johnsonii, s__Lactobacillus_acidophilus and s__Faecalibaculum_rodentium to varying degree. Furthermore, the intestinal barrier function and the levels of hepatic inflammation factors were significantly ameliorated by PAL. FMT demonstrated that the therapeutic efficiency of PAL was closely associated with gut microbiota. CONCLUSION: The effects of CS on liver fibrosis were attributed in part to PAL by alleviating metabolic disorders and rebalancing gut microbiota. The SER strategy may be a useful method for the discovery of active constituents in natural plants.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: ErXian decoction is a Chinese herbal compound that can prevent and control the course of osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis (OP). OP and OA are two age-related diseases that often coexist in elderly individuals, and both are associated with dysregulation of the gut microbiome. In the initial study, Palmatine (PAL) was obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and network pharmacological screening techniques, followed by 16S rRNA sequencing and serum metabolomics of intestinal contents, to explore the mechanism of PAL in the treatment of OA and OP. METHODS: The rats selected for this study were randomly divided into three groups: a sham group, an OA-OP group and a PAL group. The sham group was intragastrically administered normal saline solution, and the PLA group was treated with PAL for 56 days. Through microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), ELISA, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and non-targeted metabonomics research, we explored the potential mechanism of intestinal microbiota and serum metabolites in PAL treatment of OA-OP rats. RESULTS: Palmatine significantly repair bone microarchitecture of rat femur in OA-OP rats and improved cartilage damage. The analysis of intestinal microflora showed that PAL could also improve the intestinal microflora disorder of OA-OP rats. For example, the abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Actinobacteria, Lactobacillus, unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae, norank_f_Muribaculaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Muribaculaceae increased after PAL intervention. In addition, the results of metabolomics data analysis showed that PAL also change the metabolic status of OA-OP rats. After PAL intervention, metabolites such as 5-methoxytryptophol, 2-methoxy acetaminophen sulfate, beta-tyrosine, indole-3-carboxylic acid-O-sulfate and cyclodopa glucoside increased. Association analysis of metabolomics and gut microbiota (GM) showed that the communication of multiple flora and different metabolites played an important role in OP and OA. CONCLUSION: Palmatine can improve cartilage degeneration and bone loss in OA-OP rats. The evidence we provided supports the idea that PAL improves OA-OP by altering GM and serum metabolites. In addition, the application of GM and serum metabolomics correlation analysis provides a new strategy for uncovering the mechanism of herbal treatment for bone diseases."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent diseases that lead to memory deficiencies, severe behavioral abnormalities, and ultimately death. The need for more appropriate treatment of AD continues, and remains a sought-after goal. Previous studies showed palmatine (PAL), an isoquinoline alkaloid, might have the potential for combating AD because of its in vitro and in vivo activities. In this study, we aimed to assess PAL's therapeutic potential and gain insights into the working mechanism on protein level in the AD mouse model brain, for the first time. To this end, PAL was administered to 12-month-old 5xFAD mice at two doses after its successful isolation from the Siberian barberry shrub. PAL (10 mg/kg) showed statistically significant improvement in the memory and learning phase on the Morris water maze test. The PAL's ability to pass through the blood-brain barrier was verified via Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM). Label-free proteomics analysis revealed PAL administration led to changes most prominently in the cerebellum, followed by the hippocampus, but none in the cortex. Most of the differentially expressed proteins in PAL compared to the 5xFAD control group (ALZ) were the opposite of those in ALZ in comparison to healthy Alzheimer's littermates (ALM) group. HS105, HS12A, and RL12 were detected as hub proteins in the cerebellum. Collectively, here we present PAL as a potential therapeutic candidate owing to its alleviating effect in 5xFAD mice on not only cognitive impairment but also proteomes in the cerebellum and hippocampus.",

      "abstract": "(1) Insulin resistance, a symptom of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is caused by the inactivation of the insulin signaling pathway, which includes IRS-PI3K-IRS-1-PKC-AKT2 and GLUT4. Metformin (biguanide) and glimepiride (sulfonylurea) are both drugs that are derivatives of urea, and they are widely used as first-line drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Palmatine has been previously reported to possess antidiabetic and antioxidant properties. (2) The current study compared palmatine to metformin and glimepiride in a type 2 diabetes model for ADME and insulin resistance via the PI3K/Akt/GLUT4 signaling pathway: in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo, and in silico molecular docking. (3) Methods: Differentiated L6 skeletal muscle cells and soleus muscle tissue were incubated in standard tissue culture media supplemented with high insulin and high glucose as a cellular model of insulin resistance, whilst streptozotocin (STZ)-induced Sprague Dawley rats were used as the diabetic model. The cells/tissue/animals were treated with palmatine, while glimepiride and metformin were used as standard drugs. The differential gene expression of PI3K, IRS-1, PKC-α, AKT2, and GLUT4 was evaluated using qPCR. (4) Results: The results revealed that the genes IRS-PI3K-IRS-1-PKC-AKT2 were significantly down-regulated, whilst PKC-α was upregulated significantly in both insulin-resistant cells and tissue animals. Interestingly, palmatine-treated cells/tissue/animals were able to reverse these effects. (5) Conclusions: Palmatine appears to have rejuvenated the impaired insulin signaling pathway through upregulation of the gene expression of IRS-1, PI3K, AKT2, and GLUT4 and downregulation of PKC-expression, according to in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Palmatine (Pal) is a major bioactive alkaloid originated from ancient Chinese herbal medicine Cortex Phellodendri Amurensis (CPA), which has long been applied to treat hyperuricemia (HUA)-related diseases. Pal possesses potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects against metabolic diseases. However, its potential beneficial effect against PO (potassium oxonate)/HX (hypoxanthine)-induced HUA remains elusive. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the potential pharmacological effect and mechanism of Pal on PO/HX-induced HUA in mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A mouse model of HUA was established by co-administration of PO/HX once daily for 7 consecutive days. The HUA mice were orally given three doses (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) of Pal daily for a week. Febuxostat (Feb, 5 mg/kg) was given as a positive control. At the scheduled termination of the experiment, the whole blood, liver and kidney were collected for subsequent analyses. The concentrations of uric acid (UA), creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) were evaluated. Histopathological alterations of the kidney were detected by H&E staining. The inflammatory and oxidative stress status was detected by assay kits. Additionally, key proteins involved in the urate transporter, Keap1-Nrf2 and TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathways were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Finally, molecular docking was employed to probe the binding characteristics of Pal and target proteins Keap1, NLRP3, URAT1 and HO-1. RESULTS: Administration of Pal substantially decreased the elevated kidney weight, lowered UA, CRE and BUN levels, and attenuated abnormal histopathological alterations. Meanwhile, treatment with Pal also dramatically lowered hepatic XOD and ADA activities. Besides, Pal treatment effectively mitigated the renal inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. Further mechanistic investigation indicated Pal distinctly downregulated the protein levels of GLUT9 and URAT1, while up-regulated the expression levels of OAT1 and ABCG2. Pal also restored Nrf2 activation, promoted subsequent expression of anti-oxidative enzymes, and downregulated the expressions of TXNIP, NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like (ASC), caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18. Molecular docking analysis also indicated Pal firmly bound with Keap1, NLRP3, URAT1 and HO-1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that Pal exhibited favorable anti-HUA effect via modulating the expressions of transporter-related proteins and suppressing XOD activity. Furthermore, Pal also alleviated HUA-induced kidney injury, which was at least partially related to restoring Keap1-Nrf2 pathway and inhibiting TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome. Our investigation was envisaged to provide experimental support for the traditional application of CPA and CPA-containing classical herbal formulas in the management of HUA-related diseases and might provide novel dimension to the clinical application of Pal.",

The mechanism of action of palmatine in depression has been rarely reported and remains unclear. The present study examined the neuroprotective effects of palmatine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and depression-like behavior. In this study, cell apoptosis was evaluated by CCK-8, flow cytometry, and Hoechst 33258 staining in LPS-induced HT-22 cells. Meanwhile, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected in vitro. In vivo, we investigated depressive-like behaviors in mice by an open field test (OFT) and elevated plus-maze test (EPM). Additionally, the levels of superoxide dismutases (SOD), TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The hematoxylin-eosin staining and TUNEL staining were used to evaluate the pathology of the hippocampus. The expression of Nrf2/HO-1 and BAX/Bcl-2 pathways in the hippocampus were assessed by Western blot analysis. Palmatine could significantly reduce apoptosis and ROS levels, and improve mitochondrial damage. Moreover, palmatine significantly improves movement time and central square crossing time in OFT, and improves open arms and movement time in EMP. And the levels of SOD, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were significantly decreased after palmatine treatment. More importantly, palmatine improved neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus, and depression through BAX/Bcl-2 and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways. We provide evidence that palmatine further alleviates the depressive-like behavior of LPS-induced by improving apoptosis and oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The key molecular mechanism of palmatine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was investigated in this article. METHODS: Network pharmacology techniques constructed drug-target-disease relationship networks and predictive pathways of action. At the cellular level, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce Raw 264.7 cells to establish an inflammation model, and interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α indicators were examined. Apoptosis was detected using Hoechst 33258. At the animal level, LPS was used to induce AD animal model, and behavioral performance were examined by water maze, and serum biochemical indexes were measured by ELISA. And the expression of PI3K and P-AKT was observed by immunohistochemistry. Finally, molecular level validation was performed using the molecular docking technique. RESULTS: The result of Network pharmacological was predicted that palmatine may treat AD mainly through the PI3K pathway. Palmatine has no significant effect on Raw264.7 cells viability within 0.05 mg/ml, Palmatine can significantly induce Raw264.7 cells to secret IL-6 and IL1-β in a concentration-dependent manner, but it has not obvious impact on NO and TNF-α. Palmatine has a significant restorative effect on the cell viability of Raw264.7 in a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Palmatine can be concentration-dependent to downregulate the secretion of LPS-induced IL-6. At the same time, Palmatine also has a significant effect on the level of TNF-α induced by LPS, it also can slightly downregulate the secretion of IL-1β. The results of Hoechst33258 showed that cells in the 0.025 mg/ml and 0.5 mg/ml delivery groups increased with different degrees of bright blue fluorescence, and apoptosis rate decreased. Animal experiments showed that palmatine effectively improved the learning and memory ability of AD mice. The immunohistochemical results exhibited that the expression of PI3K and P-AKT in the model group decreased, but they were obvious reversed by palmatine The molecular docking results showed that palmatine and key targets had good docking, among which the binding to ERBB2, CDC42, MDM2, and mTOR was the most likely. CONCLUSION: Palmatine has neuroprotective effects. Palmatine could effectively ameliorate memory impairment in AD mice by promoting the PI3K-AKT pathway. Molecular docking results showed that palmatine has a better binding ability with mTOR.",

The cellular process of autophagy which recycles damaged organelles to maintain protein and organelle homeostasis is found to positively influence survival during hepatic insufficiency, although the mechanism is poorly understood. Palmatine (PLT) has a variety of biological functions, such as broad-spectrum antibacterial action, neuroprotective, antioxidant stress, and antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. However, it is not known whether PLT has a protective effect against alcoholic liver injury. Here, we investigated the protective effect of PLT in a cellular model of alcohol-induced acute liver injury and further explored its mechanism of action. In this study, we show for the first time that PLT attenuates alcohol-induced hepatocyte injury by promoting autophagy to play an essential protective role. As PLT treatment induced a brief increase in LC3-II conversion and p62 degradation, it also upregulated the expression of ATG5 and ATG7. The expression levels of the proapoptotic proteins Bax, Caspase 3, and Caspase 9 significantly decreased, while the antiapoptotic protein levels of Bcl-2 upregulated after treatment with PLT. However, in presence of the autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine, the effect of PLT in inhibiting ethanol-induced hepatocyte injury reversed significantly. Mechanistically, the protective effects of PLT may be mediated by promoting the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. Therefore, we believe that the development of alcoholic liver injuries may be controlled by PLT by inhibiting hepatocyte apoptosis through the autophagy pathway. The study lays a solid theoretical and practical basis for future animal models and clinical studies of PLT.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gouty arthritis could be triggered by the deposition of monosodium uric acid (MSU) crystals. Palmatine (PAL), a protoberberine alkaloid, has been proven to possess compelling health-beneficial activities. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of PAL on LPS plus MSU crystal-stimulated gouty arthritis in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were primed with LPS and then stimulated with MSU crystal in the presence or absence of PAL. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress-related biomarkers and signal pathway key targets were determined by ELISA kit, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR, respectively. In addition, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of PAL on MSU-induced arthritis mice were also evaluated. RESULTS: The results indicated that PAL (20, 40 and 80 μM) dose-dependently decreased the mRNA expression and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-18 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)). The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) were remarkably enhanced, while the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was reduced. Western blot analysis revealed that PAL appreciably inhibited NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathways through inhibiting the phosphorylation of p-65 and IκBα, blocking the expression of NLRP3, ASC, IL-1β and Caspase-1, as well as enhancing the antioxidant protein expression of Nrf2 and HO-1. In vivo, PAL attenuated MSU-induced inflammation in gouty arthritis, as evidenced by mitigating the joint swelling, and decreasing the productions of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-α and MDA, while enhancing the levels of SOD and GSH. Moreover, PAL further attenuated the infiltration of neutrophils into joint synovitis. CONCLUSION: PAL protected against MSU-induced inflammation and oxidative stress via regulating the NF-κB/NLRP3 and Nrf2 pathways. PAL may represent a potential candidate for the treatment of gouty arthritis.",

The metabolites of PAL were believed to contribute significantly to its outstanding biological activities. 8-Oxypalmatine (OPAL), a liver-mediated oxidative metabolite of PAL, has been firstly identified in the present work. We aimed to comparatively investigate the potential effect and mechanism of OPAL and PAL on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in Balb/c mice. Results indicated that OPAL and PAL effectively mitigated clinical manifestations, DAI scores and pathological damage compared with the model group. Moreover, treatment with OPAL and PAL effectively mitigated oxidative stress markers and inflammatory mediators in colon. Additionally, OPAL and PAL significantly activated the Nrf2 pathway, while substantially suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, OPAL showed superior anti-colitis effect to PAL, which was similar to the positive drug mesalazine with much smaller dosage. These findings suggested that OPAL exerted appreciable protective effect on DSS-induced colitis, at least in part, via activating Nrf2 pathway and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome. OPAL might have the potential to be further developed into a promising candidate for the treatment of UC.",

Here we reported that PAL alleviated LPS-induced acute lung injury and attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration especially neutrophils. Moreover, PAL also attenuated the production of TNF-α, CXCL-1, CXCL-2 and nitric oxide in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, PAL remarkably reduced LPS-induced expression of TNF-α, CXCL-1 and CXCL-2 in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs). Treatment with PAL inhibited the phosphorylation and interaction of TAK1/TAB1, which in turn attenuated the p38 MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways in BMDMs. Our results indicated that PAL ameliorated LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting macrophage activation through inhibiting NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways, suggesting that PAL has anti-inflammation effect on ALI.",

Circulating tumor cells play a key role in the metastatic spread of breast cancer to the lungs via the lymphatic or circulatory system. Palmatine is a protoberberine alkaloid, identified as an active component of traditional African herbal preparations. Palmatine has antimetastatic and antiproliferative effects. The inhibitory activity of palmatine on the metastatic colonization of triple negative breast cancer cells in the lungs was investigated in this study. Methods: 4T1 triple breast cancer cells were transplanted synergically to the thoracic duct of the female balb/c mice via the lymphatic system. Palmatine 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg were administered for 28 days. The lungs were analyzed for levels of arterial blood gas, histological damage, immunohistochemical expression of the metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) and tumor suppressor p53 (p53). Results: Administering palmatine 1-10 mg/kg dose dependently improved hypoxemia, ameliorated metastasis associated lung injury; histology score of 3.33 ± 0.33, 1.67 ± 0.33, 1.33 ± 0.33, decreased lung MTA1 (2.19 ± 0.12, 1.83 ± 0.04, 1.84 ± 0.05) and increased p53 expression (1.99 ± 0.06, 2.27 ± 0.12, 2.34 ± 0.12) respectively. Conclusion: Palmatine preserved lung morphology and demonstrated therapeutic potential in aiding the treatment of lung metastasis."

However, MSI2-engaged mRNAs are not well profiled, and no MSI2-dependent antagonist is available so far. In the study, we created MSI2 knockout cancer cells and demonstrated that MSI2 is required for the survival of colorectal cancer HCT116 cells but not non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells. In addition, the global profiling of the transcriptome and proteomics of MSI2 knockout colorectal cells revealed 38 candidate MSI2-targeted genes. In a loss-rescue screening, palmatine was identified as a functional MSI2 antagonist inhibiting the MSI2-dependent growth of colorectal cancer cells. Finally, we confirmed that palmatine is directly bound to MSI2 at its C-terminal. Our findings not only indicated MSI2 as a promising therapeutic target of colorectal cancer but also provided a small molecule palmatine as a direct and functional MSI2 antagonist for cancer therapy."

Our study shows that PLT administration could reduce myocardial injury and improve cardiac dysfunction in DOX-treated mice.

The aim of our study was to isolate PLT from the roots of Berberis cretica and investigate its cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects in vitro alone and in combination with doxorubicine (DOX) using human ER+/HER2- breast cancer cell lines. The alkaloid was purified by column chromatography filled with silica gel NP and Sephadex LH-20 resin developed in the mixture of methanol: water (50:50 v/v) that provided high-purity alkaloid for bioactivity studies. The purity of the alkaloid was confirmed by high resolution mass measurement and MS/MS fragmentation analysis in the HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS-based analysis. It was found that PLT treatment inhibited the viability and proliferation of breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner as demonstrated by MTT and BrdU assays. PLT showed a quite similar growth inhibition on breast cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 5.126 to 5.805 µg/mL. In contrast, growth of normal human breast epithelial cells was not affected by PLT. The growth inhibitory activity of PLT was related to the induction of apoptosis, as determined by Annexin V/PI staining. Moreover, PLT sensitized breast cancer cells to DOX. Isobolographic analysis revealed synergistic and additive interactions between studied agents. Our studies suggest that PLT can be a potential candidate agent for preventing and treating breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Palmatine is a naturally occurring isoquinoline alkaloid that has been reported to display neuroprotective effects against amyloid-β- (Aβ-) induced neurotoxicity. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective activities of palmatine remain poorly characterized in vivo. We employed transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models containing human Aβ 1-42 to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of palmatine-mediated neuroprotection. Treatment with palmatine significantly delayed the paralytic process and reduced the elevated reactive oxygen species levels in Aβ-transgenic C. elegans. In addition, it increased oxidative stress resistance without affecting the lifespan of wild-type C. elegans. Pathway analysis suggested that the differentially expressed genes were related mainly to aging, detoxification, and lipid metabolism. Real-time PCR indicated that resistance-related genes such as sod-3 and shsp were significantly upregulated, while the lipid metabolism-related gene fat-5 was downregulated. Further studies demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of palmatine on Aβ toxicity were attributable to the free radical-scavenging capacity and that the upregulated expression of resistance-related genes, especially shsp, whose expression was regulated by HSF-1, played crucial roles in protecting cells from Aβ-induced toxicity. The research showed that there were significantly fewer Aβ deposits in transgenic CL2006 nematodes treated with palmatine than in control nematodes. In addition, our study found that Aβ-induced toxicity was accompanied by dysregulation of lipid metabolism, leading to excessive fat accumulation in Aβ-transgenic CL4176 nematodes. The alleviation of lipid disorder by palmatine should be attributed not only to the reduction in fat synthesis but also to the inhibition of Aβ aggregation and toxicity, which jointly maintained metabolic homeostasis. This study provides new insights into the in vivo neuroprotective effects of palmatine against Aβ aggregation and toxicity and provides valuable targets for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

This research applied the chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-ION) approach to induce an animal model of TN in rats. The mechanical pain threshold of each group of rats was determined postoperatively; the expression of P2X7 receptor in trigeminal ganglion (TG) was assessed by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence and Western blot; and the changes of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in serum of rats were detected by ELISA. The results showed that the administration of palmatine in the TN rats could reduce the mechanical pain threshold, significantly decrease the expression of P2X7 receptor in TG, and lower the serum concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α, compared to the sham group. In addition, the phosphorylation level of p38 in TG of TN rats was significantly decreased after treatment with palmatine. Likewise, inhibition of P2X7 expression by shRNA treatment could effectively counteract the adversary changes of pain sensitivity, IL-1β and TNF-α production, and p38 phosphorylation in TN rats. Our data suggest that palmatine may alleviate mechanical facial pain in TN rats possibly by reducing the expression of P2X7 receptor in TG of TN rats, which may be attributable to inhibiting p38 phosphorylation and reducing the release of IL-1β and TNF-α."

In the present study, a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model was used to mimic ischemic stroke and cerebral I/R injury in mice. Our study demonstrated that PAL treatment ameliorated cerebral I/R injury by decreasing infarct volume, neurological scores, and brain water content. PAL administration attenuated oxidative stress, the inflammatory response, and neuronal apoptosis in mice after cerebral I/R injury. In addition, PAL treatment also decreases hypoxia and reperfusion- (H/R-) induced neuronal injury by reducing oxidative stress, the inflammatory response, and neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of PAL were associated with the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, and Nrf2 knockdown offsets PAL-mediated antioxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to investigate the ameliorative effects of Palmatine (Pal) on Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) induced chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). METHOD: Body function, serum biochemical indicators and histopathology were used to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of Pal on CAG rats. The target genes expression levels were verified and assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Moreover, UPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis based on urine and serum was performed to identify the potential metabolites in the pathological process of CAG induced by H. pylori. Metabolic pathway analysis was performed to elucidate the metabolic network associated with Pal treatment of CAG. RESULTS: Pal (10, 20, 40 mg/kg/day) significantly restored the body function of CAG rats, reduced the serum biochemical indicators, and maintained the integrity of the gastric mucosal epithelial barrier while alleviated gastric histological damage. Metabolomics analysis shows that the therapeutic effect of Pal on CAG involves 10 metabolites and 10 metabolic pathways, of which the Taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, Glycerophospholipid metabolism and Pentose and glucuronate interconversions are closely related to the gastrointestinal protection of Pal, and these metabolic pathways crosstalk with each other due to the internet hub of citric acid cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolomics was used for the first time to identify potential biomarkers of CAG and to illuminate the therapeutic mechanism of Pal on CAG induced by H. pylori. The results provided a new insight for further research on CAG treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a representative prediabetes characterized by defective glucose homeostasis, and palmatine (PAL) is a natural isoquinoline alkaloid with multiple pharmacological effects. Our study aims to investigate the therapeutic effect of PAL on the impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish an IGT model with high fat diet (HFD). Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and further biochemical analysis were conducted to determine the effect of PAL on glucose intolerance in vivo. Molecular details were clarified in a cellular model of IGT induced by Palmitate (PA) on INS-1 cells. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated a relief of IGT with improved insulin resistance in HFD induced rats after PAL treatment. Besides, promoted pancreas islets function was validated with significantly increased β cell mass after the treatment of PAL. We further found out that PAL could alleviate the β cell apoptosis that accounts for β cell mass loss in IGT model. Moreover, MAPK signaling was investigated in vivo and vitro with the discovery that PAL regulated the MAPK signaling by restricting the ERK and JNK cascades. The insulin secretion assay indicated that PAL significantly promoted the defective insulin secretion in PA-induced INS-1 cells via JNK rather than ERK signaling. Furthermore, PAL treatment was determined to significantly suppress β cell apoptosis in PA-induced cells. We thus thought that PAL promoted the PA-induced impaired insulin release by inhibiting the β cell apoptosis and JNK signaling in vitro. CONCLUSION: In summary, PAL ameliorates HFD-induced IGT with novel mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels) which is due to the destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. It is associated with oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The plant alkaloid Palmatine has been previously reported to possess antidiabetic and antioxidant properties as well as other protective properties against kidney and liver tissue damage. OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the ability of Palmatine to reduce the up-regulation of chaperone proteins Glucose Regulatory Protein 78 (GRP78), and Calreticulin (CALR) protein in a Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model. METHODS: Streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes in Sprague Dawley rats treated with 2mg/kg of Palmatine for 12 weeks after the elevation of plasma glucose levels above 11mmol/L post-STZ administration. Proteins were extracted from the pancreas after treatment and Two-Dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), PDQuest 2-D analysis software genomic solutions and mass spectrometer were used to analyze differentially expressed protein. Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS), Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) was used for protein identification. RESULTS: There was an up-regulation of the expression of chaperone proteins CALR and GRP78 and down-regulation of the expression of antioxidant and protection proteins peroxidoxin 4 (Prdx4), protein disulfide isomerase (PDIA2/3), Glutathione-S-Transferase (GSTs), and Serum Albumin (ALB) in non-diabetic rats. Palmatine treatment down-regulated the expression of chaperone proteins CALR and GRP78 and up-regulated the expression of Prdx4, PDIA2/3, GST, and ALB. CONCLUSION: Palmatine may have activated antioxidant proteins, which protected the cells against reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic stress. The result is in consonance with our previous report on Palmatine.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Palmatine, a biologically active isoquinoline alkaloid, possesses multiple pharmaceutical activities against mucosal infection and inflammation. OBJECTIVE: There are no reports about the influence of palmatine on uterine mucosal epithelial cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used proteomics to analyse differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in goat endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 μg/mL, the dosage can induce inflammatory response, according to our previous study) for 12 h and then treated with palmatine (80 μg/mL) for 8 h; the dosage was selected based on MTT assay. The EECs without any treatment were used as controls. Every group was treated in triplicate. RESULTS: A total of 428 DEPs in LPS-stimulated group and 486 DEPs in the palmatine-treated group were identified. Functional annotation analysis showed that palmatine mainly regulated the protein expression of structural molecules involved in the response to stimuli. Pathway analysis showed that cell adhesion molecule (CaM) pathways were most significant enriched due to palmatine treatment. Junction adhesion molecule 1 (JAM1), nectin 1 (NECT1) and cadherin 5 (CDH5), which play important roles in the transepithelial migration (TEpM) of leukocytes, were significantly downregulated by palmatine. Meanwhile, other proteins essential to the maintenance of cell adhesion and those that facilitate leukocyte migration were upregulated after palmatine treatment. Discussion and conclusions: The results suggested that palmatine regulates the expression of CaMs to affect TEpM during uterine mucosal inflammation and provides novel insight to understanding and developing palmatine pharmacology. Palmatine is a promising drug for treatment of mucosal inflammation.",

The results showed that PAL significantly inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo without significant effect on non-tumorigenic colon cells. Target prediction and clinical sample database analysis suggested that PAL may contribute to colon cancer cells phase arrest and apoptosis by targeting aurora kinase A (AURKA). Inhibition and overexpression of AURKA proved that PAL induces G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells by targeting AURKA. Moreover, PAL promoted intracellular Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). PAL reduced the levels of AURKA, Bcl-xl and Bcl2 proteins, and promoted the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins P53, P73, Caspase3 and Caspase9, as well as the increase of cytochrome c (cyt. c) in cell lysates in vitro and in vivo. Together, our study confirmed that PAL induced G2/M phase arrest and mitochondrial-associated pathway apoptosis in colon cancer cells by targeting AURKA. PAL may provide a novel solution for the treatment of colon cancer by serving as a new AURKA inhibitor.",

Here, we discovered that a natural isoquinoline alkaloid palmatine extracted from traditional Chinese medicinal plants effectively inhibited the activity of PMQR proteins QnrS and AAC(6')-Ib-cr. METHODS: In total 120 clinical ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) were screened for the presence of qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr by PCR. Recombinant E. coli that produced QnrS or AAC(6')-Ib-cr proteins were constructed and the correct expression was confirmed by MALDI/TOF MS analysis and SDS-PAGE. A minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) assay, growth curve assay and time-kill assay were conducted to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of palmatine and the combination of palmatine and ciprofloxacin. Cytotoxicity assays and mouse thigh infection model were used to evaluate the in vivo synergies. Molecular docking, gyrase supercoiling assay and acetylation assay were used to clarify the mechanism of action. RESULTS: Palmatine effectively restored the activity of ciprofloxacin against qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr-positive E. coli strains in a synergistic manner in vitro. In addition, the combined therapy significantly reduced the bacterial burden in a mouse thigh infection model. Molecular docking revealed that palmatine bound at the functional large loop B of QnrS and Trp102Arg and Asp179Tyr in the binding pocket of AAC(6')-Ib-cr. Furthermore, interaction analysis confirmed that palmatine reduced the gyrase protective effect of QnrS and the acetylation effect of AAC(6')-Ib-cr. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that palmatine is a potential efficacious compound to restore PMQR-mediated ciprofloxacin resistance and warrants further preclinical evaluations."

In chronic pain conditions including TN, increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may enhance pain transmission. This study compares the effect of palmatine administration on the expression of BDNF and its receptor TrkB (tropomyosin receptor kinase B) in trigeminal ganglion cells of Sprague-Dawley rats in a sham versus TN model group. Within 14 days of surgery, the mechanical allodynia threshold of the TN group was significantly lower than that of the sham group, while the TN + palmatine group had a higher mechanical pain sensitivity threshold than the TN group (p < 0.05). Real-time quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence showed that BDNF and TrkB expression in the TN group was higher than that in the sham group, while palmatine treatment could reverse these changes. Western blotting showed that palmatine treatment could reduce the elevated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) in TN rats. Thus, the BDNF/TrkB pathway may be involved in the pain transmission process of TN, and palmatine treatment may reduce pain transmission by inhibiting the BDNF/TrkB pathway and suppressing ERK1/2 phosphorylation.",

      "abstract": "Trigeminal neuralgia is one of the most common of the neuropathic pains, and it can seriously influence patients' quality of life. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a type of nociceptive neurotransmitter that is expressed in neurons of the trigeminal ganglion and plays a major part in transmitting pain. The rat model of trigeminal neuralgia was established by causing a chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-ION). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=24) were randomly divided into a sham control group (sham, n=6), sham-treated with palmatine group (sham+palmatine, n=6), trigeminal nerve model group (TN, n=6), and trigeminal nerve treated with palmatine group (TN+palmatine, n=6). Fifteen days after the operation the mechanical response threshold was decreased in the TN group compared with the sham group. From postoperative day 7 to day 15, the mechanical response threshold in the TN+palmatine group significantly increased compared with the TN group. On postoperative day 15 the results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), immunohistochemical staining, and western blotting showed an obvious increase in expression of CGRP and its receptors, serum concentrations of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC) in the trigeminal ganglia of the TN group compared with the sham group, but these increases could be down-regulated by treatment with palmatine. Palmatine might therefore have therapeutic potential for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia by inhibiting the expression of CGRP and its receptors in trigeminal ganglia, suppressing the serum concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α, and decreasing the phosphorylation of PKC in the trigeminal ganglia of affected rats.",

On the other hand, palmatine only suppressed the growth of RD cells. Both of berberine and palmatine strongly inhibited the growth of tumorsphere of RD cells in three-dimensional culture. These results indicate that berberine derivatives have the potential of anti-tumor drugs for RMS therapy.Abbreviations: ARMS: alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma; ERMS: embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma; RMS: rhabdomyosarcoma.",

In addition, fractional excretion of Na and K were increased and urine flow rate and creatinine clearance were decreased in gentamicin group. Liver and renal tissues malondialdehyde were increased, and glutathione was decreased in GM group. TUNEL assay showed induction of apoptosis in liver and kidney in GM group. Palmatine treatment caused reduction in plasma AST, ALT, urine flow rate, creatinine clearance, renal and hapatic malondialdehyde, apoptosis and increase in renal and hapatic glutathione, fractional excretion of Na and K, plasma BUN and creatinine in contrast to GM group.

      "abstract": "Palmatine is a protoberberine alkaloid separated from several plants and application as an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial agent in the therapy of gastrointestinal and genitourinary disorder. Thus, the fast quantification of palmatine is important in clinic medical assays. Herein, we report simple, fast and sensitive colorimetric visualization and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) dual-mode detection of palmatine basing on bimetallic size tunable silver shell capped gold nanoparticles (Au@Ag NPs). Interesting, the best signals output for dual-mode sensing of palmatine were both 5 nm Ag shell thickness of Au@Ag NPs. Meanwhile, we found that the addition of NaHSO4 significantly improves the aggregating sensitivity of Au@Ag NPs to trace palmatine. Upon exposure to 0.1 μM level palmatine, NaHSO4-optimized Au@Ag NPs solution exhibits a highly sensitive color change from orange to green and rapid aggregation kinetics within the initial 5 min, which can directly be seen with the naked eye and monitored by UV-vis absorbance spectra. In addition, we measured palmatine by SERS with the excellent enhancement effect of Au@Ag NPs for further increase the sensitivity and selectivity. More importantly, other protoberberine alkaloids do not interfere with this dual-mode sensor due to the different interaction force between Au@Ag NPs and these alkaloids, and the applicability of the sensor is well demonstrated in real samples with satisfactory results. This provide a fast and simple assay for the rapid detection of palmatine in traditional Chinese medicine, the limit of detection (LOD) is 0.13 μM by the naked eye and 0.10 μM by UV-vis spectroscopy. Therefore, the size-tunable of NaHSO4-optimized Au@Ag NPs can be used not only as a naked-eye sensor of palmatine, but also as a highly selective SERS probe.",

Palmatine hydrochloride (PaH) is the alkaloid constituent of Fibraurea tinctoria Lour. The present study aims to investigate the antitumor effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with PaH (PaH-PDT) on human OSCC cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. The results indicate that PaH-PDT exhibited a potent phototoxic effect in cell proliferation and produced cell apoptosis. PaH-PDT increased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and decreased the CDK2 and Cyclin E1 protein level. In addition, PaH-PDT markedly increased the generation of intracellular ROS, which can be suppressed using the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Furthermore, PaH-PDT increased the expression of p53 protein in vitro and in vivo. In vivo experiments revealed that the PaH-PDT resulted in an effective inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, no obvious signs of side effects or a drop in body weight was observed. These results suggested that PaH was a promising sensitizer that can be combined with light to produce significant anti-tumor effects in oral squamous cell carcinoma via enhanced ROS production and up-regulated expression of p53.",

      "abstract": "Fungal infections caused by Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida [NAC] species are becoming a growing threat in immunodeficient population, people with long-term antibiotic treatment and patients enduring kinds of catheter intervention. The resistance to one or more than one conventional antifungal agents contributes greatly to the widespread propagation of Candida infections. The severity of fungal infection requires the discovery of novel antimycotics and the extensive application of combination strategy. In this study, a group of Candida standard and clinical strains including C. albicans as well as several NAC species were employed to evaluate the antifungal potentials of palmatine (PAL) alone and in combination with fluconazole (FLC)/itraconazole (ITR) by microdilution method, checkerboard assay, gram staining, spot assay, and rhodamine 6G efflux test. Subsequently, the expressions of transporter-related genes, namely CDR1, CDR2, MDR1, and FLU1 for C. albicans, CDR1 and MDR1 for Candida tropicalis and Candida parapsilosis, ABC1 and ABC2 for Candida krusei, CDR1, CDR2, and SNQ2 for Candida glabrata were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The susceptibility test showed that PAL presented strong synergism with FLC and ITR with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) in a range of 0.0049-0.75 for PAL+FLC and 0.0059-0.3125 for PAL+ITR in planktonic cells, 0.125-0.375 for PAL+FLC and 0.0938-0.3125 for PAL+ITR in biofilms. The susceptibility results were also confirmed by gram staining and spot assay. After combinations, a vast quantity of rhodamine 6G could not be pumped out as considerably intracellular red fluorescence was accumulated. Meanwhile, the expressions of efflux-associated genes were evaluated and presented varying degrees of inhibition. These results indicated that PAL was a decent antifungal synergist to promote the antifungal efficacy of azoles (such as FLC and ITR), and the underlying antifungal mechanism might be linked with the inhibition of efflux pumps and the elevation of intracellular drug content."

Here we examined the therapeutic effects of an isoquinoline alkaloid, Palmatine (Pal), on mice experimental colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and explored underlying mechanisms. Colitis was induced in BALB/c mice by administering 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. Pal (50 and 100 mg kg-1) and the positive drug Sulfasalazine (SASP, 200 mg kg-1) were orally administered for 7 days. Disease activity index (DAI) was evaluated on day 8, and colonic tissues were collected for biochemistry analysis. The fecal microbiota was characterized by high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing. And plasma metabolic changes were detected by UPLC-MS. Our results showed that Pal treatment significantly reduced DAI scores and ameliorated colonic injury in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Mucosal integrity was improved and cell apoptosis was inhibited. Moreover, gut microbiota analysis showed that mice received Pal-treatment have higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, but reduced amount of Proteobacteria. Moreover, Pal not only suppressed tryptophan catabolism in plasma, but also decreased the protein expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1, the rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan catabolism) in colon tissue. This is consolidated by molecular docking, which suggested that Pal is a potent IDO-1 inhibitor. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Pal ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by mitigating colonic injury, preventing gut microbiota dysbiosis, and regulating tryptophan catabolism, which indicated that Pal has great therapeutic potential for colitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder which is characterized by the deposits of intra-cellular tau protein and extra-cellular amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in the human brain. Understanding the mechanism of protein aggregation and finding compounds that are capable of inhibiting its aggregation is considered to be highly important for disease therapy. METHODS: We used an in vitro High-Throughput Screening for the identification of potent inhibitors of tau aggregation using a proxy model; a highly aggregation-prone hexapeptide fragment 306VQIVYK311 derived from tau. Using ThS fluorescence assay we screened a library of 2401 FDA approved, bio-active and natural compounds in attempt to find molecules which can efficiently modulate tau aggregation. RESULTS: Among the screened compounds, palmatine chloride (PC) alkaloid was able to dramatically reduce the aggregation propensity of PHF6 at sub-molar concentrations. PC was also able to disassemble preformed aggregates of PHF6 and reduce the amyloid content in a dose-dependent manner. Insights obtained from MD simulation showed that PC interacted with the key residues of PHF6 responsible for β-sheet formation, which could likely be the mechanism of inhibition and disassembly. Furthermore, PC could effectively inhibit the aggregation of full-length tau and disassemble preformed aggregates. CONCLUSIONS: We found that PC possesses \"dual functionality\" towards PHF6 and full-length tau, i.e. inhibit their aggregation and disassemble pre-formed fibrils. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The \"dual functionality\" of PC is valuable as a disease modifying strategy for AD, and other tauopathies, by inhibiting their progress and reducing the effect of fibrils already present in the brain.",

The inhibition of telomerase enzyme has immense potential since it is over expressed in most cancer cells. Interaction of palmatine, an antitumor alkaloid, to parallel G-quadruplex DNA, [d(TTGGGGT)]4 and [d(TTAGGGT)]4, has been investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), fluorescence and Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Titrations were monitored by 1H and 31P NMR spectra and solution structure of palmatine-[d(TTGGGGT)]4 complex was obtained by restrained Molecular Dynamics (rMD) simulations using distance restraints from 2D NOESY spectra. Thermal stabilization of DNA was determined by CD, 1H NMR and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Binding of palmatine induces 98% enhancement of fluorescence accompanied by blue shift ∼8 nm. CD spectral bands of DNA show minor changes. Diffusion NMR studies confirm formation of a stable complex. Proton NMR signals of palmatine shift upfield upon binding and NOE cross peaks of H10, H3, H28, 5OCH3 protons with T2, A3/G3, G6 and T7 residues reveal dual recognition sites in both G-quadruplex DNA sequences, resulting in thermal stabilization of G-quadruplex by ∼13-17 °C. Restrained molecular dynamics simulations using NOE distance restraints for 2:1 palmatine-[d(TTGGGGT)]4 complex reveal end-stacking of palmatine at G6pT7 step and groove binding along T2pG3 step. Binding to [d(TTAGGGT)]4 takes place at T2pA3pG4 and G6pT7 steps. Structural features of molecular recognition of two different G-quadruplex DNA sequences by palmatine have relevance in rational drug development for anti-cancer therapy.",

P2X7 receptors play an important role in the transmission of nociceptive signal and are associated with depressive illness. In the study, the hyperalgesia, allodynia and depressive behaviours of rats with comorbidity of DNP and DP were confirmed by the thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) test, mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) test, sucrose preference test (SPT), immobility time of forced swimming test (IMFST) and open-field test (OFT). The change in expression of the P2X7 receptor of the hippocampus was observed through RT-PCR, qPCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining methods The results showed that palmatine treatment can alleviate the hyperalgesia, allodynia and depressive behaviours of rats with comorbidity of DNP and DP. Meanwhile, the expression of P2X7 receptors, GFAP, TNF-α and IL-1β in the hippocampus of the rats with comorbidity of DNP and DP was significantly increased compared with the control rats, and palmatine treatment could decrease the expression. Furthermore, the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the hippocampus of rats with DNP and DP was decreased noticeably by palmatine treatment. The results of this study suggest that palmatine can alleviate the comorbidity of DNP and DP by inhibiting the expression of P2X7 receptors in the hippocampus, and its action may be related to suppression of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the release of TNF-α and IL-1β in the hippocampus.",

Rat hypertrophy model was established by intraperitoneal isoproterenol (ISO) injection. The hypertrophy was evaluated with cardiac hypertrophic parameters, hemodynamic parameters, lipid profile, and non-specific cardiac markers. The animals were intraperitoneally administrated with either palmatine or vehicle. The relative expressions of ANP, BNP, HDAC2, HDAC5, KLF4, and INPP5F transcripts were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The relative protein levels of HDAC2, HDAC5, KLF4, and INPP5F were analyzed by immunoblotting. Palmatine treatment significantly attenuated ISO-induced hypertrophy in rats and elicited remarkable repressions in ANP, BNP, and HDAC2 transcriptions but not HDAC5.

Hence, in this study we report a simple preparation of poly-l-lysine (PLL) electro-polymerized on the surface of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNT) for electrochemical detection of palmatine content in human serum and urine samples. The active amino group of PLL plays a vital role towards the oxidation palmatine and exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity. Under optimum conditions, the prepared f-MWCNT/PLL composite shows a wide linear response range over the palmatine concentration ranging from 0.5µM to 425µM, and a detection limit (LOD) of 0.12µM based on S/N =3 (signal to noise ratio). The real time monitoring of palmatine content in serum and urine samples displays an appropriate recoveries and excellent performance for the practical analysis. The advantage of this developed system was simple, higher electrocatalytic activity, long-term stability and low cost. We hope that the prepared composite opens a new way for the fabrication of different biosensors in the field of biomedical application.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of palmatine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs), and the possible molecular mechanisms. Palmatine cell toxicity was determined by MTT assay, and the production of inflammatory cytokine in the cultured medium was measured with ELISA, qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Our results showed that palmatine treatment inhibited the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, nitric oxide (NO), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-2. Furthermore, palmatine enhanced the secretion of prostaglandins E2 (PGE2) and IL-10. Palmatine significantly down-regulated the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), Toll/interleukin 1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-β (TICAM, TRIF) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in LPS stimulated gEECs, but did not alter the production of MyD88. In conclusion, palmatine inhibits TRIF-dependent NF-κB pathway to reduce LPS-induced inflammatory responses in goat endometrial epithelial cells.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we evaluated the anti-Helicobacter pylori activity and the possible inhibitory effect on its associated urease by Palmatine (Pal) from Coptis chinensis, and explored the potential underlying mechanism. Results indicated that Pal exerted inhibitory effect on four tested H. pylori strains (ATCC 43504, NCTC 26695, SS1 and ICDC 111001) by the agar dilution test with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 100 to 200 μg/mL under neutral environment (pH 7.4), and from 75 to 100 μg/mL under acidic conditions (pH 5.3), respectively. Pal was observed to significantly inhibit both H. pylori urease (HPU) and jack bean urease (JBU) in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 0.53 ± 0.01 mM and 0.03 ± 0.00 mM, respectively, as compared with acetohydroxamic acid, a well-known urease inhibitor (0.07 ± 0.01 mM for HPU and 0.02 ± 0.00 mM for JBU, respectively). Kinetic analyses showed that the type of urease inhibition by Pal was noncompetitive for both HPU and JBU. Higher effectiveness of thiol protectors against urease inhibition than the competitive Ni2+ binding inhibitors was observed, indicating the essential role of the active-site sulfhydryl group in the urease inhibition by Pal. DTT reactivation assay indicated that the inhibition on the two ureases was reversible, further supporting that sulfhydryl group should be obligatory for urease inhibition by Pal. Furthermore, molecular docking study indicated that Pal interacted with the important sulfhydryl groups and inhibited the active enzymatic conformation through N-H ∙ π interaction, but did not interact with the active site Ni2+. Taken together, Pal was an effective inhibitor of H. pylori and its urease targeting the sulfhydryl groups, representing a promising candidate as novel urease inhibitor. This investigation also gave additional scientific support to the use of C. chinensis to treat H. pylori-related gastrointestinal diseases in traditional Chinese medicine. Pal might be a potentially beneficial therapy for gastritis and peptic ulcers induced by H. pylori infection and other urease-related diseases.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the gastroprotective activity and possible underlying mechanisms of palmatine against acetic acid-induced gastric ulcers in rats. Palmatine was administered orally for 7 consecutive days to treat ulcers. The ulcer area, ulcer inhibition rate, histological section, platelet-activating factor (PAF) level in serum, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level in gastric tissue, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level in the brain and norepinephrine (NE) level in the adrenal glands were analyzed. Histological results showed that the ulcer areas were significantly decreased by both doses of palmatine (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) compared with the model group, and the ulcer inhibition rates were 51.42% and 60.92%, respectively. Palmatine treatment markedly increased the level of PGE2 and decreased PAF, compared with the model group; however, it had no significant effect on 5-HT and NE levels. The results indicated that palmatine may exert a gastroprotective effect against gastric ulcers, and the mechanisms might be associated with the anti-inflammatory status and the protection of gastric mucosa via increasing PGE2 and decreasing PAF rather than neurohumoral regulation through 5-HT and NE. Thus, palmatine is a potential drug for treatment of gastric ulcers.",

PM-loaded CLEs (PM-CLEs) were prepared through emulsifying/high-pressure homogenisation and characterised by particle size, ζ potential and morphology. The resulting PM-CLEs possessed a particle size of 192 nm and ζ potential of 45 mV around. In vitro release illustrated that PM was released less from CLEs. Corneal bioadhesion test showed that PM-CLEs exhibited an enhanced ocular residence time. Improved anti-infective activity was achieved in the model of fungus-induced keratitis. Furthermore, PM-CLEs demonstrated predominant cellular uptake and internalisation in the corneal epithelial cells. These results provide proof of concept that CLEs are promising bioadhesive carriers for ophthalmic delivery of PM.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tinospora sagittata (Oliv.) Gagnep. var. craveniana (S.Y.Hu) Lo (TSG) is a traditional Chinese herb that has been used for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection and has anti-bacterial and anti-ulcer activity. Our study investigated the bactericidal effects of TSG and its major component, palmatine, against a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strain isolated from pig and the standard strain H. pylori SS1 in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: H. pylori was isolated from pig and named H. pylori SCYA201401. For in vitro experiments, the inhibitory activity of TSG and palmatine against H. pylori SCYA201401 and H. pylori SS1 were tested by use of the agar cup diffusion technique. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined from the absence of H. pylori colonies on agar plates. Time-kill curves were used to evaluate bactericidal activity; the average number of colonies was calculated at 0 to 48 h after liquid incubation, with concentrations of drugs at 0.5, 1, and 2 × MIC. For in vivo experiments, H. pylori SCYA201401-infected mice were randomly divided into TSG, palmatine, triple therapy (omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin), blank control, and model groups. The eradication ratios were determined by use of rapid urease tests and bacterial culture. RESULTS: In vitro, the MIC and MBC of TSG against H. pylori SCYA201401 and SS1 were both 6250 μg/mL, whereas palmatine against H. pylori SCYA201401 was 6.25 μg/mL and against H. pylori SS1 was 3.12 μg/mL. The time-kill curves showed a dose-dependent, progressive decline in the numbers of viable bacteria up to 40 h. In vivo, the eradication ratios in the TSG and palmatine groups of mice were 80 and 50 % compared with 70 % in the triple-therapy group. CONCLUSION: TSG and its major component, palmatine, have bactericidal activity against H. pylori in vitro and in vivo. The possibility that TSG or palmatine can be effective in the treatment of human and animals H. pylori infection deserves investigation.",

The present study aims to investigate the effect of photodynamic action of palmatine hydrochloride (PaH), a naturally occurring photosensitizer isolated from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), on apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Firstly, cellular uptake of PaH in MCF-7 cells was measured and the cytotoxicity of PaH itself on breast cancer MCF-7 cells was estimated using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Subcellular localization of PaH in MCF-7 cells was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). For photodynamic treatment, MCF-7 cells were incubated with PaH and then irradiated by visible light (470nm) from a LED light source. Photocytotoxicity was investigated 24h after photodynamic treatment using MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed 18h after photodynamic treatment using flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI staining. Nuclear was stained using Hoechst 33342 and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was studied by measuring the fluorescence of 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) using a flow cytometry. Results showed that PaH treatment alone had no or minimum cytotoxicity to MCF-7 cells after incubation for 24h in the dark. After incubation for 40min, the cellular uptake of PaH reached to the maximum, and PaH mainly located in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum of MCF-7 cells. Photodynamic treatment of PaH demonstrated a significant photocytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells, induced remarkable cell apoptosis and significantly increased intracellular ROS level. Our findings demonstrated that PaH as a naturally occurring photosensitizer induced cell apoptosis and significantly killed MCF-7 cells.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a serious public health problem characterized by low bone density and deterioration of the bone microarchitecture. Current treatment options target either osteoclast resorption or osteoblast formation. It has been reported that berberine, a close structural analog of palmatine, inhibited bone loss in an osteoporosis model. In this study, osseous metabolism was observed in vitro with osteoclast bone resorbing cells. We proved that mouse preosteoclastic cell line (RAW 264.7) has a higher sensitivity to palmatine than mouse osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1); the cell survival rates significantly decreased at 40 μM palmatine. The NO2 (-) level, a metabolic product of nitric monoxide (NO), and iNOS mRNA expression, an osteoclast with NO induced enzyme, also increased with higher dosage of palmatine. Furthermore, it was recognized that the cell viability decrease from palmatine was caused by apoptosis rather than necrosis. Additionally, osteoclast apoptosis from palmatine did not occur when iNOS was inhibited with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (pan NOS inhibitor). These results indicate that palmatine plays an important role in osteoclast apoptosis via the NOS system. Hence, palmatine could be considered as a viable pharmaceutical candidate for osteoporosis bone resorption inhibitor."

The present study aims to evaluate the effect of PaH as a new photosensitizer on colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells upon light irradiation. Firstly, the absorption and fluorescence spectra of PaH were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer and RF-1500PC spectrophotometer, respectively. Singlet oxygen ((1)O2) production of PaH was determined using 1, 3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF). Dark toxicity of PaH was estimated using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cellular uptake of PaH in HT-29 cells was detected at different time intervals. Subellular localization of PaH in HT-29 cells was observed using confocal laser fluorescence microscopy. For photodynamic treatment, HT-29 cells were incubated with PaH and then irradiated by visible light (470nm) from a LED light source. Photocytotoxicity was investigated 24h after photodynamic treatment using MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was observed 18h after photodynamic treatment using a flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI staining. Results showed that PaH has an absorption peak in the visible region from 400nm to 500nm and a fluorescence emission peak at 406nm with an excitation wavelength of 365nm. PaH was activated by the 470nm visible light from a LED light source to produce (1)O2. Dark toxicity showed that PaH alone treatment had no cytotoxicity to HT-29 cancer cells and NIH-3T3 normal cells after incubation for 24h. After incubation for 40min, the cellular uptake of PaH reached to the maximum and PaH was located in mitochondria. Photodynamic treatment of PaH demonstrated a significant photocytotoxicity on HT-29 cells. The rate of cell death increased significantly in a PaH concentration-dependent and light dose-dependent manner. Further evaluation revealed that the early and late apoptotic rate of HT-29 cells increased remarkably up to 21.54% and 5.39% after photodynamic treatment of PaH at the concentration of 5μM and energy density of 10.8J/cm(2). Our findings demonstrated that PaH as a naturally occurring photosensitizer has potential in photodynamic therapy on colon adenocarcinoma.",

      "abstract": "Mahonia bealei is a Chinese folk medicine used to treat various ailments, in particular gastrointestinal inflammation‑related illnesses, and palmatine is one of its active constituents. In this study, ApcMin/+ mice, a genetically engineered model, were used to investigate the effects of palmatine on the initiation and progression of gut inflammation and tumorigenesis enhanced by a high‑fat diet. The in vitro antiproliferation and anti‑inflammation effects of palmatine were evaluated on HT‑29 and SW‑480 human colorectal cancer cell lines. The concentration‑related antiproliferative effects of palmatine on both cell lines (P<0.01) were observed. Palmatine significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide‑induced increase in cytokine interleukin (IL)‑8 levels in the HT‑29 cells (P<0.01). In the in vivo studies with ApcMin/+ mice, after 10 or 20 mg/kg/day oral palmatine treatment, tumor numbers were significantly reduced in the small intestine and colon in a dose‑dependent manner (P<0.01 compared with the model group). The results were supported by tumor distribution data, body weight changes and organ index. The effect on survival was also dose‑dependent. Both the low‑ and high‑dose palmatine treatments significantly increased the life span of the mice (P<0.01). The gut histology from the model group showed a prominent adenomatous change along with inflammatory lesions. With palmatine treatment, however, the dysplastic changes were greatly reduced in the small intestine and colon tissue. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of interleukin (IL)‑1α, IL1‑β, IL‑8, granulocyte‑colony stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage colony‑stimulating factor in the gut tissue showed that these inflammatory cytokines were reduced significantly following treatment (all P<0.01); serum cytokine levels were also decreased. Data suggests that palmatine has a clinical value in colorectal cancer therapeutics, and this action is likely linked to the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines.",

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the effect of palmatine (Pal) in a rabbit osteoarthritis (OA) model in vivo and rabbit interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-stimulated chondrocytes in vitro. Appropriate concentrations of Pal were identified by the MTT assay and used to preincubate IL-1β-induced chondrocytes, as well as an activator or inhibitor of Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, 3, and 13; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1; collagenase II; aggrecan; and the related molecules of the Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog signaling pathways were investigated. Protein expression was detected by Western blot analysis and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was examined by PCR analysis. Pal (0.3 mL, 100 mg/L) was injected into rabbit knee joints and histological examination, immunohistochemistry, and Mankin scoring of the articular cartilage were performed. Pal (10-100 mg/L) had no effect on chondrocyte viability, decreased the expression of the MMPs, and increased the synthesis of TIMP-1whereas collagenase II and aggrecan were inhibited by IL-1β. When the activator (Licl) and inhibitor (DKK-1) of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as well as the inhibitor (cyclopamine) of the Hedgehog signaling pathway were added, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was less inhibited by Pal, and a similar inhibitory effect of cyclopamine on the Hedgehog signaling pathway was evident. Additionally, Pal enhanced the effect of cyclopamine. The histological examination, immunohistochemistry and Mankin scoring also demonstrated the protective effect of Pal, and the inhibition of the Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways by Pal. Pal may be useful in the treatment of OA, in which its effect is likely mediated via the Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog signaling pathways.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first experimentaI set was designed to histologically and biochemically examine mice randomly divided into four groups: sham-operated, OVX, and OVX-palmatine intake groups (1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg). The second experimental set examined the influence of palmatine on osteoblast-like cells in vitro. RESULTS: Palmatine caused significant suppression of osteoclast numbers in tissues. In palmatine-treated mice, RANKL and OPG expression decreased. In the culture supernatant of MC3T3-E1 cells, RANKL and OPG levels were significantly reduced by palmatine addition. CONCLUSION: Palmatine may attenuate osteoclast differentiation through inhibition of RANKL and OPG expression by osteoblasts. Therefore, palmatine might be a candidate anti-resorptive agent for osteoporosis therapy.",

This study was conducted to evaluate the antifungal effects of berberine hydrochloride, palmatine hydrochloride, and a mixture of both substances against Microsporum canis in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of monomers and clotrimazole were determined using 1.5 % tryptic soy agar. The effects of these drugs on Microsporum canis growth was detected by determining dry weight. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to observe the effect of chemicals on cell ultrastructure. Differential mRNA expressions of eight genes of M. canis treated with berberine or palmatine or their combination at different time points were determined by real-time PCR. NADH enzyme concentration was also detected. Clinical evaluation via in-vivo antifungal assay was also performed. Skin histology PAS staining was also carried out. RESULTS: Results showed that MICs of berberine, palmatine and clotrimazole were 1, 1, and 0.015 mg/mL, respectively. No significant difference was observed among the growth curves of the three groups before 18 h was reached. TEM showed that these drugs could destroy the cell membrane and organelles of M. canis at different time points. After 30 h of incubation, relative mRNA expressions of the genes in the combined group were significantly higher than those in the other groups including the clotrimazole group (P < 0.05); Palmatine initially induced the mRNA up-regulation of PGAL4, FSH1, PQ-LRP, NADH1 and NDR in M. canis; by contrast, berberine maintained a high expression level of these genes to shorten fungal life cycle and eradicate M. canis. Clinical results showed that combined treatment was more effective than single administration of each monomer or clotrimazole. Hence, berberine mixed with palmatine significantly elicited antifungal activities and could be used to treat M. canis in rabbits. CONCLUSION: These results provide a comprehensive view of the mechanism of berberine and palmatine in anti-M. canis activity.",

The present aim was to investigate the hypolipidemic effect and mechanism of palmatine in hamsters fed with high-fat diet (HFD). PAL treatment decreased serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, as well as increased fecal excretion of TC and total bile acids (TBA) in hyperlipidemic hamsters. Furthermore, PAL treatment up-regulated low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) mRNA and protein expression and down-regulated apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT) mRNA and protein expression. These results demonstrated that PAL as a potential natural cholesterol lowering agent works by up-regulating LDLR and CYP7A1 mRNA and protein expression, down-regulating ASBT mRNA and protein expression, as well as enhancing fecal excretion of TC and TBA. The findings in our study suggest that palmatine could be a potential natural agent for treating hyperlipidemia.",

      "abstract": "Novel agents are desperately needed for improving the quality of life and 5-year survival to more than 30% for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Previously we showed that Nexrutine, Phellodendron amurense bark extract, inhibits prostate tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently using biochemical fractionation we identified butanol fraction contributes to the observed biological activities. We report here that palmatine, which is present in the butanol fraction, selectively inhibits growth of prostate cancer cells without significant effect on non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells. By screening receptor tyrosine kinases in a protein kinase array, we identified ribosomal protein S6, a downstream target of p70S6K and the Akt/mTOR signaling cascade as a potential target. We further show that palmatine treatment is associated with decreased activation of NFκB and its downstream target gene FLIP. These events led to inhibition of invasion. Similar results were obtained using parent extract Nexrutine (Nx) suggesting that palmatine either in the purified form or as one of the components in Nx is a potent cytotoxic agent with tumor invasion inhibitory properties. Synergistic inhibition of rpS6/NFκB/FLIP axis with palmatine may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of prostate cancer and possibly other malignancies with their constitutive activation. These data support a biological link between rpS6/NFκB/FLIP in mediating palmatine-induced inhibitory effects and warrants additional preclinical studies to test its therapeutic efficacy.",

Metabolic syndrome, which is accompanied by Qi and blood stasis, mainly arises from spleen deficiency in essence. There is limited information available for differences of pharmacokinetic properties of San-Huang formula between normal and metabolic syndrome rats. The present study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of berberine as well as palmatine in normal and metabolic syndrome rats following oral administration of San-Huang formula extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The animals were orally administered with San-Huang formula extract with the equivalent dose of 60.4 and 12.5mg/kg for berberine and palmatine, respectively. The blood samples were collected according to the time schedule. The concentrations of berberine and palmatine in rat plasma were determined by LC-ESI/MS. Various pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from the plasma concentration versus time data using non-compartmental methods. RESULTS: It was found that AUC0-t, Cmax, Vd and CL of berberine and palmatine in metabolic syndrome rats were significantly different (P<0.05) from normal rats. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that berberine and palmatine have higher uptake and slower elimination in the rats with metabolic syndrome, which suggests that the rate and extent of drug metabolism were altered in metabolic syndrome rats.",

      "abstract": "Osteoclasts are the only cell type capable of resorbing mineralized bone, and they act under the control of numerous cytokines produced by supporting cells such as osteoblasts and stromal cells. Among cytokines, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) was found to be a key osteoclastogenetic molecule that directly binds to its cognate receptor, RANK, on osteoclast precursor cells. In turn, RANKL, which is an essential factor for differentiation and activation of osteoclasts, is one of the major targets of anti-resorptive agents. In this study, we found that palmatine, an isoquinoline alkaloid originally isolated from Coptis chinensis, had an inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation and function in vitro. Palmatine inhibited osteoclast formation in the co-culture system with mouse bone marrow cells (BMC) and osteoblasts in the presence of 10 nM 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Palmatine did not affect osteoclast formation induced by RANKL in the BMC cultures. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that palmatine significantly inhibited the expression of 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced expression of RANKL mRNAs in stromal cells without loss of cell viability. Moreover, palmatine suppressed resorption pit formation by mature osteoclasts on dentin slices and induced disruption of actin ring formation in mature osteoclasts with an impact on cell viability. Taken together, these results suggest that palmatine attenuates osteoclast differentiation through inhibition of RANKL expression in osteoblast cells, and its inhibitory effect on bone resorption is due to its disruptive effect on actin rings in mature osteoclasts. Therefore, palmatine might be an ideal candidate as an anti-resorptive agent for the prevention and treatment of bone disorders such as osteoporosis.",

The test compound was administered at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, p.o., 36 h after alloxan injection (60 mg/kg, i.v.). The alloxan-induced diabetic mice showed significant reduction in blood glucose after treatment with the test compound by 52% as compared to the positive control glibenclamide (54%) and the diabetic control (27%).",

The present study examined the cytoprotective properties of palmatine on d(+)-galactosamine (GalN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced fulminant hepatic failure. Mice were intraperitoneally given GalN (700 mg/kg)/LPS (10 microg/kg). Palmatine (25, 50, 100, and 200mg/kg) was administered 1h before GalN/LPS. GalN/LPS increased the mortality and serum aminotransferase activities. These increases were attenuated by palmatine. GalN/LPS increased hepatic lipid peroxidation and decreased the contents of reduced glutathione. Palmatine did not affect the lipid peroxidation and glutathione content. GalN/LPS increased the circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10. Palmatine prevented the increase of serum TNF-alpha and augmented that of serum IL-10. GalN/LPS treatment also increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA expression in liver tissue. Palmatine decreased the TNF-alpha mRNA expression and increased the IL-10 mRNA expression. Palmatine attenuated the apoptosis of hepatocytes, as evidenced by the TUNEL method and capase-3 analysis. Our data suggest that palmatine alleviates GalN/LPS-induced liver injury by modulating the cytokine response and inhibiting apoptosis.",

These photosensitizers were bound to DNA by electrostatic force. Near-infrared luminescence measurement demonstrated that the photoexcited alkaloids can generate 1O2 only when the photosensitizers are bound to DNA. A fluorescence decay study showed significant enhancement of the lifetime of their photoexcited state with the DNA binding. A calculation study suggested that the electrostatic interaction with DNA inhibits the quenching of the photoexcited state of these alkaloids via intramolecular electron transfer, leading to the prolongation of the lifetime of their excited state. This effect should enhance their intersystem crossing and the yield of energy transfer to molecular oxygen. The results show that the electrostatic interaction with DNA significantly affects the 1O2 generation activity of a photosensitizer. In addition, this interaction may be applied to the control and the design of photosensitizers for medical applications such as photodynamic therapy.",

The rat urine samples were collected and purified through C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges, and then injected onto a reversed-phase C18 column with 60:40 (v/v) methanol/0.01% triethylamine solution (2 mM, adjusted to pH 3.5 with formic acid) as mobile phase and detected by on-line MS/MS. Identification of the metabolites and elucidation of their structures were performed by comparing changes in molecular masses (DeltaM), retention times and spectral patterns of product ions with those of the parent drug. As a result, six phase I metabolites, the parent drug palmatine and two phase II metabolites were identified in rat urine for the first time.",

      "abstract": "The mechanism of DNA damage by photoexcited alkaloids, berberine and palmatine, was examined using 32P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from human genes. Berberine and palmatine easily bind to DNA, leading to the formation of strong fluorescent complexes. The binding constants of berberine and palmatine to DNA, estimated from an analysis of their fluorescence enhancements, indicate the formation of stable complexes. Photoexcited berberine and palmatine caused DNA cleavage, specifically at almost all guanine residues, under the aerobic condition after Escherichia coli formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase or piperidine treatment, suggesting the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo), an oxidized product of 2'-deoxyguanosine, and further oxidized products. The formation of 8-oxodGuo was confirmed by HPLC measurement. The quantum yield of 8-oxodGuo formation by berberine was almost the same as that induced by palmatine. Berberine and palmatine did not cause DNA photodamage under anaerobic conditions. Scavengers of singlet oxygen (1O2), such as sodium azide and methional, inhibited DNA damage. These findings suggest that photoexcited berberine and palmatine give rise to 8-oxodGuo through 1O2 generation. The photosensitized 1O2 generation from these alkaloids was examined using near-infrared luminescence measurements. Emission at ca. 1270 nm was observed during photoexcitation of the DNA-alkaloid complexes. This emission was quenched by sodium azide, a scavenger of 1O2. In the absence of DNA, berberine and palmatine could not show the emission. This spectroscopic study has shown that photoexcited alkaloids can generate 1O2 only when the DNA-alkaloid complexes are formed. In conclusion, berberine and palmatine easily bind to DNA and induce guanine specific photooxidation via 1O2 formation. The present study suggests that berberine and palmatine can act as functional photosensitizers enabling a switch in phototoxicity via 1O2 formation by the interaction with DNA.",
