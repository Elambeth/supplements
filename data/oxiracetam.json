      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Oxiracetam (ORC) has been demonstrated to improve neurological function resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI). OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the precise molecular mechanism of ORC in the treatment of TBI. METHODS: TBI rat model was established and treated with ORC. Modified Garcia score, rotarod test and HE staining were employed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of ORC. Subsequently, RNA-seq was conducted on the hippocampus of sham, TBI and ORC rats to identify differential expression (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs. Functional analysis of DE lncRNAs and mRNAs was performed. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the expression of DE lncRNAs and DE mRNAs. Western blot was performed to explore important pathway in ceRNA networks. RESULTS: ORC has been demonstrated to effectively improve neurological function in TBI rats. A total of 10 ORC-treated DE lncRNAs and 61 DE mRNAs were obtained. A co-expression network comprising 79 lncRNA-mRNA pairs associated with the treatment of ORC was constructed. Furthermore, an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulated ceRNA network was constructed, comprising 15 mRNAs, 41 miRNAs and 10 lncRNAs. Functional enrichment, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis showed that ORC improve neurological function of TBI rats by regulating multiple signaling pathways, including the JAK-STAT/PI3K-Akt pathway, as well as affecting the expression of key genes Prlr, Cdkn1a, and Cldn1. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals the mechanism of ORC therapy in TBI rats, which mainly relies on the regulation of the JAK-STAT/PI3K-Akt pathway and the influence on the expression of key genes Prlr, Cdkn1a, and Cldn1."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often suffer memory and cognitive impairments, and oxiracetam-like drugs are considered to have a positive impact on these symptoms potentially. However, the efficacy and safety of l-oxiracetam and oxiracetam in TBI patients have not been sufficiently investigated. METHODS: The study adopts a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 clinical trial design in 74 centers across 51 hospitals in China. A total of 590 TBI patients meeting criteria will be randomly allocated into three groups in a 2:2:1 ratio: l-oxiracetam group, oxiracetam group, and placebo group. The treatment period is 14 days, with a follow-up period of 90 days. The primary outcome measure is the change in the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment score at 90 days after treatment. Secondary outcomes include changes in other cognitive assessments, neurological function, activities of daily living, and safety assessments. DISCUSSION: There is no robust evidence to suggest that l-oxiracetam and oxiracetam can enhance memory and cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate TBI. This study has the potential to answer this crucial clinical question. TRIAL REGISTRATION: chinadrugtrials.org.cn, identifier CTR20192539; ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04205565."

      "abstract": "A chiral UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated to determine oxiracetam enantiomers in human plasma, urine, and feces. The R-Oxiracetam and S-Oxiracetam were quantified using a CHIRALPAK ®AD3 column at 25 ℃, and the resolution was greater than 3.2. The S-Oxiracetam is the eutomer that isresponsible for the treatment of various brain damage. Isocratic elution was conducted at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min for 6 min using the mixture of methanol and acetonitrile (methanol:acetonitrile, 15:85) containing 0.3‰ formic acid. The methods showed linearity at the range of 0.5-100 µg/mL for each oxiracetam enantiomer. A comprehensive validation process was carried out, covering aspects including linearity, selectivity, carryover, accuracy, precision, interferences, matrix effect, recovery, dilution integrity and stability in matrix and solution. The validated methods were successfully applied to quantifying R-Oxiracetam and S-Oxiracetam in human plasma, urine, and feces of 12 healthy subjects treated with either a single dose of 2 g S-Oxiracetam injection or 4 g Oxiracetam injection in a phase-I clinical trial. There was no significant difference for plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of S-Oxiracetam between the two regimens (P＞0.05). The S-Oxiracetam and Oxiracetam were primarily eliminated through urine in their original form, with cumulative excretion rates of 92.16% and 85.92%, respectively, within 24 h after administration. Enantiomers interconversion was not observed in the plasma, urine, or feces. The results of this study suggest that replacing 4 g Oxiracetam injection with 2 g S-Oxiracetam injection could offer clinical benefits by lowering the dosage and mitigating potential risks, based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the effects of oxiracetam on cognitive impairment in the early phase of traumatic brain injury (TBI), for which no specific treatment is currently available. METHODS: The in vitro study used a cell injury controller to damage SH-SY5Y cells and evaluate the effect of oxiracetam at a dosage of 100 nM. The in vivo study used a stereotaxic impactor to induce a TBI model in C57BL/6 J mice and analyzed immunohistochemical changes and cognitive function after an intraperitoneal injection of oxiracetam (30 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. The number of mice used in this study was 60. They were divided into three groups (sham, TBI, and TBI with oxiracetam treatment) (20 mice in each group). RESULTS: The in vitro study showed that oxiracetam treatment resulted in increased superoxide dismutase (SOD)1 and SOD2 mRNA expression. The mRNA and protein expression of COX-2, NLRP3, caspase-1, and interleukin (IL)-1 β were decreased after oxiracetam treatment, along with decreases in intracellular reactive oxygen species production and apoptotic effects. TBI mice treated with oxiracetam exhibited the loss of fewer cortical damaged lesions, less brain edema, and fewer Fluoro-Jade B (FJB)-positive and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells compared to those without oxiracetam treatment. The mRNA and protein expression of COX-2, NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1β were decreased significantly after oxiracetam treatment. These inflammation-related markers, which colocalized with Iba-1-positive or GFAP-positive cells after TBI, were also decreased after oxiracetam treatment. TBI mice treated with oxiracetam had a smaller decrease in preference and more latency time than those not treated with oxiracetam, suggesting the amelioration of impaired cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Oxiracetam may be helpful in restoring cognitive impairment by ameliorating neuroinflammation in the early phase of TBI.",

METHODS: This was a prospective study which included eighty patients with post-AIS cognitive impairment (PAISCI) treated in Dongguan City People's Hospital from January 2020 to January 2022. They were randomized into study group and control group. The control group was provided with conventional therapy consisting of NBP for intravenous transfusion and oral OXR, while the study group received combination therapy of HBOT, NBP, and OXR. A comparison was drawn between the two groups regarding clinical outcomes, levels of recovery of cognitive and neurological function and intelligence, changes in inflammatory markers, and incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS: The response rate of the study group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p=0.04). The cognitive function scores of the study group were significantly better than those of the control group at the end of treatment (p<0.05). The post-treatment levels of inflammatory markers were significantly reduced in the study group when compared with the control group (p<0.05). At two weeks after treatment, the ADR rate of study group was significantly lower than the control group (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of HBOT, NBP, and OXR demonstrates robust efficacy in patients with PAISCI. It is deemed to be a safe and effective treatment regimen."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxiracetam may have a modest effect on preventing cognitive decline. Exercise can also enhance cognitive function. This trial aims to investigate the effect of oxiracetam on post-stroke cognitive impairment and explore whether this effect is modified by exercise. Furthermore, the mechanisms that mediate this effect will be investigated through a neural network analysis. METHODS: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IV trial. Patients who complained of cognitive decline 3 months after stroke and had a high risk of cognitive decline were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 800 mg of oxiracetam or placebo twice daily for 36 weeks. After randomization, a predetermined exercise protocol was provided to each participant, and the degree of physical activity was assessed using wrist actigraphy at 4, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. Resting-state functional MRI was obtained in baseline and 36-week follow-up. Co-primary endpoints are changes in the Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes. Secondary endpoints include changes in the NINDS-CSN VCIHS-Neuropsychology Protocol, Euro QoL, patient's global assessment, and functional network connectivity. If there is a significant difference in physical activity between the two groups, the interaction effect between physical activity and the treatment group will be examined. A total of 500 patients were enrolled from February 2018, and the last patient's final follow-up was completed in September 2022. CONCLUSION: This trial is meaningful not only to prove the efficacy of oxiracetam, but also evaluate whether exercise can modify the effects of medication and how cognitive function can be restored.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham-operation group (n=12), model group (n=12) and treatment group (n=12). Only the external carotid artery was exposed in sham-operation group, while the models of CI were established using suture method in the other two groups. After modeling, the rats in sham-operation group and model group were intraperitoneally injected with normal saline, and those in treatment group were administered with edaravone and oxiracetam solutions via intraperitoneal injection. Then, the specimens were obtained at 2 weeks after intervention. The cognitive function of the rats was evaluated using a water maze, Nissl staining was applied to observe the neuronal morphology, and the relative protein expressions of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and NF-κB were measured by means of Western blotting. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to determine the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expressions of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6, the content of IL-1β and IL-6 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was conducted to examine the cell apoptosis. RESULTS: Model group displayed a significantly longer escape latency and significantly fewer times of crossing the original platform than sham-operation group (p<0.05), whereas treatment group had a significantly shorter escape latency but significantly more times of crossing the original platform than model group (p<0.05). The relative protein expression level of SIRT1 was lowered significantly, while that of NF-κB was elevated significantly in model group in comparison with those in sham-operation group (p<0.05), and the opposite results were observed between model group and treatment group (p<0.05). Besides, the content of IL-1β and IL-6 in brain tissues was increased significantly in model group compared with that in sham-operation group (p<0.05), but it was decreased significantly in treatment group in comparison with that in model group (p<0.05). The relative mRNA expression levels of IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly higher in model group than those in sham-operation group (p<0.05). Moreover, model group exhibited more positive apoptotic cells and a significantly higher apoptosis rate than sham-operation group (p<0.05) and treatment group (p<0.05). No apparent abnormalities of neuronal morphology and structure were detected in sham-operation group, with many Nissl bodies. The neurons were damaged, with abnormal morphology and structure, and there were a small number of Nissl bodies in model group. The neurons were damaged in treatment group, but their morphology and structure were improved evidently compared with those in model group. CONCLUSIONS: Edaravone combined with oxiracetam can inhibit the neuronal apoptosis in CI rats by regulating the SIRT1/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect.",

      "abstract": "Military personnel are the most susceptible to concussive head injury (CHI) caused by explosion, blast or missile or blunt head trauma. Mild to moderate CHI could induce lifetime functional and cognitive disturbances causing significant decrease in quality of life. Severe CHI leads to instant death and lifetime paralysis. Thus, further exploration of novel therapeutic agents or new features of known pharmacological agents are needed to enhance quality of life of CHI victims. Previous reports from our laboratory showed that mild CHI induced by weight drop technique causing an impact of 0.224N results in profound progressive functional deficit, memory impairment and brain pathology from 5h after trauma that continued over several weeks of injury. In this investigation we report that TiO2 nanowired delivery of oxiracetam (50mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 5 days after CHI resulted in significant improvement of functional deficit on the 8th day. This was observed using Rota Rod treadmill, memory improvement assessed by the time spent in finding hidden platform under water. The motor function improvement is seen in oxiracetam treated CHI group by placing forepaw on an inclined mesh walking and foot print analysis for stride length and distance between hind feet. TiO2-nanowired oxiracetam also induced marked improvements in the cerebral blood flow, reduction in the BBB breakdown and edema formation as well as neuroprotection of neuronal, glial and myelin damages caused by CHI at light and electron microscopy on the 7th day after 5 days TiO2 oxiracetam treatment. Adverse biochemical events such as upregulation of CSF nitrite and nitrate, IL-6, TNF-a and p-Tau are also reduced significantly in oxiracetam treated CHI group. On the other hand post treatment of 100mg/kg dose of normal oxiracetam in identical conditions after CHI is needed to show slight but significant neuroprotection together with mild recovery of memory function and functional deficits on the 8th day. These observations are the first to point out that nanowired delivery of oxiracetam has superior neuroprotective ability in CHI. These results indicate a promising clinical future of TiO2 oxiracetam in treating CHI patients for better quality of life and neurorehabilitation, not reported earlier.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As a chiral drug, oxiracetam (ORT) can exist in two different isomeric forms: S-oxiracetam (S-ORT) and R-oxiracetam (R-ORT). S-ORT has emerged as a promising nootropic drug with the potential to treat brain injury and the resulting loss of neural function, memory and mental impairment as assessed by studies in various animal models. However, limited data are available on the pharmacokinetics of S-ORT in humans, so the present study was designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of S-ORT in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In part 1, subjects were intravenously administered single ascending dose (2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 g) S-ORT. In part 2, subjects were treated at a single intravenous infusion dose of 3.0 g S-ORT or 6.0 g racemic ORT using a two-sequence, two-period crossover design. In part 3, subjects were intravenously injected with 4.0 g S-ORT once a day for 7 days. Blood and urine samples were collected to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters and urine excretion rate. The safety profile of the drug was also evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: Fifty-two subjects (30 in part 1, 12 in part 2, 10 in part 3) completed the study; only one subject displayed a mild adverse event, which possibly was treatment related, and no serious adverse event occurred. In part 1 for a single dose of 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 g, the maximum concentration (Cmax) values were 111.28 ± 18.99, 230.76 ± 29.16 and 352.67 ± 42.94 μg/ml, respectively; the values of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the time of last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t) were 267.09 ± 59.66, 524.50  ± 72.87 and 822.68 ± 95.21 μg·h/ml, respectively; the AUC from 0 h to infinity (AUC0-∞) values were 274.72 ± 61.65, 536.06 ± 78.13 and 832.07 ± 96.91 μg·h/ml, respectively. The urine excretion rate of the unchanged drug was approximately 60%. After consecutive administration of S-ORT for 7 days, the accumulation index was 1.05 ± 0.08. The plasma drug concentration-time curves for both S-ORT and R-oxiracetam (R-ORT) were almost identical. CONCLUSIONS: S-ORT was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events occurred in 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 g in single- and 4.0 g in multiple-dose studies. S-ORT showed dose linearity with increasing doses and no drug accumulation after 7 days of continuous administration was observed.",

      "abstract": "In neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD), in addition to damage caused by hypoxia and ischemia, over-activation of inflammation leads to further deterioration of the condition, thus greatly shortening the optimal treatment time window. Ischemic penumbra, the edematous area encompassing the infarct core, is characterized by typical activation of microglia and overt inflammation, and prone to incorporate into the infarct core gradually after ischemia onset. If treated in time, the cells located in the penumbra can survive, thereby impeding the expansion of the infarction. We demonstrated for the first time that in the acute phase of HIBD in neonatal mice, treatment of Oxiracetam (ORC) significantly curtailed the size of ischemic penumbra together with drastic reduction of infarction. By staining various cellular markers, we found that the penumbra was defined and concentrated with activated microglia. We also analyzed transmission electron microscopy and Luminex assay results to elucidate the mechanisms involved. We further confirmed that ORC switched polarization of microglia from the inflammatory towards the alternatively activated phenotype, thus promoting microglia from being neurotoxic into neuroprotective. Meanwhile, ORC decreased proliferation of microglia; however, their functions of phagocytosis and autophagy were otherwise enhanced. Last, we clarified that ORC promoted autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway, which further induced the transition of the inflammatory to the alternatively activated phenotype in microglia. The pro-inflammatory factors secretion was inhibited as well, thereby reducing the progression of the infarction. Taken together, it is concluded that Oxiracetam reduced the expansion of ischemic infarction in part via regulating the interplay between microglia activation and autophagy, which would delay the progression of HIBD and effectively prolong the time window for the clinical treatment of HIBD.",

METHODS: Ninety-eight patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage admitted to our hospital were divided into three groups. The differences of brain edema and cerebral hemorrhage were compared between the three groups after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment, and the recovery of neurological function, serum inflammatory factors, AQP-4, MMP-9, cognitive function, activities of daily living, and adverse reactions were compared between the three groups after 2 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: There was no significant difference among the three groups before treatment (p > .05). After treatment, the recovery of neurological function, serum inflammatory factors, AQP-4, MMP-9 levels, cognitive function, and activities of daily living were improved. Among them, the neurological function recovery, serum inflammatory factors, AQP-4, MMP-9 levels, cognitive function, and activities of daily living in the combined treatment group and the control group elicited greater results than those in the routine group. The results of the combined treatment group showed the most significant difference (p < .05). The concentration of IL-6 decreased from 135.98 ± 12.54 to 91.83 ± 7.69 pg/ml, AQP-4 from 227.55 μg/L ± 21.06 to 114.31 ± 9.22 μg/L, and MMP-9 from 172.39 ± 9.81 to 94.98 ± 5.01 ng/ml. In addition, the neurological function recovery, the levels of serum inflammatory factors, cognitive function, and activities of daily living in the combined treatment group were better than those in the control group (p < .05). The mean score of MRS in the combined treatment group decreased from 3.36 ± 0.98 at admission to 1.91 ± 0.38. CONCLUSION: Oxiracetam combined with Ginkgo biloba extract in the treatment of acute cerebral hemorrhage has a significant improvement effect.",

      "abstract": "As a α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, nicergoline can induce vasodilation and increase arterial blood flow. Its clinical application can effectively prevent and treat cognitive impairment and reduce cognitive decline and comprehensively improve patients' daily living ability and social function. The clinical efficacy of nicergoline combined with oxiracetam in the treatment of vascular cognitive impairment after stroke was analyzed. 120 patients with cognitive impairment after stroke were randomly divided into nicergoline group and Experience group. They were treated with nicergoline and nicergoline combined with oxiracetam respectively. Both groups were treated for one month. Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) was used to evaluate the cognitive function of the two groups before and after treatment, and the clinical efficacy was compared. The results showed that the average score of MoCA in the combined group was (5.97±2.06), higher than that in the nicergoline group (3.53±1.44). The change of MoCA score was the most significant. There was significant difference between the nicergoline group and the combined group (t=4.21, P<0.01). The combined group had the highest effective rate and the total effective rate was 93.3%. Conclusion: Nicergoline and oxiracetam are effective drugs in the treatment of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). The combined use of nicergoline and oxiracetam is better than that of nicergoline alone. The combined use of nicergoline and oxiracetam can significantly improve the severity of symptoms and quality of life in patients with vascular cognitive impairment after stroke. The clinical effect is definite.",

The multifactorial etiology, complex pathophysiology and different combination of symptoms (unusual speech patterns, frequent repetition of phrases) make it difficult to treat. Thus, present study aimed to find the protective effects of oxiracetam alone and in combination with zinc on brain behavioral, biochemical, pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotransmitters level. Rats were administered with propionic acid (250 mg/kg p.o.) for 3 days and immediately on next day treatment were given with oxiracetam (25, 50 mg/kg i.p), zinc (4 mg/kg) as well as oxiracetam (25 mg/kg i.p) in combination with zinc (4 mg/kg p.o). Behavioral parameters were performed from 22th to 28th day. On 29th day, all the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the brain was preserved for biochemical (LPO, GSH, nitrite, mitochondrial complex I, IV and cAMP), neuroinflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and neurotransmitters (5-HT, GABA, glutamate and acetylcholine) analysis. The propionic acid administration showed memory impairment, restrictive behavior, increased proinflammatory cytokines level, biochemical and neurotransmitters alteration. However, treatment with oxiracetam alone and in combination with zinc significantly attenuated behavioral, biochemical, inflammatory cytokines and restored neurotransmitters level. The finding of present study demonstrated that oxiracetam alone and in combination with zinc afforded superior anti-autistic effect through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxic mechanisms and could serve as attractive strategy in managing autism.",

The therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of ORC in vascular dementia (VaD) treatment remain unknown. In this study, 3-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats with permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion-induced VaD were treated orally with low (100 mg/kg) or high (200 mg/kg) dose ORC once a day for 4 weeks. The results of the Morris water maze test and Nissl staining showed that ORC treatment significantly alleviated learning and memory deficits and neuronal damage in rats with VaD. Mechanistically, the protein levels of a panel of genes associated with neuronal apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bax) and autophagy (microtubule-associated protein 1 chain 3, Beclin1, p62) were significantly altered by ORC treatment compared with VaD, suggesting a protective role of ORC against VaD-induced neuronal apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, the Akt/mTOR pathway, which is known to be the upstream signaling governing apoptosis and autophagy, was found to be activated in ORC-treated rats, suggesting an involvement of Akt/mTOR activation in ORC-rendered protection in VaD rats. Taken together, this study demonstrated that ORC may alleviate learning and memory impairments and neuronal damage in VaD rats by altering the expression of apoptosis/autophagy-related genes and activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in neurons.",

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke has become one of the leading causes of deaths and disabilities all over the world. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of combined bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and oxiracetam treatments on acute cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by complete reperfusion, as well as a cortex neuron oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model was established. When compared with BMSCs or oxiracetam monotherapy, combination therapy significantly improved functional restoration with decreased infarct volume in observed ischemic brain. We propose that it may occur through the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)6 neuron survival pathway. The increased expression of TRPC6 along with the reduction of neuronal cell death in the OGD cortex neurons and combination therapy group indicated that the TRPC6 neuron survival pathway plays an important role in the combined BMSCs and oxiracetam treatments. We further tested the activity of the calpain proteolytic system, and the results suggested that oxiracetam could protect the integrity of TRPC6 neuron survival pathway by inhibiting TRPC6 degradation. The protein levels of phospho-cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB) were tested. It was found that BMSCs play a role in the activation of the TRPC6 pathway. Our study suggests that the TRPC6 neuron survival pathway plays a significant role in the protective effect of combined BMSCs and oxiracetam treatments on acute cerebral I/R injury. Combined therapy could inhibit the abnormal degradation of TRPC6 via decreasing the activity of calpain and increasing the activation of TRPC6 neuron survival pathway.",

RESULTS: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and limbs muscle force of both groups improved after treatment, and the improvement of the treatment was superior to that of the control group, suggesting a significant difference (P<0.05). The reduction of serum inflammatory factor level of the treatment group was much larger than that of the control group after treatment, and the difference had statistical significance (P<0.05). The survival analysis suggested that the survival rates of the two groups had a statistically significant difference (P<0.05).

Oxiracetam is a nootropic drug that is commonly used to treat cognitive deficits of cerebrovascular origins. However, oxiracetam is currently used as a racemic mixture whose effective ingredient has not been identified to date. In this study, we first identified that (S)-oxiracetam, but not (R)-oxiracetam, was the effective ingredient that alleviated the impairments of spatial learning and memory by ameliorating neuron damage and white matter lesions, increasing the cerebral blood flow, and inhibiting astrocyte activation in chronic cerebral hypoperfused rats. Furthermore, using MALDI-MSI and LC-MS/MS, we demonstrated that (S)-oxiracetam regulated ATP metabolism, glutamine-glutamate and anti-oxidants in the cortex region of hypoperfused rats. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that (S)-oxiracetam alone could be a nootropic drug for the treatment of cognitive impairments caused by cerebral hypoperfusion.",

      "abstract": "The blood brain barrier (BBB) maintains the basic stability of the brain tissue under physiological conditions, while destroys and exaggerates brain edema and inflammatory response after ischemic stroke. In this study, we researched S-oxiracetam (S-ORC), a nootropic drug, alleviates BBB dysfunction and protects against ischemic stroke in rats. Middle cerebral artery occlusion(MCAO)/reperfusion in rats is applied to mimic ischemic stroke. One hour after reperfusion, rats are administered intravenously with different dose (0.12, 0.24, or 0.48g/kg) of S-ORC for continuative three days. Seventy-two hours after MCAO, TTC staining, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, brain water content, immunohistochemical staining, EB extravasation, western blot are provided to evaluate the protective effect and possible mechanism of S-ORC on BBB dysfunction. Furthermore, brain concentration of verapamil (P-glycoprotein substrate) and atenolol (paracellular transport marker) were assayed by UPLC-MS/MS co administration with or without S-ORC. The results show that post-treatment of S-ORC decreases cerebral infarct size, lessens brain edema, inhibits neutrophil infiltration and cytokines releasing. Furthermore, S-ORC treatment decreases EB leakage, downregulates MMP-9, upregulates occludin and claudin-5, and decreases brain concentration of verapamil and atenolol after MCAO surgery. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that post-treatment of S-ORC alleviates BBB dysfunction by regulating tight junction proteins (TJPs), upregulating P-glycoprotein function, and protects against ischemic stroke as result.",

To date, many studies have focused on investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms of CCH; however, the treatment of the induced cognitive impairment remains ineffective. Thus, the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment after CCH and potential agents for treating this impairment need to be explored further. Oxiracetam is a nootropic drug that improves clinical outcomes for some central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Whether it can improve cognitive impairment after CCH is unknown. In this study, we used behavioural methods, electrophysiology, biochemistry, histopathological staining and transmission electron microscope to investigate rat's cognitive impairment by CCH, and found that Oxiracetam could improve CCH-induced cognitive impairment and prevent deficits of neural plasticity, white matter lesions, and synaptic ultrastructure. These results suggest that Oxiracetam may be effective as a potential agent against CCH-induced cognitive impairment.",

Forty Sprague Dawley female rats (220 ± 20 g) were subjected to a 2-hour ischemic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-24 hours reperfusion model. The rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. Rats from BMSCs group, oxiracetam group, and BMSCs + oxiracetam group accepted injection of BMSCs (3 × 10(6) cells), oxiracetam (800 mg/kg), and BMSCs + oxiracetam, respectively. Rats from control group did not receive any interventions after ischemia reperfusion. The neurologic function was examined by modified neurological severity scores (mNSS). B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression and apoptosis were detected by immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The mNSS was decreased in all treatment groups and that in BMSCs + oxiracetam group was lower than BMSCs group and oxiracetam group (P < .05). The expression of Bcl-2 was unregulated in all treatment groups (P < .05), and similarly, the expression of Bcl-2 in BMSCs + oxiracetam group was higher than BMSCs group and oxiracetam group (P < .05). Control group displayed more TUNEL-positive cells than the treatment groups, and BMSCs + oxiracetam group displayed less apoptotic cells than BMSCs group or oxiracetam group (P < .05). Transplantation of BMSCs can promote the recovery of neurologic function in MCAO rats, and the effect of BMSCs combined with oxiracetam was better than the either one. Upregulation of Bcl-2 resulting in a decrease of apoptosis may be one of the mechanisms of BMSCs treatment for cerebral ischemic stroke.",

After plasma samples were deproteinized with acetonitrile, the post-treatment samples were analyzed on a C18 column interfaced with a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer in the positive electrospray ionization mode at a flow rate of 0.35ml/min. Piracetam was used as internal standard (IS). Multiple selected reaction monitoring was performed using the transitions m/z 159.00→141.94, 159.95→113.98 and 142.98→125.97 to quantify oxiracetam, HOPAA and IS, respectively. This method was validated over the concentration range of 25-2250μg/ml for oxiracetam (r(2)≥0.99) and 0.5-250μg/ml (r(2)≥0.99) for HOPAA. Intra-run and inter-run precision values of oxiracetam and HOPAA were less than 15% and accuracy was within 85-115% at all quality control levels. The average extraction recovery was 93.9% for oxiracetam and 95.6% for HOPAA, respectively. In conclusion, a simple, sensitive and specific HPLC-MS/MS method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study in rats after an intravenous administration at a high dose of 2g/kg.",

METHODS: Thirty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham operation group, model group and treatment group. Feeney method were used to establish traumatic brain injury (TBI) model in rats in model and treatment group, and rats in sham group were only broached without hydraumatic fitted. Rats in treatment group were successive administration for 21 days with oxiracetam (100 mg/kg, ig). Neurologic impairment scores were undertook after operation of 1 d, 4 d, 7 d, 14 d and 21 d, and Morris water maze test were proceeded during 15 to 19 days after operation. Average escape latency, searching time in target quadrant and number of crossing target platform in rats were recorded. RESULTS: Neurologic impairment scores of rats in treatment group were significantly less than those of model group after operation of 7, 14 and 21 d (P < 0.05). Average escape latency of model group were significantly higher than those of sham operation group and treatment group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Searching time in target quadrant and number of crossing target platform of model group were lower than those of sham operation and treatment group (P < 0.05)). CONCLUSION: Oxiracetam could decrease neural injury and increase ability of learning, memory and space cognition in traumatic brain injury rats.",

Consequently, the effect of chronic oxiracetam (OXI) treatment in TMT impaired animals was evaluated. In all experiments, a behavioural testing was performed 3 weeks after TMT administration. Experiment 1: A single TMT oral dose, 5 and 7.5 but not 2.5mg/kg, impaired the natural ability of the adults to recognize a juvenile conspecific that they encountered 30 min before. The dose of 5mg/kg TMT was chosen to be used in subsequent experiments. Experiment 2: Chronic OXI pre-+post-treatment, daily 3 or 30 mg/kg sc for 7 days before and 7 days after the insult, protected the adults against recognition deficit produced by TMT. Experiment 3: OXI pre- but not post-treatment (always 3 and 30 mg/kg) had beneficial effects on the social recognition. The findings suggest that social recognition ability of adult male rats pre-treated sufficiently long with OXI is resistant to the neurotoxicity effect of TMT.",

They are thought to directly influence energetic processes in the brain and, therefore, they are supposed to improve memory and cognition. The content of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) and 3H-valine incorporation into proteins were measured, and the morphometry was performed after PIR and OXI treatment of astrocytes cultured in vitro with or without dibutyryl 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dBcAMP). Nootropics were added into the culture medium for 2 weeks at a final concentration of 10(-7) M. It was shown that OXI increased ATP content in astrocytes cultured with or without dBcAMP. The increase in 3H-valine incorporation into astrocytes after PIR and OXI together with dBcAMP treatment was found. These results indicate that the presented research model allows to study energetic processes in cultured astrocytes. However, nootropic drugs changed morphometric parameters (cell area, perimeter and form factor) of cultured astrocytes as well. It can be concluded that PIR and OXI as nootropics have an opposing effect on the content of high-energy phosphates and shape of astrocytes in vitro.",

The GH response to GHRH was significantly increased by both drugs in a fasting state. The postprandial response was not significantly modified by pyridostigmine nor by oxiracetam. Neither of these compounds was able to enhance the postprandial GH 'paradoxical' response to GHRH in anorectic patients. The lack of effect of both groups postprandially also suggests a suppression of somatostatinergic activity.",

The light-dark aversion test was selected and was carried out in aged mice. Habituation to the test box occurred over a 3-day period, control mice showing a significant between-day increase in the time spent in the dark box, but not in the number of transitions. On Day 4, following post-trial administration over a 3-day period of oxiracetam (50-100 and 200 mg/kg ip) or ascorbic acid (62.5-125 and 250 mg/kg ip), a significant between-day increase in the time spent in the black area, but not in the number of transitions, was found. The combination of oxiracetam (100 mg/kg ip) with ascorbic acid (125 mg/kg ip) produced a similar pattern of results. The acute administration of scopolamine (0.25 mg/kg ip) to mice treated over a 3-day period with vehicle disrupted the habituation response. In mice that had received the 3-day treatment with oxiracetam or ascorbic acid or its combination, scopolamine failed to alter significantly the learning pattern. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that ascorbic acid, alone or in combination with oxiracetam, may prevent experimentally induced amnesia in aged mice.",

C57 and DBA mice were subjected to daily injections of oxiracetam (50 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle (0.9% saline) for a total of 9 days. C57 and DBA mice were examined on a modified version of the Morris water maze task and the contextual fear conditioning task on the last 5 or 2 days, respectively, of the 9-day treatment schedule. When compared with controls, C57 and DBA oxiracetam-treated mice showed no difference in motor skill capability to perform these complex learning tasks (swim speed or ability to freeze). Hippocampal PKC activity was measured in cytosolic, loosely-bound, and membrane-bound homogenate fractions. Oxiracetam-treated DBA mice demonstrated a significant increase in spatial learning performance as determined by the Morris task. DBA performance was also improved in contextual learning as determined by the fear conditioning task. The increase in spatial learning performance was correlated to an increase in membrane-bound PKC. No substantial improvements in C57 mice were observed on either learning task nor did hippocampal PKC activity change in response to oxiracetam treatment. These data demonstrate that the learning impairment of DBA mice can be reversed by treatment with a nootropic agent and support previous studies suggesting that PKC may be one mechanism of action for oxiracetam.",

The assessment of the results obtained at two, six and twelve months was carried out following both the methodology based on neuropsychological tests and scales, and the study of the simple reaction time by any of a computerized portable tachystoscope. The patients treated with Oxiracetam showed a statistically significant improvement of simple reaction time and cognitive function detected by the Attention matrix. In the placebo group after twelve months a significant worsening of cognitive and global function was observed in comparison with baseline scores. The patients themselves appeared in favor of Oxiracetam. The drug tolerability proved to be very good for the whole duration of the treatment.

The subjects were divided into four experimental groups, according to a double-blind cross over incomplete randomized block design. After a baseline neuropsychological examination, each subject received in two separate sessions one of the following treatments, as acute oral doses: oxiracetam 800, 1600, 2400 mg or placebo. One hour after treatment scopolamine hydrobromide (0.5 mg) was given subcutaneously. The cognitive performance was tested before and 1, 2, 3 and 25 h after scopolamine administration. Scopolamine caused a deterioration of performance of verbal episodic memory, semantic memory and attention tests. In comparison to placebo, oxiracetam improved the overall test performance, with a statistically significant difference at the dose of 1600 mg on delayed recall of word lists, and showed dose-related antagonism of scopolamine-induced effects also on semantic memory and attention. The efficacy of an acute dose of oxiracetam in reducing scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment supports the potential usefulness of this pharmacological model of amnesia for studying the effects of cognition enhancers in humans.",

Efficacy was assessed by a neuropsychological battery (simple reaction time, controlled associations, short story, Raven's Progressive Matrices, token test, digit span, word list learning), administered at the beginning and at the end of the study, and by a quality of life scale, administered at entry and after 6 and 12 weeks treatment. Sixty-five patients (28 men, 37 women, mean age 71 yrs) were enrolled; 58 completed the study: 2 on oxiracetam were withdrawn because of poor tolerability, 2 (one in each group) were withdrawn for poor compliance, one (on oxiracetam) for the occurrence of a transient ischaemic attack (defined as not related to the treatment) and 2 for administrative reasons. A significantly (p < 0.01) different effect in favour of oxiracetam was observed on the quality of life scale, and confirmed by significant (defined according to the Bonferroni technique) differences in some neuropsychological tests (e.g. controlled associations, short story). Four patients in the oxiracetam group complained of a total of 5 unwanted effects, and 1 on placebo complained of 3 unwanted effects, but none of them was withdrawn from the study.",

Focal cerebral ischemia reduced LCGU in the entire ipsilateral cortex, the greatest reduction being in the lateral parts of the frontoparietal cortex. LCGU was slightly reduced in the contralateral cortex; this reduction was considered to be caused by diaschisis. Oxiracetam was administered intraperitoneally for 3 days prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion. In the ipsilateral cortex, LCGU reduction was minimized in the ischemic center areas by oxiracetam at a dose of 400 mg/kg and in more extensive areas, by a dose of 800 mg/kg. Moreover, oxiracetam at a dose of 800 mg/kg enhanced metabolism impaired by diaschisis in the caudal areas of the contralateral cortex. These findings suggest that oxiracetam minimizes the reduction of brain function induced by ischemia and may therefore be useful in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease.",

Sixty male and female outpatients participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial, comparing the effects of oxiracetam 800 mg b.i.d. and placebo during 90 days of treatment. At the end of therapy, statistical analysis evidenced significant improvements in the group receiving oxiracetam in respect to the placebo group on Mini Mental State Examination, Auditory Continuous Performance Test, Rey's 15 Words Test, Block Tapping Test, Mattis Word Fluency, Luria Alternating Series and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Afterwards, 29 of the 30 patients who received oxiracetam, participated in the open follow-up study, receiving 800 mg b.i.d. oxiracetam for a total standard period of 1 year. Statistical improvements in comparison to baseline were again found on the same tests of the first 90 days (except for Rey's 15 Words Test) and on the Memory item of the Inventory of Psychic and Somatic Complaints Elderly. During the late phase of the follow-up, statistically significant worsenings in comparison to baseline were observed on Digit Span Backward, Gibson's Spiral and some non-memory items of IPSC-E. Neither severe adverse events were observed during the whole study, nor changes in routine laboratory examinations. In conclusion, in the present population of patients with mild to moderate degree dementia, the safety of 1,600 mg/day of oxiracetam also up to 1 year of treatment was confirmed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) develop severe hypertension and cerebrovascular lesions on drinking 1% NaCl from weaning. These animals present a learning and memory impairment as well as impairment of both energy metabolism and membrane phospholipid turnover. We tested both choline uptake into the cells and incorporation into choline phosphoglyceride (CPG) by incubating slices from hippocampus and cortex. After 5 min of incubation, a noticeable decrease in free labelled choline content inside the cells as well as its incorporation into phospho-choline (PC) and CPG were found in the brain of SHR, as compared to Wistar-Kyoto (WK) rats. This may indicate that in the SHRs with cerebrovascular lesions there is a reduction in choline uptake which in turn causes a decline in CPG biosynthesis through de novo pathway. Oxiracetam treatment is able to restore the labeled choline content in the cells from SH rats, as well as the incorporation of choline into its derivatives PC and CPG, to the levels found in the WK or more. Tests performed in the presence of such a high affinity choline uptake as hemicholinium (HC) confirmed the capacity of oxiracetam to stimulate choline uptake into the cells even if the results obtained up to now are not sufficient to hypothesize a direct effect of oxiracetam on acetylcholine metabolism. In conclusion, from the results obtained it would seem reasonable to hypothesize that the effects of the drug above mentioned on the cholinergic system may be secondary to its effect on choline phosphoglycerides biosynthesis.",

After injection of tranylcypromine (a MAO inhibitor), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) which had been previously infused with norepinephrine (NE) for 14 days displayed stroke-related behaviour including kangaroo-like posture, seizures and death. Administration of oxiracetam at doses of 400 and 800 mg/kg/d p.o. for 14 days before tranylcypromine injection inhibited the stroke-related behaviour. 2. Bilateral common carotid and vertebral artery occlusion induced electroencephalogram (EEG) flattening, the EEG recovering gradually after re-perfusion of cerebral blood flow. Oxiracetam administered after the re-perfusion at a dose of 100 mg/kg, i.v. accelerated the recovery. This facilitatory effect was not seen when either piracetam (50 and 100 mg/kg i.v.) or idebenone (50 and 100 mg/kg i.v.) were administered. 3. Occlusion of middle cerebral artery produced cerebral infarction and disturbed the circadian rhythm of spontaneous motor activity with an relative increase of activity in the light period. Treatment with oxiracetam (400 mg/kg/d p.o.) for 14 days after the occlusion showed a tendency to an improvement in the disturbed circadian rhythm but did not influence the size of brain infarction. From these results, oxiracetam is thought to have a protective effect in cerebrovascular impairment.",

Thereafter, the number of DHP binding sites increased up to the initial level on day 4 of the treatment. The nootropic drug oxiracetam, when injected simultaneously with Ca2+ channel blockers at a dose of 10 mg/kg, prevented this transient decrease in DHP receptor density in brain.

The lesion, too, completely prevented the rise (about 35%) in striatal ACh content induced by oxotremorine and apomorphine acting at muscarine and dopamine receptors, respectively. Acute intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg/kg of either oxiracetam or choline chloride resulted in time-dependent recovery of ACh output from the striata of decorticated rats to control levels. Oxiracetam also normalized the ex vivo striatal SDHACU activity of decorticated rats 2 h after administration without any effect in sham-operated rats. Oxiracetam or choline chloride administered before oxotremorine (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.) or apomorphine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) reinstated the ACh-increasing effect of these agonists. It is suggested that choline chloride acts directly simply by being the precursor for ACh, whereas oxiracetam may act indirectly, possibly by increasing the availability of choline chloride for ACh synthesis. Furthermore, the frontally decorticated rat could constitute a useful model for studying means to restore the deficit in striatal cholinergic neurotransmission.",

      "abstract": "It has been previously demonstrated that spontaneously hypertensive adult rats (SHR) develop severe hypertension and cerebrovascular lesions on drinking 1% NaCl from weaning and that the phospholipid metabolism in the whole brain is actively altered in these lesioned animals (SHR-NaCl) as compared to SHRs which drink only water and show only sporadic cerebrovascular lesions. We have now assayed the incorporation of labelled choline, ethanolamine, glycerol and arachidonic acid into the phospholipids from the cortex and hippocampus of SHR-water and SHR-NaCl at different time intervals from injection into the lateral ventricle of the brain. A noticeable decrease of both choline and arachidonate specific activity (SA) in the phospholipids was found in the cortex and hippocampus (where the effect is most evident) from SHR-NaCl. Based on the literature and the data obtained, we suggest that in SHR-NaCl brain areas a release of choline and fatty acid also occurs from choline glycerophospholipids as a consequence of the cerebrovascular lesions caused by NaCl treatment. Even if a relatively minor loss of the amount of the lipids studied is evident from our results as compared to their entire pool, this change may be quite important if it causes a modification of the lipidic bilayer in excitable membranes. In a parallel group of SHR-NaCl animals, treated with the nootropic drug oxiracetam, we observed that the metabolic utilization of the precursors was completely restored. These experimental data favour the hypothesis that oxiracetam is effective in stimulating the phospholipid metabolism rate at levels even higher than those of the SHR-water animals.",

Because previous studies had not specifically examined the effects of oxiracetam upon dementias of vascular origin, the present study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of oxiracetam in the treatment of symptoms of multi-infarct dementia (MID) of mild to moderate severity. 3. Incremental doses of up to 1200 mg oxiracetam daily were tested in a dose-range finding design in a group of patients with clinically and neuropsychologically confirmed MID. 4.

Efficacy was assessed by the Inventory of Psychic and Somatic Complaints in the Elderly (IPSC-E), administered at entry and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment, and by the Blessed Dementia Scale and the Newcastle Memory, Information and Concentration Scale (NMICS), administered at the beginning and at the end of the study. Three hundred and seven patients were enrolled, 18 of whom were excluded from the analysis because of violation of the protocol. Two hundred and eighty-nine patients were analyzed (145 m, 144 f, mean age 73 years) and 272 completed the study; 3 patients in each treatment group were withdrawn because of poor tolerability, 10 because of poor compliance and 1 patient because of the occurrence of a cerebral stroke. A significantly (p less than 0.01) different effect, in favor of oxiracetam, was observed in the three main efficacy criteria (i.e. IPSC-E, Blessed Dementia Scale and NMIC total scores), and confirmed by descriptive analyses carried out on some subitems of the scales used. Thirty-one patients on oxiracetam and 27 on placebo complained of a total of 35 and 32 minor unwanted effects, respectively.

Another 20 DAT/MID outpatients, aged 67-85 years, were selected from our clinical records in order to obtain a control group of patients matched for age, sex, diagnosis, baseline Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and follow-up duration. All the patients were diagnosed as having mild to moderate degrees of dementia as defined by a baseline MMSE score between 14 and 24. The patients of both groups underwent, both at baseline and after 6 months, the following neuropsychological tests: MMSE, Idiopathic Cerebral Dysfunction Scale, Babcock Test, Gibson Spiral, Toulouse-Pieron Test. Statistical analysis of experimental data demonstrated that at baseline the two groups were comparable. At the end of the study period the oxiracetam group scored significantly better on the majority of the tests evaluating memory, attention, orientation, concentration and psychomotricity than the control group, in which a worsening trend was seen on the whole. No side effects were seen during oxiracetam treatment. The present study, showing positive clinical findings after long-term oxiracetam therapy in controlled conditions, confirms that this drug can be a useful pharmacological treatment for mild to moderate degrees of dementia.",

Two groups of females were injected either with oxiracetam or saline from the beginning of pregnancy until parturition. Examination of pups from birth until the first month of age revealed no-influence of the treatment on litter size, body weights, sensory motor reflexes and motility. When placed in the open field at one month of age, mice born by mothers exposed to oxiracetam displayed more self grooming and spent less time in freezing than control mice. Prenatally treated mice were then found more interactive with their environment since the introduction of a novel object in the open field was followed by increased ambulation and higher sniffing object and rearing object scores. At three months of age, mice from both groups were tested in a radial six-arm maze task. Choice accuracy was significantly higher in prenatally treated mice which also tended to optimize their exploratory sequences by frequently running the maze in a clock-wise fashion. These results suggest that the better learning performances observed in the experimental group could be viewed as a consequence of an enhanced cognitive development based upon the higher rate of interactions with the environment shown by prenatally treated mice during ontogeny.",

A symptom questionnaire consisting of 21 items was rated pre-treatment, and improvement or worsening of any of the symptoms recorded monthly.

No statistically significant differences were observed between the treatment groups in any of the above-mentioned evaluations; neither were any differences in the neuropsychological tests performance observed.

At the end of therapy, statistical analysis (ANOVA) detected significant differences between groups: after oxiracetam treatment, improvements were observed on Mini Mental State Examination, Auditory Continuous Performance Test, Block Tapping Test, Word Fluency and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. No side effects were observed. In conclusion, in the present population of patients with mild to moderate degree dementia, 1600 mg/day of oxiracetam was effective in enhancing both attentional activities and other, more complex, neuropsychological functions.",

The aim of this study was the evaluation of the effects of oxiracetam treatment on clinical symptoms in 43 patients with organic brain syndrome (OBS). After a 2-week washout period, patients were assigned to either oxiracetam or placebo, according to a randomized, double-blind, between-patients design. Both oxiracetam and placebo were orally given bid for 8 weeks; daily dose of oxiracetam was 2 X 800 mg. In OBS patients with a mild to moderate degree of cognitive impairment, oxiracetam showed to improve cognitive functions, logical performance, and attention. Other behavioral and functional parameters were also positively modified.",

      "abstract": "The therapeutic efficacy and safety of oxiracetam (ISF 2522), a new nootropic cyclic GABA derivative, were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 40 patients with organic brain syndrome in late life. The psychopathology was characterized by memory deficits, intellectual dysfunction, lack of drive, and disturbance of affectivity. Patients were randomly assigned to a 4-week treatment with either 2 X 400 mg oxiracetam capsules t.i.d. or identical placebo capsules in the same dosing schedule. Evaluation of the psychopathology and side effects was carried out at weeks 0, 1 and 4; laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis), a battery of psychometric tests and quantitative EEG investigations were done at weeks 0 and 4. In the oxiracetam group a slight but significant improvement in global symptomatology was observed within 1 week, with further improvement after 4 weeks. In the placebo group, an improvement was seen only in the 4th week. Evaluation of the detailed psychopathology by means of the Sandoz clinical assessment geriatric scale (SCAG) showed in the oxiracetam group significant improvements in loss of appetite and vertigo after 1 week and in short-term memory, anxiety, emotional lability, fatigue, loss of appetite and vertigo after 4 weeks. In contrast, not a single item improved significantly during placebo treatment. Although the differences in SCAG scores between the two groups failed to reach statistical significance, the overall trend towards improvement was significantly better in the oxiracetam group. The tolerability of the drug was good.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
