      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effects of GO on depressive behaviors and reproductive parameters in rats exposed to CRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into three groups: sham, CRS-control, and CRS-GO. Behavioral assessments using the SPT and measurements of body and testes weights were conducted. Reproductive potential was evaluated by ELISA for testosterone, LH, and FSH levels, as well as sperm characteristics. Oxidative stress levels were assessed through MDA measurements and antioxidant enzyme activities. Additionally, apoptotic and signaling pathway proteins were analyzed by measuring cleaved caspase-3 and Nrf-2 levels in the testes using western blot analysis. RESULTS: GO mitigated depressive behaviors and reduced serum corticosterone levels compared to the CRS-control group. GO increased testosterone, LH, and FSH levels and improved sperm parameters. GO supplementation reduced MDA levels and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities compared to the CRS-control group. The analysis showed that GO down-regulated cleaved caspase-3 levels and up-regulated Nrf-2 protein levels in the testes of CRS rats compared to the CRS-control group. CONCLUSION: The administration of GO treatment can contribute to the recovery from male reproductive complications by regulating oxidative stress and apoptotic pathways."

      "abstract": "γ-Oryzanol (Orz) is a powerful antioxidant found in rice bran and oil, known for its numerous health benefits. Nevertheless, its precise impact on skin wound healing remains largely unexplored. This research focuses on comprehensively examining the ability of Orz to promote tissue repair through laboratory-based and animal model experiments. The research further examines its antimicrobial activity and its role in promoting wound healing through anti-inflammatory effects. To evaluate the effect of Orz on tissue repair, scratch assays performed in vitro were used to analyze its impact on cellular migration. An in vivo experiment utilizing a rat skin wound excision model was carried out to investigate wound contraction rates and analyze histological modifications. The granulation tissue from a dead space wound model was examined to assess the levels of inflammatory mediators, free radicals, and antioxidant activity. The findings of the study demonstrated Orz improves cellular viability while facilitating the proliferation and migration of NIH-3T3 cells. It further promotes the generation of growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 21 and transforming growth factor-β. Moreover, Orz exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against various pathogens commonly found in wounds. An ointment with 10 % Orz showed significant effectiveness in promoting wound healing, as indicated by notable wound contraction observed on the 14th day after surgery. Histological analysis demonstrated that the application of 10 % Orz ointment resulted in remarkable tissue repair, heightened fibroblast proliferation, and improved formation of new blood vessels. The application of Orz ointment was also found to elevate interleukin-10 levels, reduce tumor necrosis factor-α levels and ED-1-immunopositive cells, and enhance antioxidant enzyme activity, thereby mitigating oxidative damage in healing tissues throughout the initial stages of tissue repair. These results indicate that Orz holds significant promise for application in the treatment of surface wounds."

      "abstract": "The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is approximately doubled in subjects with hypercholesterolemia compared to those with normal blood cholesterol levels. Monacolin K (MK), the main active substance in rice fermented by the Monascus purpureus, acts on cholesterol metabolism. Rice also contains other bioactive compounds such as γ-oryzanol (OZ) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, the efficacy and tolerability of a food supplement (FS) based on an ingredient standardized to contain monacolins (4.5%), OZ, and GABA were evaluated in subjects with mild dyslipidemia. For the duration of the trial, enrolled subjects (n = 44, each group) received the FS or placebo and were instructed to use an isocaloric diet. Compared to the placebo group, after a 3 months of the FS, the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and mean TC values were reduced by 19.3 and 8.3%, respectively, while the mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol value increased by 29.3%. On average, the subjects shifted from very high to moderate CVD risk. Glucose metabolism and hepatic and renal parameters did not change after the treatment and no adverse events were reported. Guidelines to handle hypercholesterolemia with food supplements in specific clinical settings are needed to better manage mild dyslipidemia.",

Because of the unsatisfactory outcomes of current conventional treatments for this condition, its treatment must be continuously explored and optimized. AIM: To assess the clinical effectiveness of γ-oryzanol in combination with Femoston for PMS. METHODS: A total of 119 patients with PMS were selected from June 2023 to December 2023, which included 59 and 60 patients in the control and observation group, respectively. The control and observation groups were treated with Femoston and γ-oryzanol + Femoston, respectively. Comparative analyses were performed in terms of clinical effectiveness, safety (dizziness and headache, nausea and vomiting, and breast tenderness), sex hormones [estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)], lumbar spine (L1-4) and bilateral femoral bone mineral density (BMD), and sleep quality (sleeping time and frequency of awakenings from sleep). RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the observation group had statistically higher total effective rates of treatment; lower overall incidence of adverse events; higher post-treatment E2 levels and L1-4 and bilateral femoral BMD; and lower LH and FSH levels, sleeping time, and frequency of awakenings from sleep after treatment. CONCLUSION: Therefore, for the treatment of PMS, γ-oryzanol combined with Femoston is significantly better than Femoston alone in terms of clinical effectiveness, exhibiting more pronounced clinical advantages in improving safety, sex hormone levels, BMD, and sleep quality."

However, the bioactive compound is difficult to incorporate due to its low solubility and stability. A nanoemulsion allows substances to be packaged in nanometric sizes, improving their bioavailability. In this work, a GO nanoemulsion was developed using high-energy techniques. The methodological process began with the formulation of the coarse emulsion, where the emulsifiers (sodium caseinate and citrus pectin), diluent (rice bran oil), and pH were varied to find the most stable formulation. The coarse emulsion was subjected to four high-energy techniques (conventional homogenization, high-pressure homogenization, ultra-high-pressure homogenization, and ultrasonication) to reduce the droplet size. A physical-stability test, rheological-behavior test, image analysis, and particle-size-and-distribution test were conducted to determine which was the best technique. The formulation with the highest stability (pH 5.3) was composed of 87% water, 6.1% sodium caseinate, 0.6% citrus pectin, 6.1% rice bran oil, and 0.2% GO. The ultrasonic treatment obtains the smallest particle size (30.1 ± 1 nm), and the high-pressure treatment obtains the greatest stability (TSI < 0.3), both at 0 and 7 days of storage. High-energy treatments significantly reduce the droplet size of the emulsion, with important differences between each technique."

Oryzanol is an antioxidant compound that is related to the absorption of cholesterol, and is used in hyperlipidemia treatment and menopause problems. RBO extraction, purification and its γ-oryzanol content have been carefully reviewed. The quality and concentration of γ-oryzanol depend on the extraction process and purification. In selecting the extraction method to obtain the highest oryzanol content, in addition to comparing the concentration of oryzanol obtained and it can also be done by comparing the extraction kinetics parameters. Modeling according to physical or empirical kinetics can contribute in increasing the result of extraction. This study aims to determine the highest oryzanol content in rice bran oil, comparing several extraction methods and studies of rice bran oil extraction kinetic is necessary for scale up purposes. In this study is conducted Rice Bran Oil Extraction with n-Hexane solvent using several different methods, such as maceration, ultrasonication, and pneumatic press extractions. Independent variable that is used is the extraction time and yield as dependent variable. The study shows that the best extraction method to get the highest yield is 10.34 % by ultrasonicator and oryzanol content is 5.09 mg/g by a pneumatic press machine. According to kinetic parameter k2 is 0.001546, Cs is 0.0589, and h is 0.4707, R2 = 0.9715 obtained from extraction using ultrasonicator."

      "abstract": "The excessive activation of glutamate in the brain is a factor in the development of vascular dementia. γ-Oryzanol is a natural compound that has been shown to enhance brain function, but more research is needed to determine its potential as a treatment for vascular dementia. This study investigated if γ-oryzanol can delay or improve glutamate neurotoxicity in an in vitro model of differentiated HT-22 cells and explored its neuroprotective mechanisms. The differentiated HT-22 cells were treated with 0.1 mmol/L glutamate for 24 h then given γ-oryzanol at appropriate concentrations or memantine (10 µmol/L) for another 24 h. Glutamate produced reactive oxygen species and depleted glutathione in the cells, which reduced their viability. Mitochondrial dysfunction was also observed, including the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I activity, the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and the reduction of intracellular ATP levels in the HT-22 cells. Calcium influx triggered by glutamate subsequently activated type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) in the HT-22 cells. The activation of CaMKII-ASK1-JNK MAP kinase cascade, decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and increased Apaf-1-dependent caspase-9 activation were also observed due to glutamate induction, which were associated with increased DNA fragmentation. These events were attenuated when the cells were treated with γ-oryzanol (0.4 mmol/L) or the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine. The results suggest that γ-oryzanol has potent neuroprotective properties against glutamate excitotoxicity in differentiated HT-22 cells. Therefore, γ-oryzanol could be a promising candidate for the development of therapies for glutamate excitotoxicity-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including vascular dementia.",

Gamma-oryzanol (γ-Oryzanol) has several pharmacological properties such as antioxidant and anti-apoptosis that can be used in this way. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of nanoethosomal formulation of gamma-oryzanol (γ-Oryzanol-NEs) on testicular damages in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion damage. Following induction of ischemia/reperfusion, the mice were treated with γ-Oryzanol and γ-Oryzanol-NEs (6 mg/kg) in times of 3 h and 6 h. The expression of positive cells of TUNEL, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) and caspase 3 and histopathological parameters were assessed. The results showed higher expression of positive cells of TUNEL, HSP70 and caspase 3 and lower expressions of SOD and GPx in control mice compared with those treated with γ-Oryzanol-NEs (P = 0.001). The treatment with γ-Oryzanol-NEs could decrease pathological damages and the expression of positive cells of TUNEL, HSP70 and caspase 3 and increase the expressions of SOD and GPx. In conclusion, γ-Oryzanol-NEs could have the protective effects on torsion/reperfusion by decreasing apoptosis and increasing antioxidant status in a mouse model."

The use of natural compounds has become an attractive approach to prevent NAFLD and its progression. Gamma-oryzanol (Orz) is a natural compound whose beneficial effects on chronic metabolic diseases have been reported. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the preventive effect of Orz on the hepatic proteome in a diet induced NAFLD model. Wistar rats were randomly distributed into three experimental groups (n=6/group) according to the diet received for 30 weeks: Control group, high sugar-fat (HSF) group, and HSF+Orz group. The isolated Orz was added to the chow at the dose of 0.5% (w/w). We evaluated the nutritional profile, characterized the presence of steatosis through histological analysis, triglyceride content in liver tissue and hepatic inflammation. Next, we performed label-free quantitative proteomics of hepatic tissue. Network analysis was performed to describe involved protein pathways. NAFLD induction was characterized by the presence of hepatic steatosis. Orz prevented lipid accumulation. The compound prevented alterations of the hepatic proteome, highlighted by the modulation of lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, xenobiotic metabolism, and the sirtuin signaling pathway. It was possible to identify key altered pathways of NAFLD pathophysiology modulated by Orz which may provide insights into NAFLD treatment targets.",

Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents that reduce peripheral inflammation are potential targets for the prevention or treatment of these debilitating diseases. In the present study, we investigated whether gamma-oryzanol (ORY) could protect against chronic neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in adult male mice. Mice were injected with LPS (0.75 mg/kg/day) or saline for 7 consecutive days and orally received ORY (100 mg/kg) or vehicle for 14 days (7 days before LPS injections and 7 days co-treated with LPS). After two weeks, mice were subjected to behavioral assessments using the Morris water maze and Y-maze. Moreover, the expression level of several inflammatory mediators was measured in the hippocampus of treated animals. Also, neuronal loss, microglia, and astrocyte densities were evaluated in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampus. We found that ORY treatment significantly improved spatial and working memory in LPS-treated mice. This behavioral improvement was accompanied by a significant reduction in the number of microglia and astrocytes in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampus. Moreover, ORY treatment effectively prevented LPS-induced increases in the expression of inflammatory mediators and enhanced neuronal survival in the CA1 hippocampus. Our findings suggest that ORY treatment can be a therapeutic option to improve cognitive impairments and neuroinflammation induced by endotoxins.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential impact and mechanism of γ-Ory in treating OA. And the inhibition of γ-Ory in extracellular matrix molecule (ECM) degradation, ferroptosis, and Keap1-Nrf2 binding in IL-1β-exposed chondrocytes was detected via immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and co-immunoprecipitation. Micro-CT, SO staining, and immunofluorescence have been conducted to assess the impact of γ-Ory treatment on ACLT-mediated OA in rats at both imaging and histological stages. We found that γ-Ory dose-dependently suppressed IL-1β-induced ECM deterioration and chondrocyte ferroptosis. Our animal experiments revealed that γ-Ory delayed ACLT-mediated OA development. Mechanistically, γ-Ory interfered with the binding of Keap1 to Nrf2 to promote the latter's nuclear import, thereby increasing the expression of detoxification enzymes. Summarily, our works support γ-Ory's potential as a candidate drug for the treatment of OA.",

Rice bran, a by-product of rice milling, contains many bioactive compounds with potential pharmaceutical and therapeutic benefits. In recent years, research has highlighted the anti-inflammatory potential of rice bran, contributed by the bioactive components concentrated in their bran but, unfortunately, entrapped in the bran matrix, with limited bioavailability. Previous studies have reported that the enzymatic treatment of rice bran improves the bran's bioactive compound profile but did not investigate its impact on chronic conditions such as inflammation. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study investigates the anti-inflammatory effects of endo-1,4-β-xylanase (ERB) and Viscozyme (VRB) treated red rice bran extracts against lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages in comparison with non-enzyme-treated bran (CRB). Further established their efficacy with known anti-inflammatory compounds-ferulic acid (FA), catechin (CAT), γ-tocopherol (GTP), and γ-oryzanol (ORZ). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were pre-treated with non-toxic concentrations (10-200 μg/mL) of FA, CAT, GTP, ORZ, CRB, ERB, and VRB, followed by inflammatory stimulation with LPS for 24 h. Further, the cell supernatant and pellets were harvested to study the anti-inflammatory effects by evaluating and measuring their efficacy in inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β) and mediators (ROS, NO, PGE2, COX2, iNOS) through biochemical, ELISA, and mRNA expression studies. RESULTS: The findings showed that both ERB and VRB effectively inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6) and mediators (ROS, NO, PGE2) by downregulating mRNA expressions of inflammatory genes (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, COX2, iNOS) and demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy higher than CRB. On comparison, ERB demonstrated exceptional efficacy by causing a reduction of 48% in ROS, 20% in TNF-α, and 23% in PGE2 at 10 μg/mL, surpassing the anti-inflammatory capabilities of all the bioactive compounds, FA and ORZ, respectively. At the same time, VRB exhibited remarkable efficacy by reducing NO production by 52% at 200 μg/mL and IL-6 by 66% at 10 μg/mL, surpassing FA, CAT, ORZ, and GTP. Further, ERB downregulated the mRNA expression of IL-10 and iNOS, while VRB downregulated TNF-α, IL-1β, and COX2 expression. Both extracts equally downregulated IL-6 expression at 10 μg/mL, demonstrating the efficacy more remarkable/on par with established anti-inflammatory compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, enzyme-treated rice bran/extract, particularly ERB, possesses excellent anti-inflammatory properties, making them promising agents for alternatives to contemporary nutraceuticals/functional food against inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Depression is a severe mental condition, common among menopausal women. γ-Oryzanol (ORY) has various biological properties; however, the effect of ORY on menopausal depression and its underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: ORY is orally administered to ovariectomized (OVX) mice for 20 weeks. ORY administration results in lower immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim test and increases locomotor activity in the open field test. In the primary hippocampal neurons and hippocampi of OVX mice, ORY treatment increases nitric oxide (NO) production and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) expression. Further, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and tropomyosin receptor kinase B, along with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factior (BDNF), is upregulated. These stimulatory effects of ORY are diminished by treatment with estrogen receptor β (ERβ) antagonist. ORY similarly interacts with ERβ in the molecular docking analysis. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of 7-nitroindazole, a nNOS inhibitor, abolishes the antidepressant effects of ORY. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that ORY attenuates depressive behavior in OVX mice by upregulating ERβ-mediated hippocampal nNOS expression and activating the ERK-CREB-BDNF signaling networks. The findings suggest that ORY is a potential therapeutic agent for attenuating menopausal depression.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study was conducted to examine the effects of daily intake of γ-oryzanol (ORZ)-fortified canola oil, as compared with plain canola and sunflower oils, on certain inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers in adult subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). METHODS: We randomly allocated 92 adult subjects with T2D from both sexes to one of the following groups to receive: (a) ORZ-fortified canola oil (ORZO; n1 = 30); (b) unfortified canola oil (CANO; n2 = 32); or (c) sunflower oil (SUFO; n3 = 30) for 12 weeks. Dietary and laboratory evaluations were performed initially and finally. RESULTS: Serum hs-CRP concentrations significantly decreased in ORZO group (from 3.1 ± 0.2 to 1.2 ± 0.2 mg/L), as compared with CANO (p = 0.003) and SUFO (p < 0.001) groups. Serum IL-6 significantly decreased just in ORZO (- 22.8%, p = 0.042) and CANO groups (- 19.8%, p = 0.038). However, the between-group differences were not significant. Serum IL-1β slightly decreased in ORZO (- 28.1%, p = 0.11) and increased in SUFO (+ 20.6%, p = 0.079) but between-group difference was statistically significant (p = 0.017). Serum IFN-γ concentrations decreased significantly only in ORZO (from 3.3 ± 0.08 to 2.9 ± 0.21 IU/mL, p = 0.044). Salivary IgA concentrations increased significantly in all three intervention groups. Notwithstanding, only the difference between ORZO and CANO groups was statistically significant (p = 0.042). Similarly, circulating malondialdehyde concentrations significantly decreased in all three groups but with no between-group significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of ORZ-fortified canola oil, compared with unfortified canola and sunflower oils, for 12 weeks resulted in boosting of certain anti-inflammatory effects of canola oil. These findings may have preventive implications for both clinicians and policy makers. This clinical trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (03.08.2022; NCT05271045).",

      "abstract": "Antioxidants are promising therapeutics for treating oxidative stress-mediated liver diseases. Previously, we studied a potent natural antioxidant, ferulic acid, and developed a liposomal formulation of ferulic acid (ferulic-lipo) to improve its solubility. Ferulic-lipo significantly attenuated oxidative damage in the liver by inhibiting reactive oxygenase species (ROS). However, antioxidative liposomes must be less reactive with ROS prior to reaching the target sites to effectively neutralize existing ROS. But ferulic-lipo tends to be oxidized before reaching the liver. Besides, γ-oryzanol has been reported to decompose into ferulic acid in vivo; accordingly, we hypothesized that γ-oryzanol could be employed as a natural prodrug of ferulic acid to improve stability and antioxidative effectiveness. Therefore, in this study, we prepared a liposomal formulation of γ-oryzanol (γ-ory-lipo) and investigated its therapeutic effects in a CCl4-induced rat model of liver injury. We found that γ-ory-lipo has a higher chemical stability than does free γ-oryzanol. Although the antioxidative effect of γ-ory-lipo was lower than that of ferulic-lipo, pretreatment of the HepG2 cells with γ-ory-lipo improved the viability of CCl4-treated cells to a similar level as treatment with ferulic-lipo. γ-Oryzanol was shown to be converted into ferulic acid in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, intravenous administration of γ-ory-lipo exhibited a similar effectiveness as ferulic-lipo against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity, which should be the due to the conversion of γ-oryzanol into ferulic acid. These findings demonstrated that γ-ory-lipo could be a good natural prodrug of ferulic acid for eradicating its stability problem.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is caused by disease or trauma and results in a partial or complete loss of motor or sensory function below the injury level. Most patients with SCI are young, and long-term disability imposes both psychological and financial burdens. Rice is the most abundant source of γ-oryzanol, which exhibits both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. γ-Oryzanol has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in an intact form and have beneficial effects on brain function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the effect of γ-oryzanol on motor function recovery in mice after SCI. METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into three groups: the sham group, the injury group, and the γ-oryzanol-treated group that received an intraperitoneal γ-oryzanol (100 mg/kg) injection every 2 days for 42 days after SCI. The effect of γ-oryzanol was assessed through various approaches. Behavioral tests were performed using Basso mouse scale scores and gait analysis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, Luxol fast blue staining, magnetic resonance imaging ,and immunofluorescence staining were used to observe the lesion area changes, demyelination, axonal regeneration, and scar tissue formation. The levels of inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood of mice were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Behavioral tests showed that γ-oryzanol treatment improved gait following SCI. Pathological examination revealed that demyelination at the site of injury improved with γ-oryzanol treatment and was accompanied by the retention of axons associated with motor function and reduced scarring. Additionally, γ-oryzanol treatment decreased the serum levels of pro-inflammatory factors. CONCLUSIONS: Studies have shown that γ-oryzanol promotes motor function recovery in mice after SCI. Therefore, γ-oryzanol might be the latent target for SCI therapy."

Adult male rats were divided into seven groups (n = 8 each) as control, control + NAC, control + γ-Oryzanol, HFD, HFD + NAC, HFD + γ-Oryzanol, and HFD + NAC + γ-Oryzanol. NAC was administered orally at a final concentration of 200 mg/kg, whereas γ-Oryzanol was added to diets at a concentration of 0.16. All treatments were conducted for 17 weeks and daily. Both NAC and γ-Oryzanol were able to reduce final body weights, fat weights, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, serum, and serum levels of liver function enzymes as well as the inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukine-6 (IL-6), and leptin in HFD-fed rats. They also improved hepatic structure and glucose tolerance, increased adiponectin levels, and reduced serum and hepatic levels of triglycerides (TGs) and cholesterol (CHOL) in these rats. These effects were concomitant with a reduction in the hepatic levels of lipid peroxides (MDA) and serum levels of LDL-C, but also with an increment in the hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). Interestingly, only treatment with γ-Oryzanol stimulated the mRNA levels of proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) in the liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) of rats. Of note, the combination therapy of both drugs resulted in maximum effects and restored almost normal liver structure and basal levels of all the above-mentioned metabolic parameters. In conclusion, a combination therapy of γ-Oryzanol and NAC is an effective therapy to treat NAFLD, which can act via several mechanisms on the liver and adipose tissue.",

Each ejaculate of an individual bull was divided into four equal aliquots. Gamma-oryzanol was supplemented at 0 (control), 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mM in tris-citrate egg yolk extender. The parameters of sperm motility were evaluated using computer assisted semen analyzer (CASA). The results showed that the progressive motility was significantly higher in 0.5 mM of gamma-oryzanol supplementation group when compared with the control group (p < 0.05), but no significant differences were observed among the treatments. In addition, a proteomic approach was applied to analyze the differentially expressed proteins in post-thawed sperm with or without gamma-oryzanol supplementation in extender. We confirmed that 2-phospho-d-glycerate hydro-lyase (ENO1), glutathione s-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1), phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), outer dense fiber protein 2 (ODF2), tektin-4 (TEKT4), tubulin beta-4B chain (TUBB4B), and ATP synthase subunit beta (ATP5B) were up-regulated in 0.5 mM of gamma-oryzanol supplementation group, which might be associated with the improved post-thawed motility observed in this treatment group.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a highly prevalent musculoskeletal disorder characterized by a local inflammatory response associated with the IL-1β/NLRP3 inflammasome positive feedback loop. Rice bran-derived gamma-oryzanol (Ory) as a sterol ferulate has attracted much attention due to its powerful anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic health effects. As a clinical pharmaceutical for autonomic disorders, Ory's role in musculoskeletal degenerative disease remains unknown. PURPOSE: This study aims to validate the role of Ory in IVDD and explore the potential mechanism. STUDY DESIGN: Establishing the in vitro and in vivo IVDD models to detect the protective effect and molecular mechanism of Ory. METHOD: The anti-ECM degradation, antioxidant and anti-NLRP3 inflammasome activation effects of Ory on IL-1β-stimulated nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, etc. MRI, S-O staining and immunohistochemistry were performed to estimate the effects of Ory administration on acupuncture-mediated IVDD in rats at imaging and histological levels. RESULTS: Ory treatment inhibited IL-1β-mediated ECM degradation, oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in NP cells. By interfering with NF-κB signaling and ROS overproduction, Ory interrupted IL-1β/NLRP3-inflammasome positive cycle. In vivo experiments showed that Ory delayed acupuncture-mediated IVDD development. CONCLUSION: Our results support the potential application of Ory as a therapeutic compound for IVDD.",

RBO is rich in bioactive ingredients with potential health benefits, such as gamma-oryzanol (GO) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Despite its benefits, the quality of RBO depends on the degree of stabilisation of the RB, which is easily affected by lipase enzymes, and thus needs an effective treatment prior to RBO production. To assess the potential of the microwave-assisted method for RB stabilisation and RBO extraction, three Carolino rice varieties (Ariete, Teti, Luna) were tested. The effect of RB stabilisation was evaluated via acid value, water absorption, and GO and GABA levels. The RBO yield was optimised by solvent, temperature, and solvent-to-sample ratio, and the GO and fatty acid levels were determined. The RB stabilisation for the Luna variety did not affect the GO and GABA; for the Ariete and Teti varieties, the GO decreased by 34.4% and 24.2%, and the GABA increased by 26.5% and 47.0%, respectively. The GO levels in RBO samples were not affected by RB stabilisation. The RBO nutritional value was confirmed by the suitable ratio (>2) between polyunsaturated (PUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA), with the Teti variety presenting the highest ratio."

Natural products and plants are used as important sources for production of new drugs. The current study assesses the effects of gamma-oryzanol (GO) in a rat model with surgically induced endometriosis. The experimental endometriosis was induced in 24 wistar rats, and the animals were subsequently subdivided into endometriosis-sole (endom group), 3000 and 6000 µg/kg GO (GO-3000 and GO-6000) and Vit C groups.

TUNEL staining was used for detecting the apoptosis rate. The results revealed that protein levels of SF1, HO1, and total LC3B significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in GO-6000-treated groups compared to endom group. Moreover, the protein level of BECN1 and SIRT-1 significantly (P < 0.05) increased in GO-6000-treated groups compared to endom group. GO treatment did not imply any significant difference (P > 0.05) concerning the protein levels of ER-α. The TUNEL staining results showed higher TUNEL-positive cells reactions in the rats treated with GO-6000 and Vit C. Thus, GO is involved in improving condition rats involved with endometriosis through modulation in the protein levels of some molecules and also induction of apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "Plants are natural laboratories producing a cornucopia of secondary metabolites of huge therapeutic potential. The oil extracted from rice bran, a by-product of brown rice processing, is abundant in valuable bioactive substances. One of its main ingredients is gamma-oryzanol that is a mixture of phytosterol esters and ferulic acid. These compounds exert a wide range of biological activities closely correlated with their chemical properties. Their hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant abilities are crucial for improving the physiology and condition of the human body. For these reasons, there has been a clear increase in the number of studies investigating the use of gamma-oryzanol in the treatment of many chronic diseases, and it is even tested as a promising non-pharmacological therapeutic agent in the treatment of COVID-19 in overweight people. This paper describes the chemical structure and activity of gamma-oryzanol based on biological activity of phytosterol esters and ferulic acid. It also discusses the effects of gamma-oryzanol on some physiological processes in the human and animal organisms.",

ORY is an important biologically active ingredient isolated from rice bran oil, which has anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. However, it is still unknown whether ORY can protect the liver from the HIR damage. In this study, ORY was administered orally for seven days, after which the animals were subjected to liver ischemia for 60 minutes and reperfused for 6 hours. Related indicators were analyzed. The results showed that ORY pretreatment significantly reduced the levels of AST and ALT, relieved hepatocellular damage and apoptosis, and attenuated the exhaustion of SOD and GSH and accumulation of MDA and MPO. Interestingly, ORY treatment could significantly decreased ER stress. Furthermore, ORY pretreatment remarkably reduced the protein expressions of HMGB1, NLRP3, caspase-1 (p20), and IL-1β to protect the liver from I/R-induced inflammasome activation and apoptosis. In conclusion, we demonstrated the potential effect of ORY in modulating oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammasome activation during HIR.",

However, it has been suggested that obesity-related inflammation could be involved in insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) development due several mechanisms, among them, the reduced expression of the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4). Gamma-oryzanol (γOz) is a compound present in the whole grain of rice that presents anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The aim of this study was to verify if the effect antioxidant and anti-inflammatory of yOz attenuate insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of obese rats by increasing GLUT- 4 expression. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (±187 g) were initially randomly distributed into 2 experimental groups (control, n = 6, and high sugar-fat diet (HSF), n = 12) for 20 weeks. At week 20th of this study, once obesity and insulin resistance were detected in the HSF group, animals were divided to begin the treatment with γOz or continue receiving HSF for 10 more weeks. At the end it was analyzed nutritional, metabolic, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters and GLUT-4 protein expression. RESULTS: The treatment improved insulin resistance, reduced inflammation, increased antioxidant response and GLUT-4 expression. CONCLUSION: It is possible to conclude that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of yOz attenuates insulin resistance by increasing GLUT-4 expression in skeletal muscle of obese animals.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is a multiligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface receptors expressed in many organs, among them, the kidneys. When activated, RAGE leads to a sequence of signaling that results in inflammation and oxidative stress, both involved in kidney disease pathogenesis. Gamma-oryzanol (γOz) comprises a mixture of ferulic acid (FA) esters and phytosterols (sterols and triterpene alcohols) mainly found in rice, with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. AIM: To evaluate the effect of γOz to reduce renal inflammation and oxidative stress by modulating AGEs/RAGE axis in animals submitted to a high sugar-fat diet. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (±187g) were randomly divided into two experimental groups: control (n = 7 animals) and high sugar-fat diet (HSF, n = 14 animals) for 20 weeks. After this period, when the presence of renal disease risk factors was detected in the HSF group (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, increased systolic blood pressure and obesity), the HSF animals were divided to begin the treatment with γOz or continue receiving only HSF for 10 more weeks. RESULTS: No effect of γOz on obesity and metabolic parameters was observed. However, kidney inflammation and oxidative stress decreased as soon as RAGE levels were reduced in HSF + γOz. CONCLUSION: It is possible to conclude that the gamma- oryzanol was effective in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidney by modulating the AGEs/RAGE axis.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The literature has reported a higher prevalence of negative clinical outcomes due to Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in obese individuals. This can be explained by the cytokine storm, result from the cytokine production from both obesity and viral infection. Gamma-oryzanol (γOz) is a compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, little is known about the γOz action as a possible agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that γOz attenuates the cytokine storm by stimulating PPAR-γ in the adipose tissue. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups and fed ad libitum for 30 weeks with control diet (C, n = 6), high sugar-fat diet (HSF, n = 6) or high sugar-fat diet + γOz (HSF + γOz, n = 6). HSF groups also received water + sucrose (25%). The γOz dose was 0.5% in the chow. Evaluation in animals included caloric intake, body weight, adiposity index, plasma triglycerides, and HOMA-IR. In adipose tissue was evaluated: PPAR-γ gene and protein expression, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters, and histological analysis. RESULTS: Adipose tissue dysfunction was observed in HSF group, which presented remarkable PPAR-γ underexpression and increased levels of cytokines, other inflammatory markers and oxidative stress. The γOz treatment prevented adipose tissue dysfunction and promoted PPAR-γ overexpression. CONCLUSION: Natural compounds as γOz can be considered a coadjutant therapy to prevent the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with obesity conditions.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of colon cancer recurrence and metastasis is known to increase as an adverse effect related to postoperative infection. Lipopolysaccharide or LPS, which is derived from gram-negative bacteria, is a key inducer of inflammatory-related tumor metastasis. Although there are numerous known biological effects of purple rice extract (PRE), its protective effect on colon metastasis was unknown. This study first evaluated the effects of hexane soluble fraction (HSF) or γ-oryzanol-rich fraction of PRE on LPS-induced colon cancer adhesion and invasion, which was accomplished using adhesive and invasive assay. Gelatin zymography was also utilized for gelatinase activity and secretion. Its chelating activity was also further analyzed by reverse gelatin zymography with zinc chloride. The study findings support the synergistic effect of HSF in protection against adverse events from LPS-induced colon cancer metastasis, as shown by effects on adhesive and invasive ability as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion and activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Bacterial infection is still one of the main adverse events following abdominal cancer surgery and is associated with an increased incidence of colon cancer metastasis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of this pathogen-mediated response. This first study investigated the efficiency of a gamma-oryzanol (OR) rich fraction, collected from purple rice extract (PRE), against LPS-induced colon cancer metastasis that occurs via three main steps; adhesion to the extracellular matrix, the secretion, and activity of gelatinase and further tissue invasion. The acquired data supported the role of an OR-rich fraction from PRE as a potential inhibitor to LPS-induced colon cancer progression. This finding, related to PRE, could be further developed to create a new adjunctive treatment to reduce operative complications related to bowel cancer surgery as well as increasing the value of this crop in Thailand.",

The mice were divided into five groups and treated with I) PCL-sole (PCL), III) PCL-mupirocin (PCL-M), IV) PCL-GO, IV) PCL-CS, and V) PCL-CS-GO. Wound area, total bacterial count, histopathological parameters, and expressions of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10, MMP-9, EGF, and VEGF were assessed. The fibers were randomly distributed in PCL group, but loading CS and GO increased the complexity and placing on the dressings. PCLs loaded with GO and CS showed lower viscosity, surface tension, and fiber diameter and higher conductivity and water contact angle compared to unloaded PCLs (P < 0.05). The treatment with PCLs loaded with mupirocin, CS, and GO significantly reduced wound area and total bacterial count (P < 0.05). Loading PCLs with mupirocin, CS, and GO decreased the expressions of IL-1β, TNF-α, MMP-9, but increased the expressions of IL-10 and VEGF compared to the unloaded PCL group (P < 0.05).

The present study was designed to investigate the anxiolytic effect of 0.5% γ-oryzanol (GORZ) and its neurochemical and molecular mechanisms under chronic 10% ethanol consumption. Five-week-old ICR male mice received either control (14% casein, AIN 93 M) or GORZ (14% casein, AIN 93 M + 0.5% GORZ) diets in this study. We showed that GORZ could potentially attenuate alcohol-induced anxiety-like behaviors by significantly improving the main behavioral parameters measured by the elevated plus maze test. Moreover, GORZ treatment significantly restored the alcohol-induced downregulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid in the hippocampus and improved homovanillic acid levels in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, a recovery increase in the level of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol both in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex supported the anxiolytic effect of GORZ. The significant elevation and reduction in the hippocampus of relative mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and interleukin 1β, respectively, also showed the neuroprotective role of GORZ in ethanol-induced anxiety. Altogether, these results suggest that 0.5% GORZ is a promising neuroprotective drug candidate with potential anxiolytic, neurogenic, and anti-neuroinflammatory properties for treating adolescent alcohol exposure.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A high-fat diet (HFD) can induce obesity and metabolic disorders that are closely associated with cognitive impairments, and the progression of several psychiatric disorders such as anxiety. We have previously demonstrated the anxiolytic-like effect of Gamma oryzanol (GORZ) in chronic restraint stressed mice. OBJECTIVE: We studied the neurochemical and molecular mechanisms that underlie the preventive effect of GORZ in HFD-induced anxiety-like behaviors, monoaminergic dysfunction, and inflammation. METHODS: Eight-week-old Institute of Cancer (ICR) male mice weighing 33-34 g were divided into the following groups and free-fed for 8 weeks: control (14% casein, AIN 93M); HFD; HFD + GORZ (0.5% GORZ). Body weight gain was checked weekly. The anxiolytic-like effects of GORZ were examined via open-field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Brain levels of monoamines [5-hydroxy tryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE)] and their metabolites [5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG)], proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-αα (Tnf-α) mRNA levels, and interleukin 1-β (Il-1β) mRNA levels in the cerebral cortex and amygdala were examined using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD), and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. RESULTS: Mice fed a HFD for eight weeks showed anxiety-like behaviors in association with HFD-induced body weight gain. GORZ potentially blocked HFD-induced anxiety-like behaviors via significant improvement of the primary behavioral parameters in behavioral tests, with a minor reduction in HFD-induced body weight gain. Furthermore, GORZ treatment significantly downregulated HFD-induced upregulation of dopamine levels in the brain's amygdala. Significant reduction of the relative mRNA expression of Tnf-α and Il-1 β was also observed in the amygdala of HFD + GORZ mice, compared to HFD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly suggest that 0.5% GORZ exerts anxiolytic-like effects, possibly through downregulation of dopamine, and via expression of proinflammatory cytokines Tnf-α and Il-1 β in the case of chronic HFD exposure."

The anti-MetS, antioxidative stress and anti-inflammation properties of PE were more potent than γ-oryzanol. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Our study showed that PE or γ-oryzanol supplement could help control metabolic disorders, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and related complications.",

Thus, an anti-oxidative stress remedy might be a promising means for the treatment of ALS. The aim of the present study is to investigate the neuroprotective effects of γ-oryzanol (Orz) and elucidate its relevant molecular mechanisms in mutant hSOD1-linked Drosophila and cell models of ALS. Orz treatment provided neuroprotection in flies with expression of hSOD1-G85R in motor neurons, as demonstrated by the prolonged survival, improvement of motor deficits, reduced oxidative damage and regulated redox homeostasis when compared with those in controls. Moreover, Orz significantly decreased neuronal apoptosis and upregulated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) antioxidant pathway via activating Akt in hSOD1-G93A-expressing NSC-34 cells. In addition, our results showed that both in vivo and in vitro, Akt served as an upstream regulator of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 3 stimulated by Orz, which further increased the level of another anti-oxidative stress factor heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70). Altogether, these findings provide evidence that Orz has potential neuroprotective effects that may be beneficial in the treatment of ALS disease with SOD1 mutations.",

Rice is rich in phytochemicals and antioxidants with several biological activities; among these compounds, the presence of γ-oryzanol is noteworthy. The present study aims to explore the effects of γ-oryzanol on cognitive performance in a mouse model of neuroinflammation and cognitive alterations. METHODS: Mice received 100 mg/kg γ-oryzanol (ORY) or vehicle once daily for 21 consecutive days and were then exposed to an inflammatory stimulus elicited by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A novel object recognition test and mRNA expression of antioxidant and neuroinflammatory markers in the hippocampus were evaluated. RESULTS: ORY treatment was able to improve cognitive performance during the neuroinflammatory response. Furthermore, phase II antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH-dehydrogenase-quinone-1 (NQO1) were upregulated in the hippocampi of ORY and ORY+LPS mice. Lastly, γ-oryzanol showed a strong anti-inflammatory action by downregulating inflammatory genes after LPS treatment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that chronic consumption of γ-oryzanol can revert the LPS-induced cognitive and memory impairments by promoting hippocampal antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecular responses.",

In this study, self-emulsified alginate beads (SEABs) were prepared with different weight ratios of self-emulsion treatment (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30%) with alginate. We found that the microstructure with a surfactant of SEABs had a different appearance with alginate-based beads. The encapsulation of γ-oryzanol corresponded with the self-emulsion/alginate ratio, which was 98.93~60.20% with a different formulation of SEABs. During in vitro release, SEABs had the gastric protection of γ-oryzanol/algae oil, because γ-oryzanol and emulsion were not released in the simulated stomach fluid. When the SEABs were transferred to a simulation of the small intestine, they quickly began to swell and dissolve, releasing a higher content of the emulsion. We observed that the emulsion that formed had a bimodal distribution in the simulated intestinal fluid as a result of the hydrogel and emulsion droplets, leading to the formation of large aggregates. These results suggested that γ-oryzanol encapsulation within alginate beads via emulsification combined with gelation can serve as an effective controlled delivery system.",

Experiments were conducted on five different levels of nitrogen fertilization. Among the different treatments, grains of 2 N (two-fold of the recommended amount of nitrogen fertilizer) treatment showed the highest total Toc, total T3, α-T3, β-Toc, γ-Toc and γ-T3 levels, whereas 0 N (no treatment) group had the highest GO content. Increasing nitrogen fertilization significantly reduced the rice grain catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, but not the superoxide dismutase activities. Under 0 N and 0.5 N (low N fertilization) treatments, malondialdehyde and H2O2 contents in rice grains were significantly higher than that of other treatments. These results suggest that a two-fold increase in nitrogen fertilization favor the accumulation of Toc and T3 but not GO in rice grains."

      "abstract": "The present study assessed the effects of daily supplementation with 33 mg/metabolic weight (MW) of γ-oryzanol on testicular degeneration induced by scrotal insulation in rams. Eight animals were divided into two groups: Control (subjected to scrotal insulation without treatment) and Gamma (subjected to scrotal insulation and γ-oryzanol treatment). The rams were subjected to scrotal insulation by covering the scrotum with a thermal bag for 72 h. Animals in the Gamma group received 33 mg/MW oral γ-oryzanol once-daily, beginning 7 days before insulation and continuing during insulation and for 20 days afterward, for a total treatment period of 30 days. Samples of semen and blood were collected during the experiment to perform biochemical evaluations of oxidative stress, seminal kinetics and morphology, and plasma testosterone concentrations. Ultrasound examinations of the testicular parenchyma and clinical evaluations of its consistency and the scrotal perimeter were also performed at weekly intervals. Testicular tissue was collected for biochemical analyses of oxidative stress parameters at the end of the experiment by orchiectomy. The results showed that testicular degeneration was induced by scrotal insulation, as was demonstrated by the reduced scrotal perimeter and increased in testicular flaccidity immediately after insulation. Moreover, a delayed increase in the number of hyperechoic points in the parenchyma and a delayed reduction in sperm motility were observed at 10 weeks after insulation by ultrasonography. Treatment with γ-oryzanol reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the testes, and increased the total antioxidant potential (assessed based on the ferric reducing ability (FRAP)) in week 10 and levels of lipid peroxidation (TBARS). It also increased the number of intact spermatozoa in week 3, but increased the total number of sperm defects from week 5 onwards. Although γ-oryzanol protected the semen and testes by reducing the levels of the parameters of oxidative stress evaluated herein, the other parameters studied were not improved by the treatment. In addition, supplementation with γ-oryzanol led to more morphological abnormalities in the sperm. This study presented new information on the oral administration of γ-oryzanol to rams with testicular degeneration, and described potential therapies for this pathology, which currently has no established treatment and has important impacts on reproductive health.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experiment, 5-week-old male ICR mice were used and the concentration of GORZ was fixed at 0.5% in the mouse standard diet (14% casein, AIN 93 M). Mice were immobilized daily for 3 h from ZT 2.5 to 5.5 (ZT0 was designated as light-on time) for 20 consecutive days, followed by behavioral testing, including the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM) test. The concentration of serum corticosterone (CORT) was measured. In addition, the expression of central monoamine neurotransmitters with their metabolites in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala of the brain were examined. KEY FINDINGS: 0.5% GORZ partially blocked stress-induced reduction of body weight gain while stressed mice had significantly lower body weights during the entire experimental period. Further, 0.5% GORZ treatment could significantly improve the main behavioral parameters even in CRST situations. The significant increase in serum CORT levels indicated CRST-induced stress, which was almost unaffected by 0.5% GORZ treatment. Moreover, 0.5% GORZ also supported the anxiolytic mechanism with enhancement of 5-HIAA and NE levels in the amygdala of brain after CRST. SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our studies suggested that 0.5% GORZ is a potential therapeutic drug candidate against anxiety under chronic stress conditions.",

This study examined the effects of RBO containing different amounts of gamma-oryzanol on blood lipid, antioxidant, and inflammatory markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 59 hyperlipidemic subjects completed the study. They were divided into four groups: RBO1 (4,000 ppm gamma-oryzanol, n = 14), RBO2 (8,000 ppm gamma-oryzanol, n = 15), RBO3 (11,000 ppm gamma-oryzanol, n = 15), and control (soybean oil, n = 15). The assigned oil (30 mL) was incorporated into three cooked meals each day for 4 weeks. Anthropometrical measurements and blood samples were taken to evaluate body weight, body composition, lipid parameters, antioxidant status, and inflammatory markers before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Compared with the control, consumption of RBO significantly decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (percentage change: -0.8% [control]; -8% [RBO1]; -11.8% [RBO2]; and -12.2% [RBO3], p = 0.012) with the greatest change found in RBO2 and RBO3. In addition, antioxidant status also improved significantly. Levels of oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) increased after consumption of a diet with RBO compared with consumption of a diet with soybean oil (ORAC: -2.7% [control]; 4.1% [RBO1]; 8.6% [RBO2]; and 10.1% [RBO3], p < 0.001; FRAP: -4.4% [control]; 4.7% [RBO1]; 7.4% [RBO2]; and 7.6% [RBO3], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RBO with gamma-oryzanol could decrease LDL-C levels and increase antioxidant capacity in hyperlipidemic subjects. Therefore, RBO consumption may reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Our previous works demonstrated that brown rice-specific bioactive substance, γ-oryzanol acts as a chaperone, attenuates exaggerated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in brain hypothalamus and pancreatic islets, thereby ameliorating metabolic derangement in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese diabetic mice. However, extremely low absorption efficiency from intestine of γ-oryzanol is a tough obstacle for the clinical application. Therefore, in this study, to overcome extremely low bioavailability of γ-oryzanol with super-high lipophilicity, we encapsulated γ-oryzanol in polymer poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (Nano-Orz), and evaluated its metabolically beneficial impact in genetically obese-diabetic ob/ob mice, the best-known severest diabetic model in mice. To our surprise, Nano-Orz markedly ameliorated fuel metabolism with an unexpected magnitude (∼1000-fold lower dose) compared with regular γ-oryzanol. Furthermore, such a conspicuous impact was achievable by its administration once every 2 weeks. Besides the excellent impact on dysfunction of hypothalamus and pancreatic islets, Nano-Orz markedly decreased ER stress and inflammation in liver and adipose tissue. Collectively, nanotechnology-based developments of functional foods oriented toward γ-oryzanol shed light on the novel approach for the treatment of a variety of metabolic diseases in humans.",

In addition to its antioxidant activity, Orz is often associated with cholesterol-lowering, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-diabetic effects. In recent years, the usefulness of Orz has been studied for the treatment of metabolic diseases, as it acts to ameliorate insulin activity, cholesterol metabolism, and associated chronic inflammation. Previous studies have shown the direct action of Orz when downregulating the expression of genes that encode proteins related to adiposity (CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs)), inflammatory responses (nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)), and metabolic syndrome (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)). It is likely that this wide range of beneficial activities results from a complex network of interactions and signals triggered, and/or inhibited by its antioxidant properties. This review focuses on the significance of Orz in metabolic disorders, which feature remarkable oxidative imbalance, such as impaired glucose metabolism, obesity, and inflammation.",

Petroleum ether, hexane and methanol were used to prepare extracts. Extraction yield were evaluated for giving high crude oil yield, total phenolic content (TPC) and γ-oryzanol content. Gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry was used for the determination of γ-oryzanol concentration. The highest concentration of γ-oryzanol was detected in methanolic extracts of microwave treatment (85.0 ppm) followed by ultrasonication (82.0 ppm) and conventional extraction method (73.5 ppm). Concentration of γ-oryzanol present in the extracts was found to be directly proportional to the total phenolic content. A combination of 80 % methanolic concentration and 55 minutes digestion time of microwave treatment yielded the best extraction method for TPC and thus γ-oryzanol (105 ppm)."

      "abstract": "Parvin-β is an adaptor protein that binds to integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and is significantly downregulated in breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines. We treated the breast cancer cell line MCF7 with 24-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate (24-MCF), a γ-oryzanol compound. We observed upregulation of parvin-β (GenBank Accession No. AF237769) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ2 (GenBank Accession No. NM_015869). Among γ-oryzanol compounds, only treatment with 24-MCF led to the formation of reverse transcription-PCR products of parvin-β (650 and 500 bp) and PPAR-γ2 (580 bp) in MCF7 cells, but not in T47D, SK-BR-3, or MDA-MB-231 cells. 24-MCF treatment increased the mRNA and protein levels of parvin-β in MCF7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. We hypothesized that there is a correlation between parvin-β expression and induction of PPAR-γ2. This hypothesis was investigated by using a promoter-reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 24-MCF treatment induced binding of PPAR-γ2 to a peroxisome proliferator response element-like cis-element (ACTAGGACAAAGGACA) in the parvin-β promoter in MCF7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. 24-MCF treatment significantly decreased anchorage-independent growth and inhibited cell movement in comparison to control treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide. 24-MCF treatment reduced the levels of GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42. Evaluation of Akt1 inhibition by 24-MCF revealed that the half maximal effective concentration was 33.3 μM. Docking evaluations revealed that 24-MCF binds to the ATP-binding site of Akt1(PDB ID: 3OCB) and the compound binding energy is -8.870 kcal/mol. Taken together, our results indicate that 24-MCF treatment increases parvin-β expression, which may inhibit ILK downstream signaling.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: γ-Oryzanol, derived from unrefined rice, attenuated the preference for dietary fat in mice, by decreasing hypothalamic endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, no peripheral mechanisms, whereby γ-oryzanol could ameliorate glucose dyshomeostasis were explored. Dopamine D2 receptor signalling locally attenuates insulin secretion in pancreatic islets, presumably via decreased levels of intracellular cAMP. We therefore hypothesized that γ-oryzanol would improve high-fat diet (HFD)-induced dysfunction of islets through the suppression of local D2 receptor signalling. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Glucose metabolism and regulation of molecules involved in D2 receptor signalling in pancreatic islets were investigated in male C57BL/6J mice, fed HFD and treated with γ-oryzanol . In isolated murine islets and the beta cell line, MIN6 , the effects of γ-oryzanol on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was analysed using siRNA for D2 receptors and a variety of compounds which alter D2 receptor signalling. KEY RESULTS: In islets, γ-oryzanol enhanced GSIS via the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway. Expression of molecules involved in D2 receptor signalling was increased in islets from HFD-fed mice, which were reciprocally decreased by γ-oryzanol. Experiments with siRNA for D2 receptors and D2 receptor ligands in vitro suggest that γ-oryzanol suppressed D2 receptor signalling and augmented GSIS. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: γ-Oryzanol exhibited unique anti-diabetic properties. The unexpected effects of γ-oryzanol on D2 receptor signalling in islets may provide a novel; natural food-based, approach to anti-diabetic therapy."

      "abstract": "Recent studies show that brown rice improves glucose intolerance and potentially the risk of diabetes, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. One of the phytochemicals found in high concentration in brown rice is γ-oryzanol (Orz), a group of ferulic acid esters of phytosterols and triterpene alcohols. Here, we found that Orz stimulated differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and increased the protein expression of adipogenic marker genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) and CCAAT/enhanced binding protein alpha (C/EBPα). Moreover, Orz significantly increased the glucose uptake in insulin-resistant cells and translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) from the cytosol to the cell surface. To investigate the mechanism by which Orz stimulated cell differentiation, we examined its effects on cellular signaling of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a central mediator of cellular growth and proliferation. The Orz treatment increased mTORC1 kinase activity based on phosphorylation of 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). The effect of Orz on adipocyte differentiation was dependent on mTORC1 activity because rapamycin blocks cell differentiation in Orz-treated cells. Collectively, our results indicate that Orz stimulates adipocyte differentiation, enhances glucose uptake, and may be associated with cellular signaling mediated by PPAR-γ and mTORC1.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The high morbidity of metabolic dysfunction diseases has heightened interest in seeking natural and safe compounds to maintain optimal health. γ-Oryzanol (OZ), the ferulic acid (FA) ester with phytosterols, mainly present in rice bran has been shown to improve markers of metabolic syndrome. This study investigates the effects of FA and OZ on alleviating high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced metabolic syndrome parameters. METHODS: Male SD rats were fed with a regular rodent diet, HFFD, or HFFD supplemented with 0.05% FA or 0.16% OZ (equimolar concentrations) for 13 weeks. Food intake, organ indices, serum lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (IR) index and cytokine levels were analyzed. The mechanisms were further investigated in oleic acid-stimulated HepG2 cells by analyzing triglyceride (TG) content and lipogenesis-related gene expressions. RESULTS: In the in vivo study, FA and OZ exhibited similar effects in alleviating HFFD-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and IR. However, only OZ treatment significantly decreased liver index and hepatic TG content, lowered serum levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6, and increased serum concentration of adiponectin. In the in vitro assay, only OZ administration significantly inhibited intracellular TG accumulation and down-regulated expression of stearoyl coenzyme-A desaturase-1, which might facilitate OZ to enhance its hepatoprotective effect. CONCLUSION: OZ is more effective than FA in inhibiting hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation. Thus, FA and OZ could be used as dietary supplements to alleviate the deleterious effects of HFFD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a leading cause of death among men due to the limited number of treatment strategies available for advanced disease. γ-oryzanol is a component of rice bran, rich in phytosterols, known for its antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic and endocrinological effects. It is known that γ-oryzanol may affect prostate cancer cells through the down regulation of the antioxidant genes and that phytosterols have anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects. There are evidences showing that some of the components of γ-oryzanol can modulate genes involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer, as caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and prostate specific androgen-regulated gene (PCGEM1). METHODS: To determine the effects of γ-oryzanol on prostate cancer cell survival we evaluated the cell viability and biomass by MTT and sulforhodamine B assays, respectively. Cell death, cell cycle and pERK1/2 activity were assessed by flow cytometry. The changes in gene expression involved in the survival and progression of prostate cancer cav-1 and PCGEM1 genes were evaluated by quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cav-1 protein by immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopy analysis. RESULTS: We found that γ-oryzanol decreases cell viability and culture biomass by apoptosis and/or necrosis death in androgen unresponsive (PC3 and DU145) and responsive (LNCaP) cell lines, and signals through pERK1/2 in LNCaP and DU145 cells. γ-oryzanol also appears to block cell cycle progression at the G2/M in PC3 and LNCaP cells and at G0/G1 in DU145 cells. These effects were accompanied by a down regulation in the expression of the cav-1 in both androgen unresponsive cell lines and PCGEM1 gene in DU145 and LNCaP cells. CONCLUSION: In summary, we used biochemical and genetics approaches to demonstrate that γ-oryzanol show a promising adjuvant role in the treatment of prostate cancer.",

Our recent study in mice showed that γ-oryzanol, a unique component of brown rice, acts as a chemical chaperone in the hypothalamus and improves feeding behavior and diet-induced dysmetabolism. However, the entire mechanism whereby γ-oryzanol improves glucose metabolism throughout the body still remains unclear. In this context, we tested whether γ-oryzanol reduces ER stress and improves function and survival of pancreatic β-cells using murine β-cell line MIN6. In MIN6 cells with augmented ER stress by tunicamycin, γ-oryzanol decreased exaggerated expression of ER stress-related genes and phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2α, resulting in restoration of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and prevention of apoptosis. In islets from high-fat diet-fed diabetic mice, oral administration of γ-oryzanol improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion on following reduction of exaggerated ER stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, we examined the impact of γ-oryzanol on low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, where exaggerated ER stress and resultant apoptosis in β-cells were observed. Also in this model, γ-oryzanol attenuated mRNA level of genes involved in ER stress and apoptotic signaling in islets, leading to amelioration of glucose dysmetabolism. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that γ-oryzanol directly ameliorates ER stress-induced β-cell dysfunction and subsequent apoptosis, highlighting usefulness of γ-oryzanol for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.",

METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effects of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), gamma-oryzanol (ORZ), acylated steryl glucosides (ASG), and phenolic extracts from germinated brown rice (GBR) on the expression of genes related to bone metabolism, such as bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX-2), osteoblast-specific transcription factor osterix (Osx), periostin, osteoblast specific factor (Postn), collagen 1&2 (Col1&2), calcitonin receptor gene (CGRP); body weight measurement and also serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and osteocalcin, in serum and bone. Rats were treated with GBR, ORZ, GABA, and ASG at (100 and 200 mg/kg); estrogen (0.2 mg/kg), or remifemin (10 and 20 mg/kg), compared to ovariectomized non-treated group as well as non-ovariectomized non-treated (sham) group. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the IL-6 and osteocalcin levels at week 2, 4, and 8, while the gene expression in the bone tissue was determined using the Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA). RESULTS: The results indicate that groups treated with GABA (100 and 200 mg/kg) showed significant upregulation of SPARC, calcitonin receptor, and BMP-2 genes (P < 0.05), while the ORZ-treated group (100 and 200 mg/kg) revealed significant (P < 0.05) upregulation of Osx, Postn, RUNX-2, and Col1&2. Similarly, IL-6 concentration decreased, while osteocalcin levels increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the treated groups as compared to ovariectomized non-treated groups. CONCLUSION: GABA and ORZ from GBR stimulates osteoblastogenesis by upregulation of bone formation genes, possibly via the activation of GABAB receptors and by inhibiting the activity of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, it could be used effectively in the management of osteoporosis.",

      "abstract": "The prevalences of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are dramatically increasing, and there is a strong need for more effective and safer therapies. However, some of drugs show limited efficacy and considerable adverse effects. Furthermore, artificial energy-dense foods and non-caloric foods may promote overeating and weight gain. In this context, a natural food-based approach may represent a valuable means of tackling the obesity-diabetes syndrome. Although recent studies have shown that brown rice improves glucose intolerance and prevents obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We found that one of the major components of brown rice, γ-oryzanol (Orz), plays an important role in the metabolically beneficial effects of brown rice. Orz acts as a chemical chaperone and decreases high fat diet (HFD)-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the hypothalamus, thereby leading to a significant shift in preference from fatty to healthy foods. Orz also decreases HFD-induced ER stress in pancreatic β-cells and improves β-cell function. Notably, Orz directly acts on pancreatic islets and enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). This evidence highlights food preference as a promising therapeutic target in obesity-diabetes syndrome and suggests that brown rice and Orz may have potential for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rice is the staple food and one of the world’s three major grain crops. Rice contains more than 100 bioactive substances including phytic acid, isovitexin, γ-oryzanol, phytosterols, octacosanol, squalene, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), tocopherol, tocotrienol derivatives, etc. Out of them, γ-oryzanol is known to have important biological profile such as anti-oxidants, inhibitor of cholesterol oxidation, reduce serum cholesterol levels in animals, effective in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, inhibit tumor growth, reduce blood pressure and promotes food storage stability when used as a food additive, etc. Hence in the present investigation, we aimed to evaluate the content and composition of γ-oryzanol from pigmented rice germplasms using a liquid chromatography with diode array detection and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI/MS). FINDINGS: In the present study, 33 exotic pigmented rice accessions (red, white and purple) have been evaluated. Among them, the contents of γ-oryzanol varied from 3.5 to 21.0 mg/100 g with a mean of 11.2 mg/100 g. A total of ten components of γ-oryzanol including Δ⁷-stigmastenyl ferulate were identified of which, cycloartenyl ferulate, 24-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate, campesteryl ferulate and sitosteryl ferulate were identified as the major components. The mean proportions of steryl ferulates were in the descending order of 24-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate > cycloartenyl ferulate > campesteryl ferulate > sitosteryl ferulate > Δ⁷-campestenyl ferulate > campestanyl ferulate > sitostanyl ferulate > Δ⁷-stigmastenyl ferulate > stigamsteryl ferulate > Δ⁷-sitostenyl ferulate. Almost 11 accessions (33%) showed higher content than the control rice Chucheongbyeo and higher proportions ranged from 10 to 15 mg/100 g. Interestingly, the red rice accession Liberian Coll. B11/B-11 (21.0 mg/100 g) showed higher content γ-oryzanol than control rice Jeokjinjubyeo (19.1 mg/100 g) and the purple rice accession Padi Adong Dumarat, Mardi No.4376 (20.3 mg/100 g) showed a similar content with control rice Heugjinjubyeo (21.4 mg/100 g). CONCLUSIONS: Most of analyzed rice accessions were found to possess higher contents of γ-oryzanol than the control rice, Chucheongbyeo. In particular, the red accessions showed highest content than the white and purpleaccessions. The content and composition of γ-oryzanol in 33 exotic pigmented rice accessions have been evaluated and compared significantly by the present investigation.",

The present study evaluated the testicular damage caused by acute cadmium exposure and verified the protective role of γ-oryzanol (ORY). Mice were administrated with a single dose of 2.5mg/kg of CdCl2, and then treated with ORY (50mM in canola oil, 5mL/kg). Testes were removed after 24h and tested for lipid peroxidation (TBARS), protein carbonylation, DNA breakage, ascorbic acid, cadmium and non-proteic thiols contents, and for the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and δ-aminolevulic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA-D). Cadmium presented a significant alteration in all parameters, except GPx and CAT activities. Therapy reduced in a slight degree cadmium concentration in testes (around 23%). ORY restored SOD and GST activities as well as TBARS production to the control levels. Furthermore, ORY partially recovered δ-ALA-D activity inhibited by cadmium. This study provides the first evidence on the therapeutic properties of ORY in protecting against cadmium-induced testicular toxicity.",

In this study, we examined whether γ-ORZ represents a suppressive effect on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced adhesion molecule expression on vascular endothelium. Treatment with LPS elevated the mRNA expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-selectin in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). Pretreatment with γ-ORZ dose-dependently decreased the LPS-mediated expression of these genes. Western blotting also revealed that pretreatment with γ-ORZ dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced VCAM-1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Consistently, pretreatment with γ-ORZ dose-dependently reduced LPS-induced U937 monocyte adhesion to BAECs. In immunofluorescence, LPS caused nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation in 40% of BAECs, which indicates NF-κB activation. Pretreatment with γ-ORZ, as well as its components (cycloartenyl ferulate, ferulic acid, or cycloartenol), dose-dependently inhibited LPS-mediated NF-κB activation. Collectively, our results suggested that γ-ORZ reduced LPS-mediated adhesion molecule expression through NF-κB inhibition in vascular endothelium.",

METHODS: The regulatory effect of gamma-oryzanol rich fraction (ORF) extracted and fractionated from rice bran using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) in comparison with commercially available OR on 14 antioxidant and oxidative stress related genes was determined in rat liver. Rats were subjected to a swimming exercise program for 10 weeks to induce stress and were further treated with either ORF at 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg or OR at 100 mg/kg in emulsion forms for the last 5 weeks of the swimming program being carried out. The GenomeLab Genetic Analysis System (GeXPS) was used to study the multiplex gene expression of the selected genes. RESULTS: Upon comparison of RNA expression levels between the stressed and untreated group (PC) and the unstressed and untreated group (NC), seven genes were found to be down-regulated, while seven genes were up-regulated in PC group compared to NC group. Further treatment of stressed rats with ORF at different doses and OR resulted in up-regulation of 10 genes and down regulation of four genes compared to the PC group. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma-oryzanol rich fraction showed potential antioxidant activity greater than OR in the regulation of antioxidants and oxidative stress gene markers."

When CAF and gamma-oryzanol were injected intradermally with anti-DNP IgE into the dorsal skin of rats, the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction induced by DNP-HSA was attenuated. CAF and gamma-oryzanol also inhibited the degranulation of DNP-IgE sensitized RBL-2H3 mast cells stimulated with anti-DNP-HSA. IgE conjugated with CAF could not be detected by anti-IgE antibody in the ELISA analysis. Although incubation of IgE with CAF did not decrease the amount of IgE, it was possible to precipitate IgE by centrifugation. These results demonstrate that CAF captures IgE, prevents it from binding to FcepsilonRI, and attenuates mast cell degranulation.",

      "abstract": "The modifying effects of phytic acid and gamma-oryzanol on the promotion stage of carcinogenesis were investigated using several two stage carcinogenesis models in rats. In a multi-organ carcinogenesis model, male F344 rats were given combined treatment with 2,2'-dihydroxy-di-n-propylnitrosamine (DHPN), N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethylnitrosamine (EHEN) and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) during the initial 3 weeks as initiators, and then treated with dietary 2% phytic acid (50% in water), 1% gamma-oryzanol or basal diet alone for 32 weeks. Although the appearance of hepatic tumors was suppressed, the incidence of urinary bladder papillomas was increased by phytic acid. In addition, the incidence and multiplicity of lung tumors were significantly increased by gamma-oryzanol. Esophagus, colon, pancreas, kidney and thyroid lesion development was not influenced by these compounds. In a gamma-oryzanol dose response experiment using DHPN in the drinking water as an initiator, enhancing effects on lung were observed at a dose of 1% but not at 0.5% or lower. When the modifying effects of phytic acid, and its sodium (Na-PA), potassium (K-PA) and magnesium (Mg-PA) salt were further examined in rats pretreated with the bladder carcinogen N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN), a clear increase in the incidences of bladder tumors was noted, with only Na-PA, phytic acid itself being without effect. Finally, examination of the modifying potential of phytic acid and gamma-oxyzanol on mammary carcinogenesis in female Sprague Dawley rats pretreated with a single intragastric dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) revealed no significant differences in the final incidences and multiplicities of mammary tumors, but the average tumor diameter was significantly reduced and the average survival time was increased with phytic acid. gamma-Oryzanol tended to decrease the size of the tumor but without significant difference. These results indicate that phytic acid inhibits hepatic and mammary carcinogenesis, while its Na-salt is a promoter of bladder carcinogenesis. The effect of phytic acid itself on urinary bladder carcinogenesis is equivocal. gamma-Oryzanol is a promoter of lung carcinogenesis but its effect is weak and exerted only at a very high dose level.",

Each patient was given 100 mg of gamma-oryzanol three times daily for 16 weeks. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, respectively, decreased significantly, from 204 and 124 mg/dl at baseline to 176 and 101 mg/dl at week 12. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 36.1 mg/dl at baseline and 35.9 mg/dl at week 12. Apolipoprotein (apo) B levels decreased significantly from 116 mg/dl to 101 mg/dl at week 16; apo A-II levels increased significantly from 31.7 mg/dl to 34.7 mg/dl; and the apo B/apo A-I ratio declined significantly from 0.99 to 0.84.

      "abstract": "Hypolipidemic effects of the usual gamma-oryzanol (gamma-OZ) and a new gamma-OZ (N-gamma-OZ) with a different sterol composition from gamma-OZ were investigated on the hyperlipidemia induced by ingestion of a high cholesterol diet (HCD) containing 1% cholesterol for 12 days in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Treatment with gamma-OZ for 6 days significantly inhibited the increase in serum total cholesterol (TC) and phospholipids (PL) induced by HCD, while the treatment with gamma-OZ for 12 days did not inhibit the increase of TC and PL. Treatment with N-gamma-OZ at 100 or 1000 mg/kg for 6 days slightly inhibited the increase of TC by HCD. The decrease of TC in high density lipoprotein (HDL-TC) was markedly inhibited by treatment with N-gamma-OZ for 12 days, but N-gamma-OZ for 6 days and gamma-OZ for 6 and 12 days did not inhibit the decrease of HDL-TC. Treatment with N-gamma-OZ for 12 days significantly inhibited the increase of PL and free cholesterol (FC) by HCD. gamma-OZ at 1000 mg/kg for 12 days also inhibited the increase of FC. N-gamma-OZ significantly reduced the atherogenic index using TC and HDL-TC by affecting the HDL-TC increase. gamma-OZ at 100 mg/kg and N-gamma-OZ at 100 mg/kg for 6 days reduced the atherogenic index using TC and HDL-TC by the inhibition of TC increase. The atherogenic index using PL and HDL-PL was only reduced by the treatment with N-gamma-OZ at 1000 mg/g for 12 days. The increase of triglyceride (TG) by HCD was inhibited by the treatment of N-gamma-OZ for 6 days (all doses) and 12 days (500, 1000 mg/kg), and gamma-OZ at 500 mg/kg for 6 and 12 days also inhibited the increase of TG by HCD. gamma-OZ and N-gamma-OZ had no effects on liver lipid contents. The hypolipidemic effect of N-gamma-OZ was slightly more potent than that of gamma-OZ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A single subcutaneous injection of 20 mg/kg of gamma-OZ suppressed GH synthesis and PRL release 1 hour after the injection. gamma-OZ increased medial basal hypothalamic (MBH) dopamine (DA) content, and the DA content was decreased by a treatment of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha MpT), a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, indicating increased synthesis and release of DA in MBH by gamma-OZ. gamma-OZ did not alter norepinephrine (NE) content in MBH, while the NE content was significantly decreased, indicating unchanged synthesis and increased release of NE in MBH by gamma-OZ. These results may explain the previous data concerning the changes in serum levels of GH and PRL by gamma-OZ and also suggest that gamma-OZ can affect the synthesis and/or release of at least two hypothalamic neurotransmitters, DA and NE, resulting in the alterations of anterior pituitary hormone synthesis and/or release.",

Similarly, chronic treatment with gamma-oryzanol resulted in decreased serum TSH levels in 6 of 8 patients. There was no change in the serum levels of thyroxine-iodine and triiodothyronine during the study. In addition, there was no difference in the serum TSH response to TRH in hypothyroid patients and normal subjects. These observations suggest that gamma-oryzanol inhibits serum TSH levels in patients with primary hypothyroidism, possibly by a direct action at the hypothalamus rather than the pituitary.",

Circadian rhythms were observed in stress ulceration with a peak at 2 : 00 p.m. and a reduction at 8 : 00 p.m. The inhibitory action of gamma-oryzanol was significant when stress was loaded for 6 hr from 2 : 00 a.m., 5 : 00 a.m., 11 : 00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. An 8-day treatment with gamma-oryzanol, 100 mg/kg, s.c., showed a significant inhibition of fasting ulcer, while the 5-day pretreatment exerted slight effects on ulcers by pylorus-ligation or stress-atropine. A 10-day treatment with the same dose of gamma-oyzanol in acetic acid ulcers lowered the serum level of gastrin. Treatment with reserpine, alpha-MT or PCPA prior to stress loading abolished the anti-ulcer effect of gamma-oryzanol, 100 mg/kg, s.c. for 5 days in stress ulcer. Treatment with L-DOPA or 5-HTP revealed a tendency toward restoration of the anti-ulcer effect of gamma-oryzanol. It is suggested that the monoaminergic neuron system is involved in the anti-ulcer action of gamma-oryzanol.",
