      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: After spinal cord injury (SCI), poor dorsiflexor control and involuntary plantar-flexor contraction impair walking. As whole-body vibration (WBV) improves voluntary muscle activation and modulates reflex excitability, it may improve ankle control. In this study, the dosage effects of WBV on walking speed, dorsiflexion, and spinal reflex excitability were examined. METHODS: Sixteen people with chronic motor-incomplete SCI participated in this randomized sham-control wash-in study. Two weeks of sham stimulation (wash-in phase) were followed by either 2 weeks of eight repetitions (short bout) or sixteen repetitions of WBV (long bout; intervention phase) per session. Walking speed, ankle angle at mid-swing, and low-frequency depression of the soleus H-reflex were measured before and after the wash-in phase and before and after the intervention phase. RESULTS: A significant dosage effect of WBV was not observed on any of the measures of interest. There were no between-phase or within-phase differences in ankle angle during the swing phase or in low-frequency depression. When dosage groups were pooled together, there was a significant change in walking speed during the intervention phase (mean = 0.04 m/s, standard deviation = 0.06, p = 0.02). There was not a significant correlation between overall change in walking speed and dorsiflexion angle or low-frequency depression during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body vibration did not have a dosage-dependent effect on dorsiflexion during the swing phase or on spinal reflex excitability. Future studies assessing the role of corticospinal tract (CST) descending drive on increased dorsiflexor ability and walking speed are warranted."

      "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that athletes recovering from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction experience a decline in motor cortex excitability and injury-related cortical reorganization, potentially leading to ongoing complications and a higher risk of subsequent injuries. Therefore, incorporating an intervention that consistently delivers sensory inputs to the central nervous system and enhances excitability at both spinal and supra-spinal levels, in addition to exercise therapy, may offer greater benefits. The purpose of this study was to explore whether combining whole body vibration (WBV) with exercise therapy enhances motor cortical excitability in athletes undergoing ACL reconstruction more effectively than exercise therapy alone. Additionally, it aimed to assess whether this combination improves quadriceps strength and reduces functional limitations in daily activities. This study is a randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. Twenty-six participants were assigned to either the WBV plus exercise therapy group (intervention group) or the exercise therapy-only group (control group). Outcome measures, assessed before and after treatment, included motor cortex excitability [active motor threshold (AMT) and motor-evoked potential amplitude of the quadriceps], isometric peak torque of the quadriceps, and daily functional disabilities using the knee outcome survey activities of daily living scale (KOS-ADL scale). The treatment period consisted of 12 sessions (4 weeks, with 3 sessions per week). A two-way mixed ANOVA was conducted to examine the main effects of group, time and their interactions. The results showed that in the intervention group (WBV plus exercise therapy), AMT significantly decreased (F(1, 12) = 11.35, P = 0.006, η2 = 0.486), while the control group (exercise therapy only) showed no significant change (F(1, 12) = 0.252, P = 0.625, η2 = 0.021). In the intervention group, AMT decreased by 19.47% post-treatment. Both groups showed significant improvements in isometric peak torque and KOS-ADL scores (P < 0.001), with large effect sizes for these parameters. The study concluded that adding WBV to exercise therapy is more effective in increasing motor cortex excitability compared to exercise therapy alone. However, since both groups showed significant improvements in quadriceps peak torque and KOS-ADL scores, it suggests that the addition of WBV did not provide substantial added benefits in enhancing quadriceps strength and improving daily functional abilities. The observed improvements may primarily be attributed to exercise therapy. Nonetheless, it is important to consider the small sample size and low statistical power when interpreting these results.RCT registration: On the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20220220054078N1).",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis of the knee (KOA) is a leading cause of disability in the aging population. The treatment of choice in most stages is a conservative multimodal approach. Previous studies were able to prove the efficiency of physical therapy for improvement. Therefore physical therapy, besides pain medication, is one of the most common used forms of therapy for KOA. This study aims to evaluate the possible efficiency of whole-body vibration (WBV) compared to physical therapy. This might benefit patients to whom physical therapy is not accessible. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with primary Gonarthrosis grade II or III were recruited. Included patients were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was treated by physical therapy and the other one with WBV. Treatment duration was six weeks. An Intention-to-Treat analysis was performed. Effectiveness was evaluated by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Committee (OMERACT) and Short-Form-Health-Survey 12 (SF-12) at seven, twelve and 26 weeks. RESULTS: Of 51 patients recruited, 39 patients were finally included. Overall, both treatments were able to show improvements. The SF-12 Score was improved in both groups without significant difference (p = 0.487). The conventional group showed insignificant vaster pain reduction (p = 0.926). Whereas WBV resulted in insignificant improved function (p = 0.144), reduced stiffness (p = 0.931) and improved total score (p = 0.295). Response to therapy reduced over time in both groups. Although more patients of the WBV group reported improvement of their general health status, average improvement was better at the conventional group. CONCLUSIONS: This study was able to show that, for the conservative treatment of knee osteoarthritis grade II and III, WBV is a non-inferior therapy compared to conventional physiotherapy. Both were able to improve the status of the patients and may be used based on the accessibility and preferences of affected patients.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although whole-body vibration (WBV) is often employed alongside traditional physical therapies to treat cerebral palsy, its effects on motor function remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of WBV either alone or in combination with other therapies in children with cerebral palsy, compared with control groups that underwent traditional physical therapy or remained untreated. METHODS: We analyzed randomized controlled trials published up to September 2024 that assessed motor function in WBV and control groups, including those receiving conventional physical therapy or no intervention. Articles were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. The random-effects model was used to analyze the outcomes of these trials. RESULTS: Our search yielded 23 studies involving 729 participants. Compared with the control group, the WBV group exhibited significantly greater improvements in walking speed (pooled mean difference: 14.26 cm/s [95% CI = 6.45 to 22.08 cm/s]), Timed \"Up & Go\" Test results (pooled mean difference = -2.52 seconds [95% CI = -3.66 to -1.37 seconds]), Gross Motor Function Measure scores (total score: pooled mean difference = 0.69 [95% CI = 0.30 to 1.08]; dimension D: pooled mean difference = 3.41 [95% CI = 0.53 to 6.29]; dimension E: pooled mean difference = 3.28 [95% CI = 1.36 to 5.20]), and overall stability index values (standardized mean difference = -1.20 [95% CI = -2.28 to -0.11]). The Modified Ashworth Scale results varied between the muscle groups, and no intolerable adverse effects of WBV were reported. CONCLUSION: WBV improves postural control and motor performance in children with cerebral palsy by enhancing walking speed, Timed \"Up & Go\" Test performance, and gross motor function without causing intolerable adverse effects. However, the certainty of the current evidence on the topic is very low or low. Additional well-structured trials are required to determine the optimal intensity of WBV treatment. IMPACT: Given its therapeutic benefits and safety, WBV may be considered as an adjunctive therapy for managing cerebral palsy, particularly for children with spastic cerebral palsy."

      "abstract": "The acute effects of exercise can elucidate the molecular and psychophysiological mechanisms underlying exercise's benefits in several systems (e.g., the brain, muscle, and bone). In this study, a single 30-minute session of high-intensity interval aerobic exercise (HIIAE) administered in conjunction with isometric resistance exercise on a whole-body vibration (WBV) platform (HIIAE+WBV) was compared with HIIAE alone in their effects on molecular and neurocognitive indices among 63 sedentary, healthy postmenopausal women who were randomly assigned to HIIAE (n = 20), HIIAE+WBV (n = 20), and Control (n = 23) groups. The assessed molecular indices were serum levels of osteocalcin (OC), uncarboxylated OC (ucOC), carboxylated OC (cOC), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and irisin, and the assessed neurocognitive indices were the accuracy rate (AR), reaction time (RT), and electroencephalography event-related potentials (ERPs) of P2 and P3 components in a visuospatial working memory task. Data on these indices before versus after an acute bout of HIIAE or HIIAE+WBV or after a resting session were compared. An HIIAE or HIIAE+WBV intervention yielded no significant change in ERP P2 latency/amplitude and P3 latency but yielded significantly higher ARs, shorter RTs, larger ERP P3 amplitudes, and higher OC, cOC, BDNF, and irisin levels in the postmenopausal women. HIIAE+WBV outperformed HIIAE alone in AR, ucOC, and BDNF. However, the changes in these molecular and neurocognitive indices induced by the two exercise modes did not show any significant correlations in the present study. The present findings suggest that HIIAE and HIIAE+WBV have the potential to acutely influence markers of bone and brain health, with HIIAE+WBV showing greater effectiveness than HIIAE alone. These interventions should be further investigated in future randomized controlled trials involving postmenopausal women.",

We examined the effects of an 8-week WBV exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), muscular strength (MS) and body composition in young women. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-six inactive women with overweight and obesity (age: 30.2 ± 8.0 years, BMI: 25.7 ± 1.9 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to WBV exercise (n = 13) or control (n = 13) groups. The WBV exercise group participated in static and dynamic exercises on a vibration platform (3 sessions/week, 60 min/session) for 8 weeks. The control group maintained their usual lifestyle without structured exercise. CRF was measured by VO2peak and MS index was measured by the 1-RM (kg) for the chest and leg press, expressed relative to body weight (kg). Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Of the 26 participants randomized, 23 participants (13 WBV and 10 controls) completed the intervention, with 94.2 % exercise adherence rate. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the WBV exercise group had reductions (p < 0.05 for all) in body weight (-2.4 kg), BMI (-0.9 kg/m2), body fat (-2.8 kg) and waist circumference (-3.5 cm) compared to the control group. VO2peak (pre: 27.9 ± 4.8 vs. post: 30.7 ± 4.4 ml/kg/min, p = 0.005) and MS index (pre: 2.0 ± 0.4 vs. post: 3.0 ± 0.7, p < 0.001) increased in the WBV exercise group, but not in the control group. CONCLUSION: WBV exercise is effective for improving fitness and body fat in young women with overweight and obesity.",

Previous studies have demonstrated benefits of whole-body vibration in older adults. However, prolonged use of this modality of exercise may be detrimental to certain conditions. Objectives: to verify the acute effects of a single whole-body vibration session on mobility and postural control in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: In this two-arm, single-blind clinical trial, fifty-two participants were randomly allocated to either the experimental (subject to a single whole-body vibration session with a vibration amplitude of 2 mm and a frequency of 40 Hz) or placebo group. The exercise sessions were conducted using a tri-planar vibration platform. The tri-plane plates were adjusted to vibrate up and down, side to side, and front to back. The assessments included mobility and postural control tests. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were performed to examine the main effect of group (experimental vs. placebo), time (baseline vs. after the intervention), and group × time interaction effect. Significance was set at 5%. Results: Compared with the placebo group, participants who underwent whole-body vibration showed positive outcomes in terms of mobility (p = 0.014, effect size: 0.115). Contrastingly, no significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of postural control (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Benefits of a single whole-body vibration session were observed on mobility. Using whole-body vibration to improve postural control may require additional sessions. Contraindications typical of aging should be taken into account."

Whole-body vibration (WBV) is a potential noninvasive therapy to address these challenges. This review aimed to determine and document the quality and extent of WBV therapy benefits in the elderly, as reported in the literature. OVID, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for peer-reviewed articles written in English between January 2008 and November 2024. Included were articles involving WBV effects on cardiovascular hemodynamics, neuromuscular stability, and sarcopenia in persons aged 50 and older. The initial search yielded 467 articles, and 37 were included for final review. The reported cardiovascular benefits of WBV included increased skin blood flow and improved markers of endothelial cell function. Mixed results exist for arterial stiffness metrics, and there was no significant impact of WBV on blood pressure. The most promising evidence relates to sarcopenia, where significant improvements were reported in muscle strength, performance, and functionality. Elderly persons with osteoarthritis had similar results, in addition to reduced pain and stiffness. Patients with Parkinson's disease were reported to have improvements in tremor, rigidity, and postural stability. In contrast, stroke patients had mixed results in muscle activation but showed improvement in ankle joint proprioception. We conclude that although there is some evidence supporting the benefits of WBV on heart rate, muscle strength, function, and arterial stiffness, contradictory findings are reported. This points to the need for further research and a better definition of the optimal dosage of WBV, including its amplitude and frequency."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: End-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients awaiting total knee replacement (TKR) often experience prolonged wait times and worsening symptoms. Whole-body vibration (WBV) has shown potential benefits in OA management. This study compared the efficacy of supervised exercise therapy alone and combined with WBV in reducing pain and improving function in this population. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 555 patients with end-stage knee OA awaiting TKR were allocated to three groups: Exercise (n = 227), Exercise + WBV (n = 127), and Control (n = 201). The Exercise and Exercise + WBV groups underwent an 8-week intervention comprising strength and flexibility exercises. Primary outcomes were pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale, NPRS) and function (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, KOOS). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the final treatment session. Statistical analysis included ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction for baseline comparisons and paired t-tests for longitudinal comparisons. Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) and Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were calculated to assess the clinical significance of the results. RESULTS: Both exercise modalities significantly reduced knee pain from baseline to final session (P < 0.001). The Exercise + WBV group showed a larger reduction in NPRS score (mean ± standard deviation (SD); from 5.57 ± 1.82 to 4.65 ± 2.15) compared to the Exercise group (from 5.35 ± 2.11 to 4.88 ± 1.96), exceeding both MCID (0.94 vs. 0.45) and MDC (0.34 vs. 0.27) thresholds. The Exercise + WBV group demonstrated significant improvements in KOOS subscales (KOOS-KP: 54.31 ± 16.95 to 60.04 ± 17.13, P < 0.001; KOOS-S: 57.27 ± 19.56 to 60.50 ± 18.07, P = 0.033; KOOS-ADL: 66.99 ± 19.42 to 71.52 ± 16.32, P = 0.003), while the Exercise group did not. These improvements in KOOS subscales met or exceeded the MDC (ranging from 2.42 to 3.99) but showed variable clinical significance relative to MCID (- 0.49 to 0.04). The Exercise + WBV group also showed significant improvement in knee ROM (110.68° ± 16.52° to 115.43° ± 18.59°, P < 0.001), while the Exercise group did not. CONCLUSION: Both interventions effectively reduced pain and improved function in end-stage knee OA patients awaiting TKR, with the addition of WBV leading to greater improvements in several outcomes. Particularly in pain reduction, changes exceeded both MCID and MDC thresholds, suggesting WBV's potential as a clinically valuable adjunct to exercise therapy. While some improvements in functional outcomes were statistically significant and surpassed MDC values, their clinical significance varied, future research should focus on optimizing WBV protocols and investigating long-term effects to guide clinical practice in managing patients awaiting TKR."

The participants were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 (n=22) received WBV+HBE, Group 2 (n=22) received WBV+PTM+HBE, and Group 3 (n=21) received PTM+HBE alone. The primary outcome measure was functional physical performance, while the secondary outcome measures were pain intensity and functional status. All the measurements were evaluated by a single blinded investigator before and after treatment. RESULTS: All the functional physical performance tests (p<0.01), pain intensity (p<0.01), and functional status (p<0.01) showed statistically significant effects in terms of time and group × time interaction, but no significant difference was observed among the groups (p>0.05). We observed statistically and clinically significant improvement in all of the functional physical performance tests, pain, and functional status for Group 2. There was a statistically and clinically significant improvement only in the functional physical performance tests for Group 1. In Group 3, no clinical or statistical significance was achieved in any outcome measurements. CONCLUSION: Treatment program consisting of WBV+PTM+HBE can yield clinically and statistically favorable results by improving all of the pain, functional status and physical performance parameters of the patients with knee OA, while WBV+HBE can be clinically and statistically effective only in the physical performance parameters of the patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to analyze the effect of high-frequency, low-magnitude whole-body vibration (WBV) therapy in horizontal position on bone, quality of life, pain, and balance in postmenopausal women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty postmenopausal women were included in this prospective, randomized controlled study between May 2015 to September 2015. The patients were randomized into three groups, with 20 participants in each group: (i) WBV + infrared group, (ii) infrared group, and (iii) control group. Bone mineral density of the lumbar and femoral regions of all the patients was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In addition, osteocalcin and hydroxyproline values were measured. Quality of life was assessed using the Short Form-36, pain was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale, and balance was assessed based on the participants' performance in the Berg balance test. RESULTS: Seven patients (two from the vibration + infrared group and five from the infrared group) could not continue the study, and the analyses were conducted with the remaining 53 patients (mean age: 56.9±5.1 years; range, 45 to 65 years). At the end of a three-month treatment period, no statistically significant difference was found in bone mineral density, bone turnover markers, pain, and quality of life of the patients in all three groups compared to the pretreatment values. Berg balance test results showed a statistically significant increase after treatment in all three groups. CONCLUSION: High-frequency, low-magnitude WBV performed under supervision in postmenopausal women was not found to be effective in improving bone, quality of life, pain, and balance. Future studies for determining effective vibration protocols having a longer duration and higher frequency of sessions are warranted."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of whole-body vibration training (WBVT) and resistance training (RT) on body composition, muscle strength, physical performance and blood biomarkers in older people with sarcopenia. We conducted a 12-week, 3-times-weekly assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial of 27 older people with sarcopenia aged ≥ 65 years. Subjects were randomized into WBVT group (n = 14) and RT group (n = 13). The primary outcome was knee extension strength (KES). Secondary outcomes were body composition [body weight, body mass index (BMI), percentage of body fat (PBF), and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI)], muscle strength [handgrip strength (HS)], physical performance [gait speed (GS), 5-time chair stand test (5CST), and short physical performance battery (SPPB)], blood biomarkers (inflammatory factors, hormones, growth factors, and muscle injury biomarker), and quality of life questionnaire [medical outcomes study short-form 36 (SF-36)]. After 12-week intervention, in the WBVT group, we observed significant improvements in body composition (weight, BMI, PBF and ASMI), muscle strength (KES), physical performance (GS, SPPB and 5CST), blood biomarkers [insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), growth hormone, follistatin (FST) and creatine kinase (CK)] and quality of life. In the RT group, we observed significant improvements in body composition (weight, BMI and PBF), muscle strength (KES), physical performance (GS and SPPB), blood biomarkers (growth hormone, FST and CK) and quality of life. Between-group comparisons were only significant for KES (P = 0.007) and the role-physical (RP) dimension of the SF-36 (P = 0.007). WBVT and RT both improved the physical condition of older people with sarcopenia. RT excelled in muscle strength, but WBVT offered an alternative for those with restrictions. WBVT's low risk and flexibility suited diverse conditions, providing a new rehabilitation option for patients with sarcopenia.",

OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of Whole-body vibration Without Visual Feedback (VFDWBV) on postural steadiness in unilateral traumatic trans- femoral amputees. METHODS: A double-blinded randomized controlled study of technology and information was conducted at a modern university. A total of 108 individuals, 40-55 years who had experienced a traumatic amputation of one leg above the knee were divided into three groups: group A received whole body vibration (WBV) with their eyes opened, group B received (VFDWBV), and group C received conservative treatment only. The stability of the prosthetic leg, stability limit, and sway index (m-CTSIB) were assessed at the beginning and after 12 weeks. Sessions occurred three times each week. RESULTS: Significant statistical differences were seen in the stability of prosthetic legs, the limit of stability, and (m-CTSIB) between groups A and B, considering the treatment interaction (F = 24.8, p = 0.001). Additionally, the group receiving VFDWBV showed a more significant improvement in postural steadiness than those receiving WBV and the control group. CONCLUSION: Utilizing VFDWBV at a frequency of 30 HZ can significantly enhance the stability of posture in individuals with unilateral traumatic trans-femoral amputations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with the Clinical Trials.gov (NCT06284733).",

Interventions for lumbar motor control are complex and difficult; however, training with whole-body vibrations has the potential to be simple and effective. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the effects of 4 weeks of trunk training with whole-body vibrations on each component of lumbar motor control. This single-blind, randomized controlled trial recruited 24 healthy university students (12 males and 12 females) who were randomized to undergo either whole-body or non-whole-body vibration training. The lumbar motion angle and angular jerk cost were measured during each lumbar motor control task (pelvic tilting, ball-catching, and quadruped rocking). There was a significant group × period interaction for the lumbar spine motion angle in the anterior pelvic tilt; however, no significant group × period interaction was observed in the other tasks. Regarding the comparison of pre- and post-intervention outcomes in the whole-body vibration training group, the lumbar spine motion angle of the anterior pelvic tilt was significantly smaller post-intervention than pre-intervention. In the ball-catching task, the lumbar spine motion angle was significantly smaller post-intervention than pre-intervention. Backward rocking resulted in a significantly greater lumbar spine motion angle post-intervention than pre-intervention. In conclusion, whole-body vibration enhances the control of decreasing lumbar motion. However, it does not improve all components of lumbar motor control and should be considered based on the target component.",

      "abstract": "Whole-body vibration (WBV) is a physical stimulation method that transmits mechanical oscillations to the entire body through a vibration platform or device. Biokinetic and epidemiologic studies have shown that prolonged exposure to high-intensity WBV increases health risks, primarily to the lumbar spine and the nervous system connected to it. There is currently insufficient evidence to demonstrate a quantitative relationship between vibration exposure and risk of health effects. The positive effects of WBV on increasing muscle strength and improving balance and flexibility are well known, but its effects on cognitive function are more complex, with mixed findings, largely related to vibration conditions, including frequency, amplitude, and duration. Studies have shown that short-term low-frequency WBV may have a positive impact on cognitive function, demonstrates potential rehabilitation benefits in enhancing learning and memory, possibly by promoting neuromuscular coordination and enhancing neural plasticity. However, long term exposure to vibration may lead to chronic stress in nerve tissue, affecting nerve conduction efficiency and potentially interfering with neuroprotective mechanisms, thereby having a negative impact on cognitive ability, even causes symptoms such as cognitive decline, mental fatigue, decreased attention, and drowsiness. This literature review aimed to explore the effects of WBV on cognitive function and further to analyze the possible mechanisms. Based on the analysis of literatures, we came to the conclusion that the impact of WBV on cognitive function depends mainly on the frequency and duration of vibration, short-term low-frequency WBV may have a positive impact on cognitive function, while long term exposure to WBV may lead to cognitive decline, and the mechanisms may be involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmitter changes. This review may provide some theoretical foundations and guidance for the prevention and treatment of WBV induced cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whole-body vibration (WBV) training has emerged as an alternative exercise modality for individuals unable to participate in regular physical activity. While previous studies demonstrated positive effects of WBV on physical outcomes, its impact on cognition remains relatively unexplored, despite studies suggesting cognitive benefits. This study aims to investigate the cortical activation patterns in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during WBV and a subsequent cognitive task. METHODS: Oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) levels in the brain were measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Stroop Color-Word Interference (CWIT) and Color-Block test (CBT). Twenty-four participants (21.50 ± 1.59 years, 11 female) were randomly assigned to one of twelve balanced orders, involving different frequencies (24 Hz, 12 Hz, control) and postures (sitting or standing) on a side-alternating vibration plate. RESULTS: HbO2 levels were lower at 12 and 24 Hz versus control, most prominently in the left DLPFC. During the CWIT, HbO2 levels tended to be higher after WBV versus control. CWIT performance significantly improved after WBV versus control at 12 Hz in sitting posture, and at 12 and 24 Hz in standing posture. CONCLUSION: Our results point towards decreased cortical activation during WBV, especially in the left DLPFC, but beneficial effects as a consequence of WBV expressed in increased activation during the CWIT and improved cognitive performance, indicating cognitive readiness. These results underscore the potential efficacy of WBV as a cognitive-enhancing therapy. Replicating these findings in older adults would enhance the study's generalizability and practical implications.",

Gamma oscil2lations at 40 Hz have been identified as a potential therapeutic approach for age-related cognitive decline and can be induced through various modalities, including auditory, visual, electrical, and magnetic stimulation. In this study, we investigated a novel modality of stimulation: whole-body vibration at 40 Hz. We examined the effects of 40 Hz vibration on cognitive performance and associated neuronal activity in the brains of aged male rats. Our findings revealed that only vibration at 40 Hz, rather than 20 Hz or 80 Hz, elicited cortical gamma oscillations in aged male rats. Additionally, following 8 weeks of prolonged treatment, the implementation of 40 Hz whole-body vibration significantly augmented the cognitive function of aged male rats as evidenced by behavioral assessments. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that these beneficial effects were attributed to the reduction of neuronal apoptosis in hippocampal CA1 through regulation of synaptic connections between astrocytes and neurons via 40 Hz gamma oscillations. Collectively, this suggests a promising intervention for age-related cognitive decline and identifies neuron-astrocyte synapses as potential therapeutic targets.",

However, there is still limited knowledge regarding the impact of this combined therapy on osseointegration in elderly individuals. Objective: The objective of this study was to verify the influence of WBV and SIM combination treatment on Titanium implants' fixation strength in aged rats. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats at 24 months old were utilized for this investigation. Titanium rods were surgically inserted into the distal femoral canal on their left side. Subsequently, all animals were randomly assigned to one of four groups: Control group; WBV group; SIM group; and WBV + SIM group. Each group received Saline, Whole Body Vibration, Simvastatin, or a combination of Whole Body Vibration plus Simvastatin treatment until they reached their natural death after 12 weeks. The bilateral femurs and serum samples from these rats were collected for evaluation purposes. RESULTS: Both WBV and SIM treatments exhibited an increase in bone mass, osseointegration, and push-out force compared to the Control group (all, P < 0.05). Additionally, levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory factors decreased with both treatments when compared to the Control group alone (all, P < 0.05). Notably, the WBV + SIM group displayed superior effects on new bone formation, biomechanical strength, BMP2 expression in bone tissue as well as SOD2 expression regulation related to bone repair genes when compared to other groups involved in this study (all, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that combining physiotherapy (WBV) with drug therapy (SIM) proves beneficial for enhancing implant fixation in aged rats."

This pilot randomized crossover trial (UMIN000036520) aimed to investigate the changes in plasma HX after whole-body vibration exercise (WBVE) and their relationships with body composition and muscle-related parameters, enrolling eighteen healthy male volunteers. In the WBVE-alone intervention, the study subjects performed 20-min of WBVE. In the OGTT → WBVE intervention, a 75-g oral glucose load (OGL) was administered 30 min prior to the start of the WBVE intervention. Blood samples were collected before the start and 10 min after the end of WBVE in both interventions. WBVE resulted in a significant increase in plasma HX levels, which was accompanied by increased blood ammonia, pyruvic acid, and lactic acid levels. The HX increase following WBVE was suppressed by prior OGL. In the WBVE-alone intervention, there were no significant correlations between the post-WBVE changes in plasma HX (ΔHX) levels and any of the clinical parameters. On the other hand, in the OGTT → WBVE intervention, ΔHX showed significant negative correlations with muscle mass (ρ = -0.62, p = 0.01), strength (ρ = -0.71, p = 0.005), and muscle quality (ρ = -0.81, p = 0.0007) in the legs. In conclusion, these findings suggest possible associations between post-WBVE increases in plasma HX levels and muscle status, particularly under the glucose-supplemented condition. The measurement of plasma HX concentrations following WBVE may have clinical applications in the identification of high-risk populations for sarcopenia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Enhancing joint range of motion is regarded as one of the most long-term goals in the management of cerebral palsy (CP). With CP, there are well-documented changes in the neurological drive to skeletal muscle, which leads to modifications in the architecture of the muscles. Whole-body vibration (WBV) is one intervention to modify muscle and joint. However, its efficacy needs to be accurately studied. This study investigates the effects of WBV on fascicle length, knee joint angle and function in children with spastic hemiplegic CP. METHODS: Eighty children with hemiplegic CP aged 4-6 years were enrolled. Participants were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The control group received a designated physical therapy program and the experimental group received a designated physical therapy program in addition to WBV. Program was performed 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Goniometry, ultrasonography and gross motor function measurements were used to measure knee extension joint angle, fascicle length of hamstrings and function, respectively. RESULTS: The results of this study indicated that, designed physical therapy program with WBV could increase the active range of motion in knee extension (p = 0.001) and fascicle length of hamstring (p = 0.001) muscles as well as improve function in children with hemiplegic CP (p = 0.001). IMPLICATION FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY PRACTICE: According to the findings, the use of WBV can be considered as an effective treatment in increasing the range of motion of knee extension and fascicle length and finally improving function in children with CP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) is a prevalent condition causing significant disability and functional impairment. Whole-body vibration exercise (WBVE) has emerged as a new treatment method, but additional research is necessary to determine the optimal parameters of WBVE that would be beneficial for patients experiencing chronic low back pain (CLBP). This study aims to investigate the effects of two type of WBVE (constant vs progressive) on pain, disability, functional performance, and muscle activity in patients with NSCLBP. METHODS: Thirty-two individuals diagnosed with chronic low back pain (CLBP) without any specific causes were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups: a constant/fixed protocol WBVE group or a progressive protocol WBVE group. Participants underwent WBVE sessions for around 30 min, thrice weekly over a period of 8 weeks. Primary outcomes assessed included pain intensity, functional disability, functional performance, and electromyographic activity of core musculature, measured at baseline and upon completion of the intervention period. Temporal changes of each outcome variable across different periods and between groups were measured with repeated measures 2×2 mixed ANOVA. Further, the paired t-test was performed to compare pre- and post-treatment values within each group. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in both the constant and progressive WBVE protocol groups. Pain intensity decreased by 64.2% (p < 0.001) in the constant group and by 61.1% (p < 0.001) in the progressive group. Functional disability decreased by 48.1% (p < 0.001) in the constant group and by 53.3% (p < 0.001) in the progressive group. Functional performance improved by 16.5% (p < 0.001) in the constant group and by 16.9% (p < 0.001) in the progressive group. Electromyography (EMG) demonstrated significant improvements across all measured variables except % maximum voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) of external obliques (EO) in both intervention groups with time (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the magnitude of improvement between the constant and progressive WBVE protocols (p > 0.05), indicating both modalities' effectiveness in ameliorating CLBP symptoms and associated functional impairments. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that both progressive and constant WBVE protocols are equally effective in reducing pain and disability in NSCLBP patients. These findings support the inclusion of progressive WBVE in clinical practice, offering a flexible treatment option that can be tailored to individual patient needs, ensuring both tolerability and effectiveness. This contributes valuable evidence towards optimizing WBVE protocols for managing NSCLBP.",

Relevant data from included studies were extracted. The methodological quality was evaluated for each study included by PEDro scale, risk of bias (Cochrane Collaboration's tool), and the level of evidence by National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). RESULTS: Six randomized clinical trial (RCT) were included. In respect of the level of evidence, all studies were classified as Level II (NHMRC) and regarding to the methodological quality (PEDro scale), four studies were considered 'high' and two were 'fair'. Two publications presented low risk of bias, three with high risk of bias and one unclear. All the selected studies reported positive effects and improvements on risk of falls and muscle response after WBV exercise. CONCLUSION: WBV exercise may contribute to reduce the risk of falls and improve muscle responses in the elderly individuals."

The effect that whole body vibration (WBV) generates on the organism could be recommended in Diabetes Mellitus 2 (DM 2) patients. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze the available evidence on the effects of WBV on glycemic control in patients with DM 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exhaustive bibliographic searches were carried out until October 2023 in different biomedical portals and databases: Public Medline (PubMed), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), VHL Regional Portal, Cochrane Central and Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (LILACS). Randomized clinical trials based on the effects of Whole Body Vibration on glycosylated hemoglobin levels, with control group and participants were non-insulin dependent were the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers extracted data independently. A third reviewer was available for discrepancies. RESULTS: Six articles with 223 participants met the criteria and were included in the systematic review; only four of them met the criteria to be part of the meta-analysis. This meta-analysis reveals a positive and significant effect size (μ ê=0.5731), indicating a substantial difference between the groups studied. Although there is some variability between studies (heterogeneity of 30.05%), the overall direction of the effects is consistent. These findings conclusively suggest the presence of a significant influence of the variable evaluated, underscoring the robustness and consistency of the relationship observed in the literature reviewed. CONCLUSION: There are no conclusive results due to the lack of data for some variables, which prevents comparison; but WBV may be an effective therapy to improve glycemic control in DM 2 patients. More studies with more patients and longer follow-up are needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although whole-body vibration (WBV) training is acknowledged for its benefits in enhancing motor functions across several neurological disorders, its precise influence on ankle joint proprioception and balance in stroke patients is still not well understood. This research seeks to assess the impact of WBV training on ankle joint proprioception and balance in stroke patients, thereby filling this important research void. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, thirty-five stroke patients were randomly assigned to either the WBV group (n = 17) or a control group (n = 18) using a random number table method. The control group received daily general rehabilitation for four weeks, while the WBV group received an additional 30 min of WBV training each day with the Trunsan S110 Vibration Training System. Blinded outcome assessments were conducted at baseline and post-treatment, utilizing the Berg balance scale (BBS), Functional reach test (FRT), Romberg test length (RTL) and area (RTA), and completion rates of ankle joint dorsiflexion-plantar flexion (DP) and inversion-eversion (IE) tests. Follow-up assessments were performed after four weeks of intervention, focusing on RTL, RTA, DP, and IE as primary outcomes. RESULTS: Analysis of intra-group changes from baseline to post-treatment revealed significant improvements across the BBS, FRT, RTL, RTA, and DP and IE assessments (p < 0.001). Notably, the WBV group showed significant enhancements compared to the control group in DP and IE (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively), with mean values increasing from 13.556 to 16.765 (23.7%) and from 5.944 to 8.118 (36.6%), respectively. However, WBV did not provide additional benefits over the control treatment for balance recovery parameters such as BBS, FRT, RTL, and RTA (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that WBV therapy is equally effective as conventional methods in enhancing proprioception and balance in stroke patients, but it does not provide additional benefits for balance recovery. WBV significantly improves proprioceptive functions, particularly in DP and IE parameters. However, it does not surpass traditional rehabilitation methods in terms of balance recovery. These findings indicate that WBV should be incorporated into stroke rehabilitation primarily to enhance proprioception rather than to optimize balance recovery.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteo-sarcopenia (OS) has become a global public health problem and a frontier research problem, as a combination of sarcopenia (SP) and osteoporosis (OP) diseases. The clinical performances include muscle weakness, systemic bone pain, standing difficulty, even falls and fractures, etc., which seriously affect the patient's life and work. The pathological mechanism of the OS may be the abnormal metabolism which disrupts the equilibrium stability of the musculoskeletal system. Therefore, this study combined vitamin D (Vit. D) and whole-body vibration training (WBVT) to intervene in subjects of OS, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the diagnosis and treatment protocol and to explore the efficacy mechanism. METHODS: We propose a multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vit. D combined with WBVT intervention in OS. Subjects who met the inclusion or exclusion criteria and signed the informed consent form would be randomly assigned to the WBVT group, Vit. D group, or WBVT+ Vit. D group. All subjects will be treated for 1 month and followed up after 3 and 6 months. The primary outcomes are lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and handgrip strength measured by grip strength meter. Secondary outcomes include serum markers of myostatin (MSTN), irisin and bone turnover markers (BTM), SARC-CalF questionnaire, 1-min test question of osteoporosis risk, patient health status (evaluated by the SF-36 health survey), physical performance measurement that includes 5-time chair stand test, 6-m walk, and the short physical performance battery (SPPB). DISCUSSION: If Vit. D combined with WBVT can well relieve OS symptoms without adverse effects, this protocol may be a new treatment strategy for OS. After therapeutic intervention, if the serum marker MSTN/irisin is significant, both have the potential to become sensitive indicators for screening OS effective drugs and treatments, which also indicates that WBVT combined with Vit. D plays a role in improving OS by regulating MSTN/irisin. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2400082269 . Registered on March 26, 2024.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) often fail to return to their previous level of sport performance. Although multifaceted, this inability to regain preinjury performance may be influenced by impaired plyometric ability attributable to chronic quadriceps dysfunction. Whole-body vibration (WBV) acutely improves quadriceps function and biomechanics after ACLR, but its effects on jumping performance outcomes such as jump height, the reactive strength index (RSI), and knee work and power are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute effects of WBV on measures of jumping performance in those with ACLR. DESIGN: Crossover study design. SETTING: Research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six individuals with primary, unilateral ACLR. INTERVENTION(S): Participants stood on a WBV platform in a mini-squat position while vibration or no vibration (control) was applied during six 60-second bouts with 2 minutes of rest between bouts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Double-leg jumping tasks were completed preintervention and postintervention (WBV or control) and consisted of jumping off a 30-cm box to 2 force plates half the participant's height away. The jumping task required participants to maximally jump vertically upon striking the force plates. RESULTS: Whole-body vibration did not produce significant improvements in any of the study outcomes (ie, jump height, RSI, and knee work and power) in either limb (P = .053-.839). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a single bout of WBV is insufficient for improving jumping performance in individuals with ACLR. As such, using WBV to acutely improve jumping performance post-ACLR is likely not warranted. Future research should evaluate the effects of repeated exposure to WBV in combination with other plyometric interventions on jumping performance.",

      "abstract": "Karate athletes strategically use lower-limb techniques in combat, with the roundhouse kick (mawashi geri) being highly effective in kumite. To quickly improve the technical performance before training or competitions, conditioning activities (CAs) are often utilized. Recently, Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) has emerged as a potential conditioning activity (CA). This study aimed to analyze the acute effects of WBV as a CA on the performance of the mawashi geri. The sample included sixteen male karate athletes. The study had a familiarization and two experimental sessions: one with WBV and the other without (NWBV), conducted randomly and counterbalanced, each preceded and followed by a mawashi geri assessment on a force platform. During the CA intervention, the participants performed four sets of isometric half-squats on a vibration platform at a frequency of 26 Hz and an amplitude of 4 mm in the WBV condition, while the platform was off in the NWBV condition. A significant reduction in the mawashi geri attack phase time was observed under the WBV condition [pre: 0.31 ± 0.03 s; post: 0.30 ± 0.03 s] compared to the NWBV condition [pre: 0.31 ± 0.04 s; post: 0.32 ± 0.03 s] (p = 0.02). However, no differences were noted regarding the impact force or other kinetic variables between the conditions. Therefore, WBV did not increase the performance of the kinetic and kinematic variables of the mawashi geri in karate athletes, but it is possible that there is a positive effect on attack time, suggesting that further studies with different vibration protocol configurations would be beneficial."

The outcome measures were muscle strength, body composition, balance, and functional mobility of these patients. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Arksey and O'Malley framework. The literature review was conducted on PubMed. We included studies that were written in English, were peer-reviewed, without regard to the publication date, and implemented a form of \"vibration therapy\" or \"electrical stimulation\" or \"magnetic stimulation\" as an intervention program of any duration. Overall, 14 studies were retrieved. Most of the studies applied whole-body vibration (WBV) therapy or electrical stimulation and only one was found that implemented transcranial magnetic stimulation. The interventions were reported but there was a variety in duration or the frequency of the program, as well as in the disease progression of the patients. It seems that WBV, electrical stimulation, and magnetic stimulation have positive outcomes, but these vary depending on the muscle deficits and limitations of the patients with muscle dystrophy. It is recommended that future studies should be conducted in order to determine the ideal prescription of each intervention, so as to be as beneficial as possible."

However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for WBV induced ischemic protections remain elusive. In the current study, we hypothesize that post-stroke WBV initiates transcriptional reprogramming in the cortex of middle-aged female rats which is responsible for the observed reduced stroke consequences. Middle-aged female Sprague-Dawley rats that remained in constant diestrus (reproductively senescent) were randomized to either sham or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO; 90 min) surgery. A day after induction of tMCAO, animals received either WBV or no-WBV treatment for 15 min twice a day for five days for a week. Post-treatment, cortical tissue was analyzed for gene expression using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and gene enrichment analysis via Enrichr. The RNAseq data analysis revealed significant changes in gene expression due to WBV therapy and the differentially expressed genes are involved in variety of biological processes like neurogenesis, angiogenesis, excitotoxicity, and cell death. Specifically, observed significant up-regulation of 116 and down-regulation of 258 genes after WBV in tMCAO exposed rats as compared to the no-WBV group. The observed transcriptional reprogramming will identify the possible mechanism(s) responsible for post-stroke WBV conferred ischemic protection and future studies will be needed to confirm the role of the genes identified in the current study.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Compared to other subjects, obese people have inferior trunk muscle endurance and balance. A modern method of neuro-muscular training called whole body vibration (WBV) may improve trunk muscle endurance and balance. This study evaluates the impact of a 4-week WBV program on trunk endurance and balance in obese female students. Materials and Methods: Sixty participants from 18 to 25 years of age and with BMI values ≥ 30 were randomly distributed into two equal groups: Group A (WBV group), who received 4 min of WBV, and Group B (sham WBV group), who received WBV with a turn-off device. The training was conducted two days/week for six weeks. Trunk endurance was evaluated using the Sorensen Test (ST) and Trunk Flexor Endurance Test (TFET). The Single-Leg Test (SLT) was used to assess static balance, while the Biodex Stability System measured dynamic balance. Results: The current study demonstrated no significant differences (p > 0.05) in pre-treatment variables between Groups A and B. Post-treatment, Group A showed a significantly higher duration of the Sorensen test, TFET and SLS than Group B (p < 0.001). Moreover, Group A showed significantly lower dynamic balance (p < 0.001) than Group B. Conclusions: WBV has a short-term effect on trunk endurance and balance in obese female students. WBV can be added to the rehabilitation program for obese subjects with deficits in trunk endurance and balance.",

For a long time, studies have focused on the effects and applications of WBV to enhance musculoskeletal performance in athletes and patients suffering from musculoskeletal disorders. Recent evidence points toward the positive effect of WBV on the brain and its therapeutic potential in brain disorders. Research being done in the field gradually reveals cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying WBV affecting the body and brain. Particularly, the influence of WBV on immune and brain function is a growing field that warrants an up-to-date and integrated review. Immune function is closely intertwined with brain functioning and plays a significant role in various brain disorders. Dysregulation of the immune response is linked to conditions such as neuroinflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and mood disorders, highlighting the crucial connection between the immune system and the brain. This review aims to explore the impact of WBV on the cellular and molecular pathways involved in immune and brain functions. Understanding the effects of WBV at a cellular and molecular level will aid in optimizing WBV protocols to improve its therapeutic potential for brain disorders."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of integrating whole-body vibration training (WBVT) into conventional closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises as an intervention strategy for early knee osteoarthritis (KOA). METHODS: : This non-randomized comparative study conducted at an orthopedic clinic involved 53 patients (with Kellgren-Lawrence grades 1-2); 37 patients received only physical therapy (CKC group), and 16 patients received both physical therapy and WBVT (WBVT group). The primary outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) subscale score for pain, and the secondary outcomes were the WOMAC subscale score for physical function and muscle-strength assessments [isometric knee extension strength and the 30-second chair-stand test (CS-30) score]. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for bias between the control and intervention groups. RESULTS: : After PSM adjustment, 13 patients were selected from each group. The WBVT group showed a significant improvement in the WOMAC pain score (d=1.16, P=0.007) and a significant increase in the CS-30 score (d=0.81, P=0.049). However, for the WOMAC physical function score, the between-group difference remained statistically insignificant (d=0.59, P=0.146). CONCLUSIONS: : WBVT may be effective in reducing the pain of early KOA. WBVT is a non-invasive and convenient method, underscoring its potential as a novel therapeutic option."

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of WBV training in preventing falls and improving physical performance among older adults at fall risk. The study was an assessor- and participant-blinded, randomized, and controlled 10-week training trial with a 10-month follow-up. One hundred and thirty older adults (mean age 78.5 years, 75% women) were randomly allocated into the WBV group (n = 68) and the low-intensity wellness group (n = 62). Falls were prospectively collected using monthly returned and verified diaries. Physical performance was evaluated at baseline before randomization, after the intervention, and follow-up with established methods. The data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios for falls, and Cox regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratios for fallers. Between-group differences in physical performance were estimated by generalized linear mixed models. The retention rate was 93%, and the mean adherence to the WBV training was 88% and 86% to the wellness training. Sixty-eight participants fell at least once, and there were 156 falls in total. In the WBV group, the incidence rate of falls was 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.9 to 2.5) compared to the wellness group (p = 0.11). The hazard ratio for fallers in the WBV group was 1.29 (0.78 to 2.15) (p = 0.32). There was no between-group difference in physical performance after the training period, but by the end of the follow-up, WBV-related benefits appeared. The chair-rising capacity was maintained in the WBV group, while the benefit disappeared in the wellness group (p = 0.004). Also, the 0.5-point difference in short physical performance battery (SPPB) score favored WBV training (p = 0.009). In conclusion, progressive side-alternating WBV training was feasible and well-tolerated among fall-prone older adults. During the one-year follow-up, WBV training was associated with improved physical performance but did not prevent falls compared to chair-based group exercises.",

This study aimed to compare the effects of whole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) in weight bearing and non-weight bearing positions for the upper and lower extremities on balance and cervical joint position sense in children with spastic CP. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was carried out on 60 hemiplegic children with spastic CP aged 5-15 years. Following randomization, all participants were allocated into six equal-sized groups based on the application of WBVT for upper extremities, lower extremities, or both simultaneously in either weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing positions. Pediatric balance scale (PBS) and laser tracker system were used to assess functional balance and cervical joint position sense. RESULTS: One-way analysis of variance for Inter-group analysis showed a statistically significant difference among all groups in PBS and cervical joint position sense (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: WBVT was found to be beneficial in improving balance and cervical joint position sense in both weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing positions for the upper and lower extremities in children with cerebral palsy. However, the simultaneous application of WBVT in weight-bearing positions for both upper and lower extremities showed the most significant improvements in improving both balance and cervical joint position sense, indicating the most efficacious position of this treatment approach in children with cerebral palsy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cerebral palsy is a neurodevelopmental condition that results in impaired movement and posture, often accompanied by disturbances in balance and functional abilities. Recent advances in neurorehabilitation, including whole-body vibration therapy (WBVT), functional electrical stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation, show promise in enhancing traditional interventions and fostering neuroplasticity. However, the efficacy of their conjunct effects remains largely uncharted territory and warrants further exploration. The objective of the study was to compare the conjunct effects of functional electrical stimulation (FES) and WBVT with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and WBVT on lower extremity range of motion (ROM), dynamic balance, functional mobility, isometric muscle strength and hand grip strength in children with spastic cerebral palsy. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was carried out on 42 children of both genders with spastic cerebral palsy, aged 5-15 years. The children were divided at random into three groups (14 in each group). In Group A, there were three (21.42%) males and 11 (78.57%) females, in Group B, eight (57.14%) were males and six (42.85%) were females, and in Group C, six (42.85%) children were males and eight (57.14%) were females. Group A received WBVT only, Group B received WBVT and FES, and Group C received WBVT and tDCS. The intervention was applied four times a week for four consecutive weeks. The data was collected two times before and immediately after four weeks of intervention. Lower extremity ROM was measured by a goniometer, functional mobility or dynamic balance was measured by a Time Up and Go test, isometric muscle strength was measured by a digital force gauge, and hand grip strength was assessed by a digital hand-held dynamometer. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0 (Released 2020; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States) was utilized for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the children in groups A, B, and C was 12.21±2.11 years, 11.71±2.01, and 11.07±2.01 years respectively. Intergroup analysis revealed a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in the lower extremity range of motion, and functional mobility. Hand grip strength and isometric muscle strength between three groups. Post hoc analysis revealed that WBVT with transcranial direct current stimulation combined showed the most improvement. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that positive effects were seen in all three groups but tDCS with WBVT was found to be most effective in improving lower extremity ROM, functional mobility or dynamic balance, isometric muscle strength, and hand grip strength in children with spastic CP. The differences between the groups were statistically significant. The effect size was substantial enough to surpass established clinical benchmarks, indicating that the observed improvements are likely to have meaningful and beneficial impacts on patient outcomes."

This study aimed to assess the impact of WBV exercise on the functional capacity, muscle strength, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in severe COPD patients. METHODS: Studies published until March 2024 were reviewed, encompassing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) without temporal or linguistic constraints, comparing WBV exercise with other interventions. The PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Airways Trials Register, and CINAHL databases were queried. The Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials 2.0A was employed for quality assessment. RESULTS: Among 351 screened studies, 7 met the criteria, totaling 356 participants (WBV group, n = 182; control group, n = 174). Meta-analysis revealed a significant mean difference of 41.36 m [95%CI (13.28-69.44); p = .004] in the 6-minute walk test distance favoring the WBV group for functional capacity. Lower limb muscle strength improved in 57.14% of included studies. HRQoL meta-analysis demonstrated a 1.13-point difference [95%CI -1.24-3.51; p = .35] favoring WBV, although group differences were not significant. A mean difference of 2.31 points favored the control group in health condition [95%CI (-1.32-5.94); p = .021]. CONCLUSION: WBV exercise is recognized as a promising therapeutic modality for severe COPD patients, notably enhancing functional capacity. Although heterogeneous study protocols weaken the evidence for clinically relevant outcomes, improvements in lower limb muscle strength and HRQoL were also observed, differences between groups were not significant.",

      "abstract": "Background and objective Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions affecting children; it is characterized by poor motor control, restricted range of motion (ROM), and poor balance. While whole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) has been used to treat these symptoms, its efficacy in different configurations remains unexplored. Hence, this study aimed to determine and compare the effects of WBVT applied to either the upper extremities, lower extremities, or both upper and lower extremities in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing positions on ROM (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankle joints), balance, and function in children with spastic hemiplegic CP. Methods This randomized clinical trial involved 60 hemiplegic spastic CP children aged 5-15 years. After randomization, all the participants were divided into six groups of equal size based on the WBVT application for upper extremities, lower extremities, or both in weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing positions. The therapy was applied three times per week for four consecutive weeks. The outcome measures were ROM, hand grip strength, balance quantification score using My Fitness Trainer (MFT) 2.0, and timed up and go (TUG) scores. Results While all the groups were homogenous before treatment, after treatment, it was observed that all the ranges improved significantly in all groups. The same was observed for hand grip strength, balance score, and TUG test scores (p<0.05). The post-hoc analysis revealed that the weight-bearing position for the upper and lower extremities combined showed the highest level of improvement. Conclusions Based on our findings, WBVT in weight-bearing positions produces more significant results than in non-weight-bearing positions. We also observed that when WBVT is applied to the upper extremities, it can improve the function of the lower extremities and vice versa."

The protocols for WBV are still not standardized. The difficulty in comparing the data confuses the real efficacy of this instrument. Consequently, the objective of this umbrella review is to analyze the protocols previously adopted and eventually to propose a standard operating procedure for WBV training. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on WBV were searched on the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus until 18 March 2024. A quality assessment of the studies included has been performed. A total of 20 studies were included in this umbrella review and frequency, magnitude, and amplitude intensity data were recorded. Detailed information about the protocols (static or dynamic exercises, barefoot or with shoes, intensity duration, weekly frequency, and vibration characteristics) was also collected. WBV presents widely different protocols. Consequently, a standard operating procedure has not been proposed for WBV training. A hypothesis of intervention was instead written in which parameters for frequency, amplitude, acceleration, and training mode were proposed."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most ubiquitous form of urinary incontinence in women. The therapeutic management of patients with SUI is challenging. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of whole body vibration training (WBVT) for SUI. METHODS: Thirty-five female rats were randomly divided into a sham group (Sham group, n=5), SUI + WBVT group (n=15) and SUI + whole body rest group (SUI + WBR group, n=15). The SUI + WBVT group was trained as follows: frequency 30 Hz, amplitude four mm, one min/repeat, four min rest, repeated 10 times, five days/week. After the intervention, five rats were taken on the 7th, 14th and 21st day to observe the urodynamic changes, levator ani muscle and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) morphology, and to observe the expression of neurotrophic factor-3/tyrosine protein kinase C (NT-3/TrkC) by Western blot. RESULTS: The urodynamic results showed that the difference in bladder leak point pressure/abdominal leak point pressure (BLPP/ALPP) between the Sham group and the SUI + WBR group was statistically significant (P<0.001) on 7th day, indicating successful modeling. The BLPP/ALPP of the SUI + WBVT group and the SUI + WBR group improved on 7th, 14th, and 21st day, and the BLPP/ALPP of SUI + WBVT group was higher than the SUI + WBR group. Compared with the Sham group, pathological changes appeared in the muscle shuttles in the SUI + WBVT group and SUI + WBR group. Western blot showed a gradual up-regulation of NT-3/TrkC. CONCLUSIONS: WBVT can be used to treat SUI by affecting the expression of NT-3/TrkC, improving the structural morphology of the proprioceptors, and restoring the urinary control function. This study provides evidence for the clinical practice of WBVT. Future studies could further refine the behavioral and electrophysiological aspects of the assessment."

This meta-analysis evaluated WBV effects against other exercises, placebo, or no intervention in type-2 diabetes. Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched through June 2023. Randomized controlled trials reported the effect of WBV on glucose (hemoglobin A1C and fasting blood glucose), and lipid profiles (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high, and low-density lipoprotein) were included. Two researchers independently extracted the characteristics of the studies, participants, WBV intervention and comparisons, and the outcomes from the included articles. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale assessed trial quality. In this review, all articles had no high risk of bias according to the PEDro scale, with studies achieving optimal, excellent, and good scores. Network meta-analysis revealed that WBV was effective for reducing hemoglobin A1C when compared with conventional (mean difference: - 1.58%, 95%CrI: - 2.51, - 0.47) and resistance exercise (mean difference: - 1.32%, 95%CrI: - 1.96, - 0.33). WBV had also a desirable but insignificant effect on hemoglobin A1C compared to stretching and balance exercises, placebo, and no intervention. The current pairwise meta-analysis did not show that WBV favors fasting blood glucose and lipids. WBV may have potential advantages for glycemic control in type-2 diabetes. However, uncertainties in the findings remain due to the limited number of studies and their heterogeneity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Opioid use disorder (OUD)-associated overdose deaths have reached epidemic proportions worldwide. An important driving force for relapse is anxiety associated with opioid withdrawal. We hypothesized that our new technology, termed heterodyned whole-body vibration (HWBV) would ameliorate anxiety associated with OUD. METHODS: Using a randomized, placebo (sham)-controlled, double-blind study design in an NIH-sponsored Phase 1 trial, we evaluated 60 male and 26 female participants diagnosed with OUD and undergoing treatment at pain and rehabilitation clinics. We utilized the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and a daily visual analog scale anxiety rating (1-10) to evaluate anxiety. Subjects were treated for 10 min 5X/week for 4 weeks with either sham vibration (no interferential beat or harmonics) or HWBV (beats and harmonics). The participants also completed a neuropsychological test battery at intake and discharge. RESULTS: In OUD subjects with moderate anxiety, there was a significant improvement in daily anxiety scores in the HWBV group compared to the sham treatment group (p=3.41 × 10-7). HAM-A scores in OUD participants at intake showed moderate levels of anxiety in OUD participants (HWBV group: 15.9 ± 1.6; Sham group: 17.8 ± 1.6) and progressively improved in both groups at discharge, but improvement was greater in the HWBV group (p=1.37 × 10-3). Furthermore, three indices of neuropsychological testing (mental rotations, spatial planning, and response inhibition) were significantly improved by HWBV treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support HWBV as a novel, non-invasive, non-pharmacological treatment for anxiety associated with OUD."

      "abstract": "This cross-over study aimed to explore effects of acute whole-body vibration (WBV) at frequencies of 5-35 Hz on heart rate variability and brain excitability. Thirteen healthy physically active college students randomly completed eight interventions under the following conditions: static upright standing without vibration (CON), static squat exercise (knee flexion 150°) on the vibration platform (SSE), and static squat exercise (knee flexion 150°) combined with WBV at vibration frequency of 5, 9, 13, 20, 25, and 35 Hz. Five bouts × 30 s with a 30-s rest interval were performed for all interventions. The brain's direct current potentials (DCPs), frequency domain variables (FDV) including normalized low frequency power (nLF), normalized high frequency power (nHF) and the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF), along with the mean heart rate (MHR) were collected and calculated before and after the WBV intervention. Results suggested that WBV frequency at 5 Hz had a substantial effect on decreasing DCPs [-2.13 μV, t(84) = -3.82, p < 0.05, g = -1.03, large] and nLF [-13%, t(84) = -2.31, p = 0.04, g = -0.62, medium]. By contrast, 20-35 Hz of acute WBV intervention considerably improved DCPs [7.58 μV, t(84) = 4.31, p < 0.05, g = 1.16, large], nLF [17%, t(84) = 2.92, p < 0.05, g = 0.79, large] and the LF/HF [0.51, t(84) = 2.86, p < 0.05, g = 0.77, large]. A strong (r = 0.7, p < 0.01) correlation between DCPs and nLF was found at 5 Hz. In summary, acute WBV at 20-35 Hz principally activated the sympathetic nervous system and increased brain excitability, while 5-Hz WBV activated the parasympathetic nervous system and reduced brain excitability. The frequency spectrum of WBV might be manipulated according to the intervention target on heart rate variability and brain excitability."

Fifteen male karate club athletes (age: 20.0 ± 3.8 years; stature: 177.3 ± 4.7 cm; body mass: 76.9 ± 11.2 kg; % body fat: 9.2 ± 4.3) performed six randomized interventions: [a] static half-squat (SHS); [b] SHS with external loads at 30% of the body weight (SHS + 30%BW); [c] WBV at frequency (f) 25 Hz, and 2 mm amplitude (A) (WBV 25/2); [d] WBV 25/2 with external loads of 30% of the body weight (WBV 25/2 + 30% BW); [e] WBV at f = 50 Hz, and A = 4 mm (WBV 50/4), and [f] WBV 50/4 with external loads of 30% of the body weight (WBV 50/4 + 30% BW). Each intervention was performed for 5 sets at 60 s/set, with a rest interval of 30 s between sets. Countermovement jump (CMJ) data were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min after each preconditioning intervention. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a non-significant main effect of intervention [F(5, 10) = 1.44, η2 = 0.42, p = 0.29)] and a significant main effect of the rest interval [F(4, 11) = 3.51, η2 = 0.56, p = 0.04)] on CMJ height. A rest interval of 4 min resulted in significantly higher CMJ values than a rest interval of 2 min (p = 0.031). In conclusion, utilizing a 4-min rest interval irrespective of the intervention schemes may have potential for enhancing jumping performance among highly trained karate athletes."

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a pathology resulting from a progressive and severe loss of muscle mass, strength, and function in the course of aging, which has deleterious consequences on quality of life. Among the most widespread studies on the issue are those focused on the effect of different types of physical exercise on patients with sarcopenia. This randomized controlled study aimed to compare the effects of a whole-body vibration exercise (WBV) session on the inflammatory parameters of non-sarcopenic (NSG, n=22) and sarcopenic elderly (SG, n=22). NSG and SG participants were randomly divided into two protocols: intervention (squat with WBV) and control (squat without WBV). After a one-week washout period, participants switched protocols, so that everyone performed both protocols. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy radiological absorptiometry (DXA) and function through the six-minute walk test (6MWD) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Plasma soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFR) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and measured before and immediately after each protocol. After exercise with WBV, there was an increase in sTNFR2 levels in the NSG (P<0.01; d=-0.69 (-1.30; -0.08) and SG (P<0.01, d=-0.95 (-1.57; -0.32) groups. In conclusion, an acute session of WBV influenced sTNFr2 levels, with sarcopenic individuals showing a greater effect. This suggested that WBV had a more pronounced impact on sTNFr2 in those with loss of muscle strength and/or physical performance. Additionally, WBV is gaining recognition as an efficient strategy for those with persistent health issues.",

METHODS: this study was a randomized double-blind trial. Forty two older women aged 60-80 years were randomly allocated to IMT + WBV (G1), IMTsham + WBV (G2) or Sham groups (G3). During 12 weeks G1 received both trainings, whereas G2 received WBV alone and G3 received IMT with a low fixed load and were positioned at the vibratory platform without therapeutic effect. Participants were evaluated before and after the intervention for the following outcomes: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammatory biomarkers (IB), respiratory (RT) and quadriceps thickness (QT) and diaphragmatic mobility (DM) using muscle ultrasound, body composition (BC) using a bioelectrical impedance scale and inspiratory muscle strength (IMS). RESULTS: after the training, G1 (114.93 ± 21.29) improved IMS (p<0.005) compared with G2 (91.29 ± 23.10) and G3 (85.21 ± 27.02). There was also a significant improve on time of the DM (p<0.001) and RT (p=0.006) for G1 (8.59 ± 3.55 and 11.11 ± 12.66) compared with G2 (1.05 ± 3.09 and 1.10 ± 10.60) and G3 (0.40 ± 2.29 and -1.85 ± 7.45). BDNF, IB, QT and BC were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: IMT associated with WBV is effective to improve in increasing IMS, RT and DM in pre-frail older women. However, these interventions do not modify BDNF, IB, QT or BC in this population.",

Whole-body vibration exercise (WBVE) has emerged as a potential therapeutic modality, offering benefits across various domains, including pain reduction, improved balance, and enhanced quality of life (QoL). The aim of this present systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effects of WBVE on pain, disability, balance, proprioception, functional performance, and QoL in individuals with NSCLBP. Methods: We comprehensively searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases from October 2023 to January 2024, including RCTs with a PEDro score of ≥5 for high-quality evidence. Outcome measures included pain intensity, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score, balance, proprioception, functional performance (through a progressive iso-inertial lifting evaluation), and QoL (SF-36) in NSCLBP patients. The risk of bias was assessed using ROB-2, and the certainty of evidence for each outcome indicator was analyzed using GRADE. A meta-analysis was conducted using standardized mean differences (SMD) and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. Results: Ten randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, and nine were suitable for the meta-analysis. The qualitative synthesis revealed WBVE is effective in improving pain, disability, balance, proprioception, and functional performance and QoL. Further, the results of the quantitative review demonstrated WBVE significantly reduced pain [visual analogue scale: SMD = -0.81, 95% CI (-1.11, -0.50), I2 = 0%, p < 0.01], disability [ODI: MD = -3.78, 95% CI (-5.27, -2.29), I2 = 24%, p < 0.01]; RMDQ: MD = -1.43, 95% CI (-2.04, -0.82), I2 = 51%, p < 0.01], balance [SMD = -0.28, 95% CI (-0.52, -0.05), I2 = 0%, p = 0.02], and proprioception [SMD = -4.20, 95% CI (-7.50, -0.89), I2 = 99%, p = 0.01]. Conclusions: This review and meta-analysis indicate that WBVE significantly improves pain, disability, balance and proprioception in individuals with non-specific chronic low back pain. These findings suggest potential benefits of incorporating WBVE into the management strategies for NSCLBP."

During daily activities, for gait and dynamic balance, certain postural modifications are required. The objective was to compare the impact of trunk-oriented exercises versus whole-body vibration on abdominal muscle thickness and balance in children with DMD. METHODS: Participants in this study were 30 boys with DMD, aged 6 to 10 years old. Children were divided into two groups (A and B) randomly. Children in group (A) underwent a prescribed regimen of physical therapy along with trunk-oriented exercises, whereas group (B) received the same regimen as group (A) together with whole-body vibration three times per week for three consecutive months. Balance and the thickness of the abdominal muscles were measured using the Biodex balance system and ultrasonography, respectively, before and after therapy. RESULTS: When compared to the pre-treatment results in both groups, the post-treatment results showed a significant difference in all measured variables (p<0.05). Post-treatment values showed that all of the measured variables significantly differed in favor of group A.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Loss of functional independence is more likely in older adults who reside in an institution as a consequence of a decline in muscle mass and a loss of force production capacity. The aim of this review was to assess the effect of whole-body vibration (WBV) interventions on the strength, balance, and mobility of nursing home residents older than 80 years. METHODS: An electronic search in MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL databases was conducted. Randomized controlled trials that involved nursing home residents older than 80 years, that investigated WBV interventions compared with nonintervention, usual care, or placebo, and that measured physical function outcomes including strength, balance, gait, and mobility were included. Risk of bias was assessed by 2 reviewers using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. The standardized mean differences (SMD) between the experimental and control groups were calculated with a random-effects model for each outcome, and subgroup analysis was conducted for different outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 2864 articles were identified; of these, 14 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis revealed that WBV significantly increased the lower limb muscle strength (SMD = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.16 to 1.03), mobility (SMD = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.81), gait score (SMD = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.51), balance (SMD = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.81), and physical performance (SMD = 1.33; 95% CI = 0.33 to 2.33). CONCLUSION: WBV may be an effective intervention to improve the strength, balance, mobility, walking ability, and physical performance of older nursing home residents. IMPACT: WBV presents a safe, accessible alternative for improving health in this vulnerable population, warranting further research and integration into health care practices.",

The aim of the present study was to explore the therapeutic potential of five weeks of WBV on anxiety-like behaviors as well as learning and memory abilities in senescent thirty months old rats. Animals were exposed to 5 min vibration twice per day, five times per week during the five consecutive weeks. Pseudo WBV treated animals served as controls. After five weeks of WBV treatment, animals were tested for anxiety-like behavior by the open field test and for spatial and object memory functions by the novel and spatial object recognition tests, respectively. As a result, anxiety-like and exploratory behaviors were significantly improved in the WBV treated group compared to the pseudo WBV group. Furthermore, WBV treatment increased discrimination performance in both spatial and object memory function testing. These results indicate that WBV treatment in thirty months old rats seems to have comparable beneficial effects on age-related emotional and cognitive performance as what has been reported in younger age groups."

Additionally, potential moderators influencing WBVT outcomes were explored. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to September 2022. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials employing WBVT in patients with stroke. Two investigators independently extracted the data and calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) using random-effect models. Results: Twenty-five studies involving 991 patients were included in this meta-analysis. WBVT demonstrated significant reductions in spasticity (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI = -0.61 to -0.06, p = 0.02), improvements in motor function (SMD = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.61, p < 0.01), and enhancements in balance function (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.47, p < 0.01) in patients with stroke. However, no significant effects were observed for gait (SMD = -0.23, 95% CI = -0.50 to 0.04, p = 0.10), ADL (SMD = -0.01, 95% CI = -0.46 to 0.44, p = 0.97), or QOL (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI = -0.30 to 0.53, p = 0.59). Subgroup analyses revealed that variable frequency vibration and side-alternating vibration exhibited significant efficacy in reducing spasticity and improving motor and balance functions, while fixed frequency vibration and vertical vibration did not yield significant therapeutic benefits in these domains. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that WBVT may serve as a viable adjunct therapy for stroke patients to alleviate spasticity and enhance motor and balance functions. Variable frequency and side-alternating vibration appear to be crucial factors influencing the therapeutic effects of WBVT on these dysfunctions. Nonetheless, WBVT did not show significant effects on gait, ADL, or QOL in stroke patients. Systematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier (CRD42022384319)."

Strength training under intermittent hypoxic conditions has been shown to have therapeutic effects on individual's health. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a combined intermittent hypoxia (IH) and whole-body vibration (WBV) training program on health-related outcomes in older people. METHODS: A total of 60 adults (over the age of 65) voluntarily participated in an intervention that lasted 20 weeks (three 30-min sessions per week). The participants were divided into four experimental groups subjected to different environmental conditions (IH vs normoxia) and exercise (non-exercise vs WBV). Functional fitness, body composition, metabolic parameters, inflammatory biomarkers, and bone turnover were evaluated before and after the intervention. A multifactorial ANOVA with repeated measures was performed to explore differences within and between groups. RESULTS: The results showed that IH and WBV had a positive synergistic effect on inflammatory parameters (CRP and IL-10), bone formation biomarker (PINP), and body composition (muscle and bone mass). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a combined IH and WVB training could be a useful tool to prevent the deterioration of health-related outcomes associated with aging.

      "abstract": "Exposure to excessive whole-body vibration is linked to health issues and may result in increased rates of mortality and morbidity in infants. Newborn infants requiring specialized treatment at neonatal intensive care units often require transportation by road ambulance to specialized care centers, exposing the infants to potentially harmful vibration and noise. A standardized Neonatal Patient Transport System (NPTS) has been deployed in Ontario, Canada, that provides life saving equipment to patients and safe operation for the clinical care staff. However, there is evidence that suggests patients may experience a higher amplitude of vibration at certain frequencies when compared with the vehicle vibration. In a multi-year collaborative project, we seek to create a standardized test procedure to evaluate the levels of vibration and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Previous studies have looked at laboratory vibration testing of a transport system or transport incubator and were limited to single degree of freedom excitation, neglecting the combined effects of rotational motion. This study considers laboratory testing of a full vehicle and patient transport system on an MTS Model 320 Tire-Coupled Road Simulator. The simulation of road profiles and discrete events on a tire-coupled road simulator allows for the evaluation of the vibration levels of the transport system and the exploration of mitigation strategies in a controlled setting. The tire-coupled simulator can excite six degrees-of-freedom motion of the transport system for vibration evaluation in three orthogonal directions including the contributions of the three rotational degrees of freedom. The vibration data measured on the transport system during the tire-coupled testing are compared to corresponding road test data to assess the accuracy of the vibration environment replication. Three runs of the same drive file were conducted during the laboratory testing, allowing the identification of anomalies and evaluation of the repeatability. The tire-coupled full vehicle testing revealed a high level of accuracy in re-creating the road sections and synthesized random profiles. The simulation of high amplitude discrete events, such as speed hump traverses, were highly repeatable, yet yielded less accurate results with respect to the peak amplitudes at the patient. The resulting accelerations collected at the input to the manikin (sensor located under the mattress) matched well between the real-world and road simulator. The sensors used during testing included series 3741B uni-axial and series 356A01 tri-axial accelerometers by PCB Piezotronics. These results indicate a tire-coupled road simulator can be used to accurately evaluate vibration levels and assess the benefits of future mitigation strategies in a controlled setting with a high level of repeatability.",

We investigated whether discretizing WBV into bouts with short rest intervals was effective in enhancing osteoporotic bone repair. Ten-week-old female mice were ovariectomized and underwent drill-hole defect surgery (Day 0) on the right tibial diaphysis at 11 weeks of age. The mice underwent one of three regimens starting from Day 1 for 5 days/week: continuous WBV at 45 Hz and 0.3 g for 7.5 min/day (cWBV); 3-s bouts of WBV at 45 Hz, 0.3 g followed by 9-s rest intervals, repeated for 30 min/day (repeated bouts of whole-body vibration with short rest intervals [rWBV]); or a sham treatment. Both the cWBV and rWBV groups received a total of 20,250 vibration cycles per day. On either Day 7 or 14 posteuthanasia (n = 6/group/timepoint), the bone and angiogenic vasculature in the defect were computed tomography imaged using synchrotron light. By Day 14, the bone repair was most advanced in the rWBV group, showing a higher bone volume fraction and a more uniform mineral distribution compared with the sham group. The cWBV group exhibited an intermediate level of bone repair between the sham and rWBV groups. The rWBV group had a decrease in large-sized angiogenic vessels, while the cWBV group showed an increase in such vessels. In conclusion, osteoporotic bone repair was enhanced by WBV bouts with short rest intervals, which may potentially be attributed to the improved mechanosensitivity of osteogenic cells and alterations in angiogenic vasculature.",

The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether WBV training positively affects patients with CAI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors systematically searched four databases, including MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, for randomized and non-randomized trials evaluating the effects of WBV on individuals with CAI. The authors used Cochrane RoB2 to assess the risk of bias in randomized trials. A meta-analysis was conducted if three or more studies measured the same outcome. Effect estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Results were retrieved from seven articles encompassing 288 participants who had CAI. The reach distance of the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) was regarded as the study's main finding. The authors saw a significant training effect on certain planes of motion on dynamic balance. The findings showed that the post-intervention measurements in the WBV group compared to control groups showed improvements in the posterolateral, posteromedial, and medial directions, respectively. There were also promising results on improvements in muscle activity, strength, and proprioception sense measurements with a great diversity in the reported parameters. CONCLUSION: The authors observed a significant WBV training effect on dynamic balance over posterolateral, posteromedial, and medial reach distances. These findings suggest future studies on the effects of WBV on muscle activity, strength, and proprioception in addition to dynamic and static balance."

The methodological quality of each included study was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. RESULTS: Our search strategy yielded 5309 articles, of which 7 published randomized clinical trials (313 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Three of the 4 included studies that investigated balance reported significant improvements after WBV, of which 2 were of high methodological quality. The remaining 3 studies investigating proprioception also showed significant improvements after WBV intervention. CONCLUSION: Although some studies seem to provide promising results regarding the efficacy of WBV or WBV combined with exercise in improving balance and proprioception in patients with NSCLBP, at present, no definite conclusions can be drawn due to article heterogeneity and lack of clinical trials."

      "abstract": "Introduction: The aging process is associated with changes in body composition, including fat gain and skeletal muscle loss from middle age onward. Moreover, increased risk of functional decline and the development of chronic diseases are also related to aging. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of whole-body vibration exercise (WBVE), as a physical exercise, on body composition in people over 60 years of age. Methods: Searches were performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase. Only randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of WBVE on body composition in older individuals were considered. The methodological quality of the studies involved was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale, recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration were used to assess risk of bias, and quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. RevMan 5.4 was used to calculate standardized mean differences and confidence intervals of 95% (CIs). Results: Eight studies were included in this review with a mean methodological quality score of 7.5, which is considered high quality on the PEDro scale. The included studies suggest that more robust research with protocols and well-designed comparison groups is required to better assess changes in the body composition of older individuals through WBVE. Quantitative results were calculated, with differences in weighted means, differences in standardized means, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Conclusion: WBVE evaluated by the studies included in this review did not demonstrate improvements in body composition, and no significant effect of WBVE was found on fat mass with standardized differences (SD = -1.92; 95% CI: -4.81 to -0.98; p = 0.19), lean mass with standardized mean differences (SMD = 0.06 CI 95% [-0.21; -0.33]; p = 0.67), or skeletal muscle mass with standardized differences (SD = 0.10; CI 95% [-1.62; 1.83]; p = 0.91). Therefore, to date, there is lack of adequate evidence to state that WBVE can benefit the body composition of men and women over 60 years of age. However, further studies are required to better understand the physiological impacts of WBVE on body composition.

Whole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) has shown effectiveness in improving pain and sensorimotor function (e.g., in osteoporosis) in previous studies. However, studies had heterogeneous settings. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of WBVT on pain, function, proprioception, and postural stability in patients with subacute and chronic NLBP. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in the scientific databases PubMed, EMBASE, and PEDro (from inception until 17.05.2023). Only prospective controlled and uncontrolled studies were included. Outcome measures assessed were pain intensity, function (activities of daily living and physical function), proprioception, and postural stability. RESULTS: A total of 12 original articles (n = 821) were included in the analysis. Ten of the studies were randomized controlled trials, one study had a crossover design, and one study had a one-group pre-post study design. The studies compared WBVT vs. no intervention, WBVT vs. basic physical therapy, WBVT vs. core stabilization exercises with and without respiratory resistance, WBVT vs. lumbar extension exercises, and WBVT vs. whole body electromyostimulation training. The treatment approaches varied in terms of duration (2-18 weeks), frequency (2-3 times per week, two applications with a 2-week break), vibration frequency (5-30 Hz), type of exercises (WBVT with or without static or dynamic exercises), and vibration direction (horizontal and vertical). Significant pain reduction was observed in all 10 studies that investigated pain levels. Significant improvement in daily activity function was reported in five of the six studies that investigated daily function, while improvement in physical function was observed in all four studies that investigated physical function. Improvement in proprioception was reported in all three studies that investigated proprioception, and significant improvement in postural stability was observed in four out of six studies that investigated postural stability. No adverse events or side effects related to WBVT were reported. CONCLUSION: The majority of the included studies demonstrated significant pain reduction, improvement in physical and daily functioning, and enhanced proprioception. Improvement in postural stability was less consistent. WBVT appears to be a safe and effective treatment modality for subacute and chronic NLBP when used within a multimodal approach. Future research should focus on standardized settings including assessment methods, treatment regimens, frequencies, and intensities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute physiological and biomechanical alterations have been reported following whole-body vibration (WBV). Stiffening of muscles has only been anecdotally reported in response to WBV. Accordingly, this study investigated active plantar flexor muscle stiffness in response to a single WBV bout at four mechanical vibration frequencies. METHODS: Thirteen healthy adults (37.1 ± 14.4 years old) randomly received WBV in 4 different frequencies (6, 12, 24, and 0 Hz control) for 5 min. Shear wave speed (SWS) in longitudinal and transverse projections, architecture, and electric muscle activity were recorded in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus (SOL) muscle during graded plantar flexor contraction. Subjective rating of perceived muscle stiffness was assessed via Likert-scale. RESULTS: SWS of the MG at rest was enhanced in response to 5 min of 24 Hz WBV (p = 0.025), while a small reduction in SOL SWS was found during contraction (p = 0.005) in the longitudinal view. Subjective stiffness rating was increased following 12 Hz intervention. After 24 Hz WBV, pennation angle for MG was decreased (p = 0.011) during contraction. As a secondary finding, plantar flexor strength was significantly increased with each visit, which, however, did not affect the study's main outcome because of balanced sequence allocation. CONCLUSION: SWS effects were solely limited to 24 Hz mechanical vibration and in the longitudinal projection. The observed effects are compatible with an interpretation by post-activation potentiation, warm-up, and force-distribution within the triceps surae muscles following 5 min WBV. The outcome may suggest SWS as a useful tool for assessing acute changes in muscle stiffness."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, whole-body vibration (WBV) has become increasingly popular as an additional therapy in the intervention of patients with cerebral palsy (CP). However, the impact of WBV remains a subject of debate. Consequently, a systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken to evaluate the effects of WBV on the musculoskeletal system in children with CP. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were sought in the most frequent databases. The intervention studied was WBV combined with conventional physiotherapy (PT) compared with conventional PT as the control; the main outcomes were changes in the musculoskeletal system. Weighted mean differences with 95%CIs were calculated. A random-effects model was applied, and the publication bias was checked using funnel plots. On the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 articles, including 414 patients, were considered in the final analysis. The improvement in walking performance (speed and step length) was statistically significant (p < 0.05), and although there were no significant differences in the further outcomes, a clear positive tendency was visible in the case of improved muscle strength, decreased spasticity, enhanced gross motor functions, and overall stability. Based on the findings, a clear assessment of the usefulness of this intervention cannot be made; nonetheless, due to the promising results, it would be worthwhile to conduct additional RCTs to enhance the available evidence in this field. Due to the wide range of vibration configurations, including varying durations and intensities, it is suggested to establish guidelines and a strategy for the incorporation of this additional treatment."

Its management is linked to medications, changes in lifestyle, and physical exercise, with the whole-body vibration exercises (WBV) being a promising therapeutic resource. This study aims to investigate the effects of WBV in isolation or associated with other types of exercises in the management of CVDs. METHODS: A systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines and registered on the PROSPERO platform was carried out. The search took place in the databases PubMed, Cochrane, PEDro, Lilacs, and Science Direct, from the beginning of the databases until January 2021. Descriptors related to WBV and CVD were used. The selected studies were assessed for quality, risk of bias, and level of evidence. RESULTS: In all, 84 studies were identified, and of these, three were included. The intervention protocols used were analyzed, in addition to the effects of WBV on hemodynamic, cardiovascular, vascular/arterial, and muscle parameters. CONCLUSION: The use of different WBV protocols, in isolation, in the improvement of the parameters mentioned above in individuals with CVD is plausible, with significant responses acutely or chronically and can be considered as a safe and effective training resource.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most important clinical problem in myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is trigger points (TrPs). The aim of the present study was to investigate the comparison of immediate effect of deep transverse friction massage (DTFM), high-power pain threshold ultrasound (HPPTUS), and whole body vibration (WBV) on treatment of active myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: sixty six men with active TrPs of upper trapezius muscle were randomly divided into three equal groups: DTFM, HPPT US, and WBV. Pain intensity based on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), pressure pain threshold (PPT) and active contralateral lateral flexion range of motion (CLF ROM) of the neck were evaluated before and immediately after the interventions. RESULTS: The VAS, PPT and the active CLF ROM were substantially improved after intervention in all groups (P < 0.01). When the three groups were compared regarding VAS, participants in the WBV group reported significantly more reduction in pain (P < 0.01). On comparing the interventions, there were no significant differences in PPT values (P > 0.05). The CLF ROM value in HPPTUS and WBV groups have significant increase in comparison to the DTFM group. CONCLUSION: All three interventions can improve neck pain, PPT and ROM in participants with active TrPs in upper trapezius muscle, but due to the fact that the DTFM has more pressure on therapist fingers, and the HPPTUS technique requires proper interaction with the participants, WBV can be used as one of the effective intervention on active MTrPs of upper trapezius.

      "abstract": "Background: Steroid-induced Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head (SIONFH) is a skeletal disease with a high incidence and a poor prognosis. Whole body vibration therapy (WBVT), a new type of physical training, is known to promote bone formation. However, it remains unclear whether WBVT has a therapeutic effect on SIONFH. Materials and methods: Thirty adult male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were selected and randomly assigned to three experimental groups: the control group, the model group, and the mechanical vibration group, respectively. SIONFH induction was achieved through the combined administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and methylprednisolone sodium succinate for injection (MPS). The femoral head samples underwent hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to visualize tissue structures. Structural parameters of the region of interest (ROI) were compared using Micro-CT analysis. Immunohistochemistry was employed to assess the expression levels of Piezo1, BMP2, RUNX2, HIF-1, VEGF, CD31, while immunofluorescence was used to examine CD31 and Emcn expression levels. Results: The H&E staining results revealed a notable improvement in the ratio of empty lacuna in various groups following WBVT intervention. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression levels of Piezo1, BMP2, RUNX2, HIF-1, VEGF, and CD31 in the WBVT group exhibited significant differences when compared to the Model group (p < 0.05). Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences in CD31 and Emcn expression levels between the WBVT group and the Model group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: WBVT upregulates Piezo1 to promote osteogenic differentiation, potentially by enhancing the HIF-1α/VEGF axis and regulating H-vessel angiogenesis through the activation of the Piezo1 ion channel. This mechanism may lead to improved blood flow supply and enhanced osteogenic differentiation within the femoral head."

Whole body vibration (WBV) can affect energy expenditure during single session of WBV, but the effects of repeated WBV on resting metabolic rate have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a series of WBV would increase resting metabolism in young men. Thirty-two healthy men aged of 21-23 were recruited and randomly assigned to two 16-member groups: a group participating in the WBV intervention and a group without the intervention. The intervention lasted 2 weeks and WBV was performed 5 times a week. Diet, physical activity, body composition and resting metabolic rate were analyzed in the participants. In WBV group significantly increased resting oxygen uptake (p = 0.049) and consequently RMR (p = 0.035) after the intervention. Similar changes were not observed in the control group. This indicates that applied type of vibration in this study can be an addition to obesity therapy, in which, WBV can, among other beneficial metabolic effects, increase RMR and thus total energy expenditure.",

Whole-body vibration demonstrated effectiveness in improving muscle power and bone mineral density in various musculoskeletal populations. This systematic review of randomized controlled trials aims to assess evidence for the effectiveness of using whole-body vibration on postburn survivors with at least 1% total body surface area on sensory and motor outcomes. A systematic search was conducted across six databases, which are, PubMed, Cochrane, PEDro, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, from inception till March 2022. Retrieved studies were screened by title and abstract and full-text in two stages using Rayyan web-based. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool ROB 2.0. Six randomized controlled trials with 203 participants were included. Five of the included studies demonstrated an overall high risk of bias. Compared to conventional physiotherapy programs, whole-body vibration demonstrated improvement in functional mobility and balance using timed up and go and Biodex balance assessment, respectively. However, there were no differences between whole-body vibration and conventional physiotherapy program alone in bone mineral density and muscle power. Although the current evidence of whole-body vibration is limited, whole-body vibration combined with traditional physical therapy programs may improve functional mobility and balance in postburn survivors compared to physical therapy programs alone.",

In this study, we employ a similar paradigm to assess the efficacy of WBV as a preventative measure of neuronal and behavioral effects of morphine withdrawal in a Wistar rat model. We demonstrate that concurrent administration of WBV at 80 Hz with morphine over a 5-day period significantly reduced adaptations in VTA GABA neuronal activity and NAc DA release and modulated expression of δ-opioid receptors (DORs) on NAc cholinergic interneurons (CINs) during withdrawal. We also observed a reduction in behavior typically associated with opioid withdrawal.

J Strength Cond Res 37(10): 2071-2075, 2023-The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of medicine ball wall throws performed with whole-body vibration on bat swing performance in 13 highly trained collegiate baseball players. The experimental session involved the athletes' usual warm-up followed by baseline bat swings. The baseline bat swings were followed by 3 sets of 5 medicine ball wall throws while standing on a whole-body vibration platform set at 40 Hz and with 30 seconds rest between sets. Subjects then rested passively for 5 minutes before taking post-test bat swings. Performance was evaluated with bat speed (m·second-1), time to contact (secs), rotational acceleration (G's), and exit velocity (m·second-1). Paired t tests were used to compare baseline and post-test values (p ≤ 0.05). Effect size (d) statistics were also calculated to determine the magnitude of treatment effects. It was found that bat speed (p = 0.02; d = 0.22) and exit velocity (p = 0.03; d = 0.48) were significantly faster versus baseline, whereas rotational acceleration (p = 0.10; d = 0.23) and time to contact (p = 0.44; d = -0.12) were not significantly different from baseline, respectively. These results suggest that the addition of medicine ball wall throws with whole-body vibration can significantly increase key parameters of bat swing performance. Practitioners and coaches may consider including these combined exercise stimuli as part of workouts or during games for potentially greater success at the plate.",

Methods: A total of 86 healthy older people was randomly divided into WBVT group (WG, n = 21), KT group (KG, n = 22), combined intervention group (CIG, n = 20) and control group (CG, n = 23). WG and CIG subjects underwent WBVT, and KG and CIG subjects underwent 150 mmHg and lower limb joint and local compression intervention for 16 weeks (three times per week, about 15 min/time). The peak torque (PT) and endurance ratio (ER) of joint flexion or extension were tested for all subjects. Results: 1) Results at 16 weeks were compared with the baseline data. The knee extension and ankle flexion PT (60°/s) in CIG increased by 14.3% and 15.3%, respectively (p < 0.05). The knee extension PT (180°/s) increased by 16.9, 18.4% and 33.3% in WG, KG and CIG (p < 0.05), respectively, and the ankle extension PT (180°/s) in CIG increased by 31.1% (p < 0.05). The hip, knee extension and ankle flexion ER increased by 10.0, 10.9% and 5.7% in CIG (p < 0.05), respectively. 2) Results were compared among groups at 16 weeks. The relative changes were significantly lower in WG, KG and CG compared to CIG in the knee extension and ankle flexion PT (60°/s) (p < 0.05). The relative changes were significantly greater in WG, KG and CIG compared to CG in the knee extension PT (180°/s) (p < 0.05). The relative changes were significantly lower in WG, KG and CG compared to CIG in the ankle extension PT (180°/s) (p < 0.05). The relative changes were significantly lower in WG, KG and CG compared to CIG in the hip extension ER (p < 0.05). The relative changes were significantly lower in CG compared to CIG in the knee extension ER (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Sixteen-week WBVT and KT increased the knee extensor strength in older women. Compared with a single intervention, the combined intervention had better improvements in the knee extensor and ankle flexor and extensor strength and hip extension muscle endurance. Appears to be some additional benefit from combined intervention above those derived from single-interventions."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search was performed on the databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, SCI-hub, ScienceDirect, Embase, IEEE, Medline, Wiley, ClinicaIKey, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP database, Chinese Medical Association, and CBM Database from inception to May 2022 to collect randomized controlled studies on whole-body vibration training for patients with Parkinson's disease. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data, and evaluated the quality of the literature, then used ReviewManager 5.4 software for quantitative statistical analysis, including heterogeneity test, sensitivity analysis, risk of bias assessment, combined outcome index effect size and effect size inspection. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 346 patients, 174 patients in the control group and 172 patients in the observation group. Meta-analysis results showed that, compared with conventional physical therapy or drug therapy alone, whole-body vibration reduced the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRSIII) score and significantly improved the motor function of patients with Parkinson's disease [MD=-2.39, 95% CI (-4.41, -0.37), Z=2.14 (p=0.23)]. Moreover, whole-body vibration significantly improved the walking stability of Parkinson's patients [MD=-1.96, 95% CI (-2.71-1.21), Z=1.17 (p=0.03)]. However, its improvement in balance ability [MD=-0.06, 95% CI (-0.77, 0.65), Z=1.07 (p=0.19)] and daily living ability [MD=0.03, 95% CI (-1.68, 0.74), Z=0.24 (p=0.87)] of patients, it was not t statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional therapy, WBV has certain advantages in improving the balance function and gait performance of PD patients, but the effect on balance ability and daily living ability is not significant. Thus, more high-quality research is required for further verification.",

      "abstract": "MATERIALS & METHODS: Eleven healthy adults participated in four 1-hour sessions of ecologically valid WBV exposure followed by one of four 5-minute activities: sitting, walking, 2 min of gaze stabilization exercise (GSE) coupled with 3 min of trunk mobility exercise (GSE + MOBIL), or 2 min of GSE coupled with a 3-minute walk (GSE + WALK). Baseline and post-activity measurements (rating of perceived discomfort, balance and postural sway measurements, 5-minute psychomotor vigilance task test) were submitted to a paired t-test to determine the effect of WBV exposure and activities on physical, cognitive, and sensorimotor systems and to a repeated measures ANOVA to determine any differences across activities. RESULTS: We observed degradation of the slowest 10% reaction speed outcomes between baseline and post-activity after walking (7.3%, p < 0.05) and sitting (8.6%, p < 0.05) but not after GSE + MOBIL or GSE + WALK activities. Slowest 10% reaction speed after GSE + MOBIL activity was faster than all other activities. The rating of perceived discomfort was higher after SIT and WALK activities. There were no notable differences in balance outcomes. CONCLUSION: When compared to sitting for 5 min, an activity including GSE and an active component, such as walking or trunk mobility exercises, resulted in maintenance of reaction time after WBV exposure. If confirmed in occupational environments, GSE may provide a simple, rapid, effective, and inexpensive means to protect against decrements in reaction time after WBV exposure.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a form of musculoskeletal disease that can occur after a lateral ankle sprain, and it is characterized by pain, recurrent ankle sprains, a feeling of \"giving way\" at the ankle joint, and sensorimotor deficits. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that plastic changes in the brain after the initial injury play an important role in CAI. As one modality to treat CAI, whole-body vibration (WBV) has been found to be beneficial for treating the sensorimotor deficits accompanying CAI, but whether these benefits are associated with brain plasticity remains unknown. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of WBV on sensorimotor deficits and determine its correlation with plastic changes in the brain. METHODS: The present study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 participants with CAI recruited from the university and local communities will be divided into 4 groups: whole-body vibration and balance training (WBVBT), balance training (BT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and control group. Participants will be given the WBV intervention (25-38 Hz, 1.3-2 mm, 3-time per week, 6-week) supervised by a professional therapist. Primary outcome measures are sensorimotor function including strength, balance, proprioception and functional performance. Brain plasticity will be evaluated by corticomotor excitability, inhibition, and representation of muscles, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Activation of brain areas will be assessed through functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures are self-reported functional outcomes involving the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. All tests will be conducted before and after the WBV intervention, and at 2-week follow-up. Per‑protocol and intention-to-treat analysis will be applied if any participants withdraw. DISCUSSION: This is the first trial to investigate the role of brain plasticity in sensorimotor changes brought by WBV for individuals with CAI. As plastic changes in the brain have been an increasingly important aspect in CAI, the results of the current study can provide insight into the treatment of CAI from the perspective of brain plasticity.

      "abstract": "Whole Body Vibration has been found to induce physiological changes in human subjects, improving their neuromuscular, respiratory and cardiovascular functions. Evidence from animal research prove that whole-body vibration appears to induce changes in molecular and cellular levels to alter cognitive functions in mice. There is evolving evidence for a potential value of whole body vibration in improving cognition and preventing the development of age-related cognitive disorders in humans. However, literature on the biological consequences of whole-body vibration on the human brain is scanty. If so, gathering the available evidences would help decide the possibility of designing appropriate whole-body vibration protocols to extend its application to induce neurocognitive enhancement and optimize its effects. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature was performed, consulting the ProQuest, MEDLINE and Scopus bibliographic databases, to summarize the available scientific evidence on the effects of whole-body vibration on cognitive functions in adults. Results of the review suggest that whole-body vibration therapy enhances a wide spectrum of cognitive functions in adults although there isn't enough evidence available yet to be able to design a standardized protocol to achieve optimum cognitive enhancement."

METHODS: A total of 34 children with spastic hemiparetic CP (boys and girls) participated in this 2-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial. The inclusion criteria were spasticity ranging from 1 to 1+, gross level skills (I and II), at least 1 meter tall, standing alone, and walking forward and backward. They were randomly allocated to the control group (traditional physiotherapy) and study group and were treated by the same physiotherapy program combined with WBV training (3 times per week for 2 successive months). Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, walking performance, and postural control were evaluated before and after intervention by a blinded assessor. RESULTS: The post-intervention values of the hamstring and quadriceps muscle force, gross motor function, and stability indices of the 2 groups were higher than the pre-values (P < .05). In addition, the post-values of the study group were higher than those of the control group (P < .05). Regarding the H:Q ratio, there was no significant difference between pre-values or the post-values of both groups (P = .948 and P = .397, respectively). There were no significant differences between the pre- and post-values of each group (P = .500 and P = .195, respectively). CONCLUSION: Eight weeks of WBV training combined with traditional physiotherapy was more effective than traditional physiotherapy alone in improving walking ability and postural control. Furthermore, the combined intervention strengthened the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, with no change in the H:Q ratio in children with hemiparetic CP.",

Methods: Thirty seven elderly patients with stable COPD were randomly divided into control group (group C, n=12, age: 64.6±3.8 years), conventional PR group (PR group, n=12, age: 66.1±4.9 years), and whole body vibration combined PR group (WP group, n=13, age: 65.5±3.3 years). Before intervention, X-ray and computerized tomography bone scan, bone metabolic markers, pulmonary function, cardiopulmonary exercise, 6-minute walking and isokinetic muscle strength were performed, and then intervened for 36 weeks, three times/week, among which group C subjects were given routine treatment, PR group added aerobic running and static weight resistance on the basis of routine treatment, and WP group added WBV on the basis of PR group intervention. After the intervention, the same indicators were detected. Results: Compared with before the intervention, the pulmonary function indexes of each group were significantly improved after the intervention (P＜0.05), and the bone mineral density and bone microstructure indexes of the patients in the WP group were also significantly improved (P＜0.05). Compared with group C and group PR, the bone mineral density, bone microstructure, parathyroid hormone (PTH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), osteocalcin (OCN) and other bone metabolism indexes, knee flexion, peak extension torque, fatigue index and muscle strength of patients in WP group were significantly improved (P＜0.05). Conclusion: Adding WBV to the conventional PR regimen can improve the bone strength, lung function and exercise capacity of elderly patients with COPD complicated with OP, and may be able to make up for the deficiency of the current conventional PR regimen for insufficient muscle and bone stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Microglial cells play an important role in neuroinflammation and secondary damages after spinal cord injury (SCI). Progressive microglia/macrophage inflammation along the entire spinal axis follows SCI, and various factors may determine the microglial activation profile. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) is known to control the survival of neurons, the function of synapses, and the release of neurotransmitters, while also stimulating axon plasticity and growth. We examined the effects of whole-body vibration (WBV) and forms of assisted locomotor therapy, such as passive flexion-extension (PFE) therapy, at the neuronal level after SCI, with a focus on changes in NT-3 expression and on microglia/macrophage reaction, as they play a major role in the reconstitution of CNS integrity after injury and they may critically account for the observed structural and functional benefits of physical therapy. More specifically, the WBV therapy resulted in the best overall functional recovery when initiated at day 14, while inducing a decrease in Iba1 and the highest increase in NT-3. Therefore, the WBV therapy at the 14th day appeared to be superior to the PFE therapy in terms of recovery. Functional deficits and subsequent rehabilitation depend heavily upon the inflammatory processes occurring caudally to the injury site; thus, we propose that increased expression of NT-3, especially in the dorsal horn, could potentially be the mediator of this favorable outcome."

DATA SOURCES: Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE databases were searched for papers published in English, from January 1, 2000, to May 30, 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials of WBVT in older adults (mean age, 65 years or older) published in English. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently assessed articles according to the evaluation criteria. Differences between investigator assessments were resolved by consulting a third investigator before reassessment. DATA SYNTHESIS: Systematic review of 18 randomized controlled studies found that WBVT produced significant improvements in lower limb muscle strength and physical performance among older adults. We used the Cochrane Collaboration method to assess risk of bias and RevMan version 5.4a to extract means and calculate SDs. WBVT significantly improved knee strength (standard mean difference [SMD]=0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.38, 1.07], P<.0001, I2=58%) and explosive power (SMD=0.47, 95% CI [0.10, 0.83], P=.01, I2=0%) among older adults. Significant improvements in each physical performance were observed in the sit-to-stand test (SMD=0.57, 95% CI [0.30, 0.84], P<.0001, I2=35%), the subgroup of studies that evaluated balance with timed Up and Go test, SMD was 0.53 (95% CI [0.19, 0.88], P=.002, I2=56%) and the Tinetti total score, SMD was 0.72 (95% CI [0.04, 1.41], P=.04, I2=81%), walking speed (SMD=0.46, 95% CI [0.14, 0.77], P=.005, I2=49%), and walking endurance (SMD=0.43, 95% CI [0.02, 0.85], P=.04, I2=24%). CONCLUSIONS: WBVT may be an effective intervention to improve lower limb muscle strength and physical performance in older adults. Tinetti total score remains controversial and warrants assessment in future high-quality randomized controlled trials.",

It is known that within six months after a fall, two thirds of fallers will fall again. Therefore, therapeutic procedures to improve balance that are simple and can be performed in a short time are needed. Stochastic resonance whole-body vibration (SR-WBV) may be such a procedure. METHOD: An electronic search to assess the effectiveness of SR-WBV on balance in the elderly was conducted using databases that included CINAHL Cochrane, PEDro, and PubMed. Included studies were assessed using the Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Nine studies showing moderate methodological quality were included. Treatment parameters were heterogeneous. Vibration frequency ranged from 1 to 12 Hz. Six studies found statistically significant improvements of balance from baseline to post measurement after SR-WBV interventions. One article found clinical relevance of the improvement in total time of the \"Expanded Time to Get Up and Go Test\". DISCUSSION: Physiological adaptations after balance training are specific and may explain some of the observed heterogeneity. Two out of nine studies assessed reactive balance and both indicated statistically significant improvements after SR-WBV. Therefore, SR-WBV represents a reactive balance training."

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether whole body vibration (WBV) training has an effect on functional capacity and respiratory functions in patients with stroke. METHODS: In the randomized-controlled study, 28 participants were randomized into two groups: one receiving Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT; n = 13) and one receiving both NDT and WBV (NDT + WBV; n = 15). The primary outcome measures were 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) and Pulmonary Function Test which evaluate functional and respiratory capacity. Secondary outcome included the chest circumference measurement to evaluate the thoracic expansion ability. RESULTS: Both groups showed positive significant changes in walking distance and maximum oxygen consumption volume (VO2max), inspiratory capacity, vital capacity and chest circumference measurement scores (p < 0.05). While the NDT +WBV group showed a significantly greater increase in walking distance and VO2max levels than the NDT group (p < 0.05), there were no significant group differences in respiratory function flow and volume parameters, and chest circumference measurement. CONCLUSION: The addition of WBV training to the treatment program has some incremental benefits on increasing functional capacity and thoracic expansion, and rehabilitating respiratory dysfunction.",

Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 14.0 software after data extraction. Results: Twenty-five RCTs with a total of 1267 subjects were finally included. The results of the pairwise comparison of the Network Meta-analysis showed that the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT) values of Low-frequency whole-body vibration training (LF-WBVT) was lower than the placebo and traditional rehabilitation groups, and the difference was statistically significant [WMD = -1.37, 95% CI (-2.53, -0.20)] [WMD = -1.84, 95% CI(-3.17,-0.51)]. The Five-repetition Sit-to-Stand Test (5STS) values of LF-WBVT, Medium-frequency whole-body vibration training (MF-WBVT), and High-frequency whole-body vibration training (HF-WBVT) were lower than the placebo and traditional rehabilitation groups, but none of them were statistically significant. In addition, the TUGT and 5STS values of HF-WBVT had a tendency to be lower than those of LF-WBVT and MF-WBVT, but neither of them was statistically different. The cumulative probability ranking results of both TUGT and 5STS showed that HF-WBVT was the best protocol. Conclusion: Current evidence shows that HF-WBVT may be the best protocol for improving balance in older adults. Due to the study's limitations, the conclusion obtained in this study still needs to be further confirmed by more high-quality studies.

Method: Sixteen male sprinters randomly performed BFRT, WBV, or BFRT + WBV interventions with 72 h intervals. Electromyography (EMG) signals were collected before and during interventions. Fingertip blood was taken before, immediately after, and 15 min after the intervention. 20 m sprint was performed before and 3 min after the intervention. Results: 1) 0-10m and 0-20 m sprint performance were significantly improved after WBV and BFRT + WBV interventions (p < 0.05), 0-20 m sprint performance was significantly improved after all three interventions (p < 0.05), 2) After BFRT + WBV intervention, the EMG amplitude of the vastus lateralis and soleus were significantly improved. Greater increases in EMG activity of the tibialis anterior muscle (p < 0.05)and blood lactate (p < 0.05)were observed following BFRT intervention compared to BFRT + WBV intervention. Conclusion: For sprint performance, BFRT and WBV had similar post-activation enhancement effects to BFRT + WBV, and the metabolic accumulation immediately following the BFRT were higher than that following BFRT + WBV in male sprinters."

      "abstract": "Human skin wounds pose a gathering threat to the public health, carrying an immense epidemiologic and financial burden. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (NP) treatments have been proposed to the management of wound healing. Physical exercise is a strong NP intervention considered for patients in wound healing. Particularly, a type of exercise intervention known as whole-body vibration (WBV) exercise has gained increasing interest. WBV exercise is generated due to the transmission of mechanical vibrations, produced by a vibrating platform, to the body. The aim of this review was to summarize studies in experimental animal models using WBV exercise in wound healing. Searches were performed in EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science including publications on 21 November 2022 using the string \"whole body vibration\" AND \"wound healing\" (animal or mice or mouse or rat or rodent). The SYRCLE tool was used to assess the risk of bias (RoB). From 48 studies, five studies met the inclusion criteria. RoB indicated that none of the studies fulfilled all methodological analyzed criteria, resulting in possible biases. The studies were homogeneous, and results suggest beneficial effects of WBV exercise in wound healing, mainly related to enhancing angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, reducing the blood glucose level and enhancing blood microcirculation, by increasing myofiber growth and rapid re-epithelialization. In conclusion, the various biological effects of the response to the WBV exercise indicate the relevance of this intervention in wound healing in animals. Moreover, considering the translation approach, it is possible to speculate that the beneficial effects of this non-pharmacological therapy might justify clinical trials for wound healing also in humans, after criterion evaluation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whole-body vibration (WBV) is a therapeutic exercise tool that can be used in children with cerebral palsy (CP). A low vibration frequency with different protocols has been suggested, but no optimal dose has been explicitly indicated. We aimed to determine the superiority of a gradually increased 7-18 Hz WBV protocol over a static 11 Hz WBV and the immediate and short-term effects of WBV training on improving spasticity, functional strength, balance, and walking ability in children with spastic CP. METHODS: Twenty-four participants with CP (mean age: 11.5 ± 2.9 years) were randomly allocated into protocols of a static 11 Hz vibration frequency group (SVF) or one that increased from a 7 to an 18 Hz vibration frequency (IVF) (n = 12/group). The WBV programmes were completed for 30 min/session/day to identify immediate effects, and the short-term programme then continued for four days/week for eight weeks. RESULTS: Modified Ashworth Scale scores significantly and immediately improved in the IVF group (hip adductor and knee extensor, p < 0.05), and after eight weeks showed significant improvement in the SVF group (ankle plantar flexor, p < 0.05). Within groups, the Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSTS), the Time Up and Go Test and the Functional Reach Test significantly improved in the SVF group, whereas only the FTSTS improved in the IVF group (p < 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences at the eight-week postintervention, except reduced spasticity. CONCLUSIONS: A protocol of 7-18 Hz WBV seems to offer superior immediate results in terms of improved spasticity; however, a static 11 Hz protocol appears to offer superior results after eight weeks, although the two protocols did not differ significantly in effects on physical performance. This finding may facilitate preparations to normalise muscle tone before functional mobility therapy. The study results may support future studies about the dose-response of WBV frequency."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Females with cardiovascular disease seem more vulnerable to develop concomitant mental problems, such as depression and cognitive decline. Although exercise is shown beneficial in cardiovascular disease as well as in mental functions, these patients may be incapable or unmotivated to perform exercise. Whole body vibration (WBV) could provide a passive alternative to exercise. Aim of the present study was to compare WBV to exercise after isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial damage in female rats, regarding effects on heart, brain and behavior. METHODS: One week after ISO (70 mg/kg s.c., on 2 consecutive days) or saline injections, 12 months old female rats were assigned to WBV (10 minutes daily), treadmill running (30 minutes daily) or pseudo intervention for 5 weeks. During the last 10 days, behavioral tests were performed regarding depressive-like behavior, cognitive function, and motor performance. Rats were sacrificed, brains and hearts were dissected for (immuno)histochemistry. RESULTS: Significant ISO-induced cardiac collagen deposition (0.67 ± 0.10 vs 0.18 ± 0.03%) was absent after running (0.45 ± 0.26 vs 0.46 ± 0.08%), but not after WBV (0.83 ± 0.12 vs 0.41 ± 0.05%). However, WBV as well as running significantly reduced hippocampal (CA3) collagen content in ISO-treated rats. Significant regional differences in hippocampal microglia activity and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression were observed. Significant ISO-induced CA1 microglia activation was reduced after WBV as well as running, while opposite effects were observed in the CA3; significant reduction after ISO that was restored by WBV and running. Both WBV and running reversed the ISO-induced increased BDNF expression in the CA1, Dentate gyrus and Hilus, but not in the CA3 area. Whereas running had no significant effect on behavior in the ISO-treated rats, WBV may be associated with short-term spatial memory in the novel location recognition test. CONCLUSION: Although the female rats did not show the anticipated depressive-like behavior or cognitive decline after ISO, our data indicated regional effects on neuroinflammation and BDNF expression in the hippocampus, that were merely normalized by both WBV and exercise. Therefore, apart from the potential concern about the lack of cardiac collagen reduction, WBV may provide a relevant alternative for physical exercise."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the core cause of dementia in elderly populations. One of the main hallmarks of AD is extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation (APP-pathology) associated with glial-mediated neuroinflammation. Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) is a passive form of exercise, but its effects on AD pathology are still unknown. METHODS: Five months old male J20 mice (n = 26) and their wild type (WT) littermates (n = 24) were used to investigate the effect of WBV on amyloid pathology and the healthy brain. Both J20 and WT mice underwent WBV on a vibration platform or pseudo vibration treatment. The vibration intervention consisted of 2 WBV sessions of 10 min per day, five days per week for five consecutive weeks. After five weeks of WBV, the balance beam test was used to assess motor performance. Brain tissue was collected to quantify Aβ deposition and immunomarkers of astrocytes and microglia. RESULTS: J20 mice have a limited number of plaques at this relatively young age. Amyloid plaque load was not affected by WBV. Microglia activation based on IBA1-immunostaining was significantly increased in the J20 animals compared to the WT littermates, whereas CD68 expression was not significantly altered. WBV treatment was effective to ameliorate microglia activation based on morphology in both J20 and WT animals in the Dentate Gyrus, but not so in the other subregions. Furthermore, GFAP expression based on coverage was reduced in J20 pseudo-treated mice compared to the WT littermates and it was significantly reserved in the J20 WBV vs. pseudo-treated animals. Further, only for the WT animals a tendency of improved motor performance was observed in the WBV group compared to the pseudo vibration group. CONCLUSION: In accordance with the literature, we detected an early plaque load, reduced GFAP expression and increased microglia activity in J20 mice at the age of ~ 6 months. Our findings indicate that WBV has beneficial effects on the early progression of brain pathology. WBV restored, above all, the morphology of GFAP positive astrocytes to the WT level that could be considered the non-pathological and hence \"healthy\" level. Next experiments need to be performed to determine whether WBV is also affective in J20 mice of older age or other AD mouse models.",

DESIGN AND SETTING: Repeated measures randomized controlled design. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four independent living older adults were recruited and were randomly assigned to the whole-body vibration or control group. INTERVENTION: Participants performed three sessions of whole-body vibration training per week with a vibration frequency of 20 Hz or with only an audio recording of the vibration noise. An assessment of balance and fall outcomes was performed prior to, immediately following, and two-months after the completion of the training program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Composite balance scores from the Berg Balance Scale and treadmill fall rates were assessed pre-training, post-training, and two-months post-training. RESULTS: Seventeen participants completed the study. No between groups differences were found (p<0.05) in the measures of balance or fall rates. CONCLUSIONS: Findings revealed that six weeks of whole-body vibration was not effective in improving balance scores or fall rates."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of whole-body vibration training on lower limb motor function in children with cerebral palsy in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Two independent reviewers systematically searched the records of nine databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, EMBASE, CNKI, etc.) from inception to December 2022. Tools from the Cochrane Collaboration were used to assess risk of bias. Standard meta-analyses were performed using Stata 16.0 and Revman 5.3. For continuous variables, the arms difference was calculated as the weighted mean difference (WMD) between the values before and after the intervention and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: Of the 472 studies identified, 13 (total sample size 451 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that WBV training could effectively improve GMFM88-D [WMD = 2.46, 95% CI (1.26, 3.67), P<0.01] and GMFM88-E [WMD = 3.44, 95% CI (1.21, 5.68), P = 0.003], TUG [WMD = -3.17, 95% CI (-5.11, -1.24), P = 0.001], BBS [WMD = 4.00,95% CI (3.29, 4.71), P<0. 01] and the range of motion of ankle joint and the angle of ankle joint during muscle reaction in children with cerebral palsy. The effect of WBV training on 6MWT walking speed [WMD = 47.64, 95% CI (-25.57, 120.85), p = 0.20] in children with cerebral palsy was not significantly improved. CONCLUSION: WBV training is more effective than other types of conventional physical therapy in improving the lower limb motor function of children with cerebral palsy. The results of this meta-analysis strengthen the evidence of previous individual studies, which can be applied to the clinical practice and decision-making of WBV training and rehabilitation in children with cerebral palsy.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: several studies have reported improved neuromuscular parameters in response to whole-body vibration (WBV). This is likely achieved by modulation of the central nervous system (CNS). Reduced recruitment threshold (RT), which is the % of Maximal Voluntary Force (%MVF) at which a given Motor Unit (MU) is recruited, may be responsible for the force/power improvements observed in several studies. Methods: 14 men (25 ± 2.3 years; BMI = 23.3 ± 1.5 kg m2 MVF: 319.82 ± 45.74 N) performed trapezoidal isometric contractions of the tibialis anterior (TA) at 35-50-70 %MVF before and after three conditions: WBV, STAND (standing posture), and CNT (no intervention). The vibration was applied through a platform for targeting the TA. High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) recordings and analysis were used to detect changes in the RT and Discharge Rate (DR) of the MUs. Results: Mean motor unit recruitment threshold (MURT) reached 32.04 ± 3.28 %MVF before and 31.2 ± 3.72 %MVF after WBV, with no significant differences between conditions (p > 0.05). Additionally, no significant changes were found in the mean motor unit discharge rate (before WBV: 21.11 ± 2.94 pps; after WBV: 21.19 ± 2.17 pps). Discussion: The present study showed no significant changes in motor unit properties at the base of neuromuscular changes documented in previous studies. Further investigations are needed to understand motor unit responses to different vibration protocols and the chronic effect of vibration exposure on motor control strategies."

This systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effects of whole-body vibration exercise (WBVE) in metabolic syndrome (MSy) individuals. (2) Methods: An electronic search in Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PEDro, and CINAHL databases in December 2022 was performed. Data regarding the included studies were extracted. The level of evidence, the methodological quality, and the risk of bias of each selected publication were individually evaluated. (3) Results: Eight studies were included in the systematic review and four studies in the meta-analysis, with a mean methodological quality score on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro scale) of 5.6, considered \"fair\" quality. The qualitative results suggested positive effects of the systemic vibration therapy in relevant outcomes, such as quality of life, functionality, pain level, trunk flexibility, cardiovascular responses (blood pressure and heart rate), neuromuscular activation, range of motion of the knees, rating of perceived exertion, and body composition. The quantitative results, with weighted mean differences, standard mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated. Conclusions: WBVE may be an alternative capable of interfering with physical-mainly for flexibility with weighted mean differences (1.70; 95% CI 0.15, 3.25; n = 39)-functional, psychosocial, neuromuscular, emotional parameters, and consequently contribute to improvements in metabolic health and reduce the cardiovascular risk factor in MSy individuals. Nevertheless, further additional studies are required to understand the long-term effects of WBVE on MSy and its complications in a better way.

Three groups are distinguished: the experimental group-participating in WBVT (n = 17); the comparison group-implementing the same physical exercise protocol without the vibration factor (n = 12); and the control group-no intervention (n = 17). In the experimental and comparison group, blood is collected before and after the first and last training, while in the control group, blood is collected twice, 3 months apart. After a series of WBVT, a significant decrease in the mean erythrocyte volume and mean hemoglobin mass in erythrocytes, as well as a slight increase in the mean erythrocyte hemoglobin concentration, is found, and the effect of the last training is a significant decrease in plasma volume. Under the influence of repeated WBVT, there is an increase in erythrocyte deformability at low shear stress and an increase in the aggregation amplitude.

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Mitochondrial dysfunction and redox imbalance seem to be involved in fibromyalgia (FM) pathogenesis. The results of our previous studies suggest that whole-body vibration training (WBVT) would improve redox status markers, increase blood irisin levels, and ameliorate the body composition of women with FM. (2) Objective: The current study aimed to investigate WBVT on oxidative stress markers, plasma irisin levels, and body composition in women with FM. (3) Methods: Forty women with FM were randomized into WBVT or untrained (UN) groups. Before and after 6 weeks of WBVT, body composition was assessed by dual-energy radiological absorptiometry (DXA), and inflammatory marker activities were measured by enzymatic assay. (4) Results: Body composition, blood irisin levels, and oxidative stress markers were similar between UN and WBVT groups before the intervention. After 6 weeks of intervention, the WBVT group presented higher irisin levels (WBVT: 316.98 ± 109.24 mg·dL³, WBVT: 477.61 ± 267.92 mg·dL³, p = 0.01) and lower TBARS levels (UN: 0.39 ± 0.02 nmol MDA/mg protein, WBVT: 0.24 ± 0.06 nmol MDA/mg protein, p = 0.001) and visceral adipose tissue mass (UN: 1.37 ± 0.49 kg, WBVT: 0.69 ± 0.54 kg, p = 0.001) compared to the UN group. (5) Conclusions: Six weeks of WBVT improves blood redox status markers, increases irisin levels, and reduces visceral adipose tissue mass, favoring less cell damage and more outstanding oxidative balance in women with FM."

METHODS: A prospective, randomized, pre-post-test, single-blind, controlled trial was conducted in 105 women diagnosed with PMS. They were randomized into three equal groups. All women received magnesium and vitamin B complex supplementation once daily. WBV training was added three times per week to the WBV group. The aerobic exercise group added aerobic exercise three times per week, while the control group received no additional intervention. The Premenstrual Syndrome Questionnaire (PMSQ) was used to assess PMS symptoms. Blood analysis was performed to measure hormone assays (estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and cortisol) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein at the start and after the end of the treatment program. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between WBV and aerobic exercise according to PMSQ and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = 0.99 and P = 0.98, respectively), but there was a statistically significant difference between both groups in cortisol, progesterone, prolactin, and estradiol (P = 0.001), with more favor given to the WBV group. CONCLUSION: WBV and aerobic exercise have positive effects on women with PMS, with more favor given to WBV.",

      "abstract": "Whole-body vibration therapy is an intentional biomechanical stimulation of the body using various frequencies of vibrations with the motive of health improvement. Ever since its discovery, this therapy has been extensively used in physiotherapeutic measures and the sports industry. For its property of increasing bone mass and density, space agencies use this therapy on astronauts who return to Earth after long-term space missions to regain lost bone and muscle mass. The potential of this therapy to restore bone mass encouraged researchers to look for its scope in the treatment of age-related bone degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia, as well as in the correction of posture control and gait in geriatrics and post-menopausal women. Osteoporosis and osteopenia account for roughly half of all fractures worldwide. These degenerative diseases also cause gait and posture changes. Bisphosphonates, monoclonal antibodies, parathyroid hormone fragments, hormone replacement therapies, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation are among the medical treatments available. Lifestyle changes and physical exercise are advised. However, vibration therapy's scope as a treatment option is yet to be explored. The safe range of frequency, amplitude, duration, and intensity of the therapy is still to be determined. This article is a review of the results of various clinical trials done in the last 10 years that target the effect of vibration therapy in both osteoporotic women and the elderly for the treatment of such ailments and deformities. We collected data from PubMed using advanced search and applied the exclusion criteria. In total, we analyzed nine clinical trials."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the main objectives of stroke rehabilitation is to alleviate post-stroke spasticity. Over the recent years, many studies have explored the potential benefits of whole-body vibration (WBV) treatment for post-stroke spasticity, but it is still controversial. OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of WBV for post-stroke spasticity and determine the appropriate application situation. METHODS: From their establishment until August 2022, the following databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published in either English or Chinese were taken into consideration. We independently filtered the research, gathered the data from the studies, and evaluated the research quality (Cochrane RoB tool) and the overall evidence quality (GRADE). Rev Man 5.4 software was utilized to conduct statistical analysis. RESULTS: In this analysis, 11 RCTs with 475 patients that reported on the effectiveness of WBV therapy for post-stroke spasticity were taken into account. Compared to the control groups, the results revealed that WBV combined with conventional rehabilitation at a vibration frequency lower than 20 Hz (SMD = -0.58, 95% CI: -0.98 to -0.19, P = 0.004) was more effective in relieving upper (SMD = -0.53, 95% CI: -1.04 to 0.03, P = 0.03) and lower limb spasticity (SMD = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.01, P = 0.04); similarly, it was superior for patients aged under 60 years (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.17, P = 0.0008) with acute and subacute stroke (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.09, P = 0.01). The valid vibration for reducing spasticity was found to last for 10 min (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.07, P = 0.02). None of the included studies revealed any serious adverse impact. CONCLUSION: Moderate-quality evidence demonstrated when WBV was used as an adjuvant, vibration <20 Hz for 10 min was effective and secure in treating upper and lower limb spasticity in patients with acute and subacute stroke under the age of 60 years.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: After a stroke, patients usually suffer from dysfunction, such as decreased balance ability, and abnormal walking function. Whole-body vibration training can promote muscle contraction, stimulate the proprioceptive system, enhance the muscle strength of low limbs and improve motor control ability. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of whole-body vibration training on the balance and walking function of patients with stroke. METHODS: PubMed, CNKI, VIP, CBM, EBSCO, Embase and Web of Science were searched. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of whole-body vibration training on the balance and walking function of patients with stroke were collected. The search time ranged from the date of database construction to November 2022. The included trials were evaluated by the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The meta-analysis was performed using two software packages, consisting of RevMan 5.4 and Stata 12.2. If the results included in the literature were continuous variables, use the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for statistics. RESULTS: (1) A total of 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1089 patients were included. (2) The results of meta-analysis showed that: compared with the controls, step length (MD = 6.12, 95%CI [5.63, 6.62], p < 0.001), step speed (MD = 0.14, 95%CI [0.09, 0.20], p < 0.001), cadence (MD = 9.03, 95%CI [2.23, 15.83], p = 0.009), stride length (MD = 6.74, 95%CI [-3.47, 10.01], p < 0.001), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (MD = 4.08, 95%CI [2.39, 5.76], p < 0.001), Timed Up-and-Go test (TUGT) (MD = -2.88, 95%CI [-4.94, 0.81], p = 0.006), 10-meter Walk Test (10MWT) (MD = -2.69, 95%CI [-3.35, -2.03], p < 0.001), functional ambulation category scale (FAC) (MD = 0.78, 95%CI [0.65, 0.91], p < 0.001), Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of lower extremity (FMA-LE) (MD = 4.10, 95%CI [2.01, 6.20], p = 0.0001). (3) The results of subgroup analysis showed that, compared with other vibration frequencies, at 20-30 Hz frequency, WBV training had an obvious improvement effect only in TUGT. (4) The safety analysis showed that WBV training may be safe. CONCLUSION: Whole-body vibration training has a positive effect on the balance and walking function of patients with stroke. Thus, whole-body vibration training is a safe treatment method to improve the motor dysfunction of patients with stroke.

      "abstract": "Whole-body vibration (WBV) is a novel exercise training measure that promotes the muscle strength, flexibility, and balance abilities of elderly groups. The feasibility and applicability of 20-30 min (lowering a heat pack at 73 °C by wrapping it in multiple layers of towels to 40-43 °C before it touched the skin) thermotherapy are increasingly being demonstrated by applications and clinical trials. Studies show that it increases the flexibility of macules and ligament. However, no studies have examined the interactions between the pre-exercise and post-exercise application of heat therapy (duration a training course). Therefore, this study investigates the effects of WBV and heat therapy on the muscle strength, flexibility, and balance abilities of elderly groups. Eighty middle-age and elderly participants with no regular exercise habits were enrolled in this study. They were randomly assigned to a WBV group, a WBV plus heat therapy group, a heat therapy alone group, and a control group. The WBV groups underwent 5-min, fixed-amplitude (4 mm), thrice-weekly WBV training sessions for 3 consecutive months on a WBV training machine. Participants' balance was measured using the limits of stability (LOS) test on a balance system. The pretest and posttest knee extensor and flexor strength were tested using an isokinetic lower extremity dynamometer. Pretest and posttest flexibility changes were measured using the sit-and-reach test. Significantly larger pretest and posttest differences in flexibility and muscle strength were observed in the WBV and WBV plus heat therapy groups. The addition of heat therapy to WBV resulted in the largest flexibility improvements.",
