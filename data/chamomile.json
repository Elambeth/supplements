      "abstract": "This research was conducted in a greenhouse to examine the effects of solid biochar (25 g kg-1 soil), and biochar-based nanoparticles of magnesium (BNP-MgO), iron (BNP-Fe3O4), and magnesium + iron (BNP-MgO + BNP-Fe3O4) in comparison with control (soil) on German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.) under salinity levels (0.9, 6, and 12 dS m-1 as non-saline treatment and moderate and high salinities, respectively). Salinity increased sodium uptake, generation of reactive oxygen species and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities, leading to a reduction in leaf nutrients and pigments, and organs masses. High salinity significantly decreased the essential oil percentage and yield. However, solid and especially enriched biochars with BNP-MgO, BNP-Fe3O4, and their combined form reduced hydrogen peroxide and consequently enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities under saline conditions. The BNP-MgO was the best treatment for enhancing leaf pigments, and the BNP-Fe3O4 was generally the best choice for improving organs masses and essential oil percentage and yield of chamomile under salinity. Therefore, solid and especially enriched biochars, due to their excellent physicochemical properties, were suggested as the suitable soil amendments to mitigate salt toxicity and improve the growth and essential oil production of medicinal plants in the greenhouse and field cultivations."

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the effect of Chamomile flower powder (CFP) on performance traits, lipid profile and morphology jejunum of Japanese quail from 7 to 35 days of age. A total of 200 7-day-old male Japanese quail were as randomly distributed to 5 treatments, with 4 replicates, and 10 birds in each pen. The experimental treatments included (T1) a control diet (treated with basal diet only), (T2-T5) basal diet supplemented with of 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 % of CFP, respectively. Live body weight (LBW) and Feed intake (FI) were determined weekly, and then feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated. At the end of the study 5 birds with an average weight close to the same treatment were selected from each experimental treatment andblood and intestine (jejunum section) samples were collected at 35 days of age for further analysis. Blood samples were collected from the axillary vein and poured into test tubes without heparin. Blood serum was centrifuged and stored at -20ºC until testing. Then, the birds were slaughtered and after opening the abdominal cavity, a section (3 cm) from the middle part of the jejunum was separated and kept in 10% formalin (pH=7.2) to study the jejunum morphology. The results showed that live body weight, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were significantly improved (P<0.05) in the birds CFP-fed compared to the control. The addition of 1% and 1.5% CFP (T3 and T4) to the basal diet showed the best performance results. The level of HDL was significantly (P<0.05) decreased in the birds fed CFP (T3 and T4) compared to the control. Other lipid profile parameters were not significantly (P>0.05) affected by the CFP used, although the results showed a numerical trend of decrease compared to the control. Villus height and depth crypt of the bird jejunum significantly increased (P<0.05) compared to the control. In conclusion, these results suggest that dietary supplementation with 1% and/or 1.5% CFP has beneficial effect on growth performance, lipid profile and jejunum morphometric of quails.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of combining natural herbs like chamomile and saffron for the management of anxiety and depression. METHODS: A rodent model of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety, secondary to streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus was made. A total of 6 rat groups were chosen; healthy and diseased controls; and diseased test groups of fluoxetine, saffron, chamomile, and combined saffron and chamomile treated (n = 6/group). Activity by forced swim test (FST), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and correlations with biochemical markers like serum glucose, tryptophan, C-reactive protein (CRP), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 5-hydrox-ytryptamine 2C receptor (5HT2CR) expression, were assessed at the end of the 3rd week of the treatment. A one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Tukey's test was applied. RESULTS: The combined herbal treatment group showed significantly better (P <0.05) than all other groups in terms of anti-hyperglycemic effect. All treatments improved the CRP levels; however, the combination group was also significantly better than fluoxetine and the individual herb groups. Only the herb groups showed efficacy in the FST with added benefits of the combination group over the healthy controls and similar trends in the EPMT. However, expression of 5HT2CR was repressed while BDNF was elevated through treatment. CONCLUSION: This study shows that in comparison to treatment with a SSRI, and individual herbs, the combination of chamomile and saffron showed overall improved outcomes.",

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of chamomile and flaxseed on pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea in endometriosis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted on 102 endometriosis patients referred to Reyhane Infertility Center of Qom University of Medical Sciences, Iran, from July 2021 to March 2022. Patients were divided into three groups: chamomile, flaxseed, and placebo, using the block randomization method. Patients used 1000 mg capsules (three times a day) for 8 weeks. A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure the severity of pain. Pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea were assessed on three occasions Data were analyzed using the Chi-square, repeated measures ANCOVA, and ANOVA. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the three groups regarding dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, or dyspareunia (p > 0.05). The mean score of pelvic pain (on one and two-month follow-ups) in the chamomile and flaxseed groups (F = 383.07, p < 0.001) was lower than that in the placebo group. The mean score of dyspareunia (on one and two-month follow-ups) in the chamomile and flaxseed groups was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (F2 = 479.34, p < 0.001). The mean score of dysmenorrhea on one and two-month follow-ups (F2 = 385.67, p < 0.001) in the chamomile and flaxseed groups was lower than that in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Chamomile and flaxseed may reduce pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea associated with endometriosis."

      "abstract": "Background: Lymphedema is one of the disturbing complications after breast cancer treatment that may affect the quality of life (QoL) of breast cancer survivors (BCSs). Methods: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 63 patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) were included in the study. Group A received standard complete decongestive therapy (CDT), group B received CDT with olive oil, and group C received CDT with chamomile and olive oil. Lymphedema volume and range of motion (RoM) were measured at the beginning of the study and at sessions 7, 14, and 21. Patients' QoL was measured using the Short Form 36 questionnaire at baseline, at the end of the trial, and 1 month after the trial. For statistical analysis, SPSS software with a significance level of p < 0.05 was used. Results: The mean age of patients was 55.4 ± 10.1 years. Although the volume of lymphedema was reduced and RoM was increased in all groups, there was no significant difference between the three groups. However, the change in volume and RoM was more evident in group C. Moreover, the effect of interventions on health-related QoL dimensions in all groups was not statistically significant. However, in some dimensions, the score did not decrease in group B during follow-up. Conclusions: Chamomile and olive oils are tolerable for BCSs with BCRL; however, adding this intervention to CDT seems to have no superiority to CDT alone.",

Anxiety symptoms and deviations in vital signs are frequently manifest in patients admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of citrus aurantium and chamomile aromas on anxiety levels and vital signs of patients hospitalized in CCU. METHODS: In this clinical research trial (CRT), a total of 76 hospitalized patients in the CCU were randomly assigned to two groups. The intervention group received aromatherapy using a blend of chamomile and citrus aurantium essences at a ratio of 2:0.5 on an eye pad. They inhaled the aromas from a distance of 10 cm for three nights. Vital signs were recorded every 6 h. Spielberger's anxiety questionnaire was administered before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using independent t-tests, paired t-tests, Chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests, and the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. RESULTS: Before the aromatherapy, the mean (SD) scores of state and trait anxiety in the intervention group were 57.9 (11.4) and 50 (12.5) respectively, after the intervention, these scores decreased to 35.3 (8.4) and 38.5 (8.2), and the paired t-test revealed a significant difference between them (p < 0.001). Before the intervention there was no significant difference in the mean scores of state and trait anxiety between the two groups, (p > 0.05), however following the intervention, a significant difference was observed (p < 0.001). Additionally, the intervention resulted in the recovery of patients' heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed, application of citrus aurantium and chamomile aromas significantly lower anxiety levels and enhance the hemodynamic status of patients in the CCU. It may be suggested as a beneficial nursing intervention for these patients."

This study evaluated the efficacy of chamomile tincture and lidocaine hydrochloride (CLH) gel in mitigating periodontal inflammation and bone loss and uncovered the molecular mechanisms involved, both in vitro and in vivo. Methods: A periodontitis model was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by ligating the mandibular first molars. Sixty rats were divided into four groups: control (C), periodontitis (PD), periodontitis + CLH gel once daily (G1), and periodontitis + CLH gel thrice daily (G3). Clinical, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), biological, and histological evaluations were performed, focusing on osteoclastogenesis, osteogenesis, and inflammatory cytokine production. The effect of CLH gel on inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 cells was also assessed through co-culture assays under Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) infection, with RNA-sequencing, qPCR, and Western blot analyses to explore underlying mechanisms. Results: CLH gel significantly reduced gingival and systemic inflammation and mitigated bone loss by enhancing the bone volume to tissue volume ratio and trabecular thickness via the RANKL/OPG axis in rats. The G3 group showed marked reductions in osteoclasts and increases in osterix-positive cells compared to other groups. In vitro, CLH gel reduced the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages in the periodontitis microenvironment by modulating Type II interferon (IFN-γ) networks. Conclusions: CLH gel reduced inflammation and bone loss in rat periodontitis, promoting osteogenesis and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. It also suppressed macrophage inflammation via Type II interferon networks under P. gingivalis stimulation. These findings suggest that CLH gel has potential as an adjunctive therapy for periodontitis."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying sleep, or both. Aromatherapy is a commonly used complementary and alternative medicine practice by persons with insomnia. Previous studies have shown that use of chamomile oil during massage therapy improves the quality of sleep (QoS). However, to our knowledge, no randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of chamomile oil inhalation on the treatment of insomnia. The present study evaluated the effect of chamomile oil inhalation on QoS and insomnia severity in persons with insomnia. METHODS: A total of 80-participants ages 18-35 with insomnia were randomly allocated to aromatherapy group (AG; n = 40) or a control group (CG; n = 40). Those in the AG group received chamomile oil inhalation, while those in the CG engaged in their normal routine for 10 minutes a day, daily for 15 days. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were administered before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Within-group analysis showed a significant reduction both in PSQI and ISI scores among those in the AG (P < 0.001 for both scores), whereas the CG reported a significant reduction in PSQI score (P = 0.033) and no significant changes in ISI score (P = 0.068). The between groups analysis after the intervention demonstrated a significant reduction in PSQI and ISI scores in the AG group (P < 0.001 for both) compared to the CG. No participant in either group reported adverse events during or after the study. CONCLUSION: Fifteen days of chamomile oil inhalation before bedtime reduced insomnia severity and enhanced the quality of sleep for young adults suffering from insomnia. Further studies are needed to replicate the results of this study using an active control group."

Ribociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor used in the treatment of breast cancer, has been linked to hepatotoxicity and may contribute to the development of Hepatocellular carcinoma in rats. This Study aims to assess hepatoprotective effect of chamomile oil and olive leaf extracts against ribociclib-induced Hepatotoxicity in rats. A total of 40 adult male albino rats aged 9-10 weeks were utilized in this experiment. These rats were divided into four groups, (N=10). Group A (control) comprised normal rats administered 1 ml (10 ml/kg/day) of normal saline daily. Conversely, group B rats were administered 5 mg/kg Ribociclib (n = 10), while group C was administered 5 mg/kg Ribociclib with a 500 mg/kg/day dose of chamomile oil. Group D was given 5 mg \\kg Ribociclib in combination with 200 mg/kg/day of olive leaves. After the trial, the animals were sacrificed, blood samples were collected for biochemical tests, and the liver tissue was processed for histological examination. The results of histology, and biochemistry parameter analysis, indicated that co-administration of Ribociclib and chamomile oil plays a decisive role in mitigating the hepatotoxicity result from Ribociclib-induced liver injuries in rats as demonstrated by histological and biochemical parameters.The levels of cholesterol and LDL in the blood were significantly lower (P < 0.01) after administering chamomile oil compared to the control group. The results of the current study demonstrated that the simultaneous use of chamomile oil and olive leaf extract significantly reduced the liver damage caused by Ribociclib and improved the lipid profile in Albino rats. Additionally, the use of chamomile extract notably lowered urea levels (p < 0.01), indicating a protective effect on the kidneys.",

That is why the idea of a biotextronics system for preventive and supportive treatment came to be. The system is a kind of a therapeutic clothing in the form of underwear integrated with a four-layer pantiliner with biological active compounds (from chamomile essential oil) immobilized on the insert with a cellulose agar or microcrystalline cellulose agar film. In this research, the outer part of the insert was investigated for its ability to release compounds with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity under the temperature of the treatment (40 °C). The research was conducted on the day of the insert preparation (day 0) and also after 7, 14, 28, and 56 days to test the ability of the insert to be stored without changing its properties. The results showed that even after 56 days of storage, there are compounds released that are known to have antibacterial activity, such as α-bisabolol. The system requires further tests involving bacteria; however, chamomile essential oil seems to be good substrate for biotextronics systems for preventive and supportive treatment of lower urinary tract inflammations."

The present study employed MTT assay, ELISA, and qRT-PCR techniques to assess the possible impact of the investigated extracts on PCa in PC-3 cells. The findings indicate that ginger exhibited a noteworthy cytotoxic impact on PC-3. Remarkably, the treatment of PCa cells with ginger significantly increased relative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) production compared to those treated with chamomile and green tea extracts. Autophagy may play a crucial role in the context of chemotherapy. Modifying autophagy through its induction or inhibition is a promising and innovative approach to controlcancer progression. Accordingly, it was found that ginger extract affects protein expression levels of autophagy markers LC3B, ATg12, and pro-apoptotic signaling, including the Caspase-3 signaling pathway. The ELISA findings revealed a significant rise in the average levels of IL-1β and IL-8 after a 12-hour interval. To conclude, it can be inferred that ginger extract possesses the capability to control the production of inflammatory cytokines. Alternatively, utilizing herbal remedies containing ginger as a viable and secure means of treating PCa as an anticancer agent is possible."

Worldwide, breast cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. The popularity of treating diseases using alternative and complementary medicines has increased in recent decades; many of these are derived from plants. Chamomile has a beneficial effect in treating many diseases, there for the purpose of this work is to study how chamomile protect against cardiac damage and toxicity brought on by Ehrlich solid tumor (EST) in adult female mice. 40 female mice were distributed in 4 groups (control, chamomile, EST, EST+chamomile). The research results indicated that EST caused significant alterations in cardiac function and structure. EST induced a significant elevation in serum creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and myoglobin (MB), potassium, chloride ions, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cardiac tissue damage, apoptotic P53 and Caspase 3 expressions while levels of sodium ions and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were significantly decreased. Treatments of EST with chamomile improved the biochemical, histopathological, and Immunohistochemical alterations. This suggests that chamomile may be useful as an adjuvant for the treatment and prevention of cardiac toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent chronic skin condition characterized by complex immune responses. Chamomile possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties and has been widely used in treating various skin diseases. This study aimed to assess the therapeutic benefits of chamomile volatile oil nanoemulsion gels (CVO-NEGs) for the treatment of AD. Chamomile volatile oil nanoemulsions (CVO-NEs) were prepared using the phase transition method, yielding spherical nanoparticles with a particle size of 19.07 nm. Subsequently, Bletilla striata polysaccharides were employed to encapsulate CVO-NEs, resulting in the formation of CVO-NEGs. In vivo studies demonstrated that the preparation of CVO-NEGs enhanced the biological activity of volatile oil in AD therapy. Histopathological results indicated that CVO-NEGs reduced skin damage, epidermal thickness, and mast cell infiltration. CVO-NEGs suppressed IgG production and reduced the levels of cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-4, and IFN-γ, in AD mice. Furthermore, flow cytometry revealed that CVO-NEGs were involved in regulating the differentiation of CD4+ T cell subsets. The immune imbalance of Th1/Th2 in AD mice can be controlled, resulting in a reduction in the hypersensitivity reaction caused by excessive Th2 activation. In conclusion, the present study confirms that CVO-NEGs have the potential to serve as an effective alternative treatment for AD.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The use of natural and herbal products as alternative therapies, in conjunction with blood glucose-lowering medications, is on the rise for patients with diabetes. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and comprehensive meta-analysis of both human and animal models to investigate the impact of chamomile consumption on glycemic control. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on all published papers from January 1990 up to January 2022 via Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and ISI Web of Science. Human and animal articles evaluating the effect of chamomile on serum glycemic markers were included. We used the random-effects model to establish the pooled effect size. The dose-dependent effect was also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 4 clinical trials on human and 8 studies on animals met the inclusion criteria. With regard to RCTs, a favorable effect of chamomile consumption on serum fasting blood glucose (Standardized Mean Differences (SMD): -0.65, 95% CI: -1.00, -0.29, P < 0.001; I2 = 0%) and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels (SMD: -0.90, 95% CI: -1.39, -0.40, P < 0.001; I2 = 45.4%) was observed. Considering animal studies, consumption of chamomile extracts significantly reduced serum blood glucose (SMD: -4.37, 95% CI: -5.76, -2.98, P < 0.001; I2 = 61.2%). Moreover, each 100 mg/d increase in chamomile extract intervention resulted in a significantly declined blood glucose concentrations (MD: -54.35; 95% CI: -79.77, -28.93, P < 0.001; I2 = 94.8). CONCLUSION: The current meta-analysis revealed that chamomile consumption could exert favorable effects on serum blood glucose and HbA1C. However, additional randomized controlled trials are needed to further confirm these findings.

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorder is a prevalent psychiatric issue that affects 4.05% of the global population. As complementary and alternative medicine gains popularity, many individuals with anxiety symptoms seek herbal remedies. This systematic review aims to explore the sedative efficacy of chamomile as an herbal medicine for anxiety treatment. Our search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases until August 2023. Among 389 papers found, after removing duplicates and irrelevant papers, 10 clinical trials investigating the effect of oral consumption of chamomile on anxiety were included. Two researchers independently completed all steps, including the screening process and data extraction. Out of the 10 articles selected, 9 studies have concluded that chamomile is effective in reducing anxiety. Even though, the exact mechanism of chamomile's anxiolytic action is not well understood, evidence suggests that its active compounds, including apigenin, may modulate the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis by affecting neurotransmitter pathways. This systematic review showed that chamomile potentially has an anxiolytic effect. In addition, due to the side effects of drugs used to treat anxiety disorders, the use of chamomile seems to be effective and less dangerous."

The results indicated that the AFB1 treatment had lower values of performance, and carcass parameters compared to the Cha and AFLCha treatments. Furthermore, the Cha and AFLCha groups had lower values of liver and kidney function activities compared to the AFB1 treatment. The higher values of antioxidant enzymes were observed in Cha and AFLCha treatments than in the AFB1 treatment. AFB1 treatments had higher levels of malondialdehyde and liver functions with lower levels of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione and superoxide dismutase) compared to Cha and CON groups.

Corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and natural products (NPs) have been used as treatment. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of a NPs-based cream (Alantel®) to reduce the incidence of RD in women with breast cancer undergoing RT treatment. DESIGN: We conducted a controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: Radiation Oncology Unit of the Reina Sofía Hospital and 5 Primary Care centers of the Cordoba and Guadalquivir Health District (Spain). INTERVENTIONS: Patients assigned to the experimental group (GTA) were treated with Alantel, while those in the control group (GTE) were treated with a moisturizer and emollient cream. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variable was the incidence of RD. RD-free time, duration of RD, quality of life, and product safety were also assessed. RESULTS: Seventy patients were included in the study, 35 in the GTA and 35 in the GTE. The incidence of RD was lower in the GTA (71.4%) than in the GTE (91.4%) after 4 weeks of follow-up (RR = 0.78; NNT = 5; p < 0.031). The Skindex-29 questionnaire showed differences in the statement: \"My skin condition makes it hard to work or do hobbies\" (17.1% in the GTE vs. 2.9% in GTA; p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The higher efficacy of Alantel® compared to the control cream in reducing the incidence of RD in women with breast cancer has been demonstrated."

Current practice, however, discourages perioperative chamomile use due to a theoretical increase in bleeding. Therefore, we evaluated if chamomile acutely (within 4 h of ingestion) prolongs coagulation assays. METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers were randomized to receive 2 interventions in a crossover design: (a) single dose of chamomile extract capsule (500 mg) and (b) single dose of chamomile tea (3 g in 150 mL water). Interventions were separated at least 3 days apart from each other. Blood was sampled pre-ingestion, 2 h post-ingestion, and 4 h post-ingestion for each intervention. The primary outcome was the maximal change in prothrombin time (PT) before vs after each intervention. Secondary outcomes included changes in international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, reptilase time, and fibrinogen levels. RESULTS: All 8 subjects completed the study. The average pre-ingestion PT values for tea and capsules were 11.9 (1.1) s and 12.0 (0.9) s, respectively. Tea significantly increased the average maximum PT by 0.7 (0.2) s (P = 0.0078). Extract capsules increased the maximum PT by 0.3 (0.2) s (P = 0.06). Neither PT prolongation met the predefined 10% threshold for clinical significance. No significant changes in secondary outcomes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Chamomile tea ingestion prolongs PT. However, the clinical significance of this is unclear at this time and warrants further investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov Registration Number: NCT05272475.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dermatitis is a skin condition caused by multiple causes, including radiotherapy treatment. Pharmacological treatments can become chronic and are not exempt from side effects. The latest recommendations of the American Academy of Dermatology establish the use of natural, nourishing, and moisturizing cosmetic products as prevention and the first therapeutic step for dermatitis. Alantel® is a cream developed to reduce redness and irritation, promote the local immune system, combat immunosenescence, and promote the healing of epidermal lesions. The objective was to evaluate the effect of a cream (Alantel) based on natural products at high concentrations for the preventive and curative treatment (at early stages) of radiation-induced dermatitis in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Our protocol is an experimental, prospective, triple-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial with two parallel arms. The experimental group will be treated with Alantel, while the control group will receive another moisturizing cream. Radiotherapy oncology professionals will recruit a total of 88 patients (44 per comparison group) with breast cancer who will receive radiotherapy oncology treatment for 15 days, and they will be randomly allocated to the experimental or control group. Selected patients will be followed up for four visits by primary care physicians for up to 1 week after completion of radiotherapy. The main study variable will be the incidence rate of mild post-radiation dermatitis. An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed, applying a comparison test for independent means and proportions. A bivariate and multivariate analysis will also be developed to check the treatment effect, adjusting for predictive sociodemographic and clinical variables. DISCUSSION: By carrying out this clinical trial, it is expected to verify that Alantel cream, based on natural products at high concentrations, has advantages over a moisturizing cream for the preventive and curative treatment of RD in patients with breast cancer. The COVID-19 pandemic has been influenced by delaying the start of the study. One of the main limitations of this study will be the time required to recruit the patients from the planned sample, given that the selection criteria are restrictive and, although the study is multicenter, recruitment will be coordinated through a single service on radiotherapy oncology.

Similarly, medicinal plants, such as chamomile (Matricaria recutita) are also used with the same purpose. To evaluate tissue repair in the dorsum of the tongue of rats under topical use of chamomile alone and in association with LPBM. Seventy-five male Wistar rats received a standardized wound on the dorsum of the tongue and were allocated into experimental groups: Control (G1), Chamomile Fluid extract (G2), Chamomile Infusion (G3), Laser (G4), Chamomile Infusion + Laser (G5). Euthanasia was done on days 3, 7, and 14 after surgery. Ulcers were evaluated and measured with a caliper. Sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Picrosirius Red allowed evaluation of edema, inflammatory infiltrate, cellularity, and re-epithelialization and characterization of total collagen. Histomorphometric analysis of the percentage of total collagen, the distance from the basal layer to the epithelial surface, and the thickness of the stratum corneum were performed. The G2 and G4 groups modulated the exudative and proliferative phases of inflammation, both clinically and histologically. The G3 and G5 groups did not show significant differences in relation to the G1 group in most of the evaluated parameters. Chamomile fluid extract and LPBM alone showed better clinical and histological responses for tissue repair than the association between these therapeutic modalities. There were differences in the parameters of clinical, histological, and histomorphometric patterns between the experimental groups of the present investigation. The LPBM proved to be superior in the performed analysis.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes dementia among older adults, increasing the global burden of dementia. Therefore, this study investigates the potential neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anticancer effects of chamomile essential oil (CCO) in Alzheimer's disease. CCO's main volatile compounds (VOCs) were α-bisabolol, camazulene, and bisabolol oxide A, representing 81 % of all VOCs. CCO scavenged 93 % of DPPH free radicals and inhibited the pathogenic bacteria, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi, besides reducing 89 % of brain cancer cell lines (U87). Eighty albino rats were randomized into four groups: standard control, Alzheimer's disease group caused by AlCl3, and treated groups. The results indicated that the mean value of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid beta (Aβ), caspase-3, & B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was significantly elevated due to the harmful effect of AlCl3; however, CCO downregulated these values, and this effect was attributed to the considerable volatile compounds and phenolic compounds content. Additionally, CCO rats showed a significant increment in noradrenergic (NE), dopaminergic (DO), and serotoninergic systems with relative increases of 50, 50, and 14 % compared to diseased rats. The brain histology of CCO-treated rats showed a significant reduction in neuronal degeneration and improved brain changes, and its histology was close to that of the control brain. The results indicated that CCO offers a new strategy that could be used as an antioxidant and neuroprotective agent for AD due to its considerable contents of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds."

The present study investigated the possible antihypertensive cardiovascular effects of an herbal mixture extract of Hibiscus, Corn silk, Marjoram, and Chamomile. HPLC analysis of the water extract prepared from the aerial parts of four plants and their mixture was done to detect the most predominant compounds. A safety study was done prior to the efficacy study to determine the dose and ensure the extract's safety in female rats. Hypertension was induced in ovariectomized and non-ovariectomized rats by oral administration of 50 mg/kg of LName for 30 days; the hypertensive rats were classified into non-ovariectomized and ovariectomized untreated groups, treated groups with high and low doses of the mixture(150,300 mg/kg) given to ovariectomized and non-ovariectomized hypertensive groups and a standard group treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The untreated group showed significant elevation of blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, triglycerides, malondialdehyde, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, angiotensin-converting enzyme, C-reactive protein, and significantly lowered reduced glutathione, high-density lipoprotein, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Treatment significantly counteracted the effects of L Name. The mixture provides a promising natural cardiovascular regulating supplement owing to its high contents of flavonoids."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) experience high levels of anxiety that may cause instability of hemodynamic indices, increased risk of ischemia, myocardial infarction and poor quality of life. Aromatherapy can affect patients' anxiety levels and improve hemodynamic indices. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of aromatherapy on anxiety and hemodynamic indices in ACS patients. METHODS: This study was a double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted on 154 ACS patients. The participants were classified into two equal groups of intervention and placebo through the block randomization method. The data collection tools consisted of demographic information, a shortened 6-item version of the Spielberger questionnaire and a form of hemodynamic indices. For two consecutive nights, the intervention group inhaled 7 drops of the chamomile essential oil (%10) and the placebo group inhaled 7 drops of the sesame oil poured on a sterile cotton ball. The hemodynamic indices were collected half an hour before, one and four hours after the intervention until the next morning. The Spielberger questionnaire was completed once before the intervention and once after the end of the intervention, by the researcher through an interview. The number of heart rate (HR) was counted for a full minute. Also, the blood pressure (BP) of all the samples was measured by the researcher. Data analysis was done using Chi-square, paired t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS22. RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation of the age of patients were 58/2 ± 11.6 and 59.7% of them were female. The results of ANOVA showed a significantly lower anxiety score as well as systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and HR in the intervention group compared to those of the placebo group (P < 0.001). The decrease in anxiety score after the intervention, in the intervention and placebo groups was (5.2 ± 1.9) and (1 ± 1. 18) respectively. In the intervention group, the SBP and DBP after the intervention, was significant (P < 0.05). Also, the HR was significant (P < 0.001) after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Aromatherapy could reduce anxiety and improve hemodynamic indices in ACS patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT20080825001083N11.",

Homeopathic drops containing chamomile extract are often used for ear pain and chronic ear infections. We aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of over-the-counter eardrops containing chamomile against organisms causing bacterial conjunctivitis and otitis externa. Liquid cultures of Streptococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were exposed to increasing concentrations of eardrops containing chamomile extract. Liquid cultures of S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were exposed to increasing concentrations of chamomile eye drops for 5, 10, 15, and 45 min. Colony forming units (CFUs) were assessed after 18 h. Viability assays for these organisms were performed using the resazurin microdilution assay. We observed a reduction in the number of P. aeruginosa CFUs when the bacteria were exposed to any of the three concentrations of the chamomile drops as early as 5 min, with maximal reduction upon exposure to the 30% concentration at 45 min. Reduction in S. aureus CFUs, on the other hand, was observed for all three concentrations as maximal in the 5 min of exposure. We observed a marked reduction in the number of S. aureus CFUs upon exposure to any of the three preparations of chamomile-containing eye drops, which was almost immediate at 10% concentration. Streptococcus pneumoniae reduction happened at 5 min and continued through the 45-min observation period for all three concentrations. Our findings suggest that over-the-counter ear drops containing chamomile extract could potentially be used as a non-prescription treatment for mild cases of otitis externa and bacterial conjunctivitis.",

This study aimed to determine the effect of mint extract and chamomile drops on the GRV of trauma patients under mechanical ventilation and nasogastric tube feeding in the intensive care unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a triple-blinded randomized clinical trial with a 2×2 crossover design. Eighty patients were randomly divided to receive mint extract and chamomile drops. Five drops of mint extract and 11 drops of chamomile were gavaged every 6 hr. GRV was measured using a syringe-aspiration method before and 3 hr after each intervention. After a 24-hour washout period, the two groups changed places. RESULTS: In the first phase of the study, before the interventions, the GRV in the mint and chamomile groups was 14.60±7.89 and 13.79±7.12 ml, and after the interventions were 8.13±6.31 and 6.61±4.68 ml, respectively. In the study's second phase, before the interventions, the GRV in the mint and chamomile groups was 10.03±4.93 and 11.46±7.17 ml and after the interventions, GRV was 4.97±4.05 and 6.98±4.60 ml, respectively. The difference in the GRV before and after the intervention was not significantly different between the two groups. Both herbal drugs effectively reduced the GRV (p=0.382). CONCLUSION: Mint extract and chamomile drops are similarly effective in reducing the GRV in trauma patients under mechanical ventilation and nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding in the intensive care unit."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chamomile is consumed worldwide for enjoyment and its potentially desirable properties. Widespread patient resource websites, however, discourage preoperative chamomile intake, lest bleeding could worsen. This precaution, though, stems largely from indirect evidence in one case report. To evaluate if chamomile ingestion impacts coagulation assays via coumarin-like substances, we designed a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy volunteers were randomized to three interventions in a cross-over-design spanning 5 weeks per subject. Interventions included 7-day consumption of chamomile tea (3 tea bags × 3 times daily = 9 tea bags daily), a chamomile extract capsule (3 times daily), or a placebo capsule (3 times daily). A 7-day washout period elapsed between intervention periods. The primary outcome was the change in prothrombin time (PT) before vs. after each intervention. Secondary outcomes included changes in the international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), reptilase time (RT), and fibrinogen (FG) surrounding each intervention. RESULTS: All 12 enrolled subjects were randomized and completed the study. The primary outcome of PT change (mean ± SD) was similar across interventions (chamomile tea =  - 0.2 ± 0.4 s, extract capsule =  - 0.2 ± 0.4 s, and placebo capsule = 0.1 ± 0.5 s; p = 0.34). INR change was 0 s (p = 0.07) for each intervention. The aPTT, TT, RT, and FG, did not change significantly across interventions (p = 0.8, p = 0.08, p = 0.8, and p = 0.2 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Chamomile intake by tea or capsule does not prolong PT. These findings challenge the notion to avoid perioperative chamomile intake in patients not taking warfarin.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of chamomile on oligomenorrhea and hirsutism symptoms as well as hormonal parameters among patients suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study is a randomized clinical trial performed on 70 patients with diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome according to Rotterdam criteria referring to the infertility clinic of a university hospital. The patients were randomly assigned into intervention and control groups, with the former receiving two chamomile capsules 500 mg for three months, and the latter receiving two placebo capsules for 3 months. Both groups were evaluated in terms of laboratory parameters (FBS, LDL, and testosterone) on the third day of first and third cycles. The collected data were analyzed by SPSS 20. RESULTS: The mean age, body mass index, marital status, history of infertility, and pregnancy rate showed no significant difference between the two groups. In the chamomile group, clinical symptoms of hirsutism (p<0.001) and oligomenorrhea (p=0.048) decreased following the treatment, but significant difference was found between the two groups only in hirsutism symptoms (p=0.028). Regarding the parameters of FBS (p=0.06), HDL (p=0.224), cholesterol (p=0.99), triglyceride (p=0.106), testosterone (p=0.894), and LDL (p=0.61), no significant difference was observed between the two groups. Nevertheless, following the treatment, testosterone decreased in both placebo (p=0.005) and chamomile (p=0.001) groups. CONCLUSION: overall, the chamomile therapeutic regimen has relatively been able to mitigate the clinical symptoms and testosterone levels in patients suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome. Use of chamomile plant as a simple, inexpensive, and effective measure can be suggested for improving and treating patients with PCOS after confirmation by further studies."

A total of 450 male and female 42-day-old chickens were allocated to a completely randomized design with five treatment groups and two sexes in six replicates, 12 birds (six male and six female) for each replicate. Treatment groups were chickens offered ad libitum feed and drinking water (control, CT), broilers exposed to FW for 10 h before the slaughter with unsupplemented drinking water (FW), with drinking water supplemented 50 ml/L CAE, LAE, and GAE. Chickens that experienced FW had lower (P < 0.001) slaughter body weight, carcass, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and inner organ weights, and GIT length (P = 0.002). However, the dressing percentage was higher (P < 0.001) in FW and AE groups than CT group. The FW increased (P < 0.001) the ultimate pH of thigh meat compared with the CT group. The FW also decreased (P = 0.026) the lightness (L*) value of thigh meat of broilers, although CAE and LAE did not change the L* value compared with the CT group. Similarly, the redness (a*) value of thigh meat was lower (P = 0.003) in chickens exposed to FW but was not affected by GAE administration. However, FW or AE did not impact the serum corticosterone level and cecal microbial loads in broiler chickens.

There are various kinds of therapeutic methods used for their treatment though sometimes their effects are limited. Thus, it is essential to find alternative treatments to decrease the implications of the disease. The present study is aimed to investigate the effect of Chamomilla recutita on flatulence after Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was carried out in 2020 at Isfahan in Iran. Patients randomly fell into either chamomile (n = 32) or placebo groups (n = 32). The intervention was performed 1 h before the operation. The severity and the frequency of flatulence were recorded using a visual analog scale in both groups in three stages before the operation, after the operation in recovery, and 2 h after the operation. RESULTS: The flatulence was not observed before the operation and on arrival in the recovery room. Before leaving the recovery room, the frequency of flatulence was the same in both the groups. However, in the surgical ward, the frequency of flatulence in the chamomile group was significantly lower than in the placebo group. The mean of flatulence severity has significantly increased in both groups over time but in the chamomile group, this increase was significantly lower than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that chamomile has a potential therapeutic effect on the gastrointestinal and can reduce flatulence. In laparoscopic surgeries, using chamomile drops as a preventive drug seems to be effective in reducing the incidence of postoperative flatulence."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain is the most common side effect in cesarean section with spinal anesthesia. It seems that oxygen therapy and chamomile aromatherapy may diminish pain. The present study was conducted to examine and compare the effect of chamomile aromatherapy with and without oxygen on the severity of pain of women following cesarean section surgery with spinal anesthesia. METHODS: The present randomized clinical trial study was carried out on 136 women undergoing cesarean section surgery with spinal anesthesia at Imam Sajad Hospital, Yasuj, Iran in 2020. The eligible women were assigned into four 34-member groups including oxygen therapy plus aromatherapy, oxygen therapy, aromatherapy, and control via block randomization. Each of these interventions were performed 6, 6.30 and 7 h post operation. In the first intervention group, one drop of chamomile essential oil with distilled water was poured into a small nebulizer using a simple mask connected to 6 L of oxygen. The second intervention group received oxygen without chamomile aromatherapy at similar times, and the third intervention group received chamomile aromatherapy without oxygen. The control group received only routine interventions. The instrument used in the research was visual analog scale which was completed by the researcher 6, 12, 18 h after cesarean section. The data were analyzed by the SPSS software version 20. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the intensity of pain of patients between the various groups of study following the interventions (P < 0.001). Pain intensity reduced significantly in the group receiving combined intervention of chamomile aromatherapy plus oxygen compared to the other three groups. Moreover, the pain intensity diminished more in the groups undergoing each of these interventions alone as compared to the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The combined intervention of chamomile aromatherapy with oxygen was more effective than each of the chamomile aromatherapy and oxygen interventions alone in reducing the pain of cesarean section patients though each intervention alone was still effective in lowering pain post-operation."

Chamomile as an herbal medicine has gained an increasing attention for relieving cancer complications. This study aimed to integrate and synthesize current international evidence regarding the effect of chamomile on cancer complications. METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken. Five online databases including Web of Science, PubMed [including MEDLINE], Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Embase were searched and articles published from inception to January 2023 were retrieved. All clinical trials and similar interventional studies on human subjects examining the effects of chamomile on cancer complications were included in the review and research synthesis. Relevant data were extracted from eligible studies after quality appraisals using proper methodological tools. The review results were presented narratively given that meta-analysis was impossible. RESULTS: A total of 2240 studies were retrieved during the search process, but 18 articles were selected. The total sample size was 1099 patients with cancer of which 622 participants were female. Fifteen studies used an RCT design. Various forms of chamomile were used such as mouthwash, topical material, tea, capsule, syrup and aromatherapy massage. Chamomile effectively reduced oral mucositis, skin complications, depression, and vomiting and also improved appetite and quality of life among cancer patients. CONCLUSION: The use of chamomile as a non-pharmacologic and safe method can be helpful for mitigating cancer complications in patients with cancer. Therefore, it can be incorporated into routine care along with other therapeutic measures to reduce patients' suffering related to cancer.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the novel mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is low-grade chronic inflammation. Chamomile (Matricaria recutita L.) and Nettle (Urtica dioica), with phytoestrogenic and antioxidant properties, are traditionally used to treat gynecological diseases. This study investigated the immune-modulating effects of these two plants. METHODS: Following the induction of PCOS by subcutaneous injection (SC) of Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in BALB / C mice. Mice were treated in five groups: Sham, PCOS, PCOS + Chamomile, PCOS + Nettle, and PCOS + Chamomile and Nettle for 21 days. Ovarian morphology, blood antioxidant capacity, the abundance of Treg cells, and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß), cyclooxygenase-2 genes (COX-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were measured. RESULTS: Folliculogenesis, Cystic follicles, and corpus luteum improved in the treatment groups (P < 0. 05). Treg cells in the DHEA group were significantly reduced compared to the Sham group (P < 0. 01). However, this decrease was not corrected in treatment groups (P > 0. 05). Total serum antioxidant capacity was significantly increased in the treatment group of Nettle and Chamomile + Nettle (P < 0. 05). The expression of MMP9 and TGFβ genes in the PCOS group was significantly higher than the Sham group (P < 0. 05), which the expression of MMP9 was corrected by treatment with Chamomile + Nettle extract (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Chamomile and Nettle extract may be an effective supplement in improving the histological and immunological changes of PCOS. However, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in humans.",

The chemical constituents and its antitumor activity on Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was explored in the present study. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was employed to analyze the chemical constituents of CEO. The cell viability, migration and invasion of TNBC cell MDA-MB-231 were measured using MTT, wound scratch and Transwell assay, respectively. The protein expression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was determined by Western blot. CEO is rich in terpenoids (63.51 %), among which the identified terpenoids and their derivatives are mainly Caryophyllene (29.57 %), d-Cadinene (12.81 %), Caryophyllene oxide (14.51 %), etc. Three concentration of CEO (1, 1.5, 2 μg/mL) significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells with a dose dependent manner. Moreover, the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt and mTOR was inhibited by CEO. The results revealed that there was abundant terpenoids in the CEO which account for 63.51 %. CEO significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, exhibiting antitumor effect on TNBC. The antitumor effect of CEO might attribute to its inhibition on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. However, further study should be conducted in more TNBC cell lines and animal models to provide further evidence for TNBC treatment by CEO.",

Various medicinal plants are used for the treatment and management of various cancers. Matricaria chamomilla L., is one of the extensively used Unani medicament for the treatment of various type of diseases. In the current study we evaluated most of the parameters prescribed for drug standardization using pharmacognostic approaches. The 2,2 Diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) method was utilized for the analysis of antioxidant activity in the flower extracts of M. chamomilla. Moreover, we analyzed the antioxidant and cytotoxic activity of M. chamomilla (Gul-e Babuna) through in-vitro method. DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazl-hydrate) method was utilized for the analysis of antioxidant activity in the flower extracts of M. chamomilla. CFU and wound healing assay were performed to determine the anti-cancer activity. The results demonstrated that various extracts of M. chamomilla fulfilled most of the parameters of drug standardization and contained good antioxidant and anticancer activities. The ethyl acetate showed higher anticancer activity followed by aqueous, hydroalcoholic, petroleum benzene and methanol by CFU method. Also, the wound healing assay demonstrated that ethyl acetate extract has more significant effect followed by methanol and petroleum benzene extract on prostate cancer cell line (C4-2). The current study concluded that the extract of M. chamomilla flowers could act as good source of natural anti-cancer compounds."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders. IBS is characterized by recurrent chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of organic damage. Although there are reviews and guidelines for treating IBS, the complexity and diversity of IBS presentation make treatment difficult. Treatment of IBS focuses on relieving symptoms as mild signs and symptoms can often be controlled by managing stress and by making changes in diet and lifestyle. The use of nutraceutical compounds has been advocated as a possible alternative treatment in patients with IBS. COLONIR® (Omega Pharma Srl, Milan, Italy) may be an alternative or adjuvant treatment in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of this new nutraceutical formulation in inducing symptoms remission and improve gastrointestinal habits. METHODS: An initial cohort of 1004 consecutive patients referred to 25 different Units of Internal Medicine a/o Gastroenterology in Italy to perform colonoscopy for intestinal symptoms was asked to participate. Patients were treated for 2 months with two doses of nutraceuticals/day during meals namely COLONIR®. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2 months to evaluate the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms in the past seven days with a questionnaire based on ROMA IV criteria. RESULTS: After 2 months, 899 patients completed the follow-up. COLONIR® achieved a statistically significant reduction of severity of symptoms in the study population without any documented side effects. CONCLUSIONS: These promising results, here reported, need to be confirmed, valuating the efficacy of COLONIR® in relieving gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients in further studies.",

Mast cells seem to play a key role in the symptom generation of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). To evaluate the use of the TMP in IBS treatment, the effects of the herbal extracts on the release of mast-cell mediators from stimulated RBL-2H3 cells were investigated. Therefore, degranulation was induced by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and calcium ionophore A13187 (CI) or IgE stimulation, and the amounts of released β-hexosaminidase and histamine were quantified. The extracts showed no effect on the mediator release of PMA- and CI-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. Myrrh and chamomile were able to reduce the β-hexosaminidase release of IgE-stimulated cells, while myrrh showed stronger inhibition of the mediator release than chamomile, which reduced only IgE-stimulated histamine release. Thus, these results indicate a mechanistic basis for the use of the herbal combination of myrrh, coffee charcoal, and chamomile flower extract in the symptom-oriented treatment of IBS patients with diarrheal symptoms."

      "abstract": "Giardia intestinalis (syn. G. lamblia, G. duodenalis) is a protozoa parasite that produces one of the most frequent waterborne causes of diarrhea worldwide. This protozoan infects most mammals, including humans, and colonizes the small intestine, adhering to intestinal cells. The mechanism by which G. intestinalis causes diarrhea is multifactorial, causing intestinal malabsorption. The treatment of giardiasis uses chemotherapeutic drugs such as nitroimidazoles, furazolidone, paromomycin, and benzimidazole compounds. However, they are toxic, refractory, and may generate resistance. To increase efficacy, a current treatment strategy is to combine these drugs with other compounds, such as polysaccharides. Several studies have shown that polysaccharides have gastroprotective effects. Polysaccharides are high-molecular weight polymers, and they differ in structure and functions, being widely extracted from vegetables and fruits. In the present study, we show that polysaccharides found in chamomile tea (called MRW), in contact with antiparasitic agents, potentially inhibit the adhesion of parasites to intestinal cells. Moreover, at 500 µg/mL, they act synergistically with nitazoxanide (NTZ), increasing its effectiveness and decreasing the drug dose needed for giardiasis treatment."

In the two intervention groups, Swedish massage techniques (i.e., Effleurage, Petrissage, Vibration, and Superficial stroke) were performed with and without the use of chamomile oil since the active phase of labor (5 cm dilatation), while the control group received only routine labor care during labor. RESULTS: Swedish massage with chamomile oil significantly reduced the labor pain score, reduced the length of active phase and the second stage of labor, and increased the score of maternal satisfaction with the labor process (P < 0.001). In addition, there was a significant relationship between the type of study groups and the type of delivery (P < 0.043). CONCLUSION: The results of the study showed that using Swedish massage techniques with or without chamomile oil can improve labor outcomes. Swedish massage using chamomile oil was associated with better results compared to the same massage without using chamomile oil. Clinical trial code IRCT20200513047430N1.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder with an increasing prevalence worldwide. Reduction in blood insulin level alters brain function by inducing oxidative stress with changes in dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission, ultimately leading to neuropsychological symptoms. The efficacy of currently available psychotropic drugs is not satisfactory. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the beneficial effects of a combination of the natural herbs, saffron and chamomile, in treating diabetes and its resultant neuropsychological effects using a rodent model of diabetes mellitus. METHOD: The rats were randomly divided in to eight groups (n = 10), healthy control (HC), diabetic control (DC) and six groups of diabetic rats treated with various concentrations and combinations of saffron and chamomile. Diabetic treatment groups individually received methanolic extract and water decoction of chamomile (30 mg/kg) and saffron (10mg/kg) and their combined half doses (saffron 5mg/kg and chamomile 15mg/kg) for two weeks. Open field test (OFT) and forced swim test (FST) were used to measure the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of herbs, respectively. Finally, biochemical, and neurochemical estimations were made. RESULTS: The present study suggests the therapeutic effects of herbs especially in co-administrated decoction, against diabetes with improved antioxidant profile and enhanced levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Anxiolytic and antidepressant effects were evident with improvements in the OFT and FST. Examination of the cortex of the diabetic group revealed cellular damage and tangle formation, which indicates advanced stages of dementia. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the use of a combination of saffron and chamomile improves diabetes control and reduces its related psychiatric effects.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the common psychiatric problems in growing world population caused by long-term stressful events that may trigger the down regulation of neurogenesis. The pathogenesis of depression initially relies on serotonin deficiency which is associated with depressive feelings. Tryptophan (TRP) depletion participate crucial role in inducing depressive symptoms. Long-term reduction of 5-HT may disseminate to high sensitivity of MDD and alters the level of BDNF. Some studies have also revealed the strong association between excessive neuroinflammation and BDNF levels, due the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The treatment approach through FDA approved medicine has their own merits and drawbacks. Therefore, herbal alternatives have recently garnered attention for their effectiveness against depression. However, evidence-based synergic effects of antidepressant with different herbal agents are limited. The purpose of this study was to assess the synergistic effects of two well-known herbs, chamomile and saffron, as an adjuvant therapy in patients with mild to moderate depression. The present study was study randomized, open, blinded trial and comprised of 120 participants randomly allocated to control (n = 60) and test (n = 60). After consent, the patient health questionnaire- 9 (PHQ-9) was filled to obtain depression scores. The test participants were received herbal tea sachets twice a day for one month (20 mg Chamomile and 1 mg Saffron/sachet) along with routine medicines, while control participants were received only allopathic medications. Blood samples were taken before and after the treatment. The depressive symptoms improved significantly with both treatments. The effect of herbs enhanced the efficacy of medications and significantly improved PHQ-9 scale and BDNF while reduced the inflammatory markers (CRP) and TRP level in plasma thereby increased the availability of TRP in brain. It has been concluded that the herbal adjuvant therapy produced long term improvement against depression and enhanced the efficacy of allopathic treatment."

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous disease with numerous abnormal targets and pathways involved in insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation, oxidative stress, beta cell dysfunction, and epigenetic factors. Botanical drugs provide a large chemical space that can modify various targets simultaneously. Matricaria aurea (MA, golden chamomile) is a widely used herb in Middle Eastern communities for many ailments, including diabetes mellitus, without any scientific basis to support this tradition. For the first time, this study aimed to investigate the possible antidiabetic activity of MA in a type 2 diabetic rat model, identify chemical constituents by LC-MS/MS, and then elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) using enzyme activity assays, q-RTPCR gene expression analysis, network pharmacology analysis, and molecular docking simulation. Our results demonstrated that only the polar hydroethanolic extract of MA had remarkable antidiabetic activity. Furthermore, it improved dyslipidemia, insulin resistance status, ALT, and AST levels. LC-MS/MS analysis of MA hydroethanolic extract identified 62 compounds, including the popular chamomile flavonoids apigenin and luteolin, other flavonoids and their glycosides, coumarin derivatives, and phenolic acids. Based on pharmacokinetic screening and literature, 46 compounds were chosen for subsequent network analysis, which linked to 364 candidate T2DM targets from various databases and literature. The network analysis identified 123 hub proteins, including insulin signaling and metabolic proteins: IRS1, IRS2, PIK3R1, AKT1, AKT2, MAPK1, MAPK3, and PCK1, inflammatory proteins: TNF and IL1B, antioxidant enzymes: CAT and SOD, and others. Subsequent filtering identified 40 crucial core targets (major hubs) of MA in T2DM treatment. Functional enrichment analyses of the candidate targets revealed that MA targets were mainly involved in the inflammatory module, energy-sensing/endocrine/metabolic module, and oxidative stress module. q-RTPCR gene expression analysis showed that MA hydroethanolic extract was able to significantly upregulate PIK3R1 and downregulate IL1B, PCK1, and MIR29A. Moreover, the activity of the antioxidant hub enzymes was substantially increased. Molecular docking scores were also consistent with the networks' predictions. Based on experimental and computational analysis, this study revealed for the first time that MA exerted antidiabetic action via simultaneous modulation of multiple targets and pathways, including inflammatory pathways, energy-sensing/endocrine/metabolic pathways, and oxidative stress pathways."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health condition, and anxiety is considered the sixth cause of disability surpassing diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis. Besides, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an increase in the number of psychiatric diseases diagnosis in all social layers around the world. About 55%-94% of patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders are treated with benzodiazepines, meanwhile benzodiazepines can promote several adverse effects. In this way, alternative therapies, such as essential oils may offer significant benefits in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders. However, the anxiolytic effect of these essential oils must be proper evaluated appropriate as well as the suitable dosage and side effect need further research. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim was to evaluate the anxiolytic effect of Roman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis L.) and tangerine (Citrus reticulata Blanco) essential oils using the light-dark test in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Both essential oils were analyzed by GC-MS and the major compounds were identified. The anxiolytic effect was evaluated by light-dark test in adult zebrafish. RESULTS: The results showed that roman chamomile essential oil has anxiolytic effect in adult zebrafish, whereas tangerine essential oil tends to reduce anxiety The major compounds of tangerine essential oil were limonene and γ-terpinene, and the major compounds of roman chamomile were pentadecyl-3-methyl-2-butenoate, hexadecyl-3-methyl-2-butenoate, 1-piperidinol and trans-1-ethyl-3-methyl-cyclopentane. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that this anxiolytic effect may be attributed to the synergistic effect of the compounds present in roman chamomile essential oil, particularly the major compounds. The roman chamomile essential oil at the highest concentration showed anxiolytic effect. The tangerine essential oil showed a tendency to reduce anxiety, but it was not statistically significative. In addition, roman chamomile and tangerine essential oils did not cause cause alteration in locomotion activity and exploratory ability of the fish.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a common complaint among postmenopausal women, which is largely because of the genitourinary syndrome in these women (GSM). AIM: Considering the phytoestrogenic effects of chamomile, the present study was primarily aimed to investigate the effect of chamomile vaginal gel on the sexual function of postmenopausal women. The side effects of these drugs were evaluated as a secondary outcome of the study. METHODS: This randomized double-blind clinical trial and placebo-controlled study was conducted on postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction (FSFI ≤26.55). To this aim, 96 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 32 each) including women receiving (i) chamomile vaginal gel 5%, (ii) conjugated estrogen vaginal cream, and (iii) placebo vaginal gel, for 12 weeks (ie, every night in the first 2 weeks, and 2 nights per week in the next 10 weeks, each night 1 g was used). The sexual function was measured using female sexual function index (FSFI) before and after the intervention. Data analysis was performed by chi-square, one-way ANOVA, descriptive statistics, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and paired t test using SPSS software version 22. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. OUTCOMES: The main study outcome measure was evaluate the effects of vaginal administration of chamomile gel in comparison with conjugated estrogen cream and placebo gel on postmenopausal FSD using the FSFI. RESULTS: The findings showed that chamomile vaginal gel in compared to placebo vaginal gel caused a significant improvement in all six sexual function domains and the total FSFI score (effect size = +2.9 [95% CI, +2.1 to +3.6], P < .001). Also, there was no significant difference between the chamomile vaginal gel and conjugated estrogen vaginal cream groups in terms of the total score and all sub-domains of sexual function with the exception of orgasm (effect size = +0.13 [95% CI, -0.36 to +0.63], P = .02) and sexual satisfaction (effect size = 0 [95% CI, -0.49 to +0.49], P = .04). Two women in the chamomile group and one in the placebo group experienced a burning sensation (P = .345). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This treatment can be considered as a treatment option for postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction who have contraindications to the use of hormone therapy. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: This study is the first study to investigate the effectiveness of chamomile vaginal gel on sexual function in postmenopausal women. However, in this study, treatment duration was 12 weeks and no follow up was performed beyond this time CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, the use of vaginal chamomile gel improved sexual function in postmenopausal women.

METHODS: A double-blinded, controlled, randomized, phase II clinical trial developed with women diagnosed with breast cancer who will receive radiation therapy. The participants were randomly divided into 2 groups: control and treatment. They were followed up until the end of the treatment or the appearance of grade III RD. RESULTS: Fifty-four women were included in the study. There is no significant difference between the groups in the incidence (88.9% vs. 88.9%, P=1.0) or time to develop any grade of RD (3 days of difference, P=0.300). A significant reduction was observed in the incidence (P=0.03) and in the time to appearance (7 d of difference, P=0.01) grade 2 or >RD. In the follow-up evaluation (15 d after the end of treatment), the Chamomile group presented a superior skin recovery than the control group (P=0.0343). High-intensity local symptoms as pain, and pruritus were significantly reduced in the Chamomile group. CONCLUSIONS: Although no effect was observed with chamomile to reduce any grade of RD, it was effective to reduce grade 2 or >toxicity, to improve skin recovery and to diminish high-intensity local symptoms.

Rats were divided in two control groups (untreated control and treated control) and two diabetic groups (untreated diabetic and treated diabetic). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) activities, total antioxidant status (TAS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were determined. The chemical composition of the chamomile essential oil revealed 39 compounds, accounting for 93.5% of the total oils. The polyphenolic profile of the tea showed the presence of apigenin, luteolin, umbelliferone, and esculetin. SOD, GPx, CAT, and TAS levels were lower in the parotid (PA) diabetic glands, but treatment increased their concentration in both the submandibular (SM) and PA diabetic salivary glands. Increased MDA levels were observed in the PA diabetic glands, which were decreased by the consumption of chamomile tea with a reduction in hyperglycemia compared to that in untreated diabetic rats. However, the SM diabetic glands showed no difference in the MDA content. The consumption of chamomile tea prevented oxidative stress in the PA glands of diabetic rats, exhibiting hypoglycemic and antioxidant effects. Thus, chamomile tea could be a potential candidate for preventing oral complications in diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "Matricaria aurea (Loefl.) Schultz Bip. (Asteraceae), known as golden chamomile, has been traditionally used for the treatment of various diseases. In this study, total phenolic, flavonoid, and tannin contents of total extract and different fractions of this plant were determined. The antioxidant, cytotoxic, and antimicrobial activities were also evaluated. Moreover, the phenolic profiles of selected fractions were determined by HPLC and LC-MS/MS analysis. Results demonstrated total phenolic contents of 37.8-57.2 mg GAE/g and total flavonoid contents of 3.0-111.2 mg QE/g. The ethyl acetate and methanol fractions (EF and MF) had the highest concentrations of phenolic, tannin, and flavonoid compounds. In both DPPH radical scavenging assay and phosphomolybdenum reduction assay, EF showed the best antioxidant activity, followed by MF. EF and MF indicated also the best antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis (MIC 1.56 and 12.5 mg ml-1) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 0.78 and 12.5 mg ml-1). Hexane fraction (HF) had no antibacterial effect. None of the samples had antifungal effect. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay revealed for EF and HF the highest antiproliferative activities (IC50 values ranged from 111.8 to 294.6 μg ml-1). The presence of chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, and luteolin-7-O-glucoside in MF, and p-coumaric acid in EF was confirmed and quantified.",

After all the steps, six articles were selected. The total sample included 492 patients and all studies used the same OM measurement scale. The results showed that the application of topical chamomile was effective in the prevention and/or treatment of OM in four of the six studies, with a dose ranging from 1% to 2.5% and duration that ranged from single to 4 times a day. Some limitations were observed: the minimum age of the patients was not informed, and there was no specification of the sites involved or the chemotherapies used. The application of topical chamomile in the preventive/therapeutic of chemo-induced OM seems to be recommended. In addition, scientific production should be encouraged, as it aims to determine useful protocols for this phytotherapy for the oncology population.",

METHODS: This prospective study included 72 PE patients treated by application of CCLH to the glans and penile body in our hospital from February to October 2021. According to the time of drug administration before insertion into the vagina, we randomly divided the patients into a 5-minute group (n = 39) and a 15-minute group (n = 33). Before and after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment, we compared the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), PE diagnostic tool (PEDT) score, quality of life, and adverse reactions between the two groups of patients. RESULTS: Totally 62 of the patients completed the follow-up, 35 in the 5-minute group and 27 in the 15-minute group, and all showed significant improvement in IELT (P < 0.01) and PEDT score (P < 0.05) after treatment compared with the baseline. No allergic reactions, such as redness and swelling, developed at the application site in any of the patients, and no adverse significant effect was observed on the erectile hardness in 61 of the cases. Six cases showed increased erectile hardness instead. Fifty-seven of the patients experienced no obvious penile numbness or reduced sexual satisfaction, and all could complete their sexual activities. CONCLUSION: Compound Chamomile and Lidocaine Hydrochloride Gel applied at different time-windows is effective on PE, with a 5-minute rapid onset of action before intercourse, and no obvious adverse effects.",

After two weeks of treatment with the same criteria, cheese-like vaginal discharge, itching and burning sensations, strawberry cervix, and recovery percentage was evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty patients in each group were analyzed. There was no significant difference in age and number of pregnancies between groups (p = 0.85 and 0.09, respectively). Comparing before and after treatment, cheese like discharge (p < 0.001), itching (p < 0.001), burning (p < 0.001) had significantly improved in both groups. Further, the recovery percentage was not significantly different between groups (88.9% vs 75% in the chamomile vs clotrimazole groups, respectively). CONCLUSION: Chamomile is as effective as clotrimazole in VVC treatment; a higher percentage of women who used this medication recovered, although this did not reach significance. In addition, no complications were reported in either group."

STUDY DESIGN: This clinical trial study was performed on 118 students of Guilan University of Medical Sciences. Participants were divided into two groups of chamomile and placebo. Both groups received one capsule every 8 h for 7 days before the onset of menstrual bleeding. The data collection tool was a Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST). Data analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney, independent t-test, Wilcoxon, and analysis of covariance. RESULTS: According to the results of the Mann-Whitney test Chamomile capsules were more effective than placebo in reducing menstrual-related mood disorders (p < 0/001). The results of the analysis of covariance showed that after controlling the associated variables, the changes in the severity of mood symptoms between the two groups were significantly different (p < 0/05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that the use of chamomile capsules can be an effective treatment in alleviating emotional symptoms related to menstrual cycles."

Through the new network pharmacology method, we found that German chamomile volatile oil regulated T-cell lymphatic subpopulations to inhibit the Th17 cell differentiation signaling pathway. This resulted in a reduction of interleukin 17 (IL-17), thereby inhibiting the activation of the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and MAPK pathways, decreasing the secretion of the pro-inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6)), and reducing inflammation. In this study, a new dose-effect relationship synergistic network pharmacology method was established to provide a new method for the screening of effective ingredients and pathways of drugs, and to provide a basis for the follow-up studies of German chamomile volatile oil in the treatment of eczema."

METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active control, multicenter clinical trial included patients with seborrheic blepharitis using block randomization (BS, n=23; swabs, n=26). Patients were treated with BS or swabs for 8 weeks followed by 4 weeks of treatment withdrawal. Change in Blepharitis Symptom measure (BLISS), Demodex count, Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score, Schirmer test, tear breakup time (TBUT), noninvasive TBUT (NI-TBUT), corneal staining, and meibography at different visits (baseline, fourth, , and 12th week) were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Patients in both groups showed similar baseline parameters (P>0.05). Patients using swabs showed significantly lower BLISS scores compared with patients using BS at the 4th, 8th, and 12th week visits (3.6±6.1 vs. 6.3±4.5 P=0.011; 1.1±2.8 vs. 6.6±6.7, P<0.001; 0.9±2.8 vs. 5.7±6.6, P=0.002, respectively). Patients using swabs showed improvement in OSDI scores after 8 weeks of treatment compared with the baseline visit (P<0.001). Despite a similar Demodex reduction effect in both treatment arms even after 4 weeks of treatment (P<0.001), both treatment modalities did not show any effect on the other parameters. CONCLUSION: Although both swabs and BS showed efficacy for the treatment of seborrheic blepharitis in terms of the Demodex reduction and symptomatic improvement, swabs may provide better symptomatic improvement. Four weeks of treatment discontinuation may not cause any recurrence in the symptoms or Demodex infestation.",

It is a common problem among females in their reproductive age which is caused by increased production of prostaglandin in the endometrium as one of leading causes. Chamomile extract ceases the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The aim of this study was to systematically review the clinical trials to determine the effect of Chamomile on pain and menstural bleeding in primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS: Search process to find relevant articles was conducted on electronic Iranian (MagIran, SID) and international databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, ProQuest, Cochrane library, Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCO), using English keywords and Persian equivalents such a \"Dysmenorrhea\", \"Pain\", \"Menstrual bleeding\" and \"Chamomil\" without a time limit until March 2020. Irrelevant, duplicate, descriptive, or qualitative studies were excluded. To evaluate the quality of articles, we used the Cochran's Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Among124 articles found in the initial search, finally 7 clinical trials (with a sample size of 1033) were systematically examined. Two out of 7 studies examined the effect of Chamomile on the pain of primary dysmenorrhea, 2 studies on the effect of Chamomile on menstrual bleeding volume, and 3 on the effect of Chamomileon pain and menstural bleeding in primary dysmenorrhea. CONCLUSION: Based on results of the most reviewed studies, Chamomile can be considered as an effective treatment for primary dysmenorrhea and reducing menstrual bleeding."

METHODS: The study included 123 patients. Based on Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma guidelines, mometasone furoate intranasal spray treatment was started for all patients in the group diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. In addition to this treatment, isotonic seawater spray with chamomile liquid extract was added to Group A, isotonic seawater spray to Group B, and isotonic seawater nasal irrigation to Group C. The fourth group (Group D) was given only nasal steroid spray without nasal washing treatment. Before and after treatment in all patients, the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 was performed, and nasal mucociliary clearance times were measured by the saccharin test. RESULTS: The differences in duration of nasal mucociliary clearance and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 values were taken before and after treatment. In Group A, B, C, and D the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 differences were statistically significant (P ≤.001; P ≤ .001; P ≤ .001, and P = .048, respectively). Only Group A and Group B experienced a significant difference in nasal mucociliary clearance times (P ≤ .001; P = .010, respectively). When the Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 score and nasal mucociliary clearance time differences before and after treatment were compared between all groups, the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 score difference was higher in Group A than in Groups B, C, and D, the differences were found as statistically significant (P = .010; P = .003; P ≤ .001, respectively). The nasal mucociliary clearance time difference was higher in Group A than in Groups C and D, the differences were found as statistically significant (P = .010; P = .001, respectively).

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of dietary supplementation with a mixture of dried oregano, thyme, sideritis tea and chamomile on laying hen performance, egg quality parameters, and oxidative stability in the egg yolk were monitored. METHODS: In this trial 432 hens were allocated in two treatments (unsupplemented vs. supplemented with the mixture) and fed for 42 days. Eggs were collected at the end of the trial period, egg yolk was separated, extracted, and the total phenolic content (TPC) and oxidative stability was measured. Furthermore, LC-MS metabolic profile of eggs was studied and pathway analysis was elaborated in MetaboAnalyst to facilitate annotation of features. RESULTS: Overall, egg production and feed conversion ratio were not affected by the supplementation. However, eggs from the supplemented treatment showed improved shell thickness and strength, and yolk resistance to oxidation. Moreover, LC-MS metabolomic analysis of egg yolk of supplemented and unsupplemented layers showed significant variations and tight clustering in unsupervised principal component analysis due to different chemical profiling of egg yolk. LC-MS study showed that secondary metabolites of aromatic plants did not transfer into yolk, nevertheless the feed supplementation impacted the pathway metabolism of tyrosine, phenylalanine, propanate, and the biosynthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary supplementation of layers with a mixture of dried medicinal aromatic plants affected shell thickness and strength, the lipid and protein oxidative stability and increased tyrosine and phenylalanine content in eggs.",

Data were collected using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress-Scale (DASS) at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and one month after the intervention. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, one-way ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvement occurred in depression, anxiety, and stress levels immediately and one month after the intervention in lavender and chamomile groups compared to the control group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Inhalation aromatherapy with both lavender and chamomile essential oils helped decrease depression, anxiety, and stress levels in community-dwelling older adults.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A parallel single-blind randomized clinical trial conducted on 45 patients who were undergoing chemotherapy. Patients were assigned to three equal groups. Group I received conventional symptomatic treatment that included antifungal agents (Miconaz oral gel, Medical Union Pharmaceuticals), topical anesthetics, and anti-inflammatory agent (BBC oral spray, Amoun Pharmaceutical Company) three times per day for three weeks, group II received 3% chamomile topical oral gel, whereas group III patients were given both conventional symptomatic treatment and chamomile topical oral gel. All patients were clinically assessed for pain and oral mucositis severity at three separate time intervals: 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks. RESULTS: Most patients experienced oral mucositis with more severity reported in the conventional group (grade III = 6.7%) compared to the other two groups, neither of which developed more than grade II. Mean pain scores showed no significant difference between the groups, but intragroup analysis showed that pain score increased in the conventional treatment group more than the other two groups.

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric disease. Roman chamomile as medicine or tea has long been used as a mild tranquilizer to reduce anxiety, but the mechanism is unclear. This research is based on network pharmacology combined with database mining to find the ingredients, action pathways and key targets of Roman chamomile for the treatment of anxiety. About 126 common targets related to chamomile and anxiety were obtained, and these targets were involved in 56 KEGG pathways. GEO screened LRRK2 as a key protein, and molecular docking showed that the protein could stably bind to drug components. Roman chamomile has the characteristics of multi-target and multi-pathway in the treatment of anxiety disorder. Its possible mechanism is to intervene anxiety disorder in the process of disease development, such as neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, serotonin synapse, and cAMP signaling pathway. LRRK2 may be an important gene for Roman chamomile in the treatment of anxiety disorder. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Roman chamomile is well known for its use in medicine and tea making. It contains many nutrients, which can relieve people's anxiety, help sleep, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. In this article, through network pharmacology combined with Gene Expression Omnibus data mining and molecular docking, the target and mechanism of Roman chamomile in the treatment of anxiety were discussed, and its efficacy was verified by model animals, which not only clarified its mechanism at the systematic level, but also proved to be effective at the biological level. It provides a reference for the further development and utilization of Roman chamomile.",

Chamomile (Matrricaria chamomilla) has extensive clinical uses in traditional-Persian medicine for its therapeutic properties. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of chamomile extract on the clinical symptoms of patients with CRS in a university hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized double-blind placebo-group clinical trial, 74 CRS patients were examined by an otolaryngologist blinded to the study groups, and the effects of treatment (according to SNOT-22 questionnaire) and possible complications recorded. Statistical analysis performed using SPSS software version 21, and level of significance considered as P < 0.05. RESULTS: Of the 74 patients (31 females and 43 male), 37 cases randomized in the intervention and 37 cases in the placebo group. The Lund-Mackay score, clinical findings in endoscopic nasal examination and mean score of the SNOT-22 were not significantly different at baseline visit between the two study groups. The adjusted mean score of quality of life during the four time periods in the intervention group (34.3, confidence interval of 95%: 31.8-36.7) was significantly lower than that of control group (45.9, confidence interval of 95%: 43.5-48.4) (P-value = 0.001). Also, clinical improvement in endoscopic nasal examination was significant in intervention group compared with placebo group. CONCLUSION: Chamomile extract is effective in further reducing the clinical symptoms and improving the quality of life of CRS patients.",

Subjects: 40 women aging >40 years with diagnosis of primary BMS. Settings/Location: Center of Diagnosis of Diseases of the Mouth, Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil. Design: This was an open clinical trial where primary BMS patients used the homemade salivary. At the first appointment, after 30 and 60 days, the authors evaluated the pattern and intensity of BMS and xerostomia symptoms, and then determined and compared the unstimulated salivary flow rate (SFR), viscosity, and salivary pH. MMP2 and MMP9 activities in saliva and cytotoxicity were assessed using different concentrations of chamomile flower and flax seed separately. Interventions: Subjects used the homemade salivary substitute for 3 months and were instructed to rinse their mouth three to four times daily for 1 min. Outcome measures: A numeric rating scale to evaluate the intensity of burning sensation and xerostomia symptoms, salivary flow rate (SFR) to determine salivary volume, dynamic rheology technique for viscosity and a digital meter for salivary pH. MMP2 and MMP9 activities in saliva and cytotoxicity were assessed by zymography and cell viability assay respectively. Results: After treatment, severity of BMS symptoms decreased, the SFR increased, salivary viscosity decreased, and severity of xerostomia sensation (in patients who reported having this symptom) improved (p < 0.05). Chamomile flower and flax seed had no effect on inhibiting MMP2 and MMP9 activities, and neither showed cellular cytotoxic effects. Conclusion: This homemade salivary substitute is an economical, viable, easily manipulated, noncytotoxic, and a practical alternative to relieve BMS symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Recent clinical evidence suggests the efficacy of a traditional herbal medicinal product containing myrrh (Commiphora molmol Engl.), coffee charcoal (Coffea arabica L.) and chamomile flower dry extract (Matricaria chamomilla L.) in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, the mechanisms of action in this context have not been entirely elucidated. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of myrrh, coffee charcoal and chamomile flower extract on the inflammatory cross talk between immune and intestinal epithelial cells together with the resulting intestinal barrier disorders. A complex co-culture cell model consisting of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) monolayers (Caco-2, HT29-MTX-E12) and macrophages (THP-1) was established for the simultaneous investigation of these two IBD characteristics. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of the macrophages led to a pro-inflammatory mediator release and thereby an inflammatory stimulation of IECs with chemokine release and reduced barrier function. The effects of the individual plant extracts and a ternary combination on inflammatory mediator release (IL-6, TNF, IL-8, MCP-1, PGE2) was quantified by ELISA. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of IEC monolayers was measured to evaluate the effects on the barrier function. Budesonide served as a positive control. All three plant extracts exhibited anti-inflammatory properties via the inhibition of the inflammatory mediator release to a varying extent. An intestinal barrier stabilising effect was observed for myrrh and coffee charcoal. Myrrh exerted the most distinct pharmacological activity. Dose reducing and synergistic interactions emerged within the threefold combination. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic basis for the use of the herbal combination of myrrh, coffee charcoal and chamomile flower extract in IBD treatment and underline the potential benefits of the phytotherapeutic multi-component/multi-target approach in this complex pathogenesis.",

Non-pharmacological interventions, as a safe method, can reduce anxiety. This study aimed to determine the effect of music therapy and aromatherapy with chamomile - lavender essential oil on the anxiety of clinical nurses. This was a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. One hundred twenty nurses from clinical wards of Besat Hospital in Sanandaj, Iran, were selected between 2018 and 2019 by purposeful sampling. The samples were randomly assigned to three groups with different interventions, namely music therapy, both aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil and music therapy, and aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil, along with a control group as well. The anxiety of nurses was measured based on the Beck Anxiety Inventory before the intervention and after three work shifts. The data were analyzed using the SPSS v.22 software. One-way ANOVA was used to test the hypotheses. The findings showed that the mean scores of the anxiety of nurses after the intervention in the three groups namely the group for which music therapy was applied, the group for which aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil was used and the group for which both music therapy and aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil were applied, were (39.28), (37.82) and (40.03), respectively. Therefore, the obtained mean score of each group was significantly lower than that of the control group (56.08) (p < 0.0001). The results showed that the interventions of music therapy and aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil could reduce the anxiety of nurses.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain after cesarean section can turn the pleasant event of childbirth into an unpleasant experience for the mother. Pain relief through non-pharmaceutical methods, such as aromatherapy, could potentially be a useful intervention. In this study, the analgesic effect of chamomile oil was studied. PURPOSE: The current research was conducted to study the effect of chamomile oil on cesarean section pain in primiparous women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind clinical trial wherein 128 primiparous pregnant women (who willingly selected cesarean section) took part. In the aromatherapy group, the subjects inhaled one drop of 5% chamomile oil, and in the control group, the subjects inhaled one placebo drop. In both groups, the subjects inhaled for 15-20 minutes at a distance of 5 cm from the nose at 4, 8, and 12 hours after surgery, and pain intensity was measured half an hour before and after inhalation using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). For data analysis, the software SPSS (version 25) and descriptive statistics (frequency, frequency percentage, mean, and standard deviation) were used. In order to determine the significance, inferential statistics (Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, independent t-test, and Chi-square) were used. FINDINGS: Data indicated that the intervention and placebo groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables. The average weights and heights of women in the intervention group were 86/5± 5/9 and 163/7 ±5/1, respectively. Corresponding values for women in the control group were 84/5± 5/7 kg and 163/4± 5/8 cm. The finding of the current research indicates that the intervention and placebo groups showed no significant statistical difference in terms of baseline pain before intervention (p=0.08), while the difference between the two groups was significant in terms of pain, 4, 8, and 12 hours after the intervention (p<0.01). Therefore, inhalation of chamomile oil reduced pain intensity significantly compared to post-intervention. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, inhalation of chamomile oil following the cesarean sectionin primiparous women reduced pain and also the need for analgesics. Therefore, the use of aromatherapy with chamomile oil as a simple way without any side effects for the reduction of pain in mothers after the cesarean section is recommended.",

The currently available medications are not ideal because of their limitations and side effects; hence, new target proteins and signaling cascades for precise and safe therapy treatment are needed. This work established an ovalbumin-induced asthma rat model and treated it with total flavonoid extract from the Xinjiang chamomile. The proteins that were differentially expressed in the chamomile extract-treated asthmatic rats and the asthma and healthy rat groups were identified using isobaric tagging followed by LC-MS/MS. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins was performed. RESULTS: Pathways involved in purine metabolism, herpes simplex infection, and JNK phosphorylation and activation mediated by activated human TAK1 were enriched, indicating the intrinsic links between the mechanism of asthma development and treatment effects. Furthermore, we constructed a protein-protein interaction network and identified KIF3A as a potential target protein of chamomile extract that affected the Hedgehog signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of asthma and reveal several proteins and pathways that could be exploited to develop novel treatment approaches.",

Of the herbal supplements mentioned for remedy PMS symptoms, chamomile used as an effective herbal medicine. The overall purpose of this review was to determine the efficacy of chamomile on the treatment PMS. An extensive research review using Web of Science, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register database, PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), CINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Psych INFO, Social Science Research Network, SID, Google Scholar, Iran Doc, Magiran and Iran Medex. Eligible studies were identified from English and Persian databases, published between 1990 and 2019. Studies were screened independently by two researchers who performed the data extraction. Of Twenty-seven studies identified, Eight RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Chamomile has been used to treat PMS relief because of therapeutic properties such as anti-inflammatory effects (Chamazulene and α-Bisabolol); anti-spasmodic effects (Apigenin, Quercetin, and Luteolin, Metoxicomarin, Matrisin, and Phytoestrogens); anti-anxiety effects (Glycine, Flavonoid). The results of this review show that Chamomile is effective for the treatment of PMS. Based on these results, we believe that Chamomile can be used as good herbal medicine to treat in women with PMS."

Participants in each group daily received 2.5 ml of either chamomile syrup or placebo syrup for a period of 30 days. Participants' white blood cell (WBC), and absolute neutrophil count (ANC), as well as their quality of life were evaluated. RESULTS: The study was completed with a total of 40 patients. An increasing trend of ANC was observed in the treatment group despite the decreasing trend in placebo group, which was statistically significant between the two groups (P Interaction=0.019, 95% confidence intervals=15.076-171.324). No serious side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: Using chamomile syrup as a complementary therapy in children with leukemia could improve their immunity (as it increased WBC) by minimizing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia."

METHOD: In a quasi-experimental study, 105 patients with burns were recruited by convenience sampling method and then assigned into three groups (control, placebo massage, and combined aromatic oil massage). The study intervention was performed 20min before bedtime in three sessions, within a week. The control group was only under daily routine care. The study data were collected using the Persian version of Spielberg's anxiety scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests were used to analyze the data in SPSS version 20. RESULTS: The results showed a significant difference among the three groups in terms of anxiety score (P<0.001) and in terms of sleep quality after the intervention (P=0.027). CONCLUSION: Since the aromatherapy massage as a non-pharmacological and simple method can improve the anxiety and quality of sleep in patients with burns, it is suggested that nurses and burn medical care team apply it to reduce burn patients' anxiety and promote their sleep quality. Applying massage alone also reduces anxiety in burn survivors.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: This exploratory analysis examined the putative antidepressant effect of Matricaria chamomilla L. (chamomile) extract in subjects with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with or without comorbid depression. It was hypothesized that chamomile extract would demonstrate similar anxiolytic activity in both subgroups, but superior antidepressant activity in GAD subjects with comorbid depression. Design: As part of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of chamomile extract for relapse prevention of GAD, 179 subjects received initial therapy with open-label chamomile extract 1500 mg daily for 8 weeks. Linear mixed-effect models were used to identify clinically meaningful changes in anxiety and depression symptoms between diagnostic subgroups. Settings/Location: The study took place at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA. Subjects: Subjects were ≥18 years old with a primary DSM IV-TR diagnosis of GAD. They were subcategorized into two diagnostic groups: GAD without comorbid depression (n = 100) and GAD with comorbid depression (n = 79). Interventions: Open-label chamomile extract 1500 mg was given daily for 8 weeks. Outcome measures: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7), Hamilton rating scale for anxiety, Beck anxiety inventory, Hamilton rating scale for depression (HRSD), the six-item core HRSD (items 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 13), and the Beck depression inventory (BDI). Results: The authors observed similar anxiolytic effects over time in both diagnostic subgroups. However, there was a greater reduction in HRSD core symptom scores (p < 0.023), and a trend level reduction in HRSD total scores (p = 0.14) and in BPI total scores (p = 0.060) in subjects with comorbid depression. Conclusions: M. chamomilla L. may produce clinically meaningful antidepressant effects in addition to its anxiolytic activity in subjects with GAD and comorbid depression. Future controlled trials in subjects with primary major depressive disorder are needed to validate this preliminary observation.",

We evaluated the efficacy of chamomile oil and nanoemulgel formulations as a natural alternative therapeutic option for atopic dermatitis.Research design and methods: Formulations were developed comprising chamomile oil: olive oil (1:1), Tween 20/80 or Gelucire 44/14 as surfactant-cosurfactant mixtures, propylene glycol (10%w/w), water and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (3%w/w). In-vitro physicochemical characterization, stability testing and in-vivo assessment of inflammatory biomarkers and histopathological examination of skin lesions were conducted in rats induced with atopic dermatitis.Results: Nanoemulgels G1 and X1 which displayed the smallest particle size of 137.5 ± 2.04 and 207.1 ± 5.44 nm, good homogeneity and high zeta-potential values of -26.4 and -32.7 mV were selected as the optimized emulgel. Nanoemulgels were nonirritating of pH value 5.56, readily spreadable, and were physically stable following 10 heating-cooling cycles. Treatment with nanoemulgels showed a two-fold decrease in duration of skin healing and no spongiosis compared to chamomile oil. Levels of biomarkers were reduced after topical application of both nanoemulgels and chamomile oil.Conclusion: Nanoemulgels are a potential cost effective, safe topical carrier system for chamomile in treating atopic dermatitis.",

In ulcerative colitis, short-chain fatty acids are often reduced, especially during flare. This study evaluated exploratively the pattern of butyrate and total short-chain fatty acids in patients with ulcerative colitis during flare treated either with mesalamine or a herbal preparation consisting of myrrh, chamomile flowers, and coffee charcoal which showed promising results in maintaining remission in a randomized double-blind, double-dummy, controlled clinical trial (EudraCT-Number 2007-007928-18). METHODS: Patients were treated with the herbal preparation or mesalamine. Clinical activity was monitored by Clinical Colitis Activity Index. Using gas chromatography, we analyzed fecal samples of 38 patients who experienced a flare during treatment. RESULTS: Paired t-test showed a significant decline of total short-chain fatty acids [M before = 66.12, SD = 39.59; M after = 29.83, SD = 15.05; 95% bootstrap confidence interval (20.53-55.30); P = 0.01) and of butyrate [M before 11.35, SD = 7.56; M after = 6.50, SD = 3.55; 95% bootstrap confidence interval (2.06-8.11); P = 0.02] in the event of a flare for patients treated with mesalamine but not for patients treated with the herbal preparation. CONCLUSION: Patients who received the herbal preparation did not show a significant decline of total short-chain fatty acids in the event of a flare. Since a decline of short-chain fatty acids might lead to unfavorable health impairments, a combination of the two treatments should be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has attracted tremendous attention for treatment of diabetes. Likewise, it seems that active ingredients of chamomile oil might have anti-diabetic effects. This work was conducted to investigate the effects of the combination of GLP-1 and chamomile oil on differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into functional insulin-producing cells (IPCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, adipose MSCs derived from the adult male New Zealand white rabbits were assigned into four groups: control (without any treatment); GLP-1 (in which cells were treated with 10 nM GLP-1 every other day for 5 days); chamomile oil (in which cells were treated with 100 ug/ml Matricaria chamomilla L. flower oil every other day for 5 days); and GLP-1+ chamomile oil (in which cells were treated with 10 nM GLP-1 and 100 μg/ml M. chamomilla flower oil every other day for 5 days). Characterization of isolated MSCs was performed using flow cytometry, Alizarin red S staining and Oil red O staining. The expressions of genes specific for IPCs were measured using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Measurement of insulin and the cleaved connecting peptide (C-peptide) in response to different concentrations of glucose, were performed using ELISA kits. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that isolated cells highly expressed MSC markers and were able to differentiate into osteocytes and adipocytes. Additionally, using GLP-1 in combination with chamomile oil exhibited higher levels of IPCs gene markers including NK homeobox gene 2.2 (NKX-2.2), paired box gene 4 (PAX4), insulin (INS) and pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1) as well as insulin and C-peptide secretion in response to different glucose concentrations compared to GLP-1 or chamomile oil alone (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings establish a substantial foundation for using peptides in combination with natural products to obtain higher efficiency in regenerative medicine and peptide therapy."

      "abstract": "It is well known that chamomile is one of the oldest known medicinal herbs and has been used to treat various disorders, but it is mainly German chamomile. The effects of Roman chamomile on depression still unclear. In this study, we used chronically stressed mice to investigate whether inhalation of Roman chamomile essential oil affects depression-like behavior. We previously reported that restraint and water immersion stress produce depression-like behavior and a blunted response to the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine. Each mouse was exposed to restraint and water immersion stress for 15 days, and resistance to the effect of clomipramine was induced in a behavioral despair paradigm. In the present study, we found that cotreatment with clomipramine and inhalation of Roman chamomile attenuated depression-like behavior in a forced swim test. Next, we examined the hippocampal mRNA levels of two cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6); a neurotrophic factor, brain derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF); and nerve growth factor (NGF). TNF alpha, IL-6 and BDNF mRNA levels did not change in the hippocampus of stressed mice. However, the NGF mRNA level was significantly decreased, and this decrease was not attenuated by treatment with clomipramine or inhalation of Roman chamomile alone. We also examined whether Roman chamomile combined with clomipramine treatment affects hippocampal neurogenesis and serum corticosterone levels. Stressed mice had fewer doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, but this was significantly attenuated by Roman chamomile and clomipramine treatment. In addition, the serum corticosterone level was also significantly decreased by treatment with Roman chamomile and clomipramine. These results suggest that Roman chamomile inhalation may enhance the antidepressant effect of clomipramine by increasing hippocampal neurogenesis and modulating corticosterone levels in patients with treatment-resistant depression.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats (N.Mari, 180-220 g) of either sex were given a single intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (7.5 IU/Kg) or the vehicle (saline). Treatment groups were given the same dose of bleomycin and then received different doses of oral chamomile hydroalcoholic extract (400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg/day) for two weeks. RESULTS: Histological and pharmacological experiments of bleomycin-treated animals showed that bleomycin could cause marked pulmonary fibrosis within two weeks. In addition, administration of Chamomile hydroalcoholic extract reduced such damages in lung tissue in a dose-dependent manner. Best results were obtained with 1500 /kg/day of Chamomile hydroalcoholic extract. CONCLUSION: From the results of current study, it can be concluded that Chamomile hydroalcoholic extract may be able to diminish the toxic effects of bleomycin on the lung tissues. Such effect of Chamomile can be attributed to the ingredients of this plant with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties."

      "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to study the efficacy and safety of chamomile for the treatment of state anxiety, generalized anxiety disorders (GADs), sleep quality, and insomnia in human. Eleven databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Central, and Scopus were searched to retrieve relevant randomized control trials (RCTs), and 12 RCTs were included. Random effect meta-analysis was performed by meta package of R statistical software version 3.4.3 and RevMan version 5.3. Our meta-analysis of three RCTs did not show any difference in case of anxiety (standardized mean difference = -0.15, 95% CI [-0.46, 0.16], P = 0.4214). Moreover, there is only one RCT that evaluated the effect of chamomile on insomnia and it found no significant change in insomnia severity index (P > 0.05). By using HAM-A scale, there was a significant improvement in GAD after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment (mean difference = -1.43, 95% CI [-2.47, -0.39], P = 0.007), (MD = -1.79, 95% CI [-3.14, -0.43], P = 0.0097), respectively. Noteworthy, our meta-analysis showed a significant improvement in sleep quality after chamomile administration (standardized mean difference = -0.73, 95% CI [-1.23, -0.23], P < 0.005). Mild adverse events were only reported by three RCTs. Chamomile appears to be efficacious and safe for sleep quality and GAD. Little evidence is there to show its effect on anxiety and insomnia. Larger RCTs are needed to ascertain these findings.",

MATERIALS/METHODS: The in vitro study assessed the antineoplastic effect of CHAM-MTC on the MCF-7 breast cancer cells while the in vivo therapeutic effectiveness and toxicities of CHAM-MTC were evaluated in Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) bearing mice. One hundred female Swiss albino mice, divided equally into non-EAC group (negative control), untreated EAC group (positive control) and three EAC groups received once intraperitoneal injection of 0.2ml CHAM-NE, 0.2ml Normal Saline (NS) contained MTC (1mg/kg) and 0.2ml CHAM-NE mixed with MTC (1mg/kg), respectively. RESULTS: The in vitro results indicated that CHAM-NE could potentiate the effect of MTC in sub-effective concentrations since the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was reduced by a factor of 21.94 when compared to the MTC-NS. The in vivo study revealed that mice treated with CHAM-MTC showed a significant increase in the median survival time (MST= 37 days) when compared to the MTC-NS treated group (MST= 29.50 days). In addition, CHAM-MTC showed protective ability against the oxidative stress and hepatic damage induced by EAC and MTC treatment. CONCLUSION: The combination of MTC with CHAM-NE could be valuable in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of MTC against EAC and in eliminating MTC-induced hepatotoxicity.",

This review was carried out consulting reports between 2008 and 2018 of PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Database, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. The chosen keywords were plant, phytochemical, oral mucosa, leukoplakia, oral lichen planus and oral health. A special emphasis was given to certain plants (e.g., chamomile, Aloe vera, green tea, and coffea) and plant-derived bioactives (e.g., curcumin, lycopene) with anti-oral mucosal lesion activity. Finally, preclinical (in vitro and in vivo) and clinical studies examining both the safety and efficacy of medicinal plants and their derived phytochemicals were also carefully addressed.",

The present study was conducted to evaluate the anthelmintic activity of chamomile methanolic extract (CME). METHODS: In vitro, the anthelmintic activities of CME were investigated on the L3 larvae of Heligmosomoides polygyrus in comparison to albendazole. In vivo, Swiss albino mice were infected with infective third (L3) larval stage of H. polygyrus by intragastric administration. Moreover, the effect of CME and albendazole on worm eggs, adult worms, serum cytokine production, and oxidative stress was studied. RESULTS: All used doses of CME showed a potent anthelmintic activity both in vitro and in vivo and the effect being similar to treatment with albendazole. Moreover, H. polygyrus infestation was accompanied by an intestinal oxidative stress status characterized by an increased lipoperoxidation, a depletion of antioxidant enzyme activity, as well as an overload of hydrogen peroxide. We have also recorded an increase of pro-inflammatory mediator (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) levels after treatment with CME (14 ± 0.8; 41 ± 2; 58 ± 4 pg/mg protein, respectively, with the concentration 800 mg/kg, body weight) when compared with infected control mice (20 ± 1; 59 ± 2, and 83 ± 4 pg/mg protein, respectively). However, extract treatment alleviated all the deleterious effects associated with H. polygyrus infection. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CME can be used in the control of gastrointestinal helminthiasis and associated oxidative stress.",

We used a computational approach based on pharmacophore modeling, docking, and molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the potential ability of 13 natural compounds from chamomile extracts to bind chymase enzyme. The results indicated that some chamomile compounds can bind to the active site of human chymase. In particular, chlorogenic acid had a predicted binding energy comparable or even better than that of some known chymase inhibitors, interacted stably with key amino acids in the chymase active site, and appeared to be more selective for chymase than other serine proteases. Therefore, chlorogenic acid is a promising starting point for developing new chymase inhibitors.",

In such cases, acetaminophen or ibuprofen are used to alleviate the symptoms. The objective of this study was assessment of efficacy of phytoneering extract BNO 1030 (Imupret®) in patients with acute non-bacterial tonsillitis. METHODS: This randomized, open-label, multicenter, comparative study randomised 238 outpatients aged 6-18 years to receive either BNO 1030 (Imupret®) as a supplement to standard symptomatic therapy, or standard therapy. Assessment criteria were as follows: sore throat dynamics at rest and at swallowing, throat irritation associated with cough, general condition, day of withdrawal of antipyretics, the share of treatment responders, as well as assessment of \"therapeutic benefit\" from the use of BNO 1030. RESULTS: Decreased intensity of acute tonsillitis symptoms to 1 point and lower, assessed using 4-point scale starting from the day 5 of treatment (p < 0.005), alleviation of local symptoms and general condition starting from day 2 of the disease (р < 0.001), withdrawal of antipyretics starting from day 4 of treatment (p < 0.005), increase of the number of treatment responders to 81.6% (p < 0.005) versus the control were reported. \"Therapeutic benefit\" was 4.2 days. All patients tolerated phytotherapy well, and no adverse reactions were seen. CONCLUSION: BNO 1030 (Imupret®) is a safe and effective product for treatment of acute non-bacterial tonsillitis in children aged 6-18 years, assuring therapeutic benefit when prescribed additionally to the standard symptomatic therapy.",

Under soil cultivation, Mn excess reduced growth and induced symptoms of oxidative stress (including total ROS, hydroxyl radical and lipid peroxidation as detected by fluorescence microscopy), concomitantly with depletion of non-protein thiols and ascorbic acid. Total soluble phenols and individual phenolic acids were rather depleted (p-coumaric, chlorogenic, and protocatechuic acids) or unaltered (vanillic and caffeic acids). Shoot Mn content reached 2806 μg/g DW with BAF 51.0 in the soil culture. In hydroponics, tetraploid plants contained less Mn in both shoots and roots than diploid ones with bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor (diploid/tetraploid) 57.1/37.9 and 0.39/0.32 in 1000 μM Mn treatment. Plants cultured in hydroponics revealed stimulation of some phenolic acids, mainly chlorogenic acid in the shoots and p-hydroxybenzoic and vanillic acids in the roots (more extensively in tetraploid ones which contained less Mn). Data indicate that excessive Mn accumulation has negative impact not only on the growth but also on phenolic metabolites in young plants mainly. Detailed comparison of the observed metabolic changes with limited literature focused on Mn physiology is provided as well.",

This study aims to assess the effect of topical chamomile oil on postoperative bowel activity after cesarian section. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was carried out in 2015 at Chamran Hospital in Iran. A block randomization list was generated for 142 parturient divided into three groups. In the intervention group (arm A) (n = 47), chamomile oil was applied topically on abdominal region after the stability of the patient. Placebo group (arm B) (n = 47) received placebo oil and control group (arm C) (n = 48) had no intervention. A recovery program was used after surgery for all participants. The primary outcome was time to first flatus. Secondary outcomes were time to bowel sounds, defecation, return of appetite, hospital stay, and rate of nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain. FINDINGS: Times to first flatus were significantly shorter in Group A (arm A vs. B, P < 0.001 and arm A vs. C, P < 0.001). In addition, time to first bowel sounds (arm A vs. B, P < 0.001 and arm A vs. C, P < 0.001) and return of appetite (arm A vs. B, P < 0.001 and arm A vs. C, P < 0.001) were significantly shorter in arm A. The times from surgery to first defecation were shorter in Group A versus B and C. However, there were no statistically significant differences between three groups. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that topical chamomile oil has a potential therapeutic effect on gastrointestinal motility and can reduce the duration of POI."

      "abstract": "AIMS: Glypican-4 (GPC-4) is a novel adipomyokine that enhances insulin signaling. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPLD1) is thought to release GPC-4 and is itself an insulin-regulated enzyme. Beneficial effects of exercise training and chamomile flowers extract (CFE) are shown through activation of PPARγ, which is a promising drug target in diabetes and associated with GPC-4 synthesis. This study investigated the effects of 14-week treadmill running and CFE on serum GPC-4, GPLD1, and insulin levels in streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA)-induced diabetic rats. METHODS: Thirty-two STZ-NA-induced diabetic male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control (C), training (T), CFE treatment (CFE), and training plus CFE treatment (TCFE) groups. The training groups were exercised on treadmill 5 days/week and the treating groups were fed with 200 mg/kg/day CFE in drinking water for 14 weeks. Finally, serum GPC-4, GPLD1, and insulin levels were analyzed via sandwich ELISA. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, serum insulin levels were significantly higher in the T, CFE, and TCFE groups (p < 0.05, p < 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively), while OGTT and serum GPLD1 levels were significantly lower in the T, CFE, and TCFE groups (all p < 0.001). Changes in serum GPC-4 levels were not significant. Serum GPLD1 levels were negatively correlated with insulin levels and HOMA-IS (both p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that endurance training and CFE may downregulate serum GPLD1 levels in STZ-NA-induced diabetic rats, which associate with the serum insulin profile. However, the results show that endurance training and CFE may not cause serum GPC-4 adaptation in STZ-NA-induced diabetic rats.",

The intervention group received 370 mg oral capsules of chamomile three times a day for 3 months. The control group did receive starch capsule (three times a day). Hormonal and lipid parameters were examined before and 3 months after the intervention. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 22.40 ± 5.10 and 24.38 ± 6.14 years in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Decreased level of testosterone was observed in the intervention group (in women with PCOS) who received chamomile capsules (P = 0.017). A significant difference was not seen in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P = 0.249), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.073), triglycerides (P = 0.603), the hormone dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P = 0.423), and the ratio of luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) in the experimental and control groups after the intervention (P = 0.420). CONCLUSION: According to the findings, oral administration of chamomile capsule caused a significant decrease in total testosterone levels in these patients. However, no significant change was reported with lipid parameters, the ratio of LH/FSH, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of insomnia increases with age. Chamomile is among the medicinal plants which are used as tranquilizer. Yet, there is inadequate experimental and clinical evidence regarding its hypnotic effects. This study sought to evaluate the effects of chamomile extract on sleep quality among elderly people. DESIGN: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was performed. SETTING: A convenient sample of sixty elderly people who aged sixty or more and lived in Kahrizak day care nursing home, Karaj, Iran, were randomly allocated to a control and a treatment group. The treatment group received chamomile extract capsules (200mg) twice a day for 28 consecutive days while the control group received wheat flour capsules (200mg) in the same manner. Using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, sleep quality was assessed immediately before, two weeks after beginning, immediately after the completion, and two weeks after the completion of the intervention. The data were analyzed via the independent-sample t, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests as well as the repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: The means of age in the control and the treatment groups were 70.73±6.44 and 69.36±4.99, respectively. Except for the habitual sleep efficiency component of the Sleep Quality Index, the study groups did not differ significantly from each other at baseline regarding the scores of the other components of the index. Moreover, at baseline, sleep quality in both groups was low, with no statistically significant between-group difference (P=0.639). However, after the intervention, sleep quality in the treatment group was significantly better than the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of chamomile extract can significantly improve sleep quality among elderly people. Thus, it can be used as a safe modality for promoting elderly people's sleep.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Dysfunctions in stress biology are hypothesized to contribute to anxiety disorders, and to be ameliorated during successful treatment, but limited clinical data exist to support this hypothesis. We evaluated whether increases in morning cortisol and the diurnal cortisol slope, markers of stress biology, are associated with clinical response to chamomile therapy among subjects with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). METHODS: Among 45 subjects with DSM-IV diagnosed GAD in an open-label clinical trial of chamomile, salivary cortisol was assessed for three days each pre- and post-treatment, at 8am, 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. Mixed model analyses assessed whether GAD symptom change predicted the degree to which cortisol levels changed during treatment. RESULTS: Symptom improvement during treatment was significantly associated with pre-to-post treatment changes in cortisol. Subjects who experienced more symptomatic improvement experienced significant increases in their morning salivary cortisol (β = 0.48, p < 0.001), and a greater decrease in cortisol from morning to the rest of the day (β = 0.55, p < 0.001). In addition, at baseline a lower cortisol level (β = -0.24, p = 0.023) and a lesser decrease in cortisol after morning (β = 0.30, p = 0.003) were associated with greater symptomatic improvement. CONCLUSION: Increases in morning salivary cortisol and the diurnal cortisol slope are associated with symptom improvement in chamomile treatment of GAD. Response to treatment for GAD could partially stem from normalization of stress biology dysfunction, but further work involving establishing abnormalities within-sample, ruling out of confounds (e.g., sleep), and a placebo control is necessary to conclude an amelioration effect.

      "abstract": "Breast pain (mastalgia) often precedes menstrual period, which is of mild to moderate severity. This study was performed to determine the effectiveness of chamomile on pain control of cyclic mastalgia. This double-blind randomised controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients with mastalgia referred to the breast clinic of an academic hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups: chamomile (n = 30) and placebo (n = 30). Primary outcomes were: (1) assessment of the visual analogue scale (VAS) and (2) assessment of the breast pain chart (BPC) 8 weeks after initial intervention. All the participants were asked to take drops three times a day each time having five drops for two consecutive months. Significant decline was observed in both the groups (chamomile and placebo) after two months (p < .0001 and p = .048, respectively) compared to baseline and between two groups (p = .007). Chamomile was a well-tolerated, secure and effective drug for treating women with mild to moderate mastalgia. Impact statement What is already known on this subject: Breast pain (mastalgia) is a common chief complaint reported by many women. The 'cyclic' type, which usually occurs monthly prior to the onset of menstrual period, is of moderate severity. In 30% of the cases, mastalgia is severe and disturbs normal life, leading to sexual, physical, and social dysfunction as well as depression and anxiety. The cause of cyclical mastalgia is not known, but given the fact that it begins in the luteal phase, it can be caused by hormonal stimulation. A variety of therapies have been recommended. Such therapies include prescription of vitamin B2, B6, E and C, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diuretics, thyroxin, progesterone, Tamoxifen, Danazol, Bromocriptine and plant extracts like vitexagnus castus, evening primrose oil (EPO). However, given the side effects of hormonal treatment, many women have developed a propensity towards the use of herbal medicine. What do the results of this study add: Chamomile presents a safe, well-tolerated and effective treatment for women with moderate mastalgia. What are the implications of these finding for clinical practice and/or further research: Considering that Danazol, Bromocriptine and Tamoxifen are standard treatments for mastalgia, it would be helpful to carry out a trial study to compare the effect of chamomile extract versus standard treatments. The physicians can prescribe chamomile as a safe alternative treatment for mastalgia.",
