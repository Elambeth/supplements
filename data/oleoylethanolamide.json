      "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system is involved in multiple drug-related behaviors and the transient increase in endogenous cannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like molecules contributes to healthy adaptation to stress exposure. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) belongs to the N-acylethanolamines and interacts with the endocannabinoid system. In this study, we investigated the effect of systemic OEA treatment (10 mg/kg), before or after social defeat (SD), on ethanol self-administration (SA). Mice were divided into non-stressed (EXP) and stressed (SD) groups and randomly assigned to a treatment condition (control-CTRL, OEA or 10OEA). The EXP/SD-OEA group of mice received four doses of OEA before each SD encounter, while mice in the EXP/SD-10OEA group received a daily dose for 10 consecutive days following stress exposure. Three weeks after SD, mice were trained to self-administer a 20 % (vol/vol) ethanol solution. Upon extinction, a cue-induced reinstatement test was performed. Our results showed that both OEA treatments effectively prevented the stress-induced increase in ethanol consumption observed in defeated mice. No significant effects of OEA on relapse-like behavior were observed. Additionally, we found that animals exposed to OEA during SD encounters showed reduced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) levels, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of OEA, while tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) gene expression decreased in defeated animals. In summary, these findings suggest that exogenously increasing OEA levels counteracts the adverse effects of stress on ethanol drinking while having some impact on inflammatory patterns.",

OEA is known as an anti-inflammatory lipid and acts as an endogenous ligand for GPR119. This study investigated the functional roles of GPR119 using a murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. The effects of OEA and AR231453, a selective synthetic GPR119 agonist, were tested on the CIA model in Gpr119 wild-type (WT) and deficient DBA-1 J mice. In the CIA model, administration of OEA or AR231453 reduced arthritis scores, foot thickness, loss of proteoglycan, and bone erosion in Gpr119 WT mice, but not in Gpr119-deficient mice. Treatment with OEA or AR231453 significantly suppressed the CIA-induced increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the feet and IgG levels in the serum, and rebalanced Th1/Th17 and Treg cells in the spleens of Gpr119 WT mice, but not in Gpr119-deficient mice. Additionally, OEA and AR231453 suppressed mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in human SW982 synovial cells. Both compounds also suppressed Th1/17 cell differentiation and enhanced Treg differentiation in splenocytes from Gpr119 WT mice, but not in Gpr119 knockout mice. These findings suggest that GPR119 activation may serve as a therapeutic strategy for rheumatoid arthritis by regulating Th1/Th17/Treg cell differentiation and rebalancing Th1/Th17 and Treg cells.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic and mood disorders elicited by chronic exposure of high-fat diet (HFD) are often associated with intestinal dysbiosis and persistent low-grade inflammation in the small intestine. This leads to remodeling of the epithelial barrier with disruption of the neuroepithelial circuits that control energy homeostasis by the gut-brain axis. Therefore, therapies that restoreintestinal microbial niche and barrier function are promising candidates to counter peripheral metabolic challenges that affect behaviors controlled by the brain. The endogenous oleoylethanolamine (OEA) was found to shape the intestinal microbiota profile towards a \"lean-like phenotype\", ameliorating pathological profiles of metabolic diseases. Further, OEA displays beneficial effects in several cognitive paradigms and preserves the epithelial barrier integrity, acting as an intestinal \"gate-keeper\". Here, we developed an \"intestinal OEA factory\" for the in-situ and controlled release of OEA by using a probiotic-based delivery system. We engineered the Lactobacillus paracasei F19 (LP) to express the human N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-preferring phospholipase D (NAPEpld) gene and to produce OEA in response to dietary ultra-low oleate supply. We treated 12-week HFD male mice with oleate-probiotic formulations and assessed their impact on metabolic and behavioral dysfunctions, and microbiota-gut-brain signaling after 8 weeks of treatment. NAPE-expressing LP (pNAPE-LP) led to significant reduced weight loss and improved metabolic dysfunction in HFD-treated mice. Further, a parallel improvement in depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes was associated with the duodenal barrier function retrieval, the restoration of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and an increase in beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Parabacteroides. The HFD-driven changes both in the enteric and central nervous system were prevented by pNAPE-LP/oleate treatment. Collectively, our data suggest that these effects were mediated by the oleate-dependent release of OEA by pNAPE-LP since no significant effects were observed in HFD mice treated with the native probiotic alone (pLP). This oleate-regulated delivery system of OEA is a safe and efficient probiotic-based strategy for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and related behavioral disorders."

OEA acts as an endogenous ligand for GPR119; thus, the functional roles of GPR119 were investigated using two murine models. We tested effects of OEA and AR231453, a selective synthetic GPR119 agonist on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced atopic dermatitis-like models in GPR119 wild-type (WT) and deficient mice. In OVA-induced allergic asthma model, administration of OEA or AR231453 reduced allergic feature, including airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophil accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, airway inflammation, and mucin secretion in the lungs, and both ameliorated DNCB-induced atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions, such as hypertrophy and mast cell accumulation, in GPR119 wild-type (WT) mice, but not in GPR119-deficient mice. OEA or AR231453 treatment reduced OVA-induced increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells in the lungs, and both significantly suppressed the DNCB-induced lymph node enlargement and inflammatory Th2/1/17 cells in GPR119 WT mice, but not in GPR119-deficient mice. In RBL-2H3 mast cells, OEA or AR231453 suppressed degranulation and Th2 cytokine expression. These findings suggest that OEA functions to protect against allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis via GPR119 activation by suppressing immune responses in the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin, highlighting GPR119 activation as a therapeutic target for allergic and inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Chronic lipid overnutrition has been demonstrated to promote cardiac dysfunction resulting from metabolic derangement, inflammation, and fibrosis. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous peroxisome proliferator activating receptor (PPAR)-α agonist, has been extensively studied for its metabolic properties. The aim of this study was to determine if OEA has beneficial effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cardiac disruption in obese mice, focusing on the underlying pathological mechanisms. OEA treatment restores the metabolic pattern, improving serum glycaemic and lipid profile. OEA also reduces heart weight and serum creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), a marker of cardiac damage. Accordingly, OEA modulates cardiac metabolism, increasing insulin signaling and reducing lipid accumulation. OEA increases AMPK and AKT phosphorylation, converging in the rise of AS160 activation and glucose transporter (GLUT)4 protein level. Moreover, OEA reduces the transcription of the cardiac fatty acid transporter CD36 and fatty acid synthase and increases PPAR-α mRNA levels. Adiponectin and meteorite-like protein transcription levels were significantly reduced by OEA in HFD mice, as well as those of inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrotic markers. An increased autophagic process was also shown, contributing to OEA's cardioprotective effects. Metabolomic analyses of cardiac tissue revealed the modulation of different lipids, including triglycerides, glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins by OEA treatment. In vitro experiments on HL-1 cardiomyocytes showed OEA's capability in reducing inflammation and fibrosis following palmitate challenge, demonstrating a direct activity of OEA on cardiac cells, mainly mediated by PPAR-α activation. Our results indicate OEA as a potential therapeutic to restrain cardiac damage associated with metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in biochemical parameters and changes in eating habits are considered complications of obesity. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endocannabinoid-like compound, has been shown to have protective effects on many metabolic disorders. Given this evidence, the present study aimed to assess the effects of OEA on lipid profile parameters, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and dietary habits in healthy obese people. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which was carried out in 2016 in Tabriz, Iran, 60 obese people were enrolled in the study based on inclusion criteria. The intervention group consumed 125 mg of OEA capsules, and the placebo group received the same amount of starch twice for 8 weeks. Blood samples (5 mL) were taken at baseline and the end of the study in a fasting state. Serum concentrations of FBS, triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured by enzymatic methods using commercial kits. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration was obtained using the Friede-Wald formula. To assess dietary habits, a food frequency questionnaire (147 items) was used at baseline and the end of the study. A value less than < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: The TG concentration decreased significantly in the intervention group (mean (SD): 166.29 (70.01) mg/dL to 142.22 (48.05) mg/dL, p = 0.047). Changes in the placebo group were not significant (p > 0.05). After adjusting for baseline values and demographic characteristics, the difference in TG between groups remained significant (p = 0.044). Changes in other biochemical parameters were not significant. There was no significant difference between or within groups in terms of food groups. CONCLUSION: OEA, as a complementary agent, plays a protective role in TG regulation. However, future studies with longer durations are needed to explore the impact of OEA on regulating dietary habits and to identify the mechanisms related to metabolic abnormalities in obese people.

Previous studies have shown that OEA treatment reduces alcohol self-administration (SA) while inhibiting alcohol-induced inflammatory signaling. Nevertheless, the specific mechanisms that OEA targets to achieve these effects have not been widely explored. Here, we tested the effects of OEA treatment during alcohol SA, extinction or previous to cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. In addition, we measured gene expression changes in the striatum and hippocampus of relevant receptors for alcohol consumption (Drd1, Drd2, Cnr1, Oprm) as well as immune-related proteins (Il-6, Il-1β, Tlr4) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). Our results confirmed that when administered contingently, systemic OEA administration reduced alcohol SA and attenuated cue-induced reinstatement. Interestingly, we also observed that OEA treatment reduced the number of sessions needed for the extinction of alcohol seeking. Biochemical analyses showed that OEA induced gene expression changes in dopamine and cannabinoid receptors in the striatum and hippocampus. In addition, OEA treatment modulated the long-term immune response and increased Bdnf expression. These results suggest that boosting OEA levels may be an effective strategy for reducing alcohol SA and preventing relapse.",

      "abstract": "Vascular calcification is a prevalent hallmark of cardiovascular risk in elderly and diabetic individuals. Senescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) participate in calcification; however, the associated underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Aberrant activation of the cytosolic DNA sensing adaptor stimulator of interferon gene 1 (STING1) caused by cytosolic DNA, particularly that leaked from damaged mitochondria, is a catalyst for aging-related diseases. Although oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous bioactive lipid mediator with lipid overload-associated vasoprotective effects, its benefit in diabetic vascular calcification remains uncharacterized. This study focused on the role of STING1 in mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated calcification and premature VMSC senescence in diabetes and the effects of OEA on these pathological processes. In diabetic in vivo rat/mouse aorta calcification models and an in vitro VSMC calcification model induced by Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), senescence levels, STING1 signaling activation, and mitochondrial damage markers were significantly augmented; however, these alterations were markedly alleviated by OEA, partially in a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent manner, and similar anti-calcification and senescence effects were observed in STING1-knockout mice and STING1-knockdown VSMCs. Mechanistically, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage was aggravated by CML in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner, followed by mtDNA leakage into the cytosol, contributing to VSMC senescence-associated calcification via STING1 pathway activation. OEA treatment significantly attenuated the aforementioned cytotoxic effects of CML by enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity through the maintenance of Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus. Collectively, targeting STING1, a newly defined VSMC senescence regulator, contributes to anti-vascular calcification effects.",

METHOD: This study was a randomized clinical trial, double-blinded, placebo-controlled that was carried out on 90 women with PCOS. Patients were divided into two groups: receiving an OEA supplement (n = 45) or a placebo (n = 45). The intervention group received 125 mg/day OEA and the placebo group received the wheat flour for 8 weeks. Demographic data were collected through questionnaires. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin resistance (IR), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and AMH were measured before and after the study. RESULTS: Data analysis of food recall and physical activity questionnaires, showed no significant differences between the two groups (p > 0.05). Biochemical factors including glycemic status, MDA, inflammatory factors, and AMH decreased significantly (p < 0.05). TAC increased remarkably (p < 0.05) in comparison between the two groups, after the intervention. CONCLUSION: OEA supplement with anti-inflammatory characteristics could be efficient independent of diet changes and physical activity in improving disrupted biochemical factors, so both supplementation or food resources of this fatty acid could be considered as a compensatory remedy in patients with PCOS.

      "abstract": "Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) are endogenous lipids that act as agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Recently, an interest in the role of these lipids in malignant tumors has emerged. Nevertheless, the effects of OEA and PEA on human neuroblastoma cells are still not documented. Type I interferons (IFNs) are immunomodulatory cytokines endowed with antiviral and anti-proliferative actions and are used in the treatment of various pathologies such as different cancer forms (i.e., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma, leukemia), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, and many others. In this study, we investigated the effect of OEA and PEA on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with IFNβ. We focused on evaluating cell viability, cell proliferation, and cell signaling. Co-exposure to either OEA or PEA along with IFNβ leads to increased apoptotic cell death marked by the cleavage of caspase 3 and poly-(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) alongside a decrease in survivin and IKBα levels. Moreover, we found that OEA and PEA did not affect IFNβ signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway and the STAT1-inducible protein kinase R (PKR). OEA and PEA also increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression both in full cell lysate and surface membranes. Furthermore, GW6471, a PPARα inhibitor, and the genetic silencing of the receptor were shown to lower PD-L1 and cleaved PARP levels. These results reveal the presence of a novel mechanism, independent of the IFNβ-prompted pathway, by which OEA and PEA can directly impair cell survival, proliferation, and clonogenicity through modulating and potentiating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in human SH-SY5Y cells.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenously generated cannabinoid-like compound, has been reported to be increased in patients with severe asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Recruitment of activated eosinophils in the airways is a hallmark of bronchial asthma. OBJECTIVE: We explored the direct contribution of cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), a cognate receptor of OEA, which induces eosinophil activation in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We investigated OEA signaling in the eosinophilic cell line dEol-1 in peripheral blood eosinophils from people with asthma. In order to confirm whether eosinophil activation by OEA is CB2 dependent or not, CB2 small interfering RNA and the CB2 antagonist SR144528 were used. The numbers of airway inflammatory cells and the levels of cytokines were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and airway hyperresponsiveness was examined in the BALB/c mice. RESULTS: CB2 expression was increased after OEA treatment in both peripheral blood eosinophils and dEol-1 cells. It was also elevated after OEA-induced recruitment of eosinophils to the lungs in vivo. However, SR144528 treatment reduced the activation of peripheral blood eosinophils from asthmatic patients. Furthermore, CB2 knockdown decreased the activation of dEol-1 cells and the levels of inflammatory and type 2 cytokines. SR144528 treatment alleviated airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophil recruitment to the lungs in vivo. CONCLUSION: CB2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of eosinophilic asthma. Our results provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of signal transduction by OEA in eosinophilic asthma.",

METHODS: Sixty obese patients with NAFLD were equally allocated into either OEA or placebo group for 12 weeks. The mRNA expression levels of genes were determined using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. Serum NRG4 level was also assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. RESULTS: At the endpoint, mRNA expression levels of SIRT1(p = 0.001), PGC-1α (p = 0.011) and AMPK (p = 0.019) were significantly higher in the OEA group compared to placebo group. However, no significant differences were observed in the expression levels of PPAR-γ, CEBP-α and CEBP-β between the two groups. Serum NRG4 levels significantly increased in the OEA group compared with the placebo group after controlling for confounders (p = 0.027). In the OEA group, significant relationships were found between percent of changes in the expression levels of the SIRT1, AMPK and PGC-1α as well as serum NRG4 level with percent of changes in some anthropometric measures. Moreover, in the intervention group, percent of changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was positively correlated with percent of changes in the expression levels of the SIRT1 and AMPK. While, percent of changes in triglyceride was inversely correlated with percent of changes in the expression levels of SIRT1. CONCLUSION: OEA could beneficially affect expression levels of some lipid metabolism-related genes and serum NRG4 level. \"REGISTERED UNDER IRANIAN REGISTRY OF CLINICAL TRIALS IDENTIFIER NO: IRCT20090609002017N32\".",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Our previous study has revealed that OEA promotes motor function recovery in the chronic stage of ischemic stroke. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of OEA on motor function recovery after stroke still is unexplored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of OEA treatment on angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and white matter repair in the peri-infarct region after cerebral ischemia. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: The adult male rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The rats were treated with 10 and 30 mg/kg OEA or vehicle daily starting from day 2 after ischemia induction until they were sacrificed. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that OEA increased cortical angiogenesis, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) proliferation, migration, and differentiation. OEA treatment enhanced the survival of newborn neurons and oligodendrogenesis, which eventually repaired the cortical neuronal injury and improved motor function after ischemic stroke. Meanwhile, OEA treatment promoted the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrogenesis by activating the PPARα signaling pathway. Our results showed that OEA restores motor function by facilitating cortical angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and white matter repair in rats after ischemic stroke. Therefore, we demonstrate that OEA facilitates functional recovery after ischemic stroke and propose the hypothesis that the long-term application of OEA mitigates the disability after stroke.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Age is the strongest risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides the pathological hallmarks of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, emerging evidence demonstrates a critical role of microglia and neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous lipid amide that has been shown to promote lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans through regulation of lysosome-to-nucleus signaling and cellular metabolism. The goal of our study was to determine the role of OEA in the mediation of microglial activity and AD pathology using its stable analog, KDS-5104. METHODS: We used primary microglial cultures and genetic and pharmacological approaches to examine the signaling mechanisms and functional roles of OEA in mediating Aβ phagocytosis and clearance, lipid metabolism and inflammasome formation. Further, we tested the effect of OEA in vivo in acute LPS-induced neuroinflammation and by chronic treatment of 5xFAD mice. RESULTS: We found that OEA activates PPARα signaling and its downstream cell-surface receptor CD36 activity. In addition, OEA promotes TFEB lysosomal function in a PPARα-dependent but mTORC1-independent manner, the combination of which leads to enhanced microglial Aβ uptake and clearance. These are associated with the suppression of LPS-induced lipid droplet accumulation and inflammasome activation. Chronic treatment of 5xFAD mice with KDS-5104 restored dysregulated lipid profiles, reduced reactive gliosis and Aβ pathology and rescued cognitive impairments. CONCLUSION: Together, our study provides support that augmenting OEA-mediated lipid signaling may offer therapeutic benefit against aging and AD through modulating lipid metabolism and microglia phagocytosis and clearance.",

      "abstract": "Modulation of bile acid (BA) structure is a potential strategy for obesity and metabolic disease treatment. BAs act not only as signaling molecules involved in energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis, but also as regulators of food intake. The structure of BAs, particularly the position of the hydroxyl groups of BAs, impacts food intake partly by intestinal effects: (1) modulating the activity of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D, which produces the anorexigenic bioactive lipid oleoylethanolamide (OEA) or (2) regulating lipid absorption and the gastric emptying-satiation pathway. We hypothesized that 16α-hydroxylated BAs uniquely regulate food intake because of the long intermeal intervals in snake species in which these BAs are abundant. However, the effects of 16α-hydroxylated BAs in mammals are completely unknown because they are not naturally found in mammals. To test the effect of 16α-hydroxylated BAs on food intake, we isolated the 16α-hydroxylated BA pythocholic acid from ball pythons (Python regius). Pythocholic acid or deoxycholic acid (DCA) was given by oral gavage in mice. DCA is known to increase N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D activity better than other mammalian BAs. We evaluated food intake, OEA levels, and gastric emptying in mice. We successfully isolated pythocholic acid from ball pythons for experimental use. Pythocholic acid treatment significantly decreased food intake in comparison to DCA treatment, and this was associated with increased jejunal OEA, but resulted in no change in gastric emptying or lipid absorption. The exogenous BA pythocholic acid is a novel regulator of food intake and the satiety signal for OEA in the mouse intestine.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Social stress contributes to the development of depressive and anxiety symptomatology and promotes pro-inflammatory signaling in the central nervous system. In this study, we explored the effects of a lipid messenger with anti-inflammatory properties - oleoylethanolamide (OEA) - on the behavioral deficits caused by social stress in both male and female mice. METHODS: Adult mice were assigned to an experimental group according to the stress condition (control or stress) and treatment (vehicle or OEA, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Male mice in the stress condition underwent a protocol consisting of four social defeat (SD) encounters. In the case of female mice, we employed a procedure of vicarious SD. After the stress protocol resumed, anxiety, depressive-like behavior, social interaction, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) were assessed. In addition, we characterized the stress-induced inflammatory profile by measuring IL-6 and CX3CL1 levels in the striatum and hippocampus. RESULTS: Our results showed that both SD and VSD induced behavioral alterations. We found that OEA treatment restored PPI deficits in socially defeated mice. Also, OEA affected differently stress-induced anxiety and depressive-like behavior in male and female mice. Biochemical analyses showed that both male and female stressed mice showed increased levels of IL-6 in the striatum compared to control mice. Similarly, VSD female mice exhibited increased striatal CX3CL1 levels. These neuroinflammation-associated signals were not affected by OEA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results confirm that SD and VSD induced behavioral deficits together with inflammatory signaling in the striatum and hippocampus. We observed that OEA treatment reverses stress-induced PPI alterations in male and female mice. These data suggest that OEA can exert a buffering effect on stress-related sensorimotor gating behavioral processing.",

PPARα agonists partially dampen this neuroinflammation in some models of brain insult, but neuronal loss was not the triggering cause in any of them. This study examines the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of the PPARα agonist oleoylethanolamide (OEA) in the Purkinje Cell Degeneration (PCD) mouse, which exhibits striking neuroinflammation caused by aggressive loss of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining, we quantified changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory markers, microglial density and marker-based phenotype, and overall leukocyte recruitment at different time points after OEA administration. OEA was found to modulate cerebellar neuroinflammation by increasing the gene expression of proinflammatory mediators at the onset of neurodegeneration and decreasing it over time. OEA also enhanced the expression of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective factors and the Pparα gene. Regarding microgliosis, OEA reduced microglial density-especially in regions where it is preferentially located in PCD mice-and shifted the microglial phenotype towards an anti-inflammatory state. Finally, OEA prevented massive leukocyte infiltration into the cerebellum. Overall, our findings suggest that OEA may change the environment to protect neurons from degeneration caused by exacerbated inflammation.",

However, there is limited experimental evidence about the specific neurotransmission systems OEA may be affecting to exert this modulatory effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of OEA on the rewarding properties of cocaine and relapse-related gene expression in the striatum and hippocampus. For this purpose, we evaluated male OF1 mice on a cocaine-induced CPP procedure (10 mg/kg) and after the corresponding extinction sessions, we tested drug-induced reinstatement. The effects of OEA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were evaluated at three different timepoints: (1) Before each cocaine conditioning session (OEA-C), (2) Before extinction sessions (OEA-EXT) and (3) Before the reinstatement test (OEA-REINST). Furthermore, gene expression changes in dopamine receptor D1 gene, dopamine receptor D2 gene, opioid receptor µ, cannabinoid receptor 1, in the striatum and hippocampus were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The results obtained in the study showed that OEA administration did not affect cocaine CPP acquisition. However, mice receiving different OEA treatment schedules (OEA-C, OEA-EXT and OEA-REINST) failed to display drug-induced reinstatement. Interestingly, the administration of OEA blocked the increase of dopamine receptor gene D1 in the striatum and hippocampus caused by cocaine exposure. In addition, OEA-treated mice exhibited reduced striatal dopamine receptor gene D2 and cannabinoid receptor 1. Together, these findings suggest that OEA may be a promising pharmacological agent in the treatment of cocaine use disorder.",

      "abstract": "Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) has been demonstrated to be a feasible protectant in ischemic stroke. However, the mechanism for OEA-afforded neuroprotection remains elusive. The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of OEA on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)-mediated microglia M2 polarization after cerebral ischemia. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was induced for 1 h in wild-type (WT) or PPARα-knock-out (KO) mice. Mouse small glioma cells (BV2) microglia and primary microglia cultures were used to evaluate the direct effect of OEA on microglia. A coculture system was used to further elucidate the effect of OEA on microglial polarization and ischemic neurons' fate. OEA promoted the microglia switch from an inflammatory M1 phenotype to the protective M2 phenotype and enhanced the binding of PPARα with the arginase1 (Arg1) and Ym1 promoter in WT mice but not in KO mice after MCAO. Notably, the increased M2 microglia caused by OEA treatment were strongly linked to neuron survival after ischemic stroke. In vitro studies confirmed that OEA shifted BV2 microglia from (lipopolysaccharide) LPS-induced M1-like to M2-like phenotype through PPARα. Additionally, the activation of PPARα in primary microglia by OEA led to an M2 protective phenotype that enhanced neuronal survival against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in the coculture systems. Our findings demonstrate the novel effects of OEA in enhancing microglia M2 polarization to protect neighboring neurons by activating the PPARα signal, which is a new mechanism of OEA against cerebral ischemic injury. Therefore, OEA might be a promising therapeutic drug for stroke and targeting PPARα-mediated M2 microglia may represent a new strategy to treat ischemic stroke."

      "abstract": "A vast literature strongly suggests that the endocannabinoid (eCB) system and related bioactive lipids (the paracannabinoid system) contribute to numerous physiological processes and are involved in pathological conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and intestinal inflammation. The gut paracannabinoid system exerts a prominent role in gut physiology as it affects motility, permeability, and inflammatory responses. Another important player in the regulation of host metabolism is the intestinal microbiota, as microorganisms are indispensable to protect the intestine against exogenous pathogens and potentially harmful resident microorganisms. In turn, the composition of the microbiota is regulated by intestinal immune responses. The intestinal microbial community plays a fundamental role in the development of the innate immune system and is essential in shaping adaptive immunity. The active interplay between microbiota and paracannabinoids is beginning to appear as potent regulatory system of the gastrointestinal homeostasis. In this context, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a key component of the physiological systems involved in the regulation of dietary fat consumption, energy homeostasis, intestinal motility, and a key factor in modulating eating behavior, is a less studied lipid mediator. In the small intestine namely duodenum and jejunum, levels of OEA change according to the nutrient status as they decrease during food deprivation and increase upon refeeding. Recently, we and others showed that OEA treatment in rodents protects against inflammatory events and changes the intestinal microbiota composition. In this review, we briefly define the role of OEA and of the gut microbiota in intestinal homeostasis and recapitulate recent findings suggesting an interplay between OEA and the intestinal microorganisms.",

      "abstract": "Background: Oxidative stress is considered a major factor in the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD). A growing body of evidence indicates that oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a bioactive lipid mediator, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This trial investigated the effects of OEA administration on inflammatory markers, oxidative stress and antioxidant parameters of patients with NAFLD. Methods: The present randomized controlled trial was conducted on 60 obese patients with NAFLD. The patients were treated with OEA (250 mg/day) or placebo along with a low-calorie diet for 12 weeks. Inflammatory markers and oxidative stress and antioxidant parameters were evaluated pre-and post-intervention. Results: At the end of the study, neither the between-group changes, nor the within-group differences were significant for serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis-factor α (TNF-α). Serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) significantly increased and serum concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) significantly decreased in the OEA group compared to placebo at study endpoint (p = 0.039, 0.018, 0.003 and 0.001, respectively). Although, no significant between-group alterations were found in glutathione peroxidase and catalase. There were significant correlations between percent of changes in serum oxidative stress and antioxidant parameters with percent of changes in some anthropometric indices in the intervention group. Conclusion: OEA supplementation could improve some oxidative stress/antioxidant biomarkers without any significant effect on inflammation in NAFLD patients. Further clinical trials with longer follow-up periods are demanded to verify profitable effects of OEA in these patients.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Among the fatty acid ethanolamides (FAEs), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), linoleoylethanolamide (LEA), and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) are reported to be involved in feeding regulation. In particular, OEA is well characterized as a satiety signal. Following food consumption, OEA is synthesized from oleic acid (OA) via an N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D-dependent pathway in the gastroenterocytes, and OEA induces satiety by recruiting sensory fibers. Thus, we hypothesized that dietary OA is an important satiety-inducing molecule. However, there has been no direct demonstration of the effect of dietary OA on satiety induction without the influence of the endogenous biosynthesis of OA from stearic acid (SA) or other FAEs. METHODS: In this study, we used two experimental diets to test our hypothesis: (i) an OA diet (OAD; 38.4 mg of OA/g and 7.2 mg of SA/g) and (ii) a low OA diet (LOAD; 3.1 mg of OA/g and 42.4 mg of SA/g). RESULTS: Relative to mice fed the OAD, mice fed the LOAD for two weeks exhibited reduced levels of jejunal OEA but not jejunal LEA and PEA. The LOAD-fed mice showed an increase in food intake and body weight gain. Moreover, LOAD-induced increase in food intake was immediately observed after the switch from the OAD, whereas these effects were diminished by the switch back to the OAD. Furthermore, treatment with OA and OEA diminished the effects of LOAD on food intake. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results show that dietary OA is a key factor in the reduction of food intake and increase in satiety mediated by OEA signaling.",

      "abstract": "The lipid-derived messenger oleoylethanolamide (OEA) has been involved in multiple physiological functions including metabolism and the immune response. More recently, OEA has been observed to affect reward-related behavior. Stress is a major risk factor for drug use and a predictor of drug relapse. In the laboratory, social stress has been largely studied using the social defeat (SD) model. Here, we explored the effects of different OEA administration schedules on the increased rewarding properties of cocaine induced by SD. In addition, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory action of OEA pretreatment in TLR4 expression caused by SD in the cerebellum, a novel brain structure that has been involved in the development of cocaine addiction. Adult OF1 mice were assigned to an experimental group according to the stress condition (exploration or SD) and treatment (OEA before SD, OEA before conditioning or subchronic OEA treatment). Mice were administered with OEA i.p (10 mg/kg) 10 min previously to the corresponding event. Three weeks after the last SD encounter, conditioned place preference (CPP) was induced by a subthreshold cocaine dose (1 mg/kg). As expected, socially defeated mice presented greater vulnerability to the cocaine reinforcing effects and expressed CPP. Conversely, this effect was not observed under a non-stressed condition. Most importantly, we observed that OEA pretreatment before SD or before conditioning prevented cocaine CPP in defeated mice. Biochemical analysis showed that OEA administration before SD decreased proinflammatory TLR4 upregulation in the cerebellum caused by social stress. In summary, our results suggest that OEA may have a protective effect on stress-induced increased cocaine sensitivity by exerting an anti-inflammatory action.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence implicates impaired microglia function and dysregulation of lipid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous lipid and PPARα agonist, has been shown to promote longevity in C. elegans through regulation of lysosome-to-nucleus signaling and cellular metabolism. Using a stable OEA analog, KDS-5104, we found that OEA-PPARα signaling promotes TFEB lysosomal activity independent of mTORC1 and upregulates cell-surface receptor CD36, leading to enhanced microglial Aβ uptake and clearance. These are associated with the suppression of LPS-induced lipid droplet accumulation and inflammasome activation. Chronic treatment of the 5xFAD mice with KDS-5104 restored dysregulated profiles, reduced reactive gliosis and Aβ pathology and rescued cognitive impairments. Together, our study provides support that augmenting OEA-mediated lipid signaling may offer therapeutic benefit against aging and AD through modulating lipid metabolism and microglia phagocytosis and clearance."

      "abstract": "Vascular calcification, a prevalent pathological alteration in metabolic syndromes, is tightly related with cardiometabolic risk events. Ferroptosis, a newly iron-dependent programmed cell death, induced by palmitic acid (PA), the major saturated free fatty acid in hyperlipidemia, is a vital mechanism of vascular calcification. Recent studies reported that ferroptosis is a distinctive type of cell death dependent on autophagy, with the lipotoxicity of PA on cell viability being closely linked with autophagy. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous bioactive mediator of lipid homeostasis, exerts vascular protection against intimal calcification, atherosclerosis; however, its beneficial effect on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-associated medial calcification has not been investigated. Our aim was to characterize the effect of OEA on vascular calcification and ferroptosis of VSMCs under hyperlipidaemia/PA exposure. In vivo, vascular calcification model was induced in rats by high-fat diet and vitamin D3 plus nicotine; in vitro, VSMCs ferroptosis was induced by PA or plus β-glycerophosphate mimicking vascular calcification. The calcium deposition in hyperlipidaemia-mediated rat thoracic aortas, the PA-induced ferroptosis and subsequent calcium deposition in VSMCs, were suppressed by OEA treatment. Additionally, CGAS-STING1-induced ferritinophagy, the main molecular mechanism of PA-triggered ferroptosis of VSMCs, was activated by mitochondrial DNA damage; however, early administration of OEA alleviated these phenomena. Intriguingly, overexpression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) contributed to a decrease in PA-induced ferroptosis, whereas PPARɑ knockdown inhibited the OEA-mediated anti-ferroptotic effects. Collectively, our study demonstrated that OEA serves as a prospective candidate for the prevention and treatment of vascular calcification in metabolic abnormality syndromes.",

AIS was confirmed based on a noncontrast head CT scan and also neurological symptoms. Patients were randomly and blindly assigned to OEA of 300 mg/day (n = 20) or 600 mg/day (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) in addition to the standard AIS treatment for three days. A blood sample was drawn at 12 hours from symptoms onset or LKW as the baseline followed by the second blood sample at 72 hours post symptoms onset or LKW. Blood samples were assessed for inflammatory and biochemical parameters, oxidative stress (OS) biomarkers, and lipid profile. RESULTS: Compared to the baseline, there is a significant reduction in the urea, creatinine, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, cholesterol, alanine transaminase, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde (MDA), total thiol groups (TTG), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein levels on the follow-up blood testing in the OEA (300 mg/day) group. In patients receiving OEA (600 mg/day) treatment, there was only a significant reduction in the MDA level comparing baseline with follow-up blood testing. Also, the between-group analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between patients receiving OEA (300 mg/day) and placebo in terms of IL-6 and TTG level reduction when comparing them between baseline and follow-up blood testing. CONCLUSION: OEA in moderate dosage, 300 mg/day, add-on to the standard stroke treatment improves short-term inflammatory, OS, lipid, and biochemical parameters in patients with AIS. This effect might lead to a better long-term neurological prognosis.",

The study objective was to quantitatively examine growth characteristics and mitochondrial morphology of transformed lymphoblast cell lines derived from five patients with BTHS relative to five healthy controls, as well as the therapeutic potential of oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and linoleoylethanolamide (LEA). These bioactive lipids both activate PPARα, which may be therapeutic. BTHS lymphoblasts grew more slowly than controls, suggesting lymphopenia merits clinical investigation. Treatment of BTHS lymphoblasts with OEA, but not LEA, significantly restored mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as colony growth in all BTHS lymphoblast lines, although a full growth rescue was not achieved. Quantification analysis of electron micrographs from three BTHS and healthy lymphoblast donors indicated similar numbers of mitochondria per cell, but lower average cristae length per mitochondrion, and higher mitochondrial density. Additionally, BTHS lymphoblasts had larger mitochondria, and a higher percentage of abnormally large mitochondria (> 1 μm2) than healthy controls. Notably, OEA treatment significantly restored mitochondrial size, without affecting density or cristae lengths. Cardiolipin total content, relative linoleic acid content and monolysocardiolipin:cardiolipin ratios were not improved by OEA, indicating that effects on growth, and mitochondrial morphology and function, occurred without resolving this deficit. However, immunoblotting showed higher levels of OPA1, a biomarker for mitochondrial fusion, in BTHS lymphoblasts, which was attenuated by OEA treatment, implicating altered mitochondrial dynamics in the pathology and treatment of BTHS.",

This study was conducted to assess effect of oleoylethanolamide (OEA) supplementation on glycemic status, insulin resistance (IR) and inflammatory factor in pre-diabetic individuals. METHODS: This double-blind randomized clinical trial was done at Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in which 46 pre-diabetic patients were divided into two equal groups and received one 125 mg OEA capsule in the intervention group (23 subjects) and 125 mg capsule containing wheat flour in placebo group daily for 8 weeks. After collecting demographic information, at the beginning and end of the study, the questionnaires of physical activity, 24-hour food recall were completed and blood glucose (BG), plasma insulin level, IR, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: At the beginning and end of the study, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of anthropometric indices, food intake and physical activity (P > 0.05). At the end of the study, consumption of OEA significantly reduced BS, insulin, IR, HbA1c, and CRP (P < 0.05). No significant change was observed in mentioned biochemical factors in placebo group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Given that OEA supplementation improved the glycemic status, IR and reduced the inflammatory factor, use of this supplement can be introduced as a useful supplement to control pre-diabetes status.

Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a structural congener of endocannabinoid anandamide, is the endogenous agonist of peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor α (PPARα) and transient receptor potential cation channel vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), and involved in many physiological processes. The present study aimed to determine whether OEA treatment protects against DOX-induced cytotoxicity (DIC) and gain insights into the underlying mechanism that mediate these effects. Our data revealed that Oleoylethanolamide treatment improved the myocardial structure in DOX-challenged mice by attenuating cardiac oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. OEA also alleviated DOX-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis dysregulation in HL-1 cardiomyocyte. These effects were mediated by activation of TRPV1 and upregulation of PI3K/ Akt signaling pathway. Inhibition of TRPV1 and PI3K reversed the protective effects of OEA. Taken together, our data suggested that OEA protects against DIC through a TRPV1- mediated PI3K/ Akt pathway."

      "abstract": "Liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a primary complication in major liver surgery. Our previous study about proteome profiling has revealed that the PPAR signaling cascade was significantly upregulated during liver ischemia/reperfusion. To elucidate the potential mechanisms of PPARα involved in I/R injury, we used oleoylethanolamide (OEA), the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonist, in this study. We demonstrated a protective role of OEA on liver I/R injury by using a mouse model of partial warm ischemia-reperfusion and hypoxia-reoxygenation model of hepatocytes. These effects were caused by ameliorating liver damage, decreasing the level of serum ALT and AST, and reducing the apoptosis of hepatocytes. Furthermore, a mechanistic study revealed that OEA regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by activating PPARα, thereby reducing ER stress-associated apoptosis to attenuate liver I/R injury. Briefly, these data first proposed that OEA-mediated PPARα activation could be an effective therapy against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury."

METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was done on population consisted of female students who had dysmenorrhea pain based on the visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire. Patients were randomly allocated to groups consuming a capsule containing 125 mg of OEA per day (n = 22) or placebo (n = 22) for 2 months. The severity of the pain, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were measured at the beginning and the end of the study. In this study, SPSS software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: According to the results, oral supplementation with OEA for 60 days significantly increased TAC (p = 0.022) and decreased the menstrual pain (p = 0.040), MDA (p = 0.011), CRP (p = 0.01), and TNF-α (p = 0.038) compared to the placebo group. Also, intragroup changes were statistically significant on the mean of pain (p = 0.042), TAC (p = 0.032), MDA (p = 0.023), CRP (p = 0.027), and TNF-α (p = 0.029) at the end of the study in the intervention group. Changes in the studied factors at the end of the study compared to the beginning of the study in the placebo group were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Considering the reducing effects of OEA on menstrual pain, using of this supplement can be introduced as an alternative medicine to reduce the use of anti-inflammatory drugs.",

METHODS: Forty adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited in the present study. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio to 1of 4 treatment groups: (A) 5 mg of boron citrate twice a day, (B) 200 mg of oleoylethanolamide twice a day, (C) both therapies, or (D) routine treatments without any study medications. At pre-and post-intervention phase, some clinical and biochemical parameters were assessed. RESULTS: Supplementation with boron citrate alone or in combination with oleoylethanolamide significantly improved O2 saturation and respiratory rate (p < 0.01). At the end of the study, significant increases in white blood cell and lymphocyte count were observed in the boron citrate and combined groups (p < 0.001). Boron citrate supplementation led to a significant decrease in serum lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.026) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.014), compared with other groups. Furthermore, boron citrate in combination with oleoylethanolamide resulted in a significant reduction in the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-1β concentrations (p = 0.031 and p = 0.027, respectively). No significant differences were found among four groups post-intervention, in terms of hemoglobin concentrations, platelet count, and serum interleukin-6 levels. At the end of the study, common symptoms of COVID-19 including cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and myalgia significantly improved in the supplemented groups, compared to the placebo (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with boron citrate alone or in combination with oleoylethanolamide could improve some clinical and biochemical parameters in COVID-19 patients.",

METHODS: Herein, we report a novel strategy for efficiently loading hydrophobic drugs to LNPs for stroke therapy. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous highly hydrophobic molecule with outstanding neuroprotective effect, was successfully loaded to OEA-SPC&DSPE-PEG lipid nanoparticles (OSDP LNPs) with a drug loading of 15.9 ± 1.2 wt%. Efficient retention in OSDP LNPs greatly improved the pharmaceutical property and enhanced the neuroprotective effect of OEA. RESULTS: Through the data of positron emission tomography (PET) and TTC-stained brain slices, it could be clearly visualized that the acute ischemic brain tissues were preserved as penumbral tissues and bounced back with reperfusion. The in vivo experiments stated that OSDP LNPs could significantly improve the survival rate, the behavioral score, the cerebral infarct volume, the edema degree, the spatial learning and memory ability of the MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion) rats. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that the OSDP LNPs have a great chance to develop hydrophobic OEA into a potential anti-stroke formulation.",

      "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic eosinophilic inflammatory disease with an increasing prevalence worldwide. Endocannabinoids are known to have immunomodulatory biological effects. However, the contribution of oleoylethanolamide (OEA) to airway inflammation remains to be elucidated. To investigate the effect of OEA, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines was measured by RT-qPCR and ELISA in airway epithelial (A549) cells. The numbers of airway inflammatory cells and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, airway hyperresponsiveness, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were examined in BALB/c mice after 4 days of OEA treatment. Furthermore, eosinophil activation after OEA treatment was evaluated by measuring cellular CD69 levels in eosinophils from human peripheral eosinophils using flow cytometry. OEA induced type 2 inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. OEA increased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-33, in A549 cells. In addition, it also induced eosinophilic inflammation, the production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-33 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and airway hyperresponsiveness. OEA increased the numbers of IL-5- or IL-13-producing ILC2s in a mouse model. Finally, we confirmed that OEA increased CD69 expression (an eosinophil activation marker) on purified eosinophils from patients with asthma compared to those from healthy controls. OEA may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma by activating ILC2s and eosinophils.",

In this study, we evaluated the effects of OEA on the disruption of both cerebellar structure and physiology and on the behavior of Purkinje cell degeneration (PCD) mutant mice. These mice exhibit cerebellar degeneration, displaying microtubule alterations that trigger the selective loss of Purkinje cells and consequent behavioral impairments. The effects of different doses (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and administration schedules (chronic and acute) of OEA were assessed at the behavioral, histological, cellular, and molecular levels to determine the most effective OEA treatment regimen. Our in vivo results demonstrated that OEA treatment prior to the onset of the preneurodegenerative phase prevented morphological alterations in Purkinje neurons (the somata and dendritic arbors) and decreased Purkinje cell death. This effect followed an inverted U-shaped time-response curve, with acute administration on postnatal day 12 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) being the most effective treatment regimen tested. Indeed, PCD mice that received this specific OEA treatment regimen showed improvements in motor, cognitive and social functions, which were impaired in these mice. Moreover, these in vivo neuroprotective effects of OEA were mediated by the PPARα receptor, as pretreatment with the PPARα antagonist GW6471 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) abolished them. Finally, our in vitro results suggested that the molecular effect of OEA was related to microtubule stability and structure since OEA administration normalized some alterations in microtubule features in PCD-like cells. These findings provide strong evidence supporting the use of OEA as a pharmacological agent to limit severe cerebellar neurodegenerative processes.",

Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous lipid messenger with multiple bioactivities, and has therapeutic effects on various liver diseases. However, effects of OEA on acute liver injury remains unknown. In this study, effects and mechanisms of OEA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/d-galactosamine (D-Gal)-induced acute liver injury in mice were investigated. We found that OEA treatment significantly attenuated LPS/D-Gal-induced hepatocytes damage, reduced liver index (liver weight/body weight), decreased plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Moreover, mechanism study suggested that OEA pretreatment significantly reduced hepatic MDA levels, increased Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activities via up-regulate Nrf-2 and HO-1 expression to exert anti-oxidation activity. Additionally, OEA markedly reduced the expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 to suppress hepatocyte apoptosis. Meanwhile, OEA remarkedly reduced the number of activated intrahepatic macrophages, and alleviated the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors, including TNF-α, IL-6, MCP1 and RANTES. Furthermore, OEA obviously reduced the expression of IL-1β in liver and plasma through inhibit protein levels of NLRP3 and caspase-1, which indicated that OEA could suppress NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. We further determined the protein expression of PPAR-α in liver and found that OEA significantly increase hepatic PPAR-α expression. In addition, HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP blocked the therapeutic effects of OEA on LPS/D-Gal-induced liver damage and oxidative stress, suggesting crucial role of Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway in the protective effects of OEA in acute liver injury. Together, these findings demonstrated that OEA protect against the LPS/D-Gal-induced acute liver injury in mice through the inhibition of apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation, and its mechanisms might be associated with the Nrf-2/HO-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathways."

A variety of beneficial effects have been attributed to OEA, although the greater interest is due to its potential role in the treatment of obesity, fatty liver, and eating-related disorders. To better clarify the mechanism of the antiadipogenic effect of OEA in the liver, using a lipidomic study performed by 1H-NMR, LC-MS/MS and thin-layer chromatography analyses we evaluated the whole lipid composition of rat liver, following a two-week daily treatment of OEA (10 mg kg-1 i.p.). We found that OEA induced a significant reduction in hepatic triacylglycerol (TAG) content and significant changes in sphingolipid composition and ceramidase activity. We associated the antiadipogenic effect of OEA to decreased activity and expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid and TAG syntheses, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1. Moreover, we found that both SREBP-1 and PPARγ protein expression were significantly reduced in the liver of OEA-treated rats. Our findings add significant and important insights into the molecular mechanism of OEA on hepatic adipogenesis, and suggest a possible link between the OEA-induced changes in sphingolipid metabolism and suppression of hepatic TAG level.",

The current interventional trial aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with oleoylethanolamide (OEA) in combination with weight loss intervention on some atherogenic indices as well as hematological parameters in patients newly diagnosed with NAFLD. Methods: In this triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 76 obese patients with NAFLD confirmed by ultra-sonographic findings were randomly assigned to receive a weight reduction diet plus either 250 mg OEA (n=38) or placebo (n=38) for 12 weeks. Atherogenic factors including total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/HDL-C, triglyceride (TG)/HDL-C, non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratios and non-HDL-C level, as well as hematological parameters were assessed before and after intervention. Results : After adjustment for potential confounding factors, between group analyses demonstrated a significantly lower LDL-C/HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratios in the OEA group compared to the placebo, post-intervention (95% confidence interval [CI]:0.06 to 0.85, P = 0.024; 95% CI: -2.06 to -0.05, P = 0.039; 95% CI: -1.05 to -0.02, P = 0.042,respectively). Additionally, OEA supplementation could significantly decrease the levels of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) compared to the placebo at the endpoint after considering potential confounding variables (95% CI: -0.56 to -0.003, P = 0.041). No significant differences were found between the two study groups in terms of other hematological parameters. Conclusion: The results of the current study indicated that OEA supplementation had beneficial effects on LDL-C/HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratios as well as RDW in obese patients with NAFLD.

      "abstract": "Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder whose etiology is a thiamine deficiency (TD), with alcoholism being the main underlying cause. Previous evidence suggests the presence of initial neuroinflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress in the physiopathology, although the specific molecular mechanisms underlying TD-induced brain damage and behavioral disabilities are unknown. We explored the specific role of the innate immune receptor TLR4 in three murine models of WKS, based on the combination of a thiamine-deficient diet and pyrithiamine injections (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) over time. The Symptomatic Model (SM) allowed us to describe the complete neurological/neurobehavioral symptomatology over 16 days of TD. Animals showed an upregulation of the TLR4 signaling pathway both in the frontal cortex (FC) and cerebellum and clear motor impairments related with cerebellar dysfunction. However, in the Pre-Symptomatic Model (PSM), 12 days of TD induced the TLR4 pathway upregulation in the FC, which correlated with disinhibited-like behavior, but not in the cerebellum, and no motor impairments. In addition, we tested the effects of the biolipid oleoylethanolamide (OEA, 10 mg/kg, i.p., once daily, starting before any symptom of the pathology is manifested) through the Glucose-Precipitated Model (GPM), which was generated by glucose loading (5 g/kg, i.v., last day) in thiamine-deficient animals to accelerate damage. Pretreatment with OEA prevented the TLR4-induced signature in the FC, as well as an underlying incipient memory disability and disinhibited-like behavior. This study suggests a key role for TLR4 in TD-induced neuroinflammation in the FC and cerebellum, and it reveals different vulnerability of these brain regions in WKS over time. Pre-treatment with OEA counteracts TD-induced TLR4-associated neuroinflammation and may serve as co-adjuvant therapy to prevent WKS-induced neurobehavioral alterations.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigate the effect of boron-containing compounds and oleoylethanolamide supplementation on the recovery trend in patients with COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: The current study is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with parallel groups. PARTICIPANTS: The inclusion criteria include male and female patients≥18 years of age, with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or antibody test and with written informed consent to participate in this trial. The exclusion criteria include regular use of any other supplement, severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia, pregnancy and breastfeeding. This study is being conducted at Imam Reza Hospital, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients are randomly assigned to four groups. The first group (A) will take one capsule containing 5 mg of boron compounds twice a day for two weeks. The second group (B) will take one capsule containing 200 mg oleoylethanolamide twice a day for two weeks. The third group (C) will take one capsule containing 5 mg boron compounds with 200 mg oleoylethanolamide twice a day for two weeks, and the fourth group (D) does not receive any additional treatment other than routine treatments. Boron-containing compounds and oleoylethanolamide capsules will be synthesized at Nutrition Research Center of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary end point of this study is to investigate the recovery rate of clinical symptoms, including fever, dry cough, and fatigue, as well as preclinical features, including complete blood count (CBC), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) profiles within two weeks of randomization.

      "abstract": "Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous fatty acid ethanolamide known for its anti-inflammatory effects and its influence on gut microbiota composition; however, the effects of OEA in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain unknown. During in vitro experiments, OEA downregulated the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and reduced phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa (Iκ) Bα induced by lipopolysaccharide in human embryonic kidney cells. Moreover, OEA downregulated the expression of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-1β and inhibited the phosphorylation of IκBα and p65 induced by TNF-α in human enterocytes (Caco-2). The effect of OEA in reducing the expression of IL-8 was blocked by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α antagonist. During in vivo experiments on rats, colitis was induced by the oral administration of 8% dextran sulfate sodium from day 0 through day 5, and OEA (20 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected once a day from day 0 for 6 days. OEA administration significantly ameliorated the reduction in body weight, the increase in disease activity index score, and the shortening of colon length. In rectums, OEA administration reduced the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils and tended to reduce the histological score and the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Administration of OEA produced significant improvement in a colitis model, possibly by inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway through PPAR-α receptors. OEA could be a potential new treatment for IBD."

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of oleoylethanolamide (OEA) supplementation combined with calorie restriction on inflammation, body composition, and hepatic fibrosis among obese patients with NAFLD. In this 12-week randomized clinical trial, 76 obese patients newly diagnosed with NAFLD were randomly allocated into either OEA or placebo group. The weight-loss diet was also designed for both groups. Pre- and postintervention messenger RNA expression levels of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10, body composition, and NAFLD fibrosis score were assessed. At the end of the study, the OEA group showed lower NF-κB and IL-6 expression levels compared to the placebo (p < .01). However, IL-10 expression level was approximately twofold higher in the OEA group compared to the placebo group (p = .008). A significant reduction was observed in the fat mass of the OEA group compared to the placebo (p = .044) postintervention. In addition, OEA supplementation led to a significant increase in fat-free mass in the OEA group compared to the placebo (p = .032). A remarkable increase was observed in resting metabolic rate (RMR) in the OEA group (p = .009); however, it was not found in the placebo group. There were no significant between-group differences in RMR postintervention. In addition, no significant within-and between-group differences were observed in the NAFLD fibrosis score at the end of the trial. Treatment with OEA along with weight-loss intervention could significantly improve inflammation and body composition in patients with NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most frequent eating disorder, for which current pharmacotherapies show poor response rates and safety concerns, thus highlighting the need for novel treatment options. The lipid-derived messenger oleoylethanolamide (OEA) acts as a satiety signal inhibiting food intake through the involvement of central noradrenergic and oxytocinergic neurons. We investigated the anti-binge effects of OEA in a rat model of binge-like eating, in which, after cycles of intermittent food restrictions/refeeding and palatable food consumptions, female rats show a binge-like intake of palatable food, following a 15-min exposure to their sight and smell (\"frustration stress\"). Systemically administered OEA dose-dependently (2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg-1) prevented binge-like eating. This behavioral effect was associated with a decreased activation (measured by mapping the expression of c-fos, an early gene widely used as a marker of cellular activation) of brain areas responding to stress (such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala) and to a stimulation of areas involved in the control of food intake, such as the VTA and the PVN. These effects were paralleled, also, to the modulation of monoamine transmission in key brain areas involved in both homeostatic and hedonic control of eating. In particular, a decreased dopaminergic response to stress was observed by measuring dopamine extracellular concentrations in microdialysates from the nucleus accumbens shell, whereas an increased serotonergic and noradrenergic tone was detected in tissue homogenates of selected brain areas. Finally, a decrease in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA levels was induced by OEA in the central amygdala, while an increase in oxytocin mRNA levels was induced in the PVN. The restoration of a normal oxytocin receptor density in the striatum paralleled the oxytocinergic stimulation produced by OEA. In conclusion, we provide evidence suggesting that OEA might represent a novel potential pharmacological target for the treatment of binge-like eating behavior.",

The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of OEA supplementation along with weight loss intervention on the expression of PPAR-α, uncoupling proteins 1and 2 (UCP1 and UCP2) genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), metabolic parameters, and anthropometric indices among obese patients with NAFLD. In this triple-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, 76 obese patients newly diagnosed with NAFLD were randomly allocated into either OEA or placebo group along with calorie-restricted diets for 12 weeks. At pre-and post-intervention phase, mRNA expression levels of PPAR-α, UCP1, and UCP2 genes in the PBMCs, serum levels of metabolic parameters as well as diet and appetite sensations were assessed. There was a significant increase in the expression levels of PPAR-α, UCP1, and UCP2 genes in the PBMCs, compared to the placebo at the endpoint. A significant decrease in the anthropometric indices, energy and carbohydrate intakes, glycemic parameters, except for hemoglobin A1c concentration was also observed in the OEA group, compared to the placebo group. OEA treatment significantly resulted in decreased serum levels of triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT/AST, increased serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and improved appetite sensations. Importantly, a significant improvement in TG, ALT, AST, ALT/AST, HDL-C levels as well as appetite sensations by OEA were under the influence of body mass index (BMI). Although liver steatosis severity was significantly reduced in both groups, the between-group differences did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.061). In conclusion, the present study, for the first time, revealed that OEA supplementation significantly improved anthropometric and metabolic risk factors related to NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) agonist that acts on the peripheral control of energy metabolism. However, its therapeutic potential and related mechanisms in hepatic glucose metabolism under type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not clear. Here, OEA treatment markedly improved glucose homeostasis in a PPARα-independent manner. OEA efficiently promoted glycogen synthesis and suppressed gluconeogenesis in mouse primary hepatocytes and liver tissue. OEA enhanced hepatic glycogen synthesis and inhibited gluconeogenesis via liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways. PPARα was not involved in the roles of OEA in the LKB1/AMPK pathways. We found that OEA exerts its antidiabetic effect by increasing glycogenesis and decreasing gluconeogenesis via the LKB1/AMPK pathway. The ability of OEA to control hepatic LKB1/AMPK pathways may serve as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of T2DM. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) exerted a potent antihyperglycemic effect in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-independent manner. OEA played an antihyperglycemic role primarily via regulation of hepatic glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis. The main molecular mechanism of OEA in regulating liver glycometabolism is activating the liver kinase B1/5' AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic plaque rupture is the major trigger of acute cardiovascular risk events, and manipulation of M1/M2 macrophage homeostasis is an effective strategy for regulating atherosclerotic plaque stability. This study was aimed to illuminate the effects of oleoylethanolamide (OEA) on macrophage polarization and plaque stability. METHODS: Macrophages derived from THP-1 were treated with OEA followed by LPS/IFN-γ, and the markers of M1, M2 macrophages were monitored by western blot, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence staining. The effect of OEA on macrophage polarization in the arch of aortic arteries was tested by immunofluorescence staining and western blot, and the plaque stability was completed by Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- mice. RESULTS: OEA treatment enhanced the expression of two classic M2 macrophage markers, macrophage mannose receptor (CD206) and transforming growth factor (TGF-β), while the expression of iNOS (M1 macrophages) was decreased in THP-1-derived macrophages. Blocking of PPARα using siRNA and inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by its inhibitor compound C attenuated the OEA-induced expression of M2 macrophage markers. In addition, OEA significantly suppressed M1, promoted M2 macrophage polarization, increased collagen content and decreased necrotic core size in atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE-/- mice, which were linked with the expression of PPARα. CONCLUSIONS: OEA improved atherosclerotic plaque stability through regulating macrophage polarization via AMPK-PPARα pathway.",

      "abstract": "Brain is a site of diabetic end-organ damage. Diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction, referred as \"diabetic encephalopathy\" (DE) has been coined for the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus showing decline in their cognitive function, especially weak episodic memory, cognitive inflexibility and poor psychomotor performance leading towards Alzheimer's disease. Current evidence supported that aberrant synapses, energy metabolism imbalance, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation are associated with cognition deficits induced by diabetes. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonist, has anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. However, the effect of OEA on DE is unknown. Therefore, we tested its influence against cognitive dysfunction in high fat diet and streptozotocin (HFD + STZ)-induced diabetic C57BL/6J and PPARα--/- mice using Morris water maze (MWM) test. Neuron staining, dementia markers and neuroplasticity in the hippocampus were assessed to evaluate the neuropathological changes. The results showed that chronic OEA treatment significantly lowered hyperglycemia, recovered cognitive performance, reduced dementia markers, and inhibited hippocampal neuron loss and neuroplasticity impairments in diabetic mice. In contrast, the changes in MWM performance and neuron loss were not observed in PPARα knockout mice via OEA administration. These results indicated that OEA may provide a potential alternative therapeutic for DE by activating PPARα signaling.",

The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) supplementation on the abundance of A. muciniphila and the dietary intakes in obese people. In this randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 60 eligible obese people were selected and divided randomly into two groups including OEA group (received two capsules containing 125 mg of OEA daily) and placebo group (received two capsules containing 125 mg of starch daily). The treatment lasted for 8 weeks. Dietary intakes were evaluated according to the three -day food record and, were analyzed by the Nutritionist 4 software. In order to evaluate the changes in the abundance of A. muciniphila bacterium, faeces samples were collected at baseline and at the end of study. The targeting of the 16S rRNA gene in A. muciniphila was measured by the quantitative real-time PCR analysis. For OEA group, the energy and carbohydrate intakes decreased significantly after adjusting for baseline values and confounder factors; (p = 0.035), the amount of carbohydrate was reported as 422.25 (SD = 103.11) gr and 368.44 (SD = 99.08) gr; (p = 0.042)), before and after the treatment, respectively. The abundance of A. muciniphila bacterium increased significantly in OEA group compared to placebo group (p < 0.001). Considering the accumulating evidence identified OEA as a novel, safe, and efficacious pharmaceutical agent increasing the abundance of A. muciniphila bacterium and modifying the energy balance, therefore it is suggested to use its supplement for treatment of the obese people. However, future studies are needed to confirm the positive results obtained in this study.",

Recently, some novel compounds have been investigated for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous PPAR-α agonist, has exhibited a plethora of pharmacological properties for the treatment of obesity and other obesity-associated metabolic complications. This systematic review was performed with a focus on the effects of OEA on the risk factors for NAFLD. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases were searched up to December 2018 using relevant keywords. All articles written in English evaluating the effects of OEA on the risk factors for NAFLD were eligible for the review. The evidence reviewed in this article illustrates that OEA regulates multiple biological processes associated with NAFLD, including lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and energy homeostasis through different mechanisms. In summary, many beneficial effects of OEA have led to the understanding that OEA may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the management of NAFLD. Although a wide range of studies have demonstrated the most useful effects of OEA on NAFLD and the associated risk factors, further clinical trials, from both in vivo studies and in vitro experiments, are warranted to verify these outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator involved in the control of feeding, body weight, and energy metabolism. However, whether OEA modulates maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) has never been addressed. Hence, we evaluated the effect of OEA on DCs maturation in bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) in four aspects: (a) Cell surface markers were determined using flow cytometric analysis; (b) cell mobile ability was testified with the transwell assay; (c) stimulation of T cells proliferation was performed in a coculture system; and (d) cytokine production was measured using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The result showed that, in mature BMDCs induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the OEA treatment decreased expressions of cell surface markers, reduced cell migration, diminished the proliferation of cocultured T cells, and regulated cytokine production of BMDCs, indicating the modulatory effect of OEA on DCs maturation. Furthermore, to explore the underlying mechanism of the immunomodulatory effect of OEA, we used antagonists of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), determined the protein expressions of TRPV1/AMPK and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) using western blot, and measured the intracellular calcium concentration using calcium imaging. The result illustrated that OEA downregulated TLR4/NF-κB, the classical pathway leading to DCs maturation induced by LPS, through the activation of TRPV1 and AMPK. Collectively, the present study suggests that OEA suppresses DCs maturation through the activation of TRPV1/AMPK. These findings increase our understanding of this endogenous lipid OEA.",

      "abstract": "Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a non-cannabinoid acylethanolamide with multiple physiological roles that has been proposed to have antidepressant-like activity in preclinical models. OEA shares biosynthetic pathways with anandamide (AEA) a transmitter involved in affective disorders and anxiety in humans. However, although the participation of OEA in depression has been proposed, both, the contribution of OEA to the depressive phenotype and the effect of antidepressant therapy on circulating levels of this and related non-cannabinoid acylethanolamides in humans are basically unknown. The main objective of this study is to compare the plasma concentrations of OEA and related acylethanolamides in a sample of primary care patients with depression (n = 69) with those of healthy non-depressed patients (n = 47). At the time of admission to the study, 22 patients were under selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant treatment and 47 patients were not receiving any type of intervention. In addition, plasma concentrations of the endocannabinoid 2-AG and two related monoacylglycerols were monitored. Plasma OEA concentrations were found to be elevated in depressed patients and to correlate with somatic symptoms of depression. Plasma concentrations of both, AEA and 2-AG, were found to be elevated also in depressed patients. Further analysis demonstrated that the elevation observed in the plasma concentrations of both, OEA and 2-AG, was associated to SSRI antidepressant therapy at the time of recruitment. Further clinical research is needed to understand whether SSRI-induced elevations in OEA levels contribute to the response to SSRI in depressed patients as described in preclinical models.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is the main underlying cause of most cardiovascular diseases, and monocyte migrating to the vascular wall and subsequently differentiating into macrophage are critical steps in the process of atherosclerosis. The goal of this study was to clarify the effect of oleoylethanolamide (OEA) on monocyte migration and subsequent macrophage formation in the vascular wall. METHODS: We studied OEA in two monocyte-migrating systems in vitro: one was a single cell system whereby monocytes were exposed to OEA directly; the other was a co-culture system whereby monocytes were exposed to OEA-treated macrophages. The effect of OEA on macrophage content in the vascular wall in vivo was measured in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-/- mice by CD68 immunohistochemistry. The protein and mRNA expressions with OEA treatment were examined using western blot and real-time PCR. RESULTS: Interestingly, OEA possessed dual-directional regulation of monocyte chemotaxis in vitro, with a stimulatory effect in the single cell system and a suppressive effect in the co-culture system. And OEA restrained macrophage deposition in the vascular wall of apoE-/- mice. The underlying mechanism of OEA suppressing monocyte migration in the co-culture system was that OEA increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) level, and decreased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) level in macrophages, which was reinforced by the in vivo experiment. CONCLUSIONS: OEA restrains excessive macrophage formation in the progressive lesion by inhibiting MCP-1 production of the existent macrophages through the AMPK/PPARα/STAT3 pathway.",

When administered exogenously, OEA has beneficial effects in several cognitive paradigms; therefore, in all respects, OEA can be considered a hormone of the gut-brain axis. Here we report an unexplored modulatory effect of OEA on the intestinal microbiota and on immune response. Our study shows for the first time that sub-chronic OEA administration to mice fed a normal chow pellet diet, changes the faecal microbiota profile, shifting the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio in favour of Bacteroidetes (in particular Bacteroides genus) and decreasing Firmicutes (Lactobacillus), and reduces intestinal cytokines expression by immune cells isolated from Peyer's patches. Our results suggest that sub-chronic OEA treatment modulates gut microbiota composition towards a \"lean-like phenotype\", and polarises gut-specific immune responses mimicking the effect of a diet low in fat and high in polysaccharides content.",

Obesity has been recognized as a chronic low-grade inflammation disorder. Altered endocannabinoid system tone is also involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of oleoylethanolamide supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers and oxidative stress in obese people. Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out on 60 healthy obese people in 2016 in Tabriz, Iran. Eligible subjects were randomly divided into intervention (received daily, two 125 mg OEA capsules) and control groups (the same amounts of starch) and treated for 8 weeks. Blood samples (5 ml) were taken in fasting state at the baseline and at the end of the study. The concentrations of MDA and TAS were measured using a spectrophotometer. A high sensitive-C reactive protein level was measured by Immunoturbidimetry assay using the commercial kit. IL-6 and TNF-α levels were assayed by the ELISA method. The differences between groups were assessed by ANCOVA and statistical significance was determined at p<0.05. Results: Analysis was done on 56 participants who continued intervention until the end of the study. A significant decrease in the IL-6 and TNF-α serum concentrations was observed in the intervention group (p<0.001). Changes in other variables were undetectable (p>0.05). Conclusion: The use of OEA as a complementary pharmacotherapy agent could be effective in improving inflammation and oxidative stress in obese people. Future studies are needed to confirm the obtained results."

The main objective was to determine if targeting peroxisomal function could be of therapeutic value in GWI. We performed a pilot study that showed accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), which are metabolized in peroxisomes, in plasma from veterans with GWI. We then examined if targeting peroxisomal β-oxidation with oleoylethanolamide (OEA) restores these lipids to the normal levels and mitigates neuroinflammation and neurobehavioral deficits in a well-established mouse model of GWI. In GWI mice, treatment with OEA corresponded with cognitive benefits and reduced fatigue and disinhibition-like behavior in GWI mice. Biochemical and molecular analysis of the brain tissue showed reduced astroglia and microglia staining, decreased levels of chemokines and cytokines, and decreased NFκB phosphorylation. Treatment with OEA reduced accumulation of peroxisome specific VLCFA in the brains of GWI mice. These studies further support the translational value of targeting peroxisomes. We expect that OEA may be a potential therapy for treating neurobehavioral symptoms and the underlying lipid dysfunction and neuroinflammation associated with GWI. Oleoylethanolamide is available as a dietary supplement, making it appealing for human translational studies.",

      "abstract": "Long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) agonists (GLP-1RA), such as exendin-4 (Ex4), promote weight loss. On the basis of a newly discovered interaction between GLP-1 and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), we tested whether OEA enhances GLP-1RA-mediated anorectic signaling and weight loss. We analyzed the effect of GLP-1+OEA and Ex4+OEA on canonical GLP-1R signaling and other proteins/pathways that contribute to the hypophagic action of GLP-1RA (AMPK, Akt, mTOR, and glycolysis). We demonstrate that OEA enhances canonical GLP-1R signaling when combined with GLP-1 but not with Ex4. GLP-1 and Ex4 promote phosphorylation of mTOR pathway components, but OEA does not enhance this effect. OEA synergistically enhanced GLP-1- and Ex4-stimulated glycolysis but did not augment the hypophagic action of GLP-1 or Ex4 in lean or diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. However, the combination of Ex4+OEA promoted greater weight loss in DIO mice than Ex4 or OEA alone during a 7-day treatment. This was due in part to transient hypophagia and increased energy expenditure, phenotypes also observed in Ex4-treated DIO mice. Thus, OEA augments specific GLP-1RA-stimulated signaling but appears to work in parallel with Ex4 to promote weight loss in DIO mice. Elucidating cooperative mechanisms underlying Ex4+OEA-mediated weight loss could, therefore, be leveraged toward more effective obesity therapies.",

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out on 60 healthy obese people in Tabriz, Iran, in 2016. The eligible subjects were divided into an intervention group (who received two 125 mg OEA capsules daily) and a placebo group (who received the same amount of starches) and treated for 60 days. Anthropometric measurements and body composition were assessed in a fasting state at baseline and at the end of the study. The visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to assess appetite sensations. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis targeting the 16S rRNA gene of PPAR-α was done. Analysis was done on 56 participants who continued intervention until the end of the study. A significant increase in PPAR-α gene expression was observed in the intervention group (p < 0.001). Weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and fat percent decreased significantly at the end of the study in the intervention group (all p < 0.01). Hunger, the desire to eat, and cravings for sweet foods decreased significantly and fullness increased significantly by the end of study in the intervention group at the end of study (all p < 0.01). The fullness item increased significantly by the end of study in the intervention group (p < 0.001).

      "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration are crucial events in the pathological course of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a bioactive lipid amide released upon dietary fat digestion with many reported actions. However, the effect of OEA on restenosis after vascular injury remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of OEA on intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury in vivo, its effect on VSMC proliferation and migration induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation in vitro, and the underlying mechanism underlying these effects. The results showed that OEA-treated rats displayed a significant reduction in neointima formation after balloon injury. In cultured VSMCs, treatment with OEA decreased cell proliferation and migration induced by PDGF. OEA treatment both in vivo and in vitro led to an increase in adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), and a decrease in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclinD1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK and PPARα reversed the suppressive effects of OEA on VSMC proliferation and migration, suggesting that the suppressive effect of OEA on VSMC proliferation and migration is mediated through the activation of AMPK and PPARα. In conclusion, our present study demonstrated that OEA attenuated neointima formation in response to balloon injury by suppressing SMC proliferation and migration through an AMPK and PPARα-dependent mechanism. Our data suggests that OEA may be a potential therapeutic agent for restenosis after PCI.",

OEA is synthesized from membrane glycerophospholipids and is a high-affinity agonist of the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α). Dietary intake of oleic acid elevates circulating levels of OEA in humans by increasing substrate availability for OEA biosynthesis. Numerous clinical studies demonstrate a beneficial relationship between high-oleic acid diets and body composition, with emerging evidence to suggest OEA may mediate this response through modulation of lipid metabolism and energy intake. OEA exposure has been shown to stimulate fatty acid uptake, lipolysis, and β-oxidation, and also promote food intake control. Future research on high-oleic acid diets and body composition is warranted to confirm these outcomes and elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which oleic acid exerts its biological effects. These findings have significant practical implications, as the oleic acid-derived OEA molecule may be a promising therapeutic agent for weight management and obesity treatment.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a pandemic, gateway disease that has thrived in modern, sedentary, high calorie-eating societies. Left unchecked, obesity and obesity-related diseases will continue to plague future generations with heavy burdens on economies, healthcare systems, and the quality of life of billions. There is a significant need to elucidate basic physiological mechanisms and therapies that address this global health care crisis. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endocannabinoid-like lipid that induces hypophagia and reduces fat mass in rodents. For over a decade, PPAR-α has been the most widely accepted mediator of the hypophagic action of OEA via signaling to homeostatic brain centers. Recent evidence suggests that OEA may also reduce food intake via effects on dopamine and endocannabinoid signaling within hedonic brain centers. Limited study of OEA supplementation in humans has provided some encouraging insight into OEA-based weight loss therapy, but more thorough, controlled investigations are needed. As a potential link between homeostatic and hedonic regulation of food intake, OEA is a prime starting point for the development of more effective obesity therapies.",

Since we previously demonstrated that acute treatment with OEA in goldfish resulted in decreased food intake and locomotor activity, as in mammals, we hypothesize that OEA would be involved in the control of energy metabolism in fish. Therefore, we assessed the effects of acute (for 6 h) and chronic (for 11 days) treatments with OEA (5 µg g-1 body mass) on metabolite concentrations and enzyme activities related to glucose and lipid metabolism in liver of goldfish (Carassius auratus). In the chronic treatment, OEA impairs the increase in body mass and reduces locomotor activity, without any signs of stress. The lipolytic capacity in liver decreased after both acute and chronic OEA treatments, whereas lipogenic capacity increased after acute and decreased after chronic treatment with OEA. These results are different from those observed to date in mammalian adipose tissue, but not so different from those known in liver, and might be attributed to the absence of changes in the expression of pparα, and/or to the increase in the expression of the clock gene bmal1a after chronic OEA treatment. As for glucose metabolism, a clear decrease in the capacity of hepatic tissue to use glucose was observed in OEA-treated fish. These results support an important role for OEA in the regulation of liver lipid and glucose metabolism, and could relate to the metabolic changes associated with circadian activity and the regulation of food intake in fish.",

      "abstract": "Histaminergic neurons in the hypothalamic tuberomamillary nucleus (TMN) establish connections with virtually all brain areas. Recent evidence suggests that feeding-related motivation is correlated with the activation of a subpopulation of histamine neurons in the ventral TMN that project to hypothalamic and subcortical areas controlling feeding behaviour. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a hypophagic lipid-amide released by the small intestine in response to daily fat intake that indirectly activates hypothalamic oxytocin-neurons in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei. We recently showed that OEA requires the integrity of neuronal histamine to fully display its hypophagic effect. Here we aimed to investigate if differences exist in OEA-induced c-Fos expression in several brain regions of fasted, histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-KO mice that do not synthesize histamine, and wild type (WT) littermates. All the brain regions examined receive histaminergic innervation and are involved in different aspects of feeding behaviour. We found that OEA increased c-Fos expression in the SON, arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the amygdala of WT mice, but not HDC-KO mice, whereas neither genotype nor treatment differences were observed in the lateral and dorsomedial hypothalamus. Furthermore, oxytocin-immunostaining was markedly increased in the neurohypophysis of WT and not in HDC-KO mice. Of note, OEA increased c-Fos expression in the nucleus of solitary tract of both genotypes. Our findings suggest that the TMN serves as a relay station to elaborate peripheral signals that control homeostatic and adaptive behavioural responses.",

Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min followed by reperfusion. OEA (40 mg/kg, ip) was administered with a single injection upon reperfusion. The number of apoptotic cells was detected by TUNEL staining. The expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and TLR4, as well as the activities of NF-κB, Akt, and ERK1/2 were analyzed by western blot. Our data showed that OEA treatment alleviated cell apoptosis in a mouse model of ischemic stroke, accompanied by suppression of Bax, as well as upregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 level. The changes of Bax and Bcl-2 could not be observed in PPARα knockout mice models with OEA administration. Importantly, OEA inhibited MCAO-induced TLR4 expression, NF-κB activation, IκBα degradation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of OEA on cerebral ischemia may be attributed to its antiapoptotic property achieved, at least in part, through the PPARα signaling and inhibition of both TLR4/NF-κB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. These results provide new evidence indicating the neuroprotective effect of OEA on ischemic stroke.",

However, OEA is rapidly eliminated by hydrolysis in vivo, limiting its therapeutic potential. We hypothesize that packing OEA within a nanoparticulate system such as cubosomes, which can be used to target the blood-brain barrier (BBB), will protect it against hydrolysis and enable therapeutic concentrations to reach the brain. Cubosomes are lipid-based nanoparticles with a unique bicontinuous cubic phase internal structure. In the present study, the incorporation and chemical stability of OEA in cubosomes was investigated. Cubosomes containing OEA had a mean particle size of less than 200 nm with low polydispersity (polydispersity index <0.25). Infrared spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography showed chemical stability and the encapsulation of OEA within cubosomes. Cryo-TEM and SAXS measurements were used to probe the influence of the addition of OEA on the internal structure of the cubosomes. Up to 30% w/w OEA (relative to phytantriol) could be incorporated into phytantriol cubosomes without any significant disruption of the nanostructure of the cubosomes. Combined, the results indicate that OEA-loaded cubosomes have the potential for application as a colloidal carrier for OEA, potentially preventing hydrolysis in vivo.",

      "abstract": "Acylethanolamides are a family of endogenous lipid mediators that are involved in physiological and behavioral processes associated with addiction. Recently, oleoylethanolamide (OEA) has been reported to reduce alcohol intake and relapse in rodents but the contribution of OEA and other acylethanolamides in alcohol addiction in humans is unknown. The present study is aimed to characterize the plasma acylethanolamides in alcohol dependence. Seventy-nine abstinent alcohol-dependent subjects (27 women) recruited from outpatient treatment programs and age-/sex-/body mass-matched healthy volunteers (28 women) were clinically assessed with the diagnostic interview PRISM according to the DSM-IV-TR after blood extraction for quantification of acylethanolamide concentrations in the plasma. Our results indicate that all acylethanolamides were significantly increased in alcohol-dependent patients compared with control subjects (p < 0.001). A logistic model based on these acylethanolamides was developed to distinguish alcohol-dependent patients from controls and included OEA, arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) and docosatetraenoylethanolamide (DEA), providing a high discriminatory power according to area under the curve [AUC = 0.92 (95%CI: 0.87-0.96), p < 0.001]. Additionally, we found a significant effect of the duration of alcohol abstinence on the concentrations of OEA, AEA and DEA using a regression model (p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively), which was confirmed by a negative correlation (rho = -0.31, -0.40 and -0.44, respectively). However, acylethanolamides were not influenced by the addiction alcohol severity, duration of problematic alcohol use or diagnosis of psychiatric comorbidity. Our results support the preclinical studies and suggest that OEA, AEA and DEA are altered in alcohol-dependence during abstinence and that might act as potential markers for predicting length of alcohol abstinence.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol abuse is frequently characterized by a specific pattern of intake in binge drinking episodes, inducing neuroinflammation and brain damage. Here, we characterized the temporal profile of neuroinflammation in rats exposed to intragastric binge ethanol administrations (3 times/day × 4 days) and tested the anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective properties of the satiety factor oleoylethanolamide (OEA). Pre-treatment with OEA (5 mg/kg, i.p.) previous each alcohol gavage blocked the expression of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) danger signal and the innate immunity Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) in frontal cortex, and inhibited the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) proinflammatory cascade induced by alcohol binge administration. OEA reduced the levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and the enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in ethanol binged animals. Elevations in plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-1β after ethanol were also inhibited by OEA. OEA also prevented ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation, caspase-8 and pro-apoptotic caspase-3 activation in frontal cortex. Additionally, OEA blocked the rise in blood corticosterone levels after ethanol with no alteration in blood ethanol levels and may affect ethanol-induced gut permeability for endotoxin. Finally, OEA, administered as a pre-treatment during the ethanol binge, exerted antidepressant-like effects during acute withdrawal. Altogether, results highlight a beneficial profile of OEA as a potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective and antidepressant-like compound to treat alcohol abuse.",

In present study, we further investigated the activities and mechanisms of OEA in ameliorating hepatic fibrosis in Sv/129 mice induced by a methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet or thioacetamide (TAA) treatment. Liver fibrosis development was assessed by Hematoxylin-eosin and Sirius red staining. Treatment with OEA (5 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal injection, i.p.) significantly attenuated the progress of liver fibrosis in both two experimental animal models by blocking the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Gene expression analysis of hepatic tissues indicated that OEA inhibited the expression of α-smooth muscle action (α-SMA) and collagen matrix, fibrosis markers, and genes involved in inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling. In vitro studies showed that OEA inhibited transforming growth factor β1-stimulated HSCs activation through suppressing Smad2/3 phosphorylation, α-SMA expression and myofibroblast transformation. These improvements could not be observed in PPAR-α knockout mice models with OEA administration, which suggested all the anti-fibrotic effects of OEA in vivo and in vitro were mediated by PPAR-α activation. Collectively, our results suggested that OEA exerted a pharmacological effect on modulating hepatic fibrosis development through the inhibition of HSCs activation in liver and therefore may be a potential therapeutic agent for liver fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "The spread of \"obesity epidemic\" and the poor efficacy of many anti-obesity therapies in the long-term highlight the need to develop novel efficacious therapy. This necessity stimulates a large research effort to find novel mechanisms controlling feeding and energy balance. Among these mechanisms a great deal of attention has been attracted by a family of phospholipid-derived signaling molecules that play an important role in the regulation of food-intake. They include N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) and N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs). NAPEs have been considered for a long time simply as phospholipid precursors of the lipid mediator NAEs, but increasing body of evidence suggest a role in many physiological processes including the regulation of feeding behavior. Several observations demonstrated that among NAEs, oleoylethanolamide (OEA) acts as a satiety signal, which is generated in the intestine, upon the ingestion of fat, and signals to the central nervous system. At this level different neuronal pathways, including oxytocinergic, noradrenergic, and histaminergic neurons, seem to mediate its hypophagic action. Similarly to NAEs, NAPE (with particular reference to the N16:0 species) levels were shown to be regulated by the fed state and this finding was initially interpreted as fluctuations of NAE precursors. However, the observation that exogenously administered NAPEs are able to inhibit food intake, not only in normal rats and mice but also in mice lacking the enzyme that converts NAPEs into NAEs, supported the hypothesis of a role of NAPE in the regulation of feeding behavior. Indirect observations suggest that the hypophagic action of NAPEs might involve central mechanisms, although the molecular target remains unknown. The present paper reviews the role that OEA and NAPEs play in the mechanisms that control food intake, further supporting this group of phospholipids as optimal candidate for the development of novel anti-obesity treatments."

Increasing evidence suggests that OEA may act as an endogenous neuroprotective factor and participate in the control of mental disorder-related behaviors. In this study, we examined whether OEA is effective against depression and investigated the role of circulating endogenous acylethanolamides during stress. Mice were subjected to 28days of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and during the last 21days, treated with oral OEA (1.5-6mg/kg) or 6mg/kg fluoxetine. Sucrose preference and open field test activity were used to evaluate depression-like behaviors during CUMS and after OEA treatment. Weights of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined, and the adrenal index was measured. Furthermore, changes in serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were detected. Our findings indicate that OEA normalized sucrose preferences, locomotion distances, rearing frequencies, prefrontal cortex and hippocampal atrophy, and adrenal indices. In addition, OEA reversed the abnormalities of BDNF and MDA levels and SOD activities in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, as well as changes in serum levels of ACTH, CORT, and T-AOC. The antidepressant effects of OEA may be related to the regulation of BDNF levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, antioxidant defenses, and normalizing hyperactivity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA).",

To assess whether OEA can also regulate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) caused by fat accumulation, we administrated OEA or fenofibrate in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats fed with a high fat diet (HFD). After 6 or 17 weeks treatment, OEA (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) relieved the development of NAFLD compared with control groups by regulating the levels of plasma TG, TC, ALT and AST and liver inflammatory cytokines. Gene expression analysis of liver tissue and plasma from the animal models showed that OEA and fenofibrate both promoted the lipid β-oxidation by activating PPAR-α. Detailed research revealed that OEA inhibited the mRNA expression of lipogenesis in a PPAR-α-independant manner, while fenofibrate expressed an opposite effection. In summary, our research results suggested that as a potential lead compound, OEA could improve HFD-induced NAFLD with higher efficacy and safety than fenofibrate.",

The immobility was used to evaluate depressive-like behaviors in tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). ELISA detected changes in cerebral noradrenaline (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) levels. Likewise, in the drug-induced model of depression, OEA was given once daily at 10mg/kg (p.o.) for 7 consecutive days. Then, the mice received reserpine (4 mg/kg, i.p.) and the rectal temperature was measured at different time points. Consequently, head twitch behavior induced by intraperitoneal injection of 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP; 300 mg/kg) were determined. The experimental data showed that OEA (2.5-10mg/kg) treatment significantly decreased the immobility as compared to the control group, and OEA (10mg/kg) treatment significantly increased 5-HTP-induced head twitch behavior and reversed reserpine-induced hypothermia and increased cerebral levels of NE and 5-HT. Thus, the antidepressant effects of OEA may be related to regulating central monoamine neurotransmitters.",

DESIGN: Biochemical and physiological studies of human seminal plasma and spermatozoa. SETTING: Academic tertiary care medical center. PATIENT(S): Ninety men attending an infertility clinic for semen analysis. INTERVENTION(S): Palmitoylethanolamide and OEA extracted from seminal plasma were quantified by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry. Patient sperm from semen with normal parameters were exposed in vitro to PEA or OEA to determine effects on sperm motility, viability, and mitochondrial activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The relationship between seminal plasma concentrations of PEA and OEA and sperm quality and the effect of these compounds on sperm motility, viability, and mitochondria activity in vitro. RESULT(S): Palmitoylethanolamide and OEA concentrations in seminal plasma were lower in men with asthenozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozospermia compared with men with normal semen parameters. Palmitoylethanolamide and OEA rapidly and significantly improved sperm motility and maintained viability without affecting mitochondria activity in vitro. CONCLUSION(S): Maintenance of normal PEA and OEA tone in human seminal plasma may be necessary for the preservation of normal sperm function and male fertility. Exocannabinoids found in Cannabis, such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, could compete with these endocannabinoids upsetting their finely balanced, normal functioning and resulting in male reproductive failure.",

      "abstract": "Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a bioactive lipid mediator, produced in the intestine and other tissues, which is involved in energy balance regulation in mammals, modulating feeding and lipid metabolism. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the presence and possible role of OEA in feeding regulation in goldfish (Carassius auratus). We assessed whether goldfish peripheral tissues and brain contain OEA and their regulation by nutritional status. OEA was detected in all studied tissues (liver, intestinal bulb, proximal intestine, muscle, hypothalamus, telencephalon and brainstem). Food deprivation (48 h) reduced intestinal OEA levels and levels increased upon re-feeding, suggesting that this compound may be involved in the short-term regulation of food intake in goldfish, as a satiety factor. Next, the effects of acute intraperitoneal administration of OEA on feeding, swimming and plasma levels of glucose and triglycerides were analysed. Food intake, swimming activity and circulating triglyceride levels were reduced by OEA 2 h post-injection. Finally, the possible interplay among OEA and other feeding regulators (leptin, cholecystokinin, ghrelin, neuropeptide Y, orexin and monoamines) was investigated. OEA actions on energy homeostasis in goldfish could be mediated, at least in part, through interactions with ghrelin and the serotonergic system, as OEA treatment reduced ghrelin expression in the intestinal bulb, and increased serotonergic activity in the telencephalon. In summary, our results indicate for the first time in fish that OEA could be involved in the regulation of feeding, swimming and lipid metabolism, suggesting a high conservation of OEA actions in energy balance throughout vertebrate evolution.",

      "abstract": "The initial pharmaceutical interest for the endocannabinoid system as a target for antiobesity therapies has been restricted by the severe adverse effects of the CB1 antagonist rimonabant. This study points at oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a monounsaturated analogue, and functional antagonist of anandamide, as a potential and safer antiobesity alternative to CB1 antagonism. Mice treated with equal doses (5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) of OEA or rimonabant were analyzed for the progressive expression of spontaneous behaviors (eating, grooming, rearing, locomotion, and resting) occurring during the development of satiety, according to the paradigm called behavioral satiety sequence (BSS). Both drugs reduced food (wet mash) intake to a similar extent. OEA treatment decreased eating activity within the first 30 min and caused a temporary increase of resting time that was not accompanied by any decline of horizontal, vertical and total motor activity. Besides decreasing eating activity, rimonabant caused a marked increase of the time spent grooming and decreased horizontal motor activity, alterations that might be indicative of aversive nonmotivational effects on feeding. These results support the idea that OEA suppresses appetite by stimulating satiety and that its profile of action might be predictive of safer effects in humans as a novel antiobesity treatment.",

      "abstract": "Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and has been described to exhibit neuroprotective properties when administered locally in animal models of several neurological disorder models, including stroke and Parkinson's disease. However, there is little information regarding the effectiveness of systemic administration of OEA on Parkinson's disease. In the present study, OEA-mediated neuroprotection has been tested on in vivo and in vitro models of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OH-DA)-induced degeneration. The in vivo model was based on the intrastriatal infusion of the neurotoxin 6-OH-DA, which generates Parkinsonian symptoms. Rats were treated 2 h before and after the 6-OH-DA treatment with systemic OEA (0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg). The Parkinsonian symptoms were evaluated at 1 and 4 wk after the development of lesions. The functional status of the nigrostriatal system was studied through tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1, oxidation marker) immunostaining as well as by monitoring the synaptophysin content. In vitro cell cultures were also treated with OEA and 6-OH-DA. As expected, our results revealed 6-OH-DA induced neurotoxicity and behavioural deficits; however, these alterations were less severe in the animals treated with the highest dose of OEA (5 mg/kg). 6-OH-DA administration significantly reduced the striatal TH-immunoreactivity (ir) density, synaptophysin expression, and the number of nigral TH-ir neurons. Moreover, 6-OH-DA enhanced striatal HO-1 content, which was blocked by OEA (5 mg/kg). In vitro, 0.5 and 1 μM of OEA exerted significant neuroprotection on cultured nigral neurons. These effects were abolished after blocking PPARα with the selective antagonist GW6471. In conclusion, systemic OEA protects the nigrostriatal circuit from 6-OH-DA-induced neurotoxicity through a PPARα-dependent mechanism.",

      "abstract": "β-adrenergic receptor activation promotes brown adipose tissue (BAT) β-oxidation and thermogenesis by burning fatty acids during uncoupling respiration. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) can inhibit feeding and stimulate lipolysis by activating peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor-α (PPARα) in white adipose tissue (WAT). Here we explore whether PPARα activation potentiates the effect of β3-adrenergic stimulation on energy balance mediated by the respective agonists OEA and CL316243. The effect of this pharmacological association on feeding, thermogenesis, β-oxidation, and lipid and cholesterol metabolism in epididymal (e)WAT was monitored. CL316243 (1 mg/kg) and OEA (5 mg/kg) co-administration over 6 days enhanced the reduction of both food intake and body weight gain, increased the energy expenditure and reduced the respiratory quotient (VCO2/VO2). This negative energy balance agreed with decreased fat mass and increased BAT weight and temperature, as well as with lowered plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, nonessential fatty acids (NEFAs), and the adipokines leptin and TNF-α. Regarding eWAT, CL316243 and OEA treatment elevated levels of the thermogenic factors PPARα and UCP1, reduced p38-MAPK phosphorylation, and promoted brown-like features in the white adipocytes: the mitochondrial (Cox4i1, Cox4i2) and BAT (Fgf21, Prdm16) genes were overexpressed in eWAT. The enhancement of the fatty-acid β-oxidation factors Cpt1b and Acox1 in eWAT was accompanied by an upregulation of de novo lipogenesis and reduced expression of the unsaturated-fatty-acid-synthesis enzyme gene, Scd1. We propose that the combination of β-adrenergic and PPARα receptor agonists promotes therapeutic adipocyte remodelling in eWAT, and therefore has a potential clinical utility in the treatment of obesity.",

Increasing evidences suggest that the endocannabinoid system may play a role in the modulation of dyskinesias. In this work, we assessed the antidyskinetic effect of the endocannabinoid analog oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an agonist of PPARα and antagonist of TRPV1 receptors. We used a hemiparkinsonian model of PD in mice with 6-OHDA striatal lesion. The chronic L-DOPA treatment developed intense axial, forelimb and orolingual dyskinetic symptoms, as well as contralateral rotations. Treatment with OEA reduced all these symptoms without reducing motor activity or the therapeutic motor effects of L-DOPA. Moreover, the OEA-induced reduction in dyskinetic behavior correlated with a reduction in molecular correlates of dyskinesia. OEA reduced FosB striatal overexpression and phosphoacetylation of histone 3, both molecular markers of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. We found that OEA antidyskinetic properties were mediated by TRPV1 receptor, as pretreatment with capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, blocked OEA antidyskinetic actions, as well as the reduction in FosB- and pAcH3-overexpression induced by L-DOPA. This study supports the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system plays an important role in the development and expression of dyskinesias and might be an effective target for the treatment of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Importantly, there was no development of tolerance to OEA in any of the parameters we examined, which has important implications for the therapeutic potential of drugs targeting the endocannabinoid system.",

This effect, which requires intact vagal fibers and intestinal PPAR-alpha receptors, is coupled to the increase of c-fos and oxytocin mRNA expression in neurons of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and is prevented by the intracerebroventricular administration of a selective oxytocin antagonist, thus suggesting a necessary role of oxytocinergic neurotransmission in the pro-satiety effect of OEA. By brain microdialysis and immunohistochemistry, in this study we demonstrate that OEA treatment can stimulate oxytocin neurosecretion from the PVN and enhance oxytocin expression at both axonal and somatodendritic levels of hypothalamic neurons. Such effects, which are maximum 2h after OEA administration, support the hypothesis that the satiety-inducing action of OEA is mediated by the activation of oxytocin hypothalamic neurons.",

      "abstract": "We have modelled elaidyl-sulfamide (ES), a sulfamoyl analogue of oleoylethanolamide (OEA). ES is a lipid mediator of satiety that works through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). We have characterised the pharmacological profile of ES (0.3-3 mg/kg body weight) by means of in silico molecular docking to the PPARα receptor, in vitro transcription through PPARα, and in vitro and in vivo administration to obese rats. ES interacts with the binding site of PPARα in a similar way as OEA does, is capable of activating PPARα and also reduces feeding in a dose-dependent manner when administered to food-deprived rats. When ES was given to obese male rats for 7 days, it reduced feeding and weight gain, lowered plasma cholesterol and reduced the plasmatic activity of transaminases, indicating a clear improvement of hepatic function. This pharmacological profile is associated with the modulation of both cholesterol and lipid metabolism regulatory genes, including the sterol response element-binding proteins SREBF1 and SREBF2, and their regulatory proteins INSIG1 and INSIG2, in liver and white adipose tissues. ES treatment induced the expression of thermogenic regulatory genes, including the uncoupling proteins UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3 in brown adipose tissue and UCP3 in white adipose tissue. However, its chronic administration resulted in hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance, which represent a constraint for its potential clinical development.",

The objective of the present work is to show if this molecule modifies the sleep-waking cycle through central mechanisms. We have found that the peripheral administration of OEA reduces food intake and increases waking with a concomitant reduction of rapid eye movement sleep. Additionally, this treatment produces deactivation of the lateral hypothalamus, as inferred from the c-Fos expression evaluation. Finally, intra-lateral hypothalamus injection of OEA has mirrored the effects induced by this molecule when it is peripherally administered. In conclusion, we show for the very first time that OEA can modify the sleep-waking cycle and food intake, apparently mediated by the lateral hypothalamus.",

In this study, we examined whether the endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) agonist, oleoylethanolamide (OEA) protects against these MDMA-induced deficits. Mice were pretreated twice a day with OEA (0, 5, and 25 mg/kg) 30 min before an injection of MDMA (30 mg/kg) or saline during four consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, animals were trained in an active avoidance task for two consecutive weeks. After a 5-day resting period, a recall session was performed. Mice treated with MDMA showed reduced learning and recall of the task when compared with saline-treated controls. OEA at 5 mg/kg ameliorated and at 25 mg/kg worsened this deficit. Dopamine transporter (DAT)-binding sites significantly decreased 4 days after the last MDMA administration and pretreatment with both doses of OEA prevented this effect. In immunohistochemical studies, coexpression of tyrosine-hydroxylase and PPAR-alpha receptors was observed in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta of mice. These results suggest that OEA administration can modulate the cognitive deficits induced by MDMA in a DAT-independent manner.",

      "abstract": "Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) has been previously reported to regulate food intake and body weight gain when administered intraperitoneally. Nevertheless, little information is available with regard to oral administration. To assess whether oral OEA can also exert a similar effect on body fat, we fed C3H mice a high-fat diet supplemented with either 10 or 100 mg/kg body weight OEA for 4 weeks. OEA supplementation significantly lowered food intake over the 4 weeks and decreased adipose tissue mass. Plasma triglyceride levels were also significantly decreased by OEA treatment. In order to identify the potential molecular targets of OEA action, we screened the expression levels of 44 genes related to body fat mass and food intake in peripheral tissues. Adipose tissue fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), intestinal fatty acid transporter/cluster of differentiation 36 and the OEA receptor G-protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119) were among the most OEA-responsive genes. They were also associated with reduced body fat pads regardless of the dose. Adipose FAAH was found to be primarily associated with a decrease in food intake. Our data suggest that the anti-obesity activity of OEA partially relies on modulation of the FAAH pathway in adipose tissue. Another mechanism might involve modulation of the newly discovered GPR119 OEA signaling pathway in the proximal intestine. In conclusion, our study indicates that oral administration of OEA can effectively decrease obesity in the mouse model and that modulation of the endocannabinoid fatty acid ethanolamide pathway seems to play an important role both in adipose tissue and in small intestine.",

The Galphas-coupled receptor GPR119 binds the long-chain fatty acid derivate oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and GPR119 agonists enhance GLP-1 secretion. We therefore hypothesized that OEA stimulates GLP-1 release through a GPR119-dependent mechanism. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Murine (m) GLUTag, human (h) NCI-H716, and primary fetal rat intestinal L-cell models were used for RT-PCR and for cAMP and GLP-1 radioimmunoassay. Anesthetized rats received intravenous or intraileal OEA, and plasma bioactive GLP-1, insulin, and glucose levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or glucose analyzer. RESULTS: GPR119 messenger RNA was detected in all L-cell models. OEA treatment (10 micromol/l) of mGLUTag cells increased cAMP levels (P < 0.05) and GLP-1 secretion (P < 0.001) in all models, with desensitization of the secretory response at higher concentrations. GLP-1 secretion was further enhanced by prevention of OEA degradation using the fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, URB597 (P < 0.05-0.001 vs. OEA alone), and was abolished by H89-induced inhibition of protein kinase A. OEA-induced cAMP levels and GLP-1 secretion were significantly reduced in mGLUTag cells transfected with GPR119-specific small interfering RNA (P < 0.05). Application of OEA (10 micromol/l) directly into the rat ileum, but not intravenously, increased plasma bioactive GLP-1 levels in euglycemic animals by 1.5-fold (P < 0.05) and insulin levels by 3.9-fold (P < 0.01) but only in the presence of hyperglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these studies demonstrate, for the first time, that OEA increases GLP-1 secretion from intestinal L-cells through activation of the novel GPR119 fatty acid derivate receptor in vitro and in vivo.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether PE-containing lipids can also inhibit intake. This was a 4 treatment intervention where 18 male participants were given a high-fat test breakfast (2.5 MJ, 53 en% fat) containing (i) high-phospholipid, high-PE lipid (ii) high-phospholipid, medium-PE lipid (iii) no-phospholipid, no-PE control lipid or (iv) water control, in a randomised cross-over. Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to assess post-ingestive hunger and satiety, and energy intake (EI) was measured at an ad libitum lunch meal after 3.5 hours. RESULTS: When compared with the water control, the 3 lipid treatments resulted in lower levels of hunger and thoughts of food, greater fullness and satisfaction (all, treatment*time interaction, P<0.001), and a lower EI (P<0.05). However, there was no difference in any of the VAS measures when the 2 PE lipid treatments were compared with no-PE control lipid, nor when medium-PE was compared with high-PE. Unexpectedly participants ate significantly more energy at the lunch meal when the 2 PE lipid treatments (medium-PE:5406 kJ, 334 sem; high-PE:5288 kJ, 244 sem) were compared with the no-PE control lipid (5072 kJ, 262 sem, P<0.05), although there was no dose effect between the medium- and high-PE treatments. CONCLUSION: Despite the close relationship of PE with OEA, there was no evidence from this acute study that dietary phospholipids containing PE can favourably modify eating behaviour.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The endocannabinoid N-arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) is co-synthesized with other N-acylethanolamides, namely N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA), which have been shown to potentiate anandamide responses (so-called 'entourage effects') in non-vascular tissues. It remains unclear whether such interactions occur in the circulation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In rat isolated small mesenteric arteries, the effects of PEA and OEA on relaxation to anandamide and tissue contents of the N-acylethanolamides were examined under myographic conditions. KEY RESULTS: Anandamide-induced relaxation was potentiated by pretreatment with PEA (10 microM) or OEA (1 microM), or in combination. The potentiation by PEA and OEA was endothelium-independent and abolished by treatment with capsaicin (10 microM), which desensitizes the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) receptor system, or by the TRPV1 receptor antagonist, N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamide (SB366791) (2 microM). It was also observed at molar ratios of anandamide and PEA (or OEA) similar to those found in mesenteric arteries. PEA and inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis by 3'-carbamoyl-biphenyl-3-yl-cyclohexylcarbamate (URB597) (1 microM) additively potentiated anandamide responses. On the other hand, PEA and OEA also induced vasorelaxation per se (rank order of potency: anandamide>OEA>PEA), but relaxation to the three N-acylethanolamides displayed different sensitivity to treatment with capsaicin, SB366791 and URB597. For example, relaxations to anandamide and OEA, but not PEA, were attenuated by both capsaicin and SB366791. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This study shows that PEA and OEA potentiate relaxant responses to anandamide through TRPV1 receptors in rat small mesenteric arteries. The congeners also induce vasorelaxation per se, suggesting a function for the N-acylethanolamides in vascular control.",

While anandamide, a cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist, promotes feeding and lipogenesis, oleoylethanolamide, an endogenous agonist of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha), decreases food intake and activates lipid mobilization and oxidation. The treatment with a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist results in reduction of body weight gain and cholesterol in obese humans and rodents. In the present study, we show the benefits of the treatment of obese Zucker rats with a combination of a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist (Rimonabant) and oleoylethanolamide. This combinational therapy improved the separate effects of Rimonabant and OEA, and resulted in marked decreases on feeding, body weight gain, and plasma cholesterol levels. Additionally, the treatment with both drugs reduced the hepatic steatosis observed in Zucker rats, decreasing liver fat deposits and damage, as revealed by the levels of alanine aminotransferase activity in serum. The combined treatment inhibits the expression of stearoyl coenzyme-A desaturase-1 (SCD-1), a pivotal enzyme in lipid biosynthesis and triglyceride mobilization that is linked to obesity phenotypes. These results support the use of combined therapies with cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists and PPAR-alpha agonists for the treatment of obesity associated with dyslipemia.",

      "abstract": "The increase in the prevalence of human obesity highlights the need to identify molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in control of feeding and energy balance. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous lipid produced primarily in the small intestine, has been identified to play an important role in the regulation of animal food intake and body weight. Previous studies indicated that OEA activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, which is required to mediate the effects of appetite suppression, reduces blood lipid levels, and enhances peripheral fatty acid catabolism. However, the effect of OEA on enterocyte function is unclear. In this study, we have examined the effect of OEA on intestinal fatty acid uptake and FAT/CD36 expression in vivo and in vitro. We intraperitoneally administered OEA to rats and examined FAT/CD36 mRNA level and fatty acid uptake in enterocytes isolated from the proximal small intestine, as well as in adipocytes. Our results indicate that OEA treatment significantly increased FAT/CD36 mRNA expression in intestinal mucosa and isolated jejunal enterocytes. In addition, we also found that OEA treatment significantly increases fatty acid uptake in isolated enterocytes in vitro. These results suggest that in addition to appetite regulation, OEA may regulate body weight by altered peripheral lipid metabolism, including increased lipolysis in adipocytes and enhanced fatty acid uptake in enterocytes, both in conjunction with increased expression of FAT/CD36. This study may have important implications in understanding the mechanism of OEA in the regulation of fatty acid absorption in human physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",

Furthermore, we have used the recombinant receptor to discover novel selective small-molecule GPR119 agonists, typified by PSN632408, which suppress food intake in rats and reduce body weight gain and white adipose tissue deposition upon subchronic oral administration to high-fat-fed rats.

An anorexic lipid mediator regulated by feeding. Nature 414, 209-212], and serves as an endogenous agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) [Fu, J., Gaetani, S., Oveisi, F., Lo Verme, J., Serrano, A., Rodriguez De Fonseca, F., Rosengarth., A., Luecke, H., Di Giacomo, B., Tarzia, G., Piomelli, D., 2003. Oleoylethanolamide regulates feeding and body weight through activation of the nuclear receptor PPAR-alpha. Nature 425, 90-93], a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates several aspects of lipid metabolism [. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: nuclear control of metabolism. Endocr. Rev. 20, 649-688]). OEA reduces food intake in wild-type mice, but not in mice deficient in PPAR-alpha (PPAR-alpha(-/-)), an effect that is also observed with the PPAR-alpha agonists Wy-14643 and GW7647 [Brown, P.J., Chapman, J.M., Oplinger, J.A., Stuart, L.W., Willson, T.M. and Wu, Z., 2000. Chemical compounds as selective activators of PPAR-alpha. PCT Int. Appl., 32; . The PPARs: from orphan receptors to drug discovery. J. Med. Chem. 43, 527-550]. By contrast, specific agonists of PPAR-delta/beta (GW501516) or PPAR-gamma (ciglitazone) have no such effect. In obese Zucker rats, which lack functional leptin receptors, OEA reduces food intake and lowers body-weight gain along with plasma lipid levels. Similar effects are seen in diet-induced obese rats and mice. In the present study, we report that subchronic OEA treatment (5mgkg(-1), intraperitoneally, i.p., once daily for two weeks) in Zucker rats initiates transcription of PPAR-alpha and other PPAR-alpha target genes, including fatty-acid translocase (FAT/CD36), liver fatty-acid binding protein (L-FABP), and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2). Moreover, OEA decreases neutral lipid content in hepatocytes, as assessed by Oil red O staining, as well as serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The results suggest that OEA regulates lipid metabolism and that this effect may contribute to its anti-obesity properties.",

      "abstract": "Amides of fatty acids with ethanolamine (FAE) are biologically active lipids that participate in a variety of biological functions, including the regulation of feeding. The polyunsaturated FAE anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide) increases food intake by activating G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors. On the other hand, the monounsaturated FAE oleoylethanolamide (OEA) reduces feeding and body weight gain by activating the nuclear receptor PPAR-alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha). In the present report, we examined whether OEA can also influence energy utilization. OEA (1-20 microm) stimulated glycerol and fatty acid release from freshly dissociated rat adipocytes in a concentration-dependent and structurally selective manner. Under the same conditions, OEA had no effect on glucose uptake or oxidation. OEA enhanced fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle strips, dissociated hepatocytes, and primary cardiomyocyte cultures. Administration of OEA in vivo (5 mg kg(-1), intraperitoneally) produced lipolysis in both rats and wild-type mice, but not in mice in which PPAR-alpha had been deleted by homologous recombination (PPAR-alpha(-/-)). Likewise, OEA was unable to enhance lipolysis in adipocytes or stimulate fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle strips isolated from PPAR-alpha mice. The synthetic PPAR-alpha agonist Wy-14643 produced similar effects, which also were dependent on the presence of PPAR-alpha. Subchronic treatment with OEA reduced body weight gain and triacylglycerol content in liver and adipose tissue of diet-induced obese rats and wild-type mice, but not in obese PPAR-alpha(-/-) mice. The results suggest that OEA stimulates fat utilization through activation of PPAR-alpha and that this effect may contribute to its anti-obesity actions.",
