      "abstract": "Inflammation represents an adaptive physiological response of body immune system to infection or tissue damage, which may be regulated by food supplementation. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has multi-functions and its anti-inflammatory effect has gained great attention. This study aimed to address the exact molecular mechanism underlying its inflammatory control. The results showed that EPA decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in RAW264.7 cells by modulating the production of cellular cytokines. In addition, EPA downregulated miR-125b-5p, which showed pro-inflammatory effect and its forced expression attenuated EPA's anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) is targeted by miR-125b-5p. CREB overexpression reduced inflammation probably via modulating the PGC-1α/NF-κB pathway, which resembled the effect of EPA pre-treatment. Therefore, EPA exhibited anti-inflammatory activity by targeting the miR-125b-5p/CREB axis, which modulated the production of inflammatory mediators probably via transcription control. This study provides insights into microRNA-mediated action mechanism and facilitates the relief of inflammation-associated diseases by food ingredients."

      "abstract": "Despite intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapies effectively reducing cardiovascular events, residual cardiovascular risks remain significant, with hypertriglyceridemia being an important contributing factor. Pemafibrate, a novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator, has shown strong triglyceride-lowering effects and potential vascular benefits. Similarly, eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (EPA) has demonstrated cardiovascular protective effects, particularly in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. However, the comparative impact of these agents on endothelial function, a key marker of atherosclerotic progression, has not been thoroughly evaluated in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The PRIME (PRospective comparIson of peMafibrate and Eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester on vascular functions for hypertriglyceridemia) trial is a multi-center, open-label, randomised trial designed to compare the effects of pemafibrate and EPA on endothelial function in patients with CAD and hypertriglyceridemia. Patients receiving statin therapy with fasting triglyceride levels ≥150 mg/dL will be randomised into two groups: pemafibrate (0.2 mg/day, with possible dose escalation to 0.4 mg/day) or EPA (1800 mg/day, with possible dose escalation to 2700 mg/day). Endothelial function will be assessed with reactive hyperemia index (RHI). The primary endpoint is the change in RHI at 12 weeks. The secondary endpoints include the changes in RHI at 24 weeks, correlations between changes in RHI and changes in lipid biomarkers, and changes in biochemical parameters at 12 and 24 weeks. This study investigates the comparative effects of pemafibrate and EPA on endothelial function, addressing an unmet need in managing residual cardiovascular risk in patients with CAD. The findings will contribute to the optimisation of treatment strategies in patients with CAD and hypertriglyceridemia."

      "abstract": "Ceramide plays a crucial role in promoting liver fibrosis by inducing apoptosis and inflammation in hepatocytes. Oxidative stress accelerates fibrosis by elevating levels of urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an indicator for the damage of DNA. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of eicosapentaenoic acid encapsulated in cellulose nanocrystals (EPA-CNC) in inhibiting ceramide accumulation and reducing urinary 8-OHdG levels, thus providing protective effects against the progression of liver fibrosis. In this study, twenty-four adult male Wistar albino rats were allocated into a negative control group, a group with liver fibrosis induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and a group with DEN-induced liver fibrosis treated simultaneously with EPA-CNC. Key parameters assessed included liver paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), plasma ceramide, liver hydroxyproline (Hyp) content, and urinary 8-OHdG. DEN-induced liver fibrosis led to a significant increase in inflammatory markers, including ceramide, IL-6, and notably urinary 8-OHdG. This was accompanied by a decrease in PON-1 activity and increased collagen deposition in liver tissues (Hyp content). Histopathological analysis revealed a substantial loss of liver architecture, with inflammation and fibrosis surrounding necrotic areas. In contrast, treatment with encapsulated EPA-CNC resulted in a significant decrease in plasma ceramide, IL-6, liver Hyp content, and urinary 8-OHdG levels, along with an improvement in liver PON-1 activity. Histopathological findings showed nearly normal liver architecture. In conclusion, increased levels of ceramide and urinary 8-OHdG could serve as indicators of ongoing hepatocellular damage due to their positive correlations with fibrotic markers. Encapsulated EPA-CNC may offer a promising approach for halting oxidative stress and inflammation in liver fibrosis."

This single-arm, phase II study assessed the potential benefit of an oral nutritional supplement containing EPA (ONS-EPA) for cachexia in AGC patients. METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive AGC patients with cachexia, defined by serum albumin < 3.5 g/dl and C-reactive protein ≥ 0.5 mg/dl, were included. Patients received an EPA-enriched supplement (Prosure®, 1.056 g EPA/pack) twice daily during first-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure (TTF) in patients adhering to ≥ 25% of the planned ONS-EPA dose in the first two weeks (per-protocol set, PPS). Secondary analyses evaluated adherence impact on treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Of 72 enrolled patients, 65 were evaluated. Median adherence was 42.8%. Median TTF in the PPS group was 4.8 months (95% CI 3.6-5.5), below the pre-set 4-month threshold. The PPS group had a higher proportion of patients who improved their nutritional and inflammatory status during treatment, along with better TTF and overall survival (OS) compared to those with poor adherence. Adjusted median TTF was 4.6 vs. 2.5 months (hazard ratio: 0.56; 95% CI 0.28-1.12, p = 0.105). CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not achieved, the study suggests that ONS-EPA may benefit AGC patients with cachexia."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Neuroblastoma is a genetically diverse, highly metastatic pediatric cancer accounting for 15% of childhood cancer deaths despite only having ~8% of childhood cancer incidence. The current standard of care for high-risk diseases is highly genotoxic. This, combined with less than 50% survival in high-risk diseases and an abysmal 5% survival in relapsed cases, makes discovering novel, effective, and less toxic treatments essential. Methods: A prophylactic syngeneic mouse model was used to test high-dose lipid-mediator highly unsaturated fatty acids on tumorigenesis. Wildtype mice were gavaged with 12.3-14.6 g/d (adult human equivalent) omega-3 EPA, DHA, or oxidation-resistant bis allylic deuterated DHA (D-DHA) and 4.6-6.0 g/d arachidonic acid (ARA). At seven days, MYCN-expressing murine neuro-2a cells syngeneic to the gavaged mice were injected subcutaneously. Oral gavage continued for 10-20 d post-injection when tumors and tissues were harvested. Results: Fifty percent of control (not gavaged) animals form tumors (4/8) at about 10 d. High-dose DHA, D-DHA, and EPA block tumor formation completely in n = 8 or 10 animals. In contrast, ω6 arachidonic acid (4.6-6.0 g/d) enhances tumor formation (6/10 tumors) and reduces latency (5.5 to 10 days) compared to the control. The co-delivery of ARA and EPA results in a reduced tumor burden analogous to the control group, suggesting that EPA directly opposes the mechanism of ARA-mediated tumor formation. DHA acts through a non-oxidative mechanism. Conclusions: Sustained high-dose ω3 (weeks/months) is safe and well-tolerated in humans. These results suggest that ω3 DHA and EPA delivery at ultra-high doses may represent a viable low-toxicity therapy for neuroblastoma."

      "abstract": "Chronic stress is a common trigger of multiple neuropsychiatric illnesses. Animal models are widely used to study stress-induced brain disorders and their interplay with neuroinflammation and other neuroimmune processes. Here, we apply the prolonged 12-week chronic unpredictable stress (PCUS) model to examine rat behavioral and hippocampal transcriptomic responses to stress and to chronic 4-week treatment with a classical antidepressant fluoxetine, an anti-inflammatory agent eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide and their combinations. Overall, PCUS evoked anxiety-like behavioral phenotype in rats, corrected by chronic fluoxetine (alone or combined with other drugs), and EPA. PCUS also evoked pronounced transcriptomic responses in rat hippocampi, involving > 200 differentially expressed genes. While pharmacological manipulations did not affect hippocampal gene expression markedly, Gpr6, Drd2 and Adora2a were downregulated in stressed rats treated with fluoxetine, EPA and fluoxetine + EPA, suggesting their respective protein products (G protein-coupled receptor 6, dopamine D2 receptor and adenosine A2A receptor) as potential evolutionarily conserved targets under chronic stress. Overall, these findings support the validity of rat PCUS paradigm as a useful model to study stress-related anxiety pathogenesis, and call for further research probing how various conventional and novel drugs may (co)modulate behavioral and neurotranscriptomic biomarkers of chronic stress.",

      "abstract": "The biofilm formation of Candida albicans, a major human fungal pathogen, represents a crucial virulence factor during candidiasis. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, has emerged as a potential antibiofilm agent against C. albicans. Herein, we aim to investigate the antifungal effect of EPA (1 mM) on the mature biofilm of C. albicans and explore the underlying mechanism. Crystal violet and XTT assays showed that EPA exerted a strong inhibitory efficacy on preformed biofilms in C. albicans. Biofilm architecture and cell viability were observed using scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, indicating that EPA could block the yeast-to-hypha transition and damage the structure, thereby exhibiting antibiofilm activity. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that EPA treatment led to the downregulation of genes associated with hyphal formation and biofilm development. From the signaling pathway perspective, EPA regulated the C. albicans biofilms involving two signaling pathways, namely, Ras1-cAMP-PKA and Cek-MAPK pathways. Additionally, the EPA could effectively reduce the production of key messenger cAMP in the Ras1-cAMP-PKA pathway. Interestingly, in response to EPA, ergosterol biosynthesis-related genes were down-regulated, indicating EPA as antifungal agent might reduce the risk of developing drug resistance. The findings of this study highlight the potential of EPA as an alternative or adjunctive antibiofilm agent against C. albicans-related infections."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is often associated with impaired proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is predominantly found in fish oil, has been recognized for its intestinal health benefits, although the potential mechanisms are not well understood. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the regulatory role and mechanism of EPA in colonic epithelial regeneration, specifically from the perspective of ISCs. METHODS: Wild-type mice whose diet was supplemented with 5% EPA-enriched fish oil were subjected to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis. We utilized intestinal organoids, ISC-specific lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) knockout mice, and WNT inhibitor-treated mice to explore how EPA influences ISC proliferation and differentiation. ISC proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis were assessed using tdTomato and propidium iodide tracer testing, histological analyses, and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: EPA treatment significantly mitigated the symptoms of DSS-induced acute colitis, as evidenced by lower body weight loss and decreased disease activity index, histological scores and proinflammatory cytokine levels. Additionally, EPA increased the numbers of proliferative cells, absorptive cells, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells, which enhanced the regeneration of intestinal epithelium. Pretreatment with EPA increased ISC proliferation and differentiation, and protected against TNF-α-induced cell death in intestinal organoids. Mechanistically, EPA upregulated G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) to induce LSD1 expression, which facilitated ISC proliferation and differentiation in organoids. ISC-specific ablation of LSD1 negated the protective effect of EPA on DSS-induced colitis in mice. Moreover, EPA administration activated the WNT signaling pathway downstream of LSD1 in ISCs, while inhibiting WNT signaling abolished the beneficial effects of EPA. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that EPA promotes ISC proliferation and differentiation, thereby enhancing colonic epithelial regeneration through the activation of LSD1-WNT signaling. Consequently, dietary supplementation with EPA represents a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for managing IBD."

      "abstract": "Microalgal-bacterial biofilms have emerged as a promising approach for wastewater treatment. However, its potential to treat high-concentration ammonia‑nitrogen wastewater coupling with high-value fatty acid production remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the efficiency of a microalgal-bacterial biofilm in treating high-concentration ammonia‑nitrogen wastewater and its ability to produce high-value fatty acids, with the activated sludge (bacteria) and microalgal-bacterial suspension as control. The results indicated that pollutant removal in the microalgal-bacterial biofilm system was the most efficient, with a 98.3 % removal efficiency for chemical oxygen demand, 87.46 % for ammonium nitrogen, and 20.6 % for phosphate. Coupling analysis of microbial community shift and nitrogen conversion genes showed that the relative abundance of Rhodanobacter and Nitrosomonas significantly increased in microalgal-bacterial biofilms, and the expression of nitrification-related genes (amo and hao) and denitrification-related genes (nasA,napA, narI, narV, nirK, and norB) increased compared to the control systems, which played an important role in nitrogen removal. The microalgal-bacterial biofilm system exhibited higher levels of fatty acid synthase and omega-6 fatty acid desaturation, resulting in a dry weight content and production of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with 15.8,19.1 times greater than that achieved by the microalgal suspension system. These results present a foundation for application of pollutant removal in high ammonia nitrogen wastewater coupling with high-value acid production by microalgal-bacterial biofilms.",

We hypothesize that the accumulation of LPC n-3 in the brain is lower in mice carrying the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor for developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease in humans. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether two or four months of supplementation with LPC n-3 increases the levels of docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) in the frontal cortex of APOE3 and APOE4 mice. METHODS: APOE3 and APOE4 mice were administered LPC n-3 (9.6 mg DHA + 18.3 mg EPA) or sunflower oil (control) by oral gavage for two or four months (n = 5-8 per genotype, per treatment, and per treatment duration). At the end of the treatment period, frontal cortices were collected, and their FA profiles analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. RESULTS: After two months of gavage with LPC n-3, APOE3 mice showed increased levels of EPA in their cortex, but not DHA. In APOE4 mice, neither EPA nor DHA levels were significantly affected. After four months of LPC n-3, both APOE3 and APOE4 mice exhibited higher EPA levels, while changes in DHA levels were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: LPC n-3 supplementation increased EPA, but not DHA, levels in the frontal cortex of mice in a duration- and APOE genotype-dependent manner.

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an essential nutrient that benefits the cardiovascular system, but its effect on DC remains unknown. Here, we report that EPA protects against DC in streptozotocin and high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice, with an emphasis on the reduction of cardiac M1-polarized macrophages. In vitro, EPA abrogates cardiomyocyte injury induced by M1-polarized macrophages, switching macrophage phenotype from M1 to Mox, but not M2, polarization. Moreover, macrophage Mox polarization combats M1-polarized macrophage-induced cardiomyocyte injury. Further, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) was identified to maintain the Mox phenotype, mediating EPA suppression of macrophage M1 polarization and the consequential cardiomyocyte injury. Mechanistic studies reveal that G-protein-coupled receptor 120 mediates the upregulation of HO-1 by EPA. Notably, EPA promotes Mox polarization in monocyte-derived macrophages from diabetic patients. The current study provides EPA and macrophage Mox polarization as novel strategies for DC intervention.",

However, their effects on local muscle endurance remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of EPA/MCT intake on muscle endurance during leg extension exercises and subsequent muscle fatigue. METHODS: This 8-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind parallel-group trial involved 20 healthy young men. Subjects were randomly assigned to an EPA/MCT group (10 subjects) and a placebo group (PL group, 10 subjects). They consumed 4560 mg of the test food daily for 8 wk before an exercise intervention. The EPA/MCT supplement contained 600 mg of EPA, 260 mg of DHA, and 1890 mg of MCT (1110 mg of octanoic acid and 780 mg of decanoic acid). After the 8-week intervention, the subjects performed four sets of leg extension exercises at 40% of their body weight until exhaustion. The number of repetitions per set and the total repetitions across the four sets served as indicators of muscle endurance. Isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), range of motion, circumference, muscle thickness, echo intensity, and muscle stiffness were measured before and after exercise to assess muscle fatigue. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups in the number of repetitions for sets 1-4 or in the total number of repetitions during the leg extension exercise. In the EPA/MCT group, a significant negative correlation was observed between the increase in the blood EPA/AA ratio and the rate of decrease in the number of repetitions. Additionally, the decrease in MVC after exercise was significantly smaller in the EPA/MCT group than in the PL group. CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that an 8-week intake of EPA/MCT can increase the blood EPA/AA ratio and improve muscle endurance performance. Additionally, EPA/MCT intake reduces muscle fatigue after exercise.",

BACKGROUND: Chronic migraine is characterized by a minimum of 15 headache days/month, necessitating a focus on preventive treatment strategies. EPA, a polyunsaturated fatty acid recognized for its anti-inflammatory properties, is examined for its potential effectiveness in chronic migraine management. METHODS: A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of eligible participants with a confirmed diagnosis of chronic migraine were enrolled. The intervention group received 1000 mg of EPA twice daily for 8 weeks, while the control group received two placebo softgels. Symptoms were recorded at 4 and 8 weeks. The primary outcome was assessed using the Headache Impact Test-6 to evaluate changes in patients. Secondary outcomes encompassed migraine headache days, headache severity measured via a visual analog scale, and the number of consumed painkillers. Descriptive analyses were reported in mean (± standard deviation [SD]). RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included in the study and finally, 56 patients completed the study according to the protocol, including 47 (84%) females. The data comparison at baseline did not show any significant difference between the two groups except in the number of patients using valproic acid as prophylaxis (21 patients in the EPA group, and 13 in the placebo group; p = 0.037). The results showed after 8 weeks, a mean (SD) difference of Headache Impact Test-6 in the EPA and placebo groups was -6.96 (3.34) and -4.43 (5.24), respectively (p = 0.084). Regarding migraine headache days, participants reported a mean (SD) -9.76 (4.15) and -4.60 (4.87) decline in days with headache, respectively (p < 0.001). The number of attacks per month after 8 weeks was 3.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-4.0) and 4.0 (95% CI 3.0-6.0), respectively (p < 0.001). Regarding severity, there was no significant difference between the two groups (mean [SD] difference: -0.76 [1.13] and -0.73 [1.04], respectively; p = 0.906). In terms of adverse events, two patients in the EPA group reported intolerable nausea and vomiting, and one patient in the placebo group reported dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings support the potential of a daily 2000 mg EPA as a prophylactic pharmacotherapy in chronic migraine management, specifically in mitigating migraine attacks, migraine headache days, and overall quality of life.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 maintenance hemodialysis patients with severe pruritus symptoms completed this randomized, placebo-controlled study. Subjects of treatment group (n = 30) were instructed to consume 1000 mg fish oil (>900 mg EPA) and subjects of placebo group (n = 30) were instructed to consume 1000 mg soybean oil twice daily for 3 months. 5-D pruritus scoring, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale, skin moisture, serum creatinine, inflammatory factors, and cardiometabolic parameters were examined at baseline, and at the first, second, and third month post-supplementation. RESULTS: A significantly decreased pruritus level was observed in the treatment group, whereas an opposite result was observed in the placebo group. Increased skin moisture levels on both the face and arms were observed in the treatment group, but not in the placebo group. Supplementation of EPA significantly decreased serum CRP and IL-6 levels. Significant decreases in total cholesterol (CHO), and triglycerides (TG) levels were observed; however, a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level was observed in the treatment group. There was no change in plasma creatinine (CR) observed in both groups. A significantly decreased BDI score was observed, whereas the opposite result was observed in the placebo group. A correlational study showed that the severity of pruritus was significantly associated with skin moisture and serum CRP. The severity of pruritus was also positively correlated with the BDI score. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of EPA may provide multiple benefits including alleviating pruritus symptoms, addressing skin dryness, and mitigating depression in maintenance hemodialysis patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction involves reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability due to NO synthase uncoupling linked to increased oxidation and reduced cofactor availability. Loss of endothelial function and NO bioavailability are associated with inflammation, including leukocyte activation. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) administered as icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular events in REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial) in relation to on-treatment EPA blood levels. The mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for EPA remain incompletely elucidated but likely involve direct effects on the endothelium. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, human ECs were treated with EPA and challenged with the cytokine IL-6 (interleukin-6). Proinflammatory responses in the ECs were confirmed by ELISA capture of sICAM-1 (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α). Global protein expression was determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry tandem mass tag. Release kinetics of NO and peroxynitrite were monitored using porphyrinic nanosensors. IL-6 challenge induced proinflammatory responses from the ECs as evidenced by increased release of sICAM-1 and TNF-α, which correlated with a loss of NO bioavailability. ECs pretreated with EPA modulated expression of 327 proteins by >1-fold (P<0.05), compared with IL-6 alone. EPA augmented expression of proteins involved in NO production, including heme oxygenase-1 and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1, and 34 proteins annotated as associated with neutrophil degranulation. EPA reversed the endothelial NO synthase uncoupling induced by IL-6 as evidenced by an increased [NO]/[peroxynitrite] release ratio (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These direct actions of EPA on EC functions during inflammation may contribute to its distinct cardiovascular benefits.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate and analyze the effects of a flushing diet containing Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from Lemuru (Sardinella sp) fish oil on the reproductive performance parameters of Garut ewes. Forty (n = 40) primiparous Garut ewes aged 12-14 months with an average body weight of 28.92 ± 4.94 kg were assigned into four experimental treatment groups. The experimental diets contained roughage: concentrate (30:70%) designated as control concentrate (CNT), flushing concentrate with 6% palm oil (PO), flushing concentrate with 3% palm oil mixed with 3% lemuru oil as DHA and EPA sources (PFO), and flushing concentrate with the addition of 6% lemuru oil (FO). Treatment animals were fed two weeks before and after conception and parturition (8 weeks of total flushing treatment). The addition of fish oil at either 3% (PFO) or 6% (FO) resulted in significantly higher reproductive performance of ewes by increasing the litter size, as reflected by the birth of multiple kids (P < 0.05) compared to CNT and PO. Adding fish oil (PFO and FO) also maintains gestation, resulting in increased lamb yield, especially in the FO treatment, which yields the highest lamb yield (0% single lamb birth). The lamb male ratio was also higher with fish oil supplementation (PFO and PO) (P < 0.05). This research revealed a positive effect of 6% Lemuru oil on decreasing embryo loss and increasing the proportion of twin births. These findings thus support the hypothesis that ration flushing with double the required DHA and EPA from 6% Lemuru fish oil (FO) resulted in significantly higher reproductive performance in Garut sheep.",

Thus, we sought to determine if targeting fetal inflammation improves muscle growth outcomes. Heat stress-induced IUGR fetal lambs were infused with eicosapentaenoic acid (IUGR+EPA; n = 9) or saline (IUGR; n = 8) for 5 days during late gestation and compared to saline-infused controls (n = 11). Circulating eicosapentaenoic acid was 42% less (p < 0.05) for IUGR fetuses but was recovered in IUGR+EPA fetuses. The infusion did not improve placental function or fetal O2 but resolved the 67% greater (p < 0.05) circulating TNFα observed in IUGR fetuses. This improved myoblast function and muscle growth, as the 23% reduction (p < 0.05) in the ex vivo differentiation of IUGR myoblasts was resolved in IUGR+EPA myoblasts. Semitendinosus, longissimus dorsi, and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles were 24-39% lighter (p < 0.05) for IUGR but not for IUGR+EPA fetuses. Elevated (p < 0.05) IL6R and reduced (p < 0.05) β2 adrenoceptor content in IUGR muscle indicated enhanced inflammatory sensitivity and diminished β2 adrenergic sensitivity. Although IL6R remained elevated, β2 adrenoceptor deficits were resolved in IUGR+EPA muscle, demonstrating a unique underlying mechanism for muscle dysregulation. These findings show that fetal inflammation contributes to IUGR muscle growth deficits and thus may be an effective target for intervention."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A fatty acid desaturase (FADS) insertion-deletion (Indel) polymorphism (rs66698963) influences the expression of FADS1, which controls the synthesis of n-6 highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) arachidonic acid (AA). The anti-inflammatory activity of the n-3 HUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) may be explained by competition with AA for proinflammatory lipid mediator synthesis. A precision medicine approach based on stratification by FADS Indel genotype could identify individuals, who benefit from greatest disease risk reduction by n-3 HUFAs. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that the FADS insertion (I) allele predicts colorectal polyp risk reduction in a secondary analysis of the randomized, placebo-controlled, 2×2 factorial seAFOod polyp prevention trial of EPA 2000 mg daily and aspirin 300 mg daily for 12 mo (ISRCTN05926847). METHODS: Participant Indel genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) blind to trial outcomes. Colorectal polyp outcomes were included in negative binomial (polyp number) and logistic (polyp detection rate [PDR; percentage with one or more polyps]) regression models comparing each active intervention with its placebo. Presence of ≥1 Indel I allele and an interaction term (I allele × active intervention) were covariates. RESULTS: In 528 participants with colonoscopy and FADS Indel data, EPA use irrespective of Indel genotype, was not associated with reduced colorectal polyp number (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.92; 95% confidence interval: 0.74, 1.16), mirroring original seAFOod trial analysis. However, the presence of ≥1 I allele identified EPA users with a significant reduction in colorectal polyp number (IRR: 0.50 [0.28, 0.90]), unlike aspirin, for which there was no interaction. Similar findings were obtained for the PDR. CONCLUSIONS: The FADS Indel I allele identified individuals, who displayed colorectal polyp prevention by EPA with a similar effect size to aspirin. Assessment of rs66698963 as a biomarker of therapeutic response to n-3 HUFAs in other populations and healthcare settings is warranted. The seAFOod polyp prevention trial and STOP-ADENOMA study were registered at International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry as ISRCTN05926847.",

This trial aimed to assess the clinical benefits of icosapent ethyl in patients with coronary artery disease, a low EPA/arachidonic acid (AA) ratio, and statin treatment. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point study, patients with stable coronary artery disease and a low EPA/AA ratio (<0.4) were randomized to EPA (1800 of icosapent ethyl administered daily) or control group. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal ischemic stroke, unstable angina pectoris, and coronary revascularization. The secondary composite end points of coronary events included sudden cardiac death, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring emergency hospitalization and coronary revascularization, or coronary revascularization. RESULTS: Overall, 3884 patients were enrolled at 95 sites in Japan. Among them, 2506 patients had a low EPA/AA ratio, and 1249 and 1257 patients were randomized to the EPA and control group, respectively. The median EPA/AA ratio was 0.243 (interquartile range, 0.180-0.314) and 0.235 (interquartile range, 0.163-0.310) in the EPA and control group, respectively. Over a median period of 5 years, the primary end point occurred in 112 of 1225 patients (9.1%) and 155 of 1235 patients (12.6%) in the EPA and control group, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.62-1.00]; P=0.055). Meanwhile, the secondary composite end point of coronary events in the EPA group was significantly lower (81/1225 [6.6%] versus 120/1235 [9.7%] patients; hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.55-0.97]). Adverse events did not differ between the groups, but the rate of new-onset atrial fibrillation was significantly higher in the EPA group (3.1% versus 1.6%; P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Icosapent ethyl treatment resulted in a numerically lower risk of cardiovascular events that did not reach statistical significance in patients with chronic coronary artery disease, a low EPA/AA ratio, and statin treatment.

METHODS: Baseline and on-treatment (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] 2 g daily or placebo for 6 months) levels of n-3 HUFAs, and plasma 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE), were analysed according to APOE genotype (based on polymorphisms rs429358 and rs7412) in 584 participants. RESULTS: Before treatment, APOE2/2 individuals had lower levels, and APOE4/4 participants had higher levels, of n-3 HUFAs, including EPA, than APOE3/3 counterparts (P < 0.01 for the APOE2/2 versus APOE4/4 comparison). After EPA supplementation, n-3 HUFA levels were not significantly different when stratified by APOE genotype, although APOE4 carriers displayed lower plasma 18-HEPE levels than individuals without an APOE4 allele (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: APOE genotype is associated with differential n-3 HUFA and 18-HEPE levels in individuals with multiple colorectal polyps.",

      "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of cancer cachexia. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs): eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are known to contribute to the reduction of inflammation, preservation of lean body mass and total body weight, and reduction of cancer-related symptoms, such as anorexia or neuropathy. This systematic review aimed to assess whether the ratio of EPA to DHA used in supplementation in cancer patients matters in the context of the resolution of inflammation and reduction of the risk of cachexia. The analysis included 20 randomized clinical trials with acceptable quality identified from the Pubmed/MEDLINE database. The significant results concerning the resolution of inflammation or improvement in nutritional status were the highest in the case of a low EPA/DHA ratio, i.e., 67%, and decreased, reaching 50% and 36% for the moderate and high ratios, respectively. Most results concerning body weight from high and moderate EPA/DHA ratios showed no benefit or were insignificant. A significant benefit in reducing any reported inflammatory markers was seen in the low EPA/DHA ratio subgroup at 63%, in the moderate at 29%, and in the high ratio subgroup at 11%. The greatest benefit in CRP reduction was obtained by patients during chemotherapy. The review questions the anticachectic and anti-inflammatory effect of ω-3 PUFAs supplementation with doses of EPA higher than DHA. A population that particularly benefits from ω-3 PUFAs supplementation are patients undergoing chemotherapy for advanced cancer.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DCD) is a severe complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), threatening the life quality of the diabetic population. However, there is still a lack of effective approaches for its intervention. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that was not previously investigated for its effect on DCD. In this study, EPA was found to improve DCD in a mouse model of type 2 DM (T2DM) induced by streptozotocin and a high-fat diet, exhibiting profound protective effects on cognitive dysfunction, neuronal loss, and cerebral oxidative stress and inflammation. While EPA did not attenuate advanced glycation end product-induced neuron injury, we hypothesized that EPA might protect neurons by regulating microglia polarization, the effect of which was confirmed by the co-culture of neurons and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglia. RNA sequencing identified nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) antioxidant signaling as a major target of EPA in microglia. Mechanistically, EPA increased sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1 or P62) levels that might structurally inhibit Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP1), leading to nuclear translocation of NRF2. P62 and NRF2 predominantly mediated EPA's effect since the knockdown of P62 or NRF2 abolished EPA's protective effect on microglial oxidative stress and inflammation and sequential neuron injuries. Moreover, the regulation of P62/KEPA1/NRF2 axes by EPA was confirmed in the hippocampi of diabetic mice. The present work presents EPA as an effective nutritional approach and microglial P62/KEAP1/NRF2 as molecular targets for the intervention of DCD.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we report that eicosapentaenoic acid activates phosphoglycerate mutase 2, which mediates the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate into 3-phosphoglycerate. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in glycerol degradation, thereby facilitating the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, phosphoglycerate mutase 2 inhibits mitochondrial metabolism, promoting the formation of fast-type muscle fibers. Treatment with eicosapentaenoic acid and phosphoglycerate mutase 2 knockdown induced opposite transcriptomic changes, most of which were enriched in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Phosphoglycerate mutase 2 activated the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which inhibited the phosphorylation of FOXO1, and, in turn, inhibited mitochondrial function and promoted the formation of fast-type muscle fibers. Our results suggest that eicosapentaenoic acid promotes skeletal muscle growth and regulates glucose metabolism by targeting phosphoglycerate mutase 2 and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",

SUBJECTS/METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted at the Endocrinology Clinic of Imam Reza Hospital in Tabriz. It aimed to determine the impact of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), and curcumin supplements on various health indicators in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) from 2021.02.01 to 2022.02.01. The study was a randomized double-blinded clinical trial and conducted over 12 weeks with 100 participants randomly divided into four groups. Stratified randomization was used to assign participants to two months of supplementation based on sex and Body Mass Index (BMI). The study comprised four groups: Group 1 received 2 capsules of 500 mg EPA and 200 mg DHA, along with 1 nano-curcumin placebo; Group 2 received 1 capsule of 80 mg nano-curcumin and 2 omega 3 Fatty Acids placebos; Group 3 received 2 capsules of 500 mg EPA and 200 mg DHA, and 1 capsule of 80 mg nano-curcumin; Group 4, the control, received 2 omega 3 Fatty Acids placebos and 1 nano-curcumin placebo. RESULTS: After twelve weeks of taking EPA + Nano-curcumin supplements, the patients experienced a statistically significant reduction in insulin levels in their blood [MD: -1.44 (-2.70, -0.17)]. This decrease was significantly greater than the changes observed in the placebo group [MD: -0.63 (-1.97, 0.69)]. The EPA + Nano-curcumin group also showed a significant decrease in High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) levels compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the EPA + Nano-curcumin group had a significant increase in Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) levels compared to the placebo group (p < 0.01). However, there were no significant differences in Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS), Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index, Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), or Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels between the four groups (all p > 0.05). There were significant differences between the Nano-curcumin and EPA groups [MD: -17.02 (-32.99, -1.05)], and between the Nano-curcumin and control groups [MD: -20.76 (-36.73, -4.79)] in terms of lowering the serum cholesterol level. The difference in Triglycerides (TG) serum levels between the EPA + Nano-curcumin and placebo groups were not statistically significant (p = 0.093). The Nano-curcumin group showed significant decreases in Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) levels compared to the EPA group [MD: -20.12 (-36.90, -3.34)] and the control group [MD: -20.79 (-37.57, -4.01)]. There was a near-to-significant difference in High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) serum levels between the EPA + Nano-curcumin and EPA groups (p = 0.056). Finally, there were significant differences in the decrease of serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels between the EPA and Nano-curcumin groups [MD: -127.50 (-247.91, -7.09)], the EPA and placebo groups [MD: 126.25 (5.83, 246.66)], the EPA + Nano-curcumin and Nano-curcumin groups [MD: -122.76 (-243.17, -2.35)], and the EPA + Nano- curcumin and placebo groups [MD: 121.50 (1.09, 241.92)]. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that 12-week supplementation with EPA and Nano-curcumin may positively impact inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic parameters in patients with diabetes. The supplementation of EPA and Nano-curcumin may be a potential intervention to manage diabetes and reduce the risk of complications associated with diabetes. However, further research is needed to validate the study's findings and establish the long-term effects of EPA and Nano-curcumin supplementation in patients with diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may benefit migraine improvement, though prior studies are inconclusive. This study evaluated the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on episodic migraine (EM) prevention. Seventy individuals with EM participated in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from March 2020 and May 2022. They were randomly assigned to either the EPA (N = 35, 2 g fish oil with 1.8 g of EPA as a stand-alone treatment daily), or the placebo group (N = 35, 2 g soybean oil daily). Migraine frequency and headache severity were assessed using the monthly migraine days, visual analog scale (VAS), Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in comparison to baseline measurements. The EPA group significantly outperformed the placebo in reducing monthly migraine days (-4.4 ± 5.1 days vs. - 0.6 ± 3.5 days, p = 0.001), days using acute headache medication (-1.3 ± 3.0 days vs. 0.1 ± 2.3 days, p = 0.035), improving scores for headache severity (ΔVAS score: -1.3 ± 2.4 vs. 0.0 ± 2.2, p = 0.030), disability (ΔMIDAS score: -13.1 ± 16.2 vs. 2.6 ± 20.2, p = 0.001), anxiety and depression (ΔHADS score: -3.9 ± 9.4 vs. 1.1 ± 9.1, p = 0.025), and quality of life (ΔMSQ score: -11.4 ± 19.0 vs. 3.1 ± 24.6, p = 0.007). Notably, female particularly benefited from EPA, underscoring its potential in migraine management. In conclusion, high-dose EPA has significantly reduced migraine frequency and severity, improved psychological symptoms and quality of life in EM patients, and shown no major adverse events, suggesting its potential as a prophylactic for EM.",

METHODS: We selected 30,976 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2005 and 2018. Depressive symptoms were diagnosed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). EPA intake was assessed through dietary evaluation. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline regression (RCS) were employed to assess the correlation between EPA and depressive symptom. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 7.3 %. Participants with depressive symptoms exhibited lower EPA intake from food compared to non-depressed individuals. This negative association with depressive symptoms persisted even after accounting for various potential influencing factors (e.g., age, gender, body mass index, total energy intake, comorbidities). Notably, EPA demonstrated a nonlinear association with depressive symptoms, particularly in females. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes a significant negative correlation between EPA consumption and depressive symptoms, particularly in females. This suggests that maintaining a rich EPA diet may play a role in depression prevention and treatment.",

We investigated the mechanisms of VEGF-induced MCP-1 expression and the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated that VEGF enhanced MCP-1 gene expression and protein secretion in HUVECs. Western immunoblot analysis revealed that VEGF induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (IκB). Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580) or NF-κB (BAY11-7085) significantly suppressed VEGF-induced MCP-1 in HUVECs. EPA inhibited VEGF-induced MCP-1 mRNA, protein secretion, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and the translocation of phospho-p65 to the nucleus. Additionally, VEGF also stimulated gene expressions of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, which were suppressed by SB203580, BAY11-7085, and EPA. The present study has demonstrated that VEGF-induced activation of MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8 involves the p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways and that EPA inhibits VEGF-induced MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8 via suppressing these signaling pathways. This study supports EPA as a beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic drug to reduce the VEGF-induced activation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines.",

C57BL/6 mice fed with a high-fat diet for 4 weeks and the newly gestated were selected and injected with streptozotocin for GDM modeling. We demonstrated that the fasting insulin levels (FINS) and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) in serum and blood glucose level were significantly higher in GDM group than in normal control (NC) group. The low or high dose of EPA intervention reduced these levels, and the effect of high dose intervention was more significant. The area under the curve in GDM group was higher than that of NC group, and then gradually decreased after low or high dose of EPA treatment. The serum levels of TC, TG and LDL were increased in GDM group, while decreased in EPA group. GDM induced down-regulation of HDL level, and the low or high dose of EPA gradually increased this level. The levels of p-AKT2Ser, p-IRS-1Tyr, GLUT4, and ratios of pIRS-1Tyr/IRS-1 and pAKT2Ser/AKT2 in gastrocnemius muscle were reduced in GDM group, while low or high dose of EPA progressively increased these alterations. GDM enhanced TLR4, NF-kappaB p65, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels in placental tissues, and these expressions were declined at different dose of EPA, and the decrease was greater at high dose. We concluded that EPA receded the release of inflammatory factors in the placental tissues by inhibiting the activation of TLR4 signaling, thereby alleviating the IR.",

      "abstract": "Weight loss is a major issue in Head and Neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing curative radiotherapy. The principal objective of the study was to observe whether eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) containing protein supplement was effective in mitigating the weight loss during in hospitalized HNC undergoing curative radiotherapy. A retrospective study was performed based on clinical, treatment and nutritional data of 53 patients received EPA containing supplement during their curative radiotherapy from October 2014 to January 2015 and was compared with 88 historical control group of patients (October 2013 to June 2014) who had indigenous protein rich diet planned by the dietician in the period immediately before the implementation of providing EPA containing protein supplement to the patients. The data was stratified based on gender, age, weight, treatment modalities, stage and site of cancer and analysed using unpaired t test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. The results indicate there was no significant difference in the patient tumor and clinical details. The results indicate that the percent change in weight loss was less in the EPA cohorts when calculated from weight (P < 0.006) and Body Mass Index (BMI) perspective (P < 0.003). Detail analysis suggested that beneficial effects were more in males (P < 0.01), people affected with oral cancer (P < 0.02), people below the age of 40 (P < 0.001), and in people with early stage cancer (P < 0.003). Cumulatively all these results suggest that administering EPA containing protein supplement was effective in arresting weight loss in HNC patients undergoing curative radiotherapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between prechemotherapy blood eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels, sarcopenia, and overall survival in patients with pancreatic and biliary tract cancer undergoing chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with recurrent, non-resected pancreatic or biliary tract cancer undergoing chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. The skeletal muscle mass was measured at the third lumbar vertebra. Sarcopenia cut-off values were based on the Japanese Society of Hepatology sarcopenia assessment criteria. Two months after starting chemotherapy, the patients received enteral nutrition containing omega-3 fatty acids. RESULTS: Patients with pancreatic and biliary tract cancers with low pre-treatment blood EPA levels had significantly more intense sarcopenia than those with high EPA levels (p=0.023). Patients with sarcopenia before chemotherapy had significantly lower overall survival than those without sarcopenia. Multivariate analysis revealed blood EPA concentration as an independent prognostic factor (p<0.01). Lumbar muscle volume, a marker of sarcopenia, showed a clear positive correlation with prechemotherapy EPA concentration (p=0.008). In patients administered with enteral nutrition containing omega-3 fatty acids, both EPA concentration and lumbar muscle volume were significantly higher than those prior to intervention, indicating sarcopenia improvement due to the intervention. CONCLUSION: In patients with recurrent non-resected pancreatic and biliary tract cancer, low blood EPA levels before chemotherapy are associated with sarcopenia and poor prognosis."

The available ω-3 fatty acid products differ from each other in composition and content. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) formulation on cardiometabolic biomarkers in high cardiovascular (CV) risk patients. The study included 226 subjects with high TG and ≥1 of the following CV risk factors: arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ultrasound-documented atheromatosis, peripheral artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. Participants received 2 g EPA twice daily for 3 months, along with typical nutritional counseling. Cardiometabolic hematological parameters (TG, low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein [HDL], non-HDL, total cholesterol [TChol], apolipoprotein A1 [Apo A1], apolipoprotein B [Apo B], glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were measured at baseline and at 3 months. The mean patients' age was 61.1 ± 1.4 years and the mean baseline TG was 2.97 ± 0.15 mmol/L. Apart from Apo A1, all other biomarkers significantly (p < 0.05) improved at 3 months, regardless of sex (except Apo B) and age: TG 1.75 ± 0.09 versus 2.97 ± 0.15 mmol/L, LDL 2.46 ± 0.08 versus 3.05 ± 0.13 mmol/L, HDL 1.22 ± 0.03 versus 1.11 ± 0.03 mmol/L, non-HDL 3.29 ± 0.10 versus 4.14 ± 0.16 mmol/L, TChol 4.55 ± 0.10 versus 5.15 ± 0.13 mmol/L, Apo A1 26.8 ± 9.3 versus 22.5 ± 8.6 μmol/L, Apo B 1.25 ± 0.23 versus 1.29 ± 0.23 μmol/L, glucose 5.66 ± 0.11 versus 5.99 ± 0.17 mmol/L, HbA1c 5.83 ± 0.1 versus 5.97 ± 0.1% and CRP 1.92 ± 0.2 versus 5.26 ± 2.8 mg/L. In conclusion, adding highly purified EPA product (4 g daily) on nutritional counseling leads to a significant TG reduction.

Serum fatty acid fractions and their associations with ICI treatment efficacy were also investigated. The results showed that long-term survivors (those who survived for ≥ 3 years) consumed significantly more seafood than short-term survivors (those who survived for < 3 years). Furthermore, the serum levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as well as the ratio of EPA to arachidonic acid (EPA/AA) were higher in the long-term survivors than those in the short-term survivors. The group with a high serum EPA/AA ratio had a significantly higher overall survival rate after ICI treatment than the group with a low serum EPA/AA ratio. In conclusion, higher dietary seafood consumption may improve OS in lung cancer patients treated with ICI and the serum EPA/AA ratio may be a useful biomarker for determining the efficacy of ICI treatment. Thus, supplements that increase the serum EPA/AA ratio could serve as new nutritional interventions for enhancing the efficacy of ICI treatment. However, further large-scale case and intervention studies are required.",

The most promising results emerged from the new trials on a high-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-only approach, instead of the previously prescribed therapy with EPA + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The evidence of the reduction of cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk with EPA is intriguing. However, physicians have expressed concern about the potential high risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) occurrence due to such an approach. This study aims to investigate the current evidence on the cardiovascular benefits of EPA and its association with atrial arrhythmogenesis. Current guidelines consider EPA (as IPE) treatment for selected patients but with no specific indication regarding AF risk evaluation.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There remains an unmet need for safe and cost-effective adjunctive treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is safe, well-tolerated and has anti-inflammatory as well as antineoplastic properties. A phase 2 randomised trial of preoperative EPA free fatty acid 2 g daily in patients undergoing surgery for CRC liver metastasis showed no difference in the primary endpoint (histological tumour proliferation index) compared with placebo. However, the trial demonstrated possible benefit for the prespecified exploratory endpoint of postoperative disease-free survival. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that EPA treatment, started before liver resection surgery (and continued postoperatively), improves CRC outcomes in patients with CRC liver metastasis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The EPA for Metastasis Trial 2 trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of 4 g EPA ethyl ester (icosapent ethyl (IPE; Vascepa)) daily in patients undergoing liver resection surgery for CRC liver metastasis with curative intent. Trial treatment continues for a minimum of 2 years and maximum of 4 years, with 6 monthly assessments, including quality of life outcomes, as well as annual clinical record review after the trial intervention. The primary endpoint is CRC progression-free survival. Key secondary endpoints are overall survival, as well as the safety and tolerability of IPE. A minimum 388 participants are estimated to provide 247 CRC progression events during minimum 2-year follow-up, allowing detection of an HR of 0.7 in favour of IPE, with a power of 80% at the 5% (two sided) level of significance, assuming drop-out of 15%. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical and health research authority approval was obtained in January 2018. All data will be collected by 2025. Full trial results will be published in 2026. Secondary analyses of health economic data, biomarker studies and other translational work will be published subsequently. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03428477.",

      "abstract": "Acquired drug resistance poses a significant challenge in osteosarcoma therapy. Therefore, it is necessary for us to discover and develop an alternative anti-cancer strategy. Previous studies have shown that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly increases chemosensitivity in cancer cells. In this study, we discovered that EPA enhances the sensitivity of osteosarcoma to cisplatin (DDP). Interestingly, in addition to inhibiting growth and inducing apoptosis, EPA also enhances DDP-induced ferroptosis. Western blot analysis confirmed that EPA treatment significantly decreases the expression of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), p-AKT, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in cells. Knockdown of DNA-PKcs by siRNA further enhances the level of ferroptosis induced by EPA. Importantly, EPA can reverse the high expression level of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) induced by DDP. ELISA and western blotting analysis revealed that EPA treatment decreases the levels of IL-6 and p-STAT3, which are increased by DDP treatment. Furthermore, a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay confirmed the interaction between DNA-PKcs and PD-L1, and knockdown of DNA-PKcs further reduces the expression of PD-L1. This data provides the first evidence that EPA suppresses the DNA-PKcs/AKT/NRF2/GPX4 pathway to enhance ferroptosis, and inhibits IL-6/STAT3 and DNA-PKcs to decrease PD-L1 expression, thereby sensitizing osteosarcoma to DDP. The combination of EPA and DDP presents an encouraging and promising anti-tumor strategy.",

We investigated (1) the effect of aspirin 300 mg daily and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 2000 mg daily, alone and in combination, on urinary biomarker levels and, (2) whether urinary biomarker levels predicted colorectal polyp risk, during participation in the seAFOod polyp prevention trial. Urinary PGE-M and 11-d-TXB2 were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The relationship between urinary biomarker levels and colorectal polyp outcomes was investigated using negative binomial (polyp number) and logistic (% with one or more polyps) regression models. Despite wide temporal variability in PGE-M and 11-d-TXB2 levels within individuals, both aspirin and, to a lesser extent, EPA decreased levels of both biomarkers (74% [P ≤ .001] and 8% [P ≤ .05] reduction in median 11-d-TXB2 values, respectively). In the placebo group, a high (quartile [Q] 2-4) baseline 11-d-TXB2 level predicted increased polyp number (incidence rate ratio [IRR] [95% CI] 2.26 [1.11,4.58]) and risk (odds ratio [95% CI] 3.56 [1.09,11.63]). A low (Q1) on-treatment 11-d-TXB2 level predicted reduced colorectal polyp number compared to placebo (IRR 0.34 [0.12,0.93] for combination aspirin and EPA treatment) compared to high on-treatment 11-d-TXB2 values (0.61 [0.34,1.11]). Aspirin and EPA both inhibit PGE-M and 11-d-TXB2 synthesis in keeping with shared in vivo cyclooxygenase inhibition. Colorectal polyp risk and treatment response prediction by 11-d-TXB2 is consistent with a role for platelet activation during early colorectal carcinogenesis. The use of urinary 11-d-TXB2 measurement for a precision approach to colorectal cancer risk prediction and chemoprevention requires prospective evaluation.",

Many degenerative diseases, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, are related to cellular senescence as a pathophysiological mechanism. We aimed to examine whether EPA could protect vascular endothelial cells under stress conditions against stress-induced accelerated senescence (SIAS). Methods: Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to H2O2 as oxidative stress and a high glucose concentration with palmitate as a glucolipotoxic condition. Changes in cell viability, apoptosis, lactate dehydrogenase release, and cell cycle analysis were measured by cell counting kit-8 assay, annexin V/ propidium iodide staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. EPA was applied in stress conditions. The degree of senescence was measured by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and p16 staining using immunofluorescence. Apoptosis and cellular senescence-related proteins were measured by Western blotting. Results: Cultured HUVECs under oxidative and glucolipotoxic stresses revealed accelerated senescence and increased apoptosis. These changes were markedly reversed by EPA administration, and the expressions of apoptosis and cellular senescence-related proteins were reversed by EPA treatment. Conclusion: EPA effectively protects HUVECs against SIAS, which may be one of its pleotrophic effects.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as a new option for controlling the residual risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) in the statin era. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is associated with reduced CAD risk in the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention trial, whereas the Statin Residual Risk with Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia trial that used the combination EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has failed to derive any clinical benefit. These contradictory results raise important questions about whether investigating the antiatherosclerotic effect of omega-3 fatty acids could help to understand their significance for CAD-risk reduction. METHODS: The Attempts at Plaque Vulnerability Quantification with Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using Noncontrast T1-weighted Technic EPA/DHA study is a single-center, triple-arm, randomized, controlled, open-label trial used to investigate the effect of EPA/DHA on high-risk coronary plaques after 12 months of treatment, detected using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with CAD receiving statin therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to no-treatment, 2-g/day, and 4-g/day EPA/DHA groups. The primary endpoint was the change in the plaque-to-myocardium signal intensity ratio (PMR) of coronary high-intensity plaques detected by CMR. Coronary plaque assessment using computed tomography angiography (CTA) was also investigated. RESULTS: Overall, 84 patients (mean age: 68.2 years, male: 85%) who achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of ＜100 mg/dL were enrolled. The PMR was reduced in each group over 12 months. There were no significant differences in PMR changes among the three groups in the primary analysis or analysis including total lesions. The changes in CTA parameters, including indexes for detecting high-risk features, also did not differ. CONCLUSION: The EPA/DHA therapy of 2 or 4 g/day did not significantly improve the high-risk features of coronary atherosclerotic plaques evaluated using CMR under statin therapy.",

This study aimed to examine the efficacy of interesterified structured lipids EPA and MCTs on cardiorespiratory endurance. METHODS: This 8-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study involved 19 healthy men. The participants were randomly assigned to a group that received interesterified structured lipids EPA and MCTs (STG group, 9 participants) or a group receiving a PM of EPA and MCTs (PM group, 10 participants). The outcome measures were time to exhaustion (TTE) and time to reach the anaerobic threshold in the peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) test, VO2peak, and anaerobic threshold. RESULTS: The increase in TTE in the VO2peak test after the intervention period compared with before the intervention period was significantly greater in the STG group (53 ± 53 s) than in the PM group (-10 ± 63 s; p < 0.05). Similarly, the increase in time to reach the anaerobic threshold was significantly greater in the STG group (82 ± 55 s) than in the PM group (-26 ± 52 s; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the consumption of interesterified structured lipids EPA and MCTs improved endurance in humans.",

Although ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) displayed significant anti-hyperglycemic activity, the insulinotropic effects of their metabolites remain unknown. In this study, we took advantage of a transgenic model, mfat-1, that overexpresses an ω-3 desaturase and can convert ω-6 PUFAs to ω-3 PUFAs. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was sharply elevated in the pancreatic tissues of mfat-1 transgenic mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast to the WT mice, the mfat-1 transgenics did not develop overt diabetes and still maintained normal blood glucose levels and insulin secretion following streptozotocin-treatment. Furthermore, under the condition of pancreatic β-cell damage, co-incubation of the metabolites of EPA produced from the CYP 450 pathway with isolated islets promoted the overexpression of insulin as well as β-cell specific markers, pdx1 and Nkx6.1 in pancreatic α-cells. Addition of EPA metabolites to the cultured glucagon-positive α-cell lines, a series of pancreatic β-cell markers were also found significantly elevated. Combined together, these results demonstrated the effects of ω-3 PUFAs and their metabolites on the trans-differentiation from α-cells to β-cells and its potential usage in the intervention of T1DM."

However, there are no approved and effective treatments for lowering Lp(a) and the associated cardiovascular risks. Omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3FAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have both triglyceride-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties. This pilot study investigated the effect of high dose ω-3FAs (3.6 g/day) on arterial inflammation in 12 patients with elevated Lp(a) (> 0.5 g/L) and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) receiving cholesterol-lowering treatment. Arterial inflammation was determined using 18F-fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography before and after 12-weeks intervention. ω-3FAs significantly lowered plasma concentrations of triglycerides (-17%, p < 0.01), Lp(a) (-5%, p < 0.01) as well as aortic maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) (-4%, p < 0.05). The reduction in SUVmax was significantly inversely associated with average on-treatment EPA (r = -0.750, p < 0.01), but not DHA and triglyceride, concentrations. In conclusion, high dose ω-3FAs decrease arterial inflammation in patients with elevated Lp(a) and stable CAD, which may involve a direct arterial effect of EPA.",

This study investigated the effect of energy supplementation and the combination of anti-inflammatory factor (eicosapentaenoic acid; EPA) and muscle-synthesis promotor (branched-chain amino acids; BCAA) on body composition, muscle, and inflammatory biomarkers in elderly with inadequate protein intake. METHODS: A randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 84 elderly with inadequate protein intake. The participants were randomly assigned into four groups receiving a complete nutrition drink; (1) control formula, (2) fortified with 2.2 g EPA, (3) with 2.2 g EPA and 5 g BCAA (2:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val), and (4) with 2.2 g EPA plus 5g BCAA (4:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val). Each subject consumed two sachets of the drink to gain 500 kcal/day and performed arm muscle exercises for 3 weeks. Body compositions and handgrip strength were measured using BIA and a dynamometer, respectively. Plasma EPA and BCAA levels were determined using LC-MS/MS to ensure compliance. Muscle protein biomarkers including histidine, β-alanine, and carnosine were measured using LC-MS/MS. Serum inflammatory (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) were measured by using ELISA. RESULTS: No symptoms and signs of adverse events were observed. The right arm muscle mass and handgrip strength were significantly increased after consuming a complete nutrition drink fortified with EPA + BCAA 2:1:1 and 4:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively. Consistently, consuming such combinatory formula non-significantly elevated carnosine with reduced histidine, and increased IL-10 with decreased IL-6. All relevant intervention groups showed a significant increase in plasma levels of BCAA and EPA. CONCLUSION: Consuming a complete nutrition drink fortified with 2.2g EPA and 5g BCAA 2:1:1 or 4:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val for 3 weeks may increase right arm muscle mass and strength in elderly with inadequate protein intake. The tendency of increased dipeptide (carnosine)/decreased free amino acid (histidine) suggests a shift toward muscle protein synthesis. The trend of decreased inflammatory/increased anti-inflammatory cytokines suggests an anti-inflammatory effect. Future long-term studies are warranted to confirm the combinatory effect of BCAA and EPA in the prevention of sarcopenia.

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Dietary supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) can alter the lipidome profiles of adipocytes, thereby counteract obesity. DHA/EPA in the form of phospholipids demonstrates higher bioavailability than triglyceride or ethyl ester (EE), but their effects on the lipidome and metabolic changes during obesity are still unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: High-fat diet-induced obese mice are treated with different molecular forms of EPA, and EPA supplemented as phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsEtn) has a superior effect on reducing fat mass accumulation than phosphatidylcholine (PC) or EE. The lipidomics analysis indicates that EPA in form of PlsEtn but not PC or EE significantly decreases total PC and sphingomyelin content in white adipose tissue (WAT). Some specific polyunsaturated fatty acid -containing PCs and ether phospholipids are increased in EPA-PlsEtn-fed mice, which may attribute to the upregulation of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid elongation reactions in WAT. In addition, the expression of genes related to fatty acid catabolism is also promoted by EPA-PlsEtn supplementation, which may cause the decreased content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid-containing PCs. CONCLUSIONS: EPA-PlsEtn supplementation is demonstrated to remodel lipidome and regulate the fatty acid metabolic process in WAT, indicating it may serve as a new strategy for obesity treatment in the future.",

      "abstract": "Delayed wound healing is a devastating complication of diabetes and supplementation with fish oil, a source of anti-inflammatory omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acids including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), seems an appealing treatment strategy. However, some studies have shown that ω-3 fatty acids may have a deleterious effect on skin repair and the effects of oral administration of EPA on wound healing in diabetes are unclear. We used streptozotocin-induced diabetes as a mouse model to investigate the effects of oral administration of an EPA-rich oil on wound closure and quality of new tissue formed. Gas chromatography analysis of serum and skin showed that EPA-rich oil increased the incorporation of ω-3 and decreased ω-6 fatty acids, resulting in reduction of the ω-6/ω-3 ratio. On the tenth day after wounding, EPA increased production of IL-10 by neutrophils in the wound, reduced collagen deposition, and ultimately delayed wound closure and impaired quality of the healed tissue. This effect was PPAR-γ-dependent. EPA and IL-10 reduced collagen production by fibroblasts in vitro. In vivo, topical PPAR-γ-blockade reversed the deleterious effects of EPA on wound closure and on collagen organization in diabetic mice. We also observed a reduction in IL-10 production by neutrophils in diabetic mice treated topically with the PPAR-γ blocker. These results show that oral supplementation with EPA-rich oil impairs skin wound healing in diabetes, acting on inflammatory and non-inflammatory cells.",

The purpose of the current study is to assess the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplementation on serum HSP-27, glycemic status and anthropometric indices in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with T2DM were randomly allocated to obtain 2 g per day EPA (n = 18) or placebo (n = 18) for 8 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Fasting serum levels of HSP 27, fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1C, as well as anthropometric indices were measured. RESULTS: EPA supplementation reduces the serum level of HSP 27 in the EPA group compared with the placebo (P < 0.03). Although waist circumference (WC) decreased significantly in the EPA group at the end of the trial (P < 0.02), there was no significant difference in weight, WC, body mass index (BMI), and glycemic markers in both groups after intervention (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found that EPA supplementation reduces HSP 27 serum level in T2DM patients. However, future large-scale trials are needed."

The previous study demonstrates that eicosapentaenoic acid-enriched phospholipids (EPA-PL) prevent body weight loss in a mouse model of CAC. However, the role of EPA-PL on cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) mouse model is established, then the effect and underlying mechanism of EPA-PL on skeletal muscle atrophy in LLC-bearing mice are investigated. The results reveal that EPA-PL treatment significantly attenuates skeletal muscle atrophy in LLC-bearing mice, as evidenced by suppressing the reductions of skeletal muscle mass, myofiber cross-sectional area, and grip strength. Besides, the study finds that EPA-PL alleviated cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy via balancing muscle protein degradation and synthesis, inhibiting type I oxidative muscle fibers atrophy, and promoting mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the results also indicate that EPA-PL may counteract skeletal muscle atrophy in LLC mouse model via a sirtuin 1-dependent mechanism. CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that EPA-PL may be beneficial as a nutritional supplement for prevention and treatment of cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were allocated to two groups depending on individual preference: Patients in the treatment group received 2 g of EPA daily for two weeks prior to surgery (NANT group, n=18). Patients in the control group had a normal diet (CONT group, n=26). NF-B translocation rate, in specimens collected, was investigated by histopathology. Five hundred malignant cells were counted, and tissues with 10% or higher NF-B nuclear translocation were determined to be positive. RESULTS: The EPA blood concentration rose significantly in the NANT group (p<0.01). The positive rate of NF-B nuclear translocation in cancer cells was 11.1% in the NANT group compared with 50% in the CONT group. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Increased blood concentrations of EPA after preoperative supplementation was associated with suppression of NF-B nuclear translocation in malignant cells. These results suggest that intake of EPA-containing supplements before surgery can control NF-B activation and by extension, cancer aggressiveness.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Inhalation of air pollution small particle matter (PM) is a leading cause of cardiovascular (CV) disease. Exposure to PMs causes endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction as evidenced by nitric oxide (NO) synthase uncoupling, vasoconstriction and inflammation. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been shown to mitigate PM-induced adverse cardiac changes in patients receiving omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. We set out to determine the pro-inflammatory effects of multiple PMs (urban and fine) on pulmonary EC NO bioavailability and protein expression, and whether EPA restores EC function under these conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We pretreated pulmonary ECs with EPA and then exposed them to urban or fine air pollution PMs. LC/MS-based proteomic analysis to assess relative expression levels. Expression of adhesion molecules was measured by immunochemistry. The ratio of NO to peroxynitrite (ONOO-) release, an indication of eNOS coupling, was measured using porphyrinic nanosensors following calcium stimulation. Urban/fine PMs also modulated 9/12 and 13/36 proteins, respectively, linked to platelet and neutrophil degranulation pathways and caused > 50% (p < 0.001) decrease in the stimulated NO/ONOO- release ratio. EPA treatment altered expression of proteins involved in these inflammatory pathways, including a decrease in peroxiredoxin-5 and an increase in superoxide dismutase-1. EPA also increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), a cytoprotective protein, by 2.1-fold (p = 0.024). EPA reduced elevations in sICAM-1 levels by 22% (p < 0.01) and improved the NO/ONOO- release ratio by > 35% (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These cellular changes may contribute to anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective and lipid changes associated with EPA treatment during air pollution exposure.",

This study measured levels of plasma and rectal mucosal oxylipins in participants of the seAFOod 2 × 2 factorial, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, who received aspirin 300 mg daily and EPA 2000 mg free fatty acid, alone and in combination, for 12 months. METHODS: Resolvin (Rv) E1, 15-epi-lipoxin (LX) A4 and respective precursors 18-HEPE and 15-HETE (with chiral separation) were measured by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in plasma taken at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, as well as rectal mucosa obtained at trial exit colonoscopy at 12 months, in 401 trial participants. RESULTS: Despite detection of S- and R- enantiomers of 18-HEPE and 15-HETE in ng/ml concentrations, RvE1 or 15‑epi-LXA4 were not detected above a limit of detection of 20 pg/ml in plasma or rectal mucosa, even in individuals randomised to both aspirin and EPA. We have confirmed in a large clinical trial cohort that prolonged (12 months) treatment with EPA is associated with increased plasma 18-HEPE concentrations (median [inter-quartile range] total 18-HEPE 0.51 [0.21-1.95] ng/ml at baseline versus 0.95 [0.46-4.06] ng/ml at 6 months [P<0.0001] in those randomised to EPA alone), which correlate strongly with respective rectal mucosal 18-HEPE levels (r = 0.82; P<0.001), but which do not predict polyp prevention efficacy by EPA or aspirin. CONCLUSION: Analysis of seAFOod trial plasma and rectal mucosal samples has not provided evidence of synthesis of the EPA-derived specialised pro-resolving mediator RvE1 or aspirin-trigged lipoxin 15‑epi-LXA4. We cannot rule out degradation of individual oxylipins during sample collection and storage but readily measurable precursor oxylipins argues against widespread degradation.",

Lipid subclass composition information was obtained through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS), and bioavailability tests were performed using the Caco-2 cell monolayer model. Results showed that enzymatic treatment improved the incorporation of EPA/DHA as diacylglycerol (DG) while silica gel column chromatography enriched the content of EPA/DHA as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (12.58%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (4.99%). Furthermore, increasing the purity of EPA/DHA could improve its bioavailability and after 24 incubation, binding forms of triglyceride (TG) was superior to ethyl ester (EE) (p < 0.05) at the same purity level. Those findings are helpful to provide research basis for exploring the bioactivity of fish oil."

      "abstract": "Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been reported to play an anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress role in a series of human diseases, including major depressive disorder. However, its exact mechanism is still largely unknown. Mouse BV-2 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an in vitro inflammatory cell model of depression. Cytotoxic effects were assessed with MTT and lactate dehydrigebase release assays. Cytokine mediators were elevated by western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Autophagy-relators were determined by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses. Interaction relationships among molecules were evaluated utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual luciferase assays. Methylated miR-29a-3p was detected via methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. EPA treatment at 60 μM had no cytotoxic effects on BV2 cells and significantly inhibited the LPS-induced inflammatory response and NLRP3 inflammasome but activated autophagy, while all these effects were reversed by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. Importantly, miR-29a-3p exhibited a role similar to that of EPA in LPS-treated BV2 cells. Mechanistically, EPA treatment elevated miR-29a-3p by repressing its promoter methylation. MAPK8 was a direct target of miR-29a-3p. Inhibition of miR-29a-3p greatly diminished the regulatory roles mediated by EPA in LPS-treated BV2 cells, while these roles were further impeded after MAPK8 silencing. To conclude, our data demonstrated that EPA treatment alleviated LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammasomes by activating autophagy via regulation of miR-29a-3p/MAPK8 signaling, which further elucidates the potential antidepressant mechanism of EPA.",

Based on our previous study, we speculated that EPA might be associated with the development of healed plaques and might limit thrombus size. This study aimed to elucidate the association between EPA and arachidonic acid (AA) ratios and various plaque characteristics in patients with plaque rupture. METHODS: A total of 95 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) caused by plaque rupture who did not take lipid-lowering drugs and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention using optical coherence tomography (OCT) were included. Clinical characteristics, lipid profiles, and OCT findings were compared between patients with lower and higher EPA/AA ratios (0.41) according to the levels in the Japanese general population. RESULTS: In the high EPA/AA (n=29, 30.5%) and low EPA/AA (n=66, 69.5 %) groups, the high EPA/AA group was significantly older (76.1 vs. 66.1 years, P＜0.01) and had lower peak creatine kinase (556 vs. 1651 U/L, P=0.03) than those with low EPA/AA. Similarly, patients with high EPA/AA had higher prevalence of layered and calcified plaque (75.9 vs. 39.4 %, P＜0.01; 79.3 vs. 50.0 %, P＜0.01, respectively) than low EPA/AA group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a high EPA/AA ratio was an independent factor in determining the development of layered and calcified plaques. CONCLUSION: A high EPA/AA ratio may be associated with the development of layered and calcified plaques in patients with plaque rupture.",

      "abstract": "Our previous studies have found that caprylic acid (C8:0) can improve blood lipids and reduce inflammation levels and may be related to the upregulation of the p-JAK2/p-STAT3 pathway by ABCA1. This study aims to investigate the effects of C8:0 and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on lipids, inflammatory levels, and the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in ABCA1-deficient mice (ABCA1-/-) and ABCA1 knock-down (ABCA1-KD) RAW 264.7 cells. Twenty 6-week ABCA1-/- mice were randomly divided into four groups and fed a high-fat diet, or a diet of 2% C8:0, 2% palmitic acid (C16:0) or 2% EPA for 8 weeks, respectively. The RAW 264.7 cells were divided into the control or control + LPS group, and the ABCA1-KD RAW 264.7 cells were divided into ABCA1-KD with LPS (LPS group), ABCA1-KD with LPS + C8:0 (C8:0 group), and ABCA1-KD with LPS + EPA (EPA group). Serum lipid profiles and inflammatory levels were measured, and ABCA1 and JAK2/STAT3 mRNA and protein expressions were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. Our results showed that serum lipid and inflammatory levels increased in ABCA1-/- mice (p < 0.05). After the intervention of different fatty acids in ABCA1-/- mice, TG and TNF-α were significantly lower, while MCP-1 increased significantly in the C8:0 group (p < 0.05); however, LDL-C, TC, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels decreased significantly and IL-10 increased significantly in the EPA group (p < 0.05). In the aorta of ABCA1-/- mice, C8:0 significantly decreased p-STAT3 and p-JAK2 mRNA, while EPA significantly reduced TLR4 and NF-κBp65 mRNA. In the ABCA1-KD RAW 264.7 cells, TNF-α and MCP-1 were increased significantly and IL-10 and IL-1β were significantly decreased in the C8:0 group (p < 0.05). The protein expressions of ABCA1 and p-JAK2 were significantly higher, and the NF-κBp65 was significantly lower in the C8:0 and EPA groups (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, compared to the C8:0 group, the NF-κBp65 protein expression was significantly lower in the EPA group (p < 0.05). Our study showed that EPA had better effects than C8:0 on inhibiting inflammation and improving blood lipids in the absence of ABCA1. C8:0 may be involved mainly in inhibiting inflammation through upregulation of the ABCA1 and p-JAK2/p-STAT3 pathways, while EPA may be involved mainly in inhibiting inflammation through the TLR4/NF-κBp65 signaling pathway. The upregulation of the ABCA1 expression pathway by functional nutrients may provide research targets for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.",

Among them, the long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFAs, as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are of special importance. Scarce data are available about the fatty acid (FA) composition of the ruminant brain in response to dietary intervention. However, we decided to examine the brain and retina FA composition of lambs supplemented with an EPA-rich microalga feed for 21 days, as it is known that despite the extensive biohydrogenation of dietary PUFAs in the rumen, ruminants can selectively accumulate some n-3 LC-PUFAs in their brain and retinal tissues. Twenty-eight male lambs were fed a control diet, or the same diet further supplemented with Nannochloropsis sp. microalga. Their brains and retina were collected for FA characterization. Overall, the brain FA profile remained unchanged, with little alteration in omega-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) enhancement in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Retinal tissues were particularly responsive to the dietary intervention, with a 4.5-fold enhancement of EPA in the freeze-dried-fed lambs compared with the control lambs. We conclude that retinal tissues are sensitive to short-term n-3 PUFA supplementation in lambs."

Nevertheless, there are certain limitations to the application of EPA due to its structural characteristics. To maximize the nutritive value of EPA, a type of medium- and long-chain triacylglycerol (MLCT) enriched with EPA was designed and synthesized using the lipase-catalyzed transesterification of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) and EPA-enriched fish oil (FO). RESULTS: The optimum synthesis conditions for EPA-enriched MLCT used Lipozyme RM as catalyst, and had a substrate mass ratio (MCT/EPA-enriched FO) of 3:1, lipase loading of 80 g kg-1 , a reaction temperature of 60 °C, and a reaction time of 6 h. The MLCT content was as high as 80.79% after the transesterification reaction and the purification, and the content of MLCT containing EPA accounted for 70.21%. The distribution of EPA at the sn-2 position showed a significant increase in MLCT compared with the original substrate, from 18.89% to 26.93%. The in vitro digestion results demonstrated that MLCT had a significantly higher EPA bioaccessibility than the original substrate. CONCLUSION: Eicosapentaenoic acid-enriched MLCT was developed.

The EPA treatment improved left ventricular systolic function and increased the mitochondrial content of EPA in the non-infarct region 12 weeks after MI. The content of ATP and mitochondrial complex II, III, and IV activities decreased after MI but were maintained by the EPA treatment in association with the preservation of optic atrophy 1, a mitochondrial fusion protein.

However, the effects of EPA-PLs on glucose and lipid metabolism in the case of CD36 mutation are unclear. Thus, spontaneously hypertensive rats/NCrl (SHR) were used as a CD36 mutation model to determine the effects of dietary 2% EPA-PLs for 4 weeks on glucose and lipid metabolism. The results showed that the intervention of EPA-PLs significantly alleviated the abnormal increase of serum free fatty acid levels and glycerol levels in SHRs. Moreover, the administration of EPA-PLs decreased the triglyceride levels and cholesterol levels by 31.1% and 37.9%, respectively, in the liver. Dietary EPA-PLs had no effect on epididymal fat weight, but EPA-PLs inhibited adipocyte hypertrophy in SHRs. Further mechanistic research found that EPA-PL pretreatment significantly reduced triacylglycerol catabolism and increased fatty acid β-oxidation. Additionally, the administration of EPA-PLs decreased the area under the curve of the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and fasting serum insulin levels by activating the IRS/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, EPA-PL pretreatment significantly increased the CD36 gene expression in the liver tissues, adipose tissues and muscle tissues even in the case of CD36 mutation. These results indicated that EPA-PLs alleviate glucose and lipid metabolism in the case of CD36 mutation, which provides a precise nutrition strategy for people with CD36 mutation.",

This study determined hepatic fatty acid composition and expression of genes and mediators involved in lipid metabolism following chemotherapy treatment. Female rats bearing the Ward colon tumor were administered Irinotecan (CPT-11) +5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and maintained on a control diet or a diet containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (2.3 g/100 g fish oil). Healthy animals provided with a control diet served as a reference group. Livers were collected one week after chemotherapy. Triacylglycerol (TG), phospholipid (PL), ten lipid metabolism genes, leptin, and IL-4 were measured. Chemotherapy increased TG content and reduced EPA content in the liver. Expression of SCD1 was upregulated by chemotherapy, while dietary fish oil downregulated its expression. Dietary fish oil down-regulated expression of the fatty acid synthesis gene FASN, while restoring the long chain fatty acid converting genes FADS2 and ELOVL2, and genes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation (CPT1α) and lipid transport (MTTP1), to values similar to reference animals. Neither leptin nor IL-4 were affected by chemotherapy or diet. Depletion of EPA is associated with pathways evoking enhanced TG accumulation in the liver. Restoring EPA through diet may pose a dietary strategy to attenuate chemotherapy-associated impediments in liver fatty acid metabolism.",

OBJECTIVE: To study the possible protective effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in EH - induced by estradiol valerate (EV) in rats. METHODS/MATERIALS: Adult female Wistar rats were given EV with or without EPA for 10 days. The uterine changes were evaluated by both physical (weight index) and histopathological methods. The markers of oxidative stress (Uterine malondialdehyde (MDA) and serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as well as serum estradiol and progesterone levels, and apoptosis (uterine caspase-3) were determined. Immunohistochemical estimations of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in addition to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) immunoblotting were measured in uterine tissue. KEY FINDINGS: EV showed significant increase in uterine weight index that is accompanied with histopatholigical evidences of EH. Such changes were associated with significant alterations in oxidative stress markers, modulation of estradiol and progesterone serum levels, an increase in HIF-1α, NF-κB and VEGF immuno-expressions and a significant decrease in caspase-3. EPA, in either dose, showed significant amelioration in uterine weight index as well as in histopathological changes. Such effect was accompanied with significant improvement in the measured hormonal levels, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: EPA in the used doses provided biochemical and histopathological improvement in EV-induced EH via modulation of NF-κB/HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most antidepressant treatment studies have included patients strictly based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders definition of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Given the heterogeneity of MDD, this approach may have obscured inter-patient differences and hampered the development of novel and targeted treatment strategies. An alternative strategy is ​​to use biomarkers to delineate endophenotypes of depression and test if these can be targeted via mechanism-based interventions. Several lines of evidence suggest that \"inflammatory depression\" is a clinically meaningful subtype of depression. Preliminary data indicate that omega-3 fatty acids, with their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, may be efficacious in this subtype of depression, and this study aims to test this hypothesis. METHOD: We conduct a match-mismatch-trial to test if add-on omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) reduces depressive symptoms in patients with MDD and systemic low-grade inflammation. MDD patients on a stable antidepressant treatment are stratified at baseline on high sensitivity-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels to a high-inflammation group (hs-CRP ≥ 3 mg/L) or a low-inflammation group (hs-CRP < 3 mg/L). Both groups receive add-on EPA (2 g per day) for 8 weeks with three study visits, all including blood draws. Patients and raters are blind to inflammation status. Primary outcome measure is change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score between baseline and week 8. We hypothesize that the inflammation group has a superior antidepressant response to EPA compared to the non-inflammation group. Secondary outcomes include a composite score of \"inflammatory depressive symptoms\", quality of life, anxiety, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive performance and change in biomarkers relating to inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolomics and cellular aging. DISCUSSION: In this study we will, for the first time using a match-mismatch trial design, test if omega-3 is an efficacious treatment for inflammatory depression. If our study is successful, it could add to the field of precision psychiatry. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered May 8, 2017 on clinicaltrials.gov under the reference number NCT03143075.",

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the impact of the EPA/AA ratio on the characteristics of non-culprit coronary plaques in statin-treated patients with CAD. METHODS: A total of 370 consecutive stable coronary disease patients treated with statins, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for the culprit lesion and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the non-culprit plaque in a culprit vessel were included. The characteristics of non-culprit plaques assessed using OCT were compared between the lower EPA/AA group (EPA/AA <0.4, n = 255) and the higher EPA/AA group (EPA/AA ≥0.4, n = 115). RESULTS: The prevalence of lipid-rich plaque (58.8 vs. 41.7%, p = 0.003) and plaque with macrophages (56.5 vs. 31.3%, p <0.001) was significantly higher in the lower EPA/AA group than in the higher EPA/AA group. This association was observed even if the LDL-C level was <100 mg/dL. The prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma was significantly higher in patients with lower EPA/AA and higher LDL-C (≥100 mg/dL) than in those with higher EPA/AA and lower LDL-C (<100 mg/dL) (odds ratio: 2.750, 95% confidence interval: 1.182-6.988, p = 0.024). An EPA/AA <0.4 was independently associated with a higher prevalence of lipid-rich plaque, plaque with macrophages, and cholesterol crystals. CONCLUSION: Lower EPA/AA ratio was associated with higher prevalence of vulnerable characteristics in non-culprit plaques. The present results suggest the importance of EPA/AA ratio on the secondary prevention of CAD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been a hot topic since the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS), the first landmark study using a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), indicated that EPA could decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events. Over 20 years have passed since the JELIS was conducted, and the standard treatment for dyslipidemia has altered significantly since then. The JELIS subjects did not undertake the current risk management especially current standard statins and did not exclusively target secondary prevention patients. In addition, the subjects included are relatively high EPA population. Furthermore, the clinical implication of the plasma EPA/arachidonic acid (AA) ratio as a biomarker has not yet been validated. Therefore, the Randomized trial for Evaluation in Secondary Prevention Efficacy of Combination Therapy - Statin and EPA (RESPECT-EPA) was planned and is currently underway in Japan. METHODS: The RESPECT-EPA comprises two parts: the open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) and biomarker study (prospective cohort study design). The RCT included patients with a low EPA/AA ratio. These patients were then randomized to highly purified EPA (1800 mg/day) or control groups. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal ischemic stroke, unstable angina pectoris, and clinically indicated coronary revascularization. The biomarker study assesses the EPA/AA ratio's usefulness as a biomarker for cardiovascular events prediction. RESULTS: In the RCT, a total of 2,460 patients were enrolled in 95 sites in Japan. Patients' baseline characteristics were similar between intervention and control groups in the RCT. The baseline median EPA/AA ratio was 0.243 and 0.235, respectively. A total of 1,314 patients were participated in the observational part, and the baseline median EPA/AA ratio was 0.577. CONCLUSIONS: After this study is completed, we will have further evidence on whether a highly purified EPA is effective in reducing cardiovascular events for secondary prevention or not, as well as whether if EPA/AA ratio is a predictor for future cardiovascular events. This study was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000012069).",

      "abstract": "Hypertension affects 1 in 3 adults in the United States and leads to left ventricular (LV) concentric hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and increased stiffness. The treatment of cardiac fibrosis remains challenging and empiric. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that is highly effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients and cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy in animals when administered before pressure overload by promoting the increase of anti-inflammatory M1 macrophages. In this study, we investigated whether EPA mitigates the exacerbation of cardiac remodeling and fibrosis induced by established hypertension, a situation that closely recapitulates a clinical scenario. Twelve-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were randomized to eat an EPA-enriched or control diet for 20 weeks. We report that rats eating the EPA-enriched diet exhibited a reduction of interstitial cardiac fibrosis and ameliorated LV diastolic dysfunction despite the continuous increase in blood pressure. However, we found that EPA did not have an impact on cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, the EPA diet increased mRNA expression of M2 macrophage marker Mrc1 and interleukin-10 in cardiac tissue. These findings indicated that the antifibrotic effects of EPA are mediated in part by phenotypic polarization of macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages and increases of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10. In summary, EPA prevents the exacerbation of cardiac fibrosis and LV diastolic dysfunction during sustained pressure overload. EPA could represent a novel treatment strategy for hypertensive cardiomyopathy.",

We have developed MND-2119, a novel self-emulsifying formulation of highly purified EPA-E which can be administered once-daily. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of long-term administration of MND-2119 in hypertriglyceridemia patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, 52-week, open-label study, patients with high triglyceride (TG) (TG levels between ≥ 150 and < 500 mg/dL) undergoing lifestyle modification were randomized to MND-2119 2 g/day (n=61) or MND-2119 4 g/day (n=61). RESULTS: The incidence of adverse events in MND-2119 2 g/day and MND-2119 4 g/day was 70.5% and 62.3%, respectively, and the incidence of adverse drug reactions was 9.8% and 8.2%, respectively. There were no notable problems in the safety assessments of both treatment groups. By Week 4, TG levels had decreased from baseline in both groups, and the TG reducing effect continued up to Week 52 (mean percentage change from baseline in TG at Week 52 [two-sided 95% confidence interval]: MND-2119 2 g/day: -16.71% [-26.61, -6.81], MND-2119 4 g/day: -21.01% [-27.86, -14.16]). In both groups, plasma EPA concentration at Week 4 was maintained up until Week 52 and the plasma EPA concentration at Week 52 was 200.5 ± 54.7 μg/mL in MND-2119 2 g/day and 308.6 ± 98.6 μg/mL in MND-2119 4 g/day. CONCLUSION: Long-term administration of MND-2119 was not associated with any safety-related problems. TG levels decreased by Week 4, and the TG reducing effect continued up to Week 52.",

Over a decade, we investigated changes in the serum eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to arachidonic acid (AA) ratio, and in serum concentrations of the individual fatty acids, in a Japanese community. METHODS: Community surveys took place in 2002-2003 and 2012-2013 in a rural area of Japan. The community surveys included 3,194 and 3,220 community dwellers aged ≥ 40 years who did not take EPA medication in 2002-2003 and 2012-2013, respectively. Fatty acid fractionations in serum were measured using a gas chromatography method. Changes in the serum EPA/AA ratio over time were examined using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Overall, the average serum EPA/AA ratio decreased over the 10 years. A decreasing trend in the serum EPA/AA ratio occurred in all age groups except participants aged ≥ 80 years, with larger decreases in the younger age groups. A similar decline in serum EPA/AA ratio occurred in participants with and those without lipid-lowering therapy. Serum EPA concentrations were slightly increased in the whole population but remained stable or even decreased in participants aged 40-69. In contrast, the average serum AA concentrations increased in all age groups. CONCLUSION: In a Japanese community, the serum EPA/AA ratio decreased over 10 years at the population level, especially in middle-aged participants.",

      "abstract": "Benefits of omega 3 fatty acids for cardiovascular and other diseases have been touted for more than 50 years. The one clear clinical benefit of these lipids is the reduction of circulating levels of triglycerides, making them a useful approach for the prevention of pancreatitis in severely hypertriglyceridemic patients. After a series of spectacularly failed clinical trials that were criticized for the choice of subjects and doses of omega 3 fatty acids used, Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) using a high dose of icosapent ethyl (IPE) reported a reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. However, this trial has generated controversy due to the use of mineral oil in the control group and the associated side effects of the IPA. This review will focus on the following topics: What are the epidemiologic data suggesting a benefit of omega 3 fatty acids? What might be the mechanisms for these benefits? Why have the clinical trials failed to resolve whether these fatty acids provide benefit? What choices should a clinician consider?",

This study evaluated the body composition of infants born to women participating in a randomized control exercise intervention study. Participants were randomized to aerobic exercise (n = 25) or control (stretching and breathing) groups (n = 10). From 16 weeks of gestation until delivery, the groups met 3×/week. At 16 and 36 weeks of gestation, maternal blood was collected and analyzed for Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA). At 1 month postnatal, infant body composition was assessed via skinfolds (SFs) and circumferences. Data from 35 pregnant women and infants were analyzed via t-tests, correlations, and regression. In a per protocol analysis, infants born to aerobic exercisers exhibited lower SF thicknesses of triceps (p = 0.008), subscapular (p = 0.04), SF sum (p = 0.01), and body fat (BF) percentage (%) (p = 0.006) compared with controls. After controlling for 36-week DHA and EPA levels, exercise dose was determined to be a negative predictor for infant skinfolds of triceps (p = 0.001, r2 = 0.27), subscapular (p = 0.008, r2 = 0.19), SF sum (p = 0.001, r2 = 0.28), mid-upper arm circumference (p = 0.049, r2 = 0.11), and BF% (p = 0.001, r2 = 0.32). There were no significant findings for PUFAs and infant measures: during pregnancy, exercise dose, but not blood DHA or EPA levels, reduces infant adiposity.",

We have developed MND-2119, a novel self-emulsifying formulation of highly purified EPA-E, which can be administered once-daily. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess non-inferiority in the efficacy of MND-2119 in patients with hypertriglyceridemia compared with highly purified EPA-E. METHODS: In this multicenter, 12-week, double-blind study, patients with high triglyceride (TG levels between ≥ 150 and < 500 mg/dL) undergoing lifestyle modification were randomized to MND-2119 2 g/day (n=145), MND-2119 4 g/day (n=145), EPA-E 1.8 g/day (n=145) or EPA-E 2.7 g/day (n=145). The primary endpoint was percentage change in TG levels from baseline to end of treatment. RESULTS: MND-2119 2, 4 g/day and EPA-E 1.8, 2.7 g/day reduced TG levels from baseline by -10.09%, -15.51%, -9.30%, and -8.80%, respectively. The TG reduction rate of MND-2119 2 g/day was non-inferior to that of EPA-E 1.8 g/day (LS mean difference: -0.42, 95%CI: -5.76 to 4.91). Moreover, the TG reduction rate of MND-2119 4 g/day was superior to that of MND-2119 2 g/day (LS mean difference: -5.74, 95%CI: -10.59 to -0.89). There were no remarkable safety differences between MND-2119 2 g/day and EPA-E 1.8 g/day and between MND-2119 4 g/day and EPA-E 2.7 g/day. CONCLUSION: Non-inferiority of MND-2119 2 g/day to EPA-E 1.8 g/day for efficacy, and superiority of MND-2119 4 g/day over MND-2119 2 g/day for efficacy were verified. MND-2119 was safe and well tolerated.",

Although EPA is used as a nutrient-based pharmaceutical agent or dietary supplement, its molecular target(s) is debatable. Here, we showed that EPA and its metabolites strongly and reversibly inhibit vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), a key molecule for vesicular storage and release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in purinergic chemical transmission. In vitro analysis showed that EPA inhibits human VNUT-mediated ATP uptake at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 67 nM, acting as an allosteric modulator through competition with Cl-. EPA impaired vesicular ATP release from neurons without affecting the vesicular release of other neurotransmitters. In vivo, VNUT-/- mice showed a delay in the onset of neuropathic pain and resistance to both neuropathic and inflammatory pain. EPA potently attenuated neuropathic and inflammatory pain in wild-type mice but not in VNUT-/- mice without affecting the basal nociception. The analgesic effect of EPA was canceled by the intrathecal injection of purinoceptor agonists and was stronger than that of existing drugs used for neuropathic pain treatment, with few side effects. Neuropathic pain impaired insulin sensitivity in previous studies, which was improved by EPA in the wild-type mice but not in the VNUT-/- mice. Our results showed that VNUT is a molecular target of EPA that attenuates neuropathic and inflammatory pain and insulin resistance. EPA may represent a unique nutrient-based treatment and prevention strategy for neurological, immunological, and metabolic diseases by targeting purinergic chemical transmission.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaques associated with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), i.e. culprit lesions, frequently feature a ruptured fibrous cap with thrombotic complications. On imaging, these plaques exhibit a low attenuation, lipid-rich, necrotic core containing cholesterol crystals and are inherently unstable. Indeed, cholesterol crystals are causally associated with plaque vulnerability in vivo; their formation results from spontaneous self-assembly of cholesterol molecules. Cholesterol homeostasis is a central determinant of the physicochemical conditions leading to crystal formation, which are favored by elevated membrane free cholesterol content in plaque endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, and foam cells, and equally by lipid oxidation. Emerging evidence from imaging trials in patients with coronary heart disease has highlighted the impact of intervention involving the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), on vulnerable, low attenuation atherosclerotic plaques. Thus, EPA decreased features associated with unstable plaque by increasing fibrous cap thickness in statin-treated patients, by reducing lipid volume and equally attenuating intraplaque inflammation. Importantly, atherosclerotic plaques rapidly incorporate EPA; indeed, a high content of EPA in plaque tissue is associated with decreased plaque inflammation and increased stability. These findings are entirely consistent with the major reduction seen in cardiovascular events in the REDUCE-IT trial, in which high dose EPA was administered as its esterified precursor, icosapent ethyl (IPE); moreover, clinical benefit was proportional to circulating EPA levels. Eicosapentaenoic acid is efficiently incorporated into phospholipids, where it modulates cholesterol-enriched domains in cell membranes through physicochemical lipid interactions and changes in rates of lipid oxidation. Indeed, biophysical analyses indicate that EPA exists in an extended conformation in membranes, thereby enhancing normal cholesterol distribution while reducing propagation of free radicals. Such effects mitigate cholesterol aggregation and crystal formation. In addition to its favorable effect on cholesterol domain structure, EPA/IPE exerts pleiotropic actions, including antithrombotic, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, and proresolving effects, whose plaque-stabilizing potential cannot be excluded. Docosahexaenoic acid is distinguished from EPA by a higher degree of unsaturation and longer carbon chain length; DHA is thus predisposed to changes in its conformation with ensuing increase in membrane lipid fluidity and promotion of cholesterol aggregation into discrete domains. Such distinct molecular effects between EPA and DHA are pronounced under conditions of high cellular cholesterol content and oxidative stress. This review will focus on the formation and role of cholesterol monohydrate crystals in destabilizing atherosclerotic plaques, and on the potential of EPA as a therapeutic agent to attenuate the formation of deleterious cholesterol membrane domains and of cholesterol crystals. Such a therapeutic approach may translate to enhanced plaque stability and ultimately to reduction in cardiovascular risk.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astaxanthin is a ketocarotenoid with high antioxidant power used in different fields as healthcare, food/feed supplementation and as pigmenting agent in aquaculture. Primary producers of astaxanthin are some species of microalgae, unicellular photosynthetic organisms, as Haematococcus lacustris. Astaxanthin production by cultivation of Haematococcus lacustris is costly due to low biomass productivity, high risk of contamination and the requirement of downstream extraction processes, causing an extremely high price on the market. Some microalgae species are also primary producers of omega-3 fatty acids, essential nutrients for humans, being related to cardiovascular wellness, and required for visual and cognitive development. One of the main well-known producers of omega-3 fatty eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is the marine microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana (named also Microchloropsis gaditana): this species has been already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human consumption and it is characterized by a fast grow phenotype. RESULTS: Here we obtained by chemical mutagenesis a Nannochloropsis gaditana mutant strain, called S4, characterized by increased carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio. S4 strain showed improved photosynthetic activity, increased lipid productivity and increased ketocarotenoids accumulation, producing not only canthaxanthin but also astaxanthin, usually found only in traces in the WT strain. Ketocarotenoids produced in S4 strain were extractible in different organic solvents, with the highest efficiency observed upon microwaves pre-treatment followed by methanol extraction. By cultivation of S4 strain at different irradiances it was possible to produce up to 1.3 and 5.2 mgL-1 day-1 of ketocarotenoids and EPA respectively, in a single cultivation phase, even in absence of stressing conditions. Genome sequencing of S4 strain allowed to identify 199 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP): among the mutated genes, mutations in a carotenoid oxygenase gene and in a glutamate synthase gene could explain the different carotenoids content and the lower chlorophylls content, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: By chemical mutagenesis and selection of strain with increased carotenoids to chlorophyll ratio it was possible to isolate a new Nannochloropsis gaditana strain, called S4 strain, characterized by increased lipids and ketocarotenoids accumulation. S4 strain can thus be considered as novel platform for ketocarotenoids and EPA production for different industrial applications.",

TRPM2 cation channel is gated by the cytosolic ADP-ribose (ADPR) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The high content of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in the brain is a main target of ROS. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) induces oxidant action via the enhance of PUFA content in the glioblastoma (DBTRG) cells. We hypothesized that a combination of CiSP and EPA may offer a potential therapy in the DBTRG cell by exerting the antitumor, oxidant, and apoptotic actions and stimulating Ca2+ influx and TRPM2 activity. In the DBTRG cells, we induced four groups as control, EPA (30 μM for 24 h), CiSP (25 μM for 24 h), and CiSP + EPA. The CiSP-induced intracellular Ca2+ responses to the TRPM2 activation were increased in the DBTRG cells from coming H2O2 and ADPR. The responses were decreased in the cells by the inhibitions of TRPM2 (ACA and 2/APB) and PARP/1 (DPQ and PJ34). The incubation of EPA further increased the intracellular Ca2+ responses, mitochondria function, and the generation of ROS in the DBTRGs. After the treatment of EPA, lipid peroxidation, apoptosis, cell death, caspase -3, -8, and -9 levels were further increased in the DBTRG, although the levels of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, cell numbers, and cell viability were further decreased in the cells. In summary, anticancer, apoptotic, and oxidant actions of CiSP were further increased via the activation of TRPM2 channel in the DBTRGs by the treatment of EPA. Hence, TRPM2 stimulation via EPA could be used as an effective agent in the treatment of glioblastoma tumors with CiSP.",

      "abstract": "Metformin is being actively repurposed for the treatment of gynecologic malignancies including ovarian cancer. We investigated if metformin induces analogous metabolic changes across ovarian cancer cells. Functional metabolic analysis showed metformin caused an immediate and sustained decrease in oxygen consumption while increasing glycolysis across A2780, C200, and SKOV3ip cell lines. Untargeted metabolomics showed metformin to have differential effects on glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolites, while consistent increased fatty acid oxidation intermediates were observed across the three cell lines. Metabolite set enrichment analysis showed alpha-linolenic/linoleic acid metabolism as being most upregulated. Downstream mediators of the alpha-linolenic/linoleic acid metabolism, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were abundant in all three cell lines. EPA was more effective in inhibiting SKOV3 and CaOV3 xenografts, which correlated with inhibition of inflammatory markers and indicated a role for EPA-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators such as Resolvin E1. Thus, modulation of the metabolism of omega-3 fatty acids and their anti-inflammatory signaling molecules appears to be one of the common mechanisms of metformin's antitumor activity. The distinct metabolic signature of the tumors may indicate metformin response and aid the preclinical and clinical interpretation of metformin therapy in ovarian and other cancers."

      "abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and its atherothrombotic complications impose a substantial disease burden in Europe, representing a cost of €210 billion per year for the European Union. Hypertriglyceridemia, a major risk factor for premature ASCVD, is present in more than 20% of the European population, and is a key feature of atherogenic dyslipidemia. Recent findings from the Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis (PESA) cohort in Spain showed that even in apparently healthy, middle-aged individuals without a history of cardiovascular (CV) risk, elevated triglyceride levels are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial inflammation. Emerging evidence from epidemiologic and genetic studies supports an independent causative role of triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and their remnants in this pathology. Icosapent ethyl (IPE) is a highly purified, stable ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that was initially approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia, and subsequently received an expanded indication to reduce the risk of CV events in adult statin-treated patients. Approval was based on the pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT), which showed that high-dose IPE (4 g/day) significantly reduced the risk of primary and secondary composite endpoints comprising major CV events and CV death relative to placebo. In 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved IPE to reduce the risk of CV events in adult statin-treated patients at high CV risk with elevated triglyceride levels (≥1.7 mmol/L [≥150 mg/dL]) and established CV disease, or diabetes and at least one other CV risk factor. Clinical studies in Europe, which included patients with acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and those undergoing cardiac rehabilitation, established that 12.5% to 23.3% of these high-risk populations may benefit from treatment with IPE. Such clinical benefit may in part result from the moderate triglyceride-lowering properties of IPE/EPA; equally however, concentrations of atherogenic remnant particle-cholesterol are markedly reduced. Furthermore, IPE/EPA exerts pleiotropic actions beyond its lipid-lowering properties, which include modulation of endothelial function, attenuation of intra-plaque inflammation and oxidative stress, and reduction in macrophage accumulation. Plasma phospholipids, into which EPA is primarily incorporated and transported, appear to serve as precursors for a series of anti-inflammatory metabolites involving the resolvins RvE1 to RvE3, a pathway which may confer cardioprotective benefits. In addition, plaque imaging data from the Effect of Icosapent Ethyl on Progression of Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients With Elevated Triglycerides on Statin Therapy (EVAPORATE) and the Combination Therapy of Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Pitavastatin for Coronary Plaque Regression Evaluated by Integrated Backscatter Intravascular Ultrasonography (CHERRY) trials show that plaque stabilization may be favorably affected. These factors may act synergistically to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and reduce CV risk. In addition to robust efficacy data, multiple cost-utility studies across several countries indicate that IPE/EPA is a cost-effective treatment option that is favorably situated relative to some common willingness-to-pay thresholds. This review will evaluate the relevance of hypertriglyceridemia to residual ASCVD burden in statin-treated dyslipidemic patients, the potential of IPE/EPA to reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular mortality in high-risk patient populations, and the mechanisms which may underlie these effects. Finally, the clinical implications of the EMA label for IPE will be critically appraised in light of the updated 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines on the management of dyslipidemia and the recent European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, together with considerations of its cost-effectiveness across several countries.",

      "abstract": "Previously it was shown that cisplatin causes muscle atrophy. Under this condition, cisplatin increased the expression of atorogenes, such as muscle ring finger 1 and atrogin-1 (also known as muscle atrophy F-box protein), in mouse skeletal muscle. It was reported recently that ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitinated protein levels in skeletal muscle were also up-regulated in cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy, and cisplatin-induced ubiquitinated proteins were degraded by the 26S proteasome pathway. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is effective against skeletal muscle atrophy in mice. However, it is unclear how EPA suppresses the Ub-proteasome pathway. In this study, the effect of EPA on cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy in mice was examined. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with cisplatin or vehicle control once daily for 4 d. EPA or its vehicle was orally administered 30 min before cisplatin administration. Cisplatin systemic administration induced decrease in muscle mass, myofiber diameter, and increase in Ub genes and ubiquitinated proteins in mouse skeletal muscle were recovered by co-treatment with EPA. However, weight loss and up-regulated atrogenes induced by cisplatin were not changed by co-treatment with EPA in skeletal muscle. In this study, EPA attenuated cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy via down-regulation of up-regulated Ub gene expression. Although further clinical studies are needed, EPA administration can be effective in the development of muscle atrophy in cisplatin-treated patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular benefit from n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is controversial, and the importance of serum eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentrations for clinical events is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess changes in EPA and DHA serum concentrations during n-3 PUFA supplementation and their association with incident cardiovascular events. METHODS: In the OMEMI trial, elderly patients with a recent AMI were randomized to 1.8 g/day of EPA/DHA or control (corn oil) for 2 years. The primary outcome was a composite of AMI, coronary revascularization, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, or all-cause death (major adverse cardiovascular event [MACE]) and the secondary outcome was new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). RESULTS: EPA and DHA measurements were available in 881 (92% of survivors) participants at randomization and study completion. EPA and DHA increased in the active treatment arm (n = 438) by a median of 87% and 16%, respectively. Greater on-treatment increases in EPA and DHA were associated with decreasing triglycerides, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lower baseline EPA and DHA concentrations. Greater on-treatment increases in EPA were associated with lower risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio 0.86 [95% confidence interval, CI, 0.75-0.99], p = 0.034), and higher risk of AF (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.36 [95% CI 1.07-1.72], p = 0.011). Although there were similar tendencies for DHA changes and outcomes, these associations were not statistically significant (HR 0.84 [0.66-1.06] for MACE and 1.39 [0.90-2.13] for AF). CONCLUSION: Greater on-treatment increases in EPA were associated with lower risk of MACE and higher risk of new-onset AF. These data suggest that the cardiovascular effects of increasing n-3 PUFA levels through supplements are complex, involving both potential benefits and harm.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes-induced endothelial pathologies are hypothesized to lead to the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) possibly induces fibrosis, leading to glomerulosclerosis in the kidney. Furthermore, this could lead to albuminuria in diabetic nephropathy due to glomerular endothelial dysfunction. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), purified from fish oil, decreases inflammatory cytokine levels in glomerulonephritis. Here, we aimed at finding whether ethyl eicosapentaenoate (EPA-E) exerts renal protective effects via EndMT inhibition. To find out whether EPA inhibits EndMT in vitro, the changes in CD31 expression were studied in cultured mouse endothelial cells. The addition of the conditioned medium from the adipocyte culture significantly decreased the protein levels of CD31, while the addition of EPA-E partially reversed this inhibition. Further, EndMT inhibition by EPA-E treatment might occur via the inhibition of the protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ)/transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) signaling and not via microRNAs. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice fed a high-fat diet (60% from fat) exhibited mesangial expansion and albuminuria. Induction of EPA-E ameliorated the mesangial expansion and decreased albuminuria without affecting blood pressure, triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, and intraperitoneal glucose. These findings suggest that EPA-E exerts renal protective effects on endothelial cells, by normalizing EndMT followed by the PKCβ/TGF-β/PAI-1 signaling. Thus, EPA-E has the potential for imparting renal protection by regulating EndMT in DKD.",

Multiple studies have reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation exert an enormous function on the occurrence and development of IDD. Autophagy can effectively repair ER stress and maintain ECM homeostasis. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) can specifically induce autophagy. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that EPA can promote autophagy, reduce ECM degradation and ER stress in vitro, thereby reducing cell apoptosis, and the protective effects of EPA in an IDD-rat model in vivo. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect the autophagic flux, ER stress, ECM degradation, and apoptosis in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) treated by EPA. We also used puncture-induced IDD rats as experimental subjects to observe the therapeutic effect of EPA on IDD. Our findings indicated that EPA can effectively improve the autophagy activity in NPCs, inhibit the endoplasmic reticulum stress process, reduce the degree of cell apoptosis, and exert protective effects on the anabolism and catabolism of ECM. In addition, in vivo investigations demonstrated that EPA ameliorated the progression of puncture-induced IDD in rats. In conclusion, this study revealed the intrinsic mechanisms of EPA's protective role in NPCs and its potential therapeutic significance for the treatment of IDD."

In addition, n-3 fatty acids (FAs) and their oxygenated derivatives (oxylipins) have the capacity to modulate immune components. The aim of the current study was to include a fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in sow diets to promote an increase of anti-inflammatory molecules in colostrum and milk to benefit piglets. Thirty-six sows were randomly assigned from insemination to the end of lactation to either a control diet with animal fat (15 g/kg in gestation and 30 g/kg in lactation) or an n-3 diet in which animal fat was totally (gestation) or half (lactation) replaced by an equivalent amount of solid fish oil. Performance of sows and piglets was monitored during the study. Colostrum and milk samples were obtained after the birth of the first piglet and at weaning, respectively. From all samples (n = 18 per treatment), FAs were quantified by gas chromatography and immunoglobulins and cytokines by ELISA. Three samples per treatment were randomly selected to analyse oxylipin composition by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In colostrum and in milk, the n-3 FA (P = 0.020 and P < 0.001), particularly EPA (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) and DHA (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001), and also their oxygenated derivatives were increased in samples from sows fed n-3 diet. Fish oil had no effect on immunoglobulin concentrations, but reduced tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) (P = 0.011) and a tendency to reduce interleukin 10 (IL10) (P = 0.059) were observed in milk. In conclusion, fish oil in sow diets increased n-3 FA, particularly EPA and DHA, and their oxygenated derivatives in colostrum and milk, reducing TNFα and IL10 in milk.",

As an essential unsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) provides various physiological functions; however, its exact regulatory role remains elusive. The current study aimed to address how EPA regulates cellular antioxidant capacity and the possible mechanisms of action. Upon 48 h of EPA treatment, the ROS levels of HepG2 cells were reduced by at least 40%; the total cellular antioxidant capacity was increased by approximately 50-70%, accompanied by enhanced activities and expression of major antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential and the mitochondrial biogenesis were dramatically improved in EPA-treated cells. These data suggest that EPA improves cellular antioxidant capacity by enhancing mitochondrial function and biogenesis, which sheds light on EPA as a dietary complement to relieve the oxidative damage caused by chronic diseases.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Selenoprotein P (SeP, encoded by SELENOP in humans) is a hepatokine that causes insulin resistance in the liver and skeletal muscle. It was found that polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) downregulates Selenop expression by inactivating SREBP-1c. The present study aimed to examine the effect of EPA for 12 weeks on circulating SeP levels and insulin sensitivity in humans with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 20 participants with dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to an EPA (900 mg, twice daily) group and a control group. The primary endpoint was a change in serum SeP levels. Organ-specific insulin sensitivity in the liver (HGP and %HGP), skeletal muscle (Rd), and adipose tissue (FFA and %FFA) were assessed using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study with stable isotope-labeled glucose infusion. RESULTS: Serum SeP levels were not changed in either group at the end of the study. In the EPA group, the changes in SeP levels were positively correlated with the change in serum EPA levels (r = 0.709, P = 0.022). Treatment with EPA significantly enhanced %FFA but not %HGP and Rd. The change in serum EPA levels was significantly positively correlated with the change in %HGP, and negatively correlated with changes in Rd. CONCLUSIONS: The change in serum EPA levels was positively correlated with serum SeP levels, hepatic insulin sensitivity, and negatively with skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in humans with type 2 diabetes. The EPA-induced enhancement of hepatic insulin sensitivity might be associated with a mechanism independent of serum SeP levels.",

During pregnancy, sow obesity can result in an increase in placental lipid deposition, subsequently inhibiting placental angiogenesis and fetal development. However, the effect of different types of fatty acids on placental angiogenesis is still unclear. Trophoblast cells and vascular endothelial cells constitute two important types of placental tissue. In this study, we used palmitic acid (C16:0) and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5, n-3), respectively, to treat porcine trophectoderm cells (pTr2) and porcine iliac artery endothelial cells (PIEC) to study the effects of saturated fatty acids and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on placental angiogenesis in vitro. We found that C16:0 caused significant cytotoxicity in pTr2 and PIEC (p < 0.01) and inhibited the proliferation and migration of PIEC (p < 0.01), whereas C20:5 treatment exhibited very low cytotoxicity and minimal inhibition of cellular proliferation. Meanwhile, a low concentration of C16:0 had no effect on the tube formation in PIEC, whereas C20:5 significantly promoted tube formation of PIEC (p < 0.01). These results suggested that saturated fatty acids and n-3 PUFAs had different effects on placental angiogenesis. As essential functional fatty acid, n-3 PUFA might be effective measure in alleviating the placental lipotoxicity caused by sow obesity during pregnancy.",

METHODS: The effects of EPA on the activity, morphology and cell cycle of HGFs were observed by living and dead cell staining, immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry, respectively. HGFs were stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) or heat inactivated P. gingivalis, after which the effects of EPA on mRNA and protein expression of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β were observed by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. The gene and protein expression of heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) was also detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The data were analyzed with SPSS 22.0 software package. RESULTS: 200 μmol/L EPA inhibited cell activity of HGFs; 100 μmol/L EPA did not affect cell activity and morphology of HGFs, and had no significant effect on cell cycle (P>0.05). EPA significantly downregulated gene expression of IL-6 and IL-1β, and protein expression of IL-6 stimulated by P. gingivalis LPS and heat-killed P.gingivalis(P<0.05), in a dose-dependent manner. EPA increased gene expression of HO-1 in a dose dependent manner(P<0.05), and upregulated HO-1 protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: EPA significantly inhibits the expression of inflammatory factors without affecting the biological activity of HGFs, which may be related to the induction of HO-1, suggesting the potential role of EPA in the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders affect nearly 20% of young adults aged 18-29 years. First-line treatment for anxiety disorders comprises pharmacotherapy and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, options often criticised for their low efficacy and safety. In contrast, fish-oil-based supplements comprising omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and supporting nutrients are gaining recognition as safe and effective alternatives. Here we present the protocol for a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effects of a high eicosapentaenoic acid multinutrient supplement on validated measures of anxiety and depression in healthy university students experiencing non-clinical levels of anxiety and depression. The primary outcome is improvement in anxiety compared to the placebo group assessed via the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 scale. The participants will be randomised to active treatment comprising a daily dose of 1125 mg eicosapentaenoic acid, 441 mg docosahexaenoic acid, 330 mg magnesium and 7.5 mg vitamin E, or placebo, for 24 weeks, and will complete validated questionnaires and tablet-based tasks sensitive to mood at baseline and end of intervention. Circulating fatty acids and key biomarkers will also be assessed. The students will be genotyped for polymorphisms thought to influence the relationship between long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and affect.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit acquired weakness is a serious problem, contributing to respiratory failure and reductions in ambulation. Currently, there is no pharmacological therapy for this condition. Studies indicate, however, that both beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) increase muscle function in patients with cancer and in older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine whether HMB and/or EPA administration would increase diaphragm and quadriceps strength in mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: Studies were performed on 83 mechanically ventilated patients who were recruited from the Medical Intensive Care Units at the University of Kentucky. Diaphragm strength was assessed as the trans-diaphragmatic pressure generated by supramaximal magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation (PdiTw). Quadriceps strength was assessed as leg force generated by supramaximal magnetic femoral nerve stimulation (QuadTw). Diaphragm and quadriceps thickness were assessed by ultrasound. Baseline measurements of muscle strength and size were performed, and patients were then randomized to one of four treatment groups (placebo, HMB 3 gm/day, EPA 2 gm/day and HMB plus EPA). Strength and size measurements were repeated 11 days after study entry. ANCOVA statistical testing was used to compare variables across the four experimental groups. RESULTS: Treatments failed to increase the strength and thickness of either the diaphragm or quadriceps when compared to placebo. In addition, treatments also failed to decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation after study entry. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a 10-day course of HMB and/or EPA does not improve skeletal muscle strength in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients. These findings also confirm previous reports that diaphragm and leg strength in these patients are profoundly low. Additional studies will be needed to examine the effects of other anabolic agents and innovative forms of physical therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01270516.

      "abstract": "The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid has an important role in human health. The Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) examined the prescription omega-3 fatty acid icosapent ethyl (IPE) in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or with diabetes plus additional CVD risk factors. The trial found a large reduction in CVD events, including significant reductions in CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable angina. These results led to the regulatory approval of IPE in a population similar to REDUCE-IT participants in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Moreover, multiple international guidelines have endorsed the use of IPE in such individuals. A secondary analysis of REDUCE-IT examined the endpoint of coronary artery revascularization. This analysis showed a significant reduction not only in coronary revascularization overall but also in elective, urgent, and emergent coronary revascularization. Additionally, IPE significantly reduced the need for both percutaneous coronary intervention and for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Coronary imaging studies have demonstrated significant decreases in rates of plaque progression with IPE, with significant effects within 6-9 months. In parallel, experimental findings corroborate several effects of IPE that provide mechanisms that could contribute to the profound reductions in multiple types of ischemic events, including percutaneous and surgical coronary revascularization. Future trials should explore potential benefits of initiation of IPE at the time of revascularization in broader populations, potentially in conjunction with loading doses.",

Dietary PUFAs incorporate into membrane phospholipids, which may modify the function of membrane proteins. We investigated the consequences of the membrane incorporation of several PUFAs on the key antiatherogenic ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux pathway. Human THP-1 macrophages were incubated with EPA, arachidonic acid (AA) (C20:4 n-6) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6 n-3) for a long time to mimic a chronic exposure. EPA 70 μM, but not AA 50 μM or DHA 15 μM, increased ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein (apo) AI by 28% without altering aqueous diffusion. No variation in ABCA1 expression or localization was observed after EPA treatment. EPA incorporation did not affect the phenotype of THP-1 macrophages. The membrane phospholipids composition of EPA cells displayed higher levels of both EPA and its elongation product docosapentaenoic acid, which was associated with drastic lower levels of AA. Treatment by EPA increased the ATPase activity of the transporter, likely through a PKA-dependent mechanism. Eicosanoids were not involved in the stimulated ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from EPA-enriched macrophages. In addition, EPA supplementation increased the apo AI binding capacity from macrophages by 38%. Moreover, the increased apo AI binding in EPA-enriched macrophages can be competed. In conclusion, EPA membrane incorporation increased ABCA1 functionality in cholesterol-normal human THP-1 macrophages, likely through a combination of different mechanisms. This beneficial in vitro effect may partly contribute to the cardioprotective effect of a diet enriched with EPA highlighted by several recent clinical trials.",

The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is emerging as a powerful tool to study chronic stress and its mechanisms. Here, we developed a prolonged 11-week chronic unpredictable stress (PCUS) model in zebrafish to more fully mimic chronic stress in human populations. We also examined behavioral and neurochemical alterations in zebrafish, and attempted to modulate these states by 3-week treatment with an antidepressant fluoxetine, a neuroprotective omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a pro-inflammatory endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and their combinations. Overall, PCUS induced severe anxiety and elevated norepinephrine levels, whereas fluoxetine (alone or combined with other agents) corrected most of these behavioral deficits. While EPA and LPS alone had little effects on the zebrafish PCUS-induced anxiety behavior, both fluoxetine (alone or in combination) and EPA restored norepinephrine levels, whereas LPS + EPA increased dopamine levels. As these data support the validity of PCUS as an effective tool to study stress-related pathologies in zebrafish, further research is needed into the ability of various conventional and novel treatments to modulate behavioral and neurochemical biomarkers of chronic stress in this model organism.",

To determine whether the fatty acid composition of diet modulates leukocyte function and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, we examined the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on the pathology of lupus in drug-induced and spontaneous mouse models. We found that dietary EPA supplementation ameliorated representative lupus manifestations, including autoantibody production and immunocomplex deposition in the kidneys. A combination of lipidomic and membrane dynamics analyses revealed that EPA remodels the lipid composition and fluidity of B cell membranes, thereby preventing B cell differentiation into autoantibody-producing plasma cells. These results highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism by which fatty acid composition affects B cell differentiation into autoantibody-producing plasma cells during autoimmunity, and imply that EPA supplementation may be beneficial for therapy of lupus.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the eicosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid (EPA/AA) ratio and long-term cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Methods We identified a total of 831 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and whose EPA/AA ratio was available. The patients were divided into two groups according to their serum EPA/AA ratio (median, 0.29; interquartile range 0.19-0.47): those in the lower quartile of EPA/AA ratios (Low EPA/AA group; n=231) and all other subjects (High EPA/AA group; n=600). The primary endpoints included a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. Results Patients in the Low EPA/AA group were significantly younger (66.0±12.6 years vs. 69.9±9.3 years, p<0.001), current smokers (33.3% vs. 22.7%, p=0.002), and had a history of myocardial infarction (20.3% vs. 12.3%, p=0.003). During the follow-up (median, 1,206 days; interquartile range, 654-1,910 days), the occurrence of the primary endpoint was significantly higher in the Low EPA/AA group than in the High EPA/AA group. Of note, the rate of cardiovascular death was significantly higher in the Low EPA/AA group, and the rates of myocardial infarction and stroke tended to be higher. Conclusion A low EPA/AA ratio was associated with long-term adverse cardiovascular events in Japanese patients with coronary artery disease.",

Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on T-helper type 1 (Th1) cell responses and identify the pathways associated with these responses. Naïve CD4+ T cells were co-cultured with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) in the presence or absence of palmitate (PA), DHA, or EPA. DHA or EPA treatment lowered the number of differentiated IFN-γ-positive cells and inhibited the secretion of IFN-γ, whereas only DHA increased IL-2 and reduced TNF-α secretion. There was reduced expression of MHC II on DCs after DHA or EPA treatment. In the DC-independent model, DHA and EPA reduced Th1 cell differentiation and lowered the cell number. DHA and EPA markedly inhibited IFN-γ secretion, while only EPA reduced TNF-α secretion. Microarray analysis identified pathways involved in inflammation, immunity, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Moreover, DHA and EPA inhibited Th1 cells through the regulation of diverse pathways and genes, including Igf1 and Cpt1a. Our results showed that DHA and EPA had largely comparable inhibitory effects on Th1 cell differentiation. However, each of the fatty acids also had distinct effects on specific cytokine secretion, particularly according to the presence of DCs. [BMB Reports 2021; 54(5): 278-283].",

METHODS AND RESULTS: This post hoc subanalysis of the HIJ-PROPER study included PUFA-naïve patients for whom EPA/AA ratio data were available at baseline and after 3 months. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on the median %ΔEPA/AA ratio: Group 1, change less than the median; and Group 2, change greater than or equal to the median. The 3-year rates of the primary endpoint, a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and unstable angina pectoris, were compared between the 2 groups. The median %ΔEPA/AA ratio in Groups 1 and 2 was -26.2% (n=482 patients [49.9%]) and 42.2% (n=483 patients [50.1%]), respectively.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The oncogenic Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation was reported to be the signature genetic event in most cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Hepassocin (HPS/FGL1) is involved in regulating lipid metabolism and the progression of several cancer types; however, the underlying mechanism of HPS/FGL1 in the KRAS mutant PDAC cells undergoing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) treatment remains unclear. METHODS: We measured HPS/FGL1 protein expressions in a human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPNE) normal pancreas cell line, a KRAS-wild-type PDAC cell line (BxPC-3), and KRAS-mutant PDAC cell lines (PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and SUIT-2) by Western blot methods. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with corresponding KRAS-expressing plasmids to examine the level of HPS expression with KRAS activation. We knocked-down HPS/FGL1 using lentiviral vectors in SUIT-2 cells and measured the cell viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and clonogenicity assays. Furthermore, a lipidomic analysis was performed to profile changes in lipid metabolism after HPS/FGL1 knockdown. RESULTS: We found that the HPS/FGL1 level was significantly upregulated in KRAS-mutated PDAC cells and was involved in KRAS/phosphorylated (p)-signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, and the knockdown of HPS/FGL1 in SUIT-2 cells decreased cell proliferation through increasing G2/M cell cycle arrest and cyclin B1 expression. In addition, the knockdown of HPS/FGL1 in SUIT-2 cells significantly increased omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and EPA production but not docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Moreover, EPA treatment in SUIT-2 cells reduced the expression of de novo lipogenic protein, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC)-1, and decreased p-STAT3 and HPS/FGL1 expressions, resulting in the suppression of cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study indicate that HPS is highly expressed by KRAS-mutated PDAC cells, and HPS/FGL1 plays a crucial role in altering lipid metabolism and increasing cell growth in pancreatic cancer. EPA supplements could potentially inhibit or reduce ACC-1-involved lipogenesis and HPS/FGL1-mediated cell survival in KRAS-mutated pancreatic cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Grape seed procyanidin extract (GSE) has been shown to exert antineoplastic properties in preclinical studies. Recently, we reported findings from a modified phase I, open-label, dose escalation clinical study conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD, and potential chemopreventive effects of leucoselect phytosome, a standardized GSE complexed with soy phospholipids to enhance bioavailability, in heavy active and former smokers. Three months of leucoselect phytosome treatment significantly decreased bronchial Ki-67 labeling index (LI), a marker of cell proliferation on the bronchial epithelium. Because GSE is widely used as a supplement to support cardiovascular health, we evaluate the impact of oral leucoselect phytosome on the fasting serum complex lipid metabolomics profiles in our participants. One month of leucoselect phytosome treatment significantly increased eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) with well-established anticancer properties. Leucoselect phytosome also significantly increased unsaturated phosphatidylcholines (PC), likely from soy phospolipids in the phytosome and functioning as transporters for these PUFAs. Furthermore, 3-month leucoselect phytosome treatment significantly increased serum prostaglandin (PG) E3 (PGE3), a metabolite of EPA with anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic properties. Such increases in PGE3 correlated with reductions of bronchial Ki-67 LI (r = -0.9; P = 0.0374). Moreover, posttreatment plasma samples from trial participants significantly inhibited proliferation of human lung cancer cell lines A549 (adenocarcinoma), H520 (squamous cell carcinoma), DMS114 (small cell carcinoma), and 1198 (preneoplastic cell line). Our findings further support the potential utility of leucoselect phytosome in reducing cardiovascular and neoplastic risks in heavy former and active smokers. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: In this correlative study of leucoselect phytosome for lung cancer chemoprevention in heavy active and former smokers, we demonstrate for the first time, favorable modulations of n-3PUFA and downstream PGE3 in fasting serum, further supporting the chemopreventive potential of leucoselect phytosome against lung cancer.",

However, its efficacy and safety with regard to cancer cells remain unclear. The present study comprised an In Vitro investigation of the effects of EPA on cancers. The effects of 0.01-300 μg/mL of EPA on the proliferation and death of cells after 24, 48, and 72 h were explored. The study included cell lines representing neuroblastoma (Kelly, SH-SY5Y, C1300); acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); Burkitt's lymphoma; acute myeloid leukemia (AML); adult cancer cell lines of the pancreas, colon, and prostate; and a fibroblast cell line. EPA caused 4.4%-7% proliferation of fibroblasts, but did not protect them from the toxic effect of cisplatin. It did not induce proliferation in the neuroblastoma cells, and did not reduce the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin. EPA also did not cause proliferation in ALL, Burkitt's lymphoma, and AML cells, and did not alter the cytotoxic effects of L-asparaginase, cyclophosphamide, and cytosine arabinoside, respectively. Our results were similar in the adult cancer cell lines. EPA is safe because it has no effects on the proliferation of cancer cells or on chemotherapy In Vitro.",

      "abstract": "Oleic acid (OA), a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), has previously been shown to reverse saturated fatty acid palmitic acid (PA)-induced hepatic insulin resistance (IR). However, its underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. In addition, previous studies have shown that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), reverses PA-induced muscle IR, but whether EPA plays the same role in hepatic IR and its possible mechanism involved need to be further clarified. Here, we confirmed that EPA reversed PA-induced IR in HepG2 cells and compared the proteomic changes in HepG2 cells after treatment with different free fatty acids (FFAs). A total of 234 proteins were determined to be differentially expressed after PA+OA treatment. Their functions were mainly related to responses to stress and endogenous stimuli, lipid metabolic process, and protein binding. For PA+EPA treatment, the PA-induced expression changes of 1326 proteins could be reversed by EPA, 415 of which were mitochondrial proteins, with most of the functional proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Mechanistic studies revealed that the protein encoded by JUN and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in OA- and EPA-reversed PA-induced IR, respectively. EPA and OA alleviated PA-induced abnormal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, ROS generation, and calcium (Ca2+) content. Importantly, H2O2-activated production of ROS increased the protein expression of JUN, further resulting in IR in HepG2 cells. Taken together, we demonstrate that ROS/JUN is a common response pathway employed by HepG2 cells toward FFA-regulated IR.",
