      "abstract": "Tic disorder is a class of nervous system diseases characterized by involuntary muscle contraction, and its pathogenesis is complex. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of action of GFAP in tic disorder and its potential influence on neuroprotection and behavior improvement. The expression level of GFAP in brain tissues of each group was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the changes of tic behavior were evaluated by behavioral tests. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the expression of GFAP and related signaling pathway proteins and mRNA, in order to reveal the molecular mechanism of GFAP. Behavioral tests showed that the frequency and intensity of convulsions in the GFAP intervention group were lower than those in the non-intervention group, indicating that GFAP had a certain neuroprotective effect. Through molecular biological analysis, we found that GFAP may exert its neuroprotective effects by modulating signaling pathways related to inflammatory responses, for example, the NF- κ B signaling pathway. The GFAP intervention group was also significantly lower in the level of neuronal damage markers than in the no-intervention group, which further confirmed the neuroprotective effect of GFAP.",

This indole alkaloid primarily acts as an antagonist of α2-adrenergic receptors. Initially recognized for its purported aphrodisiac properties, yohimbine has been investigated for a wide range of applications, including sports or the treatment of erectile dysfunction and metabolic disorders. However, toxicological concerns exist, particularly at higher doses. Ongoing researches help to fully assess yohimbine's efficacy and safety profile and to explore strategies for enhancing its bioavailability and reducing toxicity. This review examines the multifaceted nature of yohimbine, delving into both its promising therapeutic potential and the associated risks.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disorder characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix and collagen, resulting in significant parenchymal scarring and respiratory failure that leads to mortality. Yohimbine (YBH) is an α-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-fibrotic activity of YBH against LPS/TGF-β-induced differentiation in BEAS-2B/LL29 cells and bleomycin (BLMN) induced pulmonary fibrosis model in rats. Network pharmacology, gene expression, Western-blot analysis, immune-cytochemistry/immunohistochemistry, lung functional analysis, and histology techniques were used to assess the fibrotic marker expression/levels in cells or rat lung tissues. YBH treatment significantly attenuated the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory (identified through a network-pharmacology approach) and oxidative stress markers expression in lung epithelial cells. TGF-β stimulation significantly elevated the fibrotic cascade of markers and treatment with YBH attenuated these markers' expression/levels. Intra-tracheal administration of BLMN caused a significant elevation of various inflammatory/oxidative stress and fibrotic markers expression in lung tissues and treatment with YBH significantly mitigated the same. Ashcroft score analysis revealed that BLMN exhibited severe distortion of the lungs, elevation of thickness of the alveolar walls and accumulation of collagen in tissues, further treatment with YBH significantly suppressed these events and improved the lung architecture. Lung functional parameters demonstrated that BLMN-induced stiffness and resistance were reduced considerably upon YBH treatment and restored lung function dose-dependently. Overall, this study reveals that YBH treatment significantly attenuated the BLMN-induced fibrosis by regulating the MAPK pathway and provided insightful information for progressing towards translational outcomes.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Clomipramine (CLOMI) has shown effectiveness in treating premature ejaculation but is linked to erectile dysfunction and reduced libido. Yohimbine (YOH), by contrast, is effective in treating erectile dysfunction and may improve libido. Combining CLOMI and YOH could potentially leverage the benefits of both drugs. This study aimed to investigate the interactions between these drugs and to evaluate their safety profile. METHODS: A prospective, open-labelled, single-centre, pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction study was performed in 15 healthy male subjects. Single-dose and steady-state PK were investigated using noncompartmental analysis after mono- and combination therapy of the 2 orally applied drugs. Plasma sampling was performed at baseline, 0.5 (YOH), 1, 1.5 (YOH), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h (CLOMI). Differences in the area under the curve after multiple dosing (MD) were determined using an equivalence boundary of 80-125%. RESULTS: The geometric mean ratio of the area under the curve up to 12 h for MD CLOMI (combination vs. monotherapy) was 112% (90% confidence interval: 104-120%), whereas for MD YOH this ratio was 137% (90% confidence interval: 112-168%). The study drugs were safe and well tolerated as mono- and combination therapy, with no major adverse events reported. CONCLUSION: A PK assessment of clomipramine and yohimbine indicated a clinically significant drug-drug interaction for MD YOH in combination with CLOMI. This might be explained by competitive, CLOMI-related inhibition of YOH metabolism, probably mediated by cytochrome P450 2D6. However, according to European Medicines Agency guidelines, the effect can be classified as interaction absent (<1,25 fold) or minor (>1.25-<2-fold). Given the complimentary mechanisms of action and the favourable safety profiles, the findings pave the way for future efficacy studies.",

      "abstract": "Yohimbine is a potent bioactive indole alkaloid, isolated from a variety of biological sources and has long been used as a natural stimulant and aphrodisiac, particularly to treat erectile dysfunction. However, some literature also points toward its anticancer effect in different experimental models. The current study aimed to address a clinical concern on the therapeutic utilization of yohimbine as a repurposed drug. We employed 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis model juxtaposed with biochemical investigation of several detoxification and antioxidant markers, such as Cyt p450, Cyt b5, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S transferase (GST), DT-diaphorase, vitamin C, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The immunohistochemical assessment of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and cyclin D1 expression were also performed to observe the effect of yohimbine on these markers. The hamsters treated with DMBA presented the growth of tumors in the buccal pouches, accompanied by significant changes in the liver and buccal mucosa levels of Phase I & II detoxification enzymes and lipid peroxidation (LPO). A significant rise in the range of 2- to 3.5-fold was observed in Cyt p450, Cyt b5, and LPO in DMBA-treated animals. However, oral administration of yohimbine significantly restored the LPO, antioxidant, and detoxifying enzyme activities. Additionally, the levels of COX-2, IL-6, PCNA, and cyclin D1 were also found to be downregulated by yohimbine treatment. In conclusion, yohimbine improved the biochemical and immunohistochemical markers of DMBA-induced oral cancer and reverted to near normal values via ameliorating the underlying inflammation and oxidative stress conditions. Our study highlighted the potential of yohimbine as anticancer agent, especially against oral cancer and suggested its possible use as repurposed drug.",

      "abstract": "Yohimbine (YHB) has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardiac function-enhancing properties. Additionally, it has been reported to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and neointimal formation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation by suppressing the phospholipase C-gamma 1 pathway. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of YHB controlling the behavior of VSMCs is not fully understood. In this study, YHB downregulated the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and cyclin E, by modulating the transcription factor FOXO3a in VSMCs induced by PDGF. Furthermore, YHB decreased p-38 and mTOR phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, YHB significantly reduced the phosphorylation at Y397 and Y925 sites of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and this effect was greater at the Y925 site than Y397. In addition, the expression of paxillin, a FAK-associated protein known to bind to the Y925 site of FAK, was significantly reduced by YHB treatment in a dose-dependent manner. A pronounced reduction in the migration and proliferation of VSMCs was observed following co-treatment of YHB with mTOR or p38 inhibitors. In conclusion, this study shows that YHB inhibits the PDGF-induced proliferation and migration of VSMCs by regulating the transcription factor FOXO3a and the mTOR/p38/FAK signaling pathway. Therefore, YHB may be a potential therapeutic candidate for preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis.",

The present study aims to investigate the influence of the stress neuromodulators, norepinephrine and cortisol, on selective attention processes to fearful faces and its neuronal activation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. 167 healthy men between 18 and 35 years (mean [SD] age: 25.23 [4.24] years) participated in the study. Participants received either: (A) yohimbine (n= 41), (B) hydrocortisone (n = 41), (C) yohimbine and hydrocortisone (n = 42) or (D) placebo only (n= 43) and participated in a dot-probe task with fearful and neutral faces in an fMRI scanner. RESULTS: We found an attentional bias toward fearful faces across all groups and related neuronal activation in the left cuneus. We did not find any differences between experimental treatment groups in selective attention and its neuronal activation. DISCUSSION: Our results provide evidence that fearful faces lead to an attentional bias with related neuronal activation in the left cuneus. We did not replicate formerly reported activation in the amygdala, intraparietal sulcus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. Suitability of the dot-probe task for fMRI studies and insignificant treatment effects are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Acute myocarditis, also known as myocardial inflammation, is a self-limited condition caused by systemic infection with cardiotropic pathogens, primarily viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Despite significant research, inflammatory cardiomyopathy exacerbated by heart failure, arrhythmia, or left ventricular dysfunction and it has a dismal prognosis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of yohimbine against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced myocarditis in rat model. The anti-inflammatory activity of yohimbine was assessed in in-vitro using RAW 264.7 and H9C2 cells. Myocarditis was induced in rats by injecting LPS (10 mg/kg), following the rats were treated with dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) or yohimbine (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) for 12 h and their therapeutic activity was examined using various techniques. Yohimbine treatment significantly attenuated the LPS-mediated inflammatory markers expression in the in-vitro model. In-vivo studies proved that yohimbine treatment significantly reduced the LPS-induced increase of cardiac-specific markers, inflammatory cell counts, and pro-inflammatory markers expression compared to LPS-control samples. LPS administration considerably affected the ECG, RR, PR, QRS, QT, ST intervals, and hemodynamic parameters, and caused abnormal pathological parameters, in contrast, yohimbine treatment substantially improved the cardiac parameters, mitigated the apoptosis in myocardial cells and ameliorated the histopathological abnormalities that resulted in an improved survival rate. LPS-induced elevation of cardiac troponin-I, myeloperoxidase, CD-68, and neutrophil elastase levels were significantly attenuated upon yohimbine treatment. Further investigation showed that yohimbine exerts an anti-inflammatory effect partly by modulating the MAPK pathway. This study emphasizes yohimbine's therapeutic benefit against LPS-induced myocarditis and associated inflammatory markers response by regulating the MAPK pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chronic liver injury, caused by various aetiologies, causes recurrent tissue damage, culminating in decreased liver regenerative ability and resulting in fibrosis followed by cirrhosis. In this study, the anti-fibrotic activity of Yohimbine hydrochloride (YHC) was investigated using various in vitro models and in vivo models. METHODS: To assess the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-fibrotic effects of YHC, lipopolysaccharide or TGF-β induced differentiation or lipid-induced oxidative-stress models were employed using HLECs, HSC-LX2, and HepG2 cells. Further, thioacetamide (TAA) induced hepatic inflammation/fibrosis models were utilized to validate the YHC's anti-fibrotic activity in rats. RESULTS: Inflammation/differentiation experiments in HLECs and HSC-LX2 revealed that YHC treatment significantly (p < 0.001) mitigated the lipopolysaccharide or TGF-β induced upregulation of inflammatory and fibrotic markers expression respectively. In addition, YHC dose-dependently reduced the TGF-β induced migration and palmitic acid-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. Further, TAA administration (5 weeks) in vivo rat model showed increased inflammatory marker levels/expression, oxidative stress, and pathological abnormalities. Additionally, TAA administration (9 weeks) elevated the fibrotic marker expression, collagen deposition in liver tissues, and shortened longevity in rats. Treatment with YHC dose-dependently mitigated the TAA-induced abnormalities in both inflammation and fibrosis models and improved the survival of the rats. Further mechanistic approaches revealed that TAA administration elevated the JNK, Wnt components and β-catenin expression in hepatic stellate cells and animal tissues. Further treatment with YHC significantly modulated the JNK/Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, the β-catenin nuclear translocation results showed that β-catenin levels were significantly elevated in the nuclear fraction of TAA control samples and reduced in YHC-treated samples. CONCLUSION: Yohimbine treatment significantly improved inflammation and fibrosis by inhibiting differentiation, oxidative stress, and collagen deposition by partly modulating the JNK/Wnt/β-catenin pathway. These results might serve as a foundation for proposing yohimbine as a potential lead compound for liver fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Degeneration of the noradrenergic system is now considered a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but little is known about its consequences in terms of parkinsonian manifestations. Here, we evaluated two aspects of the noradrenergic system using multimodal in vivo imaging in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls: the pigmented cell bodies of the locus coeruleus with neuromelanin sensitive MRI; and the density of α2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) with PET using 11C-yohimbine. Thirty patients with Parkinson's disease and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were included. The characteristics of the patients' symptoms were assessed using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Patients showed reduced neuromelanin signal intensity in the locus coeruleus compared with controls and diminished 11C-yohimbine binding in widespread cortical regions, including the motor cortex, as well as in the insula, thalamus and putamen. Clinically, locus coeruleus neuronal loss was correlated with motor (bradykinesia, motor fluctuations, tremor) and non-motor (fatigue, apathy, constipation) symptoms. A reduction of α2-AR availability in the thalamus was associated with tremor, while a reduction in the putamen, the insula and the superior temporal gyrus was associated with anxiety. These results highlight a multifaceted alteration of the noradrenergic system in Parkinson's disease since locus coeruleus and α2-AR degeneration were found to be partly uncoupled. These findings raise important issues about noradrenergic dysfunction that may encourage the search for new drugs targeting this system, including α2-ARs, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder is a significant public health concern, further exacerbated by an increased risk of relapse due to stress. In addition, factors such as biological sex may contribute to the progression of addiction, as females are especially susceptible to stress-induced relapse. While there have been many studies surrounding potential pharmacological interventions for male stress-induced ethanol reinstatement, research regarding females is scarce. Recently, the neuropeptide oxytocin has gained interest as a possible pharmacological intervention for relapse. The present study examines how oxytocin affects yohimbine-induced reinstatement of ethanol-seeking in female rats using a self-administration paradigm. Adult female rats were trained to press a lever to access ethanol in daily self-administration sessions. Rats then underwent extinction training before a yohimbine-induced reinstatement test. Rats administered with yohimbine demonstrated significantly higher lever response indicating a reinstatement of ethanol-seeking behavior. Oxytocin administration, both systemically and directly into the central amygdala, attenuated the effect of yohimbine-induced reinstatement of ethanol-seeking behavior. The findings from this study establish that oxytocin is effective at attenuating alcohol-relapse behavior mediated by the pharmacological stressor yohimbine and that this effect is modulated by the central amygdala in females. This provides valuable insight regarding oxytocin's potential therapeutic effect in female stress-induced alcohol relapse."

      "abstract": "Recently, multi-targeted drugs have attracted much attention in cancer therapy where several therapeutic proteins are targeted by a single agent. Using the published scientific literature, we selected sixteen well-known anticancer targets and seven potential phytobioactive chemicals to find a multitargeted compound by screening through molecular docking. The feasible protein-ligand interaction was further predicted by protein-ligand interaction analysis and molecular dynamic simulation. The phytochemical yohimbine exhibited the lowest docking score in the range of -8.3 to -10.0 kcal/mol over other ligands with all the studied protein targets. Molecular interaction data also revealed the feasible binding of yohimbine with all targets. Moreover, the molecular simulation data also confirmed the stability of protein-ligand complexes with three most scored targets viz. ERK2, PARP1 and PIK3α. Based on our results, yohimbine seems to be the most potent compound out of those selected compounds and can be considered as effective lead molecule against the studied target proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The demand for environmentally friendly and cost-effective plant-based products for the development of cancer therapeutics has been increasing. Yohimbine (α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) is a stimulant and aphrodisiac used to improve erectile dysfunction. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anticancer potential of yohimbine in drug-resistant oral cancer KB-ChR-8-5 cells using different biomolecular techniques. METHODS: We estimated the anticancer efficacy of yohimbine using different assays, such as MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cell cytotoxicity, cell morphology, cell apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and modulation in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). RESULTS: Yohimbine showed a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 44 µM against KB-ChR-8-5 cancer cell lines. Yohimbine treatment at 40 µM and 50 µM resulted in a considerable change in cell morphology, including shrinkage, detachment, membrane blebbing, and deformed shape. Moreover, at the dose of IC50 and above, a significant induction was observed in the generation of ROS and depolarization of MMP. The possible mechanisms of action of yohimbine underlying the dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity may be due to the induction of apoptosis, ROS generation, and modulation of MMP. CONCLUSION: Overall, yohimbine showed a significant anticancer potential against drug-resistant oral cancer KB-ChR-8-5 cells. Our study suggests that besides being an aphrodisiac, yohimbine can be used as a drug repurposing agent. However, more research is required in different in vitro and in vivo models to confirm the feasibility of yohimbine in clinics.",

      "abstract": "Even today, talking about sexual dysfunction largely remains a taboo. Therefore less studies have been recorded and fewer remedies given. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is one of the most commonly treated psychological disorders that leads to major distress, interpersonal limitation and reduces the quality of life and marriage. This study aimed to assess a plant-derived molecule, yohimbine (Yoh; a β-carboline indole alkaloid often used for ED treatment) and its potential binding phenomenon with haemoglobin (Hb). Successful binding of Yoh with Hb is evident from spectroscopic and molecular-docking results. Yoh quenched the fluorescence of Hb efficiently through a static mode. The binding affinity was in the order of 105  M-1 with 1:1 stoichiometry. Thermodynamic analyses concluded that the protein-ligand association was spontaneous and was attributed to entropy-driven exothermic binding. Nonpolyelectrolytic factor was the core, dominating factor. Structural aspects were deciphered through infrared spectroscopy and computational methods. The giant 3D-protein moiety was significantly perturbed through drug binding. Hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonding participation were stipulated by molecular modelling data. This study reveals the detailed interaction pattern and molecular mechanism of Hb-Yoh binding, correlating the structure-function relationship for the first time, and therefore holds enormous importance from the standpoint of rational and efficient drug design and development.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperconsolidation of aversive associations and poor extinction learning have been hypothesized to be crucial in the acquisition of pathological fear. Previous animal and human research points to the potential role of the catecholaminergic system, particularly noradrenaline and dopamine, in acquiring emotional memories. Here, we investigated in a between-participants design with 3 groups whether the noradrenergic alpha-2 adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine and the dopaminergic D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride modulate long-term fear conditioning and extinction in humans. METHODS: Fifty-five healthy male students were recruited. The final sample consisted of n = 51 participants who were explicitly aware of the contingencies between conditioned stimuli (CS) and unconditioned stimuli after fear acquisition. The participants were then randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups and received either yohimbine (10 mg, n = 17), sulpiride (200 mg, n = 16), or placebo (n = 18) between fear acquisition and extinction. Recall of conditioned (non-extinguished CS+ vs CS-) and extinguished fear (extinguished CS+ vs CS-) was assessed 1 day later, and a 64-channel electroencephalogram was recorded. RESULTS: The yohimbine group showed increased salivary alpha-amylase activity, confirming a successful manipulation of central noradrenergic release. Elevated fear-conditioned bradycardia and larger differential amplitudes of the N170 and late positive potential components in the event-related brain potential indicated that yohimbine treatment (compared with a placebo and sulpiride) enhanced fear recall during day 2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that yohimbine potentiates cardiac and central electrophysiological signatures of fear memory consolidation. They thereby elucidate the key role of noradrenaline in strengthening the consolidation of conditioned fear associations, which may be a key mechanism in the etiology of fear-related disorders.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a single acute dose of yohimbine hydrochloride on repeated anaerobic sprint ability. Physically active females (n = 18) completed two separate repeated supramaximal sprint trials each with a different single-dose treatment: placebo (PL; gluten-free corn starch) or yohimbine hydrochloride (YHM; 2.5 mg). For each trial, participants consumed their respective treatment 20 min before exercise. Following a warm-up, participants completed 3 × 15 s Wingate anaerobic tests (WAnTs) separated by 2 min of active recovery. A capillary blood sample was obtained pre- and immediately post-exercise to measure blood concentrations of lactate (LA), epinephrine (EPI), and norepinephrine (NE). Heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured following each WAnT. Findings showed that mean power (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.024), total work (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.061), and HR (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.046), were significantly higher with YHM supplementation versus PL. Fatigue index (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.054) and post-exercise LA (p < 0.001; d = 1.26) were significantly lower with YHM compared to PL. YHM resulted in significantly higher EPI concentrations versus PL (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.225) pre- and post-exercise while NE only increased as a function of time (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.227) and was unaffected by treatment. While RPE increased after each WAnT, no differences between treatments were observed (p = 0.539; η2 < 0.001). Together, these results suggest that acute YHM ingestion imparts ergogenic benefits which may be mediated by lower blood LA and fatigue concomitantly occurring with blood EPI increases. Thus, YHM may improve sprint performance although more mechanistic study is warranted to accentuate underlying processes mediating performance enhancement.",

However, several studies suggested that the aphrodisiac effects of the extract were only a placebo or due to the increase in peripheral vascular congestion. In contrast, other studies reported that it could provide excellent curative effects on organic impotence. We aimed to review the efficacy of Yohimbine as a pharmacological treatment for ED and performed a comprehensive systematic search of published articles in PubMed and Science Direct databases for eligible randomized controlled trials comparing Yohimbine to placebo or no treatment for ED patients. A total of eight studies out of 543 studies were included in this review. Both Yohimbine alone (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 2.08, 95% CI 1.30-3.32, P ¼ .002) and combined (OR ¼ 6.35, 95% CI 3.01-13.41, P < .001) showed a significantly greater probability of erectile function improvement compared to the placebo group (OR ¼ 2.87, 95% CI 1.94-4.25, P < .001). Yohimbine alone did not show a significant difference in the rate of improved sexual function (P ¼ .07); however, the pooled results of both subgroups indicated a higher rate of improved sexual function (OR ¼ 2.65, 95% CI 1.43-4.92, P ¼ .002). Sole administration of Yohimbine and its combination with other supplements can improve the erectile function in ED patients. However, it is not able to improve the sexual function if not combined with other treatments."

Natural compounds with great efficacy and few side effects are in high demand due to the global rise in MDD and ineffective treatment. Yohimbine, a natural compound, has been used to treat various ailments, including neurological conditions, since ancient times. Serotonergic neurotransmission plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression; thus, serotonergic receptor agonist/antagonistic drugs are promising anti-depressants. Yohimbine was investigated in this study to determine its antidepressant activity using molecular docking and pharmacokinetic analyses. Additionally, the in silico mutational study was carried out to understand the increase in therapeutic efficiency using site-directed mutagenesis. Conformational changes and fluctuations occurring during wild type and mutant serotonergic receptor, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors 1A (5HT1A) and yohimbine were assessed by molecular dynamics MD simulation studies. Yohimbine was found to satisfy all the parameters for drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics analysis. It was found to possess a good dock score and hydrogen-bond interactions with wild type 5HT1A structure. Our findings elaborate the substantial efficacy of yohimbine against MDD; however, further bench work studies may be carried out to prove the same.",

      "abstract": "Yohimbine is a highly selective and potent α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, which is usually treated as an adjunction for impotence, as well for weight loss and natural bodybuilding aids. However, it was recently reported that Yohimbine causes myocardial injury and controversial results were reported in the setting of cardiac diseases. Here, we used human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as a model system to explore electrophysiologic characterization after exposure to Yohimbine. HiPSC-CMs were differentiated by employment of inhibitory Wnt compounds. For analysis of electrophysiological properties, conventional whole-cell patch-clamp recording was used. Specifically, spontaneous action potentials, pacemaker currents (If), sodium (Na+) channel (INa), and calcium (Ca++) channel currents (ICa) were assessed in hiPSC-CMs after exposure to Yohimbine. HiPSC-CMs expressed sarcomeric-α-actinin and MLC2V proteins, as well as exhibited ventricular-like spontaneous action potential waveform. Yohimbine inhibited frequency of hiPSC-CMs spontaneous action potentials and significantly prolonged action potential duration in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, rest potential, threshold potential, amplitude, and maximal diastolic potential were decreased, whereas APD50/APD90 was prolonged. Yohimbine inhibited the amplitude of INa in low doses (IC50 = 14.2 μM, n = 5) and inhibited ICa in high doses (IC50 = 139.7 μM, n = 5). Whereas Yohimbine did not affect the activation curves, treatment resulted in left shifts in inactivation curves of both Na+ and Ca++ channels. Here, we show that Yohimbine induces direct cardiotoxic effects on spontaneous action potentials of INa and ICa in hiPSC-CMs. Importantly, these effects were not mediated by α2-adrenoceptor signaling. Our results strongly suggest that Yohimbine directly and negatively affects electrophysiological properties of human cardiomyocytes. These findings are highly relevant for potential application of Yohimbine in patients with atrioventricular conduction disorder.",

Unfortunately, current treatment options for BPH primarily seek to address the lower urinary tract dysfunction aspect of the disease and do not improve sexual function. Yohimbine has been effectively used for decades to treat erectile dysfunction. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory eﬀect of yohimbine on BPH and explore the associated underlying mechanisms. Thirty-six rats were randomly divided into the control, BPH, finasteride (1 mg/kg), and yohimbine (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg) groups. Except for the rats in the control group, those in the other groups were subcutaneously injected testosterone propionate (5 mg/kg/day) daily for a period of 4 weeks to establish BPH models. They were also administration the corresponding drug daily for a period of 6 weeks. After the treatments, in addition to determining prostate wet weight and index, the histopathological status of the prostate was observed, and the levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, prostatic acid phosphatase, the prostate-specific antigen, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and steroid 5α-reductase were determined. Specifically, the administration of 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg yohimbine inhibited prostatic index increase by 46.7, 55.1, and 69.3%, respectively, in BHP rats. Further, yohimbine signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of dihydrotestosterone, prostatic acid phosphatase, prostate-specific antigen, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and steroid 5α-reductase, suggesting that it exerts beneficial effects against BPH by modulating the steroid 5α-reductase pathway.",

This report presents four simultaneous severe poisoning/death cases caused by yohimbine. The test samples comprised the venous blood of four middle-aged men (aged 47-65) who were suspected of poisoning; one of the men died due to ineffective rescue. Ethanol concentration determination and toxicological routine screening were performed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A specific LC-MS/MS method was developed to quantify yohimbine, which showed concentrations of 459, 249, and 301ng/mL in three poisoned blood samples and concentrations as high as 5631ng/mL in the deceased. Moreover, the deceased's autopsy ruled out death from trauma and previous illness, and no other common toxic components were detected in his blood. Therefore, yohimbine poisoning appears to be the most likely cause of death. As a type of alkaloid that can be employed in the treatment of clinical diseases and additives for supplements, the danger of yohimbine should be of widespread concern in society.",

      "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest protein superfamily in the human genome. GPCRs play key roles in mediating a wide variety of physiological events including proliferation and cancer metastasis. Given the major roles that GPCRs play in mediating cancer growth, they present promising targets for small molecule therapeutics. One of the principal goals of our lab is to identify complex natural products (NPs) suitable for ring distortion, or the dramatic altering of the inherently complex architectures of NPs, to rapidly generate an array of compounds with diverse molecular skeletal systems. The overarching goal of our ring distortion approach is to re-program the biological activity of select natural products and identify new compounds of importance to the treatment of disease, such as cancer. Described herein are the results from biological screens of diverse small molecules derived from the indole alkaloid yohimbine against a panel of GPCRs involved in various diseases. Several analogues displayed highly differential antagonistic activities across the GPCRs tested. We highlight the re-programmed profile of one analogue, Y7g, which exhibited selective antagonistic activities against AVPR2 (IC50 = 459 nM) and OXTR (IC50 = 1.16 µM). The activity profile of Y7g could correlate its HIF-dependent anti-cancer activity to its GPCR antagonism since these receptors are known to be upregulated in hypoxic cellular environments. Our findings demonstrate that the ring distortion of yohimbine can lead to the identification of new compounds capable of interacting with distinct cancer-relevant targets.",

We previously revealed that yohimbine, an α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, has protective effects on renal ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced AKI in rats. This study aimed to investigate the renoprotective effect of yohimbine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI in rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following groups: Sham-operated group, LPS (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and LPS + yohimbine (0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Kidney functional parameters of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma creatinine (Pcr) were aggravated in the LPS group. Administration of LPS decreased blood pressure. In addition, kidney injury molecule-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and expression of various cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and interleukin (IL)-6 were increased by LPS administration. Yohimbine treatment clearly ameliorated the damaged kidney function and low blood pressure due to LPS. Moreover, yohimbine suppressed cytokine mRNA and iNOS expression enhanced by LPS. However, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 mRNA levels were augmented by yohimbine. Nuclear localization of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in the kidney was observed 1 h after injection of LPS in rats. Yohimbine blocked the nuclear localization of NF-κB. In addition, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) were enhanced with yohimbine. These results suggest that yohimbine can prevent LPS-induced sepsis associated with kidney injury by suppressing inflammatory cytokine and iNOS expression as well as enhancing IL-10 expression via ERK/CREB phosphorylation.",

This can give an estimation for the size of the pharmaceutical and counterfeit products industry for the next few years. Meanwhile, green analytical chemistry forced itself to decrease the massive environmental pollution and hence new analytical methodologies are needed to replace the old ones that consume large amounts of hazardous solvents. In this research, two new methods were validated for determination of seven recognized drugs used in treatment of male impotence, premature ejaculation as well as enhancing sexual libido by HPLC on RP-C18 core-shell particulate and monolithic columns. The study was extended to compare the capabilities of those stationary phases to accommodate greener chromatography concepts without loss of efficiency. Both morphologies shortened the analysis time relative to the previously reported conventional HPLC methods by different approaches. Core-shell particles had higher efficiency in terms of theoretical plates' number and enhanced resolution power which enabled lower detection limits. However, the monolithic column had lower column backpressure which enabled the use of ethanol as a greener alternative solvent at even higher flow rates. The methods were finally applied successfully for the determination of drugs under study in pharmaceutical dosage forms, counterfeit products and in human plasma."

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders represent an extensive socioeconomic burden, yet effective treatment options are suboptimal. A major hurdle in treating alcohol use disorders is the high rate of relapse. Stress is a major factor that promotes relapse in abstinent drug users; therefore, understanding neural mechanisms that underpin the effects of stress on alcohol seeking is critical. In rodent models of stress-induced relapse, the α2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, is a widely used chemical stressor to elicit reinstatement of drug/alcohol seeking. However, the exact mechanism how yohimbine precipitates reinstatement of alcohol seeking and the pattern of neural activation associated with yohimbine-induced reinstatement is poorly understood. Therefore, we counted Fos-protein positive nuclei across 42 brain regions in alcohol-experienced alcohol preferring rats that received either yohimbine in the home-cage (1 mg/kg i.p.) or following yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. The number of Fos-protein positive nuclei was increased in the prefrontal cortex and extended amygdala after home-cage yohimbine compared to naïve- and vehicle-treated rats. Yohimbine-induced reinstatement increased the number of Fos-protein expressing nuclei in multiple other regions including the thalamus, hypothalamus and hippocampus. We then examined inter-regional correlations in Fos-protein expression for all 42 brain regions, which showed Fos expression was more strongly positively correlated following yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking, compared to home-cage yohimbine. These data suggest low-dose yohimbine in a non-drug-associated context activates stress/impulsivity centres within the brain, whereas yohimbine in the drug-associated context recruits additional brain regions to drive alcohol seeking.",

Yet, empirical results have not been conclusive with respect to two pharmacological agents, yohimbine hydrochloride (YOH) and propranolol. YOH is suggested to enhance emotional memory by elevating norepinephrine, whereas the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol might help better cope with feared situations by reducing accompanying bodily sensations. METHODS: In this controlled trial, fifty-six participants with specific phobia were randomly assigned to either 1) virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) plus YOH, 2) VRET plus Propranolol, or 3) VRET plus placebo. Participants in all conditions received three sessions of VRET over a period of two weeks. RESULTS: We conducted 2 × 3 repeated measures MANOVA's. Results showed a significant effect for time, with partial eta squared ranging from ηp2 = 0.647 to ηp2 = 0.692, for specific phobia, yet no significant interaction effects were found. CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found when VRET with YOH or a beta-blocker was compared to VRET with a non-active placebo.

      "abstract": "The alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, yohimbine, can facilitate fear extinction in animals and humans. One potential mechanism is increased noradrenergic activity and associated arousal in the presence of conditioned stimuli. Accordingly, yohimbine might augment prolonged exposure (PE) therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where heightened exposure-oriented arousal is a theorized driver and empirical predictor of treatment success. A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial (NCT 01031979) piloted yohimbine augmentation in 26 males with combat-related PTSD. Participants were given one-time dose of yohimbine or placebo prior to the first imaginal exposure. Subsequently, both arms completed standard PE. The primary outcome was trauma-cued heart-rate reactivity a week after the drug/exposure visit, a highly specified, objective measure sensitive to incremental change. Secondary outcomes included arousal during the drug/exposure visit and slope of distress, PTSD, and depression over the course of PE. Consistent with hypothesis, yohimbine led to higher objective and subjective arousal during the drug/exposure visit and to lower trauma-cued heart-rate reactivity one-week later. One dose of yohimbine also led to greater between-session habituation and more rapid improvement on depression, but not PTSD, over the course of care. Results of this controlled pilot indicate support for continued investigation of yohimbine-augmented exposure therapy for PTSD.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing disease characterized by maladaptive patterns of alcohol drinking and seeking. Though sex differences exist in the etiology of AUD, much remains to be elucidated concerning the mechanisms underlying sex-related vulnerability to developing excessive alcohol-motivated behavior. While a large body of evidence points to an important role of circulating gonadal hormones in mediating cocaine reinforcement, findings are less consistent with respect to ethanol. Critically, the effects of gonadal hormones on the reinstatement of ethanol seeking, a model of \"craving\"-like behavior that reveals pronounced sex differences, has not yet been examined. Thus, the goal of the present experiment was to directly compare manipulations of gonadal hormones in male and female rats on ethanol-motivated behavior. Rats received sham or gonadectomy surgery with or without hormone replacement prior to and throughout three weeks of operant ethanol self-administration to determine the effects of chronically high or low gonadal hormone levels on ethanol drinking. Hormone treatment ceased during extinction training, and the effects of an acute injection of either testosterone (in males) or estradiol (in females) on cue+yohimbine-induced reinstatement of ethanol seeking was determined. Separate groups of gonadally-intact female rats went through similar training, but the effects of either the antiestrogen, fulvestrant, the selective estrogen receptor modulator, clomiphene, or the estrogen receptor β antagonist, PHTPP, on the reinstatement of ethanol seeking were determined. Chronic estradiol replacement produced significant increases in ethanol drinking in female rats, while chronic testosterone significantly decreased ethanol drinking in male rats. Gonadectomy alone only produced modest shifts in drinking towards the opposite-sex pattern, and did not eliminate the robust sex differences that persisted regardless of hormone manipulations. Neither prior chronic nor acute hormone manipulations altered cue+yohimbine-induced reinstatement of ethanol seeking, though blockade of estrogen receptors tended to reduce reinstatement in gonadally-intact females. Overall, our findings indicate that gonadal hormones at least partially mediate, but do not totally account for the sex differences evident in ethanol self-administration, and circulating gonadal hormones have little effect on the reinstatement of ethanol seeking. These results provide a foundation for future studies examining the neuronal mechanisms underlying sex differences in ethanol drinking and seeking.",

Several formulations containing yohimbine salts, yohimbe bark power or extract are marketed worldwide. Determination of the amount of yohimbine in such formulation is a challenging task due to their complex nature. Extraction followed by acid-base purification resulted in a relatively pure alkaloids containing fractions. The exact amounts of yohimbine free base in different formulations were determined by densitometric HPTLC validated methods using silica gel TLC plates. Standard curve for yohimbine was generated using yohimbine hydrochloride subjected to the same acid-base treatment as the used samples. All formulations found to contain yohimbine though some with less concentration than the labeled amount.",

      "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex and the amygdala are critical for the emotional guidance of behavior and are believed to be a site of action for many anxiolytics and anxiogenics. Despite extensive studies examining how these drugs affect behavior, there is little information regarding their effects on neuronal activity. Additionally, with recent recognition of anxiety as a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease, it is unknown if activity in the cortex and the amygdala is altered. Previously, we reported that hemiparkinsonian rats had higher baseline anxiety-like behavior and diminished responsiveness to the acute anxiolytic, diazepam. In contrast, sham-lesioned rats exhibited anxiolytic behavior to diazepam. In this study, we monitored in vivo single-unit spiking activity simultaneously from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in anesthetized sham-lesioned and hemiparkinsonian rats to unmask neuro-circuits underpinning the difference in diazepam responsiveness. We found that baseline spiking activity in the ACC was the same in both sham and hemiparkinsonian rats. We also noted a similar phenomenon for baseline activity in the BLA between sham and hemiparkinsonian rats. However, neuronal spiking activity after diazepam administration (1.5mg/kg, SubQ) was lower than in controls in the ACC of sham-lesioned rats whereas no difference was noted after diazepam treatment in hemiparkinsonian rats. BLA neuronal spiking activity was unaffected by diazepam administration in either animal group. On the other hand, yohimbine treatment (5mg/kg, SubQ) coincided with lower neuronal spiking activity compared to controls in the BLA of sham-lesioned rats, but was unchanged from controls in hemiparkinsonian rats. Yohimbine did not affect ACC neuronal spiking activity in either group. Overall, the lack of ACC responsiveness to diazepam in hemiparkinsonian, but not sham-lesioned rats underscores a plausible fundamental difference in anxiety-related neural signaling between animal groups.",

In this work, we developed a novel PEEK tube-based solid-phase microextraction (SPME)-HPLC method for analysis of yohimbine in plasma and further for pharmacokinetic study. Poly (AA-EGDMA) was synthesized inside a PEEK tube as the sorbent for microextraction of yohimbine, and parameters that could influence extraction efficiency were systematically investigated. Under optimum conditions, the PEEK tube-based SPME method exhibits excellent enrichment efficiency towards yohimbine. By using berberine as internal standard, an online SPME-HPLC method was developed for analysis of yohimbine in human plasma sample. The method has wide linear range (2-1000 ng/mL) with an R2 of 0.9962; the limit of detection was determined and was as low as 0.1 ng/mL using UV detection. Finally, a pharmacokinetic study of yohimbine was carried out by the online SPME-HPLC method and the results have been compared with those of reported methods.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 adult, reproductively mature female rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were divided into five groups (n = 10/group). In the control group PCOS was not induced (negative control group), whereas in the remaining four groups (n = 40) PCOS was induced with a single i.m. injection of testosterone daily and were designated as follows: positive control, naloxone-treated (NalT), yohimbine-treated (YohT), and naloxone+yohimbine-treated (NalYT) groups. RESULTS: A steadily ascending trend was noted in all of the studied parameters in the PCOS-induced group as compared to the negative control group. All the parameters showed a descending trend in the NalT group as compared to the positive control. Regarding the YohT and NalYT groups, all parameters showed a descending trend as compared to the positive control group except for estradiol. CONCLUSION: Naloxone therapy either alone or combined with yohimbine improves a wide range of the clinical manifestations of PCOS. Furthermore, we suggest this therapy as an alternative to the conventional therapy with insulin-lowering agents in vogue.",

      "abstract": "Infiltration of activated neutrophils into the vital organs contributes to the multiple organ dysfunctions in sepsis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of berberine in combination with yohimbine (BY) on neutrophil tissue infiltration and multiple organ damage during sepsis, and further elucidated the involved mechanisms. Sepsis was induced in mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). BY or CCR2 antagonist was administered 2h after CLP, and anti-IL-10 antibody (IL-10 Ab) or control IgG was injected intraperitoneally just before BY treatment. We found that IL-10 production was enhanced by BY therapy in septic mice. BY significantly attenuated neutrophil tissue infiltration and multiple organ injury in CLP-challenged mice, all of which were completely reversed by IL-10 Ab pretreatment. The levels of KC, MCP-1, MIP-1α and MIP-2 in the lung, liver and kidney were markedly increased 6h after CLP. BY reduced the tissue concentrations of these chemokines in septic mice, but IL-10 Ab pretreatment did not completely eliminate these inhibitory effects of BY. Particularly, dramatically increased CCR2 expression in circulating neutrophils of septic mice was reduced by BY and this effect was completely abolished by IL-10 Ab pretreatment. Furthermore, CCR2 antagonist also inhibited lung and renal injury and neutrophil infiltration in septic mice. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that BY therapy attenuates neutrophil tissue infiltration and multiple organ injury in septic mice, at least in part, via IL-10-mediated inhibition of CCR2 expression in circulating neutrophils.",

      "abstract": "Excitation of renal sympathetic nervous activity and the resulting increased levels of renal venous norepinephrine play important roles in renal ischaemia/reperfusion injury in rats. This study examined the effects of yohimbine, a non-selective α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, on renal venous norepinephrine levels and kidney function in acute kidney injury. Acute ischaemia/reperfusion-induced kidney injury was induced in rats by clamping the left renal artery and vein for 45min, followed by reperfusion, 2 weeks after a contralateral nephrectomy. Intravenous injection of yohimbine (0.1mg/kg) 5min prior to ischaemia significantly attenuated kidney injury and decreased the renal venous norepinephrine levels, as compared with vehicle-treated rats. To investigate the involvement of α2-adrenoceptor subtypes, we pre-treated with JP-1302, a selective α2C-adrenoceptor antagonist (1mg/kg). This suppressed renal venous norepinephrine levels and tumour necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA levels after reperfusion and improved kidney function. Pre-treatment with BRL44408, a selective α2A-adrenoceptor antagonist (1mg/kg), or imiloxan, a selective α2B-adrenoceptor antagonist (1mg/kg) had no effect on renal function or tissue injury. These results suggest that yohimbine prevented ischaemia/reperfusion-induced kidney injury by inhibiting α2C-adrenoceptors and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common type of chronic inflammatory disease which is triggered by dysfunction in the immune system which in turn affects synovial joints. Current treatment of RA with NSAIDs and DMRDs is limited by their side effect. As a result, the interest in alternative, well tolerated anti-inflammatory remedies has re-emerged. Our aim was to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities underlying the anti-RA effect of Yohimbine hydrochloride (YCL) in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in Wistar rats. The YCL was administered at doses of 5 and 10 mg kg-1 body weight once daily for 28 days. The effects of treatment in the rats were assessed by biochemical parameter (articular elastase, LPO, GSH, catalase, SOD), hematological parameter (ESR, WBC, C-reactive protein (CRP), immunohistochemical expression (COX2, TNF-α, and NF-κB), and histological changes in joints. YCL showed anti-RA efficacy as it significantly reduced articular elastase, LPO and catalase level and ameliorates histological changes. This is in addition to its antioxidant efficacy as YCL shown a significant increase in GSH and SOD level. Also, YCL showed effective anti-inflammatory activity as it significantly decreased the expression of COX-2, TNF-α, and NF-ĸB. The therapeutic effect of YCL against RA was also evident from lower arthritis scoring and reduced hematological parameter (ESR, WBC, and C-reactive protein level). The abilities to inhibit proinflammatory cytokines and modulation of antioxidant states that the protective effect of YCL on arthritis rats might be mediated via the modulation of the immune system. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists, such as prazosin, show promise in treating alcoholism. In rats, prazosin reduces alcohol self-administration and relapse induced by footshock stress and the alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine, but the processes involved in these effects of prazosin are not known. Here, we present studies on the central mechanisms underlying the effects of prazosin on yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. METHODS: In experiment 1, we trained rats to self-administer alcohol (12 % w/v, 1 h/day), extinguished their responding, and tested the effects of prazosin, administered ICV (2 and 6 nmol) or systemically (1 mg/kg) on yohimbine (1.25 mg/kg)-induced reinstatement. In experiment 2, we determined potential central sites of action by analyzing effects of prazosin (1 mg/kg) on yohimbine (1.25 mg/kg)-induced Fos expression. In experiment 3, we determined the effects of doxazosin (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg), an alpha-1 antagonist with a longer half-life on yohimbine-induced reinstatement. RESULTS: Yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking was reduced significantly by ICV and systemic prazosin (50 and 69 % decreases, respectively). Systemic prazosin reduced yohimbine-induced Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex, accumbens shell, ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and basolateral amygdala (46-67 % decreases). Doxazosin reduced yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking (78 % decrease). CONCLUSIONS: Prazosin acts centrally to reduce yohimbine-induced alcohol seeking. The Fos mapping study suggests candidate sites where it may act. Doxazosin is also effective in reducing yohimbine-induced reinstatement. These data provide information on the mechanisms of alpha-1 antagonists on yohimbine-induced alcohol seeking and indicate their further investigation for the treatment of alcoholism.",

Data from previous studies suggest that relapse may be triggered by stress and drug-paired cues and that there are significant sex differences in the magnitude of these responses. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the pharmacological stressor and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine and cocaine cues on executive function in cocaine-dependent men and women. METHODS: In a double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study, cocaine-dependent men (n=12), cocaine-dependent women (n=27), control men (n=31) and control women (n=25) received either yohimbine or placebo prior to two cocaine cue exposure sessions. Participants performed the Connors' Continuous Performance Test II prior to medication/placebo administration and immediately after each cue exposure session RESULTS: Healthy controls had a significant increase in commission errors under the yohimbine condition [RR (95% CI)=1.1 (1.0-1.3), χ(2)1=2.0, p=0.050]. Cocaine-dependent individuals exhibited a significant decrease in omission errors under the yohimbine condition [RR (95% CI)=0.6 (0.4-0.8), χ(2)1=8.6, p=0.003]. Cocaine-dependent women had more omission errors as compared to cocaine-dependent men regardless of treatment [RR (95% CI)=7.2 (3.6-14.7), χ(2)1=30.1, p<0.001]. Cocaine-dependent women exhibited a slower hit reaction time as compared to cocaine-dependent men [Female 354 ± 13 vs. Male 415 ± 14; t89=2.6, p=0.012].

Fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) treatment in rats reduced the immobility time, and pretreatment with yohimbine significantly enhanced the antidepressant-like behavior of fluoxetine at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg. Similarly, Sanggenon G significantly decreased the immobility time, reducing immobility by a maximum of 43.9 % when treated at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Furthermore, pretreatment with yohimbine significantly enhanced the antidepressant-like behavior of Sanggenon G at 5 and 10 mg/kg. Our findings suggest that the antidepressant-like effect of Sanggenon G could be facilitated by concomitant use of the α2-antagonist. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential of Sanggenon G as an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of depression.",

      "abstract": "The search for drugs with anorectic activity, acting within the adrenergic system has attracted the interest of researchers. Partial α2-adrenoceptor agonists might offer the potential for effective and safe treatment of obesity. We compared the effectiveness and safety of α2-adrenoceptor ligands in reducing body mass. We also analyzed if antagonist and partial agonists of α2-adrenoceptor--yohimbine and guanfacine--act similarly, and determined which course of action is connected with anorectic activity. We tested intrinsic activity and effect on the lipolysis of these compounds in cell cultures, evaluated their effect on meal size, body weight in Wistar rats with high-fat diet-induced obesity, and determined their effect on blood pressure, heart rate, lipid profile, spontaneous locomotor activity, core temperature and glucose, as well as glycerol and cortisol levels. Both guanfacine and yohimbine showed anorectic activity. Guanfacine was much more effective than yohimbine. Both significantly reduced the amount of intraperitoneal adipose tissue and had a beneficial effect on lipid profiles. Decreased response of α2A-adrenoceptors and partial stimulation of α2B-receptors seem to be responsible for the anorectic action of guanfacine. The stimulation of α1-adrenoceptors by guanfacine is responsible for cardiovascular side effects but may also be linked with improved anorexic effect. α1-adrenoceptor blockade is connected with the side effects of yohimbine, but it is also associated with the improvement of lipid profiles. Guanfacine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hypertension and conduct disorder, but as it reduces body weight, it is worth examining its effectiveness and safety in models of obesity.",

Previous studies with the schedule-induced polydipsia paradigm (a putative preclinical anxiety model) have shown that repeated administration of antidepressant drugs is necessary to produce a suppression of polydipsia, which is interpreted as an anxiolytic-like effect. The present study sought to expand past findings by evaluating the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine and the 5-HT-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine in the schedule-induced polydipsia paradigm with rats. Dose combinations of the α2 adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine with fluoxetine were also explored to determine whether α2 adrenoceptor antagonism could enhance the anxiolytic-like effects produced by an SSRI. Fluoxetine and duloxetine significantly reduced water intake over the course of daily administrations. Daily treatment with the combination of fluoxetine and yohimbine produced a significantly greater reduction in water intake than fluoxetine alone. The present results confirmed previous findings that inhibition of 5-HT reuptake reduces water consumption in this paradigm. The results for the α2 antagonist yohimbine (in combination with fluoxetine) also indicate that α2 adrenoceptor antagonism may significantly enhance anxiolytic-like effects of SSRIs.",

Co-administration of the α2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine hastens the behavioral and neurogenic effects of the antidepressant imipramine. We examined the transcriptional targets of short duration (7days), combination treatment of yohimbine and imipramine (Y+I) within the adult rat hippocampus. Using microarray and qPCR analysis we observed functional enrichment of genes involved in intracellular signaling cascades, plasma membrane, cellular metal ion homeostasis, multicellular stress responses and neuropeptide signaling pathways in the Y+I transcriptome. We noted reduced expression of the α2A-adrenoceptor (Adra2a), serotonin 5HT2C receptor (Htr2c) and the somatostatin receptor 1 (Sstr1), which modulate antidepressant action. Further, we noted a regulation of signaling pathway genes like inositol monophosphatase 2 (Impa2), iodothyronine deiodinase 3 (Dio3), regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (Rgs4), alkaline ceramidase 2 (Acer2), doublecortin-like kinase 2 (Dclk2), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (Nfkbia) and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (Sgk1), several of which are implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Comparative analysis revealed an overlap in the hippocampal regulation of Acer2, Nfkbia, Sgk1 and Impa2 between Y+I treatment, the fast-acting electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) paradigm, and the slow-onset chronic (21days) imipramine treatment. Further, Y+I treatment enhanced the quiescent neural progenitor pool in the hippocampal neurogenic niche similar to ECS, and distinct from chronic imipramine treatment. Taken together, our results provide insight into the molecular and cellular targets of short duration Y+I treatment, and identify potential leads for the development of rapid-action antidepressants.",

Few studies were conducted on zebrafish, a newly emerged vertebrate model organism. Zebrafish larvae are particularly suitable for high-throughput screening of drug effects. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of yohimbine on the anxiety-related behaviors of zebrafish larvae. METHODS: AB strain zebrafish larvae at both 5 and 7 days postfertilization (dpf) were treated with different concentrations of yohimbine. General locomotor activities and thigmotaxis behavior were analyzed under continuous illumination, which represented normal condition, or under alternating light-dark challenges, which represented stressful environment. RESULTS: Under continuous illumination, the 5-dpf larvae demonstrated increased swimming distances at low yohimbine concentrations, whereas the 7-dpf larvae demonstrated progressively decreased swimming distances with increases in yohimbine concentration. Low concentrations of yohimbine reduced thigmotaxis of the larvae, while high concentrations of yohimbine increased it. During the dark period of the light-dark challenge phase, low concentrations of yohimbine increased swimming distances of the larvae at both 5 and 7 dpf, while high concentrations of yohimbine decreased it. Yohimbine induced increased thigmotaxis in both 5- and 7-dpf larvae during the dark period. CONCLUSIONS: Under normal condition (lights on), low doses of yohimbine were anxiolytic in both the 5- and 7-dpf larvae, whereas high doses of yohimbine were anxiogenic only in the 7-dpf larvae. Under mildly stressful condition (lights off), yohimbine treatment demonstrated dose-dependent effects to potentiate anxiety-related behaviors in both the 5- and 7-dpf larvae, although the significant dose varied with age.",

These findings have not been characterized in clinical populations. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine the impact a pharmacological stressor, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine, on the subjective, endocrine, and physiologic responses to drug-paired cues cocaine-dependent men and women. METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study, cocaine-dependent men (n = 32), cocaine-dependent women (n = 30), control men (n = 32), and control women (n = 25) received either yohimbine or placebo prior to two cocaine cue exposure sessions. RESULTS: Yohimbine increased ratings of anxiety both before (p < 0.001) and after (p = 0.035) cues, and the post-cue increase in anxiety was more pronounced in women (p = 0.001). Yohimbine also significantly increased craving, compared with placebo (p < 0.05), following the cue presentation, and this effect was greater in women than men (gender by treatment interaction; p = 0.006). Yohimbine also increased salivary cortisol (p < 0.001) and dehydroepiandrosterone (p = 0.003) levels, regardless of diagnostic group. Women had a significantly greater heart rate response following yohimbine as compared with men (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Stress may increase the salience of cocaine cues for cocaine-dependent women as compared with men. This suggests gender differences in vulnerability to craving and relapse under stressful conditions.",

Alcohol-cue associations may be strengthened by enhancing adrenergic activity with yohimbine or weakened by blocking adrenergic activity with propranolol. Alcohol-cue associations may also be weakened by long cue exposure sessions or strengthened by short cue exposure sessions. A useful treatment approach for alcoholism may combine adrenergic manipulation with cue exposure sessions of a specific duration. The present study sought to determine if cue exposure during long- or short-duration extinction sessions with post-session yohimbine or propranolol would alter alcohol cue-induced responding and self-administration. Rats were trained to respond for alcohol during sessions that included an olfactory cue given at the beginning of the session and a visual/auditory cue complex delivered concurrently with alcohol. Cue-induced responding was assessed before and after the repeated extinction sessions. Repeated alcohol extinction sessions of long duration (45 min) or short duration (5 min) were followed immediately by injections of saline, yohimbine, or propranolol. After the second set of cue-induced responding tests, reacquisition of operant alcohol self-administration was examined. To determine if the experimental procedures were sensitive to memory manipulation through other pharmacological mechanisms, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 was given 20 min prior to long-duration extinction sessions. Both the long- and short-duration extinction sessions decreased cue-induced responding. Neither yohimbine nor propranolol, given post-session, had subsequent effects on cue-induced responding or alcohol self-administration. MK-801 blocked the effect of extinction sessions on cue-induced responding but had no effect on self-administration. The present study shows that manipulation of the NMDA system in combination with alcohol cue exposure therapy during extinction-like sessions may be more effective than manipulation of the adrenergic system in reducing the strength of alcohol-cue associations in this specific model of alcohol relapse.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical trials suggest that yohimbine may augment extinction learning without significant side effects. However, previous clinical trials have only examined adults with specific phobias. Yohimbine has not yet been investigated in the augmentation of exposure therapy for other anxiety disorders. METHODS: Adults (n = 40) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of social anxiety disorder were randomized to placebo or yohimbine HCl (10.8 mg) 1 hour before each of four exposure sessions. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, each treatment session, posttreatment, and 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Yohimbine was well tolerated. Yohimbine augmentation, relative to placebo augmentation, resulted in faster improvement and better outcomes on self-report measures of social anxiety disorder severity (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, d = .53) and depressed mood severity (Beck Depression Inventory, d = .37) but not on the clinician-rated measures (Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale, d = .09; Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale, d = .25). Between-group differences on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale were moderated by the level of fear reported at the end of an exposure exercise (end fear), such that the advantage of yohimbine over placebo was only evident among patients who reported low end fear. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide moderate support for yohimbine as a therapeutic augmentation strategy for exposure therapy in social anxiety disorder, one that may be especially effective when coupled with successful exposure experiences. Beneficial effects for yohimbine were readily evident for self-report measures but not for clinician-rated outcomes of social anxiety severity and improvement.",

However, considering high rates of PTSD in the present veteran population, ongoing research work is important toward improving treatment efficiency by decreasing time to symptom amelioration and increasing the amount of symptom amelioration. The proposed research aims to enhance exposure therapy outcomes for veterans with PTSD via combination treatment with PE and yohimbine hydrochloride (HCL), an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist. The proposed investigation entails a randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of a single administration of yohimbine HCL (paired with the first session of imaginal exposure) on outcome of PE in 40 veterans with PTSD. An additional goal is to establish a pragmatic method of tracking psychophysiological measures over the course of therapy for incorporation into future clinical psychotherapy trials. Thus, in addition to traditional self- and clinician-reported psychological outcomes, heart rate and skin conductance reactivity will be measured during a standard trauma-specific imagery task before, during, and after PE treatment. We will further investigate whether changes in psychophysiological measures predict changes in patient- and clinician-reported outcome measures.",

      "abstract": "The neurobiological underpinnings of anxiety are of paramount importance to selective and efficacious pharmaceutical intervention. Hippocampal theta frequency in urethane anaesthetized rats is suppressed by all known (and some previously unknown) anti-anxiety (anxiolytic) drugs. Although these findings support the predictive validity of this assay, its construct validity (i.e., whether theta frequency actually indexes anxiety per se) has not been a subject of systematic investigation. We reasoned that if anxiolytic drugs suppress hippocampal theta frequency, then drugs that increase anxiety (i.e., anxiogenic agents) should increase theta frequency, thus providing evidence of construct validity. We used three proven anxiogenic drugs--two benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists, N-methyl-β-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG7142) and β-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester (βCCE), and one α2 noradrenergic receptor antagonist, 17α-hydroxy-yohimban-16α-carboxylic acid methyl ester (yohimbine) as pharmacological probes to assess the construct validity of the theta model. Although all three anxiogenic drugs significantly increased behavioural measures of anxiety in the elevated plus-maze, none of the three increased the frequency of hippocampal theta oscillations in the neurophysiological model. As a positive control, we demonstrated that diazepam, a proven anxiolytic drug, decreased the frequency of hippocampal theta, as in all other studies using this model. Given this discrepancy between the significant effects of anxiogenic drugs in the behavioural model and the null effects of these drugs in the neurophysiological model, we conclude that the construct validity of the hippocampal theta model of anxiety is questionable.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Yohimbine is an indole alkaloid used as a promising therapy for erectile dysfunction. A number of methods were reported for the analysis of yohimbine in the bark or in pharmaceutical preparations. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In the present work, a simple and sensitive high performance thin layer chromatographic method is developed for determination of yohimbine (occurring as yohimbine hydrochloride) in pharmaceutical preparations and validated according to International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. The method employed thin layer chromatography aluminum sheets precoated with silica gel as the stationary phase and the mobile phase consisted of chloroform:methanol:ammonia (97:3:0.2), which gave compact bands of yohimbine hydrochloride. RESULTS: Linear regression data for the calibration curves of standard yohimbine hydrochloride showed a good linear relationship over a concentration range of 80-1000 ng/spot with respect to the area and correlation coefficient (R(2)) was 0.9965. The method was evaluated regarding accuracy, precision, selectivity, and robustness. Limits of detection and quantitation were recorded as 5 and 40 ng/spot, respectively. The proposed method efficiently separated yohimbine hydrochloride from other components even in complex mixture containing powdered plants. The amount of yohimbine hydrochloride ranged from 2.3 to 5.2 mg/tablet or capsule in preparations containing the pure alkaloid, while it varied from zero (0) to 1.5-1.8 mg/capsule in dietary supplements containing powdered yohimbe bark. CONCLUSION: We concluded that this method employing high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) in quantitative determination of yohimbine hydrochloride in pharmaceutical preparations is efficient, simple, accurate, and validated."

      "abstract": "In this study the effects of yohimbine and sildenafil on cold stress-induced erectile dysfunction in rats were investigated. Yohimbine hydrochloride (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) and sildenafil citrate (20 mg/kg, i.p) were administered to rats 1h before the stress session daily for 14 consecutive days and their effect was assessed. Results of this section revealed that, immersion of rats in cold water significantly decreased sexual arousal and motivation as indicated by increased latencies and intervals. Furthermore decreased copulatory performance and potency as indicated by decreased ejaculation frequency was observed. Decreased copulatory activity was confirmed by decreased testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating-hormone (FSH) levels as well as decreased cholesterol content in rat testes. Treatment with yohimbine or sildenafil significantly increased the sexual arousal and potency and corrected the effects induced by stress on the mating behavior of male rats. On the contrary they did not significantly alter testosterone, FSH and LH levels which is reflected by failure of both drugs to alter cholesterol content in rat testes. Regarding the effect of yohimbine and sildenafil on isolated rat corpus cavernosum, their cumulative dose response curves (3×10(-7), 3×10(-6) and 3×10(-5) M) were determined in corpus cavernosum strips isolated from normal rats and pre-contracted with phenylephrine (3×10(-6) M) were also assessed. Results of this part showed that both yohimbine and sildenafil have a relaxant effect on rat corpus cavernosum strips in a dose dependant manner, which is confirmed by the increase in nitric oxide content in rats' penis shown by sildenafil.",

      "abstract": "Brimonidine, an alpha2-adrenergic receptor (α(2)-AR) agonist, is thought to be neuroprotective in some types of neurons via the activation of α(2)-AR. However, it is still unknown whether the α(2)-ARs exist in cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The authors aimed to demonstrate the presence and localization of α(2)-ARs in rat-cultured SGNs and to investigate the effect of brimonidine on glutamate- and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced damage in the primary-cultured rat SGNs. The expression of α(2)-ARs was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Then SGNs were exposed to glutamate or H(2)O(2) respectively with or without brimonidine. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Apoptosis was determined by acridine orange and Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide double staining. The protein expressions of α(2)-ARs, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, p-ERK1/2, iNOS, and artemin were determined by Western blot respectively. The cell viability was markedly reduced after exposure of glutamate (1mM) or H(2)O(2) (300 μM) to SGNs. Treatment with brimonidine protected SGNs against glutamate- or H(2)O(2)-induced cell damage, enhanced SGNs survival, decreased the elevation of Bax, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, p-ERK1/2, and artemin triggered by glutamate or H(2)O(2), and altered the expressions of Bcl-2 and iNOS. These protective effects of brimonidine can be reversed by yohimbine. Overall, the study describes the localization of α(2)-ARs in rat-cultured SGNs and indicates that brimonidine, which may work directly via interaction with α(2)-ARs, attenuates glutamate- and H(2)O(2)-induced damage in SGNs by Caspase-dependent modes as well as Caspase-independent modes.",

Yohimbine affected neither of these values in WF rats, but decreased blood glucose and increased serum insulin concentrations in GK rats. Total pancreatic and islet blood flows, measured with microspheres, were increased in GK when compared to WF rats. Yohimbine affected none of the blood flow values in WF rats, whereas islet blood flow in GK rats was reduced to values similar to those seen in WF rats.

The present study assessed whether these drugs can overcome the suppressive effects of short winter-like day lengths on MSB. Yohimbine treatments that markedly increase copulatory behavior of male hamsters in long days were completely ineffective in facilitating MSB when injected after gonadal regression induced by 16 wks of short day lengths and after complete gonadal recrudescence after 32 wks of short days; apomorphine was similarly ineffective. The brain circuit that mediates MSB either may be less responsive to yohimbine and apomorphine in short than long days, or these drugs may not produce equivalent neurotransmitter changes in the two day lengths. After 32 wks of short-day treatment, all males had undergone testicular recrudescence and successfully ejaculated on initial tests with sexually receptive females after a hiatus of at least 4 mo during which they were denied mating opportunities. This suggests that overwintering males in the field are in a state of reproductive readiness at the outset of spring conditions favorable for survival of offspring.",

ANIMALS: Nine healthy adult horses aged 9 ± 4 years and weighing of 561 ± 56 kg. METHODS: Three dose regimens were employed in the current study. 1) 0.03 mg kg(-1) detomidine IV (D), 2) 0.2 mg kg(-1) yohimbine IV (Y) and 3) 0.03 mg kg(-1) detomidine IV followed 15 minutes later by 0.2 mg kg(-1) yohimbine IV (DY). Each horse received all three dose regimens with a minimum of 1 week in between subsequent regimens. Blood samples were obtained and plasma analyzed for detomidine and yohimbine concentrations by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using both non-compartmental and compartmental analysis. RESULTS: The maximum measured detomidine concentrations were 76.0 and 129.9 ng mL(-1) for the D and DY treatments, respectively. Systemic clearance and volume of distribution of detomidine were not significantly different for either treatment. There was a significant increase in the maximum measured yohimbine plasma concentrations from Y (173.9 ng mL(-1)) to DY (289.8 ng mL(-1)). Both the Cl and V(d) for yohimbine were significantly less (6.8 mL minute(-1) kg(-1) (Cl) and 1.7 L kg(-1) (V(d) )) for the DY as compared to the Y treatments (13.9 mL minute(-1) kg(-1) (Cl) and 2.7 L kg(-1) (V(d))). Plasma concentrations were below the limit of quantitation (0.05 and 0.5 ng mL(-1)) by 18 hours for both detomidine and yohimbine. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The Cl and V(d) of yohimbine were affected by prior administration of detomidine. The elimination half life of yohimbine remained unaffected when administered subsequent to detomidine. However, the increased plasma concentrations in the presence of detomidine has the potential to cause untoward effects and therefore further studies to assess the physiologic effects of this combination of drugs are warranted.",

It is thought that the mechanism of enhanced emotional memory is stimulated through elevated noradrenaline levels. This randomized placebo-controlled trial examined the potential exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in a clinical sample of participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for a specific phobia (fear of flying). METHODS: Sixty-seven participants with fear of flying were randomized to 4 sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) combined with YOH (10 mg), or 4 sessions of VRET combined with a placebo. Treatment consisted of 4 weekly 1-hour exposure sessions consisting of two 25-minute virtual flights. At pre- and post- treatment, fear of flying was assessed. The YOH or placebo capsules were administered 1 h prior to exposures. The manipulation of the noradrenaline activity was confirmed by salivary α-amylase (sAA) samples taken pre-, during and post-exposure. RESULTS: Forty-eight participants completed treatment. Manipulation of noradrenaline levels with YOH was successful, with significantly higher levels of sAA in the YOH group when entering exposure. Results showed that both groups improved significantly from pre- to post-treatment with respect to anxiety reduction. However, although the manipulation of noradrenaline activity was successful, there was no evidence that YOH enhanced outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Participants improved significantly on anxiety measures independently of drug condition, after 4 sessions of VRET. These data do not support the initial findings of exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in this dosage in clinical populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alpha 2A adrenergic receptor (AR) is a subtype of α2 AR belonging to G protein-coupled receptors, and exerts a variety of biological effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that the α2A AR activation was closely related with inflammatory reaction. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of α2A AR antagonist, yohimbine, on the severity of endotoxin-induced acute lung injury in rats. METHODS: A total of 72 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group and LPS + yohimbine group. Rats were intratracheally administrated with normal saline or LPS (300 µg), and the rats in the LPS + yohimbine group were treated with additional yohimbine (2 mg/kg, i.p) soon after LPS administration. Six, 24 and 48 hours after treatment, arterial blood gas analysis was carried out, and optical microscopy was performed to evaluate pathological changes in the lung, and lung injury score was assessed. The count of white blood cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was determined. The levels of norepinephrine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 in BALF were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunocytochemistry was performed for the detection of α2A AR on inflammatory cells in BALF. RESULTS: When compared with the control group, the oxygenation index in the LPS group was significantly decreased, and white blood cell count, the lung histopathological scores, levels of norepinephrine and IL-6 as well as α2A AR expression on inflammatory cells in the BALF were dramatically increased at different time points, and the concentrations of TNF-α and IL-1β were also increased except at 48 hours after LPS administration. The oxygenation index decreased while white blood cell count in BALF and the lung histopathological scores were obviously increased in the LPS + yohimbine group. The level of norepinephrine in BALF was increased at each time interval in the LPS + yohimbine group, and so did the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 at 6 and 48 hours after LPS administration respectively. When compared with the LPS group, the oxygenation index, white blood cell count, the lung histopathological scores and the level of IL-6 in the LPS + yohimbine group were significantly improved at each time interval, and the concentrations of TNF-α and IL-1β were also lower at 24 hours of LPS administration (all P < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated the level of norepinephrine was related to the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in the BALF and the lung histopathological scores (r = 0.703, r = 0.595, r = 0.487 and r = 0.688, respectively, P < 0.001) and the intensity scores of immunoreactivity to α2A AR on inflammatory cells were also associated with the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 as well as the lung histopathologial scores (r = 0.803, r = 0.978, r = 0.716 and r = 0.808, respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Yohimbine can inhibit TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 overproduction and relieve the severity of pulmonary inflammation induced by endotoxin, which is maybe mediated by blockade of α2A AR on inflammatory cells.",

      "abstract": "A major problem in treating alcohol use disorders (AUDs) is the high rate of relapse due to stress and re-exposure to cues or an environment previously associated with alcohol use. Stressors can induce relapse to alcohol-seeking in humans or reinstatement in rodents. Delta opioid peptide receptors (DOP-Rs) play a role in cue-induced reinstatement of ethanol-seeking; however, their role in stress-induced reinstatement of ethanol-seeking is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the role of DOP-Rs in yohimbine-stress-induced reinstatement of ethanol-seeking. Male, Long-Evans rats were trained to self-administer 10% ethanol in daily 30-minute operant self-administration sessions using a FR3 schedule of reinforcement, followed by extinction training. Once extinction criteria were met, we examined the effects of the DOP-R antagonist, SoRI-9409 (0-5 mg/kg, i.p.) on yohimbine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) stress-induced reinstatement. Additionally, DOP-R-stimulated [(35) S]GTPγS binding was measured in brain membranes and plasma levels of corticosterone (CORT) were determined. Pre-treatment with SoRI-9409 decreased yohimbine stress-induced reinstatement of ethanol-seeking but did not affect yohimbine-induced increases in plasma CORT levels. Additionally, yohimbine increased DOP-R-stimulated (35) [S]GTPγS binding in brain membranes of ethanol-trained rats, an effect that was inhibited by SoRI-9409. This suggests that the DOP-R plays an important role in yohimbine-stress-induced reinstatement of ethanol-seeking behavior, and DOP-R antagonists may be promising candidates for further development as a treatment for AUDs.",

      "abstract": "Orthostatic hypotension affects patients with autonomic failure producing considerable disability because of presyncopal symptoms. Severely affected patients may have residual sympathetic tone that can be engaged to increase blood pressure (BP) with the α-2 adrenergic antagonist yohimbine. This medication activates sympathetic outflow centrally and unrestrains norepinephrine release from noradrenergic neurons. Alternatively, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, pyridostigmine, can increase sympathetic tone by improving ganglionic cholinergic neurotransmission. Our purpose was to compare these complementary approaches and to explore whether the combination would lead to synergistic increases in BP. We compared the effects of 60 mg of pyridostigmine and 5.4 mg of yohimbine in a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion. In a subset of patients we tested the combination of pyridostigmine and yohimbine. Our primary outcome was the change in standing diastolic BP 60 minutes after drug administration from baseline. We studied a total of 31 patients with severe autonomic failure. Yohimbine significantly improved standing diastolic BP as compared with placebo (11±3 mm Hg [95% CI: 6 to 16 mm Hg]; P<0.001). On the contrary, pyridostigmine did not increase the standing diastolic BP (0.6±3 mm Hg [95% CI: -5 to 5 mm Hg]; P=0.823). Only yohimbine showed a significant improvement in presyncopal symptoms. Sixteen patients received the combination of pyridostigmine and yohimbine, but no evidence of synergistic pressor effect was found. Engaging residual sympathetic tone with yohimbine is a more effective approach to improve orthostatic hypotension as compared with pyridostigmine in patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.",

METHODS: This trial was a 4-week, double blind study of parallel groups of patients with mild to moderate ED. Forty married male patients with ED of mild-to-moderate severity were screened for the study entry;among them, those aged 25-50 who reported a minimum of a- 3-month history of ED were eligible to enroll in this study. The severity of ED was based on EF domain scores on the international index of erectile function (IIEF). The scores of 15-25 was considered as mild to moderate ED. Patients were randomized to receive one capsule of SX or placebo on demand in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated code. RESULTS: The difference between the two groups was significant at week 4 (endpoint) (P=0.03). Four adverse events were observed over the study. The difference between the SX and placebo was not significant in the frequency of adverse events. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that SX is safe and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate ED at least in the short-term."

Here, we examined whether neuropeptide Y (NPY), an endogenous anti-stress mediator, blocks reinstatement of alcohol-seeking induced by the pharmacological stressor yohimbine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NPY [5.0 or 10.0 mug/rat, intracerebroventricularly (ICV)] dose-dependently blocked the reinstatement of alcohol seeking induced by yohimbine (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) but failed to significantly suppress the maintenance of alcohol self-administration. We then used c-fos expression mapping to examine neuronal activation following treatment with yohimbine or NPY alone or yohimbine following NPY pre-treatment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The analysis was focused on a network of structures previously implicated in yohimbine-induced reinstatement, comprised of central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) amygdala and the shell of the nucleus accumbens (Nc AccS). Within this network, both yohimbine and NPY potently induced neuronal activation, and their effects were additive, presumably indicating activation of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that NPY selectively suppresses relapse to alcohol seeking induced by stressful events and support the NPY system as an attractive target for the treatment of alcohol addiction.",

      "abstract": "Sex differences exist in several aspects of cocaine abuse, and recent research suggests that this may be due, in part, to differential sensitivity to stress. Women, compared to men, exhibit greater stress-induced cocaine craving and responses to both cocaine and stress fluctuate during phases of the hormonal cycle. The goal of the present study was to compare male and female rats on the maintenance and extinction of cocaine seeking and on an animal model of stress-induced relapse by administering the pharmacological stressor yohimbine. An additional goal was to examine possible sex-specific treatment effects of the progesterone metabolite, allopregnanolone, on yohimbine-induced reinstatement. Male and female rats were trained to lever press for i.v. infusions of cocaine (0.4 mg/kg). Following a 14-day maintenance period, cocaine solutions were replaced with saline, and rats were allowed to extinguish lever pressing. Subsequently, rats were administered saline, yohimbine (2.5mg/kg), or allopregnanolone (15 mg/kg)+yohimbine (2.5mg/kg) priming injections on separate days using a within-subjects reinstatement procedure. The results indicated that females were more resistant to extinction than male rats and that both groups reinstated cocaine seeking following injections of yohimbine; however, female rats responded more than males to yohimbine-priming injections. Additionally, allopregnanolone blocked yohimbine's potentiating effect on responding in females but not males. These results suggest that females may be more sensitive than males to stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, and the progesterone metabolite, allopregnanolone, offers protection against this vulnerability.",

Although the role of these two critical factors in relapse has been extensively studied, the interaction between stress and drug-associated cues in relapse has been less well characterized. Using an animal model of relapse, we assessed the effects of the pharmacological stressor, yohimbine (1.25 or 2.5mg/kg), on reinstatement of extinguished heroin-seeking in rats either in the presence or absence of heroin-associated cues. Yohimbine, in the absence of heroin-associated cues, and cues by themselves reliably reinstated heroin-seeking over extinction levels. Notably, animals showed significantly potentiated responding when yohimbine preceded cue-induced reinstatement (3-4x higher over cues or yohimbine alone). These results demonstrate that exposure to heroin-paired cues during yohimbine-induced stress greatly potentiates heroin-seeking, and support the simultaneous targeting of both stress and cue activation during relapse intervention.",

Yohimbine is currently approved in the United States for erectile dysfunction and has undergone resurgence in street use as an aphrodisiac and mild hallucinogen. In recent years yohimbine use has become common in body-building communities for its presumed lipolytic and sympathomimetic effects. We describe a 37-year-old bodybuilder in which severe acute neurotoxic effects occurred in 2 h after yohimbine ingestion. The patient presented with malaise, vomiting, loss of consciousness, and repeated seizures after ingestion of 5 g of yohimbine during a body-building competition in a gymnasium. His Glasgow Coma Score was 3, requiring orotracheal intubation. Two hours after admission, vital signs were blood pressure 259/107 mmHg and heart rate 140 beats/min. Treatment with furosemide, labetalol, clonidine, and urapidil and gastrointestinal decontamination were performed. Twelve hours later the patient was extubated with normal hemodynamic parameters and neurological examination. The yohimbine blood levels at 3, 6, 14, and 22 h after ingestion were 5,240; 2,250; 1,530; and 865 ng/mL, respectively, with a mean half-life of 2 h. Few data are available about yohimbine toxicity and the related blood levels. This is a case of a large ingestion of yohimbine in which severe hemodynamic and neurological manifestations occurred and elevated blood levels of yohimbine were detected.",

Five healthy male beagles were assigned to each of the 8 treatment groups in a randomized design at 1-week intervals in the same dog. One group was not medicated. The dogs in the other groups received 2 mg/kg xylazine intramuscularly (IM) and a treatment of saline (control), 50, 100 or 300 microg/kg of each atipamezole or yohimbine IM 0.5 hr later. Urine and blood samples were collected 11 times over the course of 24 hr. Urine volume, pH, specific gravity and creatinine values; osmolality, electrolyte and arginine vasopressin (AVP) values in both urine and plasma; and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration were measured. Both atipamezole and yohimbine antagonized xylazine-induced diuresis. The reversal effect of yohimbine was more potent, but not dose-dependent at the tested doses, in contrast with atipamezole. Both atipamezole and yohimbine exhibited similar potency in reversing the decreases in urine specific gravity, osmolality, creatinine, sodium and chloride concentrations and the increase in the plasma potassium concentration induced by xylazine. Both also inhibited xylazine-induced diuresis without significantly altering the hormonal profile in the dogs. A higher dose of atipamezole tended to increase the plasma ANP concentration. This may not be due only to actions mediated by alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. Both drugs can be used as antagonistic agents against xylazine-induced diuresis in healthy dogs.",

      "abstract": "It has been shown that increased cerebral noradrenergic activity is closely related to anxiety-related behaviours. Furthermore, the noradrenergic alpha-2 receptor antagonist yohimbine (YOH) increases noradrenaline- (NA) cell firing and release in discrete brain areas involved in the modulation of anxiety such as the locus coeruleus (LC) and amygdala (AMY). In addition, YOH is highly anxiogenic in both humans and laboratory animals. Here we used an in vivo dual methodology to measure concomitantly the extracellular levels of catecholamines in AMY with voltammetry and the cell firing rate in LC with field electrophysiology in anaesthetized rats to characterize the pharmacological effects of YOH. We found that systemic administration of YOH increases both noradrenergic cell firing in the LC and catecholamines release in the AMY. Prior administration of the alpha-2 agonist clonidine prevents these effects on both the electrophysiological and the voltammetric signals, suggesting that YOH effects are mainly mediated by the alpha-2 adrenoceptors. In addition, we found that pre-treatment with the behaviourally active doses of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDE, Librium: BDZ very similar to diazepam) and of the non-BDZ buspirone counteract the effects of YOH on catecholamines release and cell firing. This suggests that the neurochemical and physiological effects of YOH measured in this study might be related to the anxiogenic effects of the drug. Thus, the presented electrophysiological-voltammetric-YOH study may be proposed as in vivo real time model of anxiety and this approach might be suitable for the evaluation of the neurochemical and physiological effects of new anxiolytic compounds.",

This study encompasses patients with acute coronary syndrome, who were receiving the dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel. The focus of the study was to gain insight into the role of selective P2Y1 antagonism using MRS2179 in such cases as well as its effects, if any, on collagen-epinephrine interaction. All the cases showed greater potency of inhibition of the interaction when yohimbine hydrochloride (YH), a blocker of alpha2A-adrenoreceptor, was used compared to MRS2179, a P2Y1 antagonist, although there was variability in responsiveness to the antiplatelet drugs. These findings indicate that alpha2A-adrenoreceptors of platelets in this group play a major role in precipitating the interactive effect of collagen and epinephrine. The dose-response effect as studied by platelet aggregometry showed that the required molar concentration to block the interactive effect in the case of YH was less than that of MRS2179. Hence, it is postulated that although there may be an impairment of collagen-induced aggregation by MRS2179, the interactive effect of collagen-epinephrine may not be impaired by MRS2179 as efficaciously as YH.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Psychostimulants, such as yohimbine and amphetamine, can enhance learning and memory. Extinction of conditioned fear involves new learning, so we asked whether psychostimulants could enhance this learning. Previous work suggests that yohimbine facilitates extinction, using freezing as a fear measure. However, psychostimulant-induced alterations in locomotion can confound freezing measurements. Furthermore, the effects of amphetamine on fear extinction have never been examined. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of yohimbine and amphetamine in enhancing fear extinction. In addition to freezing, we measured bar-press suppression, which is less sensitive to changes in locomotion. We asked: Do psychostimulants reduce fear during extinction training when drug is present? Does learning extinction with psychostimulants result in better extinction retention? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats received fear conditioning on day 1 followed by partial extinction training on days 2 and 3. Yohimbine (1.0, 2.0, or 5.0 mg/kg, i.p.), amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), or vehicle were injected prior to extinction on day 2. RESULTS: Yohimbine dose-dependently reduced freezing during extinction training on day 2, whereas bar-press suppression was reduced at the highest dose only. When tested drug-free, yohimbine-treated rats showed equivalent levels of freezing and suppression to controls. Amphetamine also decreased freezing during extinction, but did not decrease suppression. During the drug-free test, there was no difference between amphetamine-treated rats and controls in either measure. CONCLUSIONS: Although yohimbine and amphetamine are capable of decreasing freezing, neither drug strengthened retention of fear extinction. Based on these rodent findings, psychostimulants may not be suitable adjuncts to extinction-based therapies for the treatment of anxiety disorders.",

This randomized placebo controlled study examined the potential exposure enhancing effect of yohimbine hydrochloride in claustrophobic humans. Participants (71% undergraduate students and 29% community volunteers) displaying marked claustrophobic fear (n=24) were treated with 2 1-h in vivo exposure sessions. Participants were randomly allocated to take 10.8mg yohimbine hydrochloride (n=12) or placebo (n=12) prior to each exposure session. Outcome measures included peak fear during a behavioral avoidance task, the Claustrophobia Questionnaire, and the Claustrophobic Concerns Questionnaire. Results showed that both conditions improved significantly at post-treatment with no significant difference between groups. Consistent with prediction the group that took yohimbine hydrochloride prior to exposure sessions showed significantly greater improvement in peak fear at the one-week follow-up behavioral assessment (d=1.68). This was also true across other outcome measures with large to very large effect sizes. These data provide initial support for exposure enhancing effect of single-dose yohimbine hydrochloride in a clinical application.",

The present experiments investigated whether repeated exposure to YOH during extinction training affects the time-course of extinction and the magnitude of subsequent YOH- or footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Rats trained to self-administer cocaine were given five days of extinction training, during which they were injected with YOH (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) either before or after daily extinction sessions. Following additional extinction training in the absence of YOH, animals were tested for reinstatement to a YOH (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) or footshock (20 min, intermittent, 0.9 mA per 0.5 s shock) challenge. Animals injected with YOH before daily extinction sessions showed an attenuated rate of extinction, relative to control animals. Following additional extinction training in the absence of YOH treatment, these same animals showed a marked attenuation of YOH-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. YOH treatment during extinction did not, however, affect the magnitude of reinstatement induced by footshock. These findings demonstrate that repeated exposure to a stressor during extinction training can modulate the processes governing extinction learning and the subsequent reinstatement of drug seeking induced by that stressor.",

      "abstract": "Extinction, a form of learning that has the ability to reshape learned behavior based on new experiences, has been heavily studied utilizing fear learning paradigms. Mechanisms underlying extinction of positive-valence associations, such as drug self-administration and place preference, are poorly understood yet may have important relevance to addiction treatment. Data suggest a major role for the noradrenergic system in extinction of fear-based learning. Employing both pharmacological and genetic approaches, we investigated the role of the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(2)-AR) in extinction of cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP) and glutamatergic transmission in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We found that pre-extinction systemic treatment with the alpha(2)-AR antagonist yohimbine impaired cocaine CPP extinction in C57BL/6J mice, an effect that was not mimicked by the more selective alpha(2)-AR antagonist, atipamezole. Moreover, alpha(2A)-AR knockout mice exhibited similar cocaine CPP extinction and exacerbated extinction impairing effects of yohimbine. Using acute brain slices and electrophysiological approaches, we found that yohimbine produces a slowly evolving depression of glutamatergic transmission in the BNST that was not mimicked by atipamezole. Further, this action was extant in slices from alpha(2A)-AR knockout mice. Our data strongly suggest that extinction-modifying effects of yohimbine are unlikely to be due to actions at alpha(2A)-ARs.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Yohimbine is an alpha-2 adrenoreceptor antagonist that provokes stress- and anxiety-like responses in both humans and laboratory animals. In rats, yohimbine increases operant alcohol self-administration and reinstates alcohol seeking. In this study, we assess whether these effects of yohimbine are attenuated by systemic injections of the corticotrotropin-releasing factor 1 (CRF1) receptor antagonist antalarmin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Exp. 1, we trained rats to lever press for alcohol solutions (12% w/v, 1 h/day) over several weeks; during training, the response requirement was increased from a fixed-ratio-1 (FR-1) to a fixed-ratio-3 (FR-3) reinforcement schedule. We then tested the effect of antalarmin (10 or 20 mg/kg) on yohimbine (1.25 mg/kg)-induced increases in operant alcohol self-administration (FR-3 reinforcement schedule). Subsequently, we assessed the effect of antalarmin on yohimbine-induced increases in plasma corticosterone levels in the previously self-administering rats. In Exp. 2, we trained the rats to self-administer alcohol as in Exp. 1, and after extinction of the alcohol-reinforced lever responding over 13 days, we tested antalarmin's effect on yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. RESULTS: Yohimbine increased operant alcohol self-administration and reinstated alcohol seeking after extinction. These effects of yohimbine were attenuated by antalarmin. Antalarmin injections in the absence of yohimbine had no effect on either operant alcohol self-administration or extinction responding. Antalarmin had no effect on yohimbine-induced corticosterone release in alcohol-experienced rats. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that extrahypothalamic CRF1 receptors are involved in the effect of yohimbine on operant alcohol self-administration and on relapse to alcohol seeking and support the notion that CRF1 receptor antagonists should be considered in alcohol addiction treatment.",

      "abstract": "Previously, we showed that the 5-HT2C receptor agonist Ro60-0175 reduces cocaine self-administration, and the ability of cocaine to reinstate responding after extinction of drug-seeking behavior. The present experiments extended these findings further by determining whether the effects of Ro60-0175 on self-administration were sustained with repeated treatment, and whether Ro60-0175 altered reinstatement induced by the pharmacological stressor yohimbine, or by the context in which self-administration occurred. In Experiment 1, Ro60-0175 (1 mg/kg, s.c.) reduced cocaine (0.25 mg/infusion) self-administration maintained by a progressive ratio schedule. This reduction was sustained over eight daily injections. In Experiment 2, rats self-administered cocaine in daily 2 h sessions for 15 days on a FR1 schedule. Following extinction, yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) reinstated responding, and this effect was reduced dose dependently by Ro60-0175 (0.3-3 mg/kg, s.c.). In Experiment 3, rats were trained to respond for cocaine on a FR1 schedule in a distinct environmental context (A); responding was then extinguished in a different context (B). Reinstatement tests occurred in either context A or B. Responding was reinstated only when rats were tested in the original self-administration context (A). This reinstatement was reduced dose dependently by Ro60-0175. All effects of Ro60-0175 were blocked by the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB242084. Thus, Ro60-0175, acting via 5-HT2C receptors, reduces cocaine self-administration and cocaine-seeking triggered by a stressor and by drug-associated cues. The effects of Ro60-0175 do not exhibit tolerance within the 8-day test period. These results indicate that selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists may be a useful pharmacological strategy for treatment of drug abuse.",

With this background in mind, the present study was undertaken to monitor the effect of addition of yohimbine (alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) to the effect of fluoxetine (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or venlafaxine (dual reuptake inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine) in Porsolt's forced swim test (FST) using male Laca strain mice. METHOD: The immobility period was recorded in mouse FST during a 6-min period. Different doses of fluoxetine or venlafaxine were administered 30 min before exposing the animals to the test procedure. In the combination study, yohimbine (2 mg/kg i.p.) was administered 15 min before the administration of different doses of fluoxetine or venlafaxine. RESULTS: Fluoxetine (5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) [F = 28.352] or venlafaxine (2, 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg) [F = 17.842] dose-dependently inhibited the immobility period in mice. Addition of yohimbine (2 mg/kg i.p.) potentiated the antidepressant action of fluoxetine or venlafaxine in mouse FST as the animals showed a decrease in the immobility period compared to the fluoxetine or venlafaxine per se group, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study not only demonstrated the association of alpha(2)-receptors in the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine or venlafaxine, but also supports its adjuvant therapy with other antidepressant drugs.",

METHODS: A 20-mg dose of yohimbine was first given to 29 men with orgasmic dysfunction of different aetiology in the clinic. Patients were then allowed to increase the dose at home (titration) under more favourable circumstances. The outcome and side effects were subsequently assessed. RESULTS: The patients were classified into three groups of orgasmic dysfunction: primary complete (13), primary incomplete (8) and secondary (8). Nocturnal emissions were present in 75%, 40% and 50% of patients in the above groups, respectively (overall average 62%). The men presented because of fertility problems (52%) or because they wanted to experience the pleasure of orgasm (48%). Of the 29 patients who completed the treatment, 16 managed to reach orgasm and were able to ejaculate either during masturbation or sexual intercourse. A further three achieved orgasm, but only with the additional stimulation of a vibrator. A history of preceding nocturnal emissions was present in 69% of the men in whom orgasm was induced but only 50% who failed treatment. Of the patients, two have subsequently fathered children (one set of twins) and another 3 men were also cured. Side effects were not sufficient to cause the men to cease treatment.

Chronic opioid stimulation has been reported to induce marked alterations of the locus coeruleus-hippocampus noradrenergic pathway, an effect that is prevented when opioids are coadministered with the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine. The present work tries to examine a possible link between yohimbine reversal of morphine effects and pleiotrophin/midkine activation in the rat hippocampus by studying the levels of expression of pleiotrophin and midkine in response to acute and chronic administration of morphine, yohimbine and combinations of both drugs. Pleiotrophin gene expression was not altered by any treatment; however midkine mRNA levels were increased after chronic treatment with morphine. Chronic administration of yohimbine alone also increased midkine expression levels, whereas yohimbine and morphine administered together exhibited summatory effects on the upregulation of midkine expression levels. The data suggest that midkine could play a role in the prevention of opioid-induced neuroadaptations in hippocampus by yohimbine.",

      "abstract": "The alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (YO) increases transmitter release from adrenergic/noradrenergic (NA) neurons. Systemic YO activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, inhibits feeding, and supports conditioned flavor avoidance (CFA) in rats. To determine whether these effects require NA inputs to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), vehicle or saporin toxin conjugated to an antibody against dopamine beta hydroxylase (DSAP) was microinjected bilaterally into the BNST to remove its NA inputs. Subsequent tests failed to reveal any lesion effect on the ability of YO (5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) to inhibit food intake or to support CFA. Conversely, HPA axis responses to YO were significantly blunted in DSAP rats. In a terminal experiment, DSAP and control rats were perfused 90-120 min after intraperitoneal injection of YO or vehicle. Brains were processed to reveal Fos immunolabeling and lesion extent. NA fibers were markedly depleted in the BNST and medial parvocellular paraventricular hypothalamus (PVNmp) in DSAP rats, evidence for collateralized NA inputs to these regions. DSAP rats displayed significant loss of caudal medullary NA neurons, and markedly blunted Fos activation in the BNST and in corticotropin-releasing hormone-positive PVNmp neurons after YO. We conclude that a population of medullary NA neurons provides collateral inputs to the BNST and PVNmp, and that these inputs contribute importantly to Fos expression and HPA axis activation after YO treatment. Conversely, NA-mediated activation of BNST and PVNmp neurons is unnecessary for YO to inhibit food intake or support CFA, evidence for the sufficiency of other intact neural pathways in mediating those effects.",

This treatment caused dose-dependent impairment of hindlimb locomotor movement, which varied from transient hindlimb paralysis at a dose of 200 microg/20 microl to transient trunk instability at 50 microg/20 microl. Repetitive (every 48 h) injections of yohimbine at high (200 microg/20 microl) and medium (100 microg/20 microl) doses caused tachyphylaxis, which usually led to a lack of reaction to the third injection. This phenomenon was not observed after repetitive injections of the low (50 microg/20 microl) dose of the drug. These results show that the noradrenergic system is involved in the control of locomotion, since intrathecal administration of a specific antagonist affects this activity in intact rats.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess cardiovascular effects and sAA and catecholamine secretion after iv injection of yohimbine. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study at an academic research unit. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen healthy males (aged 20-28 yr) were examined. INTERVENTION: Participants received iv injection of yohimbine (0.4 microg/kg) or placebo (0.9% NaCl). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Eight saliva and blood samples were taken before and after injection for the assessment of salivary flow rate and sAA and catecholamine concentrations. In addition, blood pressure, mood, and anxiety were assessed repeatedly. RESULTS: Yohimbine induced increases of sAA activity and output in comparison to placebo (P = 0.034). Blood pressure (P < 0.001), salivary flow rate (P = 0.007), and catecholamines (P < 0.001) were also significantly increased. No significant correlations between alpha-amylase parameters and catecholamines were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that yohimbine administration activates not only autonomic parameters but also sAA via adrenergic mechanisms, suggesting that sAA might be an indirect indicator of the central sympathetic system.",

Although the role of these two factors in relapse is well documented, it remains unclear as to whether an interaction between stress and drug-associated cues can lead to an enhancement in cocaine-seeking behavior. Here, we assessed the effects of the anxiogenic alpha2-noradrenergic receptor antagonist, yohimbine, on reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in rats either in the presence or absence of cocaine-associated cues. Yohimbine pretreatment in the absence of cocaine-associated cues or cues by themselves reliably reinstated responding on the previously cocaine-paired lever (3-4 times higher than extinction levels). However, animals showed greatly potentiated responding if yohimbine preceded cue-induced reinstatement (10-13 times higher than extinction levels, or 3-5 times over cues or yohimbine alone). While cocaine self-administration produced a significant increase in plasma corticosterone, plasma corticosterone levels did not show a clear relationship to cocaine-paired lever responding during cue and/or yohimbine-induced reinstatement. These results demonstrate that exposure to drug-paired cues during a stressful state can greatly potentiate cocaine-seeking and suggest that future treatment interventions should target multiple modalities.",

      "abstract": "Yohimbine is a potent and relatively nonselective alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist. In an earlier report, we demonstrated that dimeric yohimbine analogs containing methylene and methylene-diglycine tethers were highly selective human alpha(2C)-AR ligands. Little work has been done to examine the role of the tether group or the absence of the second yohimbine pharmacophore on selectivity for human alpha(2)-AR subtypes. The goal of our study was to determine the binding affinities and functional subtype selectivities of a series of tethered yohimbine ligands in the absence of the second pharmacophore. The profiles of pharmacological activity for the yohimbine analogs on the three human alpha(2)-AR subtypes expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells were examined using receptor binding and cAMP inhibition assays. All of the tethered yohimbine analogs exhibited higher binding affinities at the alpha(2C)- versus alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-AR subtypes. Notably, the benzyl carboxy alkyl amine and the carboxy alkyl amine analogs exhibited 43- and 1995-fold and 295- and 54-fold selectivities in binding to the alpha(2C)- versus alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-ARs, respectively. Data from luciferase reporter gene assays confirmed the functional antagonist activities and selectivity profiles of selected compounds from the tethered series. The data demonstrate that the second pharmacophore may not be essential to obtain alpha(2C)-AR subtype selectivity, previously observed with the dimers. Further changes in the nature of the tether will help in optimization of the structure-activity relationship to obtain potent and selective alpha(2C)-AR ligands. These compounds may be used as pharmacological probes and in the treatment of human disorders.",

In this study, we provide in vivo electrophysiological evidence, that microiontophoretic application of yohimbine (YOH) inhibits spontaneous activity of prefrontal neurons of the rat. By microiontophoretic application of the alpha2A-receptor antagonist BRL44408 (BRL), the effects of YOH could be mimicked, indicating that the action of YOH is manifested through alpha2A/D-receptor mechanisms. Furthermore, the inhibiting effects of YOH or BRL were blocked by alpha2B-receptor antagonist imiloxan. In concert with previous microiontophoretic data, the present findings suggest that alpha2-receptor antagonist YOH predominantly acts on the alpha2A/D-receptor subtype in vivo. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this action is manifested via deactivation of autoreceptors causing increased norepinephrine release, finally inhibiting postsynaptic neurons through the activation of alpha2B-receptors.",

Preclinical studies have not explored this clinical problem. Here, we adapted a reinstatement model (commonly used to study relapse to abused drugs) to examine the role of stress and anxiety in relapse to palatable food seeking during dieting. Rats were placed on restricted diet (75-80% of daily standard food) and for 12 intermittent training days (9 h/day, every other day) lever-pressed for palatable food pellets (25% fat, 48% carbohydrate) under a fixed ratio 1 (20-s timeout) reinforcement schedule. Subsequently, the rats were given 10 daily extinction sessions during which lever presses were not reinforced, and were then injected with yohimbine (an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist that induces stress and anxiety in humans and non-humans) or given a single food pellet to assess reinstatement of food seeking. The rats rapidly learned to lever press for the palatable pellets and across the training days the ratio of timeout nonreinforced lever presses to reinforced lever presses progressively increased more than three-fold, suggesting the development of compulsive eating behavior. After extinction, yohimbine injections and pellet priming reliably reinstated food seeking. The corticotropin-releasing factor1 (CRF1) receptor antagonist antalarmin attenuated the reinstatement induced by yohimbine, but not pellet priming. Antalarmin also reversed yohimbine's anxiogenic effects in the social interaction test. These data suggest that CRF is involved in stress-induced relapse to palatable food seeking, and that CRF1 antagonists should be considered for the treatment of maladaptive eating habits.",

The present study was designed to further examine the features of the stimulatory effects of the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists on ejaculation, especially the duration of action. Treatment with yohimbine (0.1 mg/ kg, i.p.) to male dogs, at 0.5, 1, 3, or 5 h before the testing, produced a significant stimulatory effects on the ejaculatory response elicited by manual penile stimulation; the amount of ejaculated semen was increased and the onset of ejaculation was shortened following each treatment. However, such effects were not observed in the treatment with yohimbine at 8 and 24 h before the testing, indicating that the ejaculatory stimulation induced by yohimbine lasted for a relative long period. By contrast, the stimulatory effects of RX821002 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, on ejaculation were observed only for 1 h after administration. To determine the contribution of the alpha2-adrenoceptor blockade for the long-lasting effect of yohimbine, we tested whether yohimbine can prevent the ejaculatory inhibition induced by clonidine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist. The ejaculatory inhibition (a decrease in the amount of ejaculated semen and a delay onset of ejaculation) elicited by clonidine (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.; 1 h before testing) was completely blocked by pretreatment with yohimbine at 1 or 5 h before the testing, whereas the pretreatment with the drug at 24 h before the testing did not affect the clonidine-induced ejaculatory inhibition. These results indicate that yohimbine-induced ejaculatory stimulation is continued for a relative long period (at least 5 h after administration), and this long-lasting effects may be related to the alpha2-adrenoceptor blocking property of the drug.",

Male Wistar rats were trained to reach criterion in the delayed alternation task (0, 25, and 50-s delay intervals). A pilot study found that 3 or 4 mg/kg of yohimbine (intraperitoneal) reduced the choice accuracy of the delayed alternation task in a dose and delay-dependent manner, without influencing motor ability or perseverative behaviour. Acute oral pre-treatment with doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg (but not 25 mg/kg) of extract of Ginkgo biloba prevented the reduction in choice accuracy induced by 4 mg/kg yohimbine.

In the present study, we aimed to examine the potential protective effect of yohimbine, a alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) alterations elicited by chronic morphine treatment. Increased astrogliosis, as indicated by increased GFAP immunohistochemical staining, was observed in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens shell, and frontal cortex of chronic morphine-treated (10 mg kg(-1), i.p., every 12 h for 13 days) rats compared with those treated with saline. Pretreatment with yohimbine (2 mg kg(-1), i.p., 30 min before each morphine injection) provided protection against morphine-induced GFAP upregulation. The present study demonstrates that yohimbine pretreatment reduces long-term morphine exposure-induced alterations in the astroglial reaction, suggesting that alpha(2)-adrenergic mechanisms may play an important role in mediating morphine-induced pathological effects in the brain.",

Mice were first submitted to a 2 week drug-free unpredictable chronic mild stress before the onset of the treatments. The unpredictable chronic mild stress regimen induced a degradation of the state of the coat and decreased the grooming behaviour in the splash test. These physical and behavioural abnormalities were counteracted by tramadol and desipramine. Furthermore, we observed neither a significant acceleration nor diminution by pindolol (5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) on the antidepressant-like actions of desipramine and tramadol whereas yohimbine (alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, 2 mg/kg, i.p.) antagonized the antidepressant-like effects of both drugs during the unpredictable chronic mild stress regimen. The results of the study support the suggestion that antidepressant-like effect of tramadol and desipramine in mice in the unpredictable chronic mild stress model is mediated by the noradrenergic system rather than the serotonergic system.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Interaction of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for the treatment of erectile dysfunction with organic nitrates could lead to severe hypotension. NMI 861 is a combination of 7.7 mg yohimbine tartrate and 6 g l-arginine glutamate. A similar oral combination, which contains the same amount of yohimbine and L-arginine, has been shown to improve erectile function in previous studies. METHODS: In two placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover design studies we aimed to assess first the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single oral dose of NMI 861 administered in 16 healthy male subjects, and then the pharmacodynamics of orally administered NMI 861 in combination with intravenous nitroglycerine (GTN) in 12 healthy male subjects. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures, pulse rate and adverse events were measured in each study. RESULTS: NMI 861 was well tolerated by all subjects with no significant adverse reactions reported. For L-arginine, mean C(max) +/- SEM (range) was 42 +/- 2.2 (28-63) microg ml(-1) and t(max) (range) was 0.88 (0.50-1.5) h. AUC and t(1/2) were not calculated for L-arginine because of the presence of endogenous concentrations and the contribution from food sources. For yohimbine, mean C(max) was 42 +/- 11 (2.8-128) ng ml(-1); t(max) was 0.57 (0.25-1.0) h; mean AUC(0,8 h) was 65 +/- 24 (5.4-332), ng ml(-1) h and t(1/2) was 1.0 +/- 0.34 (0.40-6.0) h. There was a small but significant difference in the mean change from baseline for SBP from 0 to 6 h after NMI 861 treatment compared with placebo (0.8 +/- 1.4 vs-4.1 +/- 2.1 mmHg, respectively; 95% CI 0.0, 9.8 mmHg (P = 0.047)). There was no significant difference in SBP between treatments for the studied periods 6-12 h and 12-24 h. There was no significant difference in DBP or pulse between NMI 861 and placebo treatments for the three studied time periods. In the study designed to investigate the interaction of organic nitrate with NMI 861, subjects were infused intravenously with increasing doses of GTN (15 min each dose) at 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 microg min(-1) starting 40 min after a single oral dose of either NMI 861 or placebo. There was no significant difference in the hypotensive response induced by GTN between the NMI 861 and placebo treatments. The mean maximum changes from baseline during GTN infusion for subjects administered with either NMI 861 or placebo were a decrease of 16.9 +/- 3.4 vs 13.6 +/- 2.4 mmHg (mean difference between treatments -3.3 mmHg, 95% CI -12.7, 6.0 mmHg (P = 0.460)) for SBP, a decrease of 14.7 +/- 2.0 vs 14.0 +/- 2.0 mmHg for DBP (mean difference -0.7 mmHg, 95% CI -8.2, 6.8 mmHg (P = 0.835)), and an increase of 11.8 +/- 1.9 vs 14.1 +/- 2.4 beats min(-1) for pulse, respectively (mean difference -2.3 beats min(-1), 95% CI -9.3, 4.5 beats min(-1) (P = 0.464)). CONCLUSIONS: Acute oral administration of NMI 861 was found to be well tolerated and bioavailable in healthy male subjects and no significant hypotensive interaction with intravenous GTN was detected at the doses investigated.",

      "abstract": "Penile erection involves relaxation of smooth muscle of corpus cavernosum and associated arterioles. Sildenafil, a highly selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5, is effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of sildenafil on smooth muscle of the rabbit corpus cavernosum (RCC) and to compare its effect with those of phentolamine, yohimbine and L-arginine. The effects of sildenafil, phentolamine, yohimbine and L-arginine were studied on the response of the RCC to electrical field stimulation (EFS) as well as on the phenylephrine (PE, 3 x 10(-6) M)-induced tone. EFS caused transient, frequency-dependent relaxation of the RCC that was inhibited by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (3 x 10(-5) M). Sildenafil (1 x 10(-9)-1 x 10(-6) M) and phentolamine (1 x 10(-9)-1 x 10(-6) M) enhanced the EFS-induced relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner with ED50 of 0.056 +/- 0.004 and 0.572 +/-0.035 microM at 8 Hz, respectively, yohimbine (3 x 10(-7)-3 x 10(-5) M) and L-arginine (3 x 10(-6)-3 x 10(-4) M) did not show significant effects (ED50 at 8 Hz = 35.84 +/-2.24 and 2.164 +/- 0.174 microM, respectively). Sildenafil (1 x 10(-9) and 1 x 10(-8) M) potentiated the EFS-induced relaxation caused by L-arginine (3 x 10(-5) m). Sildenafil, phentolamine, yohimbine and L-arginine reduced the PE-induced tone to different extents; the ED50 values were 0.81 +/- 0.097, 0.49 +/- 0.025 and 13.97 +/- 1.10 microM, respectively. Maximum concentration of L-arginine used failed to produce 50% relaxation (ED20 = 221.82 +/- 15.71 microM). The muscle relaxant effects of different combinations of sildenafil and L-arginine on PE-induced tone did not differ significantly from the sum of the individual effects. The results demonstrate that sildenafil, when compared to other drugs used in penile erection dysfunction, shows the highest potency on the nitrergic transmission in the RCC. On the other hand, phentolamine was found to possess the highest potency in inducing relaxation of RCC proving that its action is independent on the stimulated neurogenic system. In addition, the combination of less effective doses of sildenafil and L-arginine has a potential advantage on erectile functions. The importance of this combination remains to be solved clinically.",

      "abstract": "Electrophysiological studies suggest that alpha2-adrenoceptors profoundly affect monoaminergic neurotransmission by enhancing noradrenergic tone and serotonergic firing rates. Recent reports suggest that alpha2-antagonism may hasten and improve the response to antidepressant medications. To test this hypothesis, a randomized double-blind controlled trial was undertaken to determine if the combination of an alpha2-antagonist (yohimbine) with a selective serotonin reuptake agent (SSRI) (fluoxetine) results in more rapid onset of antidepressant action than an SSRI agent alone. In all, 50 subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder confirmed by SCID interview were randomly assigned to receive either fluoxetine 20 mg plus placebo (F/P) or fluxetine 20 mg plus a titrated dose of yohimbine (F/Y). The yohimbine dose was titrated based on blood pressure changes over the treatment period, in a blind-preserving manner. Hamilton depression scale ratings (HDRS) and clinical global impression (CGI) ratings were obtained weekly over a period of 6 weeks. The rate of achieving categorical positive responses was significantly more rapid in the F/Y group compared to the F/P group using both the HDRS and the CGI scales as outcome measures in a survival analysis using a log-rank test (chi2(1) = 5.86, p = 0.016 and chi2(1) = 5.29, p = 0.021, respectively). At the last observed visit, 18 (69%) of the 26 F/Y subjects met the response criteria for CGI compared to 10 (42%) of 24 F/P subjects. Using the HDRS criteria, 17 (65%) of 26 F/Y subject vs 10 (42%) of 24 F/P subjects were responders. The addition of the alpha2-antagonist yohimbine to fluoxetine appears to hasten the antidepressant response. There is also a trend suggesting an increased percentage of responders to the combined treatment at the end of the 6-week trial.",

In this study we analysed the effects of iontophoretically applied yohimbine on 79 prefrontal cortical (PFC) neurons of the rat in vivo. Our results indicate the inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on PFC neurons, which was simulated by yohimbine. The effect of yohimbine was not blocked by known alpha1 or postsynaptic alpha2 receptor agents. These results indicate that yohimbine exerts its antagonising and hyperpolarising effect on presynaptic rather than postsynaptic alpha2 receptors. Since these receptors have a permissive role in maintaining neural activity, their malfunction may contribute to the behavioural deficits observed in prefrontal disorders.",

Temperature, heart rate, respiratory frequency, mean arterial pressure, degree of sedation, mean time of tranquilization and diameter of pupils were monitored for 360 min. Sedation, loss of reflexes, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, bradypnea and mydriasis were observed in Group A, with 3rd eyelid prolapse, increased diuresis and vomiting in some animals. Yohimbine reversed all alterations induced by amitraz, but induced significant cardiorespiratory effects such as tachycardia and tachypnea.

      "abstract": "The possible participation of the central noradrenergic system in the expression of the ejaculatory reflex of the rat was explored by evaluating the effects of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, on the exhausted coital reflex model. Male sexually experienced Wistar rats, subjected to the coital reflex exhaustion paradigm received a single i.v. injection of yohimbine (10 microg/animal), immediately after reaching exhaustion. Enhancement of noradrenergic transmission by yohimbine provoked the immediate expression of a single ejaculatory genital motor pattern (GMP) similar to a first reflexively evoked one, but in the absence of urethral mechanical stimulation. Pre-treatment with clonidine (10 microg/animal) completely prevented the yohimbine-induced GMP, implying that its effect was exerted upon alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. Clonidine treatment per se induced the expression of a single GMP, similar to a last reflexively evoked one, that was completely blocked by pre-treatment with prazosin (1 microg/animal) indicating that it was due to the alpha(1) properties of clonidine. Administration of prazosin previous to yohimbine did not interfere with the expression of the GMP but attenuated it, suggesting the involvement of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in the yohimbine-induced motor response. Data reveal a facilitatory influence of the noradrenergic system on ejaculatory function mediated by both alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and support the notion of yohimbine acting at a spinal level.",

      "abstract": "Cues associated with dangerous or rewarding outcomes can themselves elicit neural activation. Previous work in rats has shown that cues associated with morphine, cocaine, nicotine or palatable food can elicit enhanced expression of the immediate-early gene product Fos in discrete brain regions. Activation of the prefrontal cortex has been shown to be particularly prominent. Some studies have also shown prefrontal cortical activation following exposure to fear-inducing stimuli. To investigate the specificity of regional brain Fos activation, we treated rats with an anxiogenic drug, yohimbine (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)), or water once per day for 10 consecutive days in a test environment distinct from their home cages. Yohimbine elicited a robust locomotor response that progressively sensitized over days. After a 4-day interval, rats were reintroduced to the paired environment, without drug treatment. Rats re-exposed to the environment where they had previously been treated with yohimbine showed conditioned increases in motor activity compared with controls. Fos expression was increased in several brain regions, including the basolateral amygdala, but was unchanged in prefrontal cortex, in contrast to what has been reported for rewarding drugs. These observations show a neural activation profile elicited by cues associated with the anxiogenic drug yohimbine and further support the hypothesis that prefrontal cortex has a specific role in reward expectancy.",

      "abstract": "The present study examined the sleep-wake cycle effects of microinjections of yohimbine, an adrenergic antagonist, and atropine, a cholinergic antagonist, into the cerebral ventricle of clomipramine-induced depressed rats. Yohimbine microinjection caused a significant reduction in the total duration and the number of REM sleep episodes compared to control saline injections. Atropine microinjection caused a significant reduction in the total duration and the number of REM sleep episodes without changing the REM sleep latency compared to control saline microinjection. These results show for the first time that the REM sleep disturbances observed in clomipramine-treatment induced depressed rats can be attenuated by increasing and decreasing the brain noradrenergic and cholinergic activities, respectively.",

Twenty-four women participated in three treatment sessions in which self-report and physiological (vaginal photoplethysmograph) sexual responses to erotic stimuli were measured following treatment with either L-arginine glutamate (6 g) plus yohimbine HCl (6 mg), yohimbine alone (6 mg), or placebo, using a randomized, double-blind, three-way cross-over design. Sexual responses were measured at approximately 30, 60, and 90 min postdrug administration. The combined oral administration of L-arginine glutamate and yohimbine substantially increased vaginal pulse amplitude responses to the erotic film at 60 min postdrug administration compared with placebo. Subjective reports of sexual arousal were significantly increased with exposure to the erotic stimuli but did not differ significantly between treatment groups.",
