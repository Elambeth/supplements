      "abstract": "Many studies demonstrate boosting beef omega-3 content causes detrimental effects on product color stability and palatability. The study objective was to determine effects of feeding Great O Plus on ground beef fatty acid composition, color stability, and palatability. Ground Round (90/10) and Chuck (80/20) patties were produced from steers fed either a conventional finishing diet (CON;n = 14) or a conventional finishing diet containing a 10 % extruded proprietary flaxseed, wheat middling, and Nannochloropsis oculata algae blend (OMG; n = 14). To evaluate color stability, patties were displayed under retail conditions for 4 days with objective and subjective color measures collected every 12 h. Cooked patties were rated by both trained and consumer panels to evaluate palatability. Round and Chuck patties produced from steers fed Great O Plus increased (P < 0.01) alpha-linolenic acid content in both product types. Patties from the OMG treatment did not differ in color stability nor palatability measures when compared to CON patties (P < 0.15). When differences occurred, OMG patties had less visual discoloration, decreased lipid oxidation, and greater overall consumer palatability ratings (P < 0.09). While not directly measured in the present study, it is hypothesized the lack of detrimental effects on product color and palatability was due to a combination of the elevated antioxidant content of the Nannochloropsis oculata algae in Great O Plus and lack of measurable long-chain omega-3 fatty acid presence."

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of using different levels of flaxseed in dairy cattle diet on performance and milk fatty acid profile. For this purpose, 9 lactating Holstein cows of the same parity and lactation stage were used. The study followed a crossover design with three periods, three treatment groups, and three cows per group. Each period lasted 21 days, of which 14 days was the adaptation period and 7 days was the data collection period. During the experiment, 2 different concentrate feeds were used, along with corn silage, vetch hay, wet sugar beet pulp, and straw as roughages. Feeds were prepared as a total mixed ration. Cows in control, 1st and 2nd treatment groups received a diet containing 0, 250 and 500 g/d flaxseed, respectively. Adding flaxseed to the diet did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield, feed efficiency, or milk fat, lactose, and urea nitrogen (P > 0.05). However, it increased omega-3 fatty acids in milk and decreased the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids (P < 0.05). Results showed that adding different levels of flaxseed to the diets increased omega-3 fatty acids in milk without negatively affecting performance or fat percentages, making it suitable for producing functional milk.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), affecting 6-15% of women of reproductive age, is characterized by hormonal imbalances and metabolic disturbances. Flaxseed, rich in omega-3 fatty acids and phytoestrogens, may offer a natural approach to improve reproductive hormone profiles in PCOS patients. This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of flaxseed supplementation on reproductive endocrine profiles in women with PCOS. METHODS: In this open-labeled, randomized controlled trial, 70 women with PCOS were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=35), receiving 30 grams of milled flaxseed daily along with lifestyle modifications, or the control group (n=35), receiving only lifestyle modifications, for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Secondary outcomes included changes in serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), the LH/FSH ratio, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and androstenedione. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the flaxseed group showed a significant increase in FSH levels compared to the control group. FSH levels increased from 9.72 ± 11.95 µU/mL at baseline to 10.59 ± 12.14 µU/mL after the intervention (p = 0.027). The mean treatment effect was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.086 to 1.75). The LH/FSH ratio also significantly decreased in the flaxseed group (mean treatment effect: -0.341, 95% CI: -0.63 to -0.08, p = 0.031). No significant changes were observed in AMH, LH, estradiol, DHEAS, or androstenedione levels. CONCLUSION: Flaxseed supplementation may benefit women with PCOS by increasing FSH levels and decreasing the LH/FSH ratio, suggesting its potential as a complementary intervention for managing hormonal disturbances in PCOS. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the impacts of feeding a rumen-protected matrix of fat and protein from flaxseed and peas (LinPRO-R, LIN; approximately 21% fat, 24% CP, and 10.07% omega-3 FA; % of DM) on ruminal fermentation, nutrient degradability, and methane emissions, in vitro. Treatments were: 0 (0P), 2.5 (2.5P), 5 (5P), and 7.5% (7.5P) of DM inclusion of LIN, with LIN replacing portions of dried distiller's grains and calcium salts of long-chain fatty acids in the diet to maintain similar levels of CP and EE. In Experiment 1, 3 independent runs with 4 replicates per treatment were used, and 0.5 g of each TMR (16% CP, 33% NDF, 28% starch, 4.2% EE; as % of DM) was incubated in buffered ruminal content for 24 and 48 h, for a total of 6 runs, in glass serum bottles. Gas pressure was measured at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 h to estimate total gas and methane productions in the headspace and VFA and lactate concentrations in the fermentation liquid phase. Furthermore, OM degradation was measured at 24 and 48 h after bottles were opened. For Experiment 2, twice daily, 53 g of DM of the same treatments was provided to each fermenter. The treatments were arranged in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square using 8 fermenters. Four 10-d experimental periods (7 d adaptation and 3 d sample collection) were done. Samples were collected from fermenter effluents at 3, 6, 9, and 24 h after morning feeding and composited to determine lactate and VFA concentrations and nutrient degradation. Experiment 1 data was analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX of SAS where treatment was a fixed effect and run was a random effect. Experiment 2 data were analyzed similarly, with square, fermenter within square, period, and the fermenter by treatment interaction being random effects. For Experiment 1 with increasing LIN, total gas volume and methane produced per g of OM degraded decreased linearly, whereas lactate concentration and OM degradability linearly increased. There was no effect of LIN inclusion level on any VFA proportion. For Experiment 2 Butyrate and isobutyrate proportions linearly decreased, and NDF degradation quadratically increased, with increasing inclusion of LIN. There were no differences for any other VFA proportions, the total concentration of all VFA, lactate concentration, or the degradation of DM, OM, or CP. Thus, inclusion of LIN, with its higher concentration of omega-3, can occur without impairing ruminal fermentation and nutrient degradation, and alters the fermentation profile to reduce total gas volume and methane produced per g of OM degraded as well as favor other VFA rather than butyrate or isobutyrate and increasing fiber degradation."

      "abstract": "Background Perimenopause is a transitional phase leading to menopause, increasing the risk of various associated diseases. Given the potential adverse effects of long-term conventional treatments, flaxseed serves as a promising nonpharmacological alternative for perimenopausal prevention. Objective Given the limited research on perimenopause and the potential of flaxseed as a prophylactic therapy for associated symptoms and their severity in later stages or before menopause, this study aims to examine the effects of flaxseed on perimenopausal symptom severity and its relationship with dietary nutrient intake. Methods Data from 145 participants in this randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial were analyzed and compared before and after the intervention in two groups: Group A (flaxseed) and Group B (placebo). The study aimed to evaluate the impact of flaxseed on the severity of perimenopause-related symptoms and dietary nutrient intake while also assessing the relationship between symptom severity and dietary nutrients. Results The study's findings reveal that flaxseed supplementation significantly reduced the severity of perimenopausal symptoms compared to the placebo (p < 0.001), with effect sizes ranging from -0.86 to -1.55. Among the nutrients analyzed - energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, iron, and calcium - only energy, fiber, calcium, and iron showed significant changes from baseline to follow-up in the flaxseed group compared to the placebo. Additionally, significant correlations were observed between symptom severity and dietary nutrient intake. Specifically, sleep disturbances were significantly associated with energy intake (before intervention: r = 0.251, p = 0.024; after intervention: r = 0.265, p = 0.018), while vaginal dryness was significantly correlated with fiber intake (before intervention: r = 0.402, p = 0.001; after intervention: r = 0.267, p = 0.017). Conclusions Flaxseed may help alleviate certain perimenopausal symptoms, making it a useful supplemental nonpharmacological preventive therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) seeds are in the spotlight due to their enormous potential as a functional food ingredient, and proteins and peptides play a crucial role in their functional food properties. Flax seeds can be added to foods during production either before or after heat pre-treatment (roasting), creating the need for thermally stable peptides as markers for flax seed identification. In this study, the proteins of untreated and roasted seeds of three flax cultivars (Jantarol, Oliwin and Szafir) were analyzed by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) to search for species-specific peptides as potential markers of flax seeds. RESULTS: Twenty-three proteins found in untreated seeds of each cultivar were selected using UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. After roasting, six of them were identified based on 13 unique and species-specific peptides, and they have been suggested as potential thermally stable species-specific markers for the identification of flax seed proteins. Among them, one new unique and thermally stable peptide, DPVLAWR, was found that had not been identified in previous studies. CONCLUSION: Our research has provided novel information on the protein and peptide identification of flax seeds taking into account possible cultivar diversity. In the study, the proteomics UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS method was applied. In addition, heat-stable peptides were determined as a potential indicator for the identification of flax seeds after roasting, a process often used for oilseed pre-treatment. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "Flaxseed-derived peptide IPPF has been reported to effectively inhibit cholesterol micellization and reduce cholesterol accumulation in vitro. However, its effects on hepatic cholesterol accumulation and related dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in vivo, along with the underlying mechanisms and specific molecular targets, remain unclear. This study investigated the impact of IPPF on hepatic cholesterol accumulation to ameliorate MASLD and its potential mechanisms in vivo. Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-cholesterol, high-fat diet and treated with different doses of IPPF via oral gavage for six weeks. IPPF intervention significantly reduced hepatic cholesterol levels and oxidative stress damage while increasing fecal cholesterol and bile acid excretion. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis revealed that IPPF primarily affected pathways related to ABC transporters and bile acid metabolism. IPPF intake upregulated the mRNA expression of Abcg5/8 and Cyp7a1 in the liver. Molecular docking, dynamics and Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) simulations demonstrated that IPPF binds strongly to ABCG5/8 and CYP7A1, forming stable complexes. Furthermore, cholesterol accumulation and MASLD in HepG2 cells induced by palmitic acid (PA) was alleviated by IPPF, but this effect was partly stopped when CYP7A1 or ABCG5/8 was inhibited. In conclusion, flaxseed-derived peptide IPPF targets CYP7A1 and ABCG5/8, promoting cholesterol conversion and excretion, thereby reducing hepatic cholesterol accumulation and offering a potential nutritional treatment for MASLD. IPPF can be used as a novel dietary cholesterol-lowering functional ingredient. This study provides a scientific basis and new perspective for the development of cholesterol-lowering functional foods and dietary supplements.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with breast cancer (BC) who benefit from the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor (PDi) is limited, necessitating novel strategies to improve immunotherapy efficacy of BC. Here we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of flaxseed lignans (FL) on the biological behaviors of BC and evaluate the roles of FL in enhancing the anticancer effects of PDi. METHODS: HPLC was used to detect the content of enterolactone (ENL), the bacterial transformation product of FL. Transcript sequencing was performed and identified CD38 as a downstream target gene of ENL. CD38-overexpressing cells were constructed and cell proliferation, colony formation, wound healing and transwell assays were used to assess the function of ENL/CD38 axis on BC cells in vitro. Multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and CyTOF were used to detect the changes of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM). 16S rDNA sequencing was used to explore the changes of gut microbiota in mice. A series of in vivo experiments were conducted to investigate the anticancer effects and mechanisms of FL and PDi. RESULTS: FL was converted to ENL by gut microbiota and FL administration inhibited the progression of BC. ENL inhibited the malignant behaviors of BC by downregulating CD38, a key gene associated with immunosuppression and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade resistance. The mIHC assay revealed that FL administration enhanced CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells and reduced F4/80+ cells in TIM. CyTOF confirmed the regulatory effects of FL and FL in combination with PDi (FLcPDi) on TIM. In addition, 16S rDNA analysis demonstrated that FLcPDi treatment significantly elevated the abundance of Akkermansia and, importantly, Akkermansia administration enhanced the response to PDi in mice treated with antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The FL/ENL/CD38 axis inhibited BC progression. FL enhanced the anticancer effects of PDi by modulating gut microbiota and host immunity.",

This increase has led to higher economic burdens, prompting the search for non-pharmacological methods to manage glucose levels. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of flaxseed consumption on biochemical markers (glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides) in adult patients with Type 2 diabetes in Oaxaca, Mexico. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were recruited and randomized into clinical trials between April and June 2023, and the study protocol was approved by a Human Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: Consuming 16 g of flaxseed daily for three months led to a significant decrease in glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels (p < 0.001) in Type 2 diabetes patients in the intervention group (n = 82). Belonging to the control group (n = 84) was correlated with presenting higher levels of glycated hemoglobin (Spearman's Rho 0.640; p < 0.001), higher levels of glucose (Spearman's Rho 0.352; p < 0.001), total cholesterol (Spearman's Rho 0.796; p < 0.001), and triglycerides (Spearman's Rho 0.700; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A daily intake of 16 g of flaxseed is an effective supplementary treatment for adult Mexican patients with Type 2 diabetes, as evidenced by reduced levels of glycated hemoglobin, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides in the intervention group.

      "abstract": "Oleosomes are intracellular vesicles within a phospholipid monolayer membrane and have significant potential for use in various food applications as natural emulsions. Flaxseed, an underexplored yet promising crop, shows promise for oleosome utilization. However, the high mucopolysaccharide content in hulls may pose challenges to the extraction efficiency of natural flaxseed oleosomes (N-FOs). In this study, two pretreatment methods were employed prior to aqueous extraction: enzymatic hydrolysis using a cellulase-pectinase-xylanase cocktail and dehulling. Both pretreatment methods significantly improved the extraction yield, with dehulling flaxseed oleosomes (D-FOs) achieving 51.3 % and enzymatically hydrolyzed flaxseed oleosomes (E-FOs) reaching 53.1 %, representing an increase by a factor of five compared to N-FOs. The average droplet size of E-FOs ranged from 1.5 to 1.7 μm across pH 2.0 to pH 10.0, while the absolute value of the zeta-potential for E-FOs at pH 10.0 was the highest at -39.6 mV. Cryo-SEM imaged that E-FOs and N-FOs exhibited a more complete structure than D-FOs, which might be attributed to the increased electrostatic repulsion generated by flaxseed protein and spatial hindrance of incompletely hydrolyzed polysaccharides. LF-NMR spectra showed shorter T2 values of E-FOBs, confirming increased interactions between residual polysaccharides and oleosomes. The tight and solid-like interfacial film affirmed by the emulsifying activity and rheological results could protect emulsion droplets against flocculation and disproportionation, thus contributing to enhanced emulsification stability. Enzymatic hydrolysis demonstrated a favorable balance between extraction yield and functional properties compared to dehulling or no pretreatment, making it a suitable approach for efficient oleosome extraction from flaxseeds for various plant-based food applications.",

      "abstract": "Camelina sativa is an oilseed crop rich in α-linolenic acid (ALA), an n-3 fatty acid (FA), and is resistant to harsh climates and pests. Previously, supplementation with camelina oil (CAM) in horses had no adverse effects on basic health parameters and had comparable skin and coat parameters as both flaxseed oil (FLX) and canola oil (OLA). Further, the plasma FA profile of horses was reflective of their respective treatment oil. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of dietary CAM supplementation on skin FA profile, immune, and inflammatory responses as compared to 2 commonly used oils in the equine industry, OLA and FLX, in healthy adult horses. Twenty-four adult horses, from 2 separate herds, were enrolled in this experiment. The horses underwent a gradual 4-wk fat acclimation period to sunflower oil (approximately 0.28% ALA), then were supplemented with either CAM (approximately 34.9% ALA), OLA (approximately 12.0% ALA), or FLX (56.0% ALA) at an inclusion rate of 0.37 g/kg body weight (BW) per day for an additional 16 wk. Immune and inflammatory responses were assessed by measuring antibody concentrations across time after sensitization to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) at weeks 10 and 12, and a subsequent delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) challenge. Skin biopsy samples were collected at weeks 0, 8, and 16, and FA composition was determined using gas-chromatography. All data were analyzed as a repeated measures ANOVA using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. Antibody and DTH responses to KLH did not differ among groups (P = 0.262 and 0.813, respectively), and no treatment by time effects were observed (P = 0.764 and P = 0.817, respectively). Most FA in the skin changed in composition across time, with the sum of n-3 FA increasing (P < 0.001) and the sum of n-6 FA and skin n-6:n-3 ratio decreasing over time (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Only dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (P = 0.025) and the sum of n-3 FA (P = 0.031) had treatment-by-week effects. At week 16, the composition of eicosapentaenoic acid in the skin was greater in FLX than OLA, but neither differed from CAM (P = 0.049). These results suggest that ALA supplementation may beneficially impact skin FA profile. However, due to the small differences in n-3 FA and n-6:n-3 ratio among CAM, FLX, and OLA, a comparable skin FA profile, immune, and inflammatory response was observed among treatments at a dose of 0.37 g oil/kg BW. Therefore, CAM may be a suitable alternative to FLX in equine diets for the delivery of ALA.",

      "abstract": "Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a growing public health problem worldwide, and dietary interventions have important potential in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Moreover, previous animal studies have shown that flaxseed has a good improvement effect in animal NAFLD models. Objectives: Assess whether flaxseed powder could improve the liver lipid content in patients with NAFLD. Methods: In this 12-week randomized controlled clinical trial, 50 patients were randomly assigned to the flaxseed group (n = 25) and the control group (n = 25). The flaxseed group received 30 g d-1 flaxseed powder orally before lunch or dinner along with health education, while the control group received only health education. The primary outcome was the intrahepatic lipid content assessed by the proton density fat fraction estimated by magnetic resonance imaging, and secondary outcomes were body composition measurements, liver function, and glucolipid metabolism. Results: Patients in the flaxseed group showed significantly lower liver fat content, body fat percentage, obesity index, visceral fat area, serum total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels after a 12-week intervention compared to pre-intervention levels, while serum apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly increased, with all differences being statistically significant (P < 0.05). Analysis of the gut microbiota showed that, at the phylum level, flaxseed intervention significantly increased the abundance of Bacteroides and Actinobacteria, while decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Parasutterella, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group, and Bifidobacterium in the gut microbiota of the flaxseed group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05), whereas the relative abundance of Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002 was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Flaxseed powder intervention for 12 weeks had the effect of improving liver lipid deposition, liver function, body composition indicators, and lipid metabolism in patients with NAFLD. It also regulated the gut microbiota in NAFLD patients, increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria while reducing harmful bacteria. This suggested that flaxseed is one of the natural and effective foods for improving NAFLD.",

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of chamomile and flaxseed on pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea in endometriosis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted on 102 endometriosis patients referred to Reyhane Infertility Center of Qom University of Medical Sciences, Iran, from July 2021 to March 2022. Patients were divided into three groups: chamomile, flaxseed, and placebo, using the block randomization method. Patients used 1000 mg capsules (three times a day) for 8 weeks. A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure the severity of pain. Pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea were assessed on three occasions Data were analyzed using the Chi-square, repeated measures ANCOVA, and ANOVA. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the three groups regarding dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, or dyspareunia (p > 0.05). The mean score of pelvic pain (on one and two-month follow-ups) in the chamomile and flaxseed groups (F = 383.07, p < 0.001) was lower than that in the placebo group. The mean score of dyspareunia (on one and two-month follow-ups) in the chamomile and flaxseed groups was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (F2 = 479.34, p < 0.001). The mean score of dysmenorrhea on one and two-month follow-ups (F2 = 385.67, p < 0.001) in the chamomile and flaxseed groups was lower than that in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Chamomile and flaxseed may reduce pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea associated with endometriosis."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease that severely impairs patient's life quality and represents significant therapeutic challenge due to its pathophysiology arising from skin barrier dysfunction. Topical corticosteroids, the mainstay treatment for mild to moderate AD, are usually formulated into conventional dosage forms that are impeded by low drug permeation, resulting in high doses with consequent adverse effects, and also lack properties that would strengthen the skin barrier. Herein, we aimed to develop biomimetic lamellar lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs), offering a novel alternative to conventional AD treatment. METHODS: In screening studies, pseudoternary phase diagrams alongside polarized light microscopy (PLM) and viscosity measurements were utilized. Next, the selected LCCs underwent comprehensive characterization via PLM, small-angle X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, and rheological analysis. Lastly, their performance was evaluated and compared with the commercially available reference medicine in chemical stability study, in vitro permeation testing, in vitro safety assessment using cell proliferation assay, inverted light microscopy, and Raman mapping of keratinocytes, besides gap closure assay performed by live-cell imaging. RESULTS: Formulation (L/T)Ho30, containing the highest amount of lecithin/Tween 80 mixture (21%) and hempseed oil (28%), demonstrated lamellar microstructure with high skin hydration potential and favourable rheological features for skin administration. Moreover, in comparison with the reference medicine, it stood out by providing suitable chemical BD (betamethasone dipropionate) stability, improved 3-fold BD permeation, and excellent biocompatibility with over 85% cell proliferation at all tested concentrations, ensuring keratinocytes' integrity, as well as promoting skin healing with gap closure observed after 36 hours. CONCLUSION: Unique multi-target drug delivery strategy depicted in newly developed bioinspired lamellar LCCs structurally resembling stratum corneum intercellular lipids, with incorporated BD drug, and composed of multifunctional components that synergistically strengthen skin barrier, was presented here and shows a promising approach for improved AD treatment.",

The sensory evaluation revealed that ozone significantly influenced the sensory profile, with notable cucumber and green-grassy aromas. Quantitation of odorants determined by headspace SPME-GC/MS and calculation of odor activity values (OAV) identified nonanal (citrus-like, soapy aroma, OAV 356), (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal (cucumber aroma, OAV 312), (Z)-3-hexenal (green grassy aroma, OAV 326), and hexanal (green grassy aroma, OAV 163) as major odorants. Furthermore, ozonation reduced total sterol content in refined rapeseed oil by 48 % during storage. While ozone did not form POP initially, they were produced during storage, with the most significant impact on rapeseed oil, doubling POP content compared to air and nitrogen treatments.",

Based on its proven in vitro anti-inflammatory activity and mechanism, it is supposed that FL may also exhibit an in vivo effect in treating and preventing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat models were established to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of FL, which were intervened with FL via gavage (50 and 100 mg/kg B.W.) and intraperitoneal injection (10 and 20 mg/kg B.W.). After FL treatment, RA clinical symptoms were significantly alleviated, including reduced toe swelling volume and mitigated bone damage in CIA rats. Moreover, a decline in the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (i.e., TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and RA-related proteins (i.e., MMP-3, COX-2, and 5-LOX) was observed to effectively block the TLR4/NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, FL was discovered to modulate the diversity and composition of intestinal microbiota in CIA rats, where the level of g_Parvibacte, g_Allobaculum, g_Enterococcus, and unclassified_o_Lactobacillales could be significantly increased, whereas the level of Gram-negative bacteria g_Parabacteroides, g_Parasutterella, and g_Paludicola was notably reduced. In conclusion, FL shows promise in RA treatment by inhibiting inflammatory pathways and regulating the gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "This study examined effects of different processing methods on phenolic compounds in flaxseed meal. The optimal SE treatment was 1.0 MPa for 3 min, and the contents of total flavonoids and phenolic acid were 2.26 times and 1.63 times of the control group, respectively. Notably, erucic acid increased 85.76 %. Optimal extrusion conditions (15 % moisture content, 140 °C, 29 hz) led to the presence of rutin and a 2.81 times increase in protocatechuic acid content over the control. Fermenting with 3 % Bacillus subtilis for 4 days yielded gallic acid in bound form and vanillic acid in free form, with protocatechuic acid increasing 40.65 % compared to the control. Among all the treatments, extrusion produced the highest levels of phenolic compounds in flaxseed meal. Each treatment significantly increased the open ring isomer ester phenol (SDG) compared to the control. Overall, various processing methods impacted the phenolic content and composition in flaxseed meal differently."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of the combination of FMD and flaxseed supplementation on surrogate measures of MASLD. METHODS: The present study was conducted as a randomized, parallel, open-label controlled clinical trial on a hundred patients with MASLD for 12 weeks. Eligible participants were assigned to four groups including control group (lifestyle modification recommendations); flaxseed group (30 g/day of flaxseed powder consumption); FMD group (16 h of fasting per day), and combination of FMD with flaxseed. Changes in anthropometric parameters, serum levels of lipids, glycemic measures, High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and liver enzymes, and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis by transient elastography were assessed. RESULTS: Serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose and insulin, hs-CRP and liver enzymes decreased in all intervention groups. Hepatic steatosis score decreased in the intervention groups, but not significantly in comparison to the control group. Hepatic fibrosis score decreased significantly in the intervention groups compared to control. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the combination of FMD with flaxseed consumption is not superior to either of the interventions alone in the management of MASLD.",

Three databases (PubMed [MEDLINE], Scopus, and ISI Web of Science) were searched from inception up to August 10, 2024. Relevant studies meeting our eligibility criteria were obtained. A random-effects model was used to estimate pooled weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The methodological quality of individual studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. A total of 5 studies were included and analyzed using STATA software version 12. The results show that there is a significant decrease in systolic BP (WMD, -8.64 mmHg; 95% CI, -15.41 to -1.87; p ≤ 0.001) and diastolic BP (WMD, -4.87 mmHg; 95% CI, -8.37 to -1.37; p = 0.006) of patients with hypertension as compared to control groups. This study supported that flaxseed supplementation had favorable effects on BP control in hypertensive patients. It may be a promising adjuvant therapy for patients with hypertension."

Flaxseed oil (FO), a dietary oil rich in α-linolenic acid, has been demonstrated to possess a diverse array of health benefits. However, whether FO protects against PFOS-induced liver injury and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. C57/BL6 mice were orally treated with different concentrations of FO alone or in combination with 10 mg/kg of PFOS for 28 consecutive days. Blood and liver tissues were collected for proteomic, histopathological, biochemical, immunohistochemical, and molecular examinations. Results demonstrated that FO supplementation reduced PFOS-induced liver injury, as evidenced by a decrease in histopathological changes, serum transaminase (ALT and AST) levels, levels of oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) levels. Proteomic analyses showed that differentially expressed proteins were enriched in cholesterol metabolic pathways when comparing the PFOS group to the FO supplementation groups. The expression of cholesterol metabolism-related proteins was also subsequently measured, revealing that FO supplementation decreased the protein expressions of SREBP2, HMGCR, and LDLR while increasing the expression of CYP7A1. This study demonstrates that FO can alleviate PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity by regulating hepatic cholesterol metabolism, indicating that FO may serve as an effective dietary intervention for preventing liver injury caused by PFOS.",

It has beneficial properties that improve hormonal effects that may influence chronic disorders. Objective This study aims to evaluate the impact of flaxseed supplementation on perimenopausal syndrome symptoms and serum polyphenol metabolites enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL). Methods Recruitment of 145 perimenopausal women from Queen Mary's Hospital OPD in K.G.M.U. Lucknow, India, was done for this single-blind randomized placebo-controlled experiment, considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. We randomly divided subjects into two groups using a computer-generated random number table. The intervention group A received 10 grams of flaxseed powder, while the placebo group B received 10 grams of roasted wheat flour for a continuous three months. We measured their demographic characteristics, menopausal symptoms score using the modified Kupperman's index (KI), the menopause rating scale (MRS), and the menopause-specific quality of life (MENQOL) intervention questionnaire. Moreover, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), biochemical parameters (ED, EL) were assessed both at baseline and after three months. For the statistical analysis, Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 24; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY) was employed. Result The study involved 123 individuals, with 22 subjects losing out during follow-up. From baseline to follow-up comparison, the intervention group demonstrated an average percentage decline in the final score of the KI, MRS, and MENQOL intervention questionnaire of -47.25%, -54.05%, and -50.39%, respectively, while the placebo group demonstrated an average percentage decline of -3.83%, -4.91%, and -7.92%, respectively. From baseline to follow-up, ED and EL levels increased by 2.81-fold and 8.55-fold in the intervention group and decreased by 0.25-fold and 0.27-fold in the placebo group. Conclusion Following three months of supplementation, the intervention group showed substantially lower menopausal symptoms (p < 0.001), and ED and EL levels were considerably higher (p < 0.001). Therefore, flaxseed might ameliorate the symptoms associated with perimenopause."

Adult male Wistar rats were divided randomly into five groups. To induce nephrotoxicity, animals received DZN (70 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Also, treatment groups received FS-oil (100 and 200 mg/kg/day, p.o.). The animal treatment was 28 consecutive days. On the 29th day, serum and kidney tissue samples were removed and serum levels of the creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT), were measured. Also, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was applied for histological studies. DZN significantly increased the BUN, creatinine, and MDA levels compared to the control group. Besides, DZN significantly decreased the GPx and CAT activity in the kidney tissue. However, the modulatory effects of FS-oil were observed by improving renal enzyme factors, inhibiting oxidative stress, and histological change. This study demonstrated that FS-oil ameliorated DZN-induced nephrotoxicity and can be used as a preventive agent against DZN toxicity because of the FS-oil antioxidant characteristics.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mastalgia, a common complaint among women, denotes breast discomfort that can manifest as cyclical or non-cyclical. Reassurance, mechanical support and various non-pharmacological treatments, like flaxseeds, have been seen to have a good effect in treating mastalgia. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigates the efficacy of flaxseed in alleviating pain associated with mastalgia and its impact on the overall health-related quality of life among female patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conducted at a tertiary care center in Northern India over 18 months, it employed a single-arm interventional design. The participants included females aged 18 years and older presenting with breast pain at the Department of General Surgery. The intervention involved daily consumption of 30 g of milled flaxseed for each participant, administered over a period of six months. Pain severity was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) before supplementation and at follow-up intervals up to six months. Concurrently, the Short Form-12 (SF-12) items Health Survey measured health-related quality of life, encompassing both physical and mental health domains. Statistical analysis employed parametric (paired t-test) and non-parametric tests (chi-square, McNemar) where appropriate, with statistical significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: Two hundred women with mastalgia were included with a significant reduction in mean VAS scores from 6.03±0.83 at baseline to 2.19±0.66 at six months post-intervention (p = 0.0001). This reduction in pain intensity demonstrated a positive correlation with duration of flaxseed supplementation, notably declining after the initial three months. The mean difference in physical and mental SF-12 score at first visit and at 6 months after intervention was significant (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study underscores the potential of flaxseed as a therapeutic option for managing mastalgia and enhancing health-related quality of life among affected individuals."

Flaxseed oil (FO) is a dietary oil abundant in α-linolenic acid and has been demonstrated to possess multiple health benefits. However, whether FO protects against PFOS-induced testicular injury and its mechanism remain unclear. Methods: C57/BL6 mice were gavaged with different concentrations of FO or PFOS (10 mg kg-1) for 28 days. Blood and testicular tissues were collected for histopathology, proteomics, and biochemical and molecular analyses. Results: Our results showed that FO supplementation significantly attenuated PFOS-induced testicular injury, as indicated by histopathological changes, decreased oxidative stress level, increased sperm count, decreased rate of sperm malformation, and improved functional markers of spermatogenesis. Proteomic analysis showed that differentially expressed proteins were notably enriched in spliceosome pathways. Machine learning algorithms were used to screen the hub gene, and PRPF3 and PUF60 proteins were found to be important for FO to exert protective benefits to testicular injury. Western blot results confirmed that FO supplementation could increase the protein expression of PRPF3 and decrease the protein expression of PUF60 in PFOS-exposed mice. Conclusions: This study revealed that FO can alleviate PFOS-induced testicular dysfunction by regulating RNA alternative splicing. The spliceosome-related proteins PRPF3 and PUF60 may be the potential targets for FO to alleviate PFOS-induced testicular injury. FO supplementation may be an effective dietary intervention to prevent adverse effects of PFOS on testes.",

However, FLMs are easily degraded during thermal treatment in emulsions, which further influences their interfacial properties and application. In this work, the interfacial properties of FLMs between oil and water were evaluated using compression isotherms and interfacial tension to investigate the regulation mechanism of FLMs and their heat-treated products on the stability of O/W emulsions. Furthermore, the improvement mechanism of FLM heat-treated products on the physicochemical stability of flaxseed oil emulsions was clarified. Studies showed that thermal degradation occurred on terminal phenolic acids in FLMs when treated under 100 and 150 °C (FLM-100 and FLM-150) without any decrease in antioxidant activity. FLM-100 and FLM-150 improved the physicochemical stability of sunflower lecithin (S90)-stabilized flaxseed oil emulsions and reduced the concentration of hydroperoxides and TBARS by 26.7% and 80% (p < 0.05), respectively, during storage. This was due to the high interfacial anchoring of FLM-100 and FLM-150, which further strengthened the interface of oil droplets and improved the interfacial antioxidant effect of FLMs. This implies that FLM-100 and FLM-150 could act as new efficient antioxidants for application in food emulsions.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Ferroptosis has been demonstrated to play an important role in various tissue injuries and diseases. Flaxseed oil (FO) has been proven to have benefits for intestinal health. This study aims to explore whether FO relieved lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal injury through modulating ferroptosis signaling pathway. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 120 weaned piglets are fed diets with 3% soybean oil (SO) or 3% FO for 4 weeks. At the end of the trial, 24 piglets selected from two dietary treatment groups are used in a 2 × 2 factorial design with oil treatment (3% SO versus 3% FO) and LPS challenge (saline versus LPS). At 4 h postinjection with LPS, 24 piglets are slaughtered and intestinal samples are collected. FO improves growth performance of pigs. After LPS treatment, FO mitigates intestinal morphological damage and functional damage. Notably, FO reverses the typical ultra-morphology and biochemical indexes of ferroptosis involving glutathione, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal contents. Mechanistically, FO ameliorates the changes on mRNA or protein abundance of key ferroptosis signals including transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFR1), recombinant iron responsive element binding protein 2 (IREB2), FTL, HSPB1, ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), ferroportin 1 (FPN1), SLC7A11, solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and arachidonate-15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15). CONCLUSIONS: FO improves growth performance and mitigates intestinal structural and functional damage, which is involved in regulating ferroptosis signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Flaxseed is known for its numerous health benefits and is often used in the prevention and treatment of civilizational diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of consuming crushed flaxseed on cardiovascular risk in 51 menopausal women. The intervention lasted for 8 weeks, during which participants received a daily dose of 40 g of crushed flaxseed from two varieties with differing lignan contents. Participants were divided into three subgroups based on the variety of flaxseed consumed: (1) high-lignan group (HL), (2) low-lignan group (LL), and (3) control group (no flaxseed consumption). Biochemical blood parameters were measured using a BiOLis 24i Premium automatic analyzer. Body composition was assessed using an InBody 720 device. In the lipid profile, we observed a significant increase in total cholesterol (T-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, along with a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in both the HL and LL groups. Triglyceride (TG) levels exhibited no significant change, whereas high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were significantly reduced in both the HL (p < 0.01) and LL (p < 0.01) groups. Visceral fat area (VFA) and percent body fat (PBF) showed a slight decreasing trend in the HL group, whereas in the LL group, VFA showed a slight increase. Body mass index (BMI) remained stable across all groups. These findings suggest that for the modulation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, the daily dosage, duration of consumption, form of intake, and the specific variety of flaxseed (based on lignan content) are crucial factors."

      "abstract": "Glucose control in postmenopausal women is influenced by many factors, such as hormones, lifestyle variables, and genetics. Limited data exist on the effect of whole flaxseed on glucose status in postmenopausal Native American women. The aim of this study was to investigate the glucose management effect of a flaxseed dietary intervention on postmenopausal Native American women. In this study, 55 Native American postmenopausal women (aged 47-63 years) with borderline hyperglycemia (>100 and <126 mg/dL) and mild to moderate hypercholestorolemia (≥200 to ≤380 mmol/L), who were not on hormone replacement therapy, were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three dietary regimens (control, flaxseed, and flaxseed + fiber) for three months, receiving interventions in the form of bread, muffins, and flaxseed powder. Despite daily consumption of flaxseed across diverse food formats, no significant changes in glucose (p = 0.3, p = 0.2), insulin levels (p = 0.59, p = 0.9), or HOMA-IR (p = 0.84, p = 0.66) were observed compared to their respective baseline values within the flaxseed and flaxseed + fiber groups, respectively. Conversely, the control group showed a significant rise in final glucose values from baseline (p = 0.01). However, the incorporation of ground flaxseed into low-glycemic foods holds potential for beneficial effects through maintaining glucose status among postmenopausal Native American women. This research provides critical insights into the effects of flaxseed, emphasizing the need for continued exploration to understand its role in supporting glucose management among postmenopausal Native American women. Further exploration is required to investigate the potential long-term impact and the use of flaxseed in managing glucose levels in this demographic."

      "abstract": "Exposure to the neurotoxin trimethyltin (TMT) selectively induces hippocampal neuronal injury and astrocyte activation accompanied with resultant neuroinflammation, which causes severe behavioral, cognitive, and memory impairment. A large body of evidence suggests that flaxseed oil (FSO), as one of the richest sources of essential omega-3 fatty acids, i.e., α-linolenic acids (ALA), displays neuroprotective properties. Here, we report the preventive effects of dietary FSO treatment in a rat model of TMT intoxication. The administration of FSO (1 mL/kg, orally) before and over the course of TMT intoxication (a single dose, 8 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced hippocampal cell death, prevented the activation of astrocytes, and inhibited their polarization toward a pro-inflammatory/neurotoxic phenotype. The underlying protective mechanism was delineated through the selective upregulation of BDNF and PI3K/Akt and the suppression of ERK activation in the hippocampus. Pretreatment with FSO reduced cell death and efficiently suppressed the expression of inflammatory molecules. These beneficial effects were accompanied by an increased intrahippocampal content of n-3 fatty acids. In vitro, ALA pretreatment prevented the TMT-induced polarization of cultured astrocytes towards the pro-inflammatory spectrum. Together, these findings support the beneficial neuroprotective properties of FSO/ALA against TMT-induced neurodegeneration and accompanied inflammation and hint at a promising preventive use of FSO in hippocampal degeneration and dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the current combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy is used in the breast-cancer setting, the administration of the anticancer drugs doxorubicin and trastuzumab is associated with an increased risk of developing heart failure. The aim of this study is to determine whether dietary flaxseed is comparable and/or synergistic with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril in the treatment of doxorubicin- and trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity. METHODS: In a chronic in vivo murine model (n = 110), doxorubicin and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, respectively) were administered weekly for 3 weeks. Following this period, the mice were randomized to daily consumption of a 10% flaxseed supplemented diet, administration of perindopril (3 mg/kg) via oral gavage, or a combination of both flaxseed and perindopril for an additional 3 weeks. RESULTS: In mice treated with doxorubicin and trastuzumab, the left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 74% ± 4% at baseline to 30% ± 2% at week 6. Treatment with either flaxseed or perindopril, or with flaxseed and perindopril improved left ventricular ejection fraction to 52% ± 4%, 54% ± 4%, and 55% ± 3%, respectively (P < 0.05). Although histologic analyses confirmed significant loss of sarcomere integrity and vacuolization in the doxorubicin- and trastuzumab-treated mice, treatment with flaxseed or perindopril, or with flaxseed and perindopril improved myocyte integrity. Finally, the level of Bcl-2 interacting protein 3, high-mobility group box 1 protein expression, and the levels of select oxylipins, were significantly elevated in mice receiving doxorubicin and trastuzumab; these markers were attenuated by treatment with either flaxseed or perindopril, or with flaxseed and perindopril. CONCLUSIONS: Flaxseed was equivalent to perindopril at improving cardiovascular remodelling by reducing biomarkers of inflammation, mitochondrial damage, and cell death."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) supplementation has shown promise as an anti-obesity agent in various clinical trials, although results have been inconsistent. To provide a more accurate assessment of the impact of flaxseed supplementation on anthropometric indices, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. METHODS: We searched several international databases until August 2023, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were analyzed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Sixty-four trials comprising 72 treatment arms were included. All studies reported the intervention types (Lignans, Whole flaxseed, and Flaxseed oil) and dosage. However, three studies did testing for purity, and 40 studies reported potency. Also, the risk of contamination with heavy metals was not mentioned in studies. Another limitation was the lack of blind evaluation in the studies. According to three trials included in the systematic review, flaxseed did not affect anthropometric indices. Our meta-analysis revealed significant reductions in body weight (WMD = -0.63 kg; 95 % CI: -1.00, -0.27, P < 0.001; I2 = 76.7 %, P < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (WMD: -0.24 kg/m2, 95 % CI: -0.36, -0.11, P < 0.001; I2 = 78.5 %, P < 0.001) and waist circumference (WC) (WMD: -1.43 cm, 95 % CI: -2.06, -0.80, P < 0.001; I2 = 81.1 %, P < 0.001) following flaxseed supplementation. Subgroup analyses indicated that interventions lasting 10-20 weeks, and studies involving subjects with higher BMI (>30 kg/m2) showed more significant anti-obesity effects. Based on the GRADE evaluation, body weight, BMI, and WC results were considered as moderate-certainty evidence. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that supplementation with flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) leads to meaningful improvements in body weight, BMI, and WC. Therefore, flaxseed can be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic approach in improving obesity.",

Treatment diets were supplemented 60 days before semen collection to afford proper spermatogenesis, adaptation to the feed formulated and fed throughout the study. Semen was collected with the use of artificial vagina following dietary supplementation with five treatment diets (neg. cont. - negative control, pos. cont. - positive control, FLO - 5% Flaxseed oil, ASA - 4% Ascorbic acid, and FLO + ASA). Semen was then extended using tris-based extender and cryopreserved using the programmable freezer (CBS Freezer 2100 series, Laboratory consumables & chemical suppliers, America). Ovaries were collected from a neighbouring slaughter house and conveyed to the lab in 0.9% saline at 37 °C. Data (sperm parameters and in vitro fertility) was then exposed to the GLM (General Linear Model) in Minitab 17. Pearson's correlation coefficient was utilized to investigate the relationship between cryopreserved sperm quality and in vitro fertility. The student Least Significant Difference Test was used to separate the treatment means, and differences were accepted when the p-value was less than 0.05. The FLO + ASA group had higher (p < 0.05) progressive (36.33 ± 1.87), total (88.24 ± 2.24), rapid motility (27.52 ± 1.74), intact plasma membrane (75.67 ± 2.08), total fertilization (65.98 ± 7.39), and total cleavage (66.19 ± 6.50) when compared to other treatment groups. Total fertilization rate had a medium significant (p < 0.001) medium correlation with the progressive motility (r2 = 0.435), total motility (r2 = 0.447) and rapid motility (r2 = 0.409). In conclusion, dietary flaxseed and ascorbic acid (FLO + ASA) improves cryopreserved semen quality, in vitro fertilization rate, and the total cleavage rate. Noteworthy, the progressive, total and rapid motility play a crucial in the in vitro fertilization rate.",

The digestibility of FPI obtained by ultrasound coupled with pH 10/12 cycling (UFPI-10/12) (74.56 % and 79.12 %) was significantly higher than that of native FPI (64.40 %), and UFPI-10 showed higher hydrolysis degree (35.76 %) than FPI (30.65 %) after intestinal digestion. The combined treatment induced transition from α-helix to β-sheet with an orderly structure. Large FPI aggregates broke down into small-sized FPI particles, which induced the increase of specific surface area of particles. This might expose more cutting sites and contact area with enzymes. Furthermore, UFPI-10 showed high antioxidant activity (29.18 %) and lipid-lowering activity (70.52 %). Peptide profiling revealed that UFPI-10 exhibited a higher proportion of 300-600 Da peptides and significantly higher abundance of antioxidant peptides than native FPI, which might promote its antioxidant activity. Those results suggest that the combined treatment is a promising modification method to improve the digestion characteristics and biological activity of FPI.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dental caries in primary teeth remains a critical public health challenge globally. Although fluoride toothpaste is the standard care for remineralization, its efficacy is limited by the requirement for bioavailable calcium and phosphate ions and its diminished performance on irregular dental surfaces. This study evaluates natural alternatives for dental care, focusing on their mineralizing potential compared to fluoride. AIM: This study aims to assess and compare the efficacy of remineralization by flaxseed paste and chicken eggshell paste to that of standard fluoride toothpaste on artificially demineralized primary teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized an in vitro model, creating standardized white spot lesions on extracted primary teeth to simulate early carious lesions. The teeth were treated with preparations of flaxseed paste, chicken eggshell paste, and fluoride toothpaste. Remineralization was quantitatively analyzed using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) conducted with a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM) from Thermoscientific Apreo S at Sir C V Raman Research Park, SRM Institute of Science & Technology, Kattankulathur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis revealed that both flaxseed and chicken eggshell pastes not only met but, in some cases, exceeded the remineralization performance of fluoride toothpaste. Significant differences were observed in the deposition of calcium and phosphate ions on the lesion surfaces. CONCLUSION: The study conducted at the Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry at SRM Dental College, Kattankulathur, confirms the potential of flaxseed and chicken eggshell pastes as viable, cost-effective, and accessible alternatives to fluoride toothpaste for the remineralization of enamel in primary teeth. These findings support the inclusion of these natural agents in oral hygiene regimens and underscore the importance of further research into holistic approaches for the prevention and treatment of dental caries in children."

      "abstract": "The principal function of skin is to form an effective barrier between the human body and its environment. Impaired barrier function represents a precondition for the development of skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD), which is the most common inflammatory skin disease characterized by skin barrier dysfunction. AD significantly affects patients' quality of life, thus, there is a growing interest in the development of novel delivery systems that would improve therapeutic outcomes. Herein, eight novel lyotropic liquid crystals (LCCs) were investigated for the first time in a double-blind, interventional, before-after, single-group trial with healthy adult subjects and a twice-daily application regimen. LCCs consisted of constituents with skin regenerative properties and exhibited lamellar micro-structure, especially suitable for dermal application. The short- and long-term effects of LCCs on TEWL, SC hydration, erythema index, melanin index, and tolerability were determined and compared with baseline. LCCs with the highest oil content and lecithin/Tween 80 mixture stood out by providing a remarkable 2-fold reduction in TEWL values and showing the most distinctive decrease in skin erythema levels in both the short- and long-term exposure. Therefore, they exhibit great potential for clinical use as novel delivery systems for AD treatment, capable of repairing skin barrier function.",

Therefore, this study compares the effects of flaxseed powder and magnesium hydroxide on bowel movements of acute myocardial infarction patients hospitalized in ICU. METHODS: The population of the present parallel randomized controlled clinical trial included 70 acute myocardial infarction patients hospitalized in ICU who had no history of chronic constipation. The patients in the intervention group were given three sachets of flaxseed powder (each sachet was 3 g) twice a day for four days. The patients in the control group were given 20 cc of magnesium hydroxide syrup each morning. The Bristol scale was used to describe stool consistency. RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation of the number of bowel movements within five days after intervention are 1.86 ± 1.08 and 1.6 ± 0.65 in the intervention and the control groups, respectively. The frequency of normal stool consistency of the first bowel movement is 94.3% for the intervention group and 85.7% for the control group, which shows no significant differences between the two groups in terms of stool consistency and bowel movement frequency (P=0.510). The bowel movements started on average after 35.2±97.97 hours in the flaxseed group and 24.771±2.677 hours in the magnesium hydroxide group (P=0.023). CONCLUSION: The results showed that flaxseed powder increases bowel movement frequency and improves the patients' stool consistency, but the differences between the two groups are insignificant. Finally, the time to the first defecation was shorter in the magnesium hydroxide group."

      "abstract": "Flaxseed is the richest source of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, which is converted by ruminal microorganisms primarily to the mammalian lignan enterolactone. Our objective was to investigate the effect of diets containing soybean meal or flaxseed meal (FM) supplemented with sucrose, flaxseed oil, or both, on milk enterolactone concentration yield, diversity, and relative abundance of ruminal bacterial taxa, ruminal fermentation profile, production performance, milk fatty acids (FA) yield, and nutrient utilization in dairy cows. Sixteen Holstein cows (8 multiparous [4 ruminally cannulated] and 8 primiparous) averaging (mean ± SD) 134 ± 54.1 DIM and 679 ± 78.9 kg of BW in the beginning of the study were assigned to treatment sequences in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Each experimental period lasted 25 d, with 18 d for diet adaptation and 7 d for data and sample collection. Diets were formulated to contain a 60:40 forage:concentrate ratio and included the following (DM basis): (1) 8% soybean meal and 23% ground corn (SBM); (2) 15% FM, 10.7% ground corn, and 5% sucrose (FLX+S); (3) 15% FM, 15.4% ground corn, and 3% flaxseed oil (FLX+O); and (4) 15% FM, 10.2% ground corn, 5% sucrose, and 3% flaxseed oil (FLX+SO). Compared with SBM, the concentration and yield of milk enterolactone increased in cows fed the FM diets but did not differ among FLX+S, FLX+O, and FLX+SO. The relative abundances of the phyla Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobiota, and Actinobacteriota, and those of the bacterial genera Lachnospiraceae NK3A20 group, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group, Anaeromusa-Anaeroarcus, WCHB1-41, and p-251-o5 decreased, whereas Prevotella and NK4A214 group increased when comparing SBM against at least 1 diet containing FM. Furthermore, the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota and those of Prevotella, Lachnospiraceae NK3A20 group, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group, Acetitomaculum, Lachnospiraceae unclassified, NK4A214 group, and Anaeromusa-Anaeroarcus changed (increased or decreased) across the FLX+S, FLX+O, and FLX+SO diets. However, all these changes in the relative abundance of the ruminal bacterial taxa were not conclusively associated with the effect of diets on milk enterolactone. Diets did not affect ruminal pH and concentrations of NH3-N and total VFA. Dry matter intake and yields of milk, milk fat, and milk true protein all decreased in cows fed FLX+O or FLX+SO. Yields of milk total odd-chain FA, branched-chain FA, total <16C FA, and total 16C FA decreased with feeding FLX+O and FLX+SO. The apparent total-tract digestibilities of DM and OM were lowest in the FLX+S and FLX+O diets, with CP and ADF digestibilities lowest in cows receiving FLX+S or FLX+O, respectively. Urinary excretion of total N was lowest with feeding SBM. Contrarily, diets did not affect the urinary excretion of total purine derivatives. In brief, despite the effect of diets on the relative abundance of several ruminal microbiota phyla and genera, we were unable to conclusively associate these changes with increased milk enterolactone in FM-containing diets versus SBM.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The present study focused on the formulation of mucoadhesive bilayer composite films for the treatment of periodontitis and evaluation of their physicochemical properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The solvent casting technique was used to prepare films. The primary layer (D) was prepared with flaxseed and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose composite to sustain the release of doxycycline hyclate. The second layer (S) comprised sodium alginate and polyvinyl alcohol composite for faster release of clove oil. Both layers were combined to generate the bilayer film (B). All formulations were characterized further to obtain an optimized formulation. RESULTS: Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared radiation results showed intactness of drug and clove oil in the presence of excipients. The pH of the films was compatible with the periodontal cavity and the thickness was suitable for inserting into the cavity. The immediate release layer showed faster disintegration and swelling. The content of clove oil was above 80%. The rate of swelling of the primary layer was slow and drug content complied with the United States Pharmacopoeia. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed intact, non-porous and smooth films. Films exhibited better mechanical strength and bioadhesiveness. Clove oil was released from the immediate release layer within 10 min, and doxycycline hyclate release was retarded to a minimum of up to 8 h in the primary layer as well as the bilayer. Formulation also had a significant effect on both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: In the current study, bilayers were successfully prepared and characterized. The optimized formulation can be effectively used for the treatment of periodontitis."

      "abstract": "Background Tobacco is prevalently used in smoking or smokeless forms and remains a major public health concern worldwide, with its adverse effects on overall health. Omega-3 fatty acid (FA) has shown its promising effects in various health conditions. Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of flaxseed oil (omega-3 supplementation) on tobacco dependence, craving, withdrawal symptoms, and haematological parameters in tobacco users. Methods In this randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled study, 104 tobacco users (54 in the omega-3 group and 50 in the placebo group) were supplemented with 10 ml of food-grade flaxseed oil and 10 ml of placebo for six months, respectively. Their demographics, frequency of daily tobacco use, tobacco dependence, tobacco craving, tobacco withdrawal symptoms, and complete blood count (CBC) were assessed at baseline (before intervention) and after a six-month intervention. Results The demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar except for gender at baseline. There were 50 males and four females in the omega-3 group, while there were 42 males and eight females in the placebo group. After a six-month flaxseed oil intervention, BMI values showed a significant reduction (p = 0.0081) in the omega-3 group when compared to baseline; however, CBC parameters did not show any significant changes when comparing baseline to follow-up values. On the contrary, haemoglobin and red blood cells (RBCs) showed significant changes when comparing the follow-ups of the omega-3 group with the placebo group, indicating p = 0.0016 and p = 0.0163, respectively. Also, omega-3 effectively decreased daily tobacco use frequency (p<0.0001), tobacco dependence (p<0.0001), and craving (p<0.0001). Conclusion Supplementation of 10 ml of flaxseed oil per day (omega-3 FA) for six months significantly reduced tobacco dependence and cravings. Additionally, the flaxseed oil supplementation effectively reduced the frequency of daily tobacco intake and modulated tobacco withdrawal symptoms. Thus, our results suggest that flaxseed oil supplementation is a useful adjunct for tobacco users who intend to quit tobacco use."

In this study, we examined the effects of flaxseed cake meal (FSCM) on the antioxidative status, lipid metabolism, egg fatty acid profile, and egg health index of white-egg laying hens. A total of 63 Hisex White laying hens were divided into three experimental treatment groups and fed diets containing 0, 5, or 10% FSCM from 48 to 58 weeks of age. Feeding with 5 and 10% FSCM did not significantly (p>0.05) influence total lipid, triglyceride, total cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations, or the high-/low-density lipoprotein ratio in the serum and egg yolk; however, 10% FSCM significantly (P<0.05) increased serum high-density lipoprotein. Dietary FSCM also did not affect (P>0.05) antioxidant markers in the eggs and blood plasma. Notably, dietary inclusion of FSCM significantly increased (P<0.05) total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), α-linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid levels in egg yolk, whereas the n-6:n-3 PUFAs ratio was markedly (P<0.05) decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, including 5-10% FSCM improved (P<0.05) egg health indices, with 10% being the most beneficial. Together, these findings indicated that the inclusion of up to 10% FSCM in laying hen diets improved egg yolk lipid and fatty acid profiles, as well as egg quality and nutritional and metabolic indices."

      "abstract": "Lignan, a beneficial constituent of Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) showed great interest in researchers because of its multiple functional properties. Nonetheless, a challenge arises due to the glycosidic structure of lignans, which the gut epithelium cannot readily absorb. Therefore, we screened 18 strains of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Enterococcus durans to remove glycosides from flaxseed lignan extract enzymatically. Among our findings, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SCB0151 showed the highest activity of β-glucosidase (8.91 ± 0.04 U/mL) and higher transformed efficiency of Secoisolariciresinol (SECO) (8.21 ± 0.13%). The conversion rate of Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and the generation rate of SECO was 58.30 ± 3.78% and 32.13 ± 2.78%, respectively, under the optimized conditions. According to the LC-HRMSMS analysis, SECO (68.55 ± 6.57 µM), Ferulic acid (FA) (32.12 ± 2.50 µM), and Coumaric acid (CA) (79.60 ± 6.21 µM) were identified in the biotransformation products (TP) of flaxseed lignan extract. Results revealed that the TP exhibited a more pronounced anti-inflammatory effect than the flaxseed lignan extract. SECO, FA, and CA demonstrated a more inhibitory effect on NO than that of SDG. The expression of iNOS and COX-2 was significantly suppressed by TP treatment in LPS-induced Raw264.7 cells. The secretion of IL-6, IL-2, and IL-1β decreased by 87.09 ± 0.99%, 45.40 ± 0.87%, and 53.18 ± 0.83%, respectively, at 60 µg/mL of TP treatment. Given these data, the bioavailability of flaxseed lignan extract and its anti-inflammatory effect were significantly enhanced by Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SCB0151, which provided a novel approach to commercializing flaxseed lignan extract for functional food.",

      "abstract": "Flaxseed has been recognized as a superfood worldwide due to its abundance of diverse functional phytochemicals and nutrients. Various studies have shown that flaxseed consumption is beneficial to human health, though methods of processing flaxseed may significantly affect the absorption and metabolism of its bioactive components. Hence, flaxseed was subjected to various processing methods including microwaving treatment, microwave-coupled dry milling, microwave-coupled wet milling, and high-pressure homogenization. In vitro digestion experiments were conducted to assess the impact of these processing techniques on the potential gastrointestinal fate of flaxseed oil. Even though more lipids were released by the flaxseed at the beginning of digestion after it was microwaved and dry-milled, the full digestion of flaxseed oil was still restricted in the intestine. In contrast, oil droplets were more evenly distributed in wet-milled flaxseed milk, and there was a greater release of fatty acids during simulated digestion (7.33 ± 0.21 μmol/mL). Interestingly, wet-milled flaxseed milk showed higher oxidative stability compared with flaxseed powder during digestion despite the larger specific surface area of its oil droplets. This study might provide insight into the choice of flaxseed processing technology for better nutrient delivery efficiency."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study was designed to explore the effects of flaxseed oil on the metaphase II (MII) oocyte rates in women with decreased ovarian reserve (DOR). METHODS: The women with DOR were divided into a study group (n = 108, flaxseed oil treatment) and a control group (n = 110, no treatment). All patients were treated with assisted reproductive technology (ART). Subsequently, the ART stimulation cycle parameters, embryo transfer (ET) results, and clinical reproductive outcomes were recorded. The influencing factors affecting the MII oocyte rate were analyzed using univariate analysis and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Flaxseed oil reduced the recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) dosage and stimulation time and increased the peak estradiol (E2) concentration in DOR women during ART treatment. The MII oocyte rate, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, high-quality embryo rate, and blastocyst formation rate were increased after flaxseed oil intervention. The embryo implantation rate of the study group was higher than that of the control group (p = 0.05). Additionally, the female age [odds ratio (OR): 0.609, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52-0.72, p < 0.01] was the hindering factor of MII oocyte rate, while anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH; OR: 100, 95% CI: 20.31-495, p < 0.01), peak E2 concentration (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 1.00-1.00, p = 0.01), and the intake of flaxseed oil (OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.06-5.93, p = 0.04) were the promoting factors for MII oocyte rate. CONCLUSION: Flaxseed oil improved ovarian response and the quality of oocytes and embryos, thereby increasing the fertilization rate and high-quality embryo rate in DOR patients. The use of flaxseed oil was positively correlated with MII oocyte rate in women with DOR. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: https://www.chictr.org.cn/, identifier ChiCTR2300073785.",

Both obese male and female rats were studied along with their lean counterparts after 12 weeks of ingestion of a control diet, or control diet with flaxseed, or high fat, high sucrose (HFHS), or HFHS plus flaxseed. Obese rats showed higher liver weight and increased levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, and saturated fatty acid, which were further elevated in rats on the HFHS diet. The HFHS diet induced a significant two-fold elevation in the plasma levels of both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in the obese male and female rats. Including flaxseed in the HFHS diet significantly lowered liver weight, depressed the plasma levels of both enzymes in the obese male rats, and reduced hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride content as well as improving the fatty acid profile. In summary, including flaxseed in the diet of male and female obese rats led to an improved lipid composition in the liver and significantly reduced biomarkers of tissue injury despite consuming a HFHS chow.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease. Our previous research found flaxseed polysaccharide (FP) has an anti-obesity effect, and its anti-obesity effect possibly depends on Clostridium leptum (C. leptum). However, whether the strain takes the role and how it works is still being determined. Here, FP was fermented in vitro by C. leptum and its metabolites were analyzed. Subsequently, the FP fermentation broth of C. leptum (FPF) was given to the obese pseudo sterile rats. The results showed FPF was rich in various metabolites, among which the top ten in relative expression abundance were 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoate, 7,8-dihydro-3b,6a-dihydroxy-alpha-ionol 9-glucoside, Valyl-Serine, 2-amino-4-[(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropyl)amino]butanoic acid, Agavoside B, glycylproline, lycopersiconolide, armillaritin, Isoleucyl-Hydroxyproline and norethindrone acetate. After intervention with FPF, the weight, abdominal fat ratio, and total fat ratio of rats were significantly reduced and the lipid metabolism of them has been improved. This effect may be achieved by up regulating glucagon-like peptide-1 and adiponectin and further activating the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. This is the first experimental proof that FP exerts its anti-obesity effects through metabolites from C. leptum fermenting FP, not FP itself and the bacterial cells (debris) of C. leptum. It is also the first demonstration that FPF has a significant anti-obesity effect.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological drugs targeting specific pathways involved in various diseases have seen recent advancement with newer and more efficient emerging drug targets, but these drugs are limited in terms of their side effects and patient adherence. The potential of plant-based diets in the form of functional foods is increasingly being realized as an option to treat and/or prevent several diseases. In this work, we have selected flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum), also known as linseed, to study its pharmacological efficacy and proposed mechanisms of action for medicinal purposes. The target genes of linseed with Disease Specificity Index (DSI >0.6) are compared to the associated genes of diabetes mellitus, decrease in appetite, addictive behavior, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), and the selected genes are further evaluated using in silico methods. The binding affinity of flaxseed to three common target proteins (CCDC28b, PDCD6IP, and USP34) is assessed by docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results show that linseed is safe to use for mutagenic toxicity and other cardiotoxicity measures, but linseed is unsafe for embryotoxicity, hERG toxicity, and cardiac failure. The analysis of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways indicates that flaxseed can be used as a medicinal herb for treatment of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, IBDs, and PCOS."

A systematic search was performed using various online databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library, to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) until June 2023. To evaluate heterogeneity among the selected studies, the Q-test and I2 statistics were employed. Data were combined using either a fixed- or random-effects model and presented as a weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Of the 428 citations, six RCTs were included. The pooled results did not show significant changes in the WMD of lipid factors (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol) following flaxseed intake. However, after performing a sensitivity analysis to determine the source of heterogeneity, flaxseed supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in TG levels (WMD = -18.39 mg/dL; 95% CI: -35.02, -1.75). Moreover, no significant differences were observed in either weight or BMI following flaxseed intake. However, the circulating levels of fasting blood glucose (WMD = -8.35 mg/dL; 95% CI: -15.01, -1.69, p = .01) and hs-CRP (WMD = -1.35 mg/L; 95% CI: -1.93, -0.77, p < .01) significantly decreased after the intervention. Flaxseed supplementation was associated with lowering FBS, hs-CRP, and TG levels but did not affect weight loss parameters and other lipid markers in CAD.",

The Pickering emulsions stabilized with ultrasound-treated SPI nanoparticles showed smaller particle size, lower zeta potential, and improved emulsifying properties. Notably, at 450 W power, these emulsions showed a higher solid-liquid balance, reduced mean square displacement, backscattering fluctuations, and turbiscan stability index.

      "abstract": "Flaxseed meal (FSM) is a byproduct of flaxseed oil extraction which has rich nutritional value and can be used as a high-quality new protein ingredient. However, the anti-nutrient factor (ANF) in FSM restricts its potential application in feed. The strategy of microbial fermentation is a highly effective approach to reducing ANF in FSM and enhancing its feeding value. However, evaluation of the nutritional value of fermented flaxseed meal (FFSM) in growing pigs has not yet been conducted. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the nutritional value of FFSM in growing pigs and comparison of the effect of fermentation treatment on improving the nutritional value of FSM. Two experiments were conducted to determine the available energy value, apparent digestibility of nutrients, and standard ileal digestibility of amino acids of FSM and FFSM in growing pigs. The results showed as follows: (1) Fermentation treatment increased the levels of crude protein (CP), Ca and P in FSM by 2.86%, 9.54% and 4.56%, while decreasing the concentration of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) by 34.09% and 12.71%, respectively (p < 0.05); The degradation rate of CGs in FSM was 54.09% (p < 0.05); (2) The digestible energy (DE) and metabolic energy (ME) of FSM and FFSM were 14.54 MJ/kg, 16.68 MJ/kg and 12.85 MJ/kg, 15.24 MJ/kg, respectively; (3) Compared with FSM, dietary FFSM supplementation significantly increased the apparent digestibility of CP, NDF, ADF, Ca, and P of growing pigs (p < 0.05) and significantly increased the standard ileal digestibility of methionine (p < 0.05). These results indicate that fermentation treatment could effectively enhance the nutritional value of FSM and provide basic theoretical data for the application of FFSM in pig production."

      "abstract": "Flaxseed is an ancient commercial oil that historically has been used as a functional food to lower cholesterol levels. However, despite its longstanding treatment, there is currently a lack of scientific evidence to support its role in the management of cardiac remodeling. This study aimed to address this gap in knowledge by examining the molecular mechanism of standardized flaxseed oil in restoring cardiac remodeling in the heart toxicity vivo model. The oil fraction was purified, and the major components were standardized by qualitative and quantitative analysis. In vivo experimental design was conducted using isoproterenol ISO (85 mg/kg) twice subcutaneously within 24 h between each dose. The rats were treated with flaxseed oil fraction (100 mg/kg orally) and the same dose was used for omega 3 supplement as a positive control group. The GC-MS analysis revealed that α-linolenic acid (24.6%), oleic acid (10.5%), glycerol oleate (9.0%) and 2,3-dihydroxypropyl elaidate (7%) are the major components of oil fraction. Physicochemical analysis indicated that the acidity percentage, saponification, peroxide, and iodine values were 0.43, 188.57, 1.22, and 122.34 respectively. As compared with healthy control, ISO group-induced changes in functional cardiac parameters. After 28-day pretreatment with flaxseed oil, the results indicated an improvement in cardiac function, a decrease in apoptosis, and simultaneous prevention of myocardial fibrosis. The plasma levels of BNP, NT-pro-BNP, endothelin-1, Lp-PLA2, and MMP2, and cTnI and cTn were significantly diminished, while a higher plasma level of Topo 2B was observed. Additionally, miRNA - 1 and 29b were significantly downregulated. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanism of flaxseed oil in restoring cardiac remodeling and support its future application as a cardioprotective against heart diseases.",

      "abstract": "Flaxseed oil (FO) has been demonstrated its multiple beneficial effects in vivo due to high concentration of α-linolenic acid. The deterioration of FO can be triggered by high temperature heating during the deep frying process resulting in alteration of healthy properties. In this study, the effect of FO before and after deep frying on lipid metabolism and gut homeostasis of rats was investigated compared to deep-fried palm oil (DPO) treated group. Deep-fried flaxseed oil (DFO) treatment significantly enhanced the triglyceride accumulation in serum and liver tissues of rats. A greater increase of peroxides and proinflammatory cytokine levels was found in the serum of DFO treated rats compared to other groups. The histopathologic data indicated that DFO and DPO reduced the villus height of intestinal and colonic tissues and increased the inflammatory cell infiltration. The inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL-6) were enhanced and the key markers of epithelia colonic tissues (occludin and MUC-2) were suppressed in rats with DFO interventions, which is in consistency with histopathologic results. In addition, FO could increase the number of beneficial bacteria while the relative abundance of obesity and inflammatory-related bacteria was promoted by DFO treatment, including Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Selenomonadales. In conclusion, DFO intake had a significant impact on the disruption of gut barrier homeostasis, potentially worsening the dysbiosis than DPO. The beneficial effects of FO in vivo could be significantly reduced by extreme deep frying, which suggests the need for moderate cooking edible oils such as FO.",

      "abstract": "This research aimed to create Pickering emulsions using modified soy protein isolate (SPI) as a stabilizer and flaxseed-derived diglyceride (DAG) as an oil phase. The SPI was modified through a process involving both heating and ultrasound treatment. The result indicated that the droplet size of emulsions increased with the increase in oil content (p < 0.05). For instance, the largest droplet size (23 µm) was observed at an oil-to-SPI dispersion ratio of 4:1 ratio (φ = 80), whereas the smallest droplet size (6.39 µm) was noticed at the 1:4 ratio. During the 7-day storage period, the emulsions with a 4:1 ratio (φ = 80) showed the lowest droplet size increase (from 23 µm to 25.58 µm). In contrast, the emulsions with a 1:1 ratio displayed the highest increase (from 19.39 µm to 74.29 µm). Creaming index results revealed that emulsions with a 4:1 ratio (φ = 80) showed no signs of creaming and phase separation than all other treatments (p < 0.05). Backscattering fluctuations (ΔBS) and turbiscan stability index (TSI) showed that emulsions with 4:1, 2:1, and 1:1 oil-to-SPI dispersion ratios had consistent ΔBS curves with higher and TSI curves with lower values. Optical microscopy, confocal laser scanning, and cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed that emulsions with oil-to-SPI dispersion ratios of 4:1 and 2:1 had well-organized structures with no visible coalescence. Macromorphological and microrheological investigations demonstrated that emulsions with 80% oil content had the highest viscosity, both moduli, elasticity index, macroscopic viscosity index, and the lowest fluidity index and solid-liquid balance values. Moreover, these emulsions were more resistant to centrifugation and storage environments. In conclusion, the study determined that flaxseed-derived DAG-based high internal phase Pickering emulsions (φ = 80) had superior stability, improved viscoelasticity, and better rheological properties.",

      "abstract": "Camelina (Camelina sativa) is a hardy, low-input oilseed crop that provides a rich source of the n-3 fatty acid, α-linolenic acid (ALA). The primary purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of dietary camelina oil (CAM) consumption on various health parameters, as compared to horses fed canola oil (OLA) or flax oil (FLX). Secondly, to determine how dietary CAM, FLX, and OLA alter circulating plasma total lipids across time. Thirty horses, from three separate herds, were used for this study [14.9 years ± 5.3 years; 544 ± 66 kg calculated BW (mean ± SD)]. After a 4-week gradual acclimation period using sunflower oil mixed with soaked hay cubes, horses were balanced by location, age, sex, weight, and breed and randomly allocated to one of three treatment oils (CAM, OLA, or FLX) at an inclusion of 370 mg of oil/kg BW/day. Horses had ad libitum access to hay and/or pasture for the duration of the study. Body condition score (BCS), BW, oil intake, complete blood counts, plasma biochemical profiles, and plasma total lipids were measured on weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 throughout the 16-week treatment period. BW, BCS, and oil intake were analyzed using an ANOVA using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS Studio. Complete blood counts and biochemical profiles were analyzed using an ANCOVA, and fatty acids were analyzed using an ANOVA in PROC MIXED in SAS Studio. No differences were observed among treatment groups for BW, BCS, oil intake, complete blood counts, and biochemical parameters. Individual fatty acids that differed among treatments and/or across time were largely reflective of the different FA profiles of the oils provided. Most notably, plasma ALA was greater for FLX than OLA, but neither differed from CAM (P = 0.01). Linoleic acid did not differ among treatments or over time (P > 0.05). The n-6:n-3 ratio decreased over time for both CAM and FLX, and ratios were lower for FLX than OLA at week 16, but not different from CAM (P = 0.02). These results suggest that dietary CAM had no adverse effects on health parameters and that daily supplementation of CAM and FLX at 370 mg of oil/kg BW/day induces positive changes (a decrease) in the n-6:n-3 status of the horse. Consequently, CAM may be considered as an alternative oil to FLX in equine diets.",

Importantly, there is recognition that pubertal processes and lifestyle, including diet, are important for breast health throughout life. Mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Our research uncovers a link between mammary gland miRNA expression and the gut microbiota in young female mice. We found that this relationship is modifiable via a dietary intervention. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we also show that the expression of miRNAs involved in these relationships is altered in breast cancer in humans. These findings highlight a role for the gut microbiome as a modulator, and thus a target, of interventions aiming at reducing breast cancer risk.

The physiochemical features of magnetic flaxseed mucilage hydrogel/SF nanobiocomposite are evaluated by FT-IR, EDX, FE-SEM, TEM, XRD, VSM, and TG technical analyses. In addition to chemical characterization, given its natural-based composition, the in-vitro cytotoxicity and hemolysis assays are studied and the results are considerable. Following the use of highest concentration of magnetic flaxseed mucilage hydrogel/SF nanobiocomposite (1.75 mg/mL) and the cell viability percentage of two different cell lines including normal HEK293T cells (95.73%, 96.19%) and breast cancer BT549 cells (87.32%, 86.9%) in 2 and 3 days, it can be inferred that this magnetic nanobiocomposite is biocompatible with HEK293T cells and can inhibit the growth of BT549 cell lines. Besides, observing less than 5% of hemolytic effect can confirm its hemocompatibility. Furthermore, the high specific absorption rate value (107.8 W/g) at 200 kHz is generated by a determined concentration of this nanobiocomposite (1 mg/mL). According to these biological assays, this magnetic responsive cytocompatible composite can be contemplated as a high-potent substrate for further biomedical applications like magnetic hyperthermia treatment and tissue engineering.",

      "abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of flaxseed oil or flaxseed grain on the intestinal microbiota and blood fatty acid profiles of Albas cashmere goats. Sixty kid goats were allocated to three treatments and fed for 90 days with a control treatment, comprising a basal diet (CON, total-mixed ration with flaxseed meal), or experimental treatments, comprising a basal diet with added flaxseed oil (LNO) and a basal diet with added heated flaxseed grain (HLS). On day 90, two goats were randomly selected from each pen (eight goats per treatment) for euthanizing; then, five of the eight goats were randomly selected, and we collected their intestinal (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon) digesta for analysis of the bacteria community. The results indicated that Firmicutes are the most predominant phylum in different segments of the intestinal digesta. Compared with the CON group, the relative abundance of duodenal Firmicutes, jejunal Saccharibacteria, and Verrucomicrobia significantly decreased in the LNO and HLS groups (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the LNO and HLS groups. Compared with the CON and HLS groups, the RA of duodenal and jejunal Proteobacteria remarkably increased in the LNO group (p < 0.05), and there was no significant difference between the CON and HLS groups. Compared with the CON and LNO groups, the RA of Actinobacteria remarkably increased in the small intestine of the HLS group (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the CON and LNO groups in the duodenum and ileum. The results of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that the HLS group was characterized by a higher RA of the [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group in the small intestine and the LNO group was represented by a higher RA of the Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group in the cecum and colon, while the CON group was represented by a higher RA of Solobacterium, Pseudoramibacter, and Acetitomaculum in the small intestine and a higher RA of norank_o__Bradymonadales, the Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group, and Ruminiclostridium_1 in the cecum and colon. In conclusion, the addition of flaxseed oil and grain rich in c18:3n3 to the diet could reduce the microbial diversity of the small intestinal segments and the microbial diversity and richness of the cecum and colon in Albas cashmere goats. And flaxseed grain is more efficient than flaxseed oil in protecting intestinal health and promoting the absorption of c18:3n3."

      "abstract": "Flaxseed is becoming increasingly popular as a superfood due to its many health benefits. While flaxseed is considered an oilseed, flaxseed meal (the by-product of flaxseed oil extraction) also contains many nutritional compounds not found in the oil. This study explored the use of a Canadian flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) meal product to fortify bakery foods and improve their nutritional properties. Muffins were made using a control recipe as well as four different formulations that included varying amounts of a standardized flaxseed meal supplement called XanFlax (5, 10, 20, and 40%). The physicochemical properties of the muffins, including their texture, color, sugar content, pH, specific gravity, loss rate, and moisture, were evaluated. Additionally, the sensory attributes contributing to muffin quality were thoroughly examined. The lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) of the muffins, which were highest in the control group at 82.22 and 34.69, respectively, decreased as the amount of XanFlax increased (p < 0.05). Additionally, the redness (a*) of the muffins increased as the amount of XanFlax increased (p < 0.05). The muffins' sugar content (2.00 brix%) remained consistent across all treatments and controls except for those prepared with 20% XanFlax (2.17 brix%). As the amount of XanFlax powder increased, the pH of the muffins increased significantly. The moisture content in the muffins was highest at 23.71 ± 0.79% in the 10% XanFlax treatment and lowest at 22.06 ± 0.30% in the 40% XanFlax treatment. The muffins enriched with 5% XanFlax had an average height of 5.35 cm and volume of 131.33 mL, surpassing the results for the muffins made with other formulas (p < 0.05). Additionally, the cohesiveness and gumminess of the muffins tended to increase with the addition of XanFlax. The most favorable attributes, namely the appearance, flavor, taste, texture, and overall acceptance, were consistently associated with the 5% and 10% XanFlax treatments (p < 0.05). This study marks the first time a standardized flaxseed gum product, XanFlax, has been described in a functional baking application."

      "abstract": "Flaxseed has been recognized as a valuable source of nutrients and bioactive compounds, including proteins that possess various health benefits. In recent years, studies have shown that flaxseed proteins, including albumins, globulins, glutelin, and prolamins, possess anti-cancer properties. These properties are attributed to their ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and interfere with cancer cell signaling pathways, ultimately leading to the inhibition of metastasis. Moreover, flaxseed proteins have been reported to modulate cancer cell mechanobiology, leading to changes in cell behavior and reduced cancer cell migration and invasion. This review provides an overview of the anti-cancer properties of flaxseed proteins, with a focus on their potential use in cancer treatment. Additionally, it highlights the need for further research to fully establish the potential of flaxseed proteins in cancer therapy."

      "abstract": "Hyperammonemia is characterized by the excessive accumulation of ammonia in the body as a result of the loss of liver detoxification, leading to the development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). These metabolic alterations carry cognitive and motor deficits and cause neuronal damage, with no effective treatment at present. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of two subacute oral administrations of flaxseed oil (0.26 and 0.52 mL/kg) on short- and long-term memory, visuospatial memory, locomotor activity, motor coordination, and the neuronal morphology of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) via tests on Wistar rats with hyperammonemia. The goal was to identify its role in the regulation of cerebral edema, without liver damage causing cerebral failure. In contrast with an ammonium-rich diet, flaxseed oil and normal foods did not cause cognitive impairment or motor alterations, as evidenced in the short-term and visuospatial memory tests. Furthermore, the flaxseed oil treatment maintained a regular neuronal morphology of the prefrontal cortex, which represents a neuroprotective effect. We conclude that the oral administration of flaxseed oil prevents cognitive and motor impairments as well as neuronal alterations in rats with hyperammonemia, which supports the potential use of this oil to ameliorate the changes that occur in hepatic encephalopathy.",

      "abstract": "Camelina oil is derived from a low-input, high-yield crop and, in comparison to many other dietary fat sources currently used in equine diets, provides a greater amount of α-linolenic acid [ALA; (n-3)], than linoleic acid [LA; (n-6)]. However, no research exists assessing the effects of feeding camelina oil to horses in contrast to other commonly used oils. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of supplementing camelina oil to that of flaxseed and canola oil supplementation, on outcomes related to skin and coat health in horses. Thirty adult horses [23 mares, 7 geldings; 14.9 years ± 5.3 years; 544 ± 66 kg body weight (BW) (mean ± SD)] underwent a 4-week wash-in period consuming hay and sunflower oil. Following the wash-in period, horses were blocked by location, age, and BW, and assigned to one of three treatment oils for 16 weeks (370 mg oil/kg BW): camelina (CAM), canola (OLA), or flaxseed (FLX) oil. Blood samples were collected and plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; ELISA), nitric oxide (NO; Griess Reaction), and glycosaminoglycan (GAG; DMMB) concentrations were measured on weeks 0 (n = 30), 14 (n = 24), and 16 (n = 30). On weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured pre- and post-acetone application using a VapoMeter (n = 26), and a 5-point-Likert scale was used to assess skin and coat characteristics on the side and rump of the horses (n = 30). All data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. Independent of treatment, coat color, and quality increased from baseline. There were no differences in the outcomes assessed between the horses supplemented camelina oil and those supplemented canola or flaxseed oil. These results suggest that independent of treatment, all oil supplements improved coat color and quality in horses. This provides indication that camelina oil is comparable to existing plant-based oil supplements in supporting skin and coat health and inflammation in horses.",

Therefore, the present meta-analysis was conducted to provide definite and conclusive results. METHODS: Systematically, Scopus, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science databases, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant literature published up to December 2022. Based on random-effect models, standard mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for net changes in adipokine concentrations. RESULTS: Overall, 13 RCTs (15 arms) were eligible to be included. The results indicated that leptin was significantly reduced after the intervention with flaxseed supplement (SMD = -0.69, 95% CI: -1.37, -0.01; p = 0.048; I2 = 92.0%, p < 0.001). In addition, flaxseed supplements had no considerable effect on plasma adiponectin (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI: -0.20, 1.25, p = 0.159; I2 = 92.0%, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Flaxseed significantly improves leptin but does not affect adiponectin concentrations. Additional future well-designed trials are required to further assess the potential benefits of flaxseed on adipokines in humans."

      "abstract": "The existing treatise targeted to compare the effects of adding different nano-emulsions essential oils (olive, flaxseed, and grapeseed oils) in freezing extender on semen quality and freezability in buffalo. Nano-emulsions were prepared from olive, flaxseed, and grapeseed oils and characterized for their sizes and shapes. Semen extended in four tubes were supplemented with 0 (control) and 3.5% nanoemulsion oils, including olive (NEO), flaxseed (NEFO) and grape seed oils (NEGSO) respectively. NEGSO resulted in the highest (p < 0.05) membrane integrity, vitality, progressive motility (P-motility) of sperm compared to the other groups in post-thawed buffalo bull semen (at 37 °C for 30 s). The addition of NEGSO had the best results for membrane integrity, progressive motility, and vitality of sperm after incubation (at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 h). A superior (p < 0.05) value of total antioxidant capacity in frozen-thawed spermatozoa was monitored in all supplemented groups as relative to the control. The values of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) were lower (p < 0.05) in NEGSO group compared with other groups. Both NEO and NEFO exhibited the same results for MDA, and NO levels (p > 0.05). All supplemented groups exhibited lower hydrogen peroxide levels (p < 0.05) as relative to the un-treated group. The lowest (p < 0.05) caspase 3 levels were verified in NEGSO treatment, followed by NEFO and NEO treatments. Post-thawed sperm showed ultrastructural damages in the control group, and theses damages were attenuated or resorted by the NEGSO, NEFO and NEO supplemented to freezing extender. In consequences with in vitro results regarding the sperm attribute, a greater pregnancy rate (92%) was observed in NEGSO group as compared with NEFO (88%), NEO (76%) and CON (68%) groups. Our findings demonstrate that NEGSO (3.5%) could be used as a new strategy in enhancing sperm functionality, potential fertility and reducing the oxidative damage and apoptosis markers. This could be significantly applicable for sperm physiology cryopreservation in the milieu of assisted reproduction systems.",

Ninety-six one-day-old Ross 308 broiler chicken males were randomly assigned to four groups (six replicates per treatment, four birds per cage, n = 24 per group): Group RO received diets containing rapeseed oil (RO) and group FLO received diets containing flaxseed oil (FLO); Group RO_Q and group FLO_Q received these same diets containing RO or FLO oils, supplemented with optimized quercetin (Q). Blood, pectoral muscles, and liver samples of chickens were collected after 35 days to determine: (1) the global indicators of antioxidant capacity: ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), antiradical activity (DPPH·/ABTS·+), total antioxidant status (TAS), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px); (2) the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); and (3) the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Data showed that the FLO diet did not affect the final performance parameters in relation to RO, but the optimized Q tended to improve the total body weight gain and the final body weight of broiler chickens (P = 0.10). The antioxidant traces analyzed in the blood (GSH-Px), plasma (FRAP, ABTS·+, DPPH·, TAS), serum (DPPH·), and pectoral muscles (SOD, CAT) of chickens were not altered by either Oil or Q factor. FLO supplementation increased MDA content in the liver of chickens (P < 0.05) and increased liver CAT activity, which was not improved by optimized Q. Meanwhile, the Oil × Q interaction suggests that optimized Q could reduce the liver burden and negative effects of oxidized lipid by-products associated with FLO diets. Our results indicate that optimizing the addition of natural polyphenols to feed may be a valuable alternative to the application of polyphenolic antioxidants in animal nutrition, allowing for an economical use of the antioxidant additives when customized to the peroxidability of fat sources, which is line to the conception of sustainable development covering 'The European Green Deal' and 'Farm to Fork Strategy'.",

      "abstract": "Over millennia, flaxseeds and fennel seeds have captured greater attention owing to the broad spectrum of bioactive compounds and their respective therapeutic potential. They are well-known therapeutic plants, frequently used in home treatments for a variety of medical conditions. The novelty of this pilot study is to assess the beneficial health effects of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and anethole-based enriched cookies among hyperlipidemic patients. The result of sensory evaluation revealed that cookies with anethole and SDG (500 + 500 mg/day) were significantly acceptable in terms of color, texture, taste, and overall acceptability same as that of control. This study was performed among 34 patients with hyperlipidemia in a university-affiliated hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. In this study, patients received dietary supplementation with anethole and SDG (500 + 500 mg/day) administered in cookies for 8 weeks. Patients were assigned into two groups, intervention (receiving anethole + SDG-enriched cookies; n = 16) and placebo (n = 18), for 8 weeks. Both groups maintained the same diet and lifestyle. Pre- and postintervention weight, lipid profile, and liver enzyme levels were measured. Analysis of covariance and paired sample t-test were used for comparing the two groups. After 8 weeks, a significant mean weight loss was observed in the intervention group (4.26%) as compared to the placebo group (0.3%). A significant reduction of TC (177.02 ± 5.14 mg/dL; p = .024), TG (150.19 ± 7.94 mg/dL; p = .032), and LDL (87.38 ± 3.58 mg/dL; p = .001) were compared to the control group and HDL level (57.09 ± 3.90 mg/dL; p = .035) were increased in the intervention group as compared to the placebo. Meanwhile, it had a minor improvement in AST (30.97 ± 2.95 U/L; p = .01), ALT (33.05 ± 1.52 U/L; p = .025), and ALP (112.15 ± 4.03 U/L; p = .03) among the intervention group. Thus, based on the results from the study, it can be said that anethole + SDG-enriched bakery products could be developed as a functional dietary option for hyperlipidemia in developing countries like Pakistan."

      "abstract": "Flaxseed and lupin seed were offered as an alternative dietary approach in dairy cows, through the partial substitution of soybean meal. Milk production and fertility traits were investigated. A total of 330 animals were allocated into two groups, treated (n = 176) and control (n = 154). From each group, 30 animals were selected for hematological and cytological studies. The experimental feeding period lasted for 81 days (25 days prepartum and 56 days postpartum). The control ration (group C) contained corn, barley, soybean meal, rapeseed cake, corn silage and lucerne hay; whereas, in the treatment group (group T), 50% of the soybean meal was replaced by an equal mixture of flaxseed and lupins. The two rations were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isoenergetic. Milk samples were analyzed for chemical composition, somatic cell count (SCC) content and total colony forming units (CFU). Blood samples were collected, and serum was analyzed for non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), acute phase proteins (haptoglobin and serum amyloid) and lipid oxidation indices, namely thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and catalase activity. To assess polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) numbers, endometrial samples from each cow were collected on days 21 and 42. No difference was recorded between groups in milk yield (p > 0.05). In multiparous cows, NEFA (mMol/L) concentrations were significantly lower in group T than in group C on day 14 (p > 0.009) and on day 42 (p = 0.05), while no difference was detected in the group of primiparous cows. At all time points, serum TBARS and catalase values were similar in both groups (p > 0.05). Multiparous cows in group T expressed the first postpartum estrus and conceived earlier than cows in group C (p ≤ 0.05). Between days 21 to 42 postpartum, the PMN reduction rate was higher in group T animals (p ≤ 0.05). Acute phase protein levels were in general lower in group T animals, and at specific time points differed significantly from group C (p ≤ 0.05). It was concluded that the partial replacement of soybean meal by flaxseed and lupins had no negative effect on milk yield or milk composition, and improved cow fertility; which, along with the lower cost of flaxseed and lupins mixture, may increase milk production profitability."

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of olive oil and flaxseed consumption as part of a healthy diet on endothelial function, plasma inflammatory factors, and lipid profile in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). METHOD: This randomized nonblinded trial was performed on CHD patients. In the control group, participants received general heart-healthy dietary recommendations while in the intervention group, in addition to these recommendations, the participants consumed 25 ml of olive oil and 30 g of flaxseeds daily for 3 months. At baseline and after 3 months, changes in brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), plasma asymmetric dimethyl arginine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and lipids and lipoproteins were measured. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients finished the trial ( n  = 24 in the intervention and n  = 26 in the control groups). Compared to the control group, consumption of flaxseed and olive oil significantly improved brachial artery FMD%, and reduced plasma IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, total cholesterol, and tended to reduce hs-CRP, and non-HDL-cholesterol but the concentration of other study indices were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of olive oil and flaxseed in the diet of CHD patients may contribute to secondary prevention by improving endothelial function and plasma inflammatory factors.",

For efficacy studies, 90 women with PCOS, between 15 and 40 years were selected from the department of gynecology, Tertiary care unit. Women with PCOS were divided into three groups (T0, T1, T2) (20 women/group). Among these three groups, the first was the control group (T0). The second group was the experimental group (T1). In T1, 20 women with PCOS were treated with a portion control diet and METFORMIN 500 mg tab/day for 90 days. The third group was also an experimental group (T2). In this group, 20 women with PCOS were also treated with another treatment plan for 90 days, in which portion control diet and seed cycling were included. During the 12-week efficacy trial, the highest follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were found in the control group T0 (8.18 ± 0.13 mIU/mL). In T2, FSH falls from 6.545 ± 0.16 mIU/mL to 3.51 ± 0.13 mIU/mL throughout a 12-week period. Overall, a portion-controlled diet and seed cycling reduced FSH levels by 1.2% to 2.5%. LH value was 10.118 ± 0.1874 IU/L in the control group (T0), which climbed 12.82 ± 0.15 IU/L, but decreased from 10.62 ± 0.26 IU/L to 9.79 ± 0.17 U/L and 11.015 ± 0.24 IU/L 6.217 ± 0.167 IU/L in the other groups (T1, T2). It was determined that the LH levels were reduced by 1.5%-2% in T2. Conclusively, the seed cycling approach is effective and has significant results in women with PCOS. Seed cycling improves hormonal disturbance in women which promotes a healthy life."

No definitive treatment for NAFLD has been identified yet. The aim was to determine the effect of atorvastatin (ATO) and flaxseed on related indicators of NAFLD-induced fat/fructose-enriched diet (FFD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups. NAFLD groups received FFD and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) to induce NAFLD. After intervention with ATO (10 mg/kg/day) and/or flaxseed (7.5 g/kg/day), liver enzymes and lipid profiles in serum were determined at eight week of interventions. RESULTS: Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol (CHO) in FFD + ATO, FFD + flaxseed, and FFD + ATO + flaxseed had a significant decrease and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level and LDL/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio showed a significant increase in the FFD + flaxseed compared to the FFD. The levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) were significantly reduced in the FFD + ATO, FFD + flaxseed, and the FFD + ATO + flaxseed. In addition, Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were significantly different between normal and FFD. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels were significantly different in the FFD + flaxseed and the FFD + ATO + flaxseed compared to the FFD. CONCLUSION: ATO therapy along with flaxseed controls NAFLD-related indices and FBS. Therefore, it can be stated with caution that ATO and flaxseed can be used to improve lipid profile and reduce the complications of NAFLD."

Flaxseed was subjected to moisture adjustment (30-35 wt%, 24 h), and microwave exposure (0-5 min, 700  W). Microwave treatment slightly weakened the physical stability of flaxseed milk indicated by Turbiscan Stability Index, but there were no visual phase separation during 21 days of storage at 4 °C. Upon microwave treatment, OBs experienced the layer-by-layer encapsulation into loose interface embedding by storage protein-gum polysaccharide complex from bulk phase, resulting in lower viscoelasticity of flaxseed milk. The OBs underwent earlier interface collapse and lipolysis during gastrointestinal digestion, followed by synergistic micellar absorption, faster chylomicrons transport within enterocytes of rats fed flaxseed milk. The accumulation of α-linolenic acid and synergistic conversion into docosapentaenoic and docosahexanoic acids in jejunum tissue were achieved accompanied by the interface remodeling of OBs in flaxseed milk.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of flaxseed in the diet may have a great number of potential benefits for the well-being of both healthy individuals and those challenged by disease conditions as well. With an increase in the number and quality of studies focused on the physiological and pathophysiological effects of dietary flaxseed, our knowledge concerning the rationale for the inclusion of flaxseed in our diet has become more convincing and stronger. The purpose of this review is threefold. First, the review will comprehensively document the evidence supporting the value of dietary flaxseed to improve bodily health in both normal and disease conditions. Second, this review will identify the mechanisms of action responsible for these effects. Finally, this article will review practical aspects relevant to the inclusion of flaxseed in the diet. Briefly, supplementing the diet with flaxseed has beneficial effects on the treatment and/or prevention of different kinds of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarcts, atherosclerosis), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, breast cancer, bone strength, menopause, diabetes, and wound healing. Although some controversy exists on the component within flaxseed that provides these beneficial actions, it is likely that the rich content of the omega-3 fatty acid, alpha linolenic acid, is primarily responsible for the majority of these biological effects. It is concluded that the constantly expanding evidence in support of the inclusion of flaxseed in our daily diet to provide significant health benefits strongly encourages the initiation of additional work on dietary flaxseed in order to both confirm past findings as well as to further advance our knowledge regarding the important biological actions of dietary flaxseed."

Knowledge as to whether the type and concentrations of α-linolenic acid (ALA) and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the diet can make a difference to the birds' immune responses when subjected to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge is limited. OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to determine the potential nutritional and health benefits to laying hens when receiving dietary omega-3 PUFA from either ALA or DHA. METHODS: A total of 80 Lohmann LSL-Classic (white egg layer, 20 wk old) were randomly assigned to 1 of 8 treatment diets (10 hens/treatment), provided 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, or 0.8% of total dietary omega-3 PUFA, provided as either ALA-rich flaxseed oil or DHA-enriched algal biomass. After an 8-wk feeding period, the birds were challenged with Escherichia coli-derived LPS (8 mg/kg; i.v. injection), with terminal sample collection 4 h after challenge. Egg yolk, plasma, liver, and spleen samples were collected for subsequent analyses. RESULTS: Increasing dietary omega-3 supplementation yielded predictable responses in egg yolk, plasma, and liver fatty acid concentrations. Dietary intake of ALA contributed mainly to ALA-derived oxylipins. Meanwhile, eicosapentaenoic acid- and DHA-derived oxylipins were primarily influenced by DHA dietary intake. LPS increased the concentrations of almost all the omega-6 PUFA-, ALA-, and DHA-derived oxylipins in plasma and decreased hepatic mRNA expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX (P < 0.001) involved in the biosynthesis of oxylipins. LPS also increased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ and receptor TLR-4 (P < 0.001) in the spleen. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that dietary intake of ALA and DHA had unique impacts on fatty acid deposition and their derived oxylipins and inflammatory responses under the administration of LPS in laying hens.",

Flaxseed powder (FLA) is rich in α-linolenic acid, dietary fiber, lignans, and other active ingredients, which have lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we investigated whether the FLA improves host metabolism by gut bacteria modulation and further bile acid modulation in mice fed a high-fat diet. At the end of the experiment, we found that FLA can significantly reduce the body weight, body fat content, and serum TG, LDL-C, and TNF-α levels of mice, and improve liver steatosis. FLA intervention has a significant effect on preventing and regulating the gut flora disturbance caused by HFD. FLA intervention affects bile acid metabolism in the intestine and causes significant changes in functional bile acids, which can play a lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory role by activating the intestinal Fxr- Fgfr4-Cyp7a1 and Tgr5-Tlr4-Tnfα pathways.",

Eight-hundred-and-forty rainbow trout individuals (mean weight: 25.66 ± 1.33 g) were fed with different doses of FSO (0.5, 1, and 1.5%) ad libitum two times a day for 9 weeks. At the end of the feeding, growth performance was evaluated and the fish were challenged with two different bacteria (Yersinia ruckeri and Aeromonas hydrophila). At the end of the 3rd, 6th, and 9th weeks, blood and tissue samples were taken from 9 fish per treatment to evaluate innate immune response, cytokine gene expression levels, antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation levels, and digestive enzyme activities. Determination of haematological parameters and histological examination was also carried out to evaluate the general health status of the fish. Results showed that the final weight and specific growth rate of FSO-supplemented fish increased significantly (p < 0.05). FSO-supplemented fish showed higher resistance to Y. ruckeri than the control group (p < 0.05). However, survival rates of all groups in A. hydrophila challenge test were similar (p > 0.05). Among the investigated innate immune response parameters, the potential killing activity of phagocytes, myeloperoxidase activity, and lysozyme activity increased in the FSO-supplemented groups (p < 0.05). Almost all cytokine gene expression levels in the experimental groups up-regulated especially after 9 weeks of feeding in the head kidney and intestine (p < 0.05). Similarly, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were found to be significantly higher in the FSO group than in the control (p < 0.05) whereas, the lipid peroxidation levels drastically declined as a result of the FSO supplementation (p < 0.05). These results suggest that FSO can improve growth, enhance immune response, and lower oxidative damage in rainbow trout when supplemented at the rates of 0.5-1.5% for 9 weeks.",

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases affecting people of all ages. Adipokines secreted from adipose tissue have been shown to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of UC. METHODS: This trial is an open-labeled randomized controlled trial conducted on 70 patients with UC. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: flaxseed and control. The patients in the intervention received 30 g/day flaxseed powder for 12 weeks. Patients' anthropometric, nutritional, and biochemical factors were evaluated at the beginning and end of the intervention period. RESULTS: Totally, 64 patients (36 men and 28 women) with a mean age of 31.12±9.67 were included in the final analysis. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding baseline weight and height (P>0.05). After the 12-week intervention, flaxseed supplementation led to a significant reduction in the resistin (-4.85±1.89 vs. -1.10±2.25, P<0.001) and visfatin concentration (-1.33±1.14 vs. -0.53±1.63, P=0.018). Further, we found a significant increase in the adiponectin levels after the GF supplementation (3.49±1.29 vs. -0.35±0.96, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Flaxseed supplementation could exert beneficial effects on adipokine levels in patients with UC."

The anti-obesity effects of flaxseed cake insoluble dietary fiber (FIDF), flaxseed cake soluble dietary fiber (FSDF), and FIDF combined with FSDF in diet-induced obese mice were investigated in our study. Supplementation with FSDF alone or FIDF and FSDF together lowered the fat accumulation, improved the serum lipid profile, increased the basal metabolism, and improved the gut microbiota of obese mice. Supplementation with FIDF and FSDF together significantly enriched the abundance of g_Akkermansia and g_Bifidobacterium, which are negatively associated with obesity. Supplementation with FIDF alone improved the liver lipid profile, raised the basal metabolism, and enhanced the short-chain fatty acid levels in the guts of the mice. In conclusion, our results collectively support the therapeutic potential of FIDF and FSDF in obesity treatment and indicate that FIDF and FSDF play different roles in the process of obesity treatment. Furthermore, our results provide critical information for flaxseed cake resource exploitation.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the seasonal variations in semen quality, testosterone levels, and scrotal size, following dietary flaxseed oil and ascorbic acid in South African indigenous rams. A total of 22 South African indigenous rams were randomly distributed into five treatment diets from June 2021 to May 2022 (12 months). To allow for the spermatogenesis period, semen was collected after sixty days of dietary supplementation with treatment diets. Blood was collected twice a week using an 18-gauge needle and vacutainer tubes and sent to the laboratory for testosterone analysis. Semen and blood collection were repeated eight times each season. The scrotal size (circumference, length, and width) was measured using a flexible measuring tape. Data was subjected to the General Linear Model (GLM) in Minitab® 2017. Treatment means were separated using Fisher's t-test and considered significantly different when the p-value was less than 0.05. Seasons and diet had an effect on progression, total motility, and testosterone levels. For instance, NC during the spring season had the lowest progressive motility (42.84 ± 5.32), followed by the summer (49.38 ± 4.49), winter (62.46 ± 4.35), and autumn (63.26 ± 3.58). Notably, when treatment diets were introduced, improvements were realized, and there were significant differences (p < 0.05) among the seasons following supplementation of FLAX, ASCA, and FLAX + ASCA, except for FLAX in the autumn season (53.83 ± 4.16). Total motility did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between the seasons when the NC and PC diets were supplemented; nevertheless, there was an improvement when FLAX, ASCA, and FLAX + ASCA were supplemented. Testosterone levels were significantly influenced by the seasons when negative and PC diets were supplemented. It is noteworthy that supplementing FLAX + ASCA can reverse the influence of the season on the testosterone levels (spring, 27.52 ± 4.42; summer, 20.23 ± 5.11; autumn, 25.24 ± 3.96; and winter, 25.92 ± 4.42). In conclusion, seasons do affect semen quality and testosterone levels of South African indigenous rams. However, flaxseed oil and ascorbic acid can reverse the seasonal variations in semen quality and testosterone levels."

      "abstract": "The effects of docosahexaenoic acid supplements on cognitive function have long been demonstrated, but the effects of alpha-linolenic acid, a precursor of docosahexaenoic acid, have not been fully tested. The search for functional foods that delay cognitive decline in the older adults is considered a very important area from a preventive perspective. The aim of this study was to conduct an exploratory evaluation of alpha-linolenic acid on various cognitive functions in healthy older subjects. Sixty healthy older adults aged 65 to 80 years, living in Miyagi prefecture, without cognitive impairment or depression, were included in the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Study subjects were randomly divided into two groups and received either 3.7 g/day of flaxseed oil containing 2.2 g of alpha-linolenic acid, or an isocaloric placebo (corn oil) containing 0.04 g of alpha-linolenic acid for 12 weeks. The primary endpoints were six cognitive functions closely related to everyday life: attention and concentration, executive function, perceptual reasoning, working memory, processing speed and memory function. After 12 weeks of intake, changes in verbal fluency scores on the frontal assessment battery at bedside, a neuropsychological test assessing executive function, in which participants are asked to answer as many words as possible in Japanese, were significantly greater in the intervention group (0.30 ± 0.53) than in the control group (0.03 ± 0.49, p < 0.05). All other cognitive test scores were not significantly different between the groups. In conclusion, daily consumption of flaxseed oil containing 2.2 g alpha-linolenic acid improved cognitive function, specifically verbal fluency, despite the age-related decline, in healthy individuals with no cognitive abnormalities. Further validation studies focusing on the effects of alpha-linolenic acid on verbal fluency and executive function in older adults are needed, as verbal fluency is a predictor of Alzheimer's disease development, important for cognitive health.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Camelina oil contains a greater concentration of omega-3 (n-3) a-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3; ALA) than omega-6 (n-6) linoleic acid (C18:2n-6; LA), in comparison to alternative fat sources commonly used to formulate canine diets. Omega-3 FAs are frequently used to support canine skin and coat health claims and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress; however, there is a lack of research investigating camelina oil supplementation and its effects on these applications in dogs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of camelina oil supplementation on coat quality, skin barrier function, and circulating inflammatory and oxidative marker concentrations. METHODS: Thirty healthy [17 females; 13 males; 7.2 ± 3.1 years old; 27.4 ± 14.0 kg body weight (BW)] privately-owned dogs of various breeds were used. After a 4-week wash-in period consuming sunflower oil (n6:n3 = 1:0) and a commercial kibble, dogs were blocked by age, breed, and size, and randomly assigned to one of three treatment oils: camelina (n6:n3 = 1:1.18), canola (n6:n3 = 1:0.59), flaxseed (n6:n3 = 1:4.19) (inclusion level: 8.2 g oil/100 g of total food intake) in a randomized complete block design. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured using a VapoMeter on the pinna, paw pad, and inner leg. Fasted blood samples were collected to measure serum inflammatory and oxidative marker concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and spectrophotometric assays. A 5-point-Likert scale was used to assess coat characteristics. All data were collected on weeks 0, 2, 4, 10, and 16 and analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. RESULTS: No significant changes occurred in TEWL, or inflammatory and oxidative marker concentrations among treatments, across weeks, or for treatment by week interactions. Softness, shine, softness uniformity, color intensity, and follicle density of the coat increased from baseline in all treatment groups (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Outcomes did not differ (P > 0.05) among treatment groups over 16-weeks, indicating that camelina oil is comparable to existing plant-based canine oil supplements, flaxseed, and canola, at supporting skin and coat health and inflammation in dogs. Future research employing an immune or exercise challenge is warranted, as the dogs in this study were not subjected to either."

      "abstract": "Ferulic acid (FA) is a naturally occurring phenolic antioxidant that is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries due to its low toxicity. Its derivatives also find numerous industrial applications and may have even higher biological activity than ferulic acid. In this study, the effect of the addition of FA and its derivatives-including vanillic acid (VA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and 4-vinylguaiacol (4-VG)-on the oxidative stability of cold-pressed flaxseed oil and the degradation of bioactive compounds during oxidation was investigated. The results showed that FA and its derivatives affected the oxidative stability of flaxseed oil, but their antioxidant activity depended on the concentration (25-200 mg/100 g oil) and temperature of treatment (60-110 °C). Based on Rancimat test results, flaxseed oil oxidative stability predicted at 20 °C increased linearly with ferulic acid concentration, while its derivatives effectively prolonged the induction time at lower concentrations (50-100 mg/100 g oil). The addition of phenolic antioxidants (80 mg/100 g) generally showed a protective effect against polyunsaturated fatty acids (DHFA and 4-VG), sterols (4-VG), tocols (DHFA), squalene, and carotenoids (FA). The exception was VA, which increased the degradation of most bioactive compounds. It is believed that adding properly composed mixtures of FA and its derivatives (DHFA and 4-VG) can extend the shelf life of flaxseed oil and provide nutritional benefits."

METHODS: One hundred and twelve patients were randomly selected to four groups with a total burn surface area (TBSA) of 20-50%. The four groups includes olive oil (OO), flaxseed oil (FO), mixture of olive oil and flaxseed oil (OF), and control group and received 30g of oils for three weeks. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), ferritin and albumin level as inflammatory markers, as well as cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as the lipid profile were explored. Wound healing was assessed by photographing on days 2, 8, 15, and 22 (during three weeks of intervention) and were analyzed in imageJ software. RESULTS: The greatest reduction in the level of hs-CRP and ferritin was observed in the OF (-21.38±44.41) (-132.79±165.36), while the lowest reduction was reported in the control group (-36.36±79.03) (141.08±262.36). Compared to control group, OO significantly increased albumin (0.88±0.65). Reduction of wound healing at the end of the first week of intervention was not significant in the study groups. However, the stereology examination showed significant improvement in wound healing at the end of the second and third weeks in the OF. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings, combination of herbal oils reduce inflammation and improve wound healing and showed positive effects on the size of wounds in burn patients."

Flaxseed contains a number of biologically active molecules, which, acting through multiple signalling pathways, can determine numerous physiological, protective and therapeutic effects of flaxseed. The available publications demonstrate the action of flaxseed and its constituents on the female reproductive system - ovarian growth, follicle development, the resulting puberty and reproductive cycles, ovarian cell proliferation and apoptosis, oo- and embryogenesis, hormonal regulators of reproductive processes and their dysfunctions. These effects can be determined by flaxseed lignans, alpha-linolenic acid and their products. Their actions can be mediated by changes in general metabolism, metabolic and reproductive hormones, their binding proteins, receptors and several intracellular signalling pathways, including protein kinases, transcription factors regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and malignant transformation. Flaxseed and its active molecules are found potentially useful for improving farm animal reproductive efficiency and treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome and ovarian cancer.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of pH-shifting on the textural and microstructural properties of mung bean starch (MBS)-flaxseed protein (FP) composite gels. Results showed that different pH-shifting treatments caused changes in hydrogen bond interactions and secondary structures in composite gels, leading to the formation of loose or compact gel networks. The pH 2-shifting modified protein and starch molecules with shorter chains tended to form smaller intermolecular aggregates, resulting in the formation of a looser gel network. For pH 12-shifting treatment, conformational change of FP caused the unfolding of protein and the exposure of more hydrophobic groups, which enhanced the hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions between polymers, contributing to the formation of a compact gel network. Furthermore, pH 12-shifting improved the water-holding capacity (WHC), storage modulus, and strength of gels, while pH 2-treated gels exhibited lower WHC, hardness, and gumminess due to the degradation of MBS and denaturation of FP caused by extreme acid condition. These findings suggest that pH-shifting can alter the gel properties of bi-polymeric starch-protein composite systems by affecting the secondary structures of proteins and the hydrogen bonding between the polymers, and provide a promising way for a wide application of FP in soft gel-type food production.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases, the leading global cause of death, are usually associated with cardiac hypertrophy (CH). CH is an adaptive response of the heart against cardiac overloading, but continuous CH accelerates cardiac remodeling and results in heart failure. Available CH therapies delay the progress of heart failure, but they often fail to control symptoms or restore quality of life. Although flaxseed lignans have been shown to have significant anti-oxidant, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects in various cardiovascular diseases, little is known about their effect on CH. Thus, this study evaluated the therapeutic effect of flaxseed lignans on CH, which was induced by subcutaneous injections with isoproterenol (5 mg/kg b.w) for 14 consecutive days. Flaxseed lignans (200 mg/kg) was given orally for 4 weeks. Cardiac pathological remodeling was evaluated by echocardiography, after which morphometric, biochemical, histological, and ultrastructural analyses were performed. Flaxseed lignans significantly ameliorated CH structural and functional alterations as shown by echocardiography. Lignans also reduced the relative heart weight, significantly decreased the elevated CK-MB and the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde, augmented the myocardial total antioxidant capacity, and ameliorated the histopathological and ultrastructural changes in cardiac tissues and prevented interstitial collagen deposition. The results demonstrate promising anti-hypertrophic effect of flaxseed lignans against isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, via regulating myocardial remodeling and oxidative stress. Therefore, lignans could be used as potential pharmacological intervention in the management of CH."

The primary hypothesis was that there would be differences between blood serum individual free fatty acids (SIFFA) and serum individual total fatty acids (SITFA) in terms of their different relationships (correlations) to each of homeostatic model assessment-individual insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and homeostatic model assessment-individual insulin resistance-percentage β-cell function (HOMA-% β) remaining in human type 2 diabetic patients with pre-flaxseed oil (FXO) and pre-safflower oil (SFO) administration. The secondary hypothesis was that FXO (rich in alpha-linolenic acid, ALA) supplementation would alter these correlations differently in the SIFFA and STIFFA pools in comparison with the placebo SFO (poor in ALA). Methods. Patients were recruited via a newspaper advertisement and two physicians. All patients came to visit 1 and three months later to visit 2. At visit 2, the subjects were randomly assigned (double-blind) to flaxseed or safflower oil (placebo) treatment for three months until visit 3. Results. There were pre-intervention differences in the SIFFA and STIFA pool's relationships with each of HOMA-IR and HOMA-% β. These relatioships remained either unchanged or became significant after intervention (treatment or placebo). There was a negative correlation found between HOMA-IR and serum free ALA (SFALA) mol % after FXO. Serum total ALA (STALA) mol % had no significant correlations with HOMA-IR and HOMA- % β before and after flaxseed oil administration. Conclusions. The SIFFA and SITFA pools have different relationships with HOMA-IR and HOMA-% β for each of pre- and post-intervention. It is concluded that the data support both the primary and the secondary hypotheses indicating that they are correct.",

The solutions were treated at different temperatures (25, 75 and 100 °C) and the particle characteristics and physical properties of the resulted samples were determined. The influence of different concentrations (0.05 % to 0.3 %) of FG addition was evaluated in the SPI solution at 5 % protein concentration. The results showed that heating caused decrease of particle size of the SPI proteins and 100 °C heat treatment caused decrease of hydrophobicity and viscosity of the protein dispersions, and increase of their physical stability, and the effect was more marked at high protein concentration; while heat treatment at 75 °C caused substantial increase in protein hydrophobicity and viscosity, and decrease of stability. Addition of FG resulted in increase of particle size, absolute value of zeta potential and hydrophobicity of the protein solutions. The viscosity of the solution was decreased with addition of FG, but higher FG concentration could lead to higher viscosity. The physical stability of the mixed system was improved at low FG concentrations, but decreased at concentration higher than 0.2 %, which was more significant after 100 °C heat treatment. FG incorporation could improve the boundary lubrication of the protein solutions.",

      "abstract": "Teressa goat is a unique goat breed in Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) of India. Effects of Flaxseed oil (FSO) supplementation in body weight (BW), scrotal circumference (SC), testicular volume (TV) and testicular weight (TW), endocrinological profiles, sex behavioural profiles (SBPs), oxidative stress markers and semen production and its quality profiles in rainy and dry summer season were studied in Teressa goat. Male goats (n = 12) of 3-4 years old were equally divided into control and treated groups. Treated animals received 25 mL FSO per day. Oral drenching of FSO was done in the morning before feeding the concentrate ration. Body weight, scrotal circumference, TV and TW were measured in bucks of FSO treated and untreated during rainy and dry summer seasons. Blood follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), cortisol and prolactin, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in bucks of FSO treated and untreated during rainy and dry summer seasons. Libido score (LS), mating ability score (MAS) and sex behavioural score (SBS) were estimated at time of semen collection in bucks of FSO treated and untreated during rainy and dry summer seasons. Semen samples (n = 100; 50 semen samples from each season; each 25 semen samples from control and treatment groups per season) were collected and analysed for semen quality profiles. One-way ANOVA (control rainy, control dry, treated rainy and treated dry) revealed that BW, SC, TV and TW, FSH, LH, testosterone, TSH, T3 and T4 were higher (P < 0.05) and cortisol and prolactin were lower (P < 0.05) in FSO treated bucks of rainy season followed by untreated bucks of rainy season, FSO treated bucks of dry summer season and were lower (P < 0.05) in untreated bucks of dry summer season. Similarly, TAC, CAT, SOD and GSH, LS, MAS and SBS, and volume, pH, sperm concentration, mass activity, total motility (TM), viability, acrosomal integrity (AcI), plasma membrane integrity (PMI) and nuclear integrity (NI) were higher (P < 0.05) and MDA and TSA were lower (P < 0.05) in FSO treated bucks of rainy season followed by FSO treated bucks of dry summer season, untreated bucks of rainy season and were lower (P < 0.05) in untreated bucks of dry summer season. The results of the present study indicated that the breeding bucks suffered physiological stress (higher cortisol), oxidative stress (higher MDA and deficiency of antioxidants), hormonal imbalance (higher prolactin and cortisol and deficiency of gonadotropins, gonadal hormone and thyroid hormones) and infertility due to poor libido and poor semen production and its quality profiles during dry summer season. Thus, dry summer was more stressful season compared to rainy season for the goat bucks. FSO supplementation mitigated these stresses and improved the scrotal and testicular biometrics, libido, antioxidants, hormones and semen quality profiles in Teressa goat bucks. The current study concluded that FSO effectively improved the hormones, libido, antioxidant profiles, and scrotal and testicular biometrics with cascading beneficial effects on semen quality profiles in Teressa goat bucks under humid tropical island ecosystem of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.",

      "abstract": "Many clinical trials have revealed that flaxseed supplementation might exert a potent antihypertensive influence, but the findings are inconsistent. In this regard, a meta-analysis was carried out to provide a more accurate estimate of the impact of flaxseed supplementation on blood pressure. We searched international databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar till July 2022. A random-effects model was used to calculate weighted mean differences (WMDs). Non-linear dose-response analysis and meta-regression were performed. Meta-analysis of 33 trials (comprising 43 treatment arms) with 2427 participants revealed significant reductions in both systolic (WMD: -3.19 mmHg; 95% CI: -4.15 to -2.24, p < 0.001; I2 = 92.5%, p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD = -2.61 mmHg; 95% CI: -3.27, -1.94, p < 0.001; I2 = 94.1%, p < 0.001) following flaxseed supplementation. Greater effects on SBP and DBP were found in trials with an intervention duration of >20 weeks, ≥30 g day-1 of flaxseed, subjects with BMI 25-30 kg m-2, and in patients with hypertension. Supplementation with various flaxseed products significantly reduced SBP and DBP levels, confirming the hypothesis that flaxseed could be used as an effective supplement for blood pressure management, alongside routine medications.",

      "abstract": "Linosorbs (Los) are cyclic peptides from flaxseed oil composed of the LO mixture (LOMIX). The activity of LO has been reported as being anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory. However, the study of skin protection has still not proceeded. In particular, there are poorly understood mechanisms of melanogenesis to LO. Therefore, we investigated the anti-melanogenesis effects of LOMIX and LO, and its activity was examined in mouse melanoma cell lines. The treatment of LOMIX (50 and 100 μg/mL) and LO (6.25-50 μM) suppressed melanin secretion and synthesis, which were 3-fold increased, in a dose-dependent manner, up to 95%. In particular, [1-9-NαC]-linusorb B3 (LO1) and [1-9-NαC]-linusorb B2 (LO2) treatment (12.5 and 25 μM) highly suppressed the synthesis of melanin in B16F10 cell lines up to 90%, without toxicity. LOMIX and LOs decreased the 2- or 3-fold increased mRNA levels, including the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), Tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), and tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TYRP2) at the highest concentration (25 μM). Moreover, the treatment of 25 μM LO1 and LO2 inhibited the expression of MITF and phosphorylation of upper regulatory proteins such as CREB and PKA. Taken together, these results suggested that LOMIX and its individual LO could inhibit melanin synthesis via downregulating the CREB-dependent signaling pathways, and it could be used for novel therapeutic materials in hyperpigmentation.",

      "abstract": "Mucilage-based flocculants are an alternative to synthetic flocculants and their use in sustainable water treatment relates to their non-toxic and biodegradable nature. Mucilage extracted from flaxseed (FSG) and fenugreek seed (FGG) was evaluated as natural flocculants in a coagulation-flocculation (CF) process for arsenic removal, and were compared against a commercial xanthan gum (XG). Mucilage materials were characterized by spectroscopy (FT-IR, 13C NMR), point-of-zero charge (pHpzc) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Box-Behnken design (BBD) with response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine optimal conditions for arsenic removal for the CF process for three independent variables: coagulant dosage, flocculant dosage and settling time. Two anionic systems were tested: S1, roxarsone (organic arsenate 50 mg L-1) at pH 7 and S2 inorganic arsenate (inorganic arsenate 50 mg L-1) at pH 7.5. Variable arsenic removal (RE, %) was achieved: 92.0 (S1-FSG), 92.3 (S1-FGG), 92.8 (S1-XG), 77.0 (S2-FSG), 69.6 (S2-FGG) and 70.6 (S2-XG) based on the BBD optimization. An in situ kinetic method was used to investigate arsenic removal, where the pseudo-first-order model accounts for the kinetic process. The FSG and FGG materials offer a sustainable alternative for the controlled removal of arsenic in water using a facile CF treatment process with good efficiency, as compared with a commercial xanthan gum."

      "abstract": "Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) is gaining popularity as a superfood due to its health-promoting properties. Mature flax grain includes an array of biologically active cyclic peptides or linusorbs (LOs, also known as cyclolinopeptides) that are synthesized from three or more ribosome-derived precursors. Two flaxseed orbitides, [1-9-NαC]-linusorb B3 and [1-9-NαC]-linusorb B2, suppress immunity, induce apoptosis in a cell line derived from human epithelial cancer cells (Calu-3), and inhibit T-cell proliferation, but the mechanism of LO action is unknown. LO-induced changes in gene expression in both nematode cultures and human cancer cell lines indicate that LOs promoted apoptosis. Specific evidence of LO bioactivity included: (1) distribution of LOs throughout the organism after flaxseed consumption; (2) induction of heat shock protein (HSP) 70A, an indicator of stress; (3) induction of apoptosis in Calu-3 cells; and (4) modulation of regulatory genes (determined by microarray analysis). In specific cancer cells, LOs induced apoptosis as well as HSPs in nematodes. The uptake of LOs from dietary sources indicates that these compounds might be suitable as delivery platforms for a variety of biologically active molecules for cancer therapy."

      "abstract": "Lignans are one of the most important and abundant phytochemicals found in flaxseed-diets. These have shown to possess several health-benefits, including anticancer, antioxidant, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and estrogenic-properties etc. The potential of lignans health-promoting effects are circumscribed due to their poor-bioavailability resulting from their bound structure. Recent studies have demonstrated that various food design strategies can enhance the release of bound-lignans from agro-industrial residues, resulting in a higher bioaccessibility and bioavailability. This review focuses primarily on the bioavailability of flaxseed lignans, key factors affecting it and their pharmacokinetics, different strategies to improve the contents of lignans, their release and delivery. Present study will help to deepen our understanding of the applications of lignans and their dietary-supplements in the prevention and treatment of diseases. Several absorption issues of lignans have been observed such as impaired-bioavailability and variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Therefore, the development of novel strategies for optimizing lignan bioavailability is critical to ensure its successful application, such as the delivery of lignans to biological targets via \"targeted designs.\" In addition, some detailed examination is required to identify and understand the basis of variation in lignans bioavailability caused by interactions with the gastrointestinal system.",
