      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Atopic diseases are global concerns in the today's industrialized world. Allergic rhinitis is the most common allergic condition affecting 20% of individuals. This disorder is associated with remarkable morbidity and rising healthcare expenditure. AIM: Considering the anti-inflammatory properties of a plant Zataria multiflora (ZM) with the common name of Shirazi thyme, a randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate the alleviation of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 30 allergic rhinitis patients were randomly and equally assigned to experimental and control groups. Afterwards, the case group was treated with an extract of ZM and the control group with placebo for 2 months. Finally, the clinical signs and symptoms before and after the treatment according to the SNOT22 questionnaire were analysed. RESULTS: Comparing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and an average score of SNOT22 questionnaire between the two groups before the intervention provided some difference, which was significantly greater after the treatment. Based on this questionnaire, our patients in the ZM syrup group had lower grades than before the treatment and experienced amelioration. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding the significant effect of the ZM syrup in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis, its use is highly recommended. Since allergic rhinitis is a multifactorial condition, the use of herbal antioxidants along with conventional treatment would result in a more effective improvement of the disease."

      "abstract": "In this study, different concentrations of alginate (0%, 1% and 1.5% w/v) enriched with various concentrations of Shirazi thyme (Zataria multiflora Boiss) essential oil (0%, 0.3% and 0.5% w/v), were examined on postharvest characteristics of the fresh pistachio. The measurements (including total phenolic compounds, antioxidant capacity, free fatty acid, peroxide value, aerobic mesophilic bacteria, mold and yeast, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids) were performed after 0, 13, 26 and 39 days during storage (3 ± 1 °C, 80 ± 5% RH). The results showed that alginate edible coating enriched with thyme's essential oil (EO), contributed to the maintenance of higher values of phenolic content and antioxidant activity in comparison with the control. Edible coating treatment of enriched alginate with thyme oil reduced mold and yeast growth compared to the control and the alginate without thyme oil. Peroxide value and free fatty acid content were significantly lower in fruits treated with alginate-thyme in comparison with the control. All fruits which had been treated with alginate-thyme EO showed lower changes in saturated and unsaturated fatty acids after 39 days of storage, and fruits coated with combination of 1% alginate and 0.3% EO showed the highest content of palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid, compared with other treatments."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a common problem in women. Zataria multiflora Boiss is a valuable plant. This herbal plant has been used in different conditions. OBJECTIVES: The study was performed to investigate the effects of Zataria multiflora Boiss to control PMS symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a double-blinded, prospective randomized trial. The study population was the college students living in the dormitories of Isfahan University. Eighty-eight eligible students were randomly divided to intervention and control groups. Students completed the prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms (PRISM) calendar including 30 PMS symptoms for four menstrual cycles (two cycles before, and two after the intervention). The intervention group received pearls containing 20 mg of Zataria multi-flora essence (four pearls each day) for two menstrual cycles, seven days before menstruation. The mean difference of PMS severity score between groups was analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test. The difference in frequency score of symptoms was analyzed using repeated-measure analysis of variance. RESULTS: Thirty-eight students in intervention and 37 students in placebo group completed the study. The groups had no significant difference regarding the severity of PMS. Both groups showed a significant improvement in PMS severity score after the intervention. The repeated-measure analysis of variance showed that the frequency of symptoms decreased significantly in the cycles, but it was not different in intervention and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not support the use of Zataria multiflora Boiss in premenstrual syndrome."
