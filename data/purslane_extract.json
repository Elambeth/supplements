      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Portulaca oleracea L. (purslane) is a dietary plant and a botanical drug with antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the effects of purslane against intestinal-inflammation-associated obesity are yet to be studied. In the present study, we hypothesized that purslane extract could reduce intestinal inflammation associated with metabolic disorder. RESULTS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal% of fat) for a total duration of 14 weeks to establish an obesity model; further, the treatment group was orally administered purslane extract (200 mg/kg/day) during the last 4 weeks. Then, intestinal tissues were detached from the mice for detecting protein expressions through Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined using ELISA kits, whereas the components of purslane extract were detected by ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Chronic oral administration of purslane extract ameliorated colon shortening syndrome and reduced bowel inflammation in HFD-induced obese mice through suppression of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to downregulate TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), Ser32 phosphorylation of NF-κB inhibitor alpha (IκBα), and Ser536 phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 expression levels, thereby inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. CONCLUSION: The present study supports the anti-inflammatory potential of purslane extract for modulating bowel inflammation under obesity through inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "Portulaca oleracea L. (purslane) is a food and a traditional drug worldwide. It exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-tumor, and anti-diabetic bioactivities; but its activity on diabetic-associated endothelial dysfunction is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of purslane on endothelial function and the underlying mechanisms. Male C57BL/6 mice had 14-week ad libitum access to a high-fat rodent diet containing 60% kcal% fat to induce obesity and diabetes whereas purslane extract (200 mg/kg/day) was administered during the last 4 weeks via intragastric gavage. Primary rat aortic endothelial cells and isolated mouse aortas were cultured with a risk factor, high glucose or tunicamycin, together with purslane extract. By ESI-QTOF-MS/MS, flavonoids and their glycoside products were identified in the purslane extract. Exposure to high glucose or tunicamycin impaired acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations in aortas and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress with the downregulation of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/ endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling. Co-incubation with purslane significantly ameliorated these impairments. The effects of purslane were abolished by Compound C (AMPK inhibitor). Four-week purslane treatment ameliorated aortic relaxations, ER stress, and oxidative stress in diabetic obese mice. This study supported that purslane protected endothelial function, and inhibited ER stress and oxidative stress in vasculature through AMPK/eNOS activation, revealing its therapeutic potential against vascular complications in diabetes."

      "abstract": "Enzymatic browning is one of the major difficulties for the preservation and commercial value of fresh-cut products. To research more healthy and inexpensive anti-browning methods, we investigated the effect of ultrasonic coupling purslane extract on the browning resistance of fresh-cut potato during 8d storage at 4 °C. Firstly, the optimal ultrasonic time (10 min) was obtained. Then, the results showed that the combined application with lower purslane extract concentration (0.02%, w/w) could achieve a better anti-browning effect than the optimal concentration of alone purslane extract (0.05%, w/w). The combined application not only significantly inhibited the key enzyme activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD), but also effectively reduced the damage to cell membrane, maintained its integrity and permeability. Meanwhile, it also improved antioxidant capacity during storage. Overall, the ultrasonic cavitation combined with purslane extract would be a promising method for fresh-cut industry.",

      "abstract": "Purslane extract (PE) is derived from Portulaca oleracea L., a medicinal plant used in traditional medicine for its antidiabetic properties. This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PE in improving glucose control, blood pressure, and lipid profile in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with a single oral hypoglycemic agent at baseline. Subjects were randomized to treatment with three capsules of PE/day or a matched placebo. Change from baseline to the week 12 end-of-follow-up visit measures of glucose homeostasis, hemodynamics, and lipid profile was compared by treatment assignment. In addition, these measures were evaluated in a subgroup of \"responders,\" defined as patients whose week 12 HbA1c was lower than baseline values, regardless of treatment assignment. This group was further assessed in subgroups of baseline oral hypoglycemic treatment. A total of 63 participants were treated with either PE (n = 31, 11 females, mean age 52.4 ± 7.9 years) or matched placebo (n = 32, 11 females, mean age 58.3 ± 10.8 years). In the total cohort, systolic blood pressure declined significantly more in the PE group than the placebo group: -7.5 ± 5.0 versus -0.01 ± 0.3 mmHg, P < .0001. In the responders' subgroup, HbA1c declined significantly more in the PE group than the placebo group: -0.8% ± 0.4% versus -0.6% ± 0.5%, P = .03. Few adverse events were reported. These were mild and did not differ by treatment assignment. PE appears to be a safe, adjunct treatment for T2DM, significantly reducing systolic blood pressure in the total cohort and HbA1c in the subgroup of responders.",
