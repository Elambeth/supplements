      "abstract": "Most studies suggest that B vitamins can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), and research in this field has been growing. Focusing on 2617 articles in the field, this study used CiteSpace and VOSviewer software to evaluate the contributions of various countries/regions, institutions, authors and journals. The United States and Harvard University were identified as the most productive nation and institution, respectively, with Edward L. Giovannucci (Harvard) being the top contributor. Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention was recognized as the leading journal. Through the analysis of keywords and citations, we found that the potential of B vitamins (B1, B2, B6, B9, and B12) in the prevention and treatment of CRC and their mechanisms including regulation of gene expression, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, and modulation of gut microenvironment are hot topics of research in this field. Burst detection analysis further revealed that the application of nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery systems (such as folate-conjugated nanocarriers) in the treatment of CRC represents both a current hotspot and a future trend. This study offers a comprehensive overview of the field, highlights research hotspots and trends, and offers valuable information for researchers to further grasp the research direction."

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a prevalent condition characterized by damage to peripheral nerves, often linked to risk factors such as diabetes. This condition results from various forms of neural damage, including injury to the cell body, axons, or demyelination, frequently beginning with small and thinly or unmyelinated fibers. Such nerve damage disrupts normal signaling, leading to symptoms like numbness, tingling, and pain. Effective nerve repair and regeneration, particularly through remyelination, are essential therapeutic objectives. While vitamin B12's role in repair processes has been well established, emerging evidence suggests that other neurotropic vitamins, specifically B1 and B6, also contribute significantly to nerve health and symptom relief in PN. In this study, we demonstrate that a combination treatment of vitamins B1, B6, and B12 enhances repair and oxidative stress responses in co-cultures of neural and Schwann cells, leading to improved cell maturation and connectivity compared to vitamin B12 alone. Furthermore, proteomic analysis supports these observations at the molecular level, with enhanced cellular recycling processes like proteasome enhancement, as well as protein synthesis upregulation, needed to rebuild nerve connections and combatting oxidative stress. Our combined morphological and molecular results highlight the potential therapeutic advantage of the B1, B6, and B12 combination over vitamin B12 alone.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Schizophrenia which is a chronic disabling burdensome psychotic disorder has been treated with different antipsychotic medications. Some studies have reported a possible correlation between deficiency in minerals, nutrients and vitamins - mainly group B vitamins - and the development of schizophrenia. In the present study, we aimed to examine the effect of the B vitamin group as an adjuvant treatment to antipsychotics in individuals with chronic schizophrenia. Method : In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial study, involving two groups of 25 patients with chronic schizophrenia, we compared the effects of a 12-week adjuvant treatment with a combination of B vitamins - B1 (15mg), B2 (15mg), B6 (10mg), B12 (10µg) and nicotinamide (50 mg) - with a placebo. The impact on negative, positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia was assessed for both groups before the intervention (T0) and at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the intervention (T1, T2, and T3, respectively). Results: Following the treatment, negative symptoms scores decreased in the treatment group at 12 weeks following the beginning of the treatment (F (4, 45) = 464.7, P < 0.0001). Although a trend toward improvement in positive symptoms and cognitive scores was seen, these changes were not significant. Conclusion: Our results suggest that selecting the group B vitamins as an adjuvant treatment to the antipsychotics may have beneficial effects on improving negative symptoms of patients with chronic schizophrenia."

      "abstract": "Water-soluble B vitamins, mainly obtained through dietary intake of fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products, act as co-factors in various biochemical processes, including DNA synthesis, repair, methylation, and energy metabolism. These vitamins include B1 (Thiamine), B2 (Riboflavin), B3 (Niacin), B5 (Pantothenic Acid), B6 (Pyridoxine), B7 (Biotin), B9 (Folate), and B12 (Cobalamin). Recent studies have shown that besides their fundamental physiological roles, B vitamins influence oncogenic metabolic pathways, including glycolysis (Warburg effect), mitochondrial function, and nucleotide biosynthesis. Although deficiencies in these vitamins are associated with several complications, emerging evidence suggests that excessive intake of specific B vitamins may also contribute to cancer progression and interfere with therapy due to impaired metabolic and genetic functions. This review discusses the tumor-suppressive and tumor-progressive roles of B vitamins in cancer. It also explores the recent evidence on a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between B vitamin metabolism and cancer progression and underscores the need for further research to determine the optimal balance of B vitamin intake for cancer prevention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD) refers to the cognitive impairment observed in individuals with diabetes. Epidemiological studies have suggested that supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) or B vitamins may prevent the development of diabetic complications. Post hoc studies indicate a potential synergistic effect of n-3 PUFA and B vitamins in preventing cognitive impairment. However, the precise effect and underlying mechanism of this combination on DCD remain unclear. In case-control study, we compared fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membrane and serum homocysteine levels between diabetic individuals with and without DCD. We found that insufficient levels of n-3 PUFA, along with elevated serum homocysteine, significantly increase the risk of developing DCD. Treatment with a combination of fish oil, folate, and vitamin B12 improved cognitive impairment and aberrant neuronal morphology in streptozotocin-induced DCD mice. Folic acid and vitamin B12 enhanced the efficiency of exogenous docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) transportation to the brain by preventing the accumulation of homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine, thereby inhibiting neuronal apoptosis in diabetic brains. Furthermore, folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation can provide sufficient 5-methylcytosine for diabetic brains by promoting DNA methylation, while increased DHA levels maintain TET-mediated active DNA demethylation in diabetic brains through enhancing TET2 function. Overall, our study provides novel insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic preventive effects of the combined supplementation with fish oil, folic acid and vitamin B12 on DCD, suggests that combining n-3 PUFA and B vitamins could be a promising strategy for preventing DCD among individuals with diabetes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and lack of micronutrients are seen in many patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Considering that vitamins play an important role in preventing or protecting against inflammation at the metabolic, physiological, and pathological levels, this research was aimed to investigate the effect of a number of vitamin B groups in improving UC. METHODS: Experimental colitis was induced by rectal administration of acetic acid (3%) in male Wistar rats, and mega doses of thiamine (20 mg/kg), riboflavin (15 mg/kg), pyridoxine (30 mg/kg), and cyanocobalamin (250 μg/kg) alone or in combination were administered intraperitoneally for 5 days. In another group, normal dose (1/10 of the above-mentioned doses) of four vitamins in combination was administered for 15 days (started 10 days before colitis induction). Colon tissues were weighted and evaluated in terms of macroscopic, microscopic, and biochemical markers. RESULTS: Normal dose of four vitamins in combination form and mega dose of thiamine caused a significant increase in the body weight of animals. All treatments except for pyridoxine (mega dose) diminished ulceration index, total colitis index, and colon weight compared to the control group. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased significantly in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerative properties of selected B vitamins improved experimental colitis regardless of the dosage and duration of treatment. Despite its beneficial effect on biochemical markers, pyridoxine had the least effect in reducing the pathological features of colitis. More studies are needed to confirm the effect of these vitamins in the clinical setting of this disease."

      "abstract": "Sepsis is a prevalent form of acute and critical illness encountered in intensive care unit (ICU), characterized by a high mortality and cognitive impairments among survivors. The pathogenesis of sepsis primarily involves immune dysfunction and excessive oxidative stress. Consequently, immune modulation, along with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant strategies, has emerged as a focal point in the treatment of sepsis. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of B vitamins to modulate immune cell activity while exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, thereby garnering significant interest regarding their therapeutic efficacy in sepsis management. Notably, vitamin B2 and vitamin B9 are recognized for their roles in regulating immune cells and facilitating immune modulation. Vitamins B1, B2, B6, and B12 demonstrate notable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Specifically, vitamin B1 exerts its antioxidant influence through the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle while mitigating inflammation by modulating inflammatory factor levels in septic patients-an application that has been integrated into clinical practice. The anti-inflammatory action of vitamin B2 is achieved through the regulation of inflammatory mediators in septic patients alongside reducing inflammasome activation within macrophages. Vitamin B6 contributes to both anti-inflammatory responses and antioxidative defense by scavenging free radicals and enhancing the production of antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, vitamins B1, B6, B9, and B14 have shown promise in improving neurocognitive function among individuals suffering from sepsis. This article reviews the immunomodulatory functions as well as the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects associated with various B vitamins while exploring their applications within sepsis treatment to propose novel therapeutic avenues.",

This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect of donepezil and each of vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and vitamin B1 on aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Fifty-four rats were divided into nine groups of six. Group I received distilled water, group II-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg), group III- AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Donepezil (10 mg/kg), group IV-AlCl3(100 mg/kg) + Donepezil (10 mg/kg) + Vitamin B12 (5 mg/kg), group V-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Donepezil (10 mg/kg) + Vitamin B6 (5 mg/kg), group VI-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Donepezil (10 mg/kg) + Vitamin B1 (5 mg/kg), group VII-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Vitamin B12 (5 mg/kg), group VIII-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Vitamin B6 (5 mg/kg), group IX-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Vitamin B1 (5 mg/kg). Treatment lasted for 40 days. Biochemical analyses of the brain revealed that chronic administration of AlCl3 significantly increased the level of inflammatory cytokines, caspase 9, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, while causing a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, Nrf2, reduced glutathione, dopamine and norepinephrine. Results also showed that AlCl3 caused cognitive impairment as indicated by a reduction in the percentage alternation index and hypo-activity towards novel object in animals treated with AlCl3 only. Moreover, results from biochemical evaluations indicated that treatment with donepezil, B vitamins and combination of donepezil and B vitamins attenuated the deficits in dopamine, norepinephrine, Nrf2, SOD and reduced glutathione, while also reducing the elevated levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, AChE, caspase 9 and inflammatory markers. These observations were corroborated by result of histopathological evaluation. The combination of donepezil and vitamin B12, B6 and B1 proved to be more effective than donepezil monotherapy. Donepezil conferred significant protection against AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity, however, the combination of donepezil and vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and Vitamin B1 significantly performed better in neuroprotective indices than donepezil monotherapy. The combination of donepezil and vitamin B1 was better amongst the three combination therapies in this study.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: In this review, we aim to summarize recent information about the association of B vitamins with immune-metabolic aspects of depression and their connection with the gut-brain axis. VIEWS: B vitamins may alter depressive symptoms by many various mechanisms such as reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, gut permeability, controlling epigenetics, modifying the microbiome, and stimulating it to produce many beneficial substances such as short-chain fatty acids or neurotransmitters: norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and acetylcholine. CONCLUSIONS: Specifically, vitamins B1 (thiamine), B6 (pyridoxine), B9 (folate), and B12 (cyanocobalamin), B2 (riboflavin) have been observed to affect depression. Given probiotic's capability to produce vitamins from the B group, and modify intestinal function, inflammation, or metabolic dysfunction, their supplementation might be a possible treatment method for the immunometabolic form of depression. Thus, the intake of certain probiotic bacterial strains simultaneously with controlling the required daily intake of B vitamins may positively affect the course of depression. Circulating B vitamins metabolite levels, especially B9, B12, and B6 may also be biomarkers of depression. Further investigation is needed to find stronger evidence on this topic.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of phentolamine combined with B vitamins in treating FI in late preterm infants and to explore its effects on gastrointestinal symptoms, inflammation and complications. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We randomly assigned 118 late preterm infants with FI to a treatment group (n = 56) or a control group (n = 62). The treatment group received intravenous phentolamine and intramuscular B vitamins, whereas the control group received basic treatment only. We measured the time of disappearance of gastrointestinal symptoms, the time of basal at-tainment, the time of hospitalisation, the incidence of complications, the concentrations of inflammatory markers and the overall effective rate of treatment. RESULTS: The treatment group had a shorter duration of gastrointestinal symptoms than did the control group (p < 0.01). The treatment group also had lower concentrations of inflammatory markers and a higher overall effective rate than did the control group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the two groups in the time of hospitalisation, basal attainment, weight re-covery and the incidence of complications (p > 0.05).

In this study, we report that proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) activation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contributes to chronic pain and tendon histopathological changes produced by Achilles tendon partial transection injury (TTI). Tendon partial transection injury increases the expression of PAR2 protein in both somata of DRG neurons and their peripheral terminals within the injured Achilles tendon. Activation of PAR2 promotes the primary sensory neuron plasticity by activating downstream cAMP-PKA pathway, phosphorylation of PKC, CaMKII, and CREB. Blocking PAR2 signaling by PAR2 small-interference RNA or antagonistic peptide PIP delays the onset of TTI-induced pain, reverses the ongoing pain, as well as inhibits sensory nerve sprouting, and promotes structural remodeling of the injured tendon. Vitamin B complex (VBC), containing thiamine (B1), pyridoxine (B6), and cyanocobalamin (B12), is effective to ameliorate TTI-induced pain, inhibit ectopic nerve sprouting, and accelerate tendon repair, through suppressing PAR2 activation. These findings reveal a critical role of PAR2 signaling in the development of chronic pain and histopathological alterations of injured tendon following Achilles tendon injury. This study suggests that the pharmaceuticals targeting PAR2, such as VBC, may be an effective approach for the treatment of tendon injury-induced pain and promoting tendon repair.",

In this study, we investigated thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folate in various faba bean, lupin, and pea ingredients. Further, the retention of B vitamins in high moisture extrusion was studied. Prior to liquid chromatographic determinations of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folate, vitamins were extracted by acid hydrolysis (niacin), enzymatic treatment (folate), or their combination (thiamin and riboflavin). The contents (on a dry matter basis) varied greatly among different ingredients: the thiamin content was 0.2-14.2 µg/g; riboflavin, 0.3-5.9 µg/g; niacin, 8.8-35.5 µg/g, and folate, 45-1453 ng/g. Generally, the highest levels were in flours and protein concentrates, whereas low levels were observed in isolates. The retention of B vitamins was excellent in high moisture extrusion, except for folate in faba bean, where the folate contents were 42-67% lower in the extrudates than in the respective ingredient mixtures. In terms of both vitamin B contents and their retention, extrudates containing substantial amounts of flour or protein concentrate are promising plant-based sources of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folate."

A multidisciplinary team including endocrinology, neurology, and pharmacy from Thailand discussed and aligned the practical scheme of DPN management in the community pharmacy setting, using the literature review and having face-to-face meeting. Five major statements have been endorsed as consensus recommendations for DPN care with strong acknowledgment. The aims of DPN management included reducing symptoms and the risk of complications, minimising adverse reactions from treatment regimens, and improving patients' knowledge and adherence to the treatment strategies. An initial screening process using a 7 items interview of Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) questionnaire should be implemented to identify patients at risk of developing DPN. Subsequently, pharmacologic, and non-pharmacologic treatment should be employed based on patient-centered care. An interesting approach is combination of neurotropic B vitamins, which may be used as monotherapy or combination therapy to control DPN symptoms. The combined therapy potentially exhibits a synergistic effect and improves patient adherence. The consensus would be further considered in context of harmonisation of routine practice and country requirements."

      "abstract": "The present review deals with two main ingredients of energy/power drinks: B vitamins and glucuronolactone and their possible effect on the immune system. There is a strong relationship between the recommended daily dose of selected B vitamins and a functional immune system. Regarding specific B vitamins: (1) Riboflavin is necessary for the optimization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the fight against bacterial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes. (2) Niacin administered within normal doses to obese rats can change the phenotype of skeletal fibers, and thereby affect muscle metabolism. This metabolic phenotype induced by niacin treatment is also confirmed by stimulation of the expression of genes involved in the metabolism of free fatty acids (FFAs) and oxidative phosphorylation at this level. (3) Vitamin B5 effects depend primarily on the dose, thus large doses can cause diarrhea or functional disorders of the digestive tract whereas normal levels are effective in wound healing, liver detoxification, and joint health support. (4) High vitamin B6 concentrations (>2000 mg per day) have been shown to exert a significant negative impact on the dorsal root ganglia. Whereas, at doses of approximately 70 ng/mL, sensory symptoms were reported in 80% of cases. (5) Chronic increases in vitamin B12 have been associated with the increased incidence of solid cancers. Additionally, glucuronolactone, whose effects are not well known, represents a controversial compound. (6) Supplementing with D-glucarates, such as glucuronolactone, may help the body's natural defense system function better to inhibit different tumor promoters and carcinogens and their consequences. Cumulatively, the present review aims to evaluate the relationship between the selected B vitamins group, glucuronolactone, and the immune system and their associations to bioavailability, doses, and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly common globally, particularly among postmenopausal women. Diet plays a fundamental role in the treatment of NAFLD. However, clinical research on the dietary intakes of B vitamins, specifically in postmenopausal women, is scant. Hence, it is imperative to study the impact of B vitamin dietary intake in postmenopausal women. METHODS: This study utilized National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data for 668 postmenopausal women. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association of the intakes of B vitamins with hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis prevalence. The analysis accounted for various covariates and employed restricted cubic spline analysis to examine potential nonlinear relationships. Additionally, interactions among age, diabetes, and B-vitamin intakes, as well as the interaction between folate and vitamin B12 intake, were explored. RESULTS: Higher intakes of folate [0.30 (0.10-0.88)], choline [0.26 (0.07-0.95)], vitamin B1, and vitamin B2 were associated with a reduced risk of hepatic steatosis in postmenopausal women. The associations of niacin (P-nonlinear = 0.0003), vitamin B1 (P-nonlinear = 0.036), and vitamin B2 (P-nonlinear<0.0001) intakes with hepatic steatosis showed a nonlinear pattern. However, no significant associations were observed between the intakes of niacin, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 and hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, there were no significant associations between B-vitamin intakes and liver fibrosis. No interaction effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Dietary intakes of folate, choline, vitamin B1, and vitamin B2 may be associated with liver steatosis in postmenopausal women, these results suggest that optimizing the intake of these specific B vitamins may have a protective effect against liver steatosis in postmenopausal women, offering valuable insights into potential dietary strategies to promote their well-being."

In this study we analysed plasma samples obtained in a randomised clinical trial and aimed compare levels of vitamins B1, B2, B3 and B6, and their related vitamers and metabolites in patients with IBD, with or without chronic fatigue and with or without effect of high dose oral thiamine for chronic fatigue. METHODS: Blood samples from patients with fatigue were drawn prior and after thiamine exposure and only once for patients without fatigue. A wide panel of analysis were done at Bevital AS Lab. RESULTS: Concentration of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) was lower in patients with chronic fatigue compared to patients without fatigue (p = 0.02). Patients with chronic fatigue who reported a positive effect on fatigue after 4 weeks of high dose thiamine treatment had a statistically significantly lower level of riboflavin after thiamine treatment (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: FMN and Riboflavin were associated with chronic fatigue in patients with quiescent IBD. Levels of other B vitamins and metabolites were not significantly different between the investigated groups or related to effect of the thiamine intervention.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between vitamin B status and human CVD development in order to provide more specific advice about vitamin B intake for those at risk of CVD. DATA SOURCES: Relevant articles were identified by JSTOR, PubMed, and ProQuest databases. DATA EXTRACTION: Key words used to identify the studies included the different combinations of B-vitamins, folate, folic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, homocysteine, cardiovascular disease, stroke, coronary disease, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular and transient ischemic attack. The database search was supplemented by hand-searching of reference lists of selected articles. DATA ANALYSIS: Pooled estimates were calculated from the mean differences using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Supplementation with folic acid was reported to have a clinical benefit of significantly reducing carotid intima-media thickness. Higher intakes of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 were generally associated with a lower risk of CVD in the general population, except in those without normal renal function and those with unstable angina or past non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: Vitamin B supplementation resulted in the greatest cardiovascular benefit in those with normal renal function and without unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction recently. Factors such as age, gender, and genetic polymorphisms contribute to varying effects.",

Impacts on stress-related quality-of-life parameters (depression, anxiety, sleep, and perception of pain) were also explored. METHODS: The study recruited a total of 40 adults (20 per group), suffering from stress for more than 1 month and scaling ≥14 points on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)-42 questionnaire at the time of inclusion. Individuals received oral Mg-Teadiola or placebo for 28 days (D). fMRI analysis was used to visualize the interplay between stress and pain cerebral matrices, using thermal stress model, at baseline (D0) and after D28. RESULTS: Based on blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variations during the stress stimulation (before pain perception), a significantly increased activation between D0 and D28 was observed for left and right frontal area (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively), left and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (p = 0.035 and p = 0.04, respectively), and left and right insula (p = 0.034 and p = 0.0402, respectively) in Mg-Teadiola versus placebo group. During thermal pain stimulation, a significantly diminished activation of the pain matrix was observed between D0 and D28, for left and right prefrontal area (both p = 0.001), left and right insula (p = 0.008 and p = 0.019, respectively), and left and right ventral striatum (both p = 0.001) was observed in Mg-Teadiola versus placebo group. These results reinforce the clinical observations, showing a perceived benefit of Mg-Teadiola on several parameters. After 1 month of treatment, DASS-42 stress score significantly decreased in Mg-Teadiola group [effect size (ES) -0.46 (-0.91; -0.01), p = 0.048]. Similar reductions were observed on D14 (p = 0.011) and D56 (p = 0.008). Sensitivity to cold also improved from D0 to D28 for Mg-Teadiola versus placebo [ES 0.47 (0.02; 0.92) p = 0.042]. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with Mg-Teadiola reduced stress on D28 in chronically stressed but otherwise healthy individuals and modulated the stress and pain cerebral matrices during stressful thermal stimulus."

The metabolic relationships of B vitamins determine the more frequent occurrence of poly-, rather than monovitamin deficiency. Since B vitamins play an important role in the processes of energy production and in the functioning of neurotransmitter systems, the first symptoms of such polyhypovitaminosis are signs of brain dysfunction: asthenia, depression, anxiety, cognitive disorders. Correct diagnosis of polyhypovitaminosis based on the identification of risk groups of patients and the determination of their subclinical or early manifesting signs of brain dysfunction is the most important task of a practicing physician. Detection of insufficient intake and vitamin content, as well as verification of the onset of symptoms of brain dysfunction and the appointment of adequate therapy can significantly increase the effectiveness of treatment, as well as prevent asthenic, psycho-emotional and cognitive disorders in patients with polyhypovitaminosis.",

The study compared serum levels of B vitamins measured after the therapy and at baseline. The second part of the study focused on the assessment of the laboratory findings reflecting the severity of cardiovascular pathology and indicating an increased risk of vascular catastrophes. RESULTS: Clinical trials among patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure showed that the intake of synthetic forms of pyridoxine, folic acid, and cyanocobalamin slightly increases systolic, diastolic and central venous pressure while decreasing the heart rate and increasing LVEF. Thiamine acts as a vasodilator. It reduces the cardiac afterload and improves heart function.

      "abstract": "Micronutrient deficiency still occurs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) despite the availability of several food resources, particularly fermented foods and vegetables, with high nutritional potential. Fermentation enhances the quality of food in several aspects. Organoleptically, certain taste, aroma, and textures are developed. Health and safety are improved by inhibiting the growth of several foodborne pathogens and removing harmful toxic compounds. Furthermore, nutrition is enhanced by improving micronutrient contents and bioavailability from the food, especially vitamin B content. However, during processing and before final consumption, many fermented foods are heat treated (drying, pasteurization, cooking, etc.) to make the food digestible and safe for consumption. Heat treatment improves the bioavailability of B-vitamins in some foods. In other foods, heating decreases the nutritional value because some B-vitamins are degraded. In SSA, cooked starchy foods are often associated with vegetables in household meals. This paper reviews studies that have focused fermented starchy foods and vegetable foods in SSA with the potential to provide B-vitamins to consumers. The review also describes the process of the preparation of these foods for final consumption, and techniques that can prevent or lessen B-vitamin loss, or enrich B-vitamins prior to consumption.",

The current therapies focusing on reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) are often insufficient to prevent the progression of the disease, so the therapeutic management of glaucoma remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective, IOP-lowering independent effects of a nutritional supplement containing forskolin, homotaurine, spearmint extract and vitamins of the B group in a model of acute glaucoma developed in mice. Glaucoma was induced in adult wild-type C57BL/6J mice by transient elevation of IOP. The dietary supplement, branded as Gangliomix® (125 mg/kg/day), was administered by oral gavage for 17 days and ocular hypertension was induced on the 10th day of treatment. A histological analysis of the retinas was performed and RGC survival was evaluated with fluorogold labeling and Brn3a immunostaining on wholemount and retinal sections. Expression of alpha-spectrin, caspase-3, PARP-1 and GFAP was studied with western blotting or immunofluorescence. A significant increase in RGC survival was reported in the retina of mice treated with the dietary supplement as compared to vehicle-treated animals. The observed neuroprotection was associated with a calpain activity decrease, reduction in caspase-3 and PARP-1 activation, and prevention of GFAP upregulation. These effects were independent from the hypotensive effects of the supplement. Altogether, our data suggest that the dietary supplementation with forskolin, homotaurine, spearmint extract and vitamins of the B group supports RGC survival and may offer beneficial effects in glaucoma patients in combination with the currently used IOP-lowering therapy."

      "abstract": "B vitamins play important roles in various physiological processes, including cell metabolism and DNA synthesis. The intestine is critical for the absorption and utilization of B vitamins, but few analytical methods for detecting intestinal B vitamins are currently available. In this study, we developed a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of 10 B vitamins in mouse colon tissue, including thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), nicotinic acid (B3), niacinamide (B3-AM), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (B6-5P), biotin (B7), folic acid (B9), and cyanocobalamin (B12). The method was thoroughly validated following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines and yielded good results in terms of linearity (r2 > 0.9928), lower limit of quantification (40-600 ng/g), accuracy (88.9-119.80 %) and precision (relative standard deviation ≤ 19.71 %), recovery (87.95-113.79 %), matrix effect (91.26-113.78 %), and stability (85.65-114.05 %). Furthermore, we applied our method to profile B vitamins in the colons of mice with breast cancer after doxorubicin chemotherapy treatment, which revealed that the doxorubicin treatment led to significant colon damage and accumulation of several B vitamins including B1, B2 and B5. We also confirmed the capability of this method for quantifying B vitamins in other intestinal tissues like the ileum, jejunum, and duodenum. The newly developed method is simple, specific, and useful for targeted profiling of B vitamins in mouse colon, with a potential for future studies on the role of these micronutrients in healthy and diseased states.",

      "abstract": "Suboptimal status of folate and/or interrelated B vitamins (B12 , B6 and riboflavin) can perturb one-carbon metabolism and adversely affect brain development in early life and brain function in later life. Human studies show that maternal folate status during pregnancy is associated with cognitive development in the child, whilst optimal B vitamin status may help to prevent cognitive dysfunction in later life. The biological mechanisms explaining these relationships are not clear but may involve folate-related DNA methylation of epigenetically controlled genes related to brain development and function. A better understanding of the mechanisms linking these B vitamins and the epigenome with brain health at critical stages of the lifecycle is necessary to support evidence-based health improvement strategies. The EpiBrain project, a transnational collaboration involving partners in the United Kingdom, Canada and Spain, is investigating the nutrition-epigenome-brain relationship, particularly focussing on folate-related epigenetic effects in relation to brain health outcomes. We are conducting new epigenetics analysis on bio-banked samples from existing well-characterised cohorts and randomised trials conducted in pregnancy and later life. Dietary, nutrient biomarker and epigenetic data will be linked with brain outcomes in children and older adults. In addition, we will investigate the nutrition-epigenome-brain relationship in B vitamin intervention trial participants using magnetoencephalography, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging modality to assess neuronal functioning. The project outcomes will provide an improved understanding of the role of folate and related B vitamins in brain health, and the epigenetic mechanisms involved. The results are expected to provide scientific substantiation to support nutritional strategies for better brain health across the lifecycle.",

Therefore, intervention of vitamin level in the body is expected to be a potential strategy to reduce the risk of breast cancer. However, the current epidemiological findings of serum vitamin levels and breast cancer risk are inconsistent, and the relationship between serum vitamin and breast cancer is still controversial. In this study, we compared the serum vitamin expression levels of healthy people, benign breast patients, and breast cancer patients, and evaluated the relationship between B vitamin levels and breast cancer risk. METHODS: The study used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine the serum vitamin levels of 520 people who attended Yunnan Cancer Hospital from September 2020 to December 2020. After screening by exclusion criteria, 38 patients with benign breast diseases, 87 patients with breast cancer and 91 healthy controls were finally included. The kruskal-wallis H test was used to compare the differences in serum vitamin levels of subjects. Χ2 test was used to evaluate the relationship between B vitamin level and age,BMI,TNM staging,Ki-67,Her-2,surgery and chemotherapy, and other baseline characteristics and through binary logistic regression analysis, calculating odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) to evaluate the relationship between B vitamins and breast cancer risk. CONCLUSION: The levels of VitB1 and VitB5 in the serum of breast cancer patients and patients with benign breast diseases were higher than those in the healthy control group, while the expression levels of VitB3 in breast cancer patients were lower than those in the healthy control group and the breast benign disease groups. The level of VitB1 was positively correlated with breast cancer risk. The VitB3 level was negatively correlated with breast cancer risk. The VitB5 level is not significantly related to the risk of breast cancer."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that daily supplementation with low-dose B vitamins plus betaine could significantly reduce plasma homocysteine concentrations in Chinese adults with hyperhomocysteinemia and free from background mandatory folic acid fortification. METHODS: One hundred apparently healthy adults aged 18-65 years with hyperhomocysteinemia were recruited in South China from July 2019 to June 2021. They were randomly assigned to either the supplement group (daily supplementation: 400 μg folic acid, 8 mg vitamin B6, 6.4 μg vitamin B12 and 1 g betaine) or the placebo group for 12 weeks. Fasting venous blood was collected at baseline, week 4 and week 12 to determine the concentrations of homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12 and betaine. Generalized estimation equations were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Statistically significant increments in blood concentrations of folate, vitamin B12 and betaine after the intervention in the supplement group indicated good participant compliance. At baseline, there were no significant differences in plasma homocysteine concentration between the two groups (P = 0.265). After 12-week supplementation, compared with the placebo group, there was a significant reduction in plasma homocysteine concentrations in the supplement group (mean group difference - 3.87; covariate-adjusted P = 0.012; reduction rate 10.1%; covariate-adjusted P < 0.001). In the supplement group, the decreased concentration of plasma homocysteine was associated with increments of blood concentrations of both folate (β = -1.680, P = 0.004) and betaine (β = -1.421, P = 0.020) after 12 weeks of supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation with low-dose B vitamins plus betaine for 12 weeks effectively decreased plasma homocysteine concentrations in Chinese adults with hyperhomocysteinemia.

As a result, mono- and diaqua products are formed which further undergo complexation with guanine or adenine. Consequently, many processes are triggered, which lead to the death of the cancer cell. The theoretical and experimental studies confirm that such types of interactions can also occur with other chemical compounds. The vitamins from B group have a similar structure to the nucleobases of DNA and have aromatic rings with single-pair orbitals. Theoretical and experimental studies were performed to describe the interactions of B vitamins with Pt (II) derivatives such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. The obtained results were compared with the values for guanine. Two levels of simulations were implemented at the theoretical level, namely, B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) with LANL2DZ bases set for platinum atoms and MN15/def2-TZVP. The polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM preparation) and water as a solvent were used. UV-Vis spectroscopy was used to describe the drug-nucleobase and drug-B vitamin interactions. Values of the free energy (ΔGr) show spontaneous reactions with mono- and diaqua derivatives of cisplatin and oxaliplatin; however, interactions with diaqua derivatives are more preferable. The strength of these interactions was also compared. Carboplatin products have the weakest interaction with the studied structures. The presence of non-covalent interactions was demonstrated in the tested complexes. A good agreement between theory and experiment was also demonstrated.",

This is notably linked to their capacity to get from their microbiota any essential component lacking in the diet such as vitamins and amino acids. Over a century of research based on dietary analysis, antimicrobial treatment, gnotobiotic rearing, and culture-independent microbe detection progressively generated a wealth of information about the role of the microbiota in specific aspects of insect fitness. Thanks to the recent increase in sequencing capacities, whole-genome sequencing of a number of symbionts has facilitated tracing of biosynthesis pathways, validation of experimental data and evolutionary analyses. This field of research has generated a considerable set of data in a diversity of hosts harboring specific symbionts or nonspecific microbiota members. Here, we review the current knowledge on the involvement of the microbiota in insect and tick nutrition, with a particular focus on B vitamin provision. We specifically question if there is any specificity of B vitamin provision by symbionts compared to the redundant yet essential contribution of nonspecific microbes. We successively highlight the known aspects of microbial vitamin provision during three main life stages of invertebrates: postembryonic development, adulthood, and reproduction.",

Blood samples from the participants were collected before the oocyte pick-up procedure, and serum levels of riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6 (including PA and PLP), folate, and methylmalonic acid (MMA) were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Endpoints were classified into three groups according to tertiles (lower, middle, and upper) of each vitamin index, and the association of the serum vitamin status with intermediate and clinical outcomes was analyzed using a generalized estimating equation model. Higher riboflavin levels were associated with elevated probabilities of high-quality embryos, as well as clinical pregnancy after embryo transfer. A greater likelihood of transferable embryos was found in the middle tertile of serum folate. Similarly, a negative correlation of serum MMA, a marker of vitamin B12 deficiency, with high-quality embryos was identified. No significance was observed for other vitamins in terms of all endpoints. Therefore, sufficient levels of pre-conception riboflavin, folate, and vitamin B12 are recommended for successful infertility treatment and pregnancy planning; further evidence is needed to confirm our conclusion."

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies among women conceiving with and without medical assistance provide strong evidence for a beneficial effect of B vitamins, particularly folate and vitamin B12, on fecundability and fertility. Moreover, recent work suggests that effects may be even more pronounced among women with menstrual cycle dysfunction (a common symptom of PCOS). Among PCOS women, intervention studies have demonstrated that folic acid supplementation may reduce homocysteine levels, potentially improve women's metabolic profiles, and possibly ameliorate some hallmark features of PCOS. Although none of these intervention studies have included fertility endpoints, it is possible that by reducing homocysteine levels (or other clinical/biochemical features) in PCOS women, there may be a downstream improvement in fertility outcomes. SUMMARY: There is growing evidence folate (and possibly vitamin B12) supplementation may be beneficial to fertility in women. Although most studies have not exclusively focused on women with PCOS, there is biological plausibility and some evidence that B vitamin supplementation may be even more important for improving reproductive health outcomes in PCOS women.",

All patients received high protein prescriptions of 30 kcal/kg/d by enteral nutrition. The intervention group (n = 40) received vitamin B complex, including thiamine (10 mg), riboflavin (4 mg), nicotinamide (40 mg), and dexpanthenol (6 mg). The control group received similar nutritional supports, except for group B vitamins. Assessments were carried out at baseline and after 2 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: : Vitamin B supplementation had no effects on the biochemical and pathological parameters including kidney function, arterial blood gas parameters, Glasgow coma scale, cell blood count, and serum electrolytes of the intervention group compared with the control group. The 30-day mortality was insignificantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (83.3% against 96.1%, P = 0.07).

Aside from calcium and vitamin D, B vitamins are a group of water-soluble vitamins that play a vital role in cell metabolism. In this review, current evidence on B vitamins and bone health is assessed. Clinical trials (interventions) indicate that treatment with B vitamins impact the concentrations of total plasma/serum homocysteine concentrations (tHcy); however, most studies have reported the lack of an effect of low homocysteine concentrations on bone turnover markers, bone mineral density or fracture risks. Current studies have been inconsistent in their reports on the role of B vitamins and homocysteine in bone health.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the effect of celecoxib and the combined vitamin complex of group B in comparison with meloxicam in patients with acute and chronic nonspecific lumbar pain (LP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The effectiveness of the effect on acute (44%; acute pain syndrome (APS)) and chronic (56%; chronic pain syndrome (CPS)) LP of moderate intensity (according to VAS/MPQ) (APS 5.7±2.3/2.13±0.67 points; CPS 5.2±2.8/1.47±0.61 points), the leading component of which is sensory sensations (when APS is lower than in CBS; Kr-W=6.15, p=0.04) and affective disorders in CPS (U=117.5, p=0.04) celecoxib without (APS 25%; CPS 75%) and with the addition of Neuromultivit (APS 36%; CPS 64%) and in comparison with meloxicam (APS 100%) against the background of basic therapy in 93 patients (61.3% women and 38.7% men; average age 49.9±9. years) with nonspecific LP pain syndrome in the lower back, with a low degree of severity of motor function (MF) disorders according to the ICF (2±1 points), due to spondyloarthrosis of the lumbosacral spine. RESULTS: It was found that celecoxib and meloxicam cause the same significant remitting decrease in the severity of APS and restoration of MF disorders in patients with APS, equally cause rare adverse events (gastropathy, increased blood pressure) in comorbid pathology. Celecoxib proved to be more effective in relieving CPS and improving MF (p<0.05), and the combination of celecoxib with Neuromultivit caused more pronounced relief of APS and CPS, restoration of MF (p<0.01). A steady decrease in the intensity of PS (1-2 points according to VAS), recovery of MF occurs only on the 10th-11th day of therapy (p<0.01), with complete relief of LP by day 21 only in 60.22% of cases. CONCLUSION: The results of the study confirm the benefits of celecoxib in combination with a vitamin complex for the relief of CPS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A combination of green tea, rhodiola and magnesium with B vitamins has previously been reported to significantly increase EEG resting state theta, attenuate subjective stress, anxiety and mood disturbance, and heighten subjective and autonomic arousal under acute psychosocial laboratory stress. Here we examine the capacity of green tea and rhodiola extract administered in combination or in isolation with magnesium and B vitamins to moderate spectral brain activity during attentional task performance under stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred moderately stressed adults received oral supplementation of (i) Mg + B vitamins + green tea + rhodiola; (ii) Mg + B vitamins + rhodiola; (iii) Mg + B vitamins + green tea; or (iv) placebo, in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03262376; 25/0817). Participants completed an attention switching and emotionally threatening attentional bias task after stress induction (Trier Social Stress Test). Spectral alpha and theta brain activity and event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during cognitive task performance by electroencephalogram (EEG; BioSemi ActiveTwo 64 channel). RESULTS: The combined treatment of Mg + B vitamins + green tea + rhodiola significantly increased frontal midline theta vs. placebo and rhodiola in isolation during the attention switching task, specifically in anticipation of a change in task performance parameter. The combined treatment also significantly increased contralateral theta activation in relation to viewing emotionally threatening images in the left (vs. placebo and rhodiola in isolation) and right parietal (vs. placebo) regions. Further, this treatment demonstrated significantly heightened ipsilateral left parietal theta activation in relation to viewing emotionally threatening images. The combined treatment attenuated a decrease in alpha power during the attentional bias task evident in comparator treatments, but this did not reach significance. No significant effects of treatments on behavioural performance or ERP were found. CONCLUSION: The combination of Mg + B vitamins + green tea + rhodiola increased spectral theta brain activity during the execution of two attentional tasks suggestive of a potential to increase attentional capacity under conditions of stress. Further examination of these ingredients in relation to attentional performance under stress is warranted to ascertain if functional benefits suggested by theta activation can be shown behaviourally."

Epidemiological studies do not always consistently use fasting or non-fasting blood samples or may lack information on the prandial status of the study participants. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a light breakfast on serum concentrations of selected metabolites and B-vitamins related to the one-carbon metabolism; i.e. the methionine-homocysteine cycle, the folate cycle, the choline oxidation pathway and the transsulfuration pathway. Sixty-three healthy adults (thirty-six women) with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 were included in the study. Blood was collected in the fasting state and 60 and 120 min after intake of a standardised breakfast consisting of white bread, margarine, white cheese, strawberry jam and orange juice (2218 kJ). The meal contained low amounts of choline, betaine, serine and vitamins B2, B3, B6, B9 and B12. Serum concentrations of total homocysteine, total cysteine, flavin mononucleotide, nicotinamide and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate were significantly decreased, and concentrations of choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine, cystathionine and folate were significantly increased following breakfast intake (P < 0·05). Our findings demonstrate that the intake of a light breakfast with low nutrient content affected serum concentrations of several metabolites and B-vitamins related to the one-carbon metabolism."

We conducted a systematic search, screening five electronic databases (Embase, Cochrane, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Medline) to find studies on the effectiveness and potential harm of B-vitamin therapy on cancer patients. Out of the 7465 search results, 11 RCTs about vitamin B6, B12 and B-vitamins in combination were included in this systematic review. A total of 1546 patients with diverse types of cancer were evaluated. Overall, most studies were of acceptable quality and reported consistent results. Studies examining the effectiveness of vitamin B6 reported that there is no significant impact on decreasing the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced side effects (e.g., hand-foot syndrome), the necessity of chemotherapy dose-modifications or improving patients' quality of life, tumor response/progression, and overall survival. Two studies reported that vitamin B12 could be effective in the alleviation of symptoms resulting from chemotherapy; it might decrease motor, sensory and pain symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. However, a combination of B vitamins may not reduce the incidence of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. All in all, the evidence on B-vitamins in cancer patients is low and supplementation cannot be recommended.",

This study was designed to examine the effects of supplementation with thiamine (B1), pyridoxine (B6), cobalamin (B12), folic acid (B9), and a combination of these vitamins on women with episodic migraine (EM). Methods: This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical trial conducted on 120 women with EM. The participants were divided into the 6 groups of B1 (n = 20), B6 (n = 20), B12 (n = 20), B9 (n = 20), vitamin B complex (n = 20), and placebo (n = 20). Subjects received 1 capsule daily for 12 weeks. As part of the baseline and post-intervention phases, paper-based headache diaries were used to record the number of abortive drugs consumed and the frequency of headache attacks, and the Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire (MIDAS) was used to assess migraine disability. Results: A 16-week study on women with EM revealed that the mean changes in the frequency of headache attacks decreased significantly in all vitamin groups in comparison with the placebo group (P < 0.001). In contrast to the placebo, there was also a significant improvement in the migraine disability score in each vitamin group (P < 0.001). The 12-week supplementation with vitamins B9, B1, B6, B12, and B complex also brought on a significant decrease in the use of abortive drugs compared to the placebo group (P = 0.032). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that B1, B6, B12, and B9, and a combination of these vitamins could be effective as an adjuvant in treatment and prophylaxis of EM. Further large trials with long-term follow-ups will be required to confirm our results."

METHODS: Informative treatment alone, B vitamin injections, oral cavity probiotics, and low-level laser therapy were evaluated and compared. The study included new patients diagnosed with burning mouth syndrome, who were randomly allocated into one of four treatment groups. The primary outcome was improvement in patient's quality of life as determined by a self-perceived Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) quality of life questionnaire before and after therapy. The secondary outcome was determination of mucosal symptom intensity according to visual analog scale (VAS) grading from 0 to 10. Data were submitted to statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients completed the study. Oral cavity probiotics and LLLT scores for OHIP-14 resulted in a statistically significant difference before and after therapy. Standardized effect sizes between OHIP scores before and after treatment were the greatest for patients who had received oral cavity probiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Oral cavity probiotics and LLLT were the most effective treatment for improvement in quality of life. Further investigation on a larger group of patients is required."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malnutrition, metabolism stress, inflammation, peripheral organs dysfunction, and B vitamins deficiency significantly contribute to the progression and mortality of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is unclear which blood biochemical indicators are most closely related to cognitive decline and B vitamins deficiency (thiamine, folate, vitamin B12) in patients with AD. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 206 AD patients recruited from six hospitals in China. Thiamine diphosphate (TDP), the bioactive form of thiamine, was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography fluoroscopy (HPLC) at a single center. Levels of biochemical indicators (except TDP) were measured by regular and standard laboratory tests in each hospital. Pearson's rank correlation analysis was used to assess relationships between B vitamins and biochemical indicators. T-test was used to compare the difference between ApoE ε4 and non-ApoE ε4 groups. Differences were considered statistically significant as P < 0.05. RESULTS: Among the biochemical results, in AD population, malnutrition indicators (erythrocyte, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and total protein) were most significantly associated with cognitive function, as was free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels which had been observed in previous study. Malnutrition and FT3 levels depend on age but not apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. Meanwhile, Among the B vitamins, TDP was the most significantly associated with malnutrition indicators and FT3. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that TDP reduction could be a modifiable risk factor for malnutrition and FT3 that contributed to cognitive decline in AD patients. Correcting thiamine metabolism could serve as an optional therapy target for AD treatment."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of B vitamins and vitamin D therapy in improving the standard treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. We also aimed to gather the evidence supporting the recommendations for supplementation in clinical practice. METHODS: Performed between March 2020 and September 2021, the main inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with patients ≥ 18 years old, both sexes, fulfilling target diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or mild to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms. In addition, the RCTs were included if the scales to assess the severity of the symptoms were standardized rating scales in psychiatric. Trials that reported diagnoses of schizophrenia, perinatal depression, bipolar depression, sleep disorders, eating disorders, cancer, and multiple sclerosis in association with any of the mentioned diagnoses were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 20 RCTs that matched all eligibility criteria, totaling 2,256 subjects, diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and depressive or anxiety symptoms. Supplementation with folic acid or L-methylfolate, B1, B12 or methylcobalamin, and vitamin D (in different doses and study duration) significantly decreased depression score scales by increasing response to standard pharmacological treatment or as monotherapy, including partial or complete remission. As for anxiety symptoms, the availability of results is limited to adjuvant vitamin D therapy. DISCUSSION: B vitamins and vitamin D associated with other compounds also showed significant results, so the improvement in symptoms cannot be attributed strictly to those. Our results suggest that intervention with B vitamins and/or vitamin D may be an effective and well-tolerated adjuvant strategy for improving the symptoms of depression and anxiety, according to the patient's clinical status and nutritional biomarkers.",

Although the therapeutic arsenal to face heart failure has been expanding, the relatively short life expectancy of HF patients is pushing towards novel therapeutic strategies. Heart failure is associated with drastic metabolic disorders, including severe myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction and systemic nutrient deprivation secondary to severe cardiac dysfunction. To date, no effective therapy has been developed to restore the cardiac energy metabolism of the failing myocardium, mainly due to the metabolic complexity and intertwining of the involved processes. Recent years have witnessed a growing scientific interest in natural molecules that play a pivotal role in energy metabolism with promising therapeutic effects against heart failure. Among these molecules, B vitamins are a class of water soluble vitamins that are directly involved in energy metabolism and are of particular interest since they are intimately linked to energy metabolism and HF patients are often B vitamin deficient. This review aims at assessing the value of B vitamin supplementation in the treatment of heart failure.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Optimal human milk (HM) B-vitamin concentrations remain undefined, especially in areas where undernutrition is prevalent. The impact of supplementation pre-conception through pregnancy on HM B-vitamin composition remains unknown. Methods: Human milk (HM) was collected at 2-weeks postpartum from 200 women in Guatemala, India, and Pakistan (the Women First Trial). The women were randomized to start a lipid-based nutrient supplement before conception, at end of the first trimester, or not at all; intervention continued until delivery. HM concentrations of eight B-vitamins and choline were assessed via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Maternal diet was assessed in early pregnancy, and infant growth followed through 6 months post-delivery. Results: Despite supplement exposure averaging 15.7 (pre-conception arm) and 6.0 months (prenatal arm), HM B-vitamins did not differ between arms, but site differences were evident. Guatemala had higher HM concentrations of vitamin B3 than Pakistan and India. Pakistan had higher HM concentrations of thiamin and vitamin B6 than India and Guatemala. Cohort average HM vitamin B2 (162 ± 79 μg/L) and B6 (31.8 ± 24.6 μg/L) fell below values defined as deficient in 81.5 and 85.5% of samples, potentially reflecting sampling procedures and timing. Maternal dietary intakes of only vitamin B6 and choline were associated with the corresponding concentrations in HM (p < 0.005). No HM B-vitamin concentrations were associated with infant growth. Conclusion: Prenatal supplementation for at least 6 months had no impact on HM B-vitamin concentrations at 2-weeks postpartum. Results suggest that the adequacy of HM composition was generally maintained, with potential exceptions of vitamin B2 and B6."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An open, observational, retrospective - prospective study involved 70 patients with acute lumbar dorsalgia. Two groups of 35 patients were formed, who were prescribed step therapy with Texared and Neurobion (group 1) and Amelotex and Milgamma (group 2). The groups of patients are comparable by gender (in group 1 - 25 (71%) women, in group 2 - 24 (69%), the average age is 50.1±10.5 and 52.8±12.0 years, respectively. The groups are comparable in the nature and severity of clinical symptoms, but not homogeneous in the nature of concomitant diseases. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In two groups, there was a comparable improvement in the condition after treatment according to the Oswestry and Roland-Morris questionnaires, an increase in the quality of sleep by the 10th day of observation. In the 1st group, the decrease in pain syndrome by VAS is more pronounced: by the 3rd visit, the decrease is 7.5 points more than in the 2nd group (p<0.05). In group 1, by the 2nd visit, the median pain intensity for VAS decreased by 10 points (p<0.05), by the 3rd - by 30 points (p<0.05). In group 1, the improvement in general well-being according to the assessment of the patient and the doctor was more pronounced (p<0.05). Evaluation of the effectiveness of both types of therapy demonstrated comparable results, both in the opinion of the doctor and in the opinion of the patient. The results of treatment in both groups are comparable in terms of satisfaction with treatment and ease of use according to the patient's assessment. In group 1, there was less pain of intramuscular administration of the drug. 32 (91%) patients of group 1 positively assessed the convenience of using the proposed treatment regimen. No significant adverse events were detected in the two groups.",

To validate this finding, we pooled data of this trial with that of a similar B-vitamin trial (VITACOG) to examine the effectiveness of B vitamins and their interactions with aspirin in improving global cognitive functioning and slowing brain atrophy in older people with MCI. DESIGN: Pooled post-hoc analyses of two randomized placebo-controlled trials. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 545 older people with MCI were included in the study. INTERVENTION: Placebo or B-vitamin supplements (vitamin B12, folic acid with or without vitamin B6) for 24 months. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the Clinical Dementia Rating scale-global score (CDR-global). The secondary outcomes were CDR-sum of box score (CDR-SOB), memory Z-score, executive function Z-score, and whole brain atrophy rate. RESULTS: 71 (26.2%) and 83 (30.3%) subjects in the active and placebo group respectively were aspirin users. Overall, B vitamins reduced whole brain atrophy rate significantly (P = 0.003), but did not have significant effect on CDR-global, CDR-SOB, memory and executive function. Aspirin use had significant negative interaction effects on B vitamins in CDR-global and CDR-SOB (Beta = 0.993, P = 0.038, and Beta = 0.583, P = 0.009, respectively), but not in memory or executive function Z-scores. Among aspirin non-users, B-vitamin group subjects had more favourable changes in CDR-global and CDR-SOB (P = 0.019 and 0.057, respectively). B vitamins significantly slowed brain atrophy in aspirin non-users (P = 0.001), but not in aspirin users, though the interaction term was not significant (Beta = 0.192, P = 0.276). CONCLUSION: In older people with MCI, B vitamins had significantly favourable effects on global cognitive functioning and whole brain atrophy rate in those who were not taking aspirin, but not in aspirin users.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether B vitamin treatment was sufficient to reduce cognitive impairment associated with high-fat diets in rats and to modulate transketolase (TK) expression and activity. METHODS: To test this, we separated 50 rats into five groups that were either fed a standard chow diet (controls) or a high-fat diet (experimental groups H0, H1, H2, and H3). H0 group animals received no additional dietary supplementation, while H1 group animals were administered 100 mg/kg body weight (BW) thiamine, 100 mg/kg BW riboflavin, and 250 mg/kg BW niacin each day, and group H2 animals received daily doses of 100 mg/kg BW pyridoxine, 100 mg/kg BW cobalamin, and 5 mg/kg BW folate. Animals in the H3 group received the B vitamin regimens administered to both H1 and H2 each day. RESULTS: Over time, group H0 exhibited greater increases in BW and fat mass relative to other groups. When spatial and memory capabilities in these animals were evaluated via conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and Morris Water Maze (MWM), we found B vitamin treatment was associated with significant improvements relative to untreated H0 controls. Similarly, B vitamin supplementation was associated with elevated TK expression in erythrocytes and hypothalamus of treated animals relative to those in H0 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Together, these findings suggest B vitamin can modulate hypothalamic TK activity to reduce the severity of cognitive deficits in a rat model of obesity. As such, B vitamin supplementation may be a beneficial method for reducing cognitive dysfunction in clinical settings associated with high-fat diets.",

B vitamin therapy lowers homocysteine and slows brain atrophy and cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). OBJECTIVE:: Examine metals and silicon as predictors of cognition/brain atrophy in MCI, their interaction with homocysteine and cysteine, and how B vitamins affect these relationships. METHODS:: MCI participants (n = 266, 77.6-year-old, 60.7% female) in VITACOG trial were randomized to receive daily folic acid (0.8 mg)/vitamin B12 (0.5 mg)/vitamin B6 (20 mg) (n = 133) or placebo for two years. At baseline and end-of-study, cranial MRIs were obtained from 168 participants, cognition was analyzed by neuropsychological tests, and serum iron, copper, arsenic, aluminum, and silicon quantified by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry in 196 participants. Data were analyzed by bivariate and multiple regression. RESULTS:: Baseline iron, cysteine, and homocysteine were significantly associated with brain atrophy rate. Homocysteine effects on brain atrophy rate were modified by iron and cysteine. At baseline, iron, copper, aluminum, and silicon were significantly associated with one or more domains of cognition: semantic memory, verbal episodic memory, attention/processing speed, and executive function. At end-of-study, baseline iron, copper, aluminum, and silicon predicted cognition in at least one domain: semantic memory, verbal episodic memory, visuospatial episodic memory, attention/processing speed, and global cognition in the placebo but not the B vitamin group. CONCLUSION:: Disparate effects of serum iron, copper, aluminum, silicon, and homocysteine on cognition and brain atrophy in MCI suggest that cognitive impairment is independent of brain atrophy. These factors showed domain-specific associations with cognition, which were abrogated by B vitamin therapy.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Elevation of homocysteine (Hcy) levels is well-established as a risk factor for dementia, yet controversy exists regarding whether B-vitamin-mediated reduction of homocysteine levels can benefit cognitive function. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether B vitamin supplementation can reduce the risk of cognitive decline and incident dementia. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were systematically searched for articles published from the inception dates to March 1, 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) were included if B vitamins were supplied to investigate their effect on the rate of cognitive decline. Cohort studies investigating dietary intake of B vitamins and the risk of incident dementia were eligible. Cross-sectional studies comparing differences in levels of B vitamins and Hcy were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently performed data extraction and assessed the study quality. DATA ANALYSIS: Random-effect or fixed-effect models, depending on the degree of heterogeneity, were performed to calculate mean differences (MDs), hazard ratios (HRs), and odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of 95 studies with 46175 participants (25 RCTs, 20 cohort studies, and 50 cross-sectional studies) were included in this meta-analysis. This meta-analysis supports that B vitamins can benefit cognitive function as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination score changes (6155 participants; MD, 0.14, 95%CI 0.04 to 0.23), and this result was also significant in studies where placebo groups developed cognitive decline (4211 participants; MD, 0.16, 95%CI 0.05 to 0.26), suggesting that B vitamins slow cognitive decline. For the > 12 months interventional period stratum, B vitamin supplementation decreased cognitive decline (3814 participants; MD, 0.15, 95%CI 0.05 to 0.26) compared to placebo; no such outcome was detected for the shorter interventional stratum (806 participants; MD, 0.18, 95%CI -0.25 to 0.61). In the non-dementia population, B vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline (3431 participants; MD, 0.15, 95%CI 0.04 to 0.25) compared to placebo; this outcome was not found for the dementia population (642 participants; MD, 0.20, 95%CI -0.35 to 0.75). Lower folate levels (but not B12 or B6 deficiency) and higher Hcy levels were significantly associated with higher risks of dementia (folate: 6654 participants; OR, 1.76, 95%CI 1.24 to 2.50; Hcy: 12665 participants; OR, 2.09, 95%CI 1.60 to 2.74) and cognitive decline (folate: 4336 participants; OR, 1.26, 95%CI 1.02 to 1.55; Hcy: 6149 participants; OR, 1.19, 95%CI 1.05 to 1.34). Among the population without dementia aged 50 years and above, the risk of incident dementia was significantly decreased among individuals with higher intake of folate (13529 participants; HR, 0.61, 95%CI 0.47 to 0.78), whereas higher intake of B12 or B6 was not associated with lower dementia risk. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that B vitamin supplementation is associated with slowing of cognitive decline, especially in populations who received early intervention and intervention of long duration; the study also indicates that higher intake of dietary folate, but not B12 or B6, is associated with a reduced risk of incident dementia in non-dementia aged population. Given the prevalence of dementia cases in many countries with aging populations, public health policies should be introduced to ensure that subgroups of the population at risk have an adequate B vitamin status.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identification of modifiable risk factors that affect cognitive decline is important for the development of preventive and treatment strategies. Status of paraoxonase 1 (PON1), a high-density lipoprotein-associated enzyme, may play a role in the development of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: We tested a hypothesis that PON1 status predicts cognition in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Individuals with MCI (n = 196, 76.8-years-old, 60% women) participating in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial (VITACOG) were assigned to receive a daily dose of folic acid (0.8 mg), vitamin B12 (0.5 mg) and B6 (20 mg) (n = 95) or placebo (n = 101) for 2 years. Cognition was analyzed by neuropsychological tests. Brain atrophy was quantified in a subset of participants (n = 168) by MRI. PON1 status, including PON1 Q192R genotype, was determined by quantifying enzymatic activity of PON1 using paraoxon and phenyl acetate as substrates. RESULTS: In the placebo group, baseline phenylacetate hydrolase (PhAcase) activity of PON1 (but not paraoxonase activity or PON1 Q192R genotype) was significantly associated with global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE; Telephone Inventory for Cognitive Status-modified, TICS-m), verbal episodic memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-revised: Total Recall, HVLT-TR; Delayed Recall, HVLT-DR), and attention/processing speed (Trail Making A and Symbol Digits Modalities Test, SDMT) at the end of study. In addition to PhAcase, baseline iron and triglycerides predicted MMSE, baseline fatty acids predicted SDMT, baseline anti-N-Hcy-protein autoantibodies predicted TICS-m, SDMT, Trail Making A, while BDNF V66M genotype predicted HVLT-TR and HVLT-DR scores at the end of study. B-vitamins abrogated associations of PON1 and other variables with cognition. CONCLUSION: PON1 is a new factor associated with impaired cognition that can be ameliorated by B-vitamins in individuals with MCI.",

Green tea and rhodiola have been shown to modulate EEG oscillatory brain activity associated with relaxation and stress perception. The combined capacity of these ingredients to confer protective effects under conditions of acute stress has yet to be examined. We tested the hypothesis that a combination of Mg (with B vitamins) + green tea + rhodiola would acutely moderate the effects of stress exposure. METHODS: A double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group design was employed (Clinicaltrials.gov:NCT03262376; 25/0817). One hundred moderately stressed adults received oral supplementation of either (i) Mg + B vitamins + green tea + rhodiola; (ii) Mg + B vitamins + rhodiola; (iii) Mg + B vitamins + green tea; or (iv) placebo. After supplementation participants were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test. The effects of the study treatments on electroencephalogram (EEG) resting state alpha and theta, subjective state/mood, blood pressure, heart rate variability and salivary cortisol responses after acute stress exposure were assessed. RESULTS: The combined treatment significantly increased EEG resting state theta (p < .02) - considered indicative of a relaxed, alert state, attenuated subjective stress, anxiety and mood disturbance, and heightened subjective and autonomic arousal (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Mg, B vitamins, rhodiola and green tea extracts are a promising combination of ingredients that may enhance coping capacity and offer protection from the negative effects of stress exposure.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03262376.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether a modestly elevated homocysteine level is causally associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease remains unestablished. We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to assess the associations of circulating total homocysteine (tHcy) and B vitamin levels with cardiovascular diseases in the general population. METHODS: Independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with tHcy (n = 14), folate (n = 2), vitamin B6 (n = 1), and vitamin B12 (n = 14) at the genome-wide significance level were selected as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for 12 cardiovascular endpoints were obtained from genetic consortia, the UK Biobank study, and the FinnGen consortium. RESULTS: Higher genetically predicted circulating tHcy levels were associated with an increased risk of stroke. For each one standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, the odds ratio (OR) was 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03, 1.21; p = 0.008) for any stroke, 1.26 (95% CI, 1.05, 1.51; p = 0.013) for subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03, 1.21; p = 0.011) for ischemic stroke. Higher genetically predicted folate levels were associated with decreased risk of coronary artery disease (ORSD, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78, 1.00, p = 0.049) and any stroke (ORSD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76, 0.97, p = 0.012). Genetically predicted increased vitamin B6 levels were associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke (ORSD, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81, 0.97, p = 0.009). None of these associations persisted after multiple testing correction. There was no association between genetically predicted vitamin B12 and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals suggestive evidence that B vitamin therapy and lowering of tHcy may reduce the risk of stroke, particularly subarachnoid hemorrhage and ischemic stroke.",

The anticancer activity of carboplatin arises from interacting with DNA and inducing programmed cell death. However, such interactions may occur with other chemical compounds, such as vitamins containing aromatic rings with lone-pair orbitals, which reduces the anti-cancer effect of carboplatin. The most important aspect of the conducted research was related to the evaluation of carboplatin affinity to vitamins from the B group and the potential impact of such interactions on the reduction of therapeutic capabilities of carboplatin in anticancer therapy. Realized computations, including estimation of Gibbs Free Energies, allowed for the identification of the most reactive molecule, namely vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate). In this case, the computational estimations indicating carboplatin reactivity were confirmed by spectrophotometric measurements.",

      "abstract": "Elevated plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are a recognized risk factor for stroke. This relationship represents one aspect of the debated `Hcy hypothesis'. Elevated Hcy may be an independent and treatable cause of atherosclerosis and thrombotic vascular diseases. Further observations indicate that proper dietary supplementation with B-vitamins decreases total plasma Hcy concentrations and may be an effective intervention for stroke prevention. Metabolic vitamin B12 deficiency is a nutritional determinant of total Hcy and stroke risk. Genetic factors may link B vitamins with stroke severity due to the impact on Hcy metabolism of polymorphism in the genes coding for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, methionine-synthase, methionine synthase reductase, and cystathionine β-synthase. Several meta-analyses of large randomized controlled trials exist. However, they are not completely in agreement about B vitamins' role, particularly folic acid levels, vitamin B12, and B6, in lowering the homocysteine concentrations in people at high stroke risk. A very complex relationship exists between Hcy and B vitamins, and several factors appear to modify the preventive effects of B vitamins in stroke. This review highlights the regulating factors of the active role of B vitamins active in stroke prevention. Also, inputs for further large, well-designed studies, for specific, particularly sensitive subgroups are given.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is common in patients with diseases that are in turn associated with deficiency of the B-vitamins, and vitamin treatment has shown mixed results. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis studied the association between PN/pain and B-vitamin biomarkers and investigated whether vitamin treatment can ameliorate the symptoms. PubMed and Web of Science were searched according to the study protocol. RESULTS: A total of 46 observational and seven interventional studies were identified and included in the data synthesis. The presence of PN was associated with lowered B12 levels (pooled estimate [95% CIs] = 1.51 [1.23-1.84], n = 34, Cochran Q Test I2  = 43.3%, p = 0.003) and elevated methylmalonic acid (2.53 [1.39-4.60], n = 9, I2  = 63.8%, p = 0.005) and homocysteine (3.48 [2.01-6.04], n = 15, I2  = 70.6%, p < 0.001). B12 treatment (vs. the comparators) showed a non-significant association with symptom improvement (1.36 (0.66-2.79), n = 4, I2  = 28.9%). Treatment with B1 was associated with a significant improvement in symptoms (5.34 [1.87-15.19], n = 3, I2  = 64.6%, p = 0.059). Analysis of seven trials combined showed a non-significant higher odds ratio for improvement under treatment with the B-vitamins (2.58 [0.98-6.79], I2  = 80.0%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PN is associated with lowered plasma vitamin B12 and elevated methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. Overall, interventional studies have suggested that B-vitamins could improve symptoms of PN. Available trials have limitations and generally did not investigate vitamin status prior to treatment. Well-designed studies, especially in non-diabetes PN, are needed. This meta-analysis is registered at PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020144917).",

The aim of this review was to summarize the current evidence for the efficacy of B vitamin therapy in diabetic patients with neuropathy. COMMENT: We screened the English literature for clinical studies evaluating B vitamins as a therapy for pain and neuropathy in diabetic patients. We selected 43 relevant studies for qualitative analysis based on our selection criteria. Our survey of the literature revealed substantive heterogeneity with respect to efficacies of reported outcomes, as well as study design. Most beneficial outcomes were reported against baseline measures, with few positive comparisons against placebo. This highlights the need for larger, placebo-controlled studies. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: B vitamins should be considered a plausible therapy for diabetic neuropathy, but its overall efficacy remains uncertain and requires further study.",

      "abstract": "Diallyl sulfide (DAS) and diallyl disulfide (DADS), two constituents of garlic, can inhibit quorum sensing (QS) systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the differences in the mechanism of QS inhibition between DAS and DADS, and the functional chemical groups of these sulfides that contribute in QS inhibition have not been elucidated yet. We assumed that the sulfide group might play a key role in QS inhibition. To prove this hypothesis and to clarify these unsolved problems, in this study, we synthesized diallyl ether (DAE), and compared and investigated the effects of DAS and DAE on the growth and production of virulence factors, including Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), elastase and pyocyanin, of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Transcriptome analysis and qRT-PCR were used to compare and analyse the differentially expressed genes between the different treatment groups (DAS, DAE and control). The results indicated that DAS did not affect the growth dynamics of P. aeruginosa PAO1; however, DAS inhibited transcription of most of the QS system genes, including lasR, rhlI/rhlR and pqsABCDE/pqsR; thus, biosynthesis of the signal molecules C4 -HSL (encoded by rhlI) and PQS (encoded by pqsABCDE) was inhibited. Furthermore, DAS inhibited the transcription of virulence genes regulated by the QS systems, including rhlABC, lasA, lasB, lecA and phzAB, phzDEFG, phzM and phzS that encode for rhamnolipid, exoprotease, elastase, lectin and pyocyanin biosynthesis respectively. DAS also enhanced the expression of the key genes involved in the biosynthesis of three B vitamins: folate, thiamine and riboflavin. In conclusion, DAS suppressed the production of some virulence factors toxic to the host and enhanced the production of some nutrition factors beneficial to the host. These actions of DAS may be due to its thioether group. These findings would be significant for development of an effective drug to control the virulence and pathogenesis of the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa.",

Dietary supplementation with ad hoc fortified foods seems an appealing strategy to counteract inflammaging. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of elderly-tailored fortified milk on inflammaging and different health parameters. METHODS: A double-blind randomized cross-over study was performed on forty-eight volunteers aged 63-80 years. The fortified milk was enriched with ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA; docosahexaenoic acid, DHA), vitamins (25-hydroxyvitamin D, E, C, B6, B9, B12), and trace elements (zinc, selenium). The two intervention periods lasted for 12 weeks, with a 16-week washout intermission. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, the consumption of fortified milk increased the circulating levels of different micronutrients, including vitamins and the ω-3 index of erythrocyte membranes. Conversely, it reduced the amount of arachidonic acid, homocysteine, and ω-6/ω-3 ratio. CONCLUSION: Twelve-week daily consumption of adhoc fortified milk has an overall positive impact on different health parameters related to inflammaging in the elderly.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between vitamins of the methionine-homocysteine (Hcys) cycle (B6, B12 and folate) and Hcys with metabolic syndrome (MetS) among Mesoamerican children and their adult parents. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study. Exposures were plasma vitamins B6 and B12 concentrations, erythrocyte folate and plasma Hcys. In children, the outcome was a continuous metabolic risk score calculated through sex- and age standardisation of waist circumference, the homoeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum HDL-cholesterol and serum TAG. In parents, the outcome was the prevalence of MetS according to the Adult Treatment Panel III Criteria. We estimated mean differences in the metabolic risk score and prevalence ratios of MetS between quartiles of the exposures using multivariable-adjusted linear and Poisson regression models, respectively. SETTING: Capital cities of Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica and Chiapas State in Mexico. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 237 school-aged children and 524 parents. RESULTS: Among children, vitamin B12 was inversely associated with the metabolic risk score (quartiles 4-1 adjusted difference = -0·13; 95 % CI: -0·21, -0·04; Ptrend = 0·008) through MAP, HDL-cholesterol and TAG. In contrast, folate was positively associated with the metabolic risk score (quartiles 4-1 adjusted difference = 0·11; 95 % CI: 0·01, 0·20; Ptrend = 0·02). In adults, vitamin B6 was inversely associated with MetS prevalence, whereas vitamin B12 and folate were positively related to this outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamins of the methionine-Hcys cycle are associated with MetS in different directions. The associations differ between children and adults.",

Dietary deficiencies in B9 and B12, or genetic polymorphisms that influence the activity of enzymes involved in the folate or methionine cycles, are known to cause developmental defects, impair cognitive function, or block normal blood production. Nutritional deficiencies have historically been treated with dietary supplementation or high-dose parenteral administration that can reverse symptoms in the majority of cases. Elevated levels of these vitamins have more recently been shown to correlate with immune dysfunction, cancer, and increased mortality. Therapies that specifically target one-carbon metabolism are therefore currently being explored for the treatment of immune disorders and cancer. In this review, we will highlight recent studies aimed at elucidating the role of folate, B12, and methionine in one-carbon metabolism during normal cellular processes and in the context of disease progression.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin deficiency causes classical deficiency diseases such as beriberi and rickets. Vitamin insufficiency, which is milder than deficiency, is a risk for various chronic diseases, but its significance has not been recognized in Japan. Vitamin D insufficiency is quite common in Japan, and a serious risk for osteoporotic fracture through its unbeneficial effect on bone and muscle. Insufficiency of B vitamins has been little studied. However, hyperhomocysteinemia caused by the insufficiency of vitamin B12 or folate is a risk for cardiovascular disease, osteoporotic fracture, and cognitive impairment. Additionally, we have recently reported that vitamin B1 insufficiency is a risk for heart failure in the elderly. The effect of improvement of nutritional status including vitamins is less marked compared to drug treatment, but it costs far less, and is suited for the primary prevention of diseases. Randomized controlled trial is considered the study with the most robust evidence in the evaluation of drug treatment, but more emphasis should be put on the well-designed cohort studies in evaluating the role of nutrients. Vitamin insufficiency is quite prevalent, and vitamin requirement is much higher for its prevention than for the prevention of deficiency."

      "abstract": "Symbionts can regulate animal reproduction in multiple ways, but the underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms remain largely unknown. The presence of multiple lineages of maternally inherited, intracellular symbionts (the primary and secondary symbionts) in terrestrial arthropods is widespread in nature. However, the biological, metabolic, and evolutionary role of co-resident secondary symbionts for hosts is poorly understood. The bacterial symbionts Hamiltonella and Arsenophonus have very high prevalence in two globally important pests, the whiteflies Bemisia tabaci and Trialeurodes vaporariorum, respectively. Both symbionts coexist with the primary symbiont Portiera in the same host cell (bacteriocyte) and are maternally transmitted. We found that elimination of both Hamiltonella and Arsenophonous by antibiotic treatment reduced the percentage of female offspring in whiteflies. Microsatellite genotyping and cytogenetic analysis revealed that symbiont deficiency inhibited fertilization in whiteflies, leading to more haploid males with one maternal allele, which is consistent with distorted sex ratio in whiteflies. Quantification of essential amino acids and B vitamins in whiteflies indicated that symbiont deficiency reduced B vitamin levels, and dietary B vitamin supplementation rescued fitness of whiteflies. This study, for the first time, conclusively demonstrates that these two intracellular symbionts affect sex ratios in their whitefly hosts by regulating fertilization and supplying B vitamins. Our results reveal that both symbionts have the convergent function of regulating reproduction in phylogenetically-distant whitefly species. The 100% frequency, the inability of whiteflies to develop normally without their symbiont, and rescue with B vitamins suggests that both symbionts may be better considered co-primary symbionts.",

This study aims to investigate the clinical relevance of B-vitamins and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on OCM-related genes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A total of 322 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients who received rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone-based immunochemotherapy were recruited into this study. The serum levels of B-vitamins (folate, vitamin B2 [riboflavin], vitamin B6 [pyridoxal 5'-phosphate], and vitamin B12 [cobalamin]), as well as SNPs on methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, methionine synthase (MTR), MTR reductase (MTRR) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH) genes, were assessed at diagnosis. The prognostic values were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression methods. Overall, the low serum concentration of folate and vitamin B2, as well as the presence of CTH1364 TT genotype, were significantly associated with poor treatment response in DLBCL. Multivariate analysis indicated that compared with patients in the medium and high serum folate tertiles, low serum folate tertile patients had both significantly inferior progression-free survival (P = .033, Tertile 2 vs Tertile 1, and P = .031, Tertile 3 vs Tertile 1) and overall survival time (P < .001, Tertile 2 vs Tertile 1, and P = .001, Tertile 3 vs Tertile 1).

      "abstract": "Hypertension is the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide, contributing to over 9 million deaths per annum, predominantly owing to cardiovascular disease. The association of obesity, physical inactivity and alcohol with elevated blood pressure (BP) is firmly established. Weight loss or other dietary strategies, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, have been shown to be effective in lowering BP. Additionally, specific nutrients are recognised to contribute to BP, with higher sodium intake linked with an increased risk of hypertension, while potassium is associated with a reduced risk of hypertension. Of note, emerging evidence has identified a novel role for one-carbon metabolism and the related B vitamins, particularly riboflavin, in BP. Specifically in adults genetically at risk of developing hypertension, owing to the common C677T polymorphism in MTHFR, supplemental riboflavin (co-factor for MTHFR) was shown in randomised trials to lower systolic BP by up to 13 mmHg. A BP response to intervention of this magnitude could have important clinical impacts, given that a reduction in systolic BP of 10 mmHg is estimated to decrease stroke risk by 40%. This review aims to explore the factors contributing to hypertension across the lifecycle and to critically evaluate the evidence supporting a role for nutrition, particularly folate-related B vitamins, in BP and risk of hypertension. In addition, gaps in our current knowledge that warrant future research in this area, will be identified.",

      "abstract": "A growing body of research has indicated a role for B vitamins in depression, with some previous studies suggesting that B vitamin status in patients with depression can impact on antidepressant response. Here we aimed to investigate B vitamin plasma concentrations in medicated patients with depression (n ​= ​94) compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n ​= ​57), and in patients with depression after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in a real-world clinical setting. Our results show that nicotinamide (vitamin B3), N1-methylnicotinamide (vitamin B3 metabolite), and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP; vitamin B6) concentrations were significantly reduced in patients with depression compared to controls. The Cohen's d effect sizes for nicotinamide, N1-methylnicotinamide, and PLP were moderate-large (-0.47, -0.51, and -0.59, respectively), and likely to be of clinical relevance. Functional biomarkers of vitamin B6 status (PAr index, 3-hydroxykynurenine: hydroxyanthranilic acid ratio, 3-hydroxykynurenine: xanthurenic acid ratio, and HKr) were elevated in depressed patients compared to controls, suggestive of reduced vitamin B6 function. Over 30% of the patient cohort were found to have low to deficient PLP concentrations, and exploratory analyses revealed that these patients had higher IL-6 and CRP concentrations compared to patients with PLP levels within the normal range. Treatment with ECT did not alter B vitamin concentrations, and B vitamin concentrations were not associated with depression severity or the therapeutic response to ECT. Overall, reduced plasma PLP, nicotinamide, and N1-methylnicotinamide concentrations could have wide ranging effects on pathways and systems implicated in depression. Further studies are required to understand the reasons why patients with depression present with low plasma B vitamin concentrations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) continues to be a major challenge, and underlying mechanisms of DNP remain elusive. We investigated treatment effects of B vitamins on DPN- and DNP-associated alterations of neurochemical signaling in the nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and the spinal cord in rats. METHODS: DNP was produced in male, adult, Sprague Dawley rats by single i.p. streptozotocin (STZ). Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze protein expressions in DRG and ELISA to measure the proinflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord. Behaviorally expressed DNP was determined by measuring the sensitivity of hindpaw skin to mechanical and thermal stimulation. RESULTS: There were 87.5% (77/88) rats which developed high blood glucose within 1-2 weeks following STZ injection. Of which, 70.13% (n = 54/77) animals exhibited DNP manifested as mechanical allodynia and/or thermal hyperalgesia. Intraperitoneal administration of vitamins B1/B6/B12 (100/100/2 mg/kg, one or multiple doses) significantly attenuated DNP without affecting the blood glucose. Expressions of P2X3 and TRPV1 in CGRP-positive and IB4-positive DRG neurons as well as the interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and nerve growth factor in the lumbar spinal cord were greatly increased in DNP rats. Such DNP-associated neurochemical alterations were also greatly suppressed by the B-vitamin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: B-vitamin treatment can greatly suppress chronic DNP and DNP-associated increased activities of P2X3 and TRPV1 in DRG and the spinal proinflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of DNP. Systematic administration of B vitamins can be a strategy for DNP management in clinic.",

The aim of this review was to determine the effects of diclofenac combined with TPC compared with diclofenac monotherapy for low back pain (LBP) management. METHODS: We searched for randomized clinical trials on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane databases of records of clinical trials, among other sources. We evaluated the risk of bias regarding randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases. A random-effects meta-analysis to examine patients with acute LBP (N = 1,108 adults) was performed, along with a subsequent sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Five studies in patients with LBP were included in the qualitative synthesis. Four of these studies in acute LBP were included in the first meta-analysis. A sensitivity test based on risk of bias (three moderate- to high-quality studies) found that the combination therapy of diclofenac plus TPC was associated with a significant reduction in the duration of treatment (around 50%) compared with diclofenac monotherapy (odds ratio = 2.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.59 to 3.13, P < 0.00001). We found no differences in the safety profile and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrated that combination therapy of diclofenac with TPC might have an analgesic superiority compared with diclofenac monotherapy in acute LBP. However, there is not enough evidence to recommend this therapy in other types of pain due to the scarcity of high-quality studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurotropic B vitamins play crucial roles as coenzymes and beyond in the nervous system. Particularly vitamin B1 (thiamine), B6 (pyridoxine), and B12 (cobalamin) contribute essentially to the maintenance of a healthy nervous system. Their importance is highlighted by many neurological diseases related to deficiencies in one or more of these vitamins, but they can improve certain neurological conditions even without a (proven) deficiency. AIM: This review focuses on the most important biochemical mechanisms, how they are linked with neurological functions and what deficits arise from malfunctioning of these pathways. DISCUSSION: We discussed the main role of B Vitamins on several functions in the peripheral and central nervous system (PNS and CNS) including cellular energetic processes, antioxidative and neuroprotective effects, and both myelin and neurotransmitter synthesis. We also provide an overview of possible biochemical synergies between thiamine, pyridoxine, and cobalamin and discuss by which major roles each of them may contribute to the synergy and how these functions are inter-related and complement each other. CONCLUSION: Taking into account the current knowledge on the neurotropic vitamins B1, B6, and B12, we conclude that a biochemical synergy becomes apparent in many different pathways in the nervous system, particularly in the PNS as exemplified by their combined use in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy.",

However, whether this is a causal effect of these B-vitamins on obesity risk remains unclear and evidence in older individuals is scarce. This study aimed to assess the role of B-vitamin supplementation and levels on body composition in older individuals. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 2919 participants aged ≥ 65 years with elevated homocysteine levels. The intervention comprised a 2-year supplementation with a combination of folic acid (400 µg) and vitamin B12 (500 µg), or with placebo. Serum folate, vitamin-B12, active vitamin-B12 (HoloTC), methylmalonic acid (MMA), and anthropometrics were measured at baseline and after 2 years of follow-up. Dietary intake of folate and vitamin-B12 was measured at baseline in a subsample (n = 603) using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Fat mass index (FMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) were assessed with Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses showed that a 1 nmol/L higher serum folate was associated with a 0.021 kg/m2 lower BMI (95% CI - 0.039; - 0.004). Higher HoloTC (per pmol/L log-transformed) was associated with a 0.955 kg/m2 higher FMI (95% CI 0.262; 1.647), and higher MMA (per μgmol/L) was associated with a 1.108 kg/m2 lower FMI (95% CI - 1.899; - 0.316). However, random allocation of B-vitamins did not have a significant effect on changes in BMI, FMI or FFMI during 2 years of intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Although observational data suggested that folate and vitamin B12 status are associated with body composition, random allocation of a supplement with both B-vitamins combined versus placebo did not confirm an effect on BMI or body composition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cisplatin (CisPt) has a well-recognized anticancer activity by interacting with DNA and inducing programmed cell death. However, theoretical studies performed on the molecular level suggest that such nonspecific interactions can also take place with many competitive compounds, such as vitamins containing aromatic rings with lone-pair orbitals. OBJECTIVE: This work is a theoretical study on the initial Pt-N7(N1) bond formation with vitamins from B group and their comparison with values characterizing native purines. METHODS: Geometries of studied structures were optimized with an aid of Gaussian 09 using the B3LYP functional with the 6-31G** basis set. Atomic orbitals of platinum were represented by the lanl2dz basis. Solvation free energies were evaluated by a self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) approach. A dielectric constant of 78 for water was used in the PCM continuum model computations along with radii Bondii. RESULTS: The affinities of mono-aqua cis~[Pt(NH3)2Cl(H2O)]+ and di-aqua cis~ [Pt(NH3)2(H2O)2]2+ derivatives of Cisplatinum toward compounds belonging to the group of eight B vitamins were studied and compared to interactions with canonical purines. All the values of ΔGr unambiguously indicate that reactions with cisPt-diaqua are more preferable, but the comparison of ΔGr values obtained for compounds from vitamin B group and the ones characterizing complexes created by Guanine molecules indicates higher affinity of cisPt monomers toward purines. CONCLUSION: Based on the observations, the regular intake of vitamin-rich beetroot or carrot juices is strongly discouraged during anticancer therapy using CisPt drug. To confirm the results of the performed computational study, detailed clinical trials should be performed.",

Hence, the significance of the present preliminary investigation was to explore a noninvasive treatment strategy against sodium arsenite (As3+) by the use of a hydroethanolic extract of Moringa oleifera (MO) seed. Arsenic treatment (10 mg/kg body-weight) in animals showed significant level of oxidative stress as evidenced by increased serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated dienes (CD) and reduced level of non-protein thiol (NPSH). A significant diminution in the activities of enzymatic antioxidants was noted in As3+-treated rats. As3+ treatment showed a lengthy phase of metestrous in animals followed by significantly diminished ovarian steroidogenesis, increased ovarian follicular degeneration and distortion of uterine tissue histomorphology. In addition, there was a significant depletion of Vitamin-B9 (folate) and B12 following As3+ ingestion. The levels of circulating TNF-α, homocysteine (Hcy), uterine-IL-6, and liver metallothionein (MT-1) were significantly elevated in arsenic treated rats. MO at a dose of 100 mg/kg body-weight could successfully mitigate the uterine ROS generation by maintaining the uterine antioxidant status in As3+- treated rats. This seed extract prevented the deterioration of As3+-mediated ovarian-steroidogenesis and ovarian and uterine histoarchitecture significantly. B9 and B12 levels were also improved following the ingestion of the MO extract in arsenicated animals. Elevation of Hcy, TNF-α and IL-6 was also prevented by this MO seed extract in As3+-treated rats. A further increase of MT-1 level was achieved after MO ingestion in As3+-treated rats. Here, the alleviation of arsenic toxicity might involve via the regulation of the components of S-adenosine methionine (SAM) pool and MT-1.",

When expressed per unit of dry matter intake (DMI), floury treatments increased duodenal flow and apparent ruminal synthesis of niacin and folates but tended to increase apparent degradation of thiamin in the rumen. Duodenal flow of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folates, and vitamin B12, expressed per unit of DMI, decreased with an increase in particle size. Similarly, apparent degradation of thiamin and riboflavin was greater and apparent synthesis of niacin, folates, and vitamin B12 was reduced when cows were fed coarser dry corn grain particles. Neither endosperm type nor particle size had an effect on duodenal flow and apparent ruminal synthesis of vitamin B6. Apparent ruminal syntheses, expressed per unit of DMI, of all studied B vitamins but thiamin were negatively correlated with apparent ruminal digestibility of neutral detergent fiber. Duodenal flow of microbial N was positively correlated with apparent ruminal synthesis of riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, and folates. Under the conditions of the present experiment, except for thiamin, the effects of factors increasing starch digestibility of dry corn grain in the rumen on the amounts of B vitamins available for absorption by the dairy cow seem to be mediated through differences on ruminal digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and, to a lesser extent, on duodenal microbial N flow.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Within the last decade, it was realized that during and after long-duration spaceflight, some astronauts experience ophthalmic abnormalities including refractive changes, optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal folds, and cotton wool spots. Much research has been initiated and conducted, but little evidence is available to differentiate affected crewmembers. RECENT FINDINGS: The first published data to distinguish between affected and nonaffected crewmembers identified biochemical differences in affected astronauts: one-carbon pathway metabolite concentrations were higher in these individuals than in nonaffected astronauts, even before flight. These data led to findings that genetics and B-vitamin status were predictors of the incidence of the ophthalmic abnormalities. A multihit hypothesis was developed, with genetics and B-vitamin status as two of several important elements that all contribute to endothelial dysfunction and ultimately to ophthalmic changes after flight. One of these contributing factors - response to carbon dioxide exposure - was recently documented to be affected by the same one-carbon pathway genetics. SUMMARY: This line of research may help identify which astronauts are at risk of these ophthalmic changes, and allow targeted treatment. This research may have implications for clinical populations, including patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, that have similar biochemical, endocrine, and genetic characteristics, and it may shed light on why links between cardiovascular disease and the metabolites homocysteine and folate have been elusive and confounded.",

      "abstract": "The objectives were to determine the effects of a rumen-protected blend of B vitamins and choline (RPBC) on the incidence of health disorders, milk yield, and reproduction in early lactation and the effects on gene expression and liver fat infiltration. A randomized controlled trial in 3 commercial dairy herds (n = 1,346 cows with group as the experimental unit; experiment 1) and a university research herd (n = 50 cows with cow as the experimental unit; experiment 2) evaluated the use of 100 g/cow per d of commercially available proprietary RPBC supplement (Transition VB, Jefo, St. Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada), or a placebo, fed 3 wk before to 3 wk after calving. In experiment 2 liver biopsies were taken at 4 and 14 ± 1 d in milk to measure triacylglycerol concentrations and expression of 28 genes selected to represent relevant aspects of liver metabolism. Treatment effects were assessed using multivariable mixed logistic regression models for binary health and reproductive outcomes; linear regression models for milk yield, dry matter intake, and liver outcomes; and survival analysis for time insemination and pregnancy. In experiment 1, treatment did not have an effect on the incidence of hyperketonemia (blood β-hydroxybutyrate ≥ 1.2 mmol/L; cumulative incidence to 3 wk postpartum of 28 to 30%), clinical health disorders, or udder edema. The prevalence of anovulation at 8 wk postpartum was 11% in the treatment group and 23% in the control but did not differ statistically given group-level randomization. Pregnancy at first insemination (33 and 35%) and median time to pregnancy to 200 d in milk (96 and 97 d) were not different between treatment and control, respectively. No difference was observed between treatment groups in milk yield or components through the first 3 Dairy Herd Improvement Association test days (44 kg/d in both groups, accounting for parity and components). In experiment 2, there were no differences between treatment groups in feed intake. Mean blood β-hydroxybutyrate was lower at wk 3 in RPBC (0.6 vs. 0.9 ± 0.12 mmol/L) with no difference between treatments for mean blood concentrations of fatty acids (wk -1 or 1) and β-hydroxybutyrate at wk 1 or 2. The gene for acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) had lower mRNA abundance in RPBC with no difference between treatments for the other genes, but the expression of half of the genes assessed differed with days in milk. Liver triacylglycerol was lower in primiparous cows at 4 d in milk in RPBC (2.0 vs. 4.4 ± 1.2%) but not at 14 d in milk (2.2 vs. 3.2 ± 0.97%) with no treatment effect in multiparous cows (4.6 ± 0.8%). Accounting for parity, days in milk, fat and protein percentages, repeated test days, and a random effect of cow, no significant difference was observed between treatments in milk yield across the first 3 Dairy Herd Improvement Association tests (41.2 ± 1.3 in RPBC vs. 38.0 ± 1.4 kg/d in control). Under the diet and management conditions of the field study including low prevalence of clinical health disorders, in experiment 1 we did not detect a benefit of RPBC, but in experiment 2 liver fat content decreased in primiparous cows.",

      "abstract": "B vitamins are enzyme cofactors that play an important role in energy metabolism. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether B vitamin administration can reduce body weight (BW) gain by improving energy metabolism-related enzyme activities in rats fed on a highfat diet. Fifty rats were randomly assigned to one of the following five groups: control group (C), including rats fed on standard rat chow; four treatment groups (HO, HI, H2, and H3), in which rats were fed on a high-fat diet. Rats in the HI group were treated daily with 100 mg/kg BW thiamine (VB1), 100 mg/kg BW riboflavin (VB2), and 250 mg/kg BW niacin (VPP); rats in the H2 group were treated daily with 100 mg/kg BW pyridoxine (VB6), 100 mg/kg BW cobalamin (VB12), and 5 mg/kg BW folate (FA); and rats in the H3 group were treated daily with all of the B vitamins administered to the HI and H2 groups. After 12 weeks, the BW gains from the initial value were 154.5±58.4 g and 159.1±53.0 g in the HI and C groups, respectively, which were significantly less than the changes in the HO group (285.2±14.8 g, P<0.05). In the HO group, the plasma total cholesterol (CHO) and triglyceride (TG) levels were 1.59±0.30 mmol/L and 1,55±0.40 mmol/L, respectively, which were significantly greater than those in the HI group (1.19±0.18 mmol/L and 0.76±0.34 mmol/L, respectively, P<0.05). The activities of transketolase (TK), glutathione reductase, and Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase were significantly increased in the B vitamin-treated groups and were significantly greater than those in the HO group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvic acid kinase, and succinate dehydrogenase activities also were increased after treatment with B vitamins. Supplementation with B vitamins could effectively reduce BW gain and plasma levels of lipids by improving energy metabolism-related enzyme activities in rats, thus possibly providing potential benefits to humans.",

      "abstract": "Supplementation with B vitamins (vitamin B9(folic acid), vitamin B12 and vitamin B6) lowers blood total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations by about 25% and reduces the relative risk of stroke overall by about 10% (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99) compared with placebo. Homocysteine-lowering interventions have no significant effect on myocardial infarction, death from any cause or adverse outcomes. Factors that appear to modify the effect of B vitamins on stroke risk include low folic acid status, high tHcy, high cyanocobalamin dose in patients with impaired renal function and concurrent antiplatelet therapy. In regions with increasing levels or established policies of population folate supplementation, evidence from observational genetic epidemiological studies and randomised controlled clinical trials is concordant in suggesting an absence of benefit from lowering of homocysteine with folic acid for prevention of stroke. Clinical trials indicate that in countries which mandate folic acid fortification of food, folic acid supplementation has no significant effect on reducing stroke risk (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23). However, in countries without mandatory folic acid food fortification, folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of stroke by about 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.94). Folic acid alone or in combination with minimal cyanocobalamin (≤0.05 mg/day) is associated with an even greater reduction in risk of future stroke by 25% (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.86), whereas the combination of folic acid and a higher dose of cyanocobalamin (≥0.4 mg/day) is not associated with a reduced risk of future stroke (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05). The lack of benefit of folic acid plus higher doses of cyanocobalamin (≥0.4 mg/day) was observed in trials which all included participants with chronic kidney disease. Because metabolic B12 deficiency is very common and usually not diagnosed, future randomised trials of homocysteine-lowering interventions for stroke prevention should probably test a combination of folic acid and methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin instead of cyanocobalamin, and perhaps vitamin B6.",

Age-related declines in muscle mass and function are associated with huge and increasing costs to healthcare providers. Falls and loss of mobility and independence due to declining muscle mass/function are associated with poor clinical outcomes and their prevention and management are attractive research targets. Nutritional status appears a key modifiable and affordable intervention. There is emerging evidence of sarcopenia being the result not only of diminished anabolic activity but also of declining neurological integrity in older age, which is emerging as an important aspect of the development of age-related decline in muscle mass/function. In this connection, several B vitamins can be viewed as not only cofactors in muscle synthetic processes, but also as neurotrophic agents with involvements in both bioenergetic and trophic pathways. The B vitamins thus selected are examined with respect to their relevance to multiple aspects of neuromuscular function and evidence is considered that requirements, intakes or absorption may be altered in the elderly. In addition, the evidence base for recommended intakes (UK recommended daily allowance) is examined with particular reference to original datasets and their relevance to older individuals. It is possible that inconsistencies in the literature with respect to the nutritional management of sarcopenia may, in part at least, be the result of compromised micronutrient status in some study participants. It is suggested that in order, for example, for intervention with amino acids to be successful, underlying micronutrient deficiencies must first be addressed/eliminated.",

The sedative is mainly dexmedetomidine, combined with compound vitamin B, while control group did not feed the drug. The urine of two groups of individuals was collected before and after transportation and the cortisol content in urine was determined by radioimmunoassay as an indication of stress. Finally, referring to the changes of cortisol level in amur tiger, we analyzed the effect of vitamin B6 combined with sedative drugs on the anti stress effect of amur tiger. The results showed that the cortisol level in the control group was significantly different (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the cortisol level in the experimental group (P > 0.05).

Here we determined the associations of plasma homocysteine with B vitamins in patients with HD adequacy or inadequacy. METHODS: We recruited 68 patients who had received HD treatments (three times a week, 4 h each). Based on the individual's hemogram and quarterly urea reduction rate (Kt/V), patients were pooled into one of the following two groups: the first group with dialysis adequacy (Kt/V > 1.2, n = 48) and the second with dialysis inadequacy (Kt/V ≤ 1.2, n = 20). We also recorded the anthropometric date of each patient and their biochemical data and dietary intakes. Plasma levels of homocysteine, cysteine, folate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), and vitamin B12 were measured twice, once before and once after HD. RESULTS: The plasma levels of homocysteine, cysteine, folate, PLP, and vitamin B12 dropped significantly at the end of HD. The plasma levels of vitamin B12 were negatively correlated with the plasma levels of homocysteine, both pre- and post-HD, and in both groups regardless of dialysis adequacy or inadequacy. In contrast, plasma levels of folate and PLP were not correlated with homocysteine at both pre- or post-HD in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The plasma level of vitamin B12, but not folate or vitamin B6, was negatively correlated with that of homocysteine both before and after HD treatment, and regardless of dialysis adequacy or inadequacy.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants (mean ± SD of age = 68.4 ± 10.1 years) were randomized to receive 1200 IE vitamin D3 plus 800 mg Ca-carbonate alone (n = 31) or with 0.5 mg B9, 50 mg B6, and 0.5 mg B12 (n = 32). The CpG methylation of 3 genes (ASPA, ITGA2B, and PDE4C) and the changes in methylation were compared between the groups after 1 year. The changes of ASPA methylation from baseline were higher in the D + Ca + B than in the D + Ca group (1.40 ± 4.02 vs. -0.96 ± 5.12, respectively; p = 0.046, adjusted for age, sex, and baseline methylation). The changes in PDE4C from baseline were slightly higher in the D + Ca + B group (1.95 ± 3.57 vs. 0.22 ± 3.57; adjusted p = 0.062). Methylation of ITGA2B and its changes from baseline were not different between the intervention groups. Sex-adjusted odds ratio of accelerated aging (chronological age < biological age at 1 year) was 5.26 (95% confidence interval 1.51-18.28) in the D + Ca + B compared with the D + Ca group. Accelerated aging in both groups was associated with younger age. In the D + Ca + B group, it was additionally associated with lower baseline homocysteine. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D + Ca + B and D + Ca differentially affected epigenetic age markers, although the effect size appeared to be small after 1 year. B-vitamins effect in young subjects with low homocysteine requires further investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02586181.",

After an initial wash-in period, all dogs were tested over a 6-month period on cognitive test protocols that assessed four phases of a landmark discrimination learning protocol, which assessed a spatial learning skill based on utilisation of external cues, and egocentric discrimination task, which assessed spatial learning based on internal body-centred cues. The BPB-supplemented group showed significantly better performance than the controls on the landmark 1 (P=0·0446) discrimination learning tasks, and on two egocentric discrimination reversal learning tasks (P=0·005 and P=0·01, respectively). The groups did not differ significantly (P>0·10) on the landmark zero discrimination task and the egocentric discrimination learning task. These results suggest beneficial effects are positively linked to task complexity. Many of the nutrients supplemented in the BPB diet were significantly higher in plasma, including arginine, α-tocopherol, DHA and EPA. These results indicate that long-term supplementation with the BPB can have cognition-improving effects and support the use of nutritional strategies in targeting brain ageing-associated risk factors as an intervention to delay cognitive ageing.",

      "abstract": "B vitamin therapy lowers plasma total homocysteine concentrations, and might be a beneficial intervention for stroke prevention; however, cyanocobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) can accelerate decline in renal function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with impaired renal function. Although early trials did not show benefit in reduction of stroke, these results might have been due to harm in participants with impaired renal function. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, cyanocobalamin is harmful, whereas B vitamins appear to reduce cardiovascular events in study participants with normal renal function. Our meta-analysis of individual patient data from two large trials of B vitamin therapy (VISP and VITATOPS) indicates that patients with impaired renal function who are exposed to high-dose cyanocobalamin do not benefit from therapy with B vitamins for the prevention of stroke (risk ratio 1·04, 95% CI 0·84-1·27), however, patients with normal renal function who are not exposed to high-dose cyanocobalamin benefit significantly from this treatment (0.78, 0·67-0·90; interaction p=0·03). The potential benefits of B vitamin therapy with folic acid and methylcobalamin or hydroxycobalamin, instead of cyanocobalamin, to lower homocysteine concentrations in people at high risk of stroke warrant further investigation.",

The experiment was a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d treatment periods. The 4 treatments were a control diet without fatty acid supplement and 3 diets with 2.5% additional fatty acids from supplements containing (1) SFA, (2) an intermediate mixture of SFA and UFA, or (3) UFA. All diets were served as a total mixed ration once daily at 115% of the expected intake. B-vitamin concentrations were analyzed in feed and duodenal digesta. Apparent ruminal synthesis of each B vitamin was calculated as the DF minus the intake. B-vitamin concentrations were similar among the 4 treatments; consequently, daily intake of the vitamins followed the same pattern as dry matter intake. Adding FS decreased B-vitamin intakes (except vitamin B12), as did increasing the proportion of UFA. Riboflavin and niacin DF and ARS, expressed as total daily amount or per unit of dry matter intake, were not affected by FS, but increasing the proportion of UFA decreased riboflavin and niacin DF and ARS. Fat supplements decreased DF of vitamin B6, expressed either as total daily amount or per unit of dry matter intake. No treatment effects were observed on total daily folate DF and ARS. However, when expressed per unit of dry matter intake, folate DF and ARS were greater when cows were fed FS and they increased linearly with the proportion of UFA in the supplement. Inclusion of fat supplements into the dairy cow diet had a limited effect on the fate of most B vitamins in the rumen although increasing the proportion of UFA in the FS linearly decreased apparent synthesis of riboflavin and niacin in the rumen and the amounts of these vitamins reaching the small intestine.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical value of anti-epileptic drugs combined with B vitamins in the treatment of epilepsy after stroke. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 90 consecutive patients with epilepsy after stroke. Patients were randomly divided into groups of 30 each according to treatment: single-agent or combination anti-epileptic therapy with oxcarbazepine and sodium valproate (control group), anti-epileptic therapy with compound vitamin B tablets (observation group 1), and anti-epileptic therapy with vitamin B12 (mecobalamin) (observation group 2). After 12 months, treatment effects were assessed and compared among groups. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, observation group 2 had better epilepsy control and observation group 1 had no difference in efficacy. New-onset stroke was seen in three cases (10%) of the control group and in two cases (6.7%) of observation group 1. This was not seen in observation group 2. In the control group and observation group 1, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score significantly decreased after 6 months, but increased again at 12 months. Conversely, NIHSS score continuously decreased during follow-up in observation group 2. The plasma level of asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) gradually increased in the control group and observation group 1, but remained unchanged in observational group 2. The differences in NIHSS scores and plasma ADMA levels between the control and observation groups were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-epilepsy drugs combined with B vitamins can improve epilepsy control after stroke and reduce new stroke occurrence. This effect may be associated with stability of plasma ADMA levels. Vitamin B12 may be better than vitamin B complex in the treatment of epilepsy after stroke.",

      "abstract": "Elevated plasma homocysteine levels are associated with increased risk of fractures in observational studies. However, it is unsettled whether homocysteine-lowering treatment affects fracture risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an intervention with B vitamins on the risk of hip fracture in a secondary analysis of combined data from two large randomized controlled trials originally designed to study cardiovascular diseases. Both trials had identical design, intervention, and primary objective. Based on a two-by-two factorial design, the intervention consisted of a daily capsule with either (1) folic acid (0.8 mg) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg) and vitamin B6 (40 mg); (2) folic acid (0.8 mg) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg); (3) vitamin B6 alone (40 mg); or (4) placebo. The participants were followed with respect to hip fracture during the trial or during an extended follow-up (from the trial start for each patient until the end of 2012). No statistically significant association was found between folic acid plus vitamin B12 treatment and the risk of hip fracture, neither during the trial (median 3.3 years; hazard ratio [HR] 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 1.59) nor during the extended follow-up (median 11.1 years; HR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.40). Nor were there significant differences in the risk of hip fracture between groups receiving versus not receiving vitamin B6 during the trial (HR 1.42; 95% CI, 0.78 to 2.61). However, during the extended follow-up, those receiving vitamin B6 showed a significant 42% higher risk of hip fracture (HR 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.83) compared to those not receiving vitamin B6 . In conclusion, treatment with folic acid plus vitamin B12 was not associated with the risk of hip fracture. Treatment with a high dose of vitamin B6 was associated with a slightly increased risk of hip fracture during the extended follow-up (in-trial plus post-trial follow-up). © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

Aim of this study was to review the evidence of the literature about the therapeutic effects of a plant product containing flower pollen extracts and group B vitamins on symptoms resolution and amelioration of CP/CPPS patients' quality of life and to investigate the knowledge among practicing urologists about the clinical application of this product. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 38 urologists was submitted to an investigational survey of the knowledge of the clinical applications of a plant product containing flower pollen extracts and group B vitamins Results: 71% of the urologists interviewed prescribed the plant product for CBP and CP/CPPS at least one time in a month and 11% prescribed it more than 5 times; 67% had evidence of clear ameliorations in pain relief and on patient's quality of life and 47% reported that the effectiveness is comparable to NSAIDs; 39% also reported a significant effect for the improvement of the urinary symptoms of patients. No gastric or general side effects have been noticed during the administration period of this plant product. Finally, the cost of the product has always reported to be sustainable for the patients. CONCLUSIONS: From the results of this investigational survey, we can state that the plant product containing flower pollen extracts and group B vitamins is well-known and demonstrated beneficial effects on symptoms resolution and amelioration of quality of life in patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Opiate analgesics are the most effective treatments for severe pain, but their clinical utility is often hampered by the development of analgesic tolerance. There are striking similarities between morphine actions and neuropathic pain. We have demonstrated that B vitamins can attenuate neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury, sensory neuron inflammation/compression, and transient spinal cord ischemia. Given this similarity, the present study investigated whether B vitamins might be able to modify the antinociceptive effect of morphine as well as morphine tolerance in mice. METHODS: Cell signaling was assayed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Antinociception was assessed in ICR mice using the tail flick. The effects of B vitamins on acute morphine-induced antinociception and chronic morphine tolerance were studied. RESULTS: 1) Co-administration of B vitamins with morphine potentiates acute morphine antinociception. 2) B vitamins attenuate the development of antinociceptive tolerance to chronic morphine administration and inhibit morphine-induced p-NR1, p-PKC in the spinal cord. 3) Morphine induces microglial activation, as evidenced by increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation, IBA1, and IL-1β in the spinal cord, and these changes are inhibited by B vitamins. 4) Treatment of B vitamins alone shows no notable effects on pain threshold and activity of microglia invivo. CONCLUSIONS: B vitamins potentiate acute morphine antinociception and attenuate chronic morphine tolerance.",

We conducted a crossover trial to determine whether B-vitamin supplementation averts such changes. Ten healthy adults blindly received a 2-h, controlled-exposure experiment to sham under placebo, PM2.5 (250 μg/m3) under placebo, and PM2.5 (250 μg/m3) under B-vitamin supplementation (2.5 mg/d folic acid, 50 mg/d vitamin B6, and 1 mg/d vitamin B12), respectively. We profiled epigenome-wide methylation before and after each experiment using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in peripheral CD4+ T-helper cells. PM2.5 induced methylation changes in genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism. B-vitamin supplementation prevented these changes. Likewise, PM2.5 depleted 11.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4%, 21.7%; P = 0.04] of mitochondrial DNA content compared with sham, and B-vitamin supplementation attenuated the PM2.5 effect by 102% (Pinteraction = 0.01). Our study indicates that individual-level prevention may be used to complement regulations and control potential mechanistic pathways underlying the adverse PM2.5 effects, with possible significant public health benefit in areas with frequent PM2.5 peaks.",

A systematic review of the available literature was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of specific dietary supplements in managing female stress and anxiety. OBJECTIVES: To identify the impact of essential fatty acids (EFAs), B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and/or zinc, consumed as dietary supplements to the daily diet, on female stress and anxiety levels. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 18 years and over, who had participated in a study where stress and/or anxiety were assessed. TYPES OF INTERVENTION(S): Dietary supplementation with EFAs, B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and/or zinc. TYPES OF COMPARATORS: Supplements, either alone or combined, were compared with either no intervention or placebo. TYPES OF STUDIES: Randomized controlled and pseudo-randomized trials were included. OUTCOMES: Stress and anxiety were assessed using self-report or physiological outcome measures. SEARCH STRATEGY: Published and unpublished studies were sought via MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MedNar, National Institute of Mental Health and the International Association for Women's Mental Health. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Methodological quality was evaluated using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted using the standardized data extraction instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to heterogeneity of the included studies, narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Essential fatty acids were effective in reducing perceived stress and salivary cortisol levels during pregnancy and anxiety in premenstrual women, and anxiety during menopause in the absence of depression, but were ineffective when depression was disregarded. Disregarding the hormonal phase, EFAs were ineffective in reducing stress or anxiety in four groups of women. Combined magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation reduced premenstrual anxiety but had no effect when used in isolation and did not affect stress in women suffering from dysmenorrhea when combined or used in isolation. Older women experienced anxiety reduction using vitamin B6, but not folate or vitamin B12. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C was effective in reducing anxiety and blood pressure in response to stress. CONCLUSION: The current review suggests that EFAs may be effective in reducing prenatal stress and salivary cortisol and may reduce anxiety during premenstrual syndrome and during menopause in the absence of depression. Magnesium and vitamin B6 may be effective in combination in reducing premenstrual stress, and vitamin B6 alone may reduce anxiety effectively in older women. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C may reduce anxiety and mitigate increased blood pressure in response to stress. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Essential fatty acids may be effective in reducing prenatal stress and salivary cortisol levels, and premenstrual or menopausal anxiety in the absence of depression. Combining magnesium and vitamin B6 may reduce premenstrual anxiety and vitamin B6 may reduce anxiety in older women. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C may reduce anxiety and mitigate increased blood pressure in response to stress. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Investigating supplementation in longer term studies is warranted and should include compliance testing, the use of inert substances as controls and reliable outcome measures.",

      "abstract": "Effects of the forage-to-concentrate ratio on apparent ruminal synthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folates, and vitamin B12 were evaluated in an experiment using 14 ruminally and duodenally cannulated Holstein cows. The experiment was a crossover design with two 15-d treatment periods and a 14-d preliminary period in which cows were fed a diet intermediate in composition between the treatment diets. Treatments were diets containing low-forage (44.8% forage, 32.8% starch, 24.4% neutral detergent fiber) or high-forage (61.4% forage, 22.5% starch, 30.7% neutral detergent fiber) concentrations. Both diets were formulated with different proportions of the same ingredients. Concentrations of B vitamins were analyzed in feed and duodenal digesta. Apparent ruminal synthesis of each B vitamin was calculated as the duodenal flow minus the intake. The high-forage diet had the highest concentrations of riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, and folates, whereas the low-forage diet had the highest thiamine concentration. Vitamin B12 in the diets was under the level of detection. Consequently, despite a reduction in dry matter intake when the cows were fed the high-forage diet, increasing dietary forage concentration increased or tended to increase intakes of riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin B6 but reduced thiamine and folate intakes. Increasing dietary forage concentration reduced apparent ruminal degradation of thiamine and apparent ruminal synthesis of riboflavin, niacin, and folates and increased ruminal degradation of vitamin B6, but had no effect on ruminal synthesis of vitamin B12. As a consequence, increasing the forage-to-concentrate ratio had no effect on the amounts of thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin B12 reaching the small intestine but decreased the amounts of niacin, vitamin B6, and folates available for absorption. Apparent ruminal syntheses of riboflavin, niacin, folates, and vitamin B12 were correlated positively with the amount of starch digested in the rumen and duodenal flow of microbial N, whereas these correlations were negative for thiamine. Apparent ruminal syntheses of thiamine and vitamin B6 were negatively correlated with their respective intakes, whereas folate intake was positively correlated with its synthesis in the rumen.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Observationally, homocysteine is positively associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and unhealthy lipids; folate and vitamin B12, which reduce homocysteine, are associated with lower IHD risk and healthy lipids. Randomized controlled trials have shown no benefits of folate and vitamin B12 for IHD. To clarify the role of these potential targets of intervention in IHD we assessed how genetically determined homocysteine, folate and vitamin-B12-affected IHD and lipids. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Separate-sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments, that is, Mendelian randomization, was used to obtain unconfounded estimates (based on strongly related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) using CARDIoGRAMplusC4D, a large coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction (CAD/MI) case (n=64 374)-control (n=130 681) study with extensive genotyping, and the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium Results (n=196 475). RESULTS: Homocysteine was unrelated to CAD/MI (odds ratio (OR) 1.07 per log-transformed s.d., 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.19) based on 14 SNPs, as was folate (OR 1.18 per s.d., 95% CI 0.80 to 1.75) based on rs153734, and vitamin B12 (OR 0.98 per log-transformed s.d., 95% CI 0.85 to 1.14) based on rs602662, rs9473555, rs526934 and rs11254363. Homocysteine and folate were not clearly associated with lipids, vitamin B12 was associated with higher inverse normal transformed low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12) and triglycerides (0.05, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not corroborate the observed positive association of homocysteine or negative associations of folate and vitamin B12 with CAD/MI. Vitamin B12 might be associated with an unfavorable lipid profile.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this trial was to investigate the influence of a dietetic product consisting of a unique combination of L-arginine with the vitamins B6, folic acid and B12 (Telcor® Arginin plus) on endothelial dysfunction. METHODS: Subjects aged 40-65 years with mild to moderate blood pressure (BP) elevation not treated with anti-hypertensive drugs were randomly assigned to either the dietetic product (n = 40) or a matching placebo (n = 41) for 3 months with open follow-up for a further 3 months. Postprandial change in endothelial function was assessed using the validated reactive hyperaemia index (RHI) at 3 months compared to the study onset (RHI post-pre, visit 3-visit 1; ΔΔRHI). Secondary parameters included BP and plasma homocysteine concentration. RESULTS: The primary efficacy analysis revealed superiority of the nutritional intervention over placebo (p = 0.0349) in reducing the deterioration of endothelial function. While in the active group ΔΔRHI increased (0.371 ± 0.122), almost no change could be detected in the placebo group (0.031 ± 0.100), thus demonstrating a significant improvement in vascular function in the intervention group. Moreover, the intervention reduced BP and homocysteine levels. Non-serious adverse events were equally distributed in both groups, and none of the events were assessed as possibly intervention-related by the investigators. CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed the effective and safe use of dietary management with L-arginine in combination with B vitamins. The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated a statistically significant superiority of the combination of L-arginine with B vitamins over placebo in improving and restoring impaired endothelial function and lowering BP in patients with mild to moderate blood pressure elevation.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To assess results of the finger-to-floor distance (FFD) and the Schober test performed during the DOLOR study, and to verify correlation between Visual Analog Pain Scale scores (VAS) with these measures. Research design and methods: Previously tabulated data from the Clinical Research Forms of the DOLOR study were analyzed (statistical significance defined with a two-tailed p value < 0.05 and confidence interval of 95%). For continuous variables, the Student's T- test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, and differences between pre-treatment and Visits 2, 3, and 4 in the absolute number and percentage of patients with no change, improvement, or worsening of the Schober test and the FFD test scores were calculated, and the results were analyzed with the Chi-squared test. Spearman non-parametric correlation was used for correlating VAS scores with FFD and Schober test scores at each study visit. Main outcome measures: FFD, measured in centimeters; Schober test scores. Results: Throughout the treatment period, there was a statistically significant correlation between the VAS scores and the FFD in the total patient population and within treatment groups. This was not observed for the correlation between the Schober's test scores and the VAS scores. FFD scores within treatment groups improved progressively at each study visit, as did the Schober Test scores. Conclusions: The results of this post-hoc analysis show that combination therapy with diclofenac plus vitamins B1, B6, and B12 had additional positive effects on mobility restoration among the patients of the DOLOR study and serve to highlight the correlation between mobility and pain intensity among patients presenting with low back pain. The two fundamental goals of low back pain therapy are to provide improvements in pain and function. In this sense, the combination of diclofenac with the B vitamins was particularly effective in achieving both of these goals."

      "abstract": "B vitamins play an essential role in DNA synthesis and methylation, and may protect against oesophageal and gastric cancers. In this case-cohort study, subjects were enrolled from the General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial in Linxian, China. Subjects included 498 oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), 255 gastric cardia adenocarcinomas (GCAs), and an age- and sex-matched sub-cohort of 947 individuals. Baseline serum riboflavin, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), folate, vitamin B12, and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) were measured for all subjects. We estimated the associations with Cox proportional hazard models, with adjustment for potential confounders. Compared to those in the lowest quartile of serum riboflavin, those in the highest had a 44% lower risk of OSCC (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.75). Serum vitamin B12 as a continuous variable was observed to be significantly inversely associated with OSCC (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.01, P for score test = 0.041). Higher serum FMN levels were significantly associated with increased risk of OSCC (HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.16) and GCA (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.20). Our study prompted that B vitamins have the potential role as chemopreventive agents for upper gastrointestinal cancers.",
