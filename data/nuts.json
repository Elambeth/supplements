      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The fruit of the cashew tree, known as cashew, is accompanied by the fleshy extension of its stem, referred to as the cashew nut. Rich in phenolic compounds, such as phenolic acids, anthocyanins, flavonoids, carotenoids, polyphenols, as well as vitamins C and E, the cashew nut exhibits antioxidant properties. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review investigated the effects of cashew nuts on oxidative stress in rats. METHODOLOGY: The study followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO. Searches were conducted in the Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, BVS, MedRxiv, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Experimental studies with rats as the target population, evaluating the effects of cashew nut supplementation on oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymatic activities, and inflammatory markers, were included. Exclusion criteria comprised dissertations, reviews, expert opinions, duplicates, and preprints. RESULTS: Five studies published between 2018 and 2022 were included, all utilizing cashew nut supplementation as the intervention. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in oxidative stress, an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and catalase, and a decrease in inflammatory markers, including TNF-α and IL-1β. The most effective dose was 100 mg/kg/day, yielding consistent results across studies. CONCLUSION: Cashew nuts show potential for reducing oxidative stress, mitigating inflammation, and enhancing antioxidant defenses in rats. However, further clinical studies are required to better explore their benefits in humans, a field that remains less studied compared to other types of nuts."

      "abstract": "Consuming functional foods alongside the energy-restricted diet can be a great ally in weight loss and improving cardiometabolic risk factors. Whether Brazil nut (BN) consumption in the context of energy restriction affects them remains to be answered. We aimed to evaluate the effect of BN within an energy-restricted diet on cardiometabolic risk markers among women. This is an eight-week, quasi-experimental, controlled nutritional intervention study. The women were allocated into two energy-restricted (-500 kcal/d) groups: a control free of BN (n=29) and a BN-group (BNG) (n=27) with 2 units/day of BN (~ 347 µg of selenium). Both groups had similar weight loss, but in the BNG, the serum selenium increased by 276.7% and apolipoprotein A1 increased by 27.4%. In addition, BNG had a more pronounced reduction in liver enzymes, and presented the most preserved percentages of lean and fat-free mass in relation to the control group. Consuming 2 units/day of BN in an 8-week weight loss intervention improved cardiometabolic risk markers in women. Our results suggest that regular consumption of BN during energy-restricted diets may be a strategy to minimize adiposity, preserve lean mass, improve serum selenium status, lipid, and liver metabolism markers, and, consequently, help obesity management and its comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "SETTING: The Quw'utsun Preterm Birth Study used a community-led and participatory action research methodology to investigate preterm birth in Quw'utsun, a First Nations community in Cowichan Valley, British Columbia (BC). Quw'utsun people and staff from the community's Ts'ewulhtun Health Centre partnered with the BC First Nations Health Authority, Island Health (regional health authority), and the University of British Columbia to develop Nuts'a'maat shqwaluwun (one heart, one mind), a framework for conducting research activities. INTERVENTION: Guided by Elders, Nuts'a'maat shqwaluwun incorporated Quw'utsun standards for research ethics by knitting together snuw'uy'ulh (ways of life), such as Stsi'elh stuhw tu Sul-hween (honour the Elders), with federal policy for ethical conduct of research involving Indigenous people. Situating the study at Cowichan Tribes strengthened the community's authority to lead. OUTCOME: The framework, Nuts'a'maat shqwaluwun, fostered a research environment where we could Ti'tul'atul' tst (learn from one another). We learned to bring our knowledges together to conduct the study in ways that respected snuw'uy'ulh. This research was meaningful to Quw'utsun people because snuw'uy'ulh were respected. Our partnerships resulted in the first-ever report of preterm birth rates and risk factors among Quw'utsun people. Knowledge translation activities enhanced community access to results. IMPLICATIONS: Indigenous Peoples have an inherent and legislated right to self-determination, including the right to lead research involving them. Several principles within Nuts'a'maat shqwaluwun enabled Quw'utsun people to lead this research: (1) trusting relationships; (2) respecting community-specific ways of life; (3) community ownership and access to data; and (4) training opportunities to lead research."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Nut consumption is attributed to improvements in risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including high blood pressure (BP) and dyslipidemia. However, it is unclear whether these effects are altered with concurrent treatment with BP and lipid-lowering medication. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the effects of the consumption of whole tree nuts and peanuts (collectively termed nuts) on BP and lipids, and whether BP and lipid-lowering medication use alters these effects. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched through June 21, 2023, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of nut consumption on BP and/or lipids. DATA EXTRACTION: Random effects meta-analyses (mean difference, 95% confidence interval [CI]) were conducted, with subgroup analyses based on reported participant use of BP or lipid-lowering medication, including medicated, unmedicated, unreported (ie, use not specified), and mixed (ie, included combined data from medicated and unmedicated participants). A total of 115 studies were included in the review, of which 109 were meta-analysed. DATA ANALYSIS: Nut consumption significantly reduced triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, with no effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or blood pressure. Few studies were conducted in medicated participants only (n = 1 for lipid outcomes only), and for the studies including both medicated and unmedicated participants (ie, mixed), outcomes by medication use were not reported. Significant differences in TG and apolipoprotein B were observed between medication use groups, with nut consumption resulting in the largest reductions in unmedicated participants. Strong heterogeneity was observed with no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Lipid-lowering, but not BP-lowering benefits of nut consumption were observed; however, few studies reported the effect based on participants' medication status. Future studies are required to determine if there are additional benefits of including nuts in the diet of medicated patients with cardiovascular disease.

      "abstract": "Aspergillus spp. and their produced aflatoxins are responsible for contaminating 25-30% of the global food supply, including many grains, and nuts which when consumed are detrimental to human and animal health. Despite regulatory frameworks, Aspergillus spp. and aflatoxin contamination is still a global challenge, especially in cereal-based matrices and their derived by-products. The methods for reducing Aspergillus spp. and aflatoxin contamination involve various approaches, including physical, chemical, and biological control strategies. Recently, a novel technology, atmospheric cold plasma (ACP), has emerged which can reduce mold populations and also degrade these toxins. ACP is a non-thermal technology that operates at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It can reduce mold and toxins from grains and seeds without affecting food quality or leaving any chemical residue. ACP is the conversion of a gas, such as air, into a reactive gas. Specifically, an electrical charge is applied to the \"working\" gas (air) leading to the breakdown of diatomic oxygen, diatomic nitrogen, and water vapor into a mixture of radicals (e.g., atomic oxygen, atomic nitrogen, atomic hydrogen, hydroxyls), metastable species, and ions (e.g., nitrate, nitrite, peroxynitrate). In a cold plasma process, approximately 5% or less of the working gas is ionized. However, cold plasma treatment can generate over 1000 ppm of reactive gas species (RGS). The final result is a range of bactericidal and fungicidal molecules such as ozone, peroxides, nitrates, and many others. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms and chemistry of ACP and its application in inactivating Aspergillus spp. and degrading aflatoxins, serving as a novel treatment to enhance the safety and quality of grains and nuts. The final section of the review discusses the commercialization status of ACP treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been increasing in young adults, concomitant with the occurrence of increased abdominal adiposity. We previously reported that consuming tree nuts, as replacement for typical high-carbohydrate snacks, reduces visceral fat and waist circumference in young adults who have one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors. We aimed to investigate the effects of tree nuts snack consumption on plasma and adipose tissue fatty acid profiles along with changes in the expression of adipose tissue genes involved in thermogenesis, glycemia, adipocyte signaling, lipolysis, and immunity. METHODS: A randomized parallel-arm 16-week intervention trial was conducted in 84 adults aged 22-36 years. Participants in both groups were provided with caloric goals for weight maintenance, daily menus, and pre-portioned snacks at every other week visits with study registered dietitians. Changes in dietary fatty acid intakes, plasma and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) triglycerides fatty acid profiles using gas-liquid chromatography, and the expression of 241 genes in abdominal SAT were evaluated. RESULTS: Consuming tree nuts snacks increased mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid intakes yielding a 9-fold greater dietary unsaturated to saturated fat ratio. The tree nuts snack group also had significantly greater improvements in plasma 16:1/16:0 ratio; plasma phospholipids oleic and gamma linolenic acid content; plasma diglycerides, triglycerides, and cholesterol esters oleic acid content; and total plasma monounsaturated fatty acids. While abdominal SAT only showed trends for increased oleic acid content and unsaturated to saturated fat ratio, the tree nuts snacks participants had altered expression of 13 genes in abdominal SAT that have roles in nutrient sensing, energy homeostasis, and vulnerability to obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Replacing typical high-carbohydrate snacks with tree nuts results in more favorable dietary, plasma, and adipose tissue fatty acid profiles that could aid in preventing the development of excess adiposity and cardiometabolic disease states including metabolic syndrome. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT03969264.",

Studies suggest that nuts, rich in nutritional compounds, can improve cognitive function. This study aimed to investigate the effects of consuming nuts on improving cognitive and executive function in obese children. METHODS: In this randomized parallel clinical trial, ninety 8 to 10-year-old girls with obesity were divided into intervention (30 g of nuts/daily) and control groups (no nuts) for 8 weeks. Furthermore, the Wechsler Four (WISC-IV) questionnaire assessed children's cognitive function, and executive function was assessed by the behavior rating inventory of executive function (BRIEF) parental questionnaire. Linear mixed-effect models were done to survey the effects of nut intake on cognitive and executive function. RESULTS: Forty people with a mean age of 9 ± 0.7 years from each group cooperated to the end of the study. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in the total Wechsler score (differences: 23.1, 95% CI: 17.5, 28.7; PTime×Group < 0.001) and total BRIEF score (differences: - 16.5, 95% CI: - 29.4, - 3.5; PTime×Group < 0.05) compared to the control group. Moreover, other components of the Wechsler and BRIEF tests including picture completion, picture concept, block design, object assembly, short-term memory, digit span, inhibition, displacement, initiation, and organization were significantly improved in the nuts group compared to the control group after the 8th weeks. CONCLUSION: These results underline the potential of nut consumption as a dietary intervention to improve cognitive function over an eight-week period, highlighting its role in supporting brain health and cognitive development of obese children.",

      "abstract": "Hickory (Carya cathayensis Sarg.) is a unique economic tree species in China, and its nuts are rich in nutrition. However, its seed coat harbors abundant astringent compounds including phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, and others, necessitating their removal prior to consumption. Traditional high-temperature boiling, while effective in reducing astringency, incurs nutrient loss, environmental pollution, and elevates processing costs. Consequently, there is a pressing need to improve de-astringency techniques for hickory nuts. Using widely-targeted metabolomics, electronic nose analysis and other techniques, the effects of microbial tannase on the astringency, nutrient composition and flavor of hickory nuts were explored. Herein, it was found that the astringency, total phenol and condensed tannins of hickory nut were significantly reduced after the treatment with microbial tannase. Widely-targeted metabolomics analysis further unveiled that most of the phenols, flavones and tannins containing gallic ester linkages in hickory were degraded upon microbial tannase treatment, suggesting that the primary mechanism by which microbial tannase exerts its de-astringent effects may lie in the targeted hydrolysis of galloyl-containing compounds. Notably, the tannase-treated hickory kernels demonstrated a notable retention of nutrients such as soluble proteins and total oils compared to boiled hickory kernels, highlighting its gentle processing nature. In terms of aroma, the tannase-treated hickory kernels were more similar to the non-treated, owing to the preservation of a higher content of pyrazines, pyrans, furans, esters, and alcohols associated with fruity, floral, butterscotch, and sweetness of hickory nuts. These results suggest that microbial tannase can effectively reduce the astringency and preserve the volatilecompounds of hickory nut, providing a theoretical basis for developing a novel and green de-astringent technology for the hickory nut processing industry.",

They were roasted at 180 °C for 20 min in an oven. The aim was to establish the changes that occurred in the chemical (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, ash, fibers), lipid composition (fatty acids, tocopherols, sterols, phospholipids), and physicochemical characteristics (peroxide value, acid value, iodine value, conjugated dienes and trienes) after roasting of the pine nuts. The results showed that the composition of the raw and roasted nuts differed (p < 0.05). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in the oxidative stability of raw and roasted nuts from Baikal and, the content of unsaponifiable substances and sterols in the nut oil from Vladivostok. The roasting process influences the isolated oils from pine nuts as the chemical and lipid composition changes of oils from Baikal are significant (p < 0.05). Both raw and roasted pine nuts have high energy value, protein content, and good health benefits and can be consumed either way. Overall, it was established that the roasting of pine nuts had little impact on their lipid composition; the nuts could also be a source of lipid-soluble bioactive components and might have health-promoting effects."

This research aimed to map the changes in the gut microbiome and blood markers of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats after a dietary intervention with free or immobilized cells of the presumptive probiotic Pediococcus acidilactici SK on pistachio nuts. METHODS: Twenty-four male Wistar rats were studied and divided into four groups (healthy or diabetic) which received the free or the immobilized P. acidilactici SK cells on pistachio nuts for 4 weeks. Blood, fecal, and intestinal tissue samples were examined. RESULTS: The diabetic rats exhibited an elevated concentration of HDL-c, while the inflammatory IL-1β levels were significantly lower in the diabetic animals that received the immobilized cells compared to the group that received the free cells. The dietary intervention with immobilized cells led to decreased counts of fecal staphylococci and enterococci in the diabetic animals, while the diet with both free and immobilized P. acidilactici SK cells rendered levels of these populations in normal values in the feces and intestinal tissue of the diabetic animals. Noticeably, the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera were elevated after the supplementation with immobilized P. acidilactici SK cells on pistachio nuts. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplementation with P. acidilactici SK cells (in free or in immobilized form) beneficially affected the gut microbiota/microbiome of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, leading to the alleviation of dysbiosis and inflammation and control over their lipid levels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nuts consumption is related to cardioprotective effects on primary cardiovascular prevention, but studies conducted in secondary prevention are small, scarce and controversial. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effects of a regional and sustainable cardioprotective diet added or not with an affordable mixed nuts on cardiometabolic features in patients with previous myocardial infarction. METHODS: DICA-NUTS study is a national, multi-center, and superiority-parallel randomized clinical trial. Males and females over 40 years old diagnosed with previous myocardial infarction in the last 2 to 6 months were included. Patients were allocated into two groups: the Brazilian Cardioprotective diet (DICA Br) supplemented with 30 g/day of mixed nuts (10 g of peanuts; 10 g of cashew; 10 g of Brazil nuts) (intervention group, n = 193); or only DICA Br prescription (control group, n = 195). The primary outcome was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol means (in mg/dL) after 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were other lipid biomarkers, glycemic and anthropometric data and diet quality. RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline values, participating study site, time since myocardial infarction and statin treatment regimen (high potency, moderate and low potency/no statins), no significant difference was found between the groups in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (intervention-control difference: 3.48 mg/dL [-3.45 to 10.41], P = 0.32). Both groups improved their overall diet quality at the end of the study without differences between them after 16 weeks (intervention-control difference: 1.05 (-0.9 to 2.99); P = 0.29). Other lipids, glycemic profile and anthropometrics were also not different between study groups at the end of the study. CONCLUSION: Adding 30 g/day of mixed nuts to the DICA Br for 16 weeks did not change lipid, glycemic and anthropometric features in the post-myocardial infarction setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov website under number NCT03728127 and its World Health Organization Universal Trial Number (WHO-UTN) is U1111-1259-8105.",

We systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate if nut consumption favors people on energy restriction (ER) dietary interventions. Four databases were used to search for eligible articles in May 2024. This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guide, and the bias risk of papers was evaluated. For the meta-analysis, we extracted the endpoint values of the group's variables and estimated the effect sizes by the random-effects model. Sixteen and ten articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Almonds were evaluated in the majority of studies (n = 6). The consumption of nuts (28 to 84 g/d, 4 to 72 months) included in ER (-250 to 1000 kcal/d) did not differently affect anthropometry (weight loss, BMI, waist and hip circumferences), body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass, or lean mass), markers of glucose (glycemia and insulinemia), lipid metabolism (total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, LDL-c/HDL-c, or triglycerides), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In most analyses, stratifying studies by type of nut or intervention time did not present different results in the meta-analysis. As there are few studies, in addition to great methodological variability, more high-quality trials are needed to confirm these results. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42023444878."

This randomized trial aimed to assess the effects of cashew nuts and their oil on intestinal permeability and inflammatory markers. Sixty-four adults with overweight or obesity were allocated into three groups receiving energy restriction (-500 kcal/day): control (CT, free nuts), cashew nuts (CN, 30 g/day), or cashew nut oil (OL, 30 mL/day). Urine lactulose and mannitol, plasma zonulin and the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), plasma interleukins (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-12p70), and C-reactive proteins were analyzed. Energy restriction reduced body fat and other indicators of adiposity without differences between the groups. Only the control group increased LBPs after an 8-week intervention. There were no statistically significant differences found between the groups in terms of intestinal permeability and inflammatory markers. In conclusion, incorporating cashew nuts or cashew nut oil into an energy-restricted 8-week dietary intervention did not change intestinal permeability and inflammatory markers. As studies evaluating cashew nuts on these markers remain scarce, further research is needed, perhaps with a longer study period and a higher concentration of cashew nuts and oil."

Pediatric ACTs typically occur in the context of a germline TP53 mutation, can be cured when diagnosed at an early stage, but are difficult to treat when advanced or associated with concurrent TP53 and ATRX alterations. Recent work has demonstrated DNA methylation patterns suggestive of prognostic significance. While current treatment standards rely heavily upon surgical resection, chemotherapy, and hormonal modulation, small cohort studies suggest promise for multi-tyrosine kinases targeting anti-angiogenic pathways or immunomodulatory therapies. Future work will focus on novel risk stratification algorithms and combination therapies intended to mitigate toxicity for patients with perceived low-risk disease while intensifying therapy or accelerating discoveries aimed at improving survival for patients with difficult-to-treat disease."

METHODS: Male Wistar rats at 12 weeks of age were divided into two groups (n=16/group): the Nx group, which underwent 5/6 nephrectomy, and the Sham group, as a control. After 5 weeks, the groups were subdivided according to diet (n=8/group): the Nx and Sham groups received a control diet; the Nx5% and Sham5% groups received a diet enriched with 5 % Brazil nuts for 8 weeks. The left ventricular thickening and chamber diameter were determined. Plasma biochemical parameters were evaluated. Analysis of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and antioxidant enzyme activity was performed in the plasma and the left ventricle (LV). LV mRNA expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The Nx5% group showed a remodeled LV wall with decreased thickness compared to the Nx group (p=0.016). Furthermore, LV TBARS concentration was reduced in the Nx5% group (p=0.0064). In addition, the Nx5% group showed an increase in plasma GPx activity (p=0.0431). No significant results were found concerning the LV mRNA expression of NF-κB and Nrf2 genes. CONCLUSIONS: A Brazil nut-enriched diet decreased LV thickness and LV TBARS concentration and increased GPx activity in a 5/6 nephrectomy experimental model, making it a promising adjuvant therapy to improve antioxidant status and cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease."

      "abstract": "The health benefits of nut consumption have been extensively demonstrated in observational studies and intervention trials. Besides the high nutritional value, countless evidences show that incorporating nuts into the diet may contribute to health promotion and prevention of certain diseases. Such benefits have been mostly and certainly attributed not only to their richness in healthy lipids (plentiful in unsaturated fatty acids), but also to the presence of a vast array of phytochemicals, such as polar lipids, squalene, phytosterols, tocochromanols, and polyphenolic compounds. Thus, many nut chemical compounds apply well to the designation \"nutraceuticals,\" a broad umbrella term used to describe any food component that, in addition to the basic nutritional value, can contribute extra health benefits. This contribution analyses the general chemical profile of groundnut and common tree nuts (almond, walnut, cashew, hazelnut, pistachio, macadamia, pecan), focusing on lipid components and phytochemicals, with a view on their bioactive properties. Relevant scientific literature linking consumption of nuts, and/or some of their components, with ameliorative and/or preventive effects on selected diseases - such as cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurodegenerative pathologies - was also reviewed. In addition, the bioactive properties were analyzed in the light of known mechanistic frameworks.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with low-grade inflammation and increased intestinal permeability (IP). The Brazil nut (BN) (Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K.) appears to be a promising dietary intervention to control inflammation by enhancing antioxidant defenses. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the effect of daily BN consumption on inflammatory biomarkers and IP in the context of an energy-restricted intervention. Furthermore, we evaluated the correlation between the changes in these inflammatory markers and the changes in serum selenium and IP. METHODS: In this 8-wk nonrandomized controlled trial, 56 women with overweight or obesity were allocated into 2 groups, both following an energy-restricted diet (-500 kcal/d). The control group (CO) consumed a nut-free diet, while the BN group consumed 8 g BN/d, providing 347.2 μg selenium (Se). Inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in plasma and Se in serum. IP was assessed using the lactulose/mannitol test (LM ratio). RESULTS: Forty-six women completed the intervention. Both groups achieved similar energy restriction (CO Δ= -253.7 ± 169.4 kcal/d; BN Δ= -265.8 ± 141.8 kcal/d) and weight loss (CO Δ= -2.5 ± 0.5 kg; BN Δ= -3.5 ± 0.5 kg). The BN group showed lower values of C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)1-β, IL-8, percentage lactulose excretion, and LM ratio than the CO group. Additionally, changes in serum Se concentration were predictive of changes in IL-8 concentration (β: -0.054; adjusted R2: 0.100; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.100; -0.007; P = 0.025), and changes in IL-8 were predictive of changes in the LM ratio (β: 0.006; adjusted R2: 0.101; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.011; P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Regular intake of BNs can be a promising complementary dietary strategy for controlling low-grade inflammation and improving IP in women with overweight/obesity undergoing energy-restricted treatment. However, the effects of BNs seem to be Se status-dependent. This trial was registered at the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC: https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-3ntxrm/.",

This study aimed to assess the effects of cashew nut and cashew nut oil on body fat (primary outcome) as well as adiposity, cardiometabolic and liver function markers (secondary outcomes). MATERIALS AND METHODS: An eight-week (8-wk) randomized controlled-feeding study involved 68 adults with overweight/obesity (40 women, BMI: 33 ± 4 kg/m2). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the energy-restricted (-500 kcal/d) groups: control (CT, free-nuts), cashew nut (CN, 30 g/d), or cashew nut oil (OL, 30 mL/d). Body weight, body composition, and blood collection were assessed at the baseline and endpoint of the study. RESULTS: After 8-wk, all groups reduced significantly body fat (CT: -3.1 ± 2.8 kg; CN: -3.3 ± 2.7 kg; OL: -1.8 ± 2.6 kg), body weight (CT: -4.2 ± 3.8 kg; CN: -3.9 ± 3.1 kg; OL: -3.4 ± 2.4 kg), waist (CT: -5.1 ± 4.6 cm; CN: -3.9 ± 3.9 cm; OL: -3.7 ± 5.3 cm) and hip circumferences (CT: -2.9 ± 3.0 cm; CN: -2.7 ± 3.1 cm; OL: -2.9 ± 2.3 cm). CN-group reduced liver enzymes (AST: -3.1 ± 5.3 U/L; ALT: -6.0 ± 9.9 U/L), while the OL-group reduced LDL-c (-11.5 ± 21.8 mg/dL) and atherogenic index (-0.2 ± 0.5). Both intervention groups decreased neck circumference (CN: -1.0 ± 1.2 cm; OL: -0.5 ± 1.2 cm) and apo B (CN: -6.6 ± 10.7 mg/dL; OL: -7.0 ± 15.3 mg/dL). CONCLUSION: After an 8-wk energy-restricted intervention, all groups reduced body fat (kg), weight, and some others adiposity indicators, with no different effect of cashew nut or cashew nut oil. However, participants in the intervention groups experienced additional reductions in atherogenic marker, liver function biomarkers, and cardiovascular risk factors (neck circumference and apo B levels), with these effects observed across the OL group, CN group, and both intervention groups, respectively.Clinical trial registration:https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-8xzkyp2, identifier 8xzkyp2."

We performed random-effects meta-analyses to compare nut-enriched diets vs. control diets for pre-post intervention changes. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system assessed the evidence's certainty. RESULTS: From the 5187 records identified, eight publications containing data referring to five randomized clinical trials involving 439 participants were included in the final analyses. The nuts evaluated were almonds, pecans, Brazil nuts, and mixed nuts, with doses ranging between 5 g and 85 g (median: 30 g/day). The intervention time varied between 6 and 12 weeks. Compared to nut-free diets, nut intake did not have a statistically significant effect on lipid profile biomarkers, except on the atherogenic index (MD: -0.32 [95% CI -0.58 to -0.06], I2 = 0% - moderate certainty of the evidence). Similarly, there was no effect of nuts on inflammatory profile biomarkers. It was not possible to aggregate data on adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Nut supplementation did not change lipid and inflammatory profiles in the secondary cardiovascular prevention setting.",

However, studies in individuals undergoing secondary cardiovascular prevention show controversial results. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review with meta-analysis assessed the effect of nut supplementation on anthropometric, glycemic, and blood pressure indices in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, as well as the frequency of adverse events. DATA SOURCES: Six databases were used for the search-PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, BVS (Biblioteca Virtual da Saude), Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov-until February 2023, with no language restrictions. DATA EXTRACTION: The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions methodology and the PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Setting/design) strategy were used. Seven independent reviewers were involved in data extraction and resolution of disagreements. Certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. DATA ANALYSIS: From 5187 records identified, 6 publications containing data referring to 5 randomized clinical trials (n = 436) were included in the final analyses. The nuts evaluated were almonds, pecans, Brazil nuts, and mixed nuts, with portions that varied between 5 g and 85 g (median: 30 g/day). The intervention period varied between 6 and 12 weeks. The nuts had no effect on fasting glucose and anthropometric indices, although the certainty of the evidence for most of these outcomes was low or very low. They also had no effect on systolic (mean difference [MD]: -1.16 mmHg [95% CI, -5.68 to 3.35], I2 = 0%-moderate certainty of evidence) or diastolic (MD: 0.10 mmHg [95% CI, -2.30 to 2.51], I2 = 0%-high certainty of evidence) blood pressure. It was not possible to aggregate data on adverse events. CONCLUSION: Nut supplementation had no effect on blood pressure, fasting glucose, or anthropometric profile in the context of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Nuts have the potential to inhibit α-amylase activity, and so lower postprandial glucose, due to their content of polyphenols and other bioactive compounds. We conducted a systematic literature review to assess the ability of extracts from commonly consumed edible parts of nuts to inhibit α-amylase. Among the 31 included papers, only four utilised human α-amylases. These papers indicated that polyphenol-rich chestnut skin extracts exhibited strong inhibition of both human salivary and pancreatic α-amylases, and that a polyphenol-rich almond skin extract was a potent inhibitor of human salivary α-amylase. The majority of the reviewed studies utilised porcine pancreatic α-amylase, which has ∼86% sequence homology with the corresponding human enzyme but with some key amino acid variations located within the active site. Polyphenol-rich extracts from chestnut, almond, kola nut, pecan and walnut, and peptides isolated from cashew, inhibited porcine pancreatic α-amylase. Some studies used α-amylases sourced from fungi or bacteria, outcomes from which are entirely irrelevant to human health, as they have no sequence homology with the human enzyme. Given the limited research involving human α-amylases, and the differences in inhibition compared to porcine enzymes and especially enzymes from microorganisms, it is recommended that future in vitro experiments place greater emphasis on utilising enzymes sourced from humans to facilitate a reliable prediction of effects in intervention studies.",

Does regional governance also play a role? This study examines the correlation between the quality of governance in European NUTS-2 regions and the spread of COVID-19. The findings indicate that overall perceived governance, and its perceived quality and corruption pillars, significantly impact the effectiveness of these interventions. This effect was pronounced during the first wave and then diminished in importance, disappearing before vaccines were available, suggesting that regional governance matters especially in the immediate aftermath of an exogenous shock.",

The PFAS may give rise to uncertainty about the potential severity of the future reactions, indications for prescribing epinephrine, and the extent of the necessary dietary avoidance. As a food allergy, secondary to cross-reactivity with airborne pollen, PFAS usually manifests toward the end of the first decade of life as contact urticaria of the oropharyngeal mucous membranes. Molecular allergology facilitates diagnosis and risk stratification by establishing the profile of sensitization. Exclusive sensitization to pathogenesis-related proteins family 10 (PR10) and profilins indicates that signs and symptoms are due to PFAS, whereas sensitization to seed storage proteins with or without sensitization to PR10 and profilins may indicate a more severe primary nut allergy phenotype. Management relies on avoidance of the specific nut trigger, advice on the likelihood of more severe local or systemic symptoms, and treatment of reactions according to the severity. Future studies are needed to better delineate the risk of systemic reactions in individuals with nut PFAS and to establish the role of food or pollen allergen immunotherapy for the prevention or moderation of this condition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased intestinal permeability and dysbiosis are related to obesity. Nuts can provide nutrients and bioactive compounds that modulate gut microbiota and inflammation, enhancing the beneficial effects of weight loss. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of consuming cashew nuts (Anacardium occidentale L.) and Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K) on intestinal permeability and microbiota, fecal SCFAs and pH, inflammation, and weight loss in energy restriction condition. METHODS: In this 8-week randomized controlled trial, 40 women with overweight or obesity were assigned to energy-restricted groups (-500 kcal/d): control group (free of nuts) or Brazilian nuts group (BN: 30 g of cashew nuts and 15 g of Brazil nuts per day). Permeability was analyzed by the lactulose/mannitol test and the microbiota by sequencing the 16S gene in the V3-V4 regions. Plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, IL-17A) and C-reactive protein were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 25 women completed the intervention. Both groups lost weight without statistical differences. Lactulose excretion increased only in the control group (P < 0.05). The BN consumption increased fecal propionic acid and potentially beneficial bacteria, such as Ruminococcus, Roseburia, strains NK4A214 and UCG-002 from the Ruminococcaceae family, but also Lachnospiraceae family, Bacteroides, and Lachnoclostridium, when compared to the control group. Changes in intestinal permeability were correlated to a greater reduction in body fat (kg), and IL-8, and increases in Ruminococcus abundance. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate a positive impact of BN consumption within an energy-restricted context, linked to the augmentation of potentially beneficial bacteria and pathways associated with body fat reduction. Besides, BN consumption mitigated increased intestinal permeability, although its capacity to diminish permeability or enhance weight loss proved limited. This trial was registered at the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials as ReBEC (ID: RBR-3ntxrm).",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetSx) and its chronic disease consequences are major public health concerns worldwide. Between-meal snacking may be a modifiable risk factor. We hypothesized that consuming tree nuts as snacks, versus typical carbohydrate snacks, would reduce risk for MetSx in young adults. A prospective, randomized, 16-week parallel-group diet intervention trial was conducted in 84 adults aged 22-36 with BMI 24.5 to 34.9 kg/m2 and ≥1 MetSx clinical risk factor. Tree nuts snacks (TNsnack) were matched to carbohydrate snacks (CHOsnack) for energy (kcal), protein, fiber, and sodium content as part of a 7-day eucaloric menu. Difference in change between groups was tested by analysis of covariance using general linear models. Multivariable linear regression modeling assessed main effects of TNsnack treatment and interactions between TNsnack and sex on MetSx score. Age, BMI, and year of study enrollment were included variables. There was a main effect of TNsnack on reducing waist circumference in females (mean difference: -2.20 ± 0.73 cm, p = 0.004) and a trend toward reduced visceral fat (-5.27 ± 13.05 cm2, p = 0.06). TNsnack decreased blood insulin levels in males (-1.14 ± 1.41 mIU/L, p = 0.05) and multivariable modeling showed a main effect of TNsnack on insulin. Main effects of TNsnack on triglycerides and TG/HDL ratio were observed (p = 0.04 for both) with TG/HDL ratio reduced ~11%. A main effect of TNsnack (p = 0.04) and an interaction effect between TNsnack and sex (p < 0.001) on total MetSx score yielded 67% reduced MetSx score in TNsnack females and 42% reduced MetSx score in TNsnack males. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized parallel-arm study to investigate cardiometabolic responses to TNsnacks versus typical CHOsnacks among young adults at risk of MetSx. Our study suggests daily tree nut consumption reduces MetSx risk by improving waist circumference, lipid biomarkers, and/or insulin sensitivity-without requiring caloric restriction.",

This study examined how the preharvest application of ethephon 480 SL® affects selected biochemical components and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in two macadamia nut cultivars: '788' and 'Beaumont'. Ethephon was applied to the trees via a Cima mist blower at rates of 13.33 mL/L per hectare for the '788' cultivar and 16.67 mL/L per hectare for the 'Beaumont'. Following harvest, the nuts were stored at 25 °C for 72 days, and samples were taken at 18-day intervals. Standard procedures were used to assess the following: total phenolics, total flavonoids, 2,2,-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, Ferric reducing ability power (FRAP) assay, sucrose, total protein, and PPO activities. This evaluation was carried out across a total of four treatments: ethephon-treated nuts from the orchard floor (ED), ethephon-treated nuts from the tree (ET), untreated nuts from the orchard floor (CD), and untreated nuts from the tree (CT). The evaluation's outcomes were analyzed using a principal component analysis (PCA), a correlation matrix heat map (CMHM), and a graphical assessment. The results unveiled significant correlations and associations among the assessed parameters. The correlation matrix heat map analysis highlighted a strong positive correlation (0.97) between the sucrose and the PPO activity in the 'Beaumont' cultivar, supported by the PCA analysis identifying the ED treatment as the most influential. At the storage period's conclusion, the ED treatment had the highest sucrose content (18.63 mg/g) and polyphenol oxidase activity (1.06 U g-1). In the '788' cultivar, a close relationship emerged between the phenolic content, the PPO activity, and the Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)'s antioxidant activity. Consistently, the CT treatment (untreated nuts) demonstrated positive correlations with several key parameters in both cultivars, displaying heightened phenolic content and antioxidant activities. Consequently, our findings indicate that the CT treatment, involving tree-harvested nuts without ethephon application, could be the preferred option for sustaining macadamia nuts' quality and shelf life compared to other methods. Moreover, our study underscores the significance of proper storage conditions for maintaining the desired biochemical parameters of macadamia nuts. By comprehending the effects of distinct treatments and harvesting techniques, producers and processors can devise strategies to optimize storage conditions and uphold macadamia nut quality."

This cross-sectional intervention study aimed to investigate whether a meticulously crafted meal plan for children of kindergarten age (5-6 years) could effectively enhance their daily intake of nutritious foods. Ninety-four healthy children from six kindergartens were enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to a prototype group (PG) and a control group (CG). The PG kindergartens (n = 4) received a prototype 5-day meal plan that included regulated portions of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and nuts adhering to dietary guidelines. Conversely, the CG kindergartens (n = 2) adhered to their standard meal plan. Participants maintained their usual eating habits outside of kindergarten and during weekends. Using the dietary assessment tool Open Platform for Clinical Nutrition (OPEN), combined with a 7-day dietary record of food consumed inside and outside the kindergarten, the average daily intake of specific food groups was assessed and compared with the Dietary Guidelines for Children. A total of 57 participants completed the study, 40 from the PG and 17 from the CG. Among the PG participants, the average daily intake of vegetables, whole grains, and nuts compared with the guideline recommendations was significantly higher than in the CG. Notably, only meals consumed within the kindergarten setting significantly improved the overall intake, with the outside intake having no significant effect. This study underscores the vital role of a well-designed and precisely executed meal plan in kindergartens in improving children's intake of healthy foods. The findings could help drive positive changes in child nutrition within educational environments.",

Additionally, unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs), such as eicosatrienoic acid + erucic acid (C20:3n3 + C22:1) and eicosatrienoic acid + alpha-linolenic acid (C20:1 + C18:3n3), were notably reduced. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed positive correlations between ethylene treatment and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in both 'Beaumont' (0.78) and '788' (0.80) cultivars. This also coincided with an increase in atherogenic indices, thrombogenic index, and saturation index and a decrease in the hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio and arachidonic acid (C20:4n6) within the ED group of the 'Beaumont' cultivar, collectively potentially impacting nutritional quality negatively. Furthermore, our findings indicated that the PUFA:SFA ratio was higher in CD (0.51) compared to ED (0.45) on day 72 for the 'Beaumont' cultivar, revealing differences in fatty acid compositions between the two treatment groups. Conversely, for '788', both ED and CD had a PUFA:SFA ratio below 0.45, indicating an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. These results suggest that ethephon treatment increases SFA levels and reduces USFA levels in the 'Beaumont' cultivar, while the response to ethylene varies between the two cultivars. Thus, the study provides insight into the significant role of modifying ethephon treatment methods and careful cultivar selection in the attainment of optimal nutritional value and shelf-life of macadamia nuts."

      "abstract": "The demand for tree nuts has significantly grown in recent years as epidemiological studies and clinical intervention trials demonstrated an inverse relationship between tree nut consumption and chronic diseases. However, mycotoxins are one of the main hazards responsible for increased \"Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed\" (RASFF) notifications and border rejections on nuts and nut products exported to the E.U. countries in the past few years. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites that present serious threats to human and animal health. The most prevalent, toxic, and carcinogenic mycotoxins observed in human food and animal feed are the aflatoxins (AFs). This work analyzed notifications from the RASFF on nuts and nut products contaminated with mycotoxins, for a 10-year period from 2011 to 2021. A total of 4752 mycotoxin notifications were published on RASFF for food products worldwide, 63% (n = 3000) were notified in \"nuts, nut products and seeds\". It was observed that 95% (n = 2669) notifications were due to AFs. Over half of these notifications (52%, n = 1545) were reported for groundnuts, where 29% (n = 441) of the notifications were received for groundnuts from China alone. Border rejection was reported for 91% (n = 2560) of the nuts and nut products which received the notifications from the E.U. countries. This study proffers understanding into the major reasons for RASFF notifications on nuts and nut products exported to E.U. countries. Also, the implications of this issue with some recommendations that could reduce the incidents of notifications for tree nuts have been outlined.",

Dexamethasone (DEX) can effectively alleviate the inflammatory response in RA, but the severe adverse effects that occur after its long-term administration limit its clinical development. Herein, we propose a Ca-DEX biomineralization-inducing nut (CaCO3-DEX) with controlled release properties for mitigating the toxic side effects of DEX in RA treatment, especially the damage to cartilage and bone. CaCO3-DEX releases the drug and Ca2+ preferentially in an inflammatory environment. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that CaCO3-DEX significantly reduces the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors and inhibits ROS production in vitro, as well as demonstrates superior pro-biomineralization and osteogenic differentiation potential. In the collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis model (CIA model), CaCO3-DEX significantly reduces the clinical score of arthritis in mice, and the imaging results show a noticeable relief of edema and bone erosion in CIA model mice treated with CaCO3-DEX, while inflammatory factors at the injury areas are significantly reduced, which provides favorable protection to cartilage and bone.",

      "abstract": "Many emerging factors and circumstances urge the need to develop and optimize the detection and quantification techniques of mycotoxins in solid food and feed. The diversity of mycotoxins, which have different properties and affinities, makes the standardization of the analytical procedures and the adoption of a single protocol that covers the attributes of all mycotoxins a tedious or even an impossible mission. Several modifications and improvements have been undergone in order to optimize the performance of these methods including the extraction solvents, the extraction methods, the clean-up procedures, and the analytical techniques. The techniques range from the rapid screening methods, which lack sensitivity and specificity such as TLC, to a spectrum of more advanced protocols, namely, ELISA, HPLC, and GC-MS and LC-MS/MS. This review aims at assessing the current studies related to these analytical techniques of mycotoxins in solid food and feed. It discusses and evaluates, through a critical approach, various sample treatment techniques, and provides an in-depth examination of different mycotoxin detection methods. Furthermore, it includes a comparison of their actual accuracy and a thorough analysis of the observed benefits and drawbacks.",

      "abstract": "Tree nuts, a low-moisture food, are typically perceived as being a low risk for foodborne illness. In the past five decades, the consumption of tree nuts (dry, soaked, or as nut-based dairy analogs [NBDA]) has increased along with corresponding foodborne illness outbreaks and recalls associated with these products. We developed an online survey to assess tree nut handling practices of U.S. consumers, and to select study participants who have soaked tree nuts and/or made NBDA at home. We distributed our initial survey questions in October 2021 to a convenience sample (n = 12) to test for clarity and comprehension. In January 2022, participants (n = 981) who met the criteria completed the survey. The most popular soaked tree nuts were almonds (54%), followed by cashews (36%), walnuts (32%), and pistachios (22%). Participants soaked tree nuts for direct consumption (67%) and during the preparation of NBDA (80%). Participants soaked tree nuts under refrigerated conditions for 1-24 h (22%), on the countertop at room temperature (est. 65-75°F [18-24°C]) for 1-5 h (21%), or at room temperature for 12 h or more (6%); 16% used a hot or boiling water, short time treatment. Some participants added acid (28%) or salt (25%) to the soaking water. Among those participants who dried their tree nuts after soaking (63%), 89% reported drying at a temperature lower than 46°C (115°F). Some participants (34%) used their tree nuts to make fermented dairy analogs (e.g., \"cheese\" or \"yogurt\") by adding \"probiotics\" (56-86%) or a yogurt starter culture (37-99%), respectively, and then, most frequently, holding at or below 20°C (68°F) for 12 h or less (29%). The safety of many of these practices has not been adequately investigated, but the findings of this study will inform future risk assessment and risk modeling studies on tree nut food safety in home kitchen settings.",

However, the intake of typical Brazilian nuts and its acute effect on cardiovascular health needs to be better understood. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the acute effect of a beverage containing cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) and Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K.) on postprandial oxidative stress, lipemia, and blood pressure of adult women aged 20 to 55 years with cardiometabolic risk. This was an acute, randomized, parallel arm, controlled clinical trial. The participants received either a beverage containing nuts (30 g Brazil nuts + 15 g cashew nuts) or a beverage without nuts with similar macronutrient composition. Oxidative stress markers and lipid profiles were evaluated at fasting and 4 h after beverage consumption. Blood pressure was measured during fasting and after beverage intake (1, 2, 3, and 4 h). In the postprandial state, there was a greater reduction in malondialdehyde levels in the intervention group compared to the control group (-12.3 ± 0.59 vs. -10.7 ± 0.43 µmol/mL; p < 0.05), which was positively correlated with the concentrations of TG (r = 0.399; p < 0.05), VLDL (r = 0.399; p < 0.05), TG/HDL (r = 0.380; p < 0.05), and blood pressure (iAUC SBP r = 0.391; p < 0.05, iAUC DBP r = 0.409; p < 0.05). The remaining oxidative stress markers showed similar postprandial changes between groups. In women with cardiometabolic risk, a beverage containing Brazilian nuts promoted a significant acute reduction on postprandial malondialdehyde levels. The study was registered in the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry-ReBEC (protocol: RBR-3ntxrm).",

Efforts to find new therapeutic approaches are warranted to improve treatment options. Therefore, the purpose of this communication includes the phytochemical screening of a methanolic extract of Garcinia kola nuts and the in vivo evaluation of its biological activity against rats infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei and treated with 4 different concentrations of the extract (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg). Treatment with suramin served as a positive control, while the negative control received no drug. Since the general toxicity of the extract could be ruled out, efficacy was evaluated based on physiological changes, such as induction of trypanosome parasitemia, influence on body temperature, and body weight. Survival was assessed during this study. Physical parameters, behavioral characteristics, and various hematological indices were also monitored. Based on the (patho)physiological and behavioral parameters (e.g., no parasitemia, no increase in body temperature, an increase in body weight, no loss of condition, no alopecia, and no gangrene), the efficacy of the extract was evident, which was also confirmed by 100% survival, while in the negative control, all rats died during the observation period. Since overall very similar results were obtained as a result of treatment with the established suramin, the in vivo antitrypanosomal activity of a methanolic extract of G. kola nuts on rats can be demonstrated in this communication. This opens the way, for example, for further development of drug formulations based on this methanolic extract."

However, the relationship between nuts, a key food group of Mediterranean diet, and frailty is unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the association between nut consumption and frailty in an aging female population. METHODS: This population-based observational study included nonfrail women (≥60 y old) in the NHS from 11 states of the United States. Outcome was incident frailty, defined as having ≥3 of the FRAIL components (fatigue, lower strength, reduced aerobic capacity, multiple chronic conditions, and significant weight loss) and assessed every 4 y from 1992 to 2016. From 1990 to 2014, FFQs were used to assess the intakes of peanuts, peanut butter, walnuts (added in 1998), and other nuts at 4-y intervals. Exposure was total nut consumption, calculated as the sum of intakes of peanuts, peanut butter, walnuts, and other nuts and categorized into <1 serving/mo, 1-3 servings/mo, 1 serving/wk, 2-4 servings/wk, and ≥5 servings/wk. The relations of intakes of peanuts, peanut butter, and walnuts with frailty were also investigated separately. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations between nut consumption and frailty after adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, EI, diet quality, and medication use. RESULTS: Among 71,704 participants, 14,195 incident frailty cases occurred over 1,165,290 person-years. The adjusted HR (95% CI) for consuming ≥5 servings/wk of nuts was 0.80 (0.73, 0.87), as compared with <1 serving/mo. Higher intakes of peanuts and walnuts, but not peanut butter, were also inversely associated with frailty. CONCLUSIONS: This large prospective cohort study showed a strong and consistent inverse association between regular nut consumption and incident frailty. This suggests that nut consumption should be further tested as a convenient public health intervention for the preservation of health and well-being in older adults.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation are mediators in the pathophysiology of several non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Tree nuts and peanuts lower risk factors of cardiometabolic disease, including blood lipids, blood pressure and insulin resistance, among others. Given their strong antioxidant/anti-inflammatory potential, it is plausible that nuts may also exert a favorable effect on inflammation and oxidative stress. Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest a modest protective effect of total nuts; however, the evidence is inconsistent for specific nut types. In this narrative review, the state of evidence to date is summarized for the effect of nut intake on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress, and an attempt is made to define the gaps in research while providing a framework for future research. Overall, it appears that some nuts, such as almonds and walnuts, may favorably modify inflammation, and others, such as Brazil nuts, may favorably influence oxidative stress. There is a pressing need for large RCTs with an adequate sample size that consider different nut types, and the dose and duration of nut intervention, while evaluating a robust set of biomarkers for inflammation and oxidative stress. Building a stronger evidence base is important, especially since oxidative stress and inflammation are mediators of many NCDs and can benefit both personalized and public health nutrition.",

      "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that the consumption of mixed tree nuts (MTNs) during caloric restriction decreased cardiovascular risk factors and increased satiety. Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism has been indicated as a factor in cardiovascular disease. Here, we investigated the effect of MTNs on Trp metabolism and the link to cardiovascular risk markers. Plasma and stool were collected from 95 overweight individuals who consumed either MTNs (or pretzels) daily as part of a hypocaloric weight loss diet for 12 weeks followed by an isocaloric weight maintenance program for an additional 12 weeks. Plasma and fecal samples were evaluated for Trp metabolites by LC-MS and for gut microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing. Trp-kynurenine metabolism was reduced only in the MTNs group during weight loss (baseline vs. week 12). Changes in Trp-serotonin (week 24) and Trp-indole (week 12) metabolism from baseline were increased in the MTNs group compared to the pretzel group. Intergroup analysis between MTN and pretzel groups does not identify significant microbial changes as indicated by alpha diversity and beta diversity. Changes in the relative abundance of genus Paludicola during intervention are statistically different between the MTNs and pretzel group with p < 0.001 (q = 0.07). Our findings suggest that consumption of MTNs affects Trp host and microbial metabolism in overweight and obese subjects.",

      "abstract": "Gamma irradiation has been applied as an efficient and inexpensive method for the sterilization of nuts for years. However, along with the benefits of such treatment, negative effects are possible because of the formation of reactive oxygen species with a toxic effect on important biologically active substances. Because of the scarce and contradictory information in the literature about gamma-irradiated almonds, the aim of our work was the examination of the lipid changes, antioxidant activity, and oxidative stability of almonds treated by 10 and 25 kGy gamma rays, as well as changes in intensity of the EPR spectra as an indicator for the stability of radiation-induced free radicals. The results revealed no significant differences in the EPR spectra of almonds treated at 10 and 25 kGy doses, neither in their intensity nor in kinetic behaviour. The EPR signals decayed exponentially over 250 days, with a decreasing of central line by 90%, with satellite lines by about 73%. No significant changes in the fat content, fatty acids composition, and acid value of irradiated almonds were observed. However, the amount of (alpha)tocopherols decreased from 292 to 175 mg/kg, whereas the conjugated dienes and trienes increased, K232 from 1.3 to 3 and K268 from 0.04 to 0.15, respectively, with the increasing of irradiation dose. The same was observed for total polyphenols in defatted almonds (1374 to 1520 mg/100 g), where in vitro antioxidant activity determined by ORAC and HORAC methods increased from 100 to 156 µmol TE/g and from 61 to 86 µmol GAE/g, respectively. The oxidative stability of oil decreased from 6 to 4 h at 120 °C and from 24.6 to 18.6 h at 100 °C (measured by Rancimat equipment). The kinetic parameters characterizing the oxidative stability of oil from 10 kGy irradiated almonds were studied before and after addition of different concentrations of ascorbyl palmitate as a synergist of tocopherols. Its effectiveness was concentration-dependent, and 0.75 mM ensured the same induction period as that of non-irradiated nut oil. Further enrichment with alpha-tocopherol in equimolar ratio with palmitate did not improve the oil stability. In conclusion, gamma irradiation is an appropriate method for the treatment of almonds without significant changes in fat content and fatty acids composition. The decreasing of oxidative stability after higher irradiation could be prevented by the addition of ascorbyl palmitate.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis are regulated by cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. Current treatments for these conditions are associated with significant side effects and do not completely suppress inflammation. The benefits of diet, especially the role of specific components, are poorly understood. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have several beneficial health effects. The majority of studies on PUFAs have been on omega-3 fatty acids. This review will focus on a less studied fatty acid, pinolenic acid (PNLA) from pine nuts, which typically constitutes up to 20% of its total fatty acids. PNLA is emerging as a dietary PUFA and a promising supplement in the prevention of inflammatory disorders or as an alternative therapy. Some studies have shown the health implications of pine nuts oil (PNO) and PNLA in weight reduction, lipid-lowering and anti-diabetic actions as well as in suppression of cell invasiveness and motility in cancer. However, few reviews have specifically focused on the biological and anti-inflammatory effects of PNLA. Furthermore, in recent bioinformatic studies on human samples, the expression of many mRNAs and microRNAs was regulated by PNLA indicating potential transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of inflammatory and metabolic processes. The aim of this review is to summarize, highlight, and evaluate research findings on PNO and PNLA in relation to potential anti-inflammatory benefits and beneficial metabolic changes. In this context, the focus of the review is on the potential actions of PNLA on inflammation along with modulation of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress based on data from both in vitro and in vivo experiments, and human findings, including gene expression analysis.",

Therefore, we hypothesize that nuts could be associated with greater weight loss in comparison to a control group, and we evaluate the acute and long-term effects of Brazilian nuts (BN: 15 g of Brazil nuts + 30 g of cashew nuts) included in an energy-restricted intervention on food intake, appetite, and peptide hormones. We conducted an 8-week, randomized, open-label, controlled, parallel-arm clinical trial with 28 women at cardiometabolic risk who received an energy-restricted diet containing BN or an energy-restricted nut-free diet (control). At baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention, subjective postprandial appetite ratings were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) before and after consumption (0, 10, 60, 120, 180, and 240 minutes) of a 437-kcal nut-enriched (BN group) or nut-free (control) breakfast meal. Subsequently, an ad libitum lunch was served, and the participants completed another VAS at 280 minutes. Plasma concentrations of ghrelin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide 1, and leptin were measured at fasting and postprandially at 60, 120, and 240 minutes. Last, subsequent reported 24-hour energy intake was assessed in a free-living setting. BN consumption did not have acute effects on food intake, appetite, or peptide hormones. However, after an 8-week intervention, postprandial ghrelin (difference between post- and preintervention area under the curve) decreased in the BN group in comparison to the control (mean difference, 1978 pg/mL/min, 95% CI, 27-3929 pg/mL/min; P = .047) and therefore, an energy-restricted diet containing demonstrated potential to decrease hunger in cardiometabolic risk women.",

In this study, the effect of exogenous ethylene on amino acids metabolism and related genes expression in Torreya grandis were investigated. The results revealed that ethylene treatment (3000 μL L-1 for 24 h) significantly increased amino acids level. Umami amino acids were distinctly upregulated in ethylene-treated versus control nuts, with glutamic and aspartic acids to demonstrate 1.9-fold and 2.1-fold increase. Transcriptome analysis revealed that deferentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism. RT-qPCR confirmed that ethylene treatment up-regulated expression of their biosynthesis genes (TgGOGAT1, TgAATC1, TgAATC4) concurrent with suppression of their degradation enzymes (TgGS2, TgGAD1, TgGAD3, TgASNS1). Ethylene treatment appears to promote umami taste-active amino acids and improve T. grandis nut quality post-harvest.",

      "abstract": "Nuts are widely consumed worldwide, mainly due to their characteristic flavor and texture, ease of consumption, and their functional properties. In addition, consumers increasingly demand natural or slightly processed foods with high quality. Consequently, non-thermal treatments are a viable alternative to thermal treatments used to guarantee safety and long shelf life, which produce undesirable changes that affect the sensory quality of nuts. Non-thermal treatments can achieve results similar to those of the traditional (thermal) ones in terms of food safety, while ensuring minimal loss of bioactive compounds and sensory properties, thus obtaining a product as similar as possible to the fresh one. This article focuses on a review of the main non-thermal treatments currently available for nuts (cold plasma, high pressure, irradiation, pulsed electric field, pulsed light, ultrasound and ultraviolet light) in relation to their effects on the quality and safety of nuts. All the treatments studied have shown promise with regard to the inhibition of the main microorganisms affecting nuts (e.g., Aspergillus, Salmonella, and E. coli). Furthermore, by optimizing the treatment, it is possible to maintain the organoleptic and functional properties of these products."

      "abstract": "The effective food processing to reduce nuts and legumes allergenicity could not be easily and directly concluded from reading a few published reports. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate this issue. A literature search was conducted in eight electronic databases from January 2000 to June 11, 2021. The primary outcome of interest was the allergenicity of processed nuts or legumes determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from in vitro studies. Data with the standardized mean difference (SMD) of 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled using a random-effect model by RevMan 5.4 software. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q (PQ ) and I2 tests. The search strategy identified 18,793 articles. However, only 61 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. There were 21 and 15 types of respective single and combined food processing treatments analyzed for their effects on reducing allergenicity. In single processing treatment, the extrusion and fermentation had the largest reduction in allergenicity, considering their SMD value, that is, -20.19 (95% CI: -22.22 to -18.17; the certainty of evidence: moderate) and -20.8 (95% CI: -24.10 to -17.50; the certainty of evidence: moderate), respectively. Whereas in the combination, the treatment of fermentation followed by proteolytic hydrolysis showed the most significant reduction (SMD: -53.34; 95% CI: -70.18 to -36.5) and the evidence quality of this treatment was considered moderate. In conclusion, these three food processing methods showed a desirable impact in reducing nuts or legumes allergenicity. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Nuts and legumes play an essential role as protein sources in food consumption worldwide, but they usually contain allergens. Our study has investigated the food processing methods that effectively reduce their allergenicity by meta-analysis. The result gives valuable information for further laboratory investigation on allergens and can be used by food industries in providing foods from nuts and legumes with lower allergenicity.",

Consequently, there is a growing need for easily available and sustainable sources, as well as for green extraction methodologies of these compounds. Herein, a ball milling/deep eutectic solvent (DES)-based treatment is reported as an efficient strategy for the recovery of antioxidant lignins from the shells of edible nuts, namely chestnuts, hazelnuts, peanuts, pecan nuts, and pistachios. In particular, preliminarily ball-milled shells were treated with 1:2 mol/mol choline chloride:lactic acid at 120 °C for 24 h, and the extracted material was recovered in 19-27% w/w yields after precipitation by the addition of 0.01 M HCl. Extensive spectroscopic and chromatographic analysis allowed for confirmation that the main phenolic constituents present in the shell extracts were lignins, accompanied by small amounts (0.9% w/w) of ellagic acid, in the case of chestnut shells. The recovered samples exhibited very promising antioxidant properties, particularly in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay (EC50 values ranging from 0.03 to 0.19 mg/mL). These results open new perspectives for the valorization of nut shells as green sources of lignins for applications as antioxidants, e.g., in the biomedical, food, and/or cosmetic sector."

However, there is a lack of basic research based on mixed nut formulation. This study established a new method for optimizing mixed nut formulations using the Nutrient Rich Food (NRF) index model. Nutrient indices were adjusted by combining 10 and 8 encouraging nutrients and 3 limiting nutrients of nuts and dried fruits, respectively. The optimized mixed nut formulation had the highest total NRF and the lowest energy, which was achieved by applying linear programming. The effect of an optimized mixed nut formulation on insulin resistance and gut microbiota was investigated in an animal model of metabolic disorders caused by a high-fat diet. Male C57BL/6J mice (n = 12 per group) were fed a low-fat diet, a high-fat diet (HFD), HFD with a supplemented classical randomized controlled trial mixed nut formula (MN1), a commercially available mixed nut formula (MN2), a high-nutrient density mixed nut formula (MN3), or ellagic acid (positive control). MN3 treatment decreased total plasma cholesterol, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and zonulin levels, strengthened the intestinal barrier, and significantly altered the β-diversity of the intestinal microbiota as compared to the HFD group. These effects of MN3 were superior to MN1 and MN2. In conclusion, MN3 had the highest nutrient density and improved insulin resistance in low-grade inflammation via gut microbiota remodeling.",

The result revealed the nut astringency was primarily enriched in the seed coat with more soluble tannins. The NaHCO3 treatment greatly shortened the de-astringency process, as indicated by a faster conversion of soluble tannins to insoluble tannins and more acetaldehyde production. Besides, a total of 293 metabolites, including 92 phenolic acids and 37 flavonoids, were tentatively characterized in the seed coat. A further comparative analysis of the metabolomics indicated epigallocatechin, gallocatechin, catechin, procyanidin B1, B2, B3 and C1 to be the major metabolites influenced by the NaHCO3 treatment.

Moreover, various factors, including cultivar, climate, soil characteristic, storage and treatment have influence on the chemical composition of nuts. Therefore, nine tree nut types and peanuts commonly available on Polish market were evaluated for phenolic profile and mineral elements content. The concentration of individual phenolic compounds, including flavonoids, aromatic acids and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) was determined by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography, while the content of macro-elements and trace minerals was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. The phenolic profile of analyzed nuts substantially varied depending on the type of nut. The highest total content of all analyzed flavonoids was determined in walnuts (114.861 µg/g), while the lowest in almonds (1.717 µg/g). In turn, the highest total content of all tested aromatic acid was determined in pecans (33.743 µg/g), and the lowest in almonds (0.096 µg/g). Epicatechin and cinnamic acid were detected in the highest concentration in tested nuts. Moreover, in examined nuts (except walnuts and Brazil nuts), the presence of CAPE was confirmed. The tested nuts were also characterized by wide variation in element concentrations. Almonds contained high concentration of macro-elements (13,111.60 µg/g), while high content of trace elements was determined in pine nuts (192.79 µg/g). The obtained results indicate that the tested nuts are characterized by a significant diversity in the content of both phenolic compounds and minerals.

      "abstract": "Drought stress, an important abiotic stress, has affected global agricultural production by limiting the yield and the quality of crops. Tiger nuts (Cyperus esculentus L.) are C4 crops in the Cyperaceae family, which have high-quality wholesome ingredients. However, data on mechanisms underlying the response of tiger nuts to drought stress are few. Here, the variety of Jisha 1 and 15% polyethylene glycol (PEG; a drought stress simulator) were used to study the mechanisms of stress response in tiger nuts. Our evaluation of the changes in physiological indicators such as electrolyte leakage (El), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (O2-) and activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) showed that 12 h was the most suitable time point to harvest and analyze the response to drought stress. Thereafter, we performed transcriptome (RNA-Seq) analysis in the control (CK) and stress treatment groups and showed that there was a total of 1760 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in abscisic acid (ABA) terms, and pathways such as starch and sucrose metabolism (ko00500), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (ko00940) and plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075) were significantly enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the DEGs demonstrated an upregulation of ABA and lignin content, as well as enzyme activities in enriched pathways, which validated the RNA-Seq data. These results revealed the pathways and mechanisms adopted by the tiger nuts in response to drought stress."

Color, respiration rates, moisture content (MC), and oxidation markers, such as peroxide value (PV), acidity value (AV), and volatile compounds (VC), were evaluated. During six months of storage, the MC decreased in all CA treatments, and treatments at 10 °C had the lowest AVs and PVs. However, the treatment with high pCO2 levels also guaranteed lower AVs at 20 °C. The color parameter b* (yellow), which is related to the golden appearance of pecans and is a highly desirable visual attribute in the commercialization of nuts, was maintained high in treatments at 10 °C with CA treatments until six months of storage. The VCs, characteristic of lipid oxidation (aldehydes, acids, alcohols, and ketones), increase in all treatments with prolonging storage. When pCO2 was associated to 10 °C at six month of storage, it showed a larger area in the acids and unsaturated aldehyde classes, while it was relevant for alcohols, lactones, and esters at 20 °C, with sweet characteristics, including ethyl ethanoate, ethyl hexanoate, and butyrolactone. Thus, this study shows another advance in the storage techniques of shelled pecans, pointing to alternatives for reducing energy costs in the cooling chain.",

The most predominant fungal genera in nuts were Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Rhizopus. Ozone (4 ppm) significantly reduced the fungal sporulation of A. flavus and their aflatoxin production. Interestingly, ozone treatment of nuts reduced the total fungal count and increased aflatoxins degradation by approximately 95% and 85%, respectively. Ozone displayed high efficiency to increase the permeability of cell membrane and injury of cell wall of fungi. Increasing the exposure time of ozone in nuts up to 180 minutes showed to reduce the total lipid, carbohydrates, and protein by around 41.2%, 42.7% and 38.4% respectively, in pistachio, almond and peanuts.

We examined the effect of gaseous O3 (50-200 ppm; 30 min; 6 L/min) on (a) in vitro germination, (b) mycelial growth, and (c) aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production on a milled pistachio nut-based medium at different water activity (aw) levels and at 30 °C. This was complimented with in situ studies exposing raw pistachio nuts to 50-200 ppm of O3. Exposure of conidia to gaseous O3 initially resulted in lower germination percentages at different aw levels. However, 12 h after treatment, conidial viability recovered with 100% germination after 24-48 h. Growth rates of mycelial colonies were slightly decreased with the increase of the O3 dose, with significant inhibition only at 0.98 aw. The production of AFB1 after O3 treatment and storage for 10 days was stimulated in A. flavus colonies at 0.98 aw. Raw pistachio nuts inoculated with A. flavus conidia prior to O3 exposure showed a significant decrease in population after 20 days of storage. However, AFB1 contamination was stimulated in most O3 treatments. The relationship between exposure concentration, time and prevailing aw levels on toxin control needs to be better understood for these nuts.",

We aimed to summarize the findings of previous studies to evaluate the impact of nuts consumption on glycaemic and lipid profile, inflammation, and oxidative stress. METHODS: Electronic searches for observational and intervention studies were undertaken in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Science Direct until 2022 for searching the studies aiming the application of different types of nuts and the beneficial effects of nuts in improving glycemia, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress. RESULTS: Results from 56 interventional, 9 narrative and 3 systematic reviews, and 12 meta-analysis studies, aiming at the evaluating beneficial effects of different types of nuts on metabolic markers, showed that nut consumption could improve metabolic markers, including glycaemic factors, lipid profile, and inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters in both healthy and individuals with metabolic disorders in a type-, dose- and duration-dependent manner. According to their unique nutrient components, nuts can be known as a part of a healthy diet, resulting in improved metabolic biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Considering the efficacy of nuts in improving metabolic markers, incorporation of, incorporating nuts the effectiveness of nuts in improving metabolic markers, incorporating nuts in the diet may prevent the incidence or aggravation of chronic metabolic diseases. Considering the health benefits of the nuts' components, including essential micronutrients, if consumed in the appropriate dose and duration to provide the necessary amount of effective micronutrients to improve health, we will see an improvement in metabolic factors. At the same time, more research is required to determine the optimal type, dose, and duration of nut intervention with regards to metabolic control and reducing the risk of developing metabolic disorders."

Oxidative stress is among the processes thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of the damage produced by HHcy. HHcy is likely to involve the dysfunction of several organs, such as the kidney, liver, or gut, which are currently poorly understood. Nuts are regarded as an important part of a balanced diet since they include protein, good fatty acids, and critical nutrients. The aim of this work was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of cashew nuts in HHcy induced by oral methionine administration for 30 days, and to examine the possible pathways involved. In HHcy rats, cashew nuts (100 mg/kg orally, daily) were able to counteract clinical biochemical changes, oxidative and nitrosative stress, reduced antioxidant enzyme levels, lipid peroxidation, proinflammatory cytokine release, histological tissue injuries, and apoptosis in the kidney, colon, and liver, possibly by the modulation of the antioxidant nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 NRF-2 and inflammatory nuclear factor NF-kB pathways. Thus, the results suggest that the consumption of cashew nuts may be beneficial for the treatment of inflammatory conditions associated with HHcy.",

      "abstract": "Tree nuts, including Brazil nuts, have been hypothesized to impact cardiovascular health through the modulation of oxidative stress and inflammation. Nonetheless, a quantitative analysis of these effects has not been performed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically revise and quantify the effect of Brazil nut intervention on selenium status, blood lipids, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation using a meta-analytical approach. To meet the goals of this study, a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases of published randomised clinical trials reporting on dietary interventions with Brazil nuts and their effects on selenium status, blood lipids, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation was performed. Eight articles were included for systematic review and meta-analysis. Based on the conducted analysis, a significant positive effect of Brazil nuts on selenium blood concentration (SMD = 6.93, 95% CI: 3.99; 9.87) was found. Additionally, a positive effect of Brazil nut intervention on glutathione peroxidase activity (SMD = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.07; 0.99) was observed. However, no significant results were found when considering blood lipid levels, including results for total cholesterol (SMD = -0.22, 95% CI: -0.57; 0.14), HDL cholesterol (SMD = -0.04, 95% CI: -0.28; 0.19) and LDL cholesterol (SMD = -0.15; 95% CI: -0.43; 0.13). In conclusion, the findings from this study suggest that Brazil nut consumption improves selenium status and exerts antioxidant effects, which could be considered a potential pathway for the prevention of metabolic disorders related to altered blood lipid profiles. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the effect of Brazil nuts toward blood lipid profile, also preferably controlling for other biomarkers."

We aim to evaluate the effect of these nuts within an energy-restricted diet on body weight, body composition, cardiometabolic markers, and endothelial function in cardiometabolic risk women. Brazilian nuts study is a randomized controlled parallel 8-week dietary intervention trial. Forty women were randomly allocated to 1) Control group: Energy-restricted diet without nuts, n= 19 or, 2) Brazil and cashew nuts group (BN-Group): Energy-restricted diet containing daily 45 g of nuts (15 g of Brazil nuts + 30g of cashew nuts), n= 21. At the beginning and final intervention, anthropometry, body composition, and blood pressure were measured. Fasting blood sampling was obtained to evaluate lipid profile, glucose homeostasis, and endothelial function markers. After 8-week, plasma selenium concentration increased in BN-group (∆ = + 31.5 ± 7.8 μg/L; p= 0.001). Brazil and cashew nuts intake reduced total body fat (-1.3 ± 0.4 %) parallel to improvement of lean mass percentage in BN-group compared to the control. Besides, the soluble adhesion molecule VCAM-1 decreased (24.03 ± 15.7 pg/mL vs. -22.2 ± 10.3 pg/mL; p= 0.019) after Brazil and cashew nuts intake compared to the control. However, lipid and glucose profile markers, apolipoproteins, and blood pressure remained unchanged after the intervention. Thus, the addition of Brazil and cashew nuts to an energy-restricted diet can be a healthy strategy to improve body composition, selenium status, and endothelial inflammation in cardiometabolic risk women."

The present study evaluated the effect of MW irradiation on the occurrence of moulds in nuts and almonds. Samples of unshelled natural almonds, pistachios, and in-shell peanuts were treated with different doses of MW irradiation (2400-4000 W). The effect of MW irradiation on mould counts was evaluated by cultivating immediately after irradiation and after 3 and 6 months of storage. The most represented genera in all analysed samples were Aspergillus (68%), Penicillium (21%), and a small amount of Cladosporium (3%). Mould numbers significantly decreased after MW treatment. The treatments with MW irradiations at 3000 and 4000 W significantly reduced the mould colony counts, and their effect persisted during storage; irradiation at 2400 W was partially effective. The strongest effect of MW irradiation was observed in in-shell peanuts. MW irradiation seems to be a promising method for maintaining the microbiological quality of nuts."

      "abstract": "For the first time, the volatiles of three varieties of fresh and roasted Torreya yunnanensis nuts were investigated by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results indicated that roasting had the greatest effect on the volatiles of millet capsules. Fresh nuts had many terpenes, esters, and aldehydes, while roasting led to the formation of pyrazines and furans. In subsequent work, short-term low temperature and small sample area exposed to high temperature had a large effect on the increase in some volatiles and was characterized by a green flavor, such as α-pinene, while ultrahigh-temperature (200 and 230°C) resulted in a decrease in the total volatiles with the generation of unpleasant flavors. Finally, the combination of 170°C for 40 min and slight crushing was found to be the best roasting conditions for samples by means of GC-MS and two-dimensional gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC/TOF-MS). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Torreya yunnanensis and its nuts have broad development prospects because of their wide use and rich nutrition. However, inappropriate processing and lack of attention to natural materials such as nuts and wood leads to their poor usage. In addition, volatile compounds make a major contribution to the nut aroma, which is an important indicator of their sensory quality. However, no one has applied roasting technology to Torreya yunnanensis nuts or studied the volatile compounds of the roasted nuts. This study revealed the changes in the composition and content of volatile compounds in Torreya yunnanensis nuts before and after roasting, and the influence of different process points, suggesting that they are key contributors to the development of the related products.",

Limited studies have examined the association between nuts and legumes as a food group and metabolic syndrome. This study explored the association between nuts and legumes and components of metabolic syndrome in Iranian nurses. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included a representative sample of 420 female nurses of Isfahan who were randomly selected. Nuts and legumes consumption was assessed using a validated dish-based semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Metabolic syndrome was defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). Linear and logistic regression tests were used to study the association between nuts and legumes consumption and metabolic syndrome and its components. RESULTS: Mean age of study participants was 35 years. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among study participants was 3.6%. Consumption of nuts and legumes was not associated with waist circumference either before (β = -0.01, P = 0.24) or after adjusting for potential confounders (β = -0.18, P = 0.41). The same findings were also observed for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (β = 0.001, P = 0.42), serum triglyceride (TG) (β = 0.07, P = 0.32), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (β = 0.008, P = 0.65) and fasting blood sugar (FBS) (β = -0.001, P = 0.94).

Individuals in the highest category of nuts and legume consumption did not had elevated odds for metabolic syndrome after adjusting for potential confounders (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.08-9.80, P = 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Nuts and legumes consumption was not associated with metabolic syndrome or its components. Prospective studies are needed to investigate further this association.",

      "abstract": "Background: The modification of the gut microbiome has been proposed to alter immune response which is a key driver in low-grade inflammation as well as metabolic markers. This study was conducted to determine the effects of a low-calorie diet with and without nuts on some gut bacterial abundance, metabolic markers, and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in stable coronary artery disease patients with overweight or obesity. Methods: Overweight or obese patients with stable coronary artery disease of both genders were randomly allocated to a nut-free calorie-restricted diet as 25% of energy deficit (CRD) or a CRD enriched with 39-60 g/d of mixed nuts (CRDEN) for 8 weeks (32 patients in CRD and 35 patients in CRDEN). Mixed nuts consisted of equal amounts of unsalted pistachios, almonds, and peanuts. Microbiota analysis was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method on feces collected before and after the intervention, using primers targeting 16S ribosomal DNA of 4 different bacterial genera, including Bacteroides, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus. We examined the plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, adiponectin as well as expression of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) in PBMCs. Results: A significant reduction in expression of CX3CR1 (p=0.04) and a tendency to lower expression of TLR4 in PBMCs (p=0.06) was observed in the CRDEN group at the end of the study compared to the CRD group. The abundance of fecal Prevotella also tended to increase in CRDEN compared to the CRD group (p=0.06). Plasma insulin and adiponectin had no significant changes. There was a positive correlation between fecal Prevotella abundance and plasma adiponectin at baseline (r=0.315, p=0.015) and the end of the study (r=0.380, p=0.003). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the inclusion of mixed tree nuts and peanuts in a low-calorie diet for 8 weeks led to a lower CX3CR expression in PBMCs in a cohort of overweight or obese patients with stable CAD. This finding provides another beneficial effect of diet supplemented with nuts on factors associated with inflammation.

      "abstract": "The water extraction of phenolic compounds from two varieties (\"Mahan\" and \"Marameck\") of pecan nutshells (Carya illinoinensis) without and with sonication, varying the solvent/solid ratio (S), the pH, and the refluxing time (t), was studied. Additionally, the in vitro cytotoxicity and the determination of the cell death mechanism of the extracts against the colon cancer cell line HT-29 were investigated. The content of total phenolic compounds (TPC) of \"Marameck\" nutshells resulted higher than for the \"Mahan\" variety, and the pH increase resulted in higher TPC contents for both cultivars. The optimized conditions for TPC extraction without and with sonication resulted: S = 33 ml/g, pH = 12, and t = 9.6 min, and yielded ≈ 70 and 90 mg/g of TPC for \"Mahan\" and \"Marameck\" nutshells, respectively. The optimized extracts of pecan nutshells without sonication from both cultivars presented similar cytotoxicity against HT-29 colon cancer cells (IC50  ≈ 50 µg/ml), higher than for sonicated extracts (IC50 ≈ 88 and 138 µg/ml for \"Mahan\" and \"Marameck,\" respectively). Cell death through apoptosis was the main mechanism of cell death induced by the nutshell extracts. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The extraction of phenolic compounds (TPC) from the residues of two varieties of pecan nutshells (\"Mahan\" and \"Marameck\") was studied. An optimal combination of variables within the pH range that minimizes the solvent-to-solid ratio (S) and the time of refluxing (t), saving at the same time, water and energy, was set up. The phenolic compound extracts obtained from the residues of the pecan nuts exhibit cytotoxic effects against colon cancer cells and could be of interest as an alternative treatment of different types of cancer. Additionally, these extracts may be of importance to the food industry as they can be used as antioxidant agents in food formulation. Also, the high levels of anthocyanidins obtained from the pecan nut extracts after proanthocyanidins' strong acid hydrolysis can be purified and employed as natural red dyes.",

      "abstract": "This project was undertaken to determine the kinetic parameters of thermal inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes on pecans, macadamia nuts, and sunflower seeds subjected to heat treatments simulating industry processes. Five strains were grown in nonselective medium, mixed, and resuspended before inoculating macadamia nuts, pecans, and sunflower seeds (6 to 9 Log CFU/g). Redried inoculated pecans and macadamia nuts were heated in an oven at a temperature range of 90 to 140°C. Unshelled sunflower seeds were heated in sunflower seed oil. The thermal inactivation was determined by measuring viable cell counts using standard microbiological methods. Average count data were fit to the log-linear model, and thermal-death kinetics were calculated. On pecans, the viable Listeria counts were reduced by 3 and 3.5 Log CFU/g after 40 min at 110°C and 8 min at 140°C, respectively. On macadamia nuts, the L. monocytogenes population was reduced by 5 Log CFU/g after 20 min at 120°C. Unshelled sunflower seeds were subjected to heat treatment via a hot-oil bath. On sunflower seeds, >7 Log CFU/g reductions were observed after 15 min at 120°C. The thermal resistance (D value) for inactivation on pecans at 140°C was 3.1 min and on macadamia nuts at 120°C was 4.4 min. The inactivation of L. monocytogenes was influenced by the kind of nut or seed. These results suggest that L. monocytogenes has a relatively high thermal tolerance. The findings from this study will contribute to the assessment of the effectiveness of heat treatment for control of this pathogen on nuts and seeds. IMPORTANCE Listeria monocytogenes is a major concern for the food industry in ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. In recent years, large-scale recalls have occurred with contaminated sunflower seeds and macadamia nuts that triggered product withdrawals. These events stress the importance of understanding Listeria's ability to survive heat treatments in these low-water activity foods. Nuts and seeds are subjected to a variety of thermal treatments typically referred as roasting. To date, no listeriosis outbreak has been linked to nuts and seeds, but the recent recognition that this pathogen can be detected in commercial products stresses the need for research on thermal treatments. The characterization of heat inactivation kinetics at temperatures typically used during roasting processes will be very beneficial for validation studies. This manuscript reports inactivation rates of L. monocytogenes strains inoculated onto macadamia nuts, sunflower seeds, and pecan halves subjected to temperatures between 90 and 140°C.",

      "abstract": "Common nuts (tree nuts and peanuts) are energy-dense foods that nature has gifted with a complex matrix of beneficial nutrients and bioactives, including monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, high-quality protein, fiber, non-sodium minerals, tocopherols, phytosterols, and antioxidant phenolics. These nut components synergize to favorably influence metabolic and vascular physiology pathways, ameliorate cardiovascular risk factors and improve cardiovascular prognosis. There is increasing evidence that nuts positively impact myriad other health outcomes as well. Nut consumption is correlated with lower cancer incidence and cancer mortality, and decreased all-cause mortality. Favorable effects on cognitive function and depression have also been reported. Randomized controlled trials consistently show nuts have a cholesterol-lowering effect. Nut consumption also confers modest improvements on glycemic control, blood pressure (BP), endothelial function, and inflammation. Although nuts are energy-dense foods, they do not predispose to obesity, and in fact may even help in weight loss. Tree nuts and peanuts, but not peanut butter, generally produce similar positive effects on outcomes. First level evidence from the PREDIMED trial shows that, in the context of a Mediterranean diet, consumption of 30 g/d of nuts (walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts) significantly lowered the risk of a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular disease) by ≈30% after intervention for 5 y. Impressively, the nut-supplemented diet reduced stroke risk by 45%. As they are rich in salutary bioactive compounds and beneficially impact various health outcomes, nuts can be considered natural pleiotropic nutraceuticals.",

The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effects of the Brazilian Cardioprotective Diet (DIeta CArdioprotetora Brasileira, DICA Br) based on consumption of inexpensive locally accessible foods supplemented or not with mixed nuts on cardiometabolic features in patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: DICA-NUTS study is a national, multicenter, randomized 16-week follow-up clinical trial. Patients over 40 years old with diagnosis of previous MI in the last 2 to 6 months will be recruited (n = 388). A standardized questionnaire will be applied to data collection and blood samples will be obtained. Patients will be allocated in two groups: Group 1: DICA Br supplemented with 30 g/day of mixed nuts (10 g of peanuts, 10 g of cashew, 10 g of Brazil nuts); and Group 2: only DICA Br. The primary outcome will consist of LDL cholesterol means (in mg/dL) after 16 weeks of intervention. Secondary outcomes will consist of other markers of lipid profile, glycemic profile, and anthropometric data. DISCUSSION: It is expected that DICA Br supplemented with mixed nuts have superior beneficial effects on cardiometabolic parameters in patients after a MI, when compared to DICA Br.

Major societal guidelines that have published on the management of CAC are based on consensus of expert opinion, with the current evidence available. As a result of limited studies, there are many clinical scenarios that are yet to be addressed, with expert opinion varying on a number of important clinical issues regarding CAC management. METHODS: In this review, we utilize current societal guidelines to provide a framework for practitioners in managing their patients with CAC. We have also provided three clinical scenarios that implement important principles of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19.

It has been reported that the content of these bioactive compounds is relatively high in Torreya grandis nuts. However, it is not yet known what changes in squalene and β-sitosterol accumulation occur during the special post-ripening process of T. grandis nuts and the effect of the well-known ripening hormone ethylene on the regulatory mechanism of their biosynthetic pathways. Thus, we performed transcriptome and metabolite analyses. The results showed that ethylene not only promoted the post-ripening process but also enhanced the accumulation of squalene by inducing gene expression in the mevalonate pathway. At the same time, ethylene treatment also promoted the accumulation of other sterols but inhibited gene expression in the β-sitosterol biosynthesis pathway. In addition, co-expression and correlation analysis suggested a framework for the transcriptional regulation of squalene and β-sitosterol biosynthesis genes under ethylene treatment.",

A review of the published bibliography concerning the determination of volatiles in nuts has been carried out. The information retrieved has been divided into four main sections. First, a discussion on the main volatiles present in nuts is performed; next, a revision of the methods used to determine the volatiles is presented; and, finally, two sections describing how harvesting conditions, healthy state and the thermal treatment of nuts modifies their volatile profile are added. Analysis of the published bibliography denoted the complexity of volatile determination and the different variables that can modify the compounds present in the volatile fraction of nuts."

BALB/c mice were given ovalbumin (OVA) to establish an allergic asthma model. The results revealed that TA treatment significantly decreased OVA-induced AHR, inflammatory cells infiltration, and the expression of various inflammatory mediators (Th2 and Th1 cytokines, eotaxin, and total IgE). Additionally, TA treatment also attenuated increases in mucins (Muc5ac and Muc5b) expression, mucus production in airway goblet cells, mast cells infiltration, and airway remodeling induced by OVA exposure. Furthermore, OVA-induced NF-κB (nuclear factor- kappa B) activation and cell adhesion molecules expression in the lungs was suppressed by TA treatment. In conclusion, TA effectively attenuated AHR, inflammatory response, and airway remodeling in OVA-challenged asthmatic mice.

This study was conducted to determine plasma lipid and lipoprotein responses to a low-calorie (25% of energy deficit) nuts containing diet (NELCD) compared with a nut-free energy-restricted diet (NFLCD) in stable CAD patients who were overweight or obese (n = 67). METHODS: Plasma lipids and lipoproteins and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) A1 and ABCG1 mRNA expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks. RESULTS: Plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apoA1 increased significantly in the NELCD group at the end of Week 8 compared with those in NFLCD group (in NELCD group, mean change and 95% confidence interval (CI) were 1.17 [-1.31, 3.66] mg/dL, P = 0.012, and 2.55 [-2.10, 7.20] mg/dL, P = 0.011, for HDL cholesterol and apoA1, respectively). In both groups, the concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride reduced significantly at Week 8 compared with those in baseline with no significant difference between the two groups. ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expressions non-significantly decreased in both groups. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that inclusion of nuts as part of a calorie-restricted diet improves the concentrations of HDL cholesterol and apoA-1 in patients with stable, established CHD receiving statins.",

      "abstract": "Pistachio nuts are an important economic tree nut crop which is used directly or processed for many food-related activities. They can become colonized by mycotoxigenic spoilage fungi, especially Aspergillus flavus, mainly resulting in contamination with aflatoxins (AFs), especially aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). The prevailing climate in which these crops are grown changes as temperature and atmospheric CO2 levels increase, and episodes of extreme wet/dry cycles occur due to human industrial activity. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of interacting Climate Change (CC)-related abiotic factors of temperature (35 vs. 37 °C), CO2 (400 vs. 1000 ppm), and water stress (0.98-0.93 water activity, aw) on (a) growth (b) aflD and aflR biosynthetic gene expression and (c) AFB1 production by two strains A. flavus (AB3, AB10) in vitro on milled pistachio-based media and when colonizing layers of shelled raw pistachio nuts. The A. flavus strains were resilient in terms of growth on pistachio-based media and the colonisation of pistachio nuts with no significant difference when exposed to the interacting three-way climate-related abiotic factors. However, in vitro studies showed that AFB1 production was significantly stimulated (p < 0.05), especially when exposed to 1000 ppm CO2 at 0.98-0.95 aw and 35 °C, and sometimes in the 37 °C treatment group at 0.98 aw. The relative expression of the structural aflD gene involved in AFB1 biosynthesis was decreased or only slightly increased, relative to the control conditions at elevated CO, regardless of the aw level examined. For the regulatory aflR gene expression, there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in 1000 ppm CO2 and 37 °C for both strains, especially at 0.95 aw. The in situ colonization of pistachio nuts resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) stimulation of AFB1 production at 35 °C and 1000 ppm CO2 for both strains, especially at 0.98 aw. At 37 °C, AFB1 production was either decreased, in strain AB3, or remained similar, as in strain AB10, when exposed to 1000 ppm CO2. This suggests that CC factors may have a differential effect, depending on the interacting conditions of temperature, exposure to CO2 and the level of water stress on AFB1 production.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by cells, which can transport different molecules, including nucleic acids. Dietary habits may induce gene regulation through the modulation of exosomal RNAs. We aimed at characterizing exosomal lncRNAs, mRNA and miRNAs modulation after a 1-year adherence to a low-fat diet (LFD) or to Mediterranean-based diets enriched in extra-virgin olive oil (MedDiet + EVOO) or in a mixture of nuts (MedDiet + Nuts). METHODS: Plasma samples were collected, at baseline and after 1 year of dietary interventions, from 150 participants included in the PREDIMED study (Reus Center). LncRNAs, mRNAs and miRNAs were isolated from plasma exosomes and screened. RT-qPCR validation was performed for miRNAs. RESULTS: Compared with LFD, 413 lncRNAs and 188 mRNAs, and 476 lncRNAs and 235 mRNAs were differentially modulated in response to the MedDiet + EVOO and MedDiet + Nuts interventions, respectively. In addition, after 1 year of dietary interventions, 26 circulating miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed between groups. After 1 year of intervention, 11 miRNAs significantly changed in LFD group, while 8 and 21 were modulated in response to the MedDiet enriched with EVOO or nuts, respectively. Bioinformatic analyses of differentially expressed miRNAs and their validated target genes suggest certain metabolic pathways are modulated by LFD (PI3K-Akt and AMPK), MedDiet + EVOO (PI3K-Akt, NF-kappa B, HIF-1, and insulin resistance), and MedDiet-Nuts (FoxO, PI3K-Akt, AMPK, p53 and HIF-1) interventions. CONCLUSION: Results show that 1-year MedDiet + Nuts and MedDiet + EVOO dietary interventions modulate exosomal RNA content, with the former affecting a higher number of miRNAs. The modulation of exosomal RNAs could help explain how the adherence to a Mediterranean diet may lead to beneficial effects and deserves further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Areca nut and Fuzhuan brick tea, a type of natural plant products, have obvious effects of fat reduction and weight loss; however, there is no report on their synergistic effect. This study investigated the effects of Fuzhuan brick tea supplemented with different concentrations of areca nut (5% (LAF), 10% (MAF), and 20% (HAF)) on serum and gut microbiota in Kunming (KM) mice. The results showed that Fuzhuan brick tea supplemented with areca nuts (AFTs) could reduce weight, prevent the accumulation of fat, inhibit the increase in the levels of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood glucose, free fatty acid, insulin, and total bile acid, alleviate the decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and regulate the composition of gut microbiota by high-fat diet intervention. The HAF group with 20% areca nut content showed the best effect. These results could provide a novel approach to prevent obesity and hyperlipidemia. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Consumption of areca nut and tea is widespread in Asia and other regions. As a controversial raw material, the damage due to areca nut to oral mucosa health has often aroused public concern and heated discussion; however, its medicinal value has been confirmed in terms of its pharmacological effects in various aspects. Fuzhuan brick tea, a type of traditional postfermented dark tea, has been confirmed to exert effects of antiobesity. Therefore, the areca nut and Fuzhuan brick tea, as a type of natural plant products, have obvious effects of fat reduction and weight loss; however, their synergistic effect has not been reported. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the effects of the Fuzhuan brick tea supplemented with areca nuts (AFTs) on serum and gut microbiota in mice. On the premise of exerting their beneficial effects (especially in terms of easing food stagnation and eliminating indigestion) and reducing their toxic and side effects, the effects of AFTs on health were further clarified, which could provide a novel direction for the development and utilization of areca nut. Moreover, our research would increase public understanding of areca nut and provide guidance to the Fuzhuan brick tea processing industry.",

      "abstract": "The salt-inducible kinases, SIK1, SIK2 and SIK3, most closely resemble the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and other AMPK-related kinases, and like these family members they require phosphorylation by LKB1 to be catalytically active. However, unlike other AMPK-related kinases they are phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which promotes their binding to 14-3-3 proteins and inactivation. The most well-established substrates of the SIKs are the CREB-regulated transcriptional co-activators (CRTCs), and the Class 2a histone deacetylases (HDAC4/5/7/9). Phosphorylation by SIKs promotes the translocation of CRTCs and Class 2a HDACs to the cytoplasm and their binding to 14-3-3s, preventing them from regulating their nuclear binding partners, the transcription factors CREB and MEF2. This process is reversed by PKA-dependent inactivation of the SIKs leading to dephosphorylation of CRTCs and Class 2a HDACs and their re-entry into the nucleus. Through the reversible regulation of these substrates and others that have not yet been identified, the SIKs regulate many physiological processes ranging from innate immunity, circadian rhythms and bone formation, to skin pigmentation and metabolism. This review summarises current knowledge of the SIKs and the evidence underpinning these findings, and discusses the therapeutic potential of SIK inhibitors for the treatment of disease.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Various studies have reported the use of the 95-degree condylar blade plate in the treatment of a subtrochanteric fracture or non-union. However, the holding power of standard screws in the metaphyseal and diaphyseal area is often diminished due to osteopenia. The alternative in this area is the use of locking plates, Schühlis or AO-nuts. With the latter two, non-locking screws in the blade plate can be converted to a fixed angle fixation. The objective of this study was to compare the stiffness and strength of the AO-nut augmented 95-degree condylar blade plate construct with that of a locking plate construct. In addition, a clinical series of eight patients treated with the AO-nut augmented 95-degree condylar blade plate construct is presented. METHODS: Single screw-plate constructs of a 5.0 mm locking screw/locking compression plate (LCP) and a 4.5 mm non-locking screw/4.5 mm dynamic compression plate (DCP), converted to a fixed-angle screw construct using AO-nuts, were tested by cantilever bending. During loading, force and displacement were recorded, from which the bending stiffness (N/mm) and the yield strength (N) were determined. Secondarily, all patients that underwent surgical treatment for subtrochanteric fracture, malunion or non-union by the senior author using this technique, underwent chart review. RESULTS: The stiffness of the locking screws was about four times higher compared to the AO-nut augmented construct. The yield strength was 2.3 times higher for the locking screw construct. In none of the eight patients treated with the fixed-angle blade plate, failure of the AO-nut augmented construct occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Although the stiffness and strength of the AO-nut augmented construct is less than of the locking screw, excellent clinical outcomes can be achieved utilizing this construct."

The chromatographic analysis revealed that cyanidin-3-O-galactoside represents the main compound (98.37%). The pistachio hull extract efficiently inhibits the mono and diphenolase activity of mushroom tyrosinase (IC50= 141.07 and 116.08 μg/mL, respectively) and it was able, thanks to its strong antioxidant and free-radical scavenging activities, to hinder the L-DOPA auto-oxidation in a concentration-dependent manner (125-500 μg/mL). Results of in vivo assay showed that the treatment with pistachio hull extract (10 μg/mL) reduced pigmentation in zebrafish embryos at early stages of development (60.01% of inhibition vs control). In conclusion, these findings suggest that the ripe pistachio hull may be considered as a promising source of antioxidant and skin whitening agents for the development of new products useful in preventing the pigmentation disorders in humans and/or to improve the food quality.",

They can be colonized by mycotoxigenic fungi, especially Aspergillus flavus, resulting in contamination with aflatoxins (AFs), especially aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a Class 1a carcinogen. The objectives were to examine the effect of interactions between the two key abiotic factors, temperature and water activity (a w ) on (a) in vitro growth and AFB1 production by four strains of A. flavus isolated from pistachio nuts, on a milled pistachio nut medium modified ionically (NaCl) and non-ionically (glycerol) in the range 20-35°C and 0.995-0.85 a w , (b) colonization of layers of raw pistachio nuts stored at different interacting temperature x a w conditions and on relative AFB1 production and (c) develop models to produce contour maps of the optimal and marginal boundary conditions for growth and AFB1 production by up to 4 strains of this species. On pistachio nut-based media, optimum growth of four strains of A. flavus was at 0.98-0.95 a w and 30-35°C. Optimum AFB1 production was at 30-35°C and 0.98 a w . No significant differences in growth was found on ionic and non-ionically modified media. Colonization of layers of raw pistachio nuts was slower and contamination with AFB1 significantly less than in in vitro studies. Contour maps based on the pooled data for up to four strains (in vitro, in situ) showed the optimum and marginal conditions for growth and AFB1 production. These data can be used to identify those conditions which represent a high, intermediate or low risk of colonization and AFB1 contamination in the pistachio nut processing chain. These results are discussed in the context of the development of appropriate intervention strategies to minimize AFB1 contamination of this economically important commodity."

A chemometric model was developed using twenty-eight samples as calibration, 11 as validation and 10 as test set. The discrimination analysis separated correctly the 100% of the calibration and the validation set and the 80% of the test set. The proposed chemometric model is simple, rapid, economical and environmentally friendly since it does not require chemical pre-treatment of the samples. It is expected that the present method may be proved useful in food industry and the inspection authorities as a rapid decision-making tool to detect batches that must be rejected and enhance consumers' protection from aflatoxin contaminated pistachios."

This study aimed to 1) explore the stressful characteristics of pain among individuals living with chronic pain and 2) examine whether the NUTS framework comprehensively captures the stressful nature of pain. SUBJECTS: Participants were 41 adult participants living with chronic pain. METHODS: Interviews in six focus groups were conducted in French using a semistructured interview guide. Participants first discussed how pain is stressful. Then, they were introduced to the NUTS framework and commented on the extent to which it captured their experience. The verbatim transcriptions of interviews were reviewed using reflexive thematic analysis. Analyses were conducted in French; quotes and themes were translated into English by a professional translator. RESULTS: The pain-NUTS framework adequately captured participants' experiences. Multiple aspects of pain (pain intensity fluctuations, pain flare-up duration, pain quality and location, functional limitations, diagnosis and treatment) were associated with one or more stress-inducing characteristics. In addition, a second layer of meaning emerged in the context of chronic pain that provided contextual information regarding when, how, and why pain became more or less stressful. CONCLUSIONS: The NUTS characteristics seem to offer a comprehensive framework to understand how pain and its context of chronicity can be a source of stress. This study provides preliminary support for the pain-NUTS framework to allow the formal integration of pain and stress research.",

      "abstract": "Temperature and relative humidity (RH) influence post-harvest ripening, a crucial stage for quality promotion in some oil plants or fruits. Torreya grandis cv. Merrillii nuts, which are rich in unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), are easily affected by temperature and humidity, and they oxidize quickly during the post-harvest ripening stage, leading to the deterioration of nut quality. In this study, the main nutraceutical components, fatty acid composition, and related metabolic parameters of lipid rancidity under four treatments (20°C and 70% RH, T20-LH; 30°C and 70% RH, T30-LH; 20°C and 90% RH, T20-HH; 30°C and 90% RH, T30-HH) were measured. The post-harvest ripening process was advanced under HH treatments (T20-HH and T30-HH) compared to LH treatments (T20-LH and T30-LH) and was associated with a shorter time for the seed coat to turn dark black and a faster reduction in starch content. The amount of unsaturated fatty acids significantly increased under the T20-HH treatment, but significantly decreased under the T30-HH treatment from 12 to 16 d of ripening time. The acid value (AV) and lipase activity under the T30-HH treatment remained virtually constant from 12 to 16 d of ripening time, and this was accompanied by a dramatic increase in peroxide value (POV), lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, and relative expression of the LOX2 gene. Meanwhile, a significant positive correlation between LOX activity and POV, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and O2⋅- content was observed. The results imply that the lower amount of oxidative rancidity induced by the T20-HH treatment is related to the LOX activity induced by down-regulation of the LOX2 gene during the late after-ripening stage. Therefore, the T20-HH treatment not only promoted the post-harvest process of T. grandis 'Merrillii' nuts but also delayed lipid oxidation, which was ultimately associated with better oil quality at the late after-ripening stage."

INTRODUCTION: There has been an increase in the use of complementary therapy, particularly botanical products, for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been reported that increasing mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids in diet effectively lowers the risk of development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Hence, it was hypothesized that consumption of nuts, which are high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and mono-unsaturated fatty acids, may aid in preventing diabetes and reducing levels of blood glucose by reducing glycemic load by displacing dietary carbohydrates present in diet. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This systematic review included randomized controlled trials that compared the consumption of any type and form of tree nut with a placebo or any other intervention in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Trials were included if they measured fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, and/or glycated hemoglobin. Trials that assessed triglyceride levels and weight postintervention were also considered for inclusion. Trials were restricted to the English language. METHODS: A three step search of PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Trip database, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was done in July 2019. To find unpublished studies, ClinicalTrials.gov and Google Scholar were searched. Studies from the search were reviewed against the inclusion criteria by two reviewers. The JBI critical appraisal checklist for randomized controlled trials was used to assess the potential studies for methodological quality. A meta-analysis and subgroup analysis was conducted among trials with the same type of intervention and outcome measures. Results are presented in a narrative format where statistical pooling was not possible. RESULTS: Fifteen trials were included with a total sample size of 667. Consumption of pistachios demonstrated a significant reduction in triglyceride levels (mmol/L) at three month or earlier follow-up (mean difference [MD] -0.28; confidence interval -0.33, -0.23; P <0.00001). The meta-analysis including all tree nuts combined showed reduction in both fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (MD -0.26 mmol/L and -0.11% respectively) at three month or earlier follow-up. The subgroup analysis demonstrated MD of -0.45, -0.16, and -0.90 mmol/L in fasting blood glucose following ingestion of walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts, respectively, and -0.17% in glycated hemoglobin following ingestion of walnuts at three month or earlier follow-up. Although not clinically significant, these figures give an indication that further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up may show encouraging results. CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that pistachio consumption for three months or less significantly reduced triglyceride levels. Other tree nuts (walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts) reduced fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels by varying degrees. Further robust randomized controlled trials with power calculation-based sample size, comparing same type, dose, and method of nut intervention, will provide more evidence. For now, clinical decisions should be based on standard practice local guidelines. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42019133558.",

      "abstract": "Diet and lifestyle interventions are the recommended treatment for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with the aim of achieving a 7-10% weight loss. Several dietary patterns have been suggested for this purpose, however, to date, the best one is represented by the Mediterranean diet (MD) as it is rich in macro- and micro- nutrients known for their effectiveness in health-promotion and cardio-vascular disease prevention. Moreover, MD is characterized by the inclusion of nuts. These foods have shown potential benefits in health-promotion as they are rich in fibers, which have lipid-lowering effects, rich in mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, which help reduce insulin-resistance and serum cholesterol, and contain anti-oxidants which reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. Additionally, nuts are associated with a better control, or reduction, of Body Mass Index (BMI). All these effects are useful targets to achieve in NAFLD, so that nuts have been proposed as a suitable dietary treatment supplement for weight and metabolic control in these patients. In recent years, health authorities raised an alert on nuts consumption as these may be at high risk of aflatoxin (AF) contamination, for which controls and legislations are different among countries. AF is a well-known cancerogenic agent and a recognized risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with NAFLD have an overall, inherent sevenfold increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma as compared with the general population. In this context, one could argue that recommending the inclusion of nuts in the diet of NAFLD patients has to be balanced with the risk of potential chronic exposure to AF, and every effort should be pursued to assure the safety of these nutrients. In this review, we aim to summarize the benefits of nuts consumption, the evidence for AF contamination of nuts and the consequent potential risks in patients with NAFLD.",

The experimental results were achieved upon performing irradiation of sample pistachio nuts by the aforementioned three devices. Finally, after data analysis based on two factors of toxin inactivation amount and cost feasibility for large scale industrial applications, the AP-CCP device was found to be as an optimum device with an acceptable 4 Logs fungi reduction. However, on the basis of single factor, i.e. toxin reduction rate, the DC-DP device works better with a highest fungi reduction rate of 5 Logs, using Argon in 1 Torr vacuum pressure, 300 W and 20 min irradiation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the most common co-morbidities, that often leads to death, associated with acute pancreatitis (AP) is represented by acute lung injury (ALI). While many aspects of AP-induced lung inflammation have been investigated, the involvement of specific pathways, such as those centered on nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) and pyrin domain containing receptor 3 (NLRP3), has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: To investigate the effect of cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) nuts on pancreatic and lung injury induced by cerulein injection, cerulein (50 μg/kg) was administered to CD1 mice for 10 h. Oral treatment with cashew nuts at a dose of 100 mg/kg was given 30 min and 2 h after the first cerulein injection. One hour after the final cerulein injection, mice were euthanized and blood, lung and pancreatic tissue samples were collected. RESULTS: Cashew nuts were able to (1) reduce histological damage; (2) mitigate the induction of mast cell degranulation as well as the activity of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde; (3) decrease the activity levels of amylase and lipase as well as the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines; and (4) enhance the activation of the Nrf2 pathway and suppress the activation of the NLRP3 pathway in response to cerulein in both pancreas and lung. CONCLUSIONS: Cashew nuts could have a beneficial effect not only on pancreatitis but also on lung injury induced by cerulein."

This study is novel in its exploration of the detail of SUACs' involvement and in its reach across a whole university department of health and social care disciplines. OBJECTIVE: To examine the detail of ways in which SUACs were actually involved in student selection and whether they have any real influence on recruitment decisions. METHOD: This co-produced study took place in an English university. A qualitative, semi-structured interviewing approach was undertaken with 12 staff across social work, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, paramedicine and physician associate disciplines. Thematic analysis was employed independently with both researchers agreeing resultant themes. FINDINGS: A range of recruitment activities which included SUACs were found, evidencing both full and partial involvement in decision making. Nine themes emerged-The quality of SUACs' inclusion; Understanding reasons for including SUACs; SUACs being more knowledgeable than academic staff; SUACs influencing final decisions; The high expectations of candidates by SUACs; SUACs' need for training; Marketization and scepticism; and Logistics and the presumption of ableism. CONCLUSIONS: Transparent protocols are essential if SUACs are to be equitably included in student recruitment processes. A shared model of SUACs' inclusion should be attainable across disciplines, even if the 'nuts and bolts' of recruitment processes vary.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota holds a key-role in numerous biological functions and has emerged as a driving force for the development of diabetes. Diet contributes to gut microbiota diversity and functionality providing a tool for the prevention and management of the disease. The study aimed to investigate the effect of a dietary intervention with pistachio nuts, a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, dietary fibers and phytochemicals on gut microbiota composition in the rat model of Type 1 Diabetes. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four groups: healthy animals which received control diet (CD) or pistachio diet (PD), and diabetic animals which received control diet (DCD) or pistachio diet (DPD) for 4 weeks. Plasma biochemical parameters were determined and histological examination of liver and pancreas was performed at the end of the dietary intervention. Adherent intestinal microbiota populations in jejunum, ileum, caecum and colon were analyzed. Fecal microbiota populations at the beginning and the end of the study were determined by microbiological analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Diabetic animals of both groups exhibited high plasma glucose and low insulin concentrations, as well as characteristic pancreatic lesions. Pistachio supplementation significantly increased lactobacilli and bifidobacteria populations in jejunum, ileum and caecum (p < 0.05) and normalized microbial flora in all examined intestinal regions of diabetic animals. After 4 weeks of supplementation, populations of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were increased in feces of both healthy and diabetic animals, while enterococci levels were decreased (p < 0.05). Next Generation Sequencing of fecal samples revealed increased and decreased counts of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, respectively, in healthy animals that received the pistachio diet. Actinobacteria OTUs were higher in diabetic animals and increased over time in the pistachio treated groups, along with increased abundance of Bifidobacterium. Lactobacillus, Turicibacter and Romboutsia populations were elevated in healthy animals administered the pistachio nuts. Of note, relative abundance of Bacteroides was higher in healthy than in diabetic rats (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dietary pistachio restored normal flora and enhanced the presence of beneficial microbes in the rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes."

      "abstract": "Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), and Listeria monocytogenes have been isolated from low water activity foods (LWAF), where they may survive for extended periods. The ready-to-eat nature of many LWAF, such as dried fruits and nuts, warrants effective post-harvest thermal treatment for the reduction of pathogens such as low-temperature, saturated steam, also known as vacuum-assisted steam pasteurization. The objective of this study was to determine reductions of Salmonella, STEC, L. monocytogenes, and a possible surrogate (Pediococcus acidilactici) on dried apricot halves, whole macadamia nuts, and raisins after treatment with vacuum-assisted steam at three temperatures (62 °C, 72 °C, or 82 °C) and multiple time intervals. Bacterial inactivation was variable between commodities, with higher temperatures and longer times necessary to achieve comparable reductions of pathogens on apricot halves and macadamia nuts compared to raisins. Reductions of the tested pathogens were comparable; therefore, one species was not more resistant than the others. Pathogens were reduced by 5-log CFU/g on apricot halves after 20 min at 72 °C and after 5 min at 82 °C. Longer treatment times were necessary to achieve reductions of each pathogen on macadamia nuts. Pathogens were reduced by nearly 5 log CFU/g on macadamia nuts after 38 min at 72 °C (4.6-6.5 log CFU/g) and after 12 min at 82 °C (4.9-5.7 log CFU/g). Reductions of pathogens on raisins were achieved at lower temperatures than necessary for the other foods. A 5-log reduction for each of the pathogens (CFU/g) on raisins occurred after 20 min at 62 °C and after 5 min at 72 °C. Overall, the reductions of the pathogens exceeded those of P. acidilactici on both the dried fruits and macadamia nuts. Statistically significant differences, indicating greater confidence as a conservative surrogate, were observed at lower treatment temperatures. Inactivation kinetics were modeled for each pathogen on each food type and temperature. Bacterial survival was best described by the Weibull model for raisins and macadamia nuts, while the Gompertz model best described reductions on apricot halves according to Akaike information criterion (AIC) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) evaluations. Water activity and moisture content were increased due to the treatments, which could be addressed through implementation of drying steps. Thermal inactivation kinetic models and 5-log reduction parameters can help food processors design and evaluate similar vacuum-assisted steam interventions to comply with FSMA regulations and preventive control plans. However, results or model predictions should not be extrapolated to assume the safety of other types of foods.",

A number of scientific studies have demonstrated their actions against inflammation, oxidative damage, the aging process, as well as dementia or memory loss. However, only walnuts, followed by almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios, have shown promising results in empirical studies for memory improvements. So, the current review focuses on presenting hypotheses regarding anti-dementia property of nine different nuts: almond, walnut, pistachio, Brazil nut, peanut, pecans, cashew, hazelnut, and chestnut. The nutritious profile of nuts contains essential fats (mostly mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids), proteins (source for arginine, lysine and tryptophan), vitamins (riboflavin, folate, and various tocopherols), fibers, minerals (calcium, sodium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium) and trace elements (copper, zinc, and selenium). Interestingly, the constituents of natural products, nuts being an excellent example, work synergistically and/or in a side-effect neutralizing manner. These latter properties can make nuts an alternate therapy for humankind to fight against memory loss.",

      "abstract": "Two decontamination methods were evaluated for inactivating a cocktail of Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes inoculated onto model low moisture foods (LMFs; dried strawberry, dried apple, raisins, chocolate crumb, cornflakes, shell-on or deshelled pistachio nuts). One treatment was based on a peracetic acid-ethanol (PAA-ethanol) sanitizer combination with the other being an Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) that simultaneously applied UV-C (254 nm), ozone and hydrogen peroxide. The low moisture food was spray inoculated then dried prior to treatment. With Salmonella it was found that a pre-incubation step in 1% w/v glycerol-tryptic soy broth for 1 h prior to plating, significantly increased recovery of the pathogen compared to TSB alone. However, no increased recovery of L. monocytogenes was observed using the TSB-glycerol pre-incubation step. No Salmonella was detected on cornflakes, chocolate crumb and strawberry using 1.25 parts per thousand (‰) PAA-ethanol. The inactivation of Salmonella on deshelled pistachio was significantly higher using 2.5‰ PAA-ethanol sanitizer compared to the AOP treatments tested. Only negligible reductions of Salmonella (<1 log cfu) were obtained with shell-on pistachio treated with PAA-ethanol sanitizer or AOP. Salmonella could be reduced on dried apple slices by >4 log CFU when 5.0‰ PAA-ethanol was applied. L. monocytogenes was more sensitive to PAA-ethanol compared to Salmonella and could be eliminated on all the LMFs apart from shell-on pistachio. An AOP treatment applied 10% v/v hydrogen peroxide, ozone and 54 mJ/cm2 UV-C could significantly reduce Salmonella on dried apple slices compared to when the individual elements (hydrogen peroxide, ozone or UV-C) were applied. Salmonella was also eliminated by AOP on the other LMFs (apart from shell-on pistachio) although the same level of inactivation was achieved by spraying with 10% v/v hydrogen peroxide alone. L. monocytogenes was sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and AOP being eliminated from all the LMFs. Although this may suggest that hydrogen peroxide spray was equivalent to AOP treatment it was noted that no residual H2O2 or changes in visual appearance was evident on samples treated with the latter process. The study has demonstrated that the two decontamination methods assessed can be applied to reduce Salmonella and L. monocytogenes on LMFs although efficacy is dependent on the pathogen and product type.",

In Europe, legislation is in force and 12 μg/kg of AFB1 is the maximum limit set for pistachios to be subjected to physical treatment before human consumption. The goal of the current study was to develop a mechanistic, weather-driven model to predict Aspergillus flavus growth and the AFB1 contamination of pistachios on a daily basis from nut setting until harvest. The planned steps were to: (i) build a phenology model to predict the pistachio growth stages, (ii) develop a prototype model named AFLA-pistachio (model transfer from AFLA-maize), (iii) collect the meteorological and AFB1 contamination data from pistachio orchards, (iv) run the model and elaborate a probability function to estimate the likelihood of overcoming the legal limit, and (v) manage a preliminary validation. The internal validation of AFLA-pistachio indicated that 75% of the predictions were correct. In the external validation with an independent three-year dataset, 95.6% of the samples were correctly predicted. According to the results, AFLA-pistachio seems to be a reliable tool to follow the dynamic of AFB1 contamination risk throughout the pistachio growing season.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of Cola nitida hot infusion against diabetes hepatic injury was investigated in livers of diabetic rats. Cola nitida was infused in boiling water and concentrated. METHODS: The concentrated infusion was administered to T2D rats at low and high doses (150 and 300 mg/kg body weight (bw), respectively). The normal group (positive control) and another diabetic group (negative control) were administered distilled water, while metformin served as the standard drug. A toxic group that consists of normal rats administered a high dose of C. nitida. After 6 weeks, the rats were sacrificed, and their livers were collected. They were assayed for oxidative stress markers, myeloperoxidase, acetylcholinesterase and ATPase activities. Hepatic lipid metabolites were profiled with GC-MS and their metabolic pathways were analyzed using the MetaboAnalyst 4.0 online server. RESULTS: Treatment with C. nitida caused a significant elevation of glutathione level and SOD activity, while concomitantly inhibiting lipid peroxidation, myeloperoxidase, acetylcholinesterase and ATPase activities in hepatic tissues of the rats. Treatment with C. nitida also caused significant depletion of diabetes-generated lipid metabolites, with concomitant generation of fatty esters and steroids as well as inactivation of diabetes-activated pathways. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the therapeutic effect of C. nitida against diabetic hepatotoxicity in diabetic rats.",

      "abstract": "Many epidemiological studies have regularly connected nuts intake with decreased risk for coronary heart disease. The primary mechanism by which nuts protect against cardiovascular disease is through the improvement of lipid and apolipoprotein profile. Therefore, numerous dietary intervention studies investigated the impact of nut consumption on blood lipid levels. Many studies have shown that nut intake can enhance the lipid profile in a dose-response way among individuals with increased serum lipids. This systematic review examines the effectiveness of nuts on the lipid profile among patients with dyslipidemia from different age groups. A total of 29 interventional studies from 5 databases met the inclusion criteria. In all, 20 studies were randomized controlled clinical trials, whereas 9 were crossover-controlled clinical trials. Participants included in the studies were different in terms of age, sex and, serum lipid profile. The studies were inconsistent in the type of tree nuts, duration, dose, and the nut forms. All studies indicated changes in the lipid profile after the intervention particularly on the total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein. Interventional periods ranged from 3 weeks up to 12 months with doses ranged from 15 to 126 gm. In conclusion, this review provides an evidence of favorable effect of nuts consumption of serum lipid profile."
