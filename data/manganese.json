      "abstract": "Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines have great potential in cancer treatment. However, poor lymphatic transport, insufficient targeted delivery, intracellular degradation and insufficient immune response without adjuvants limit the application of mRNA vaccines. Herein, a novel mRNA nanovaccine (HM@Mn3O4-mRNA) was constructed by ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA-loaded Mn3O4 encapsulation with a hybrid membrane (HM) of dendritic cells (DCs) and bacterial membrane for enhancing cancer immunotherapy. In vitro results indicated that HM@Mn3O4-mRNA nanovaccine could target DC2.4 cells, achieve lysosomal escape to enhance the expression of antigen, leading to the efficient antigen presentation and the activation of DC2.4 cells. In vivo results demonstrated that HM@Mn3O4-mRNA nanovaccine could target and retain in lymph nodes (LNs), continuously stimulate antigen presentation, and thus trigger a strong T cell mediated immune response. The prepared nanovaccine could effectively prevent and control the occurrence and development of B16-OVA subcutaneous tumors. This study will provide a new mRNA cancer vaccine delivery platform for cancer immunotherapy."

      "abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma is characterized by malignant proliferation, high aggressiveness, high metastasis, rapid recurrence, and low survival rate; therefore, research on its treatment is vital. In this study, a novel nano system combining sonodynamics and immunotherapy for cutaneous melanoma treatment was designed and developed. Based on the use of phycocyanin for the biomineralization of manganese ions, smart and multifunctional manganese phycocyanin nanoparticles encapsulating the immune adjuvant levamisole (LMS) with melanoma B16-OVA cell membranes wrapped around its outer layer (Mn-PCNP-LMS@CM) were designed and prepared. The experimental results showed that Mn-PCNP-LMS@CM efficiently targeted cutaneous melanomas. Under ultrasonic excitation, it catalyzed oxygen production from hydrogen peroxide in the tumor environment, reduced high glutathione levels in tumor tissues, and significantly enhanced (reactive oxygen species) ROS generation, thus improving the outcome of sonodynamic therapy. In contrast, sonodynamic therapy induced immunogenic death of tumor cells, together with the loaded immune adjuvant levamisole, which promoted the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), modulated the immunosuppressive microenvironment, enhanced the immunotherapeutic effect, and stimulated the function of long-term immune memory to prevent tumor growth and recurrence. This study is expected to provide new ideas for developing novel anti-tumor nano systems and achieving anti-tumor synergistic therapy."

      "abstract": "Activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway could effectively initiate antitumor immunity in triple-negative breast cancer. However, current nuclear DNA-mediated activation of STING pathway remains constrained by the tight protection of nuclear membrane and histones, highlighting the need for new strategies to enhance its efficacy. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), in contrast, is more vulnerable to damage. Herein, our nanoplatforms exploited the high glutathione (GSH) environment characteristic of tumors to release abundant Mn2+, which induced mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of endogenous mtDNA. The released mtDNA, in conjunction with Mn2+ itself functioning as a strong cGAS agonist, effectively activated cGAS-STING pathway. Consequently, the cGAS-STING-dependent secretion of type I interferon successively enhanced the maturation of dendritic cells and cross-priming of CD8+ T cells. In a poorly immunogenic 4T1 tumor model, TPP-MMONs efficiently primed systemic antitumor immunity and significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of αPD-L1 therapy, suppressing tumor growth in both localized and metastatic tumor models. These findings provided an innovative and straightforward strategy to enhance TNBC immunogenicity by targeting mitochondrial damage to induce mtDNA-mediated cGAS-STING activation, thereby sensitizing tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The cGAS-STING pathway is a promising target for overcoming immunoresistance in TNBC. However, current nuclear DNA-based activation strategies are limited by the tight protection of nuclear membrane and histones. Herein, we reported novel manganese-rich, mitochondria-targeting nanoplatforms (TPP-MMONs), which can release abundant Mn²⁺ and significantly induce mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the release of mtDNA. As a result, the nanoplatforms can effectively stimulate the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby enhancing immune responses and improving the therapeutic efficacy of αPD-L1 therapy, offering new insights into TNBC treatments."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women and is associated with high mortality. Traditional modalities, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, have achieved certain advancements but continue to combat challenges including harm to healthy tissues, resistance to treatment, and adverse drug reactions. The rapid advancements in nanotechnology recently facilitated the exploration of innovative strategies for breast cancer therapy. Manganese-based nanotherapeutics have attracted great attention because of their unique characteristics such as tunable structures/morphologies, versatility, magnetic/optical properties, strong catalytic activities, excellent biodegradability, and biocompatibility. In this review, we highlighted different types of Mn-based nanotherapeutics to modulate TME, including metal-immunotherapy, alleviating tumor hypoxia, and increasing reactive oxygen species production, and we emphasized its role in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided therapy, photoacoustic imaging, and theranostic-based therapy along with a therapeutic carrier, all of which were discussed in the context of breast cancer. Hopefully, the present review will provide insights into the current landscape and future directions of multifunctional applications of Mn-based nanotherapeutics in the field of breast cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Inadequate sleep in childhood can impact long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes; thus, identifying modifiable risk factors amenable to intervention is a priority. Development of sleep neuroarchitecture begins in utero. Manganese (Mn) is a trace element known to be both an essential element for optimal neurodevelopment and, at insufficient or excess levels, a neurotoxicant. We examined associations between prenatal urinary Mn levels and objectively measured sleep outcomes in children aged 6.7+/-2.0 years and explored sex-specific effects. Sleep was assessed using multi-day actigraphy (n=222) and single-night in-home polysomnography (PSG) (n=102). Linear and non-linear associations between prenatal log-transformed Mn levels and sleep outcomes were examined using multivariable linear regression and generalized additive models, respectively. Non-linear associations were examined based on low, moderate (referent group) and high Mn levels indexed by tertiles. Sex-specific effects were evaluated using 2-way interaction terms. A doubling increase in Mn was associated with a 30.9 minute (95% CI = -52.0, -9.86) decrease of average sleep period duration and a 21.9 minute (95% CI = -39.9, -4.02) decrease of average sleep duration on actigraphy; associations were more pronounced in males. Compared to children born to mothers with moderate prenatal urinary Mn levels, children whose mothers had \"low\" Mn had a percent increase in minutes of wake after sleep onset (WASO) (β= 89.6; 95% CI = 16.2, 206.5) and a decrease in sleep efficiency percentage (β= -6.47; 95% CI = -11.3, -1.68) on PSG. Sleep problems may be influenced by environmental exposures, such as metals, and disruption can occur as early as pregnancy."

      "abstract": "Tumor immunotherapy represents one of the most promising strategies for combating tumors by activating the immune system, harnessing anti-tumor immune cells to eliminate tumor cells, and preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. However, clinical data indicate that the anti-tumor immune response is often inadequate in many cancer patients, resulting in the failure of tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we report a manganese (Mn)-based nanoadjuvant (denoted as BMP-Au) aimed at synergistically enhancing anti-tumor immune responses in breast cancer therapy through disulfidptosis-induced immunogenic cell death and Mn-mediated cGAS-STING pathway activation. BMP-Au is synthesized using bovine serum albumin as a biotemplate for biomimetic mineralization of manganese phosphate nanosheets, followed by the deposition of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) on their surface. By exploiting the glucose oxidase-like activity of Au NPs alongside the Fenton-like reaction facilitated by Mn2+, BMP-Au orchestrates a cascade catalytic reaction that generates reactive oxygen species from glucose. This process not only initiates disulfidptosis but also leads to DNA fragmentation crucial for activating the cGAS-STING pathway. These concurrent mechanisms compromise cancer cell viability while significantly enhancing tumor immunogenicity, positioning BMP-Au as an innovative nanoadjuvant for cancer treatment that leverages both cellular stress mechanisms and immune activation."

In 10-30% of stroke patients following thrombolysis, the hemorrhagic transformation, associated with iron release, occurs. This study aimed to examine the neurologic outcome following the BMX-001 treatment in a mouse intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) model with relevance to prospective ischemic stroke clinical trials. Methods: Twenty C57Bl6 mice were randomly assigned to groups after surgery and received vehicle or BMX-001 treatment immediately following stereotaxic left striatum collagenase injection. Post-ICH body weight, the Corner test, neurological deficit score, and Rotarod test were examined. Six sham surgery mice serve as a control group. At 72 h, the brain histological evaluation was performed, including hemorrhage size, Prussian blue staining, and the activation of macrophages. Data were collected by a researcher who was blind to groups. Results: No significant difference in body weight, neurological deficits, and hemorrhage size was found between groups. However, BMX-001 reduced the number of macrophages in the hemorrhagic area (48 ± 10 in vehicle, 33 ± 8 in BMX-001, p = 0.008) and the number of cells stained with Prussian blue-an indicator of iron released during hemorrhage (65 ± 22 in vehicle and 41 ± 15 in BMX-001, p = 0.027). Conclusions: The results support the safe use of BMX-001 in stroke patients in combination with thrombolysis or thrombectomy and, moreover, indicate the beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of BMX-001, alike to that previously reported in stroke studies of analogous, similarly redox-active, Mn porphyrins."

      "abstract": "Combination cancer therapy can boost the overall treatment efficacy using functional nanomaterials that specifically target cancer cells. Furthermore, the treatment outcome can be improved by focusing on specific characteristics in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, tumor-targeting multifunctional nanoparticles were constructed from reduced graphene oxide quantum dots (rGOQD), manganese dioxide (MnO2), glucose oxidase (GOx), and cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). The rGOQD/MnO2/GOx/CPP nanoparticles can treat tumors by strengthening chemodynamic/photothermal therapy (CDT/PTT) with starvation therapy (ST). The MnO2 reacts with high concentrations of endogenous H2O2 in an acidic TME to produce reactive oxygen species (ROSs) from Mn2+. The highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radical (•OH) kills cancer cells and initiates CDT. The MnO2 can also consume the •OH scavenger glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells and eliminate their antioxidant defense. The GOx oxidizes glucose to cause cancer cell glucose starvation for ST, which produces H2O2 to boost the efficacy of CDT. By consuming glucose, ST mediated by GOx leads to reduced ATP production in the glycolysis pathway. This downregulates the expression of ATP-dependent heat shock proteins that provide cancer cell thermal resistance when the photothermal agent rGOQD is irradiated with near-infrared (NIR) light for PTT. Therefore, we prepare different rGOQD-based nanoparticles and characterize their physicochemical and biological properties. The nanoparticles were studied in vitro against U87 glioblastoma cells for targeted cancer therapy. Using nude mice bearing subcutaneous U87 tumors, the in vivo study indicates rGOQD/MnO2/GOx/CPP plus NIR irradiation can substantially inhibit the tumor growth rate without causing adverse effects from CPP-mediated trimodal ST/CDT/PTT."

      "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element and a cofactor for several key enzymes, such as mitochondrial superoxide dismutase. Consequently, it plays an important defense role against reactive oxygen species. Despite this, Mn chronic overexposure can result in a neurological disorder referred to as manganism, which shares some similarities with Parkinson's disease. Mn levels seem regulated by many transporters responsible for its uptake and efflux. These transporters play an established role in many inherited disorders of Mn metabolism and neurotoxicity. Some inherited Mn metabolism disorders, caused by mutations of SLC30A10 and SLC39A14, assume crucial importance since earlier treatment results in a better prognosis. Physicians should be familiar with the clinical presentation of these disorders as the underlying cause of dystonia/parkinsonism and look for other accompanying features, such as liver disease and polycythemia, which are typically associated with SLC30A10 mutations. This review aims to highlight the currently known Mn transporters, Mn-related neurotoxicity, and its consequences, and it provides an overview of inherited and acquired disorders of Mn metabolism. Currently available treatments are also discussed, focusing on the most frequently encountered presentations."

      "abstract": "Numerous epidemiological studies indicate that populations exposed to environmental toxicants such as heavy metals have a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to those unexposed, indicating a potential association between heavy metals exposure and AD. The aim of this review is to summarize contemporary mechanistic research exploring the associations of four important metals, arsenic (As), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd), with AD and possible pathways, processes, and molecular mechanisms on the basis of data from the most recent mechanistic studies. Primary research publications published during the last decade were identified via a search of the PubMed Database. A thorough literature search and final screening yielded 45 original research articles for this review. Of the 45 research articles, 6 pertain to As, 9 to Mn, 21 to Pb, and 9 to Cd exposures and AD pathobiology. Environmental exposure to these heavy metals induces a wide range of pathological processes that intersect with well-known mechanisms leading to AD, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, autophagy dysfunction, and tau hyperphosphorylation. While exposure to single metals shares some affected pathways, certain effects are unique to specific metals. For instance, Pb disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and mitochondrial functions and alters AD-related genes epigenetically. Cd triggers neuronal senescence via p53/p21/Rb. As disrupts nitric oxide (NO) signaling, cortical, and synaptic function. Mn causes glutamate excitotoxicity and dopamine neuron damage. Our review provides a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms showing how metals contribute to AD. Information regarding the potential metal-induced toxicity relevant to AD may help us develop effective therapeutic AD intervention, treatment, and prevention."

A full characterization of a designed product includes the evaluation of its impact on specific biological systems, including the study of cell behavior as a response to that particular interaction. Copper and copper-based nanoparticles (CuO NPs) have emerged as valuable building blocks for various biomedical applications such as antibacterial and disinfecting agents for infectious diseases, and the evaluation of the metabolism of food, including the iron required for proteins and enzymes or as drug delivery systems in cancer therapy. In this study, the biological impact of manganese-doped crystalline copper oxide (CuO:Mn) nano-platelets on human normal BJ fibroblasts and human A375 skin melanoma was assessed. The particles were synthesized at room temperature via the hydrothermal method. A complete physicochemical characterization of the materials was performed by employing various techniques including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. Morphological investigations revealed a flat structure with nearly straight edges, with sizes spanning in the nanometer range. XRD analysis confirmed the formation of the CuO phase with good crystallinity, while XPS provided insights into the Mn doping. The findings indicate that nano-platelets interact with cells actively by mediating essential molecular processes. The exogenous manganese triggers increased MnSOD production in mitochondria, compensating ROS produced by external stress factors (Cu2+ ions), and mimics the endogenous SODs production, which compensates internal ROS production as it normally results from cell biochemistry. The effect is differentiated in normal cells compared to malignant cells and deserves investigation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite therapeutic benefits of anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), low response rates and resistance limit its efficacy. Both manganese (Mn) and bisphosphonates (BPs) are known to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). Strategies to synergistically enhance ICD induction and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully explored. METHODS: We analyzed the mode of apoptosis and immunogenicity of cancer cells post-treatment using Western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. RNA sequencing was employed to identify activated apoptotic pathways and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ICD when Mn²+ and BPs act synergistically. In 4T1 tumor models, we evaluated the synergistic anti-tumor effect of Mn²+ and BPs with anti-PD-L1 antibodies. RESULTS: By leveraging the doping capacity of hydroxyapatite (HA) for Mn²+ and its high affinity for BPs, we developed MnHARis particles-a biocompatible slow-release system of biomineralized Mn²+ and risedronate (Ris). Compared to Mn2+ and Ris alone, MnHARis achieved a synergistic antitumor effect, manifesting as increased cytotoxicity (IC50 reduced by 17 times) and the emergence of more significant mitochondrial autophagic apoptosis (more pronounced nuclear fragmentation, increased ROS levels, significantly decreased ATP levels, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulation of autophagy markers (LC3B and Beclin), and obvious autophagosomes). MnHARis exerts its antitumor effects via the p38-MAPK pathway. Additionally, increased exposure of calreticulin and increased secretion of high mobility group box 1 indicated that MnHARis successfully induced ICD and promoted specific recognition and cross-presentation of damage-associated molecular patterns released by apoptotic tumor cells by activating dendritic cells and pattern recognition receptors, thereby altering TME of TNBC, increasing TILs, and sensitizing TNBC to anti-PD-L1 therapy. CONCLUSION: MnHARis effectively synergizes Mn²+ and Ris to promote autophagic apoptosis and ICD, increasing TILs and sensitizing TNBC to anti-PD-L1 therapy, thus offering a new therapeutic strategy.",

      "abstract": "The development of highly efficient antioxidant nanomaterials is crucial for protecting stem cells from oxidative stress, a major challenge in advancing stem cell therapy and tissue regeneration. While most existing materials focus on scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), the often-overlooked contribution of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) further amplifies oxidative damage, limiting therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report a manganese-doped bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF), Dex@(Mn, Zn)EZIF-8, with a hollow architecture designed for precise ROS/RNS scavenging and osteogenic regulation. This MOF is synthesized via a one-pot method, followed by tannic acid-assisted etching and Dex loading. The incorporation of Mn, a transition metal with tunable valence states, significantly enhances catalase-like activity for ROS degradation, while tannic acid etching introduces additional sites for RNS neutralization. By mitigating oxidative stress, Dex@(Mn, Zn)EZIF-8 preserves the viability and essential functions of bone mesenchymal stem cells, including adhesion, proliferation, and migration, while also promoting osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, the sustained release of Dex amplifies osteogenesis, as evidenced by the upregulated expression of key markers such as alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, and osteocalcin. This multifunctional biocatalyst effectively integrates precision oxidative stress regulation with osteogenic promotion, offering a powerful strategy for stem cell protection and regenerative medicine, particularly in oxidative microenvironments."

      "abstract": "Among the multitude of toxic water pollutants, Pb2+ poses a significant threat to human health. A novel magnetic manganese-based metal-organic framework (Mn-MOF) composite, MFCys, was designed for the selective removal of Pb2+. MFCys was readily synthesized through the postsynthetic modification of magnetic Mn-MOF/Fe3O4 (MF) with l-cysteine (l-Cys), utilizing a prospective Mn-MOF, {[Mn2(tzpa)(OH)(H2O)2]·DMA}n. MFCys demonstrated superior adsorption of Pb2+, reaching equilibrium within 2 h compared to Mn-MOF and MF. The Langmuir model indicated that MFCys underwent chemisorption of Pb2+. Meanwhile, the adsorption process aligned with the pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic model, confirming that Pb2+ was adsorbed by MFCys mainly through monolayer chemisorption. Thermodynamic results revealed that the adsorption of Pb2+ by MFCys was spontaneous and endothermic. Moreover, even in the presence of competing Cd2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, and Pb2+, MFCys exhibited exceptional selectivity for Pb2+ due to the electrostatic interaction and the electronic coupling effect between MFCys and Pb2+. The magnetic MFCys enabled easy separation from the suspension within 1 min by using an external magnet for recycling. MFCys retained 98.0% of the initial adsorption capacity for Pb2+ after five cycles, demonstrating excellent reusability. Notably, MFCys displayed exceptional adsorption of Pb2+ in simulated lead-acid battery wastewater, retaining 98.3% of its pristine adsorption capacity for Pb2+ even after five cycles. These findings suggest that an easily separated Mn-MOF composite has promising application prospects in Pb2+ wastewater treatment."

      "abstract": "Lithium manganese oxides (LMO) are highly promising sorbents for lithium extraction from Li+-containing brines with high salt contents due to their high sorption capacity and high selectivity towards lithium. However, conventional synthesis routes are limited in scale. Therefore, herein a novel spray drying method is presented, enabling a scalable synthesis of LMO sorbents for Li+-extraction. The ion exchange material was studied in both synthetic LiCl solutions and two different geothermal brines from the Upper Rhine valley, demonstrating improved Li selectivity and extraction capabilities compared to materials from hydrothermal synthesis approaches. The extraction behavior in relevant mildly acidic environments was studied in detail. Further material improvements were achieved by substituting a fraction of Mn by Ti, which greatly reduced the dissolution of manganese during acid treatment in the first 5 extraction cycles from 5.6% to only 1.8%. In addition, the maximum sorption capacity of the Ti-containing LMO (LMTO) could be further increased from 5.05 mmol g-1 for LMO (35.1 mg g-1 ) to 5.66 mmol g-1 for LMTO (39.3 mg g-1 ) under optimized m/V-ratios. Hence, the results reported herein present a pathway towards LMO-based ion exchange materials for the direct lithium extraction (DLE) on an industrial scale."

      "abstract": "The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene product, pVHL, is frequently deficient in a variety of human cancers. In addressing the treatment of pVHL-deficient tumors, hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) has risen as a promising therapeutic target, culminating in the development of specific inhibitors like PT2385 and its analogues. Nonetheless, the absence of targeted delivery capabilities in these inhibitors heightens the risk of on-target toxicities. To mitigate these limitations, we have engineered a nanoparticle, termed PMMF (PT/MMSN@DSPE-PEG-FA), capable of delivering both a HIF-2α antagonist (PT2385) and manganese directly to tumor sites. PMMF has shown effective targeting of pVHL-deficient clear-cell renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, leading to significant therapeutic benefits and alleviating hypoxic and immunosuppressive traits of the tumor microenvironment. Functionally, PMMF boosts the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes signaling pathway, which, in turn, stimulates a robust innate immune response. This response activates natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes while curbing the infiltration of regulatory T cells. Notably, the therapeutic efficacy of PMMF is markedly reduced when NK cells are blocked but not affected by neutrophil blockade, highlighting the critical role of NK cells in PMMF-induced antitumor immunity. Additionally, the safety profile of PMMF showed minimal systemic post-treatment cytotoxicity. In summary, our findings position PMMF as a promising platform for treating tumors with pVHL deficiency and underscore the therapeutic potential of metalloimmunotherapy."

      "abstract": "Elevated brain levels of the essential metals manganese (Mn), copper, or iron induce motor disease. However, mechanisms of metal-induced motor disease are unclear and treatments are lacking. Elucidating the mechanisms of Mn-induced motor disease is particularly important because occupational and environmental Mn overexposure is a global public health problem. To address this, here we combined unbiased transcriptomics and metabolomics with functional studies in a mouse model of human environmental Mn exposure. Transcriptomics unexpectedly revealed that Mn exposure up-regulated expression of metabolic pathways in the brain and liver. Notably, genes in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, which produces neuroactive metabolites that impact neurological function, were up-regulated by Mn. Subsequent unbiased metabolomics revealed that Mn treatment altered kynurenine pathway metabolites in the brain and liver. Functional experiments then demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of the first and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway fully rescued Mn-induced motor deficits. Finally, elevated Mn directly activates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors, and additional mechanistic assays identified a role for HIF1, but not HIF2, in regulating expression of hepatic kynurenine pathway genes under physiological or Mn exposure conditions, suggesting that Mn-induced HIF1 activation may contribute to the dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway in Mn toxicity. These findings (1) identify the upregulation of the kynurenine pathway by elevated Mn as a fundamental mechanism of Mn-induced motor deficits; (2) provide a pharmacological approach to treat Mn-induced motor disease; and (3) should broadly advance understanding of the general principles underlying neuromotor deficits caused by metal toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major global health challenge, particularly in advanced stages where drug resistance leads to high recurrence rates and poor survival outcomes. This study investigates a novel therapeutic approach combining gambogic acid (GA) with manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (MBG NPs) to enhance anti-tumor efficacy in the acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). The development of MBG NPs involved conjugating MnO2 nanosheets with bovine serum albumin (BSA) for effective GA encapsulation, optimizing the delivery of both components. We explored the potential of Mn2+ ions released from MnO2 to synergize with GA to alleviate tumor hypoxia and modulate the TME, thereby improving immune response. In vitro assays demonstrated significant cytotoxicity of MBG NPs against mouse colon cancer cells (CT26 cells), with enhanced apoptosis and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In vivo studies using BALB/c mice showed that treatment with MBG NPs significantly reduced tumor volumes and improved survival rates compared to controls. Additionally, MBG NPs combined with programmed death-1 inhibitor (aPD-1) further augmented therapeutic effects. Histological analyses confirmed tumor necrosis and changes in TME composition, indicating the potential of this synergistic strategy to overcome drug resistance in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC, inhibit tumor growth and benefit patient survival. These findings highlight the promising application of nanoparticle-based platforms in enhancing immunotherapy outcomes for advanced colorectal cancer."

Recent studies bridge this gap by integrating MRI contrast agents (CAs) with different therapeutic regimes for a better outcome. In this context, manganese-based materials hold great potential owing to their T1/T2 dual-modal MR-relaxation, less toxicity, and other therapeutic capabilities such as chemodynamic therapy, immunotherapy, etc., which have gained increasing interest among researchers and medical professionals. This work offers a timely update on the last three years for Mn-based MRI-guided theranostic applications, including chemodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, photo therapies, sonodynamic therapy, and radiotherapy against cancer. Further, several combinatory therapies and surgical intersections have also been summarized in the light of MRI guidance. The design rationale of these Mn-based agents has been discussed to understand the existing challenges and plausible outcomes shortly. Herein, we deep dive into the stimulus-based probes including pH, temperature, etc. to show the unexplored potential of Mn-complexes in this domain. This state-of-the-art review will guide innovations in Mn-based CAs to expedite safer anticancer theranostic modules for clinical translation.",

      "abstract": "Manganese-oxidizing bacteria (MnOB) and biogenic manganese oxides (BioMnOx) play key roles in the breakdown of organic matter (including pollutants) in water and soil environments. The degradation of some organic compounds (such as sulfonamides selected in this study) by BioMnOx in the presence of active MnOB is poorly understood. Thus far, it has been shown that the transformation of sulfonamides by either BioMnOx or MnOB (but thus far not studied in a binary system) can be modulated using naturally occurring redox mediators, such as humic substances, leading to the formation of coupling products of unknown stability. The co-occurrence of sulfonamides, MnOB, BioMnOx, and humic constituents is pertinent to many natural and engineered settings. This study used syringaldehyde, which is a model humic constituent, to investigate the nature of modulation in a binary system of BioMnOx and MnOB for the first time. The MnOB strain Pseudomonas putida MnB6 was cultivated and used in batch degradation tests. Initial tests with eight sulfonamides showed comparably poor degradation. In the next step of this study, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and two SMX submoieties (sulfanilamide (SNM) and 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole (ISX)) were examined. After 48-60 hours in active cultures with BioMnOx, the degradation of all the three substances was negligible. However, syringaldehyde increased the degradation efficiency by 26% for SMX, 58% for SNM, and 27% for ISX. The active culture and BioMnOx synergistically improved degradation, highlighting the importance of BioMnOx regeneration. Removal was partially reversible (10-30%) owing to the retransformation of the reaction products into parent compounds, which was induced by syringaldehyde depletion. Unstable reaction products were conjugates of SMX, SNM, and ISX with syringaldehyde or its oxidation product DMBQ (2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone). This deconjugation likely contributes to process reversibility, potentially negatively impacting the environment and the safety of water and wastewater treatment systems."

This study aimed to investigate the toxic effects of mixed exposure to manganese, iron, and copper on PC12 cells and its mechanisms, and to evaluate the therapeutic effects of sodium para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS-Na). We employed various experimental techniques, including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT assays), flow cytometry, and western blotting, to systematically analyze cell viability, redox homeostasis, copper ions concentration, and the expression of cuproptosis-related proteins. The results showed that mixed exposure to manganese, iron, and copper significantly reduced the viability of PC12 cells, and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and copper ions concentration. At the same time, Glutathione (GSH) levels significantly decreased, indicating that the cells were affected by oxidative stress. Further analysis revealed that the increased copper ions concentration was closely related to the upregulation of CTR1 protein expression and the downregulation of ATP7 A protein expression, suggesting a link between copper ions accumulation and the ensuing cell death. Notably, PAS-Na treatment significantly restored cell viability and reversed the increase in copper ions concentration and oxidative stress caused by mixed exposure to manganese, iron, and copper. PAS-Na also reversed the expression of cuproptosis-related proteins, indicating its potential for neuroprotection. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of trace metal-induced cell damage and lay the groundwork for the future development of related drugs and therapeutic strategies, warranting further exploration of PAS-Na's clinical efficacy."

      "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) frequently develops resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, resulting from an immune-excluded microenvironment. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can increase tumor immunogenicity and further augment immune-cell infiltration by releasing immunogenic molecules. Hence, inducing ICD within tumors might be a promising strategy to restore antitumor immunity and sensitize HNSCC to ICB. Herein, we developed shikonin (SHK)-loaded, CGKRK-modified lipid nanoparticles (C-SNPs) and demonstrated that C-SNPs could enrich in tumor cells and induce necroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that C-SNPs suppressed tumor-cell mismatch repair, which later activated the cGAS-mediated IFN response and further increased the expression of PD-L1. Combining C-SNPs with an anti-PD-1 antibody increased the infiltration of DCs and CD8+ T cells, yet the response was limited. Modifying C-SNPs with Mn2+ (C-SMNPs) enhanced the activation of cGAS-STING signaling and further boosted the maturation of DCs and the differentiation of cytotoxic T cells within ICB-treated tumors. Importantly, compared to C-SNPs, the combination of C-SMNPs with ICB resulted in more sustained tumor suppression in vivo. Together, we developed a versatile nanoparticle that delivered SHK and Mn2+ which sensitized HNSCC to ICB by disrupting tumor-cell mismatch repair and boosting the cGAS-STING-mediated IFN response. This nanosized ICD inducer-based strategy holds therapeutic potential in synergizing with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy to enhance treatment efficacy in HNSCC.",

However, their clinical translation is hindered by insufficient intracellular availability of essential metal cofactors required for DNAzyme activation. To overcome this limitation, we developed a temperature-controlled synthesis strategy for fabricating multifunctional DNA-templated manganese carbonate nanoparticles (DtMnP). The process involves three critical phases: (i) spherical nucleic acid hybrids, DNAzyme-functionalized AuNPs, serve as scaffolds for spatially controlled Mn2+ deposition through phosphate coordination, initiating heterogeneous nucleation of MnCO3; (ii) rapid liquid nitrogen freezing induces nanoparticle growth along DNA templates; and (iii) lyophilization-mediated structural stabilization enables convenient long-term storage. The DtMnP exhibits pH-responsive dissolution, releasing 90% of Mn2+ within 60 min under tumor microenvironment conditions (pH 5.5). The released Mn2+ ion enables dual functionality: (i) superior magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast of MCF-7 xenograft models with enhanced biosafety, and (ii) synergistic therapeutic efficacy through DNAzyme-mediated EGR-1 gene silencing (60% mRNA downregulation) combined with Mn2+-catalyzed Fenton reactions generating cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (45% apoptosis in MCF-7 cells). The cryo-encapsulated DtMnP exemplifies a flexible and efficient approach for integrating various functional components into a single nanoparticle for tumor theranostic applications."

Acetaminophen, sulphamethoxazole, and losartan were employed as the pharmaceutical targets, evaluating the effects of ROS (reactive oxygen species) in the acetaminophen degradation processes. The methodology of computational calculations was developed to obtain HOMO-LUMO for all systems of modified and unmodified materials in the presence of PMS and acetaminophen to understand both the adsorption and the carbocatalysis processes. This method allows an understanding of the presence of manganese carbonate in thermal synthesis, which determines the modulation of reactive oxygen species depending on the pH of the treatment. This method is significant as follows:•Low-cost carbonaceous materials activated with PMS demonstrated significant efficiency in degrading organic molecules, utilizing singlet oxygen as the primary oxidant.•Theoretical computational approaches investigate the interaction between material and molecule.•The role of carbonate ions in influencing singlet oxygen production in materials derived from residual biomass was examined."

      "abstract": "Nanoparticulate manganese dioxide (MnO2) was integrated into a ferric oxide (Fe2O3) framework via a coprecipitation technique followed by thermal annealing, yielding a porous composite structure enriched with surface pores and microcracks. The Mn:Fe stoichiometry played a critical role in determining the crystalline architecture, catalytic performance, and stability of the composites. In dark conditions, the degradation of Bisphenol A (BPA) through peroxydisulfate (PDS)-mediated electron transfer did not achieve complete mineralization. Under UV irradiation, however, the composite facilitated near-complete BPA mineralization due to a synergistic interaction between radical generation and electron transfer processes. Notably, nonradical mechanisms predominantly governed BPA degradation, with the PDS-MnO2 interaction being central to its efficiency. The Fe2O3 matrix improved structural stability, significantly reducing manganese ion leaching. Specifically, MnFe-12 (Mn:Fe 1:2) exhibited a 2200-fold reduction in Mn dissolution compared to bare MnO2. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that radical-mediated processes elevated the oxidation state of Mn ions, while Fe ions remained unchanged. The study highlights the importance of integrating radical and nonradical pathways to achieve efficient and sustainable degradation of persistent pollutants, offering insights for the rational design of advanced oxidation systems with enhanced structural integrity and catalytic efficiency."

In this study, we synthesized manganese-doped magnetic nanoflowers (Mn-NFs) using a polyol-mediated approach to enhance heating efficiency and biocompatibility for MH applications. Our objective was to evaluate their structural, magnetic, and in vitro hyperthermic properties to determine their potential for lung cancer therapy. Methods: Mn-NFs, with the general formula MnxFe3-xO4 (x = 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7), were synthesized via a one-step polyol method and characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). Their heating efficiency was assessed through specific absorption rate (SAR) measurements in aqueous and solid environments under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). Cytocompatibility was evaluated using the Alamar Blue assay on A549 lung carcinoma cells. Cellular uptake was quantified via a colorimetric iron determination method, while in vitro MH efficacy was tested by subjecting Mn-NF-loaded A549 cells to AMF exposure at different field strengths and nanoparticle concentrations. Results: Mn-NFs exhibited a flower-like morphology with enhanced magnetic properties, achieving high SAR values, particularly in immobilized conditions. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed high biocompatibility at relevant doses, with Mn-NFs of x = 0.3 showing optimal cellular uptake. MH studies demonstrated significant cancer cell death at AMF intensities of around 30 kA/m, with increased effectiveness following static magnetic field pre-alignment. Conclusions: The results highlight Mn-NFs, particularly those with a Mn content of x = 0.3, as promising candidates for MH-based lung cancer therapy, combining high heating efficiency, biocompatibility, and effective intracellular uptake. Further studies are needed to validate their therapeutic potential in vivo."

      "abstract": "A novel composite cementitious material was constructed by synergistically utilizing multiple industrial solid wastes, including electrolytic manganese residue (EMR), red mud (RM), and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), with calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] as an alkaline activator. In addition, the mechanical properties of the composite cementitious materials were systematically analyzed under different raw material ratios, alkali activator dosages, and water-binder ratios. To further investigate the hydration products and mechanisms of the composite cementitious material, characterization methods, for instance, XRD, FT-IR, SEM-EDS, and TG-DTG, were employed to characterize the materials. To ensure that the composite cementitious material does not cause additional environmental pressure, it was analyzed for toxic leaching. The relevant experimental results indicate that the optimal ratio of the EMR-RM-GGBS-Ca(OH)2 components of the composite cementitious material is EMR content of 20%, RM content of 15%, GGBS content of 52%, calcium hydroxide as alkali activator content of 13%, and water-binder ratio of 0.5. Under the optimal ratio, the composite cementitious material at 28 days exhibited a compressive strength of 27.9 MPa, as well as a flexural strength of 7.5 MPa. The hydration products in the as-synthesized composite cementitious material system primarily encompassed ettringite (AFt) and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H), and their tight bonding in the middle and later curing stages was the main source of engineering mechanical strength. The heavy metal concentrations in the 28-day leaching solution of the EMR-RM-GGBS-Ca(OH)2 composite cementitious material fall within the limits prescribed by the drinking water hygiene standard (GB5749-2022), indicating that this composite material exhibits satisfactory safety performance. To sum up, it is elucidated that the novel process involved in this research provide useful references for the pollution-free treatment and resource utilization of solid wastes such as red mud and electrolytic manganese residue in the future."

The steel sheets are shaped into omega profiles using a press tool, followed by the intercritical annealing of the samples to enhance their ductility. Before the experiment, the anticipated values were a tensile strength (UTS) of approximately 1100 MPa and elongation within 30-35%. A key objective was to achieve a microstructure that incorporates residual austenite. The experimental parameters were carefully derived from an extensive exploration to identify potential weaknesses in the experiment. The main parameters selected were the intercritical annealing (IA) temperature and IA dwell time. The results revealed that the highest recorded UTS was 1262 ± 6 MPa, while the maximum elongation achieved was 16 ± 1%."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Advanced gastric cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with limited therapeutic options available. In contrast, immunotherapy have emerged as promising alternatives, offering greater potency in treating advanced gastric cancer. However, the development of novel and efficient immunotherapeutic strategy is crucial to enhance the body's immune response against gastric cancer. METHODS: This study developed a single-injection peptide hydrogel-based nanovaccine therapy for gastric cancer treatment. The therapy utilizes a RADA32 peptide hydrogel, which is sensitive to metal ion concentration, to encapsulate manganese ions and HPPS nanovaccines. The HPPS nanovaccines contain antigen peptide and CpG-ODN, designed to activate both the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and cGAS-STING signaling pathways in antigen-presenting cells. This design aims to facilitate a stable and sustained release of the nanovaccine, thereby enhancing the body's effective recognition and response to antigens. RESULTS: The efficacy of the system was confirmed using the model antigen OVA and the gastric cancer-specific antigen MG7-related peptide. The results demonstrated that the nanovaccine effectively activated the immune response, leading to enhanced recognition and response to the antigens. This activation of both TLR9 and cGAS-STING pathways in antigen-presenting cells was crucial for the observed immune response, highlighting the potential of this approach to stimulate a robust and sustained immune response against gastric cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a novel strategy for clinical anti-tumor vaccine administration, offering a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer. The single-injection peptide hydrogel-based nanovaccine system provides a convenient and effective method to enhance the body's immune response against gastric cancer. This approach could potentially be expanded to other types of cancer, providing a versatile platform for cancer immunotherapy.",

Excessive exposure to manganese not only increases manganese levels in the body, but can also disrupt the homeostasis of other trace elements. Elemental imbalance has been reported as a risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, and restoring elemental homeostasis may be a potential strategy to combat these conditions. We investigated the relationship between trace element dysregulation and cognitive function following different doses of manganese exposure in multiple tissues. Our results indicated that manganese exposure resulted in decreased learning and memory abilities, as well as impaired balance in rats. Manganese imbalance disrupted elemental homeostasis in several tissues. Hippocampal elemental dysregulation was associated with cognitive performance, and changes in aluminum levels in tissues also appeared to be closely related to cognitive function. Curcumin intervention ameliorated manganese-induced behavioural abnormalities and partially reversed manganese-induced elemental dysregulation, demonstrating its potential as a regulator of elemental homeostasis."

Manganese (Mn) is an essential cofactor that plays a critical role in the development and maturation of the crop. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the sweet potato response to Mn remains unclear. RESULTS: In this study, Mn treatment increased the depth of yellow color in sweet potato, augmented sugar and carotenoid accumulation in storage roots, accompanied with a decline in plant hormones. Especially, Mn-treated storage roots displayed more than a 200% increase in β-carotene content compared to the control, while the abscisic acid (ABA) content was reduced by at least 50%. An integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis suggested that Mn application regulated transcriptional and metabolic profiles of carotenoid biosynthesis, soluble sugar, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and biosynthesis of amino acids. Further study revealed that Mn treatment stimulated β-carotene accumulation in storage roots by up-regulation of the transcripts of GGPPS, ZIDS, LCYB and OR, along with down-regulation of CCD1 and CCD4. Moreover, Mn application reduced ABA content through preventing the expression of NCED1. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that Mn, emerging as an agrochemical candidate, will meet agricultural challenges by not only enriching the flesh coloration but also augmenting the nutritional value of sweet potatoes. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

      "abstract": "Chemodynamic therapy (CDT), which utilizes transition metal ions to catalyze Fenton-like reactions for the eradication of tumor cells, has attracted substantial attention in the field of nanocatalysis. However, the therapeutic efficacy of CDT as a monotherapy is often limited by an insufficient level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) within tumor cells. Because of the high copper content in tumor tissues, a copper ionophore was strategically employed to enhance the intracellular accumulation of copper, thereby potentiating the CDT effect. Additionally, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to modify the copper ionophore, naphthazarin (Nap), to promote its targeting efficacy for tumor cells and to ensure its biosafety. The BSA-coated Nap nanoparticles, which could recruit Cu2+ in situ, were further deposited onto the surface of a manganese carbonate nanocube (Nap-BM NPs). The synergistic action of copper and manganese ions accelerated the decomposition of H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and consumed intracellular GSH, leading to cellular mortality via mitochondrial pathways. With low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility in normal cells, the developed Nap-BM NPs significantly enhanced therapeutic outcomes by leveraging multiple Fenton-like reaction mechanisms to augment CDT, offering promising potential for clinical applications and contributing valuable insights into the field.",

Despite the efforts in medical research, current treatment options are unsatisfactory, urging novel therapeutic strategies. Oxidative stress and dysregulated autophagy play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of I/R injury, damaging intestinal tissues and disrupting normal functions. The aim of this study is to fabricate macrophage membrane-coated manganese dioxide nanospheres loaded with rapamycin [Ma@(MnO₂+RAPA)] for alleviating intestinal I/R injury. METHODS: We engineered honeycomb MnO2 nanospheres coated with a macrophage membrane to act as a drug delivery system, encapsulating RAPA. In vitro OGD/R model in IEC-6 cells and in vivo mouse I/R injury models were used. Targeting ability was evaluated through in-vivo imaging system. Effects on cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, oxygen generation, inflammatory factors, apoptosis, autophagy, and biocompatibility were detected by methods such as MTT assay, fluorescence microscopy, ELISA kit, TUNEL assay, Western blotting and histological analysis. RESULTS: In this study, Ma@(MnO₂+RAPA) efficiently deliver RAPA to damaged tissues and exhibited good ROS-responsive release. Our data showed that Ma@(MnO₂+RAPA) reduced ROS, increased O₂, inhibited inflammation, and promoted autophagy while reducing apoptosis in IEC-6 cells. In a mouse I/R model, Ma@(MnO₂+RAPA) significantly reduced Chiu's score, improved tight conjunction proteins, decreased apoptosis, reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. RAPA released from the Ma@(MnO₂+RAPA), enhanced the expression of autophagy-regulated proteins p62, Beclin-1, and LC3II. The biocompatibility and safety of Ma@(MnO₂+RAPA) were confirmed through histological analysis and biochemical detection in mice. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that Ma@(MnO₂+RAPA) alleviated intestinal I/R injury by reducing oxidative stress, promoting autophagy, and inhibiting inflammation.

The existence of therapeutic-refractory cancer stem cells (CSCs) and inadequate activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator (cGAS/STING) signaling pathway greatly contribute to immune evasion and immunotherapeutic resistance. Herein, we sought to develop a nanocomplex for HNSCC therapy by simultaneous CSCs eradication and STING activation. PTC209/MnO2@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoparticles (PMB NPs) synthesized via a facile and green process are reported, wherein the released manganese (Mn) ions under acidic tumor microenvironment significantly enhance cGAS-STING signals and facilitate the dendritic cells maturation to unleash the T-cell-mediated immune response. Meanwhile, PTC209 released from PMB NPs targets BMI1+ CSCs to suppress cancer stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and elicits apoptosis to further potentiate Mn-based metalloimmunotherapy. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments elucidate that PMB NPs function as designed, exerting powerful immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic impacts to impede HNSCC growth and metastasis as well as bolster anti-PD-1-based ICB. Collectively, our findings provide a promising therapeutic strategy against HNSCC by combinational CSCs elimination and STING activation via metalloimmunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Real-time visualization and tracking of epileptic seizures are important for studying epilepsy pathogenesis and treating epilepsy; however, the requisite sensing is extremely challenging, primarily due to the transient and intricate nature of neural activity associated with epilepsy. The onset of epilepsy is closely correlated with increases in peroxynitrite (ONOO-) levels, a reactive nitrogen species that can serve as a biomarker for epilepsy. However, the fleeting biological half-life and high reactivity of ONOO- has historically impeded its direct visualization within the epileptic brain. This study explores the efficacy of manganese(ii) texaphyrin (MMn), a water-soluble and stable expanded porphyrin, in dynamically sensing ONOO- and providing real-time tracking of epileptic seizures using a custom-built photoacoustic imaging (PAI) setup. UV-vis spectral analyses established the preferential sensitivity of MMn to ONOO- over other reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as its effectiveness through multiple usage cycles when rejuvenated via reaction with suitable reducing agents. This selectivity was recapitulated in vitro as determined through PAI experiments. In vivo application of this technique revealed that MMn administered intravenously crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced epilepsy mouse model and provides an observable 14.1 ± 3.7% reduction in photoacoustic (PA) signal intensity within the hippocampal region during epileptic seizures. Multiple decreasing-increasing cycles of PA signal intensity could be detected in the hippocampal region in this model; the observed effect thus mirrors closely the course of epileptic seizures inferred from mouse tail curling. Similar cyclical patterns were also seen in the motor cortex, a finding consistent with the extensive spread of epileptic activity throughout the brain. To the best of our knowledge, the present investigation represents the first real-time visualization and tracking of epileptic seizures using a peroxynitrite-specific sensing probe in combination with photoacoustic imaging (PAI). This approach enables deeper brain imaging while simultaneously capturing dynamic ONOO- fluctuations, offering biochemical insights into epilepsy pathogenesis. By integrating deep-tissue imaging with neurochemical monitoring, this method lays the foundation for potential advances in epilepsy management and treatment."

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke represents a significant global health challenge, frequently associated with intricate pathophysiological alterations. During ischemic stroke, the generation of reactive oxygen species markedly increases, leading to direct neuronal damage as well as initiating a cascade of inflammatory responses. This oxidative stress can also disturb the equilibrium of the gut microbiota, resulting in dysbiosis. In turn, an imbalance in gut microbiota can further exacerbate the production of reactive oxygen species and contribute to a pro-inflammatory environment within the body. This creates a vicious cycle that not only promotes the progression of stroke but also leads to adverse functional outcomes. The neuroinflammation and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis that occur following ischemic stroke are critical contributors to stroke progression and adverse functional outcomes. We previously developed manganese-ferric Prussian blue nanozymes, characterized by a multi-enzyme structure and a porous design, that exhibit strong antioxidant properties. However, the therapeutic effects of manganese-ferric Prussian blue nanozymes on ischemic stroke and their mechanisms of action remain have not been fully elucidated. To investigate this, we constructed a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion and administered manganese-ferric Prussian blue nanozymes via gastric gavage. Our results demonstrated that these nanozymes substantially reduced infarct volume, improved neurological function, restored gut microbiota balance, and increased levels of short-chain fatty acids in the mouse model. Treatment of lipopolysaccharide-treated BV-2 cells with short-chain fatty acids markedly decreased the expression levels of components of the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway, including Toll-like receptor 4, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha, and pp65. These findings suggest that manganese-ferric Prussian blue nanozymes can correct gut microbiota dysbiosis and increase short-chain fatty acid production by modulating the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway, thereby providing therapeutic benefits in the context of ischemic stroke."

      "abstract": "Various methods have been explored to activate potassium permanganate (Mn(VII)) for the elimination of organic compounds, typically by generating highly-reactive manganese species (RMnS) or mediated by electron transfer process (ETP). However, the oxidation selectivity, transformation pathways, toxicity byproduct potential, and efficacy in complicated water matrices associated with RMnS and ETP have not been comprehensively evaluated and compared, which is important for selecting a fit-of-purpose mechanism for water remediation. This study selected Mn(VII)/graphite process and ultraviolet (UV)/Mn(VII) process as the model ETP-dominated system and RMnS-dominated system, respectively. RMnS demonstrated significantly higher degradation efficiency for bromophenols, with oxidation rate constants 2.69-6.28 times higher than ETP. The oxidation efficiency of RMnS could be enhance under alkaline condition, whereas the degradation efficiency of ETP is dependent on the combined effects of solution pH and pKa of compounds. Furthermore, RMnS exhibited a stronger dehalogenation capacity, enabling the almost complete release of bromide ions from bromophenols with the formation of non-brominated organic product. Correspondingly, the RMnS process obviously reduced the brominated disinfection byproducts formation potential (DBPFPs). Mass spectrometry results revealed that the ETP process tended to form more polymeric brominated dimer products during the oxidation of bromophenol, leading to more DBPFPs production. ETP process showed superior degradation efficiency in real water backgrounds due to robustness against complicated water matrices, and displayed lower energy and oxidant consumption. Findings of this study elucidated the efficiency and mechanistic differences between RMnS and ETP, providing guidance for selecting activation methods to enhance KMnO4-based water treatment process."

      "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, remains one of the top killers among infectious diseases. The pathogenesis hallmarks for TB are complex immune escape mechanisms of Mtb and low targeting effects of anti-TB drugs. cGAS signaling, which is responsible for triggering host antibacterial immunity against Mtb infection, has shown potentials to serve as targets for anti-TB immunotherapy. As cGAS agonist manganese ions (Mn2+) can activate cGAS-mediated autophagy to inhibit intracellular Mtb in macrophages, we constructed a functional nanoagonist targeting cGAS signaling based on manganese dioxide nanoparticles, naming Tuf-Rif@HA-MnO2 NPs, for synergistic macrophage-targeted drug delivery and anti-TB immuno-therapeutics. Tuf-Rif@HA-MnO2 NPs can actively target macrophages for rifampicin delivery and react with intracellular glutathione (GSH) to release Mn2+ for cGAS-STING signaling activation, which further promote autophagy and antibacterial M1 polarization of Mtb infected macrophages to achieve synergistic intracellular Mtb clearance. Furthermore, Tuf-Rif@HA-MnO2 NPs can potentiate dendritic cell maturation, CD4+ Th1 cell and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell activation in vivo, which collectively attribute to reduced Mtb burdens and alleviated tissue inflammations in lung of Mtb-infected mice without systemic toxicity. This macrophage targeted drug delivery nanoagonist system is expected to develop rational immunotherapy strategy targeting cGAS signaling against TB and drug-resistant TB. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: cGAS-mediated autophagy plays a critical role in Mtb clearance in macrophages. Tuf-Rif@HA-MnO2 NPs specifically deliver rifampicin into macrophage for Mtb clearance. Tuf-Rif@HA-MnO2 NPs activate cGAS-mediated macrophage autophagy for Mtb clearance. Tuf-Rif@HA-MnO2 NPs synergize cGAS-mediated immunotherapy with targeted drug delivery for more effective anti-TB treatment.",

In this study, using a three-dimensional biofilm electrode reactor (3D-BER) enhanced with iron-manganese oxide catalysts was explored for the treatment of NB wastewater. Modifying polyurethane (PU) sponge fillers with Fe₃O₄ and Mn₃O₄ improved the conductivity and microbial electron transfer of the 3D-BER, significantly enhancing organic compound degradation, nitrogen and phosphorus removal. At the optimal voltage of 6 V and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 h, the reactor achieved CODCr and ammonia nitrogen removal rates of 93.04 % and 86.25 %, respectively, which were more than 20 % higher than those in the control group. The iron and manganese present facilitated increased microbial activity and electron transfer efficiency, and metagenomic sequencing revealed shifts in the microbial communities and the enrichment of specific functional genes related to NB degradation. This integrated bioelectrochemical approach offers an effective and low-cost solution for treating NB wastewater, with broader implications for organic chemical wastewater management.",

      "abstract": "Recent investigations have underscored the significant role of manganese ions (Mn2+) in immunization, particularly through the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which enhances antitumor immune responses. However, the rapid metabolism of free Mn2+ following administration limits its effectiveness as an immune adjuvant. To address these challenges, microneedles (MNs) of hyaluronic acid containing Sparfloxacin (SP) and zinc-manganese sulfide (ZMS) are prepared for the postoperative in situ treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to prevent cancer recurrence and combat wound infection. ZMS/SP (ZS)-loaded MNs exhibit strong antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties that are crucial for preventing postoperative infections. Moreover, the generation of reactive oxygen species by these MNs disrupts the oxidative balance, effectively activating immunogenic cell death and facilitating the release of cytokines. ZS significantly suppressed tumor growth, reduced lung metastasis, and promoted wound healing. These effects are accompanied by notable increases in immune cell infiltration and activation, which is consistent with the gene sequencing results. Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway further improved antitumor immunity. These findings highlight the potential of ZS MNs as an effective and safe treatment that utilizes the immunostimulatory properties of Mn2+ to enhance local and systemic immune responses for the prevention of postoperative TNBC metastasis.",

With continuous advances in diagnostic technology and treatment approaches, the survival rates of some cancers have increased. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of the mechanisms underlying tumors, cancer remains a serious public health issue that threatens the health of the population globally. Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element for the human body. Its regulatory role in tumor biology has received much attention in recent years. Developments in nanotechnology have led to the emergence of Mn-based nanoparticles that have great potential for use in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers. Mn-based nanomaterials can be integrated with conventional techniques, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and gene therapy, to augment their therapeutic effectiveness. Further, Mn-based nanomaterials can play a synergistic role in emerging treatment strategies for tumors, such as immunotherapy, photothermal and photodynamic therapy, electromagnetic hyperthermia, sonodynamic therapy, chemodynamic therapy, and intervention therapy. Moreover, Mn-based nanomaterials can enhance both the precision of tumor diagnostics and the capability for combined diagnosis and treatment. This article examines the roles and associated mechanisms of Mn in the field of physiology and tumor biology, with a focus on the application prospects of Mn-based nanomaterials in tumor diagnosis and treatment."

Three MnOx types: naturally-occurring (NatMnO), commercially-derived (ComMnO), and laboratory synthesised (SynMnO) were examined in batch systems under varying pH, adsorbent dosage, ionic strength, and contact time. The greatest V sorption occurred at acidic pH, following the order: NatMnO > SynMnO > ComMnO, with maximum adsorption capacities of 54.0, 26.0, and 10.4 mg/g, respectively (at pH 3.0, mass/volume ratio of 2 g/L, concentration of 100 mg/L, 24 hours). Adsorption equilibrium data best fit the Freundlich isotherm, indicating multilayer adsorption, while kinetic data followed a two-constant rate model, suggesting both physical and chemical sorption. Solution pH was found to have a significant impact, with V removal by MnOx most effective at low pH, likely due to the negative zeta potential of the MnOx under such conditions. MnOx reusability was investigated using repeated sorption and desorption experiments with 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M NaOH, and deionised water to regenerate the MnOx. The regenerated MnOx exhibited similar or enhanced ability to sorb V ions from solution. Overall, these results confirm the unique ability of MnOx as a reusable sorbent for V removal from acidic water, while also enhancing our mechanistic understanding of the removal process. This finding supports the development of sustainable solutions for acidic water treatment, contributing to efforts to address this critical environmental challenge."

      "abstract": "Notable advancements have been made in utilizing immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) for the treatment of various cancers. However, the overall response rates and therapeutic effectiveness remain unsatisfactory. One cause is the inadequate immune environment characterized by poor T cell infiltration in tumors. To address these limitations, enhancing immune infiltration is crucial for optimizing the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Activating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway is essential for initiating immune response and has become a potential target for developing combination therapies with ICB. In this study, we designed and fabricated manganese-containing nanoparticles loaded with the CHK1 inhibitor PF477736, which were subsequently encapsulated with macrophage membrane (PF/MMSN@MPM). This innovative design achieved excellent tumor targeting and demonstrated potent antitumor effects. The combination therapy dually amplified the cGAS-STING pathway, causing a cascade of enhanced therapeutic effects against tumors. Furthermore, single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis revealed that PF/MMSN@MPM enhanced the activation and infiltration of immune cells. Moreover, the combination of PF/MMSN@MPM with anti-PD-1 (αPD-1) exhibited a stronger therapeutic effect compared to αPD-1 alone. PF/MMSN@MPM precisely and synergistically activated the cGAS-STING pathway, significantly improving therapeutic efficacy of ICB, and offering promising potential for tumor therapy.",

The structural configuration of PVDF+Ze@MP was ascertained by SEM, XRD, and FTIR, whereas the thermal properties were examined using TGA analysis. Electrochemical analysis, based on the Teorell-Meyer-Sievers (TMS) model, revealed that charge density significantly influenced ion transport and separation efficiency. The membrane exhibited high cation selectivity, with the membrane potential increasing as the electrolyte concentration decreased, indicating its ability to selectively transport specific ions. Additionally, performance metrics for mobility ratio, transport number, and membrane potential followed the trend KHCO3 < NaHCO3 < KCl < NaCl except for fixed charge density, which followed the reverse order highlighting the membrane's adaptability for efficient ion separation. The novelty of this work lies in the synergistic integration of PVDF, zeolites, and manganese phosphate to create a composite membrane with enhanced stability and selective ion exchange performance, making it a strong candidate for challenging water treatment applications. With superior electrochemical properties, low fouling behavior, and robust thermal and mechanical stability, this membrane holds strong potential for practical implementation in desalination and ion exchange processes."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is limited by unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy and dose-dependent phototoxicity in clinical settings. Intravenous nano-drug delivery systems (NDDSs) hold promise for enhancing the delivery efficiency of photosensitive drugs, but often result in aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effects, preventing site-specific activation. METHODS: We exploited manganese (Mn2+)-pyrochloric acid (PPa) nanocomplexes coordinated using the photosensitizer PPa and metal Mn ion for the treatment of osteosarcoma. The nanocomplexes were precisely co-assembled in water to stably co-deliver Mn2+ and PPa, enabling tumor-specific release and fluorescence recovery. RESULTS: Following laser irradiation, the activated PPa significantly enhanced the killing effects on primary cancer cells. Additionally, Mn2+ ions activated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, promoting maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and augmenting CD8+-mediated antitumor immune responses. DISCUSSION: This study advances the on-demand activation of photosensitive drugs and photodynamic immunotherapy toward clinical applicability by exploiting Mn2+-PPa nanocomplexes with high activatability and effectiveness for targeted PDT and immunotherapy."

      "abstract": "In Northern Canada, pollution from mining discharges represents a significant environmental stressor for aquatic organisms. Variations in water temperature constitute another source of stress for fish. Although numerous studies have investigated the effects of environmental stressors on fish physiology, research specifically addressing their impact on energy metabolism pathways remains limited. In this study, we investigated the effects of manganese (Mn), thermal acclimation, and their combination on cellular energy metabolism pathways in Arctic charr, a cold-water stenotherm. Juvenile charr were acclimatized to two contrasting temperatures (7 °C and 16 °C) for two weeks. Thereafter, half of the specimens where exposed to Mn (1 mg/L) for eight weeks. After 56 days, mortality was higher in fish acclimatized to 16 °C compared to 7 °C. Trace metal analysis performed by ICP-AES showed that bioaccumulation of Mn in gills and kidney was higher at 7 °C than at 16 °C, while the bioaccumulation of Mn in liver and muscle was not affected by temperature. Enzyme assays performed in liver and muscle showed a decrease in aerobic capacity and an increase in glycolytic capacity caused by Mn combined with a high temperature. Hepatic cytochrome C oxidase activity was significantly lower in fish acclimatized at 16 °C and exposed to Mn compared to other treatments. Hepatic citrate synthase activity showed a decrease in fish from the 16 °C and Mn treatment compared to those at 7 °C without Mn exposure. In both tissues, phosphofructokinase activity increased in fish acclimatized at 16 °C and exposed to Mn compared to both treatments at 7 °C. Hepatic lactate dehydrogenase activity was lower at 16 °C than at 7 °C in fish from the control treatment. The activity of β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was unaffected by temperature or Mn. These results suggest that Mn, combined with high temperature, may affect mitochondrial function leading to a decrease in aerobic capacity. In response to the decline of cellular respiration capacity, metabolic pathways responded differently. Aerobic glycolysis was stimulated, while lipid metabolism showed no metabolic adjustment. This study represents one of the first steps towards understanding Mn toxicity in the context of climate change in a cold-water stenothermic species, and its impact on fish health and metabolism.",

The incorporation of natural products into cancer treatment has the potential to mitigate many of the side effects commonly associated with chemotherapy. This study builds on the advantages of enhancing the anticancer activity of natural flavonoids through metal chelation by synthesizing a natural antioxidant flavonoid complex, termed Lu-Mn nanozyme, which involves the chelation of luteolin with manganese ions. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Lu-Mn exhibits a strong affinity for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and effectively catalyzes the generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) from H2O2 within the tumor microenvironment. The administration of the Lu-Mn nanozyme not only induced apoptosis in tumor cells by upregulating the expression of cleaved caspase3 and caspase9 but also activated ferroptosis through downregulation of the NRF2-GPX4 signaling pathway. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that Lu-Mn possesses significant antitumor efficacy and a favorable safety profile. Collectively, these findings suggest that luteolin, through its chelation with metal ions, has considerable potential for application in cancer treatment.",

However, most of patients with malignant cancer receiving traditional therapies have tumor recurrence and short-term 5-year survival.

Meanwhile, CMP potentiates anti-tumor immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to induce tumor regression. CMP improves the tumor antigen processing and presentation of dendritic cells and tumor-associated macrophages, and further promotes CD8+ T cell responses, especially for cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and transitory exhausted CD8+ T cells. Additionally, CMP downregulates the proportion of Treg cells and CTLA-4 expression on Treg cells. Notably, CMP induces systemic immune responses against distant tumors and long-term immune memory. Furthermore, CMP synergized with PD-L1 mAb promotes tumor inhibition and sustains the anti-tumor efficacy post PD-L1 mAb treatment. Collectively, this strategy has the clinically therapeutic potential for tumors by facilitating cuproptosis in tumor cells and anti-tumor immune responses.",

One-day-old Ross 308 male chicks (n = 384) were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments with eight replicate pens per treatment and 12 birds per pen. The treatments were as follows: (1) inorganic trace mineral ZnSO4 110 ppm, CuSO4 16 ppm, MnO 120 ppm (ITM); (2) MMHAC Zn 40 ppm, Cu 10 ppm, Mn 40 ppm (M10); (3) Inorganic trace mineral ZnSO4 110 ppm, tribasic copper chloride 125 ppm, MnO 120 ppm (T125); (4) MMHAC Zn 40 ppm, Cu 30 ppm, Mn 40 ppm (M30). The birds were fed nutritionally complete wheat sorghum soybean meal-based diets from days 0 to 42 with three feeding phases including starter (days 0-10), grower (days 10-21), and finisher (days 21-42). The findings revealed that birds on the T125, M10, and M30 groups possibly had higher feed intake (p = 0.052) and higher weight gain (p < 0.063) than birds on the ITM group from days 0 to 42. Furthermore, birds fed the M30 diet had higher thigh and drumstick weights compared to those fed the ITM diet at day 42 (p = 0.05). Additionally, birds offered the M30 diet had increased ileal Cu digestibility compared to birds offered the M10 and ITM diets at day 21 (p = 0.006). Gizzard erosion scores and bone parameters were similar between the dietary treatments. Hence, the supplementation of MMHACs to broiler diets at 30 ppm may be a more suitable strategy to increase weight gain and the thigh and drumstick processing weight while maintaining the bone health of broiler chickens."

      "abstract": "Organic matter, serving as a carbon source and energy provider for microbial activities driving manganese oxidation in soil, plays a vital role in the biogeochemical processes underlying the formation of biological manganese oxides (BMOs) and regulating heavy metal (HMs) mobility within soil profiles. The interactions between BMOs and organic matter, their environmental behavior, and practical field applications remain poorly understood. In this study, the remediation effectiveness of organic fertilizer (OF) and manganese-oxidizing bacteria (B) in addressing arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) co-contamination in soil was evaluated, alongside the resulting elemental migration within the soil profile, uptake by maize, and post-remediation soil health. A 400-day field experiment demonstrated that compared with the control, treatment with 1.0 % organic fertilizer promoted the transformation of HMs chemical form from relatively active to stable fraction, significantly controlling Cd and Pb accumulation in maize roots (p < 0.05). Conversely, treatment of B decreased the bioavailability of As by 23.9 % but increased the bioavailability of Cd and Pb by 10.9 % and 20.2 %, respectively. Thus, it significantly increased Pb content in leaves and additional attention should be paid to its feed and food health risks. Under the combined BOF treatment (bacteria + organic fertilizer), high fixation efficiency of As (42.3 %), Cd (16.8 %), and Pb (13.2 %) was achieved through chemical transformation, reduced leaching risks, break the nucleation spatial locations, and the microbial-mineral pump mechanism. BOF treatment also significantly increased the relative abundance of Actinomycetes (+15.8 %) and Proteobacteria (+13.3 %) at the phylum level, suggesting those microorganisms possibly were persistently recruited in biomineralization nucleation. Soil enzyme activity analysis revealed that only treatment B reduced sucrase activity, while urease and catalase activities were not significantly affected in any treatment. Principal component analysis indicated that pH was a critical environmental driver of the biogeochemical cycling of Cd and Pb. Furthermore, maize absorption of nutrients such as iron and phosphorus influenced the transport and mobility of HMs. This study highlights the effectiveness of BOF treatment in simultaneously stabilizing As, Cd, and Pb, while enhancing the adaptability of in-situ remediation materials to the soil, making it a promising strategy for remediating HMs-contaminated soils.",

Here, we present a multifunctional pH-sensitive core-shell nanoparticle containing quercetin (QCT), termed AHA@MnP/QCT NPs, designed for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Mechanistic studies indicated that QCT and Mn2+ exhibited excellent peroxidase-like (POD-like) activity, catalysing the conversion of endogenous hydrogen peroxide into highly toxic hydroxyl radicals through a Fenton-like reaction, depleting glutathione (GSH), promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and inducing ferroptosis. Additionally, Mn2+ could activate the cGAS-STING signalling pathway and promote the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of activated T cells, thus inducing tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD). Furthermore, it exhibited effective T2-weighted MRI enhancement for tumor imaging, making them valuable for clinical diagnosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that AHA@MnP/QCT NPs enabled non-invasive imaging and tumor treatment, which presented a one-stone-for-two-birds strategy for combining tumor diagnosis and treatment, with broad potential for clinical application in non-small cell lung cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "A large amount of water-soluble waste salts is produced from traditional electrolytic manganese metal industry (EMMWS), and landfill treatment of the EMMWS increases the risk of pollution of the surrounding water and soil. The EMMWS mainly comprises sulphates with highly active components that can be recycled as secondary resources. Herein, a simple and efficient process comprising four-stage precipitation and separation, two-stage crystallisation, molten salt treatment, and water-leaching is proposed for comprehensive treatment of the EMMWS, as well as the recovery of manganese, magnesium, and ammonium, systematically investing the feasibility of this strategy. The results indicate that 95.3% Mn in the saturated EMMWS solution containing NH3 can be selectively oxidised to Mn oxides by O2(g), and the residual Mn can be thoroughly removed to 0.31 mg/L with (NH4)2S2O8 oxidation. 92.78% Mg in the solution after Mn removal can be precipitated as 4MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·4H2O with NH4HCO3 and NH3·H2O, and the 98.81% of residual Mg can be removed as struvite with concentrated H3PO4. (NH4)2SO4 product can be obtained by crystallisation after Mn and Mg separation. 97.49% Mn in the Mn oxides can be converted into MnSO4 via (NH4)2SO4 molten salt treatment, and a light pink MnSO4·H2O product is obtained with water-leaching and crystallisation operations. Following the proposed process, the Mg, Mn, and NH4+/NH3 in EMMWS are recycled as 4MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·4H2O, struvite, MnSO4·H2O, and (NH4)2SO4 products. All the products obtained meet the relevant national standards. Economic analysis shows that a profit of US$282.45 might be achieved for each ton of EMMWS treated. This process is of great significance for the effective treatment of EMMWS and the recovery of manganese, magnesium, and ammonium resources.",

However, previous studies have not combined Mn-oxidizing microalgae to reclaim Mn with woodchip substrates for nitrogen removal from tailwater. Here, a two-stage bioreactor system was constructed to recover Mn by microalgal-mediated bio-oxidation in an algae reactor (AR) and remove nitrogen by denitrification in a woodchip reactor (WR). The results showed that up to 100 % of Mn2+ in the tailwater was removed after a 3-day incubation period. The maximum amount of biogenerated Mn oxide nanoparticles reached 13.34 mg/L with Mn4+ as the main Mn valence. Mn recovery reached 65.69 % through precipitate collection, and the NH4+-N removal efficiency reached 97 % in the AR. Mn oxidation by algae might promote oxidative removal of NH4+-N. NO3--N and total nitrogen removal efficiencies in the WR reached 82-90 % and 65-87 %, respectively, which was attributed to denitrification. The predominance of the denitrification gene narG in the WR may have driven the efficient nitrate removal. Flavobacterium, Acidovora, Massilia, Arcticibacter, and Acinetobacter were the most abundant genera in the WR and represented dominant denitrifying bacteria in the woodchip microbiome, indicating their important contribution to denitrification. Overall, the combined application of Mn-oxidizing algae and woodchip-denitrifying bioreactors may represent an efficient treatment technology for electrolytic manganese wastewater remediation.",

      "abstract": "Manganese dioxide (MnO2), lauded for its biocompatibility and distinctive optical and physical characteristics, has become an indispensable material in the biomedical field, showing immense potential in disease detection, treatment, and prevention. Particularly, the ability of MnO2 nanoparticles to oxidize glutathione (GSH) to its oxidized form has positioned them as pivotal players in GSH sensing. However, conventional preparation methods, whether top-down or bottom-up, often result in nanoparticles that require multi-step processing and modification to achieve good dispersion in physiological conditions, which is both time-consuming and complex. To address this, a rapid and efficient method was developed for producing well-dispersed and stable MnO2 nanoparticles using tannic acid to reduce potassium permanganate. The polyphenolic structure of tannic acid not only facilitates the reduction process but also enhances the dispersibility of the nanoparticles in biological environments. In addition, PEG could improve the stability of MnO2 nanoparticles and also reduce their size. Moreover, we demonstrate the application of these nanoparticles in a colorimetric assay for GSH detection, leveraging their ability to react with GSH to produce Mn2+. Furthermore, these nanoparticles were utilized in a colorimetric assay for GSH detection, harnessing their reactivity with GSH to generate Mn2+. Beyond this, the MnO2 nanoparticles exhibit potential for the loading of a spectrum of molecules, including small molecules, peptides, DNA, RNA, and proteins, through electrostatic interactions, π-π stacking, and the inherent reactivity of polyphenols. This groundbreaking strategy heralds a new era for MnO2 in the realm of theranostic agent delivery, offering a promising avenue for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy in biomedical applications."

Pervious concrete cylinders were also used to model length requirements for a permeable reactive barrier to treat field-scale AMD. From an initial natural AMD pH of ∼4.1, approximately 600 min of contact time with pervious concrete was needed to reach a neutral pH.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Its complex molecular mechanisms and high tumor heterogeneity pose significant challenges for clinical treatment. The manganese ion metabolism family plays a crucial role in various biological processes, and the abnormal expression of the NUDT3 gene in multiple cancers has drawn considerable attention. This study aims to systematically analyze the expression characteristics of the NUDT3 gene in lung adenocarcinoma and its association with tumor progression, integrating single-cell transcriptomic analysis and experimental validation using cell lines. METHODS: This study employed a comprehensive set of analytical approaches. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of two normal and four lung adenocarcinoma samples from the GSE149655 dataset was performed using the Seurat package to identify and annotate distinct cell populations, focusing on epithelial and macrophage subtypes. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were applied to assess the functional enrichment and expression profiles of the manganese ion metabolism family across 14 cancers. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted to evaluate the relative mRNA expression of NUDT3 in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines compared to BEAS-2B normal bronchial epithelial cell lines. GAPDH was used as the reference gene for normalization, and the relative expression levels of NUDT3 in these cell lines were analyzed to confirm bioinformatics findings. RESULTS: NUDT3 was found to be significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and highly correlated with tumor mutation burden (TMB) and mutation enrichment (MEs). Single-cell transcriptomic analyses demonstrated elevated NUDT3 expression in lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells, with expression levels increasing in cells associated with advanced tumor stages. Furthermore, qPCR analysis confirmed the upregulation of NUDT3 in A549 cells compared to BEAS-2B cells, consistent with transcriptomic data. These results also highlighted significant expression differences of the manganese ion metabolism family across various cancers, including BLCA, BRCA, and COAD, with notable NUDT3 mutations enriched in these cancers. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the critical role of NUDT3 in lung adenocarcinoma progression and its potential as a therapeutic target. These findings contribute to the understanding of the manganese ion metabolism family in cancer biology and provide a foundation for precision therapies targeting NUDT3 in lung adenocarcinoma."

As a kind of nanomaterial with enzyme-like activity, nanozyme has shown outstanding advantages in treating AKI according to recent reports. Herein, we assess the potential of manganese-based nanozymes (MnO2-BSA NPs) with excellent biosafety in effectively alleviating AKI. Our findings in vitro and in vivo reveal that MnO2-BSA NPs exert regulatory effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. These effects are mediated through activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 and PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathways. Notably, it was observed that the cytoprotective effect of MnO2-BSA NPs is abrogated upon inhibition of Nrf2 expression, highlighting the important role of this transcription factor in cellular protection. In summary, the study demonstrates the protective effect of MnO2-BSA NPs in AKI and provides the molecular mechanisms involved, which can contribute to the advancement of potential therapeutic interventions for nanozyme-based treatments.",

      "abstract": "Manganese ions (Mn2+) are an immune activator that enhances the activation of both cGAS and STING proteins. The STING signaling activation and subsequential immune responses are predominantly associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, ER targeting of Mn2+ in the subcellular compartments would promote the activation of STING signaling pathways. Herein, we report the design of ER-targeted manganese-based nanocomplexes (NCs) by complexation of Mn2+ with a zwitterionic polymer, poly[2-(N-oxide-N,N-dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate] (OPDMA). The Mn/OPDMA nanocomplexes (Mn/OPDMA NCs) keep a long blood circulation for tumor accumulation and trigger adsorption-mediated transcytosis for extravasation and deep tumor penetration. Notably, in the tumor-associated macrophages, the Mn/OPDMA NCs can preferentially translocate to their ERs, significantly enhancing cGAS-STING pathway activation for tumor-associated macrophage polarization and IFN-β secretion. In mouse colon and hepatocellular cancer models, the intravenously administrated Mn/OPDMA NCs efficiently remodel tumor immune microenvironment, greatly retard tumor growths by 2.4- to 5-fold, and prolong the mouse survivals compared to free Mn2+-treated mice. This study provides the ER-targeted delivery of Mn2+ that achieves robust STING activation and, thus, potent systemic tumor inhibition without the toxicity of free Mn2+.",

      "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is involved in plant metabolism as an enzyme cofactor. However, the role of Mn in the formation of volatile compounds in grapes has rarely been studied. To address this gap, this study explored the effect of foliar Mn application on the aroma traits of grapes and wine. Mn nutrient solutions at different concentrations (0 (CK), 300, 1200, and 2400 mg/L) were sprayed on grapevines in 2017 and 2018 and the volatile compounds, odor activity, and sensory features of grapes and wine were investigated. The results showed that Mn application significantly increased Mn content in grape leaves and fruits at harvest. Compared with CK, the total volatile content of grapes was significantly increased by Mn treatment in both years because of the promotion of the accumulation of alcohols and esters. Particularly, 1200 mg/L Mn treatment resulted in a higher sensory score than CK, especially in terms of intensity, duration, and harmony. Multivariate analysis and odor activity values jointly identified eight volatile compounds (ethyl acetate, phenylethyl acetate, and phenylethyl alcohol, etc.) as key odorants that contribute to the floral and fruity flavors of Mn-treated wine. Overall, this study indicated that a moderate concentration of Mn is beneficial for improving the fragrance characteristics of grapes and wines. The results have implications for micronutrient management of grapevines to improve wine flavor quality."

      "abstract": "Deficiency or excess of mineral elements in the environment is a primary factor limiting crop yields and nutritional quality. Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) is an important aquatic crop in Asia, but the mechanism for accumulating mineral nutrients and coping with nutrient deficiency/excess is still largely unknown. Here, we identified NnMTP10, a member of the cation diffusion facilitator family, by screening the cDNA library of lotus. Subcellular localization to the plasma membrane, increased manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) tolerance and reduced metal accumulation in yeast transformants demonstrated that the protein functions as an exporter to mediate the efflux of Mn and Fe. Arabidopsis overexpressing NnMTP10 exhibited less Mn accumulation in roots, increased long-distance transport to shoots, and increased tolerance to Mn stress under high-Mn conditions. However, the accumulation and tolerance of Fe in Arabidopsis transformants are opposite to those of Mn. Further analysis revealed that excessive Fe in the root apoplast exported by NnMTP10 was sequestrated by the cell wall, thereby reducing the transport of Fe to the shoot. Correspondingly, the expression of NnMTP10 in the roots of lotus was increased under the high-Mn treatment but decreased under the high-Fe treatment. These results suggest that NnMTP10 is involved in the long-distance transport of Mn and Fe in lotus and may play a role in coordinating the adaptation to stresses caused by excessive Mn and Fe.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment remains a formidable challenge, as current therapeutic approaches provide only marginal relief and fail to reverse the underlying tissue damage. This study aims to develop a novel composite material combining enzymatic nanoparticles and nerve growth factor (NGF) to modulate the immune microenvironment and enhance SCI repair. METHODS: CeMn nanoparticles (NP) and CeMn NP-polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanozymes were synthesized via sol-gel reaction and DSPE-mPEG modification. Transmission Electron Microscopy, Selected-Area Electron Diffraction, X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy confirmed their crystalline structure, mixed-valence states, and redox properties. Size uniformity, biocompatibility, and catalytic activity were assessed via hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, and elemental analysis. The Lightgel/NGF/CeMn NP-PEG composite was synthesized and characterized via electron microscopy, compression testing, rheological analysis, NGF release kinetics, and 30-day degradation studies. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the composite on SCI. RESULTS: The Lightgel/NGF/CeMn NP-PEG composite was successfully synthesized, exhibiting favorable physical properties. At a CeMn NP-PEG concentration of 4 µg/mL, the composite maintained cell viability and demonstrated enhanced biological activity. It also showed superior mechanical properties and an effective NGF release profile. Notably, the composite significantly upregulated the expression of nerve growth-associated proteins, reduced inflammatory cytokines, scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS), and promoted M2 macrophage polarization by inhibiting the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. In a rat SCI model, it facilitated functional recovery and attenuated inflammation. CONCLUSION: The Lightgel/NGF/CeMn NP-PEG composite shows significant therapeutic promise for SCI, effectively eliminating ROS, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and supporting neuronal regeneration. These effects substantially enhance motor function in SCI rats, positioning it as a promising candidate for future clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "In situ vaccine (ISV) can activate the anti-tumor immune system by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) at the tumor site. However, the development of tumor ISV still faces challenges due to insufficient tumor antigens released by tumor cells and the existence of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). Targeting the STING pathway has been reported to enhance the adjuvant effects of in situ tumor vaccines by initiating innate immunity. Based on this, we developed a potent in situ cancer vaccine, MBMA-RGD ISV, which simultaneously induces ICD and activates the STING pathway to achieve sustained anti-tumor immunity. Specifically, a water-soluble prodrug Mit-ALA was synthesized from the chemotherapeutic agent mitoxantrone (Mit) and the photosensitizer precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) by pH-responsive ester bonds, which was then loaded into pre-synthesized BSA-MnO2 nanoparticles and functionalized with the targeting Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide to obtain MBMA-RGD ISV. This ISV actively targets tumor cells by binding integrin receptors and then gradually releases antitumor components in response to tumor microenvironment (TME). The released 5-ALA is metabolized in mitochondria to produce photosensitizer PpIX. Under laser irradiation, the photodynamic property of PpIX coupled with the photothermal effect of Mit synergistically induced ICD, resulting in the release of tumor antigens and evoking adaptive immunity. Meanwhile, released Mn2+ and Mit synergistically activate the STING pathway by inducing DNA damage, further enhancing antitumor immunity. Moreover, large amounts of oxygen released by MnO2 relieved the hypoxia microenvironment, thus sensitizing photodynamic therapy and improving the immunosuppressive state of TME. Therefore, MBMA-RGD ISV efficiently activates systemic antitumor immunity in vitro and in vivo, providing new strategies and ideas for the development of tumor ISV. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Using a biocompatible BSA-MnO2 nanoplatform, we developed a dual-prodrug tumor in situ vaccine (ISV) with tumor microenvironment-responsive action for synergistic cancer immunotherapy. Once internalized by tumor cells, the MBMA-RGD ISV responded to intracellular H+, H2O2, and GSH, releasing its therapeutic \"cargo.\" Under laser irradiation, the combined effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) induced immunogenic cell death (ICD), effectively recruiting and stimulating dendritic cells (DCs). Concurrently, STING pathway activation, triggered by DNA damage, enhanced DC maturation. Moreover, the MnO2 component alleviated hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment by releasing significant amounts of oxygen, which facilitated the repolarization of macrophages from the M2 phenotype to the M1 phenotype. Therefore, MBMA-RGD ISV demonstrated potent suppression of tumor metastasis and recurrence without notable side effects in mouse tumor models.",

The rational design of nanoenzymes that possess the ability to respond to and regulate the TME is driving a new direction in catalytic immunotherapy. In this study, we designed a multifunctional manganese (Mn)-based nanoenzyme that is responsive to acidic pH and overxpressed H2O2 at tumor site and holds capability of modulating hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME for synergistic anti-tumor photothermal/photodynamic/immunotherapy. We found that this artificial nanoenzyme promoted peroxidase-like and catalase-like activities and catalyzed the in-situ decomposition of H2O2, a metabolic waste product in the TME, into ∙OH and O2, resulting in a ROS burst for killing tumors and relieving hypoxic TME to enhance cancer therapy. Besides the photothermal effect and the enhancement of ROS burst-induced immunogenic cell death, combination of Mn2+ released from Mn-based nanoenzyme in acidic TME and programmed death-ligand 1 blockade triggered a significant anti-tumor immune response. A remarkable in vivo synergistic therapeutic effect was achieved with effective inhibition of primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. Therefore, this TME-responsive Mn-based nanoenzyme offers a safe and efficient platform for reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and achieving synergistic anti-tumor immunotherapy."

      "abstract": "Groundwater is widely threatened by hazardous manganese and ammonia. In present study, a novel gravity-driven fixed-bed ceramic membrane filtration (GDFBCM) with critical PAC-MnOx-ceramsite filters was built to address these issues. Static ceramsite filters in GDCM significantly increased membrane flux from 11 L/m2·h to 18 L/m2·h on the 50th day of filtration. Their synergistic effects with aerated fluidization further reduced membrane fouling by 29 %. Ammonia removal was improved from 62 % to 78 % by ceramsite filters after accelerating nitrification and denitrification by stimulating Nitrospira and Nitrosomonas. Metabolite secretion, ATP level, bacteria abundance and microorganism community analysis evidenced that ceramsite filters acted as immobilization carriers to stimulate Mn-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas and Hyphomicrobium) for greater biological oxidation of dissolved manganese. According to FTIR, XRD, XPS spectra and SEM-EDS mapping, the facilitated formation of two-dimensional sheet-like birnessite on ceramsite filters established a virtuous cycle for continuous manganese removal. These processes further benefited from the increased hydraulic retention time by denser membranes. The excellent resistance to suddenly increasing pollution loading confirmed the outstanding applicability of GDFBCM. Energy consumption analysis also indicated that GDFBCM was an energy-saving system for groundwater treatment with the specific energy consumption of less than 4 × 10-3 kWh/m3.",

      "abstract": "This study explores variations in groundwater (GW) pH, conductivity, ammonium, iron, and manganese parameters to reveal prospective interactions having an impact on the dissolved metal concentrations. To this end, bivariate and partial correlation procedures were applied to the data to obtain incisive evaluation. Besides characterisation efforts, photocatalytic iron and manganese removal experiments were also carried out with Ni-doped TiO2 nano-composite thin films (TFs) on real GW samples. UV-A (365 nm) An LED array was used as the illumination source. The experimental setup was based on three treatment routes including photocatalytic oxidation (PCO), NaOH-aided precipitation and PCO with simultaneous precipitation (SPCO-P). The main statistical analysis and treatment efforts have been performed on data and samples of a single well, respectively (N = 15). However, extended statistical analysis has also been performed on larger data groups (N = 1366) obtained from different GW sources as well. Analytical results have revealed that about 90% of iron and manganese were in oxidised forms which do not precipitate by simple pH regulation. Statistical analysis has also revealed significant interactions between metal concentrations and observed parameters depending on the level of pH and conductivity. Furthermore, the SPCO-P strategy has provided a four-fold increase in reaction rate (pseudo-first-order, kobs: 0.04 min-1). Removal efficiencies of iron and manganese also increased from 10% to 96% - 85%, respectively."

      "abstract": "The cGAS-STING pathway is pivotal in initiating antitumor immunity. However, tumor metabolism, particularly glycolysis, negatively regulates the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Herein, Mn galvanic cells (MnG) are prepared via liquid-phase exfoliation and in situ galvanic replacement to modulate tumor metabolism, thereby enhancing cGAS-STING activation for bidirectional synergistic H2-immunotherapy. The obtained MnG can be etched by water, enabling efficient and sustained generation of H2 gas and Mn2+. MnG not only activated and amplified the cGAS-STING pathway through the sustained release of Mn2+ but also regulated tumor glucose metabolism to inhibit the expression of three prime repair exonuclease 2 (TREX2), thereby synergistically enhancing the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. The injection of MnG into tumors resulted in a robust immune response, thereby providing favorable support for antitumor therapy. Consequently, the combination of MnG with immune checkpoint blockade therapy resulted in significant suppression of both primary tumors and distant tumors. Furthermore, the MnG-lipiodol dispersion exhibited remarkable efficacy in combination with transarterial embolization (TAE)-gas-immunotherapy in a rabbit orthotopic liver tumor model. The present study underscores the significance of employing a metal galvanic cell strategy for enhanced immunotherapy, thereby offering a novel approach for rational design of bioactive materials to augment immunotherapeutic effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Effective delivery of therapeutic agents for solid tumour treatment is impeded by multiple obstacles, such as aberrant interstitial fluid pressure and high density of the extracellular matrix, which causes impaired penetration to deep avascular tumour tissue that exists in a hypoxic immune cold environment. Only limited tumoricidal effects have been achieved with traditional nanomedicine due to its inefficient penetration and the multiple resistant effects that exist in the tumour microenvironment. Herein, a new chemo-dynamic immunotherapy (CDIT) is proposed based on a transcytosis tumour oxygenator (MnPO2/MC3) with effective chemo-dynamic effects. As a CDIT agent, MnPO2/MC3 is designed and synthesized to enhance deep tumour tissue penetration as well as provide relief of hypoxia to decrease immunosuppression. MnPO2/MC3 is orchestrated by an inner manganese core and double lipid outer layer. The outer layer is constructed by a tumour pH-cationizable outer lipid (D-Lin-MC3-DMA, MC3) layer and O2-loading inner layer. The MC3 lipid endows MnPO2/MC3 with tumour-responsive transcytosis potential, which instead delivers oxygen and Mn deep into tumour tissues. MnPO2/MC3 catalyses hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl radicals by Mn2+ and increases CD8+ T cell infiltration. The oxygenation and ROS burst by MnPO2/MC3 effectively altered the tumour cold immune microenvironment so that adaptive anti-tumoral immunity was enhanced. MnPO2/MC3-mediated CDIT serving as an effective tumour oxygenator and ROS initiator, effectively suppressed tumour growth while enhancing adaptive anti-tumour immunity.",

      "abstract": "The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway exhibits great potential in remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and initiating antitumor immunity. However, how to effectively activate STING and avoid undesired toxicity after systemic administration remains challenging. Herein, platinum(IV)-backboned polymer prodrug-coated manganese oxide nanoparticles (DHP/MnO2NP) with pH/redox dual responsive properties are developed to precisely release cisplatin and Mn2+ in the tumor microenvironment and synergistically amplify STING activation. In vitro, we demonstrate that DHP/MnO2NP can effectively induce tumor cell DNA damage and leak into the cytoplasm, cooperating with Mn2+ to promote STING activation and significantly upregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, DHP/MnO2NP can selectively release cisplatin and Mn2+ to mediate tumor killing while reducing toxicity to normal cells. In vivo, DHP/MnO2NP exerted increased therapeutic efficacy by inducing STING activation and initiating robust antitumor immunity. Specifically, DHP/MnO2NP effectively skewed tumor-associated macrophages toward a proinflammatory phenotype and upregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in tumors by up to 99-fold relative to the control. And the infiltration of CD8+ T cells was also significantly increased. When STING signaling was blocked, the antitumor effects and immunostimulatory efficacy of DHP/MnO2NP were significantly inhibited. Moreover, DHP/MnO2NP possess the advantage of enhanced tumor homing and retention, resulting in stronger and longer-lasting anticancer effects. Overall, DHP/MnO2NP provide a potential platform for potentiating cancer chemoimmunotherapy and hold promise for precision treatment.",

It was shown that the infection of potatoes with P. carotovorum reduced the root formation of plants and the concentration of pigments in leaf tissues. The treatment of plants with Cu/AG NC before infection with P. carotovorum stimulated leaf formation and increased the concentration of pigments in them. A similar effect was observed when potatoes were exposed to Mn/AG NC, and an increase in growth and root formation was also observed. The infection of plants with Cms inhibited plant growth. Treatment with each of the NCs mitigated this negative effect of the phytopathogen. At the same time, Se/AG and Mn/AG NCs promoted leaf formation. The Se/AG NC increased the biomass of Cms-infected plants. The treatment of plants with NCs before infection showed a decrease in the intensity of the colonization of plants by bacteria. The Se/AG NC had the maximum effect, which is probably due to its high antioxidant capacity. Thus, the NCs are able to mitigate the negative effects of bacterial phytopathogens on vegetation and the intensity of colonization by these bacteria during the infection of cultivated plants."

However, research and application of the autotrophic NH4+-N removal process mediated by manganese oxides (MnOx) in wastewater treatment are currently limited. This study established autotrophic NH4+-N removal sludge reactors mediated by various MnOx types, including δ-MnO2 (δ-MSR), β-MnO2 (β-MSR), α-MnO2 (α-MSR), and natural Mn ore (MOSR), investigating their NH4+-N removal performances and mechanisms under different initial N loading and pH conditions. During the 330 d operation, the reactors exhibited NH4+-N removal efficiencies in the order of δ-MSR > α-MSR > β-MSR > MOSR. Notably, metal-reducing bacteria (Candidatus Brocadia, Dechloromonas, and Rhodocyclaceae) and Mn(II) oxidizing bacteria (Pseudomonas and Zoogloea) were enriched in the reactors, especially in the δ-MSR. The presence of these microorganisms facilitated the reduction of Mn(IV) and utilized the generated Mn(II) to drive autotrophic denitrification (MnOAD), thereby completing the Mn(IV)/Mn(II) cycle and enhancing N removal in the system. An active Mn cycle displayed in δ-MSR, which could be demonstrated by the formation of petal-shaped biogenic MnOx and the increased abundance of Mn cycling genes (MtrCDE, MtrA, MtrB, and CotA, etc.). Meanwhile, genes involved in N metabolism were enriched, particularly functional genes associated with nitrification and denitrification. In this study, the coupling of Mnammox and MnOAD was realized via the Mn cycle, providing a new perspective on the application of autotrophic N removal technologies in wastewater treatment.",

To elucidate the Mn detoxification mechanisms in stylo, this study investigated the excess Mn-regulated metabolic profile of stylo roots and examined the role of metabolic enzymes in Mn tolerance. Excess Mn triggered oxidative stress in the two stylo genotypes tested. However, Mn-stimulated activation of antioxidant defense systems was observed in the Mn-tolerant genotype RY5 but not in the Mn-sensitive genotype TF0317. Metabolomic analysis of the Mn-tolerant RY5 roots revealed numerous excess Mn-responsive metabolites, mainly related to flavonoids and phenolic acids. Furthermore, a set of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid/flavonoid pathway were upregulated by excess Mn in stylo roots, especially in RY5. We characterized the excess Mn-inducible gene SgPAL2, encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. SgPAL2 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Compared to control plants, SgPAL2 overexpression led to increases in shoot and root dry weights under Mn-excess conditions, whereas SgPAL2 suppression had the opposite effect. Moreover, SgPAL2 overexpression dramatically altered secondary metabolism, particularly flavonoid metabolism. In a bioassay, the inhibition of root elongation caused by excess Mn was alleviated by treatment with exogenous calycosin, an SgPAL2-regulated isoflavonoid, suggesting calycosin can detoxify Mn. Taken together, these findings indicate that SgPAL2 plays a critical role in enhancing Mn tolerance in stylo through metabolic regulation."

Comprehensive characterization was performed using FT-IR, Raman, XRD, BET, SEM, DRS and Zeta potential techniques. XRD analysis confirmed the cubic spinel structure of MnFe2O4, with characteristic peaks at 2θ = 32, 35, 48, 53, 62, and 64°. BET analysis revealed a high specific surface area of 442.57 m2/g and a pore diameter of 2.36 nm for the MnFe2O4/GO/CS nanocomposite. SEM imaging showed polyhedral MnFe2O4 particles (11-33 nm) deposited on a wrinkled graphite oxide matrix. DRS analysis indicated band gap energies of 3.1 eV for MnFe2O4, 3.0 eV for MnFe2O4/GO, and 3.5 eV for MnFe2O4/GO/CS. Zeta potential measurements showed a positive surface charge (+ 36.8 mV) for MnFe2O4/GO/CS. The MnFe2O4/GO/CS nanocomposite exhibited exceptional photocatalytic performance under UV light irradiation. It achieved 99.9 and 99.5% removal of Reactive Red 198 dye and Brilliant Blue FCF 133, respectively. The photocatalytic process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics (R2 = 0.99). In real textile wastewater treatment, the nanocomposite reduced BOD from 889 to 0.86 mg/L and COD from 1227 to 74 mg/L, with 96% dye removal. Also, MnFe2O4/GO/CS showed excellent performance under sunlight irradiation and maintained high removal efficiencies over multiple cycles, demonstrating good reusability. This study highlights the potential of the MnFe2O4-based nanocomposites as versatile and sustainable solutions for remediating dye-contaminated water."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Enamel/dentin discs adapted to artificial pulp chambers were distributed according to treatments: CN-No treatment; CP22%-22%CP; CP22 + 2MnO2-22%CP + 2 mg/mLMnO2; CP22% + 6MnO2-22%CP + 6 mg/mLMnO2; CP22% + 10MnO2-22%CP + 10 mg/mLMnO2 applied for 2 h for 15 days. Color change-CC (ΔE00 and ΔWID) (n = 8) was determined at 5, 10, and 15-day periods (ANOVA/Sidak). Trans-amelodentinal cytotoxicity (TC) was assessed after applying the extracts to cultured MDPC-23 cells, which were analyzed concerning their viability (Vi) (n = 8) and oxidative stress (OxS) (n = 8). The amount of hydroxyl radical (OH•) (n = 4) generated by H2O2 degradation (ANOVA/Sidak), and trans-amelodentinal diffusion of H2O2 (n = 8) (ANOVA/Tukey) were also evaluated. RESULTS: CP22 + 10MnO2 presented higher CC than CP22 for both evaluated equations in all analysis periods (p ≤ 0.04). Among bleached groups, CP22 + 10MnO2 presented the highest OH• generation (p ≤ 0.02) and the lowest trans-amelodentinal diffusion of H2O2 (p ≤ 0.0004). Therefore, MDPC-23 cells in CP22 + 10MnO2 exhibited the lowest OxS (p < 0.0001) and consequently the highest Vi (p ≤ 0.0146). CONCLUSION: Besides increasing the bleaching efficacy, the strategy of adding 10 mg/mL of MnO2 to a 22%CP bleaching gel also reduces significantly the trans-amelodentinal diffusion of H2O2, diminishing the cytotoxicity caused by at-home bleaching therapy. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The addition of MnO2 to a 22% carbamide peroxide bleaching gel improves the color change and reduces the cytotoxicity effects of the product, making at-home bleaching faster and biologically safer."

      "abstract": "Sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) has been identified as an entry receptor for hepatitis B virus (HBV), but the molecular events of the viral post-endocytosis steps remain obscure. In this study, we discovered that manganese (Mn) could strongly inhibit HBV infection in NTCP-reconstituted HepG2 cells without affecting viral replication. We therefore profiled the antiviral effects of Mn2+ in an attempt to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved in early HBV infection. Intriguingly, Mn2+ conspicuously stimulated lysosomal activity, as evidenced by hyperactivation of mTORC1 and increased endo/lysosomal acidity. After HBV-triggered internalization, the NTCP receptor was sorted to late endosomal compartments by the ESCRT machinery in concert with the invading virion. The establishment of HBV infection was found to be independent of lysosomal fusion-driven late endosome maturation; Mn2+-induced lysosomal hyperfunction virtually impaired infection, suggesting that virions may gain cytosolic access directly from late endosomes. In contrast, suppression of lysosomal activity substantially enhanced HBV infection. Prolonged mTORC1 inactivation facilitated viral infection by depleting lysosomes and accelerating endocytic transport of virions. Notably, treatment with the natural steroidal alkaloid tomatidine recapitulated the effects of Mn2+ in stimulating lysosomal activity and exhibited potent anti-HBV activity in HepG2-NTCP cells and in proliferating human hepatocyte organoids. These findings provide new insights into the post-endocytosis events of HBV infection. The negative regulation of early HBV infection by endo/lysosomal activity makes it a promising target for antiviral therapies.",

This research evaluated and revealed the antibacterial efficacy of the MnO2/Dio@CS nanocomposite against Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The nanocomposite exhibited significant antibacterial activity, as evidenced by its ability to effectively inhibit bacterial growth and form distinct zones of inhibition.

      "abstract": "The development of efficient color conversion layers for μ-LED technology faces significant challenges owing to the limitations of materials that require binders. Binders are typically used to ensure uniform film formation in color-conversion layers, but they often cause optical losses, increase layer thickness, and introduce long-term stability issues. To address the limitations of materials requiring binders, cyclopropyltriphenylphosphonium manganese tetrabromide (CPTP2MnBr4) is synthesized, a novel lead-free metal halide. CPTP2MnBr4 exhibits unique solvent-based plasticity, which enables the formation of uniform films thinner than those formed with binders without the need for either heat treatment or binders. This approach eliminates the performance degradation typically associated with conventional binder systems such as optical losses and stability issues. Structural and optical analyses confirm its high luminescence efficiency and stability, supporting its potential applications in luminescent clays, direct ink writing, pattern printing, and ink drawing. Moreover, its successful application in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) and scintillators demonstrates that CPTP2MnBr4 can replace traditional binder systems, offering a solution to overcome the technical challenges in next-generation displays, lighting, and scintillator technologies."

      "abstract": "The abnormal expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is linked to the development of various diseases. Accurate determination of AChE activity as well as screening AChE inhibitors (AChEIs) holds paramount importance for early diagnosis and treatment of AChE-related diseases. Herein, a fluorescent and colorimetric dual-channel probe based on gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and manganese dioxide nanosheets (MnO2 NSs) was developed. The fluorescence of AuNCs was suppressed in the presence of MnO2 NSs, providing a platform for fluorescence-based detection. For colorimetric, the nanocomposites exhibited oxidase-like activity, rapidly catalyzing 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to generate a blue color. Thiocholine (TCh), produced through the enzymatic reaction of acetylthiocholine (ATCh) in the presence of AChE, can reduce the MnO2 NSs, thus recovering the suppressed fluorescence of AuNCs and decreasing oxidase-like activity. Based on this principle, a dual-mode assay for AChE detection was achieved. Compared to the commonly used single-signal detection, multi-mode detection can offer reliable and accurate results, due to its inherent self-validation and self-regulation capabilities. Under optimum conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) for AChE activity was 0.067 mU mL-1 (fluorescent mode) and 0.042 mU mL-1 (colorimetric mode). Moreover, the probe realized AChE detection in biological samples and AChEIs screening. This work showed the great prospects for early diagnosis of AChE-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Manganese (Mn), a trace element, has been documented to exert an important role in the metabolism of cholesterol. Cholesterol gallstone (CG) pathogenesis is directly linked to biliary cholesterol imbalance which could be due to diabetes complications or mismanagement. NF-κβ pathway, an inflammatory regulator, has been implicated in metabolic disease especially in the context of diabetes and gallstone formation. However, the management of cholesterol gallstones due to diabetes with trace elements is vague. This study investigates the probable role of manganese during CG formation due to diabetes complications. Eighty female Swiss mice were grouped: I (control), II (untreated CG), III and IV (normal mice treated 0.37 mg/kg and 0.74 mg/kg Mn, respectively), V and VI (CG treated 0.37 mg/kg and 0.74 mg/kg Mn, respectively), and VII and VIII (CG treated 75 mg/7 kg and 350 mg/kg aspirin, respectively). Experimental CG was induced with cholesterol-rich diets after alloxan-induced diabetes. On sacrifice, blood collected was evaluated for complete hematological analysis and biochemistry while the excised liver was assayed for biochemical variables. Results were subjected to one-way ANOVA values were expressed as Mean ± SEM and significant at p ≤ 0.05. Manganese treatment significantly increased packed cell volume, RBC count, and hemoglobin with decreased platelet and leukocyte counts, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and ALP), BUN, and creatinine levels in CG groups compared with untreated CG. Blood glucose, plasma low-density lipoproteins, and liver malodialdehyde levels were significantly reduced while liver nitric-oxide, sulfhydryl, and glutathione levels increased significantly in manganese-treated groups compared with untreated CG. Manganese significantly increased fecal iron contents in normal mice by the 2nd week. Hepatocytes and gallbladder histology appear normal in manganese-treated groups. Liver NF-Kβ immunoreactivity was downregulated in manganese-treated CG groups. Manganese attenuated experimental hyperglycemia-induced cholesterol gallstone by ameliorating liver oxidative stress and NF-Kβ inflammatory pathway."

However, the main absorption routes and target organs of NMC are unknown. This study aims to systematically investigate the main absorption routes and target organs of NMC. Male adult C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to acute exposure to NMC particles (Ni: Mn: Co = 5: 3: 2, mass median geometric diameter 9.15 μm) by intragastric administration, transdermal drug delivery, and oropharyngeal aspiration (OPA). The OPA group showed a significant increase in NMC metal levels in organs and blood compared to the other exposure routes. After OPA treatment (0.5 or 2 mg, once per day, 3 days), significantly increased metal levels were found in the lung, liver and kidney, but there was no dose-response effect. In the lung, obvious inflammation, and significant elevation of white blood cells, neutrophils and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were observed, all of which showed a dose-response effect. Reduced urine output and renal tubular cell loss, as well as dysregulated metabolic and immune functions as indicated by the hepatic transcriptome, were observed in NMC-exposed mice. Respiratory exposure is the main exposure route of NMC. Short-term respiratory exposure to NMC results in potential damage to the kidney and liver in addition to severe inflammation in the lung.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the protective effect of ginsenoside Rg1 against manganese (Mn)-induced hepatotoxicity, highlighting its role as a PPAR-γ activator and its impact on TLR4/MyD88/MAPK pathway. Manganese induces liver damage through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and inflammation. Rg1, a principal bioactive compound of ginseng, significantly alleviates Mn-induced liver injury. Rg1 markedly enhances the activities of SOD, GSH, and CAT, while reducing levels of MDA and ROS, indicating an improvement in antioxidant defense capacity. Furthermore, Rg1 decreases inflammatory markers iNOS, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12 and NO levels, underscoring its strong anti-inflammatory effects. Importantly, as a PPAR-γ activator, Rg1 upregulates PPAR-γ expression, subsequently inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/MAPK pathway. Additionally, silencing of PPAR-γ diminishes the protective effects of Rg1, while overexpression of PPAR-γ enhances them. The findings conclude that Rg1 exerts significant hepatoprotective effects against manganese-induced damage by activating PPAR-γ and modulating TLR4/MyD88/MAPK pathway, positioning it as a promising candidate for the treatment of Mn-induced hepatotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death distinct from apoptosis, was first identified in 2012 and is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since its discovery, ferroptosis has been linked to various diseases, with recent studies highlighting its potential in cancer therapy, particularly for targeting cancer cells that are resistant to traditional treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy. While iron has historically been central to ferroptosis, emerging evidence indicates that non-ferrous ions, especially manganese (Mn), also play a crucial role in modulating this process. Mn-based nanomaterials have shown significant promise in cancer treatment by enhancing ROS production, depleting antioxidant defenses, and inducing ferroptosis. Additionally, these materials offer advantages in tumor imaging, immunotherapy, and catalyzing the Fenton-like reactions essential for ferroptosis. This review delves into the mechanisms of Mn-induced ferroptosis, focusing on recent advancements in Mn-based nanomaterials and their applications in chemodynamic therapy and immunotherapy. By leveraging non-ferrous ion-mediated ferroptosis, these approaches provide a novel avenue for cancer treatment. Furthermore, this review explores the potential role of Mn-based nanomaterials in the lipid metabolism pathways involved in ferroptosis and highlights the advantages of Mn ions over other metals in promoting ferroptosis. These insights offer new perspectives for the development of tumor therapies centered on Mn-based nanomaterials.",

In this study, MnOx/carbon (Mn-C) composites were applied in biofilters to evaluate simultaneous removal of nitrate and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), with the single carbon composites as control. Results showed that the effluent concentrations of NO3--N and SMX were below 2.87 mg L-1 and 7.97 μg L-1 under hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6 h. The intermittent aeration optimized Mn cycle with treatment performance improved under lower HRT and Mn(II) accumulation decreased. Mn-C composites could reduce the emission of N2O, CO2 and CH4. The dominant genera gradually evolved from fermentation to glycogen aggregation, and from heterotrophic/sulfur autotrophic to heterotrophic denitrifiers by intracellular substance and manganese autotrophic/heterotrophic bacteria. Microbial network analysis indicated higher antagonism, lower modularity and shorter average path among microbes in Mn-C biofilters, which highlighted microbial differentiation and faster electron transfer. Improved functions of denitrification and Mn respiration, and the increasing genes encoding electron transfer chain, including NADH dehydrogenase, Cytc and ubiquinone, further elucidated the superiority of Mn-C composites.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, inflammatory airway disorder characterized by a gradual decline in lung function and increased oxidative stress. Both oxidative stress and inflammation are central to its pathophysiology, with trace elements such as zinc, copper, iron, manganese, magnesium, selenium, and calcium playing key roles in various cellular processes. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the role of trace elements in COPD, focusing on their involvement in disease pathogenesis and their therapeutic potential. Specifically, we examine the effects of zinc, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, and calcium in COPD. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive narrative review of the literature across databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, identifying studies that explore the therapeutic effects of trace elements in COPD. The studies included in the review consisted of cohort analyses, randomized controlled trials, and clinical investigations. RESULTS: Zinc, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, and calcium are critical to both the pathophysiology and management of COPD. These trace elements contribute to the regulation of inflammation, the modulation of oxidative stress, and the maintenance of lung function. Zinc and copper, for instance, reduce oxidative stress and modulate immune responses, while iron is essential for oxygen transport. Magnesium, manganese, selenium, and calcium are vital for muscle function, respiratory performance, reducing inflammation, and improving pulmonary function. CONCLUSIONS: The minerals zinc, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, and calcium may contribute to beneficial effects as part of the standard therapeutic management of COPD. Maintaining optimal levels of these trace elements may support the regulation of inflammatory processes, a reduction in oxidative stress, and an improvement in the pulmonary function. However, further clinical research is necessary to confirm their efficacy and establish safe dosage recommendations in COPD treatment.",

The phase 3 ROMAN trial showed avasopasem manganese (AVA) significantly decreased individual endpoints of incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis (SOM, World Health Organization [WHO] grade 3-4), with nominal decrease in severity (WHO grade 4) and significant increase in the delay in onset of SOM. We sought to determine the Net Treatment Benefit (NTB) of AVA versus placebo (PBO) using the generalized pairwise comparisons (GPC) method. METHODS AND MATERIALS: GPC is a statistical method that permits simultaneous analysis of several prioritized outcomes, comparing all possible pairs of a patient in the active (ie, AVA) group and a patient from the control (ie, PBO) group. NTB is the net benefit across all the outcomes for AVA compared to PBO. Key clinically relevant outcomes from ROMAN were prioritized: (1) WHO grade 4 OM incidence; (2) SOM incidence; (3) days of SOM; (4) days to SOM onset, with 7 days difference defined as the clinical relevance threshold for SOM days and SOM onset. RESULTS: GPC analysis of 407 patients (AVA = 241, placebo = 166) stratified by cisplatin schedule and treatment setting resulted in 13,969 pairwise comparisons. AVA showed statistically significant net benefit on all 4 key outcomes with a 53.9% probability that AVA would benefit patients versus a 35.0% probability that PBO would; the difference between these probabilities was a NTB of 18.9% (P = .0012), translating to an AVA number needed to treat of 5.3 patients. All outcomes contributed to NTB, reflecting improvements in SOM incidence, onset and duration, and in grade 4 OM incidence seen in the original ROMAN analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This GPC analysis shows compelling evidence from the ROMAN trial of AVA's clinical benefit across key parameters of SOM burden."

However, little is known about the processes involved in long-distance transport of Mn in hyperaccumulators. In this study, synchrotron-based micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) imaging showed that root tips and root hairs may be the focal sites for root uptake of Mn. Furthermore, the high Mn intensity in the vascular bundles (xylem and phloem) of stems and petioles indicates that the xylem and phloem play crucial roles in Mn transport from roots to leaves. High concentrations of Mn and three organic acids (oxalic, citric, and malic) were detected in the xylem sap under Mn treatment, and Mn may be chelated with them in the xylem for transport from the root to the shoot. Additionally, rooting and leaf-sourcing experiments confirmed that accumulated Mn in mature leaves could be re-transported via the phloem. However, the majority of Mn exported from mature leaves was translocated upward to the shoots (approximately 96 %), and only 4 % was translocated to the roots. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of long-distance transport of Mn in plants.",

MnS@PAA nanoparticles of varying sizes were synthesized by altering the ratio of ethylene glycol (EG) to diethylene glycol (DEG) during the synthesis process. These nanoparticles exhibited a uniform size distribution and demonstrated high T1 relaxation rates, along with a notable pH-responsive behavior. As the nanoparticle size increased, the T1 relaxation rate decreased, indicating that size plays a crucial role in their MRI performance. Additionally, research has revealed that the efficiency of tumor uptake by these nanoparticles is size dependent. Specifically, MnS@PAA nanoparticles with a core size of 100 nm (MS100) exhibited greater tumor accumulation and provided enhanced MRI contrast. Once within the acidic environment of a tumor, MS100 decomposes into Mn2+ and H2S. Mn2+ ions promote the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which leads to lipid peroxidation and induces ferroptosis. Concurrently, the release of H2S inhibits catalase activity, resulting in elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), achieving a synergistic effect between chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and gas therapy. This study explores the influence of nanoparticle size on its potential applications as an MRI contrast agent and as a therapeutic agent in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Antimony (Sb) is a toxic heavy metal that endangers both the environment and human health. In response to the growing need for efficient Sb removal from printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW), this study introduces a novel titanium-manganese binary oxide adsorbent (T2M1BO) synthesized via precipitation. Experimental results show that T2M1BO exhibited higher absorption efficiency for Sb(III) compared to Sb(V), with maximum adsorption capacities recorded at 323.19 mg/g for Sb(III) and 273.65 mg/g for Sb(V) at pH 5. The findings emphasize the synergistic interaction between titanium and manganese oxides, which enhances the adsorption of antimony. Adsorption followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, consistent with the Freundlich isotherm model. While Sb(V) adsorption involved surface metal hydroxyl group replacement and inner-sphere complex formation, Sb(III) removal required a more complex approach, incorporating adsorption and oxidation processes. The straightforward synthesis, high efficiency, and recyclability of T2M1BO position it as a cpromising candidate for antimony removal in recyclability wastewater treatment.",

      "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an essential and important metal; however, overexposures lead to adverse neurological outcomes. Nonoccupational Mn overexposure occurs primarily through consumption of Mn-contaminated drinking water (DW). Sex differences in terms of nervous and immune systems' responsiveness to excessive Mn in the DW are understudied. Thus, this study investigated behavioral and sex differences in response to Mn DW treatment (0.4 g Mn/L for up to 8 weeks) and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge of adult C57BL/6 mice with GFP-tagged monocytes/microglia. After 6 weeks, in motor function tests, Mn exposure resulted in decreased activity and gait deficits. In two different mood tests (open field test [OFT]/elevated zero maze), Mn-exposed mice exhibited decreased fear/anxiety-like behavior. Two weeks after behavioral assessment, when mice were challenged with LPS, circulating inflammatory cytokines, and acute phase proteins increased in both sexes. After 8 weeks of Mn exposure, liver and brain Mn levels were increased, but Mn alone did not affect circulating cytokines in either sex. Notably, Mn-exposed/LPS-challenged males had potentiated plasma cytokine output, whereas the reverse was seen in females. Males, but not females, continued to exhibit increased fearlessness (i.e., increased OFT center time), even when challenged with LPS. Overall, our results show that Mn DW exposure increases brain Mn levels and it leads to behavioral alterations in both sexes. However, males might be more susceptible to the effect of Mn on mood, and this effect is recalcitrant to an inflammagen challenge. Mn augmented post-LPS cytokine production only in males, further indicating that important Mn effects are sex-biased.",

Each tested 12 treatments in a 2 × 6 factorial arrangement with 3,360 Ross 308 males (35 birds/pen, 8 pens/treatment) in a randomized complete block design. Phytase levels comprised no PhyG or PhyG at 2,000, 1,500 and 1,000 FTU/kg during 0 to 10, 10 to 20 and (Experiment 2) 20 to 35 d of age, respectively; TM diets comprised: no added TM (diet 1); 10, 15, 3 and 10, or 20, 30, 6 and 20 mg/kg of Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn as sulphate (diets 2 and 3); 15, 3 and 10 mg/kg of Zn, Cu and Mn as oxide and 15 mg/kg Fe as sulphate, or 30, 6 and 20 mg/kg of Zn, Cu and Mn as oxide and 30 mg/kg Fe as sulphate (diets 4 and 5), and; 10, 3, 15 and 10 mg/kg of organic Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn (diet 6). Apart from no added TM, basal diets were nutritionally adequate; phytase-supplemented diets were reduced in Ca and retainable P. All diets were pelleted and fed ad libitum. In both experiments during all phases there were interactions (P < 0.05) between phytase and TM on BW, BW gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), FCR (experiment 2 only) and tibia Zn. Without phytase, TM improved (P < 0.05) these measures. Phytase without TM increased (P < 0.05) d 35 BW, overall BWG and FI, equivalent to or beyond the level achieved by TM without phytase. Tibia Zn at d 10 and 20 in Experiment 2 was increased by phytase beyond the level achieved by TM without phytase (P < 0.05). Phytase also increased (P < 0.05) liver Zn, Fe, and Mn at d 10 and 20 and plasma Zn at d 20 d. There was no consistent effect of TM source or dose on bird responses. In conclusion, PhyG phytase replaced the effect of added TM on performance during 0 to 35 d of age and could support a reduction in commercial dose levels of added TM in all-vegetable broiler diets.",

Gemcitabine, a cytosine nucleoside analog, is widely used for various solid tumors; however, its effectiveness is often limited by drug resistance and adverse side effects. In this study, we developed a novel drug delivery system, Mn/Se-Gem, designed to target tumor cells overexpressing CD44 and facilitate the controlled release of gemcitabine. This system exploits gemcitabine's pH sensitivity and HA-mediated CD44 targeting to induce DNA damage. Simultaneously, it neutralizes the acidic tumor microenvironment and releases nano-selenium and manganese ions, which promote the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to mitochondrial damage and enhanced apoptosis of cancer cells. Furthermore, Mn (II) activates the cGAS-STING pathway, increasing susceptibility to ROS-induced DNA double-strand breaks, promoting macrophage maturation, inhibiting M2 polarization, and enhancing the cytotoxic function of T lymphocytes against tumor cells. In summary, this combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy presents a promising strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Elevated concentrations of manganese (Mn2+) and zinc (Zn2+) in water bodies can disrupt ecosystems and damage aquatic life. However, the mechanisms underlying the removal of Mn2+ and Zn2+ under dynamic conditions and the optimal hydraulic retention time (HRT) for passive treatment plants remain unclear. Here, a pilot-scale passive treatment system for the removal of Mn2+ and Zn2+ from legacy mine drainage in northern Japan is proposed; it was performed at circumneutral pH for 152 days. Comprehensive suspended solid mineralogy analyses and geochemical and numerical modelling were conducted to optimise the passive treatment efficiency. Mn2+ removal (efficiency reaching 98 %) primarily depended on the activity of Mn-oxidising bacteria. Zn2+ removal involved Zn2+ co-precipitation with birnessite combined with adsorption or ion exchange on the birnessite surface. The inverse numerical model successfully determined the Mn2+ oxidation rate constant, Zn mass transfer coefficient, and Zn distribution coefficient. Under dynamic conditions, HRT emerged as a key factor underlying the pilot-scale passive treatment efficiency. An HRT of 0.5 days led to optimal Mn2+ and Zn2+ removal conditions and achieved values lower than the Japanese national effluent limit. The findings provide crucial information for passive treatment strategy development and environmental management, especially when considering real-scale implementation."

      "abstract": "Crucial environmental and health problems occur in acidic paddy fields contaminated by cadmium （Cd）. Alkaline stabilizers and manganese （Mn） fertilizers are often applied to soil to reduce Cd pollution in rice. However, the bioavailability of Mn may also be affected by stabilizers and cannot effectively reduce Cd accumulation in rice. In this study, an alkaline compound stabilizer containing organic matter and silica-calcium was used in combination with a soil application of Mn antagonist （Mn-sulfate）, and organic Mn-fertilizer （EDTA-Mn, amino acid-bound Mn） was sprayed on the leaves of rice at the booting stage and filling stage to elucidate the effectiveness and mechanism of the combined treatments. In the pot experiment, three types of treatments were selected： soil application of stabilizer/Mn fertilizer （T）, Mn foliar spray （Y）, and the combination of soil stabilizer/Mn fertilizer and Mn foliar spray （T+Y）, and a total of 12 treatments were performed. In the field experiment, two types of treatments were selected： Mn foliar spray （Y） and the combination of soil stabilizer/Mn fertilizer and Mn foliar spray （T+Y）, and nine treatments were performed in total. The pot experiment results showed that, compared with that in CK, the Cd content in brown rice treated with the single applications of stabilizer, Mn-sulfate, and 1/2 stabilizer+1/2 Mn-sulfate were decreased by 19.1%, 44.0%, and 51.9%, respectively. On the basis of 1/2 stabilizer+1/2 Mn-sulfate, the Mn foliar spray of EDTA-Mn and amino acid-bound Mn further reduced Cd in brown rice by 46.1% and 46.9%, respectively. Field experiment results showed that, compared with that in CK, Mn foliar spray with EDTA-Mn and amino acid-bound Mn combined with 1/2 stabilizer + 1/2 Mn-sulfate reduced Cd in brown rice by 86.9% and 83.6%, respectively, and the Cd bioconcentration factor were both reduced to 0.05. A single application of stabilizer significantly increased the pH of the soil in the pot experiment and reduced the soil CaCl2-extractable Cd. However, the single application of stabilizer significantly inhibited the formation of Mn plaque on the root surface, while 1/2 stabilizer+1/2 Mn sulfate significantly increased the iron-Mn plaque on the root surface, and more Cd was also fixed on root surface. The addition of Mn foliar spray significantly reduced Cd transport from the stem and leaves to the rice grains. The field experiment showed that the 1/2 stabilizer+1/2 Mn-sulfate combined with Mn foliar spray significantly reduced Cd transport from the stem and leaves to the rice grains, though this combined treatment did not increase soil pH and reduce CaCl2-Cd as much as the treatment of the full dose of stabilizer. In summary, pot and field experiments consistently showed that 1/2 stabilizer+1/2 Mn-sulfate combined with organic Mn foliar spray could inhibit the uptake and transport of Cd in whole soil-plant systems and effectively reduce the Cd accumulation in brown rice.",

Carbon dots (CDs) nanozymes are excellent candidate materials with both diagnostic and therapeutic potential. However, CDs nanozymes with both ultra-high relaxation rate and good therapeutic effect are still to be developed. Herein, novel carbon dots (MPC-CDs) were synthesized from polyethyleneimine (PEI), the photosensitizer hexahydroporphyrin (Ce6) and manganese. The Ce6 enabled the MPC-CDs to exhibit excellent PDT therapeutic ability, with a singlet oxygen yield as high as 1.52. The doping of the metal manganese gave the complexes CAT-like activity, and the singlet oxygen rate was further increased in the presence of H2O2, up to 1.97. In addition, manganese endowed the CDs with better MRI capabilities, and the r1 and r2 relaxation rates were significantly improved by 7.8-fold and 4.6-fold under acidic and H2O2 conditions. The in vitro and in vivo results showed that MPC-CDs could achieve TME-responsive MR imaging and synergistic anti-tumor effects, providing an effective strategy to further enhance the effectiveness of tumor diagnosis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "The advent of precision medicine in oncology emphasizes the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies that effectively integrate diagnosis and treatment while minimizing invasiveness. Manganese oxide nanomaterials (MONs) have emerged as a promising class of nanocarriers in biomedicine, particularly for targeted drug delivery and the therapeutic management of tumors. These nanomaterials are characterized by exceptional responsiveness to the tumor microenvironment (TME), high catalytic efficiency, favorable biodegradability, and advanced capabilities in magnetic resonance imaging. These attributes significantly enhance drug delivery, facilitate real-time bioimaging, and enable early tumor detection, thereby improving the precision and effectiveness of cancer therapies. This review highlights the significant advancements in the synthesis and therapeutic applications of MONs, beginning with a comprehensive overview of key synthetic methods, including thermal decomposition, potassium permanganate reduction, exfoliation, adsorption-oxidation, and hydro/solvothermal techniques. We delve into the preparation of MONs and H-MnO₂-based nanomaterials, emphasizing their chemical properties, surface modifications, and toxicity profiles, which are critical for their clinical application. Moreover, we discuss the notable applications of H-MnO₂-based nanomaterials in pH-responsive drug release, overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR), immunotherapy, and the development of nanovaccines for synergistic cancer treatments. By addressing the current challenges in the clinical translation of MONs, we propose future research directions for overcoming these obstacles. By underscoring the potential of MONs to transform cancer treatment paradigms, this review aims to inspire further investigations into their multifunctional applications in oncology, thus ultimately contributing to more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies."

      "abstract": "Bleomycin (BLM) is a natural product with established anticancer activity, attributed to its ability to cleave intracellular DNA. BLM complexes with iron (BLM-Fe3+) exhibit peroxidase-like activity, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cause DNA cleavage. Inspired by the mechanism of BLM, we synthesized a novel conjugate of manganese tetraphenylporphyrin (MnTPP) with a biomimetic peptoid (i.e., oligo-N-substituted glycines); this conjugate harnesses the oxidative capabilities of manganese porphyrins combined with the cell-penetrating ability of a previously reported mitochondria-targeting peptoid (MTP). UV-vis spectroscopy showed the formation of Mn(V)-oxo porphyrin, a potent oxidative species, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, simulating metallobleomycin reactivity. Biological assays demonstrated that MnTPP-MTP significantly boosted ROS production and induced cytotoxicity toward cancer cells, while sparing normal fibroblasts. Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) assay revealed reversible, dose-dependent impairment of the mitochondrial membrane potential by MnTPP-MTP treatment. DNA cleavage assays showed that MnTPP-MTP, specifically in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, could elicit substantial DNA damage, in a similar way to BLM. In vivo studies using liposome-encapsulated MnTPP-MTP (lipo-peptoid) indicated superior tumor suppression, without systemic toxicity, when administered locally. Immunofluorescence staining for Ki67 and TUNEL confirmed reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, respectively, validating the anticancer efficacy of lipo-peptoid. These results suggest that MnTPP-MTP, particularly in a liposomal formulation, is a promising new chemotherapeutic agent with robust oxidative mechanisms, poised for further development and application against diverse cancers.",

Additionally, RT administered at different doses can induce varying degrees of radioimmunotherapy. High doses of radiation (>10 Gy) may result in immune suppression, while moderate doses (4-10 Gy), although capable of mitigating the immune suppression caused by high-dose radiation, are often insufficient in effectively killing tumor cells. Therefore, enhancing the generation of ROS and ameliorating the tumor hypoxic immune-suppressive microenvironment at moderate radiation doses could potentially drive radiation-induced immune responses, offering a fundamental solution to the limitations of RT. In this study, a novel multifunctional nanoplatform, RMLF, integrating a Ru (II) complex into folate-functionalized liposomes with BSA-MnO2 nanoparticles was proposed. Orthogonal experimental optimization enhances radiosensitization via increasing accumulation in cancer cells, elevating ROS, and contributing to a dual enhancement of the cGAS-STING-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway, aimed to overcome the insufficient DAMPs typically seen in the conventional RT at 4 Gy. Such a strategy effectively activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes for infiltration into tumor tissues and promoted the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to M1 phenotype, substantially bolstering immune memory responses. This pioneering approach represents the first use of a ruthenium complex in radioimmunotherapy, activating the cGAS-STING pathway to amplify immune responses, overcome RT resistance, and extend immunotherapeutic potential.",
