      "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BC) ranks as the tenth most common malignancy worldwide, with high recurrence and progression rates despite current treatments. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP2, play critical roles in tumor invasion and metastasis, contributing to poor prognosis. The p53-induced long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) lincRNA-p21, which acts as a tumor suppressor, has been implicated in various cancers, but its role in BC remains unclear. Sesamin, a bioactive lignan derived from sesame oil, has shown promise as a chemopreventive agent with multiple antitumor effects. In this study, sesamin was found to significantly inhibit cell viability in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Additionally, sesamin inhibits MMP2 expression by downregulating the STAT3 signaling pathway, leading to reduced tumor cell migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. LincRNA-p21 was identified as a crucial mediator in this process, helping sesamin reduce STAT3 activity. Co-administration of a PARP inhibitor with sesamin further enhanced the sensitivity of BC cells to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, mitomycin-c), suggesting its potential as an adjuvant therapy. These findings highlight the potential of sesamin as a therapeutic agent, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with conventional chemotherapy, to reduce tumor progression and chemotherapy-related toxicity in BC patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute mesenteric artery ischemia is recognized as a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, with its incidence increasing with age. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of sesamin in mitigating the histological, immunological, and biochemical damage associated with superior mesenteric artery ischemia and reperfusion (SMA I/R) injury in the ileum. METHODS: Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four equal groups. Group I (Control group): Received no treatment. Group II (SMA I/R group): Carboxymethylcellulose was mixed with distilled water and administered orally via gavage at a dose of 1 mL/kg/dose for three weeks. At the end of the third week, SMA ischemia was induced for 60 minutes followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. Group III (Sesamin group): Received sesamin orally at a dose of 30 mg/kg via gavage for three weeks. Group IV (Sesamin + SMA I/R group): Received sesamin followed by SMA I/R. RESULTS: Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were highest in the SMA I/R group, while lower levels were observed in the Sesamin + SMA I/R group (p<0.05). Similarly, total oxidant status (TOS) was significantly reduced in the Sesamin + SMA I/R group compared to the SMA I/R group (p<0.05). Consistent with these findings, Bax expression, a pro-apoptotic marker, was less intense in the Sesamin + SMA I/R group than in the SMA I/R group. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the administration of sesamin prior to SMA I/R effectively reduces oxidative damage and prevents histological alterations, as demonstrated by histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical parameters.",

      "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is a common solid malignancy in children and adolescents. Despite a success of standard therapeutic approaches, an effective therapeutic strategy is in a great need for improved outcomes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effect of sesamin and its influence on NKG2D ligand expression in human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells and to compare the differences in NK cell elimination efficiency before and after treatment. Cell viability of MG-63 cells treated with serial concentrations of sesamin (0-100 µM) was measured using MTT. Induction of cell cycle arrest was determined with flow cytometry. Flow cytometry and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR were employed to detect the changes of protein and mRNA level of NKG2D ligands before and after treatment with sesamin. NK cell elimination assay was performed to determine the changes in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against MG-63 cells treated with sesamin. Sesamin induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in MG-63 cells with increased p21 expression. Expression of MICA, MICB and ULBP1 at the protein and mRNA level were significantly increased (P<0.05). MG-63 cells treated with sesamin were more susceptible to NK cell-mediated elimination (P<0.05). Enhanced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was correlated with expression of NKG2D ligands (P<0.05). In conclusion, sesamin can induce cell cycle arrest and upregulate the expression of NKG2D ligands in MG-63 cells, thereby enhancing NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against osteosarcoma cells."

      "abstract": "AIMS: The aim of this study was to identify sesamin as a Casein hydrolase P (ClpP) inhibitor and to determine whether it could attenuate the virulence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Through fluorescence resonance energy transfer screening, a natural compound sesamin demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on ClpP enzyme activity with an IC50 of 20.62 μg/ml. Sesamin suppressed the expression of virulence factors of MRSA such as α-hemolysin (Hla) and Panton-Valentine leucocidin by protein immunoblotting. Thermal shift assay and cellular thermal shift assay showed that sesamin could bind to ClpP and enhance the thermal stability of ClpP. Furthermore, the binding affinity between sesamin and ClpP was determined by surface plasmon resonance with a KD value of 7.18 × 10-6 M. Molecular docking, dynamics simulations and point mutation analysis confirmed the stability of the sesamin-ClpP complex with a -10.184 kcal/mol total binding energy and identified PHE-174 in ClpP as a key binding site. In mice pneumonia model, sesamin combined vancomycin treatment markedly reduced the pathogenicity of MRSA-infected mice, offering protection against fatal lung infections. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings validate sesamin as a promising compound that targets ClpP, reducing virulence factor expression, that holds potential as a hit compound against MRSA infections.",

      "abstract": "Food allergens are the key triggers of allergic diarrhea, causing damage to the immune-rich ileum. This weakens the mucosal barrier and tight junctions, increases intestinal permeability, and exacerbates allergen exposure, thereby worsening the condition. Sesamin, a natural lignan isolated from sesame seed, has shown potential in regulating immune responses, but its effects on intestinal health remain unclear. In this study, we constructed an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic diarrhea mouse model, which demonstrated increased mast cell degranulation, reduced tight junction integrity, and impaired intestinal barrier function. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in the ileum, along with unbalanced cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T-cell immunity, altered gut microbiota composition, and disrupted bacterial metabolism. Sesamin treatment significantly alleviated intestinal damage by modulating gut microbiota abundance, enhancing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and increasing SCFA receptor expression. This study suggests that sesamin may be a promising therapeutic candidate for allergic diarrhea and intestinal injury.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic disease seriously threatening human health, with limited treatment means, however. Sesamin, a common lignan in sesame seed oil, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Our previous studies have shown an ameliorative effect of sesamin on lipid accumulation in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HePG2) induced by oleic acid, with its protective effects unclear in the case of 9-trans-C18:1 elaidic acid (9-trans-C18,1). METHODS: L02 cells, an important tool in scientific researches due to its high proliferation ability, preserved hepatocyte function, and specificity in response to exogenous factors, were incubated with 9-trans-C18:1 to establish an in vitro model of NAFLD in our study. The lipid accumulation in cells and the morphology of mitochondria and autolysosomes were observed by Oil Red O staining and transmission electron microscopy. The effects of sesamin on oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial function, autophagy as well as related protein levels in L02 cells were also investigated in the presence of 9-trans-C18:1. RESULTS: The results showed that sesamin significantly accelerated the autophagy flux of L02 cells induced by 9-trans-C18:1 as well as elevated protein levels of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and its downstream target lysosome-associated membrane protein 1(LAMP1), along with up-regulated levels of TFEB and LAMP1 in the nucleus indicated by Immunofluorescence. In addition, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 and Parkin mediated mitophagy was activated by sesamin. The direct inhibitor Eltrombopag and indirect inhibitor MHY1485 of TFEB reversed the protective effect of sesamin, suggesting the involvement of autophagy in the lipid-lowering process of sesamin. DISCUSSION: This work suggests that sesamin regulates autophagy through TFEB to alleviate lipid accumulation in L02 cells induced by 9-trans-C18:1, providing a potential target for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is known to be associated with cardiovascular diseases. Sesamin (Ses) is a natural phenolic compound found in sesame seeds and sesame oil. Ferroptosis is a novel mode of cell death characterised by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This study aims to explore whether PM2.5 can induce ferroptosis in H9C2 cells and to investigate the precise protective mechanism of Ses. METHODS: Based on transcriptomic data, PM2.5 may induce ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. The ferroptosis inducer erastin and ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) were used to illustrate the mechanisms involved in PM2.5-induced H9C2 cell injury. Using network pharmacology, the pharmacological mechanism and potential therapy targets of Ses were explored for the treatment of PM2.5-induced cardiomyocyte injury. H9C2 cells were cultured and pretreated with Fer-1 or different concentrations of Ses, and then cardiomyocyte injury model was established using erastin or PM2.5. Indicators of oxidative responses, including total superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and malondialdehyde, were measured. The expression levels of ferroptosis-related proteins were determined through Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Results demonstrate that PM2.5 induces ferroptosis in H9C2 cells and Ses exerts a protective effect by suppressing ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis. DISCUSSION: Overall, these findings elucidate a novel mechanism by which Ses ameliorates the detrimental effects of PM2.5 on cardiomyocytes."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The present study investigated the nephron-testicular protective effects of sesamin against cisplatin (CP)-induced acute renal and testicular injuries. METHODS: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were allocated to receive carboxymethylcellulose (0.5%, as sesamin vehicle), CP (a single i.p. 5 mg/kg dose), CP plus sesamin at 10 or 20 mg/kg orally for 10 days. RESULTS: Data analysis showed significant increases in serum urea, creatinine, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as renal and testicular tissue malondialdehyde and nitric-oxide concentrations in CP-intoxicated rats in comparison to control animals. On the contrary, rats treated with CP only exhibited significantly lower (p < .05) serum testosterone, tissue glutathione, and activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes compared to control rats. Histopathologically examining CP-intoxicated rats' tissues using H&E and PAS stains showed atrophied glomeruli, interstitial inflammatory cells, atypic tubular epithelium with focal apoptosis, and reduced mucopolysaccharide content. Further, immunohistochemical staining of the same group revealed an increase in p53 and cyclooxygenase-II (Cox-II) expression in renal and testicular tissues. Treatment with sesamin alleviated almost all the changes mentioned above in a dose-dependent manner, with the 20 mg/kg dose restoring several parameters' concentrations to normal ranges. CONCLUSIONS: In brief, sesamin could protect the kidneys and testes against CP toxicity through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects.",

Sesamin (Ses), a functional lignan isolated from Sesamum indicum, possesses hypolipidemic, liver-protective, anti-hypertensive, and anti-tumor properties. Ses has been found to improve hepatic steatosis, but the exact mechanisms through which Ses achieves this are not well understood. In this study, we observed the anti-hepatic steatosis effects of Ses in palmitate/oleate (PA/OA)-incubated primary mouse hepatocytes, AML12 hepatocytes, and HepG2 cells, as well as in high-fat, high-cholesterol diet-induced NASH mice. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), a free fatty acid (FA) transport protein, was involved in the Ses-mediated inhibition of hepatic fat accumulation. Moreover, the overexpression of CD36 significantly increased hepatic steatosis in both Ses-treated PA/OA-incubated HepG2 cells and NASH mice. Furthermore, Ses treatment suppressed insulin-induced de novo lipogenesis in HepG2 cells, which was reversed by CD36 overexpression. Mechanistically, we found that Ses ameliorated NASH by inhibiting CD36-mediated FA uptake and upregulation of lipogenic genes, including FA synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1. The findings of our study provide novel insights into the potential therapeutic applications of Ses in the treatment of NASH.",

Furthermore, treatment with phorbol myristate acetate, a protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) agonist, increased PKCδ phosphorylation and attenuated the protective effects of Ses against pyroptosis in PA-treated mouse primary hepatocytes. Mechanistically, Ses treatment alleviated hepatocyte pyroptosis in NASH, which was associated with the regulation of the PKCδ/nod-like receptor family CARD domain-containing protein 4/caspase-1 axis. This study introduces a novel concept and target, suggesting the potential use of functional factors in food to alleviate liver damage caused by NASH."

      "abstract": "Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) is a prevalent clinical spinal disease characterized by the calcification and degeneration of the cartilage endplate (CEP), which significantly reduces nutrient supply to the intervertebral disc. Traditional Chinese medicine offers a conservative and effective approach for treating LDD. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of Sesamin in LDD treatment. Transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the effect of Sesamin on LPS-induced ATDC5. We explored the role of BECN2, a target gene of Sesamin, in attenuating LPS-induced degeneration of ATDC5 cells. Our results revealed the identification of 117 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 54 up-regulated and 63 down-regulated genes. Notably, Sesamin significantly increased the expression of BECN2 in LPS-induced ATDC5 cell degeneration. Overexpressed BECN2 enhanced cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis in LPS-induced ATDC5 cells, while BECN2 knockdown reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, BECN2 played a crucial role in attenuating chondrocyte degeneration by modulating autophagy and inflammation. Specifically, BECN2 suppressed autophagy by reducing the expression of ATG14, VPS34, and GASP1, and alleviated the inflammatory response by decreasing the expression of inflammasome proteins NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRP1, and AIM2. In vivo experiments further supported the beneficial effects of Sesamin in mitigating LDD. This study provides novel insights into the potential molecular mechanism of Sesamin in treating LDD, highlighting its ability to mediate autophagy and inflammation inhibition via targeting the BECN2. This study provides a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of LDD, as well as a potential molecular target for LDD.",

      "abstract": "Lead (Pb) is a well-known toxic pollutant that has negative effects on behavioral functions. Sesamin, a phytonutrient of the lignan class, has shown neuroprotective effects in various neurological disorder models. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the putative protective effects of sesamin against Pb-induced behavioral deficits and to identify the role of oxidative stress in male rats. The rats were exposed to 500 ppm of Pb acetate in their drinking water and simultaneously treated orally with sesamin at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day for eight consecutive weeks. Standard behavioral paradigms were used to assess the behavioral functions of the animals during the eighth week of the study. Subsequently, oxidative stress factors were evaluated in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampal regions of the rats. The results of this study showed that Pb exposure triggered anxiety-/depression-like behaviors and impaired object recognition memory, but locomotor activity was indistinguishable from the normal control rats. These behavioral deficiencies were associated with suppressed enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels, and enhanced lipid peroxidation in the investigated brain regions. Notably, correlations were detected between behavioral deficits and oxidative stress generation in the Pb-exposed rats. Interestingly, sesamin treatment mitigated anxio-depressive-like behaviors, ameliorated object recognition memory impairment, and modulated oxidative-antioxidative status in the rats exposed to Pb. The results suggest that the anti-oxidative properties of sesamin may be one of the underlying mechanisms behind its beneficial effect in ameliorating behavioral deficits associated with Pb exposure.",

      "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent integral to specific cancer chemotherapy protocols, is often curtailed in application owing to its significant hepatotoxic side effects. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the hepatoprotective potential of sesamin, a plant-originated antioxidant, using rat models. The rats were divided into five groups: a control group received only the vehicle for six days; a cyclophosphamide group received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) single injection of cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg) on day four; a sesamin group received a daily high oral dose (20 mg/kg) of sesamin for six days; and two groups were pretreated with oral sesamin (10 and 20 mg/kg daily from day one to day six) followed by an i.p. injection of cyclophosphamide on day four. The final and last sesamin dose was administered 24 h before euthanasia. At the end of the experiment, blood and liver tissue were collected for biochemical and histopathological assessments. The results indicated significantly increased liver markers (AST, ALT, ALP, and BIL), cytokines (TNFα and IL-1β), caspase-3, and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the cyclophosphamide group as compared to the normal control. Additionally, there was a significant decline in antioxidants (GSH) and antioxidant enzymes (CAT and SOD), but the sesamin treatment reduced liver marker enzymes, cytokines, and caspase-3 and improved antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes. Thus, sesamin effectively countered these alterations and helped to normalize the histopathological alterations. In conclusion, sesamin demonstrated the potential for attenuating cyclophosphamide-induced hepatotoxicity by modulating cytokine networks, apoptotic pathways, and oxidative stress, suggesting its potential role as an adjunct in chemotherapy to reduce hepatotoxicity."

These factors are known to play an important role in osteolysis as well as potential targets for the treatment of osteolysis. Sesamin has been shown to have a variety of biological functions, such as inhibiting inflammation, anti-tumour and involvement in the regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. However, the therapeutic effect of sesamin on osteolysis and its mechanism remain unclear. Present studies shown that in the condition of in vitro, sesamin could inhibit osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, as well as suppressing the expression of osteoclast-specific genes. Further studies on the mechanism suggest that the effect of sesamin on human osteoclasts was mediated by blocking the ERK and NF-κB signalling pathways. Besides, sesamin was found to be effective in treating LPS-induced osteolysis by decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Sesamin was non-toxic to heart, liver, kidney, lung and spleen. Therefore, sesamin is a promising phytochemical agent for the therapy of osteolysis-related diseases caused by inflammation and excessive osteoclast activation.",

The increasing prevalence of diabetes poses a tremendous socioeconomic burden worldwide, resulting in the rise of many studies on Chinese herbal medicines to discover the most effective cure for diabetes. Sesame seeds are among these Chinese herbal medicines that were found to contain various pharmacological activities, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, lowering cholesterol, improving liver function, blood pressure and sugar lowering, regulating lipid synthesis, and anticancer activities. These medicinal benefits are attributed to sesamin, which is the main lignan found in sesame seeds and oil. In this study, Wistar rat models were induced with type 2 diabetes using streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide, and the effect of sesamin on the changes in body weight, blood sugar level, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin levels, and the states of the pancreas and liver of the rats were evaluated. The results indicate a reduced blood glucose level, HbA1c, TG, and ALT and AST enzymes after sesamin treatment, while increased insulin level, SOD, CAT, and GPx activities were also observed. These findings prove sesamin's efficacy in ameliorating the symptoms of diabetes through its potent pharmacological activities.",

However, the effects of sesamin on thyroid endocrine function in zebrafish exposed to fluoride have not been clarified. This study was designed to investigate the alleviating effects of sesamin on thyroid endocrine disruption in zebrafish induced by fluoride. The results showed that sesamin significantly improved growth performance in adults exposed to fluoride; decreased significantly the mortality rate, increased remarkably the hatching rate and body length, and alleviated the phenomenon of spinal curvature, yolk cyst and pericardial cyst to varying degrees in fluoride-exposed embryos and larvae. Sesamin alleviated remarkably the damage of thyroid tissues in fluoride-exposed adults. Moreover, sesamin obviously reduced oxidative stress and improved the imbalance of thyroid hormones in fluoride-exposed adults or larvae. In addition, sesamin reversed the expression of endocrine-related genes of thyroid in fluoride-exposed adults or larvae. This indicates that sesamin can affects the thyroid tissue structure, hormone levels, and the expression of endocrine-related genes of thyroid, thus alleviating the thyroid endocrine disorder induced by fluoride and improving the growth and development. This study also demonstrates that sesamin can be a promising novel treatment for thyroid endocrine disorder caused by fluoride.",

Myocardial hypertrophy is an adaptive response by myocardial cells to stress after cardiac injury to maintain cardiac output and function. Angiotensin II (Ang-II) regulates CVD through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and its signaling in cardiac myocytes leads to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Sesamin (SA), a natural compound in sesame seeds, has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. This study investigated whether SA could attenuate hypertrophic damage and oxidative injuries in H9c2 cells under Ang-II stimulation. We found that SA decreased the cell surface area. Furthermore, Ang-II treatment reduced Ang-II-increased ANP, BNP, and β-MHC expression. Ang-II enhanced NADPH oxidase activity, ROS formation, and decreased Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity. SA treatment reduces Ang-II-caused oxidative injuries. We also found that SA mitigates Ang-II-induced apoptosis and pro-inflammatory responses. In conclusion, SA could attenuate Ang-II-induced cardiac hypertrophic injuries by inhibiting oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation in H9c2 cells. Therefore, SA might be a potential supplement for CVD management.",

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence induces inflammation and is now considered one of the causes of organismal aging. Accumulating evidence indicates that age-related deterioration of mitochondrial function leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage, which in turn causes cellular senescence. Thus, it is important to maintain mitochondrial function and suppress oxidative stress in order to inhibit the accumulation of senescent cells. Sesamin and its isomer episesamin are types of lignans found in sesame oil, and after being metabolized in the liver, their metabolites have been reported to exhibit antioxidant properties. However, their effects on cellular senescence remain unknown. In this study, the effects of sesamin, episesamin, and their metabolites SC1 and EC1-2 on replicative senescence were evaluated using human diploid lung fibroblasts, and TIG-3 cells. The results showed that sesamin and episesamin treatment had no effect on proliferative capacity compared to the untreated late passage group, whereas SC1 and EC1-2 treatment improved proliferative capacity and mitigated DNA damage of TIG-3 cells. Furthermore, other cellular senescence markers, such as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), mitochondria-derived ROS, and mitochondrial function (ROS/ATP ratio) were also reduced by SC1 and EC1-2 treatment. These results suggest that SC1 and EC1-2 can maintain proper mitochondrial function and suppress the induction of cellular senescence.",

After the treatment period, the animals were positioned in a stereotaxic device for surgery and field potential recording. The population spike (PS) amplitude and slope of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) were evaluated in the DG region. Serum oxidative stress biomarkers (total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC)) were measured. Aβ impaired LTP induction at the PP-DG synapses evidenced by a decrease in EPSP slope and PS amplitude of LTP. In Aβ rats, Ses increased EPSP slope and PS amplitude of LTP in the DG granular cells. Also, an increase in TOS and a reduction in TAC caused by Aβ were significantly corrected by Ses. Ses could prevent Aβ-induced LTP impairment at the PP-DG synapses in male rats, which can be due to its preventive effects on oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Acute lung injury (ALI) with high rates of morbidity is often accompanied by the apoptosis in the type I alveolar epithelial cells (ATIs). Thus, the transdifferentiation of type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATIIs) into ATIs is crucial for the maintenance of alveolar epithelial functions. We aimed to elucidate the role of sesamin in the transdifferentiation of ATIIs to ATIs and the involvement of the TRPV1/AKT pathway. METHODS: In vivo, the mouse model of ALI was simulated by intraperitoneal and intratracheal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. The protective effects of sesamin on ALI were investigated using the survival rate, lung/body weight ratio, histological analysis of lung with HE staining, and mRNA levels of inflammatory factors. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence detection of ATIs marker AQP5 were used to evaluate the protective effect of sesamin on ATIs. Western blot, EdU, and qPCR analyses were applied to detect changes in apoptosis, proliferation, and transdifferentiation markers of ATII A549 cell lines. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to detect the involvement and relationships between the sesamin receptors (ANXA1 and TRPV1) and the AKT pathway in transdifferentiation. RESULTS: Sesamin (200 mg/kg) significantly improved LPS-induced ALI and inhibited LPS-induced ATIs reduction. A low concentration of sesamin (20 μM) promoted the transdifferentiation of ATIIs to ATIs. Both ANXA1 and TRPV1 were involved in sesamin-promoted transdifferentiation, while the P-AKT (S473) level was down-regulated by TRPV1 siRNA. CONCLUSION: Sesamin may promote transdifferentiation of ATII to ATI to ultimately rescue ALI, with TRPV1/AKT pathway involved in this transdifferentiation. This study revealed a novel role of sesamin in promoting the transdifferentiation of ATIIs to ATIs, providing experimental supports for the potential targets of ALI therapy.",

      "abstract": "Sesamin, a major phytochemical in sesame seeds and oil, has been reported to have effects on physiological and pathological angiogenesis in several studies. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of sesamin's effect on angiogenesis are not understood well enough. This study aimed to investigate its effect on both physiological and pathological angiogenesis using the in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model and the in vitro human endothelial cell line, EA.hy926, model. Sesamin inhibited the VEGFA-induced pathological angiogenesis significantly, although no effect was seen on angiogenesis without induction. It reduced the formation of vascular branches in the VEGFA-treated CAMs and also the proliferation and migration of EA.hy926 endothelial cells induced by VEGFA. Sesamin impeded the VEGF-mediated activation of Src and FAK signaling proteins, which may be responsible for sesamin-mediated reduction of pathological angiogenesis. Moreover, the effect of sesamin on the expressions of angiogenesis-related genes was then investigated and it was found that both mRNA and protein expressions of Notch1, the key pathway in vascular development, induced by VEGFA, were significantly reduced by sesamin. Our results altogether suggested that sesamin, by inhibiting pathological angiogenesis, has the potential to be employed in the prevention or treatment of diseases with over-angiogenesis, such as cancers."

      "abstract": "This study explored the effects of sesamin on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). High-fat and high-fructose diet-fed mice supplemented with or without sesamin. The results suggested that sesamin-treated mice lost body weight and fat tissue weight, had lower levels of serum metabolic parameters, and insulin resistance was mitigated. Histological examinations showed that sesamin treatment mitigated the progression of hepatic steatosis, and inflammation. In addition, sesamin enhanced hepatic antioxidant capacity, and decreased the activations of hepatic c-jun N-terminal kinase, inhibitor of kappa B kinase α, and insulin receptor substrate 1 as well as hepatic interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels. Further experiments indicated that sesamin treatment downregulated GRP78 and phospho-inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) expression, and upregulated x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) expression in hepatic tissue. The aforementioned results suggest that sesamin alleviates obesity-associated NASH, which might be linked to the effect of sesamin on the regulation of the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress-IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Thus, sesamin may be a good food functional ingredient in the treatment of obesity-associated NASH.",

      "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide is an anticancer drug with a wide spectrum of clinical uses, but its typical side effects are multiple complications, including nephron toxicity. The possible molecular mechanism of the nephroprotective action of sesamin (SM) against cyclophosphamide (CP) induced renal toxicity was investigated in rats by understanding oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. In this study, rats were arbitrarily grouped into the following four groups: a normal control group (CNT); a CP-induced toxicity group; a treatment group with two doses of sesamin SM10 and SM20; a group with sesamin (SM20) alone. A single dose of CP (150 mg/kg body, i.p.) was administered on day 4 of the experiments, while treatment with SM was given orally for seven days from day 1. The group treated with SM showed a significant protective effect against CP-induced renal damage in rats. Treatment with SM significantly increased the antioxidant enzymes (GSH, CAT, and SOD) and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Thus, SM significantly overcame the elevated kidney function markers (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and uric acid) by attenuating oxidative stress. The SM also significantly reduced the elevated cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα) and caspase-3 in the treated group. Histopathological studies confirmed the protective effect of sesamin (SM) on CP-induced nephrotoxicity. In conclusion, the current findings support the nephroprotective effect of sesamin against CP-induced renal injury.",

Tumor angiogenesis plays a critical role in CRC metastasis, and hypoxia, which widely existed in the tumor mass, drives tumor angiogenesis. Sesamin, a phytochemical derived from sesame seeds, has been reported to inhibit tumor cell growth and metastasis, however, the role of sesamin in CRC angiogenesis and its underlying mechanism have not been investigated yet. Here, an in vitro tube formation assay and an in vivo angiogenesis assay were used to explore the role of sesamin in CRC angiogenesis. In this study, we found that sesamin significantly inhibited hypoxia-stimulated CRC angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, oral intake of sesamin dramatically suppressed neovessel formation of matrigel plugs with CRC cells in nude mice. In mechanism, sesamin reduced the expression of VEGFA to inhibit hypoxia-induced CRC angiogenesis. In addition, sesamin inhibited the phosphorylation of IκBα and thus restrained NF-κB p65 to activate HIF-1α transcription under hypoxic conditions. Finally, our results indicated that sesamin inhibited hypoxia-induced CRC angiogenesis via the NF-κB/HIF-1α/VEGFA signaling pathway. Our study might provide a theoretical and experimental basis for the use of sesamin in the prevention and treatment of CRC.",

Irisin is a newly discovered myokine that has attracted great interest as a key target to prevent/treat obesity and its related metabolic diseases. However, the effect and potential mechanism of sesamin on FNDC5/irisin are still vacant. In this study, we showed that sesamin treatment increased FNDC5/irisin activation and regulated SIRT1, PGC-1α, and p-SMAD3/SMAD3 expression in C2C12 cells. By using specific inhibitors and lentivirus in C2C12 cells, we found that the SIRT1/SMAD3 axis plays an important role in sesamin regulated FNDC5/irisin activation. We also found that sesamin treatment activated FNDC5 expression and regulated the SIRT1/SMAD3 signaling axis in mice's skeletal muscle. What is more, by the high-fat diet induced obese model, we further showed that sesamin improved the high-fat diet induced decrease in irisin production and secretion, which results in an improvement of body weight gain and skeletal muscle dysfunction. Our results suggested that sesamin could activate FNDC5 expression and stimulate irisin secretion through the SIRT1 pathway both in vitro and in vivo, which may provide a new strategy for preventing and improving irisin deficiency related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporotic fracture has been regarded as one of the most common bone disorders in the aging society. The natural herb-derived small molecules were revealed as potential treatment approaches for osteoporotic fracture healing. Sesamin is a member of lignan family, which possesses estrogenic activity and plays a significant role in modulating bone homeostasis. Our previous study reported the promoting effect of sesamin on postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment. However, the role of sesamin in osteoporotic fracture healing has not been well studied yet. In this study, we further investigated the putative treatment effect of sesamin on osteoporotic fracture healing. Our study indicated that sesamin could activate bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) signaling pathway and further promotes in vitro chondrogenesis and angiogenesis activities. This promoting effect was abolished by the treatment of ERα inhibitor. In the osteoporotic bone fracture model, we demonstrated that sesamin markedly improves the callus formation and increases the cartilaginous area at the early-stage, as well as narrowing the fracture gap, and expands callus volume at the late-stage fracture healing site of the OVX mice femur. Furthermore, the angiogenesis at the osteoporotic fracture site was also significantly improved by sesamin treatment. In conclusion, our research illustrated the therapeutic potential and underlying regulation mechanisms of sesamin on osteoporotic fracture healing. Our studies shed light on developing herb-derived bioactive compounds as novel drugs for the treatment of osteoporotic fracture healing, especially for postmenopausal women with low estrogen level.",

Sesamin, a phytonutrient of the lignan class, exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective properties. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of sesamin against Pb-induced learning and memory deficits, disruption of hippocampal theta and gamma rhythms, inflammatory response, inhibition of blood δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) activity, Pb accumulation, and neuronal loss in rats. METHODS: Sesamin treatment (30 mg/kg/day; P.O.) was started simultaneously with Pb acetate exposure (500 ppm in standard drinking water) in rats, and they continued for eight consecutive weeks. RESULTS: The results showed that chronic exposure to Pb disrupted the learning and memory functions in both passive-avoidance and water-maze tests, which was accompanied by increase in spectral theta power and theta/gamma ratio, and a decrease in spectral gamma power in the hippocampus. Additionally, Pb exposure resulted in an enhanced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) content, decreased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production, inhibited blood δ-ALA-D activity, increased Pb accumulation, and neuronal loss of rats. In contrast, sesamin treatment improved all the above-mentioned Pb-induced pathological changes. CONCLUSION: This data suggests that sesamin could improve Pb-induced learning and memory deficits, possibly through amelioration of hippocampal theta and gamma rhythms, modulation of inflammatory status, restoration of the blood δ-ALA-D activity, reduction of Pb accumulation in the blood and the brain tissues, and prevention of neuronal loss.",

Sesame lignans (sesamin, sesamolin, and sesamol) are unique bioactive compounds responsible for the nutritional function of sesame oils. However, the preventive effects of three lignans on oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in steatosis HepG2 cells have not been compared. In this study, we investigated the role of sesamin, sesamolin, and sesamol on hepatic lipid accumulation and explored the underlying mechanism via a well-established cell model. The results showed that 3 μg/ml of lignans could decrease the TG/TC contents and alleviate cellular oxidative stress, with an order of the lipid-lowering effect as sesamol > sesamin > sesamolin. The lignan-activated AMPK and PPAR signaling pathways enhanced gene and protein expressions related to fatty acid oxidation, cholesterol efflux, and catabolism. Meanwhile, treatment of the steatosis HepG2 cells with sesamin, sesamolin, and sesamol reduced lipid synthesis and cholesterol uptake, thus lowering intracellular lipogenesis in the process of NAFLD. Our data suggested that sesame lignans can attenuate oxidative stress and regulate lipid metabolism in liver cells, which may be potential therapeutic agents for treating the NAFLD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The present work demonstrated that sesame lignans can be used for dietary supplements or functional additives with excellent lipid-lowering effects. Furthermore, this study supplied potential molecular mechanisms involved in NAFLD treatment process, and also provided nutritional guidelines for sesame oil evaluation and selection.",

      "abstract": "The use of dietary phytochemical rather than conventional therapies to treat numerous cancers is now a well-known approach in medical science. Easily available and less toxic dietary phytochemicals present in plants should be introduced in the list of phytochemical-based treatment areas. Sesamin, a natural phytochemical, may be a promising chemopreventive agent aiming to manage breast cancer. In this study, we discussed the pharmacological properties of sesamin that determine its therapeutics opportunity to be used in breast cancer treatment and other diseases. Sesamin is available in medicinal plants, especially in Sesamum indicum, and is easily metabolized by the liver. To better understand the antibreast cancer consequence of sesamin, we postulate some putative pathways related to the antibreast cancer mechanism: (1) regulation of estrogen receptor (ER-α and ER-β) activities, (2) suppressing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) overexpression, (3) growth factor receptor inhibition, and (4) some tyrosine kinase pathways. Targeting these pathways, sesamin can modulate cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, cell growth and viability, metastasis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and oncogene inactivation in various in vitro and animal models. Although the actual tumor intrinsic signaling mechanism targeted by sesamin in cancer treatment is still unknown, this review summarized that this phytoestrogen suppressed NF-κB, STAT, MAPK, and PIK/AKT signaling pathways and activated some tumor suppressor protein in numerous breast cancer models. Cotreatment with γ-tocotrienol, conventional drugs, and several drug carriers systems increased the anticancer potentiality of sesamin. Furthermore, sesamin exhibited promising pharmacokinetics properties with less toxicity in the bodies. Overall, the shreds of evidence highlight that sesamin can be a potent candidate to design drugs against breast cancer. So, like other phytochemicals, sesamin can be consumed for better therapeutic advantages due to having the ability to target a plethora of molecular pathways until clinically trialed standard drugs are not available in pharma markets."

Due to the unsatisfied outcome of current therapies, a novel strategy needs to be developed. BV2 microglial cells were treated with 25 natural compounds, respectively, stimulated by high glucose (HG) to screen for a potential candidate drug. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were injected with different doses of the candidate sesamin every 2 days for 1 mo. Then, its protective role and possible mechanism were evaluated. Sesamin was selected as the candidate drug due to its inhibition on the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) in the screen assay. Sesamin also dose-dependently inhibited mRNA levels of HG-induced inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, activated NF-κB signaling pathway, and reduced oxidative stress by decreasing reactive oxygen species levels and increasing antioxidant enzymes in the BV2 and primary retinal microglia. In addition, sesamin alleviated brain-retinal barrier breakdown by Evans blue leakage assay and reduced inflammation in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. In conclusion, sesamin effectively inhibits HG-induced microglial inflammation in the retina both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that sesamin might serve as a candidate drug for DR treatment.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Sesamin effectively inhibits HG-induced microglial inflammation in the retina both in vivo and in vitro, which suggests that sesamin might serve as a candidate drug for diabetic retinopathy treatment.",

      "abstract": "As one of the leading causes of bone fracture in postmenopausal women and in older men, osteoporosis worldwide is attracting more attention in recent decades. Osteoporosis is a common disease mainly resulting from an imbalance of bone formation and bone resorption. Pharmaceutically active compounds that both activate osteogenesis, while repressing osteoclastogenesis hold the potential of being therapeutic medications for osteoporosis treatment. In the present study, sesamin, a bioactive ingredient derived from the seed of Sesamum Indicum, was screened out from a bioactive compound library and shown to exhibit dual-regulating functions on these two processes. Sesamin was demonstrated to promote osteogenesis by upregulating Wnt/β-catenin, while repressing osteoclastogenesis via downregulating NF-κB signaling . Furthermore, DANCR was found to be the key regulator in sesamin-mediated bone formation and resorption . In an ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mouse model, sesamin could rescue OVX-induced bone loss and impairment. The increased serum level of DANCR caused by OVX was also downregulated upon sesamin treatment. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that sesamin plays a dual-functional role in both osteogenesis activation and osteoclastogenesis de-activation in a DANCR-dependent manner, suggesting that it may be a possible medication candidate for osteoporotic patients with elevated DNACR expression levels.",

      "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the pharmacological effects of sesamin (Ses) and its mechanism of action towards PM2.5-induced cardiovascular injuries. Method: Forty Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into five groups: a saline control group; a PM2.5 exposure group; and low-, middle-, and high-dose Ses pretreatment groups. The SD rats were pretreated with different concentrations of Ses for 21 days. Afterward, the rats were exposed to ambient PM2.5 by intratracheal instillation every other day for a total of three times. The levels of inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and indicators related to oxidative responses, such as total superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA), were measured in the blood and heart. The expression of ferroptosis-related proteins in heart tissues was determined via western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: Ses pretreatment substantially ameliorated cardiovascular injuries in rats as evidenced by the decrease in the pathological score and collagen area. The decreased levels of SOD, GSH, and GSH-Px in the heart and serum were inhibited by Ses. In addition, Ses not only notably increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes but also reduced the levels of MDA, CK, LDH, CK-MB, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Furthermore, Ses pretreatment upregulated the expression levels of GPX4, SLC7A11, TFRC, and FPN1 and inhibited the expression levels of FTH1 and FTL. Conclusion: Ses pretreatment could ameliorate PM2.5-induced cardiovascular injuries perhaps by inhibiting ferroptosis. Therefore, Ses pretreatment may be a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of PM2.5-induced cardiovascular injury.",

Previous studies have reported that sesamin can inhibit the proliferation of several types of tumour cells and exert antitumour effects. However, the antitumour effect of sesamin on T-cell lymphoma is still unknown. In this study, we selected a T-cell lymphoma mouse model to investigate the mechanism of sesamin against T-cell lymphoma via programmed cell death in vivo and in vitro. We found that sesamin could significantly inhibit the growth of EL4 cells in a tumour-bearing mouse model. Sesamin markedly inhibited the proliferation of EL4 cells by inducing apoptosis, pyroptosis and autophagy. Autophagy occurred earlier than apoptosis and pyroptosis in EL4 cells after sesamin treatment. Blocking autophagy inhibited apoptosis and pyroptosis in EL4 cells after sesamin treatment. Taken together, these results suggested that sesamin promoted apoptosis and pyroptosis via autophagy to enhance antitumour effects on murine T-cell lymphoma. This study expands our knowledge of the pharmacological effects of sesamin on T-cell lymphoma, and provides a theoretical basis for the development of new antitumour drugs and treatments for T-cell lymphoma.",

Sesamin possesses potent anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties for various cancers. This study is designed to unravel the biological functions of sesamin and TRIM44 in esophageal cancer. TRIM44 expression in esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) cell lines and tissues was determined by RT-qPCR assay and Western blot. The effects of sesamin and TRIM44 on ESCC cell growth in vivo and in vitro were assessed by the mouse model and CCK-8 assay, respectively. We found that TRIM44 was significantly upregulated in ESCC cell lines and tissues when compared to their counterparts. Sesamin treatment or depletion of TRIM44 markedly reduced ESCC cell proliferation. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway may be involved in sesamin-mediated TRIM44 suppression. Finally, we showed that oral administration of sesamin dramatically inhibited tumor growth or ESCC in nude mice. Our results suggest that sesamin exerts anti-tumor activity in ESCC via inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway, demonstrating its potential for the treatment of esophageal cancer.",

Plant lignans have the potential to induce cancer cell death and interfere with carcinogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Epidemiological studies have revealed that the intake of lignans is inversely associated with the risk of several cancers. Moreover, numerous experimental studies demonstrate that natural lignans significantly suppress cancer cell proliferation with minimal toxicity against non-transformed cells. Dietary lignans arctigenin and sesamin have been found to have potent antiproliferative activities against various types of human cancer. The purpose of this review is to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying anticancer effects of arctigenin and sesamin. Our review comprehensively describes the effects of arctigenin and sesamin on the signaling pathways and related molecules involved in cancer cell proliferation and invasion. The findings of present review show that the dietary lignans arctigenin and sesamin seem to be promising carcinopreventive and anticancer agents. These natural lignans can be used as dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals for prevention and treatment of cancer.",

To date, no review has been conducted to summarize or analyze the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory roles of sesamin. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of experimental findings that were reported with regards to the ability of sesamin to modulate inflammation, cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses and Th1/Th2 paradigm. The potential influence of sesamin on the cytotoxic activity of NK cells against cancer cells is also highlighted. The molecular mechanisms and the signal transduction pathways underlying such effects are underscored. The metabolism, pharmacokinetics, absorption, tissue distribution and bioavailability of sesamin in different species, including humans, are reviewed. Moreover, we propose future preclinical and clinical investigations to further validate the potential preventive and/or therapeutic efficacy of sesamin against various immune-related and inflammatory conditions. We anticipate that sesamin may be employed in future therapeutic regimens to enhance the efficacy of treatment and dampen the adverse effects of synthetic chemical drugs currently used to alleviate immune-related and inflammatory conditions.",

METHODS: SES (50, 100, and 200 mg kg-1) were orally administered to C57BL/6 male mice after DSS instillation. The anti-inflammatory effect of SES on colonic damage was assessed by clinical, macroscopic, microscopic, and inflammatory signaling pathways. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: It could be found that bodyweight and colon length of mice treated with DSS was significantly decreased while that were increased by SES treatment. SES treatment reduced the DAI values and improved the histopathology of the colon in the DSS-treated mice. SES also reduced TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 production caused by DSS. We also measured the expression of the phosphorylation of p65, IκB, p38, ERK and JNK protein and found that SES can alleviate colon damage via the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. The findings of this study suggested that SES had anti-inflammatory effects on intestinal inflammation and can be used as a new therapeutic candidate for inflammatory bowel disease.",

Sesamin (Ses), a major lignan of sesame seed and its oil, shows anti-hyperglycemic, anti-oxidative, and neuroprotective effects. The present study was designed to assess the potential protective effects of Ses against DABD and investigate the roles of inflammatory markers and neurotrophic factors in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. After confirmation of diabetes, Ses (30 mg/kg/day; P.O.) or insulin (6 IU/rat/day; S.C.) was administered to rats for eight consecutive weeks. During the eighth-week period of the study, behavioral functions of the animals were evaluated by employing standard behavioral paradigms. Moreover, inflammation status, neurotrophic factors, and histological changes were assessed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal regions of the rats. The results of behavioral tests showed that STZ-induced diabetes increased anxiety-/depression-like behaviors, decreased locomotor/exploratory activities, and impaired passive avoidance learning and memory. These DABD were accompanied by neuroinflammation, lack of neurotrophic support, and neuronal loss in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the rats. Intriguingly, chronic treatment with Ses improved all the above-mentioned diabetes-related behavioral, biochemical, and histological deficits, and in some cases, it was even more effective than insulin therapy. In conclusion, the results suggest that Ses was capable of improving DABD, which might be ascribed, at least partly, to the reduction of blood glucose level, inhibition of neuroinflammation, and potentiation of neurotrophic factors.",

In the present study, the anti-leukemic effects of sesamin and its underlying mechanisms were investigated in MOLT-4 and NB4 acute leukemic cells. Leukemic cells were treated with various concentrations of sesamin. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay. Flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and anti-LC3/FITC antibodies was applied to detect the level of apoptosis and autophagy, respectively. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to examine the alterations in the mRNA expression of apoptotic and autophagic genes. In addition, bioinformatics tools were used to predict the possible interactions between sesamin and its targets. The results revealed that sesamin inhibited MOLT-4 and NB4 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, sesamin induced both apoptosis and autophagy. In sesamin-treated cells, the gene expression levels of caspase 3 and unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) were upregulated, while those of mTOR were downregulated compared with in the control. Notably, the protein-chemical interaction network indicated that caspase 3, mTOR and ULK1 were the essential factors involved in the effects of sesamin treatment, as with anticancer agents, such as rapamycin, AZD8055, Torin1 and 2. Overall, the findings of the present study suggested that sesamin inhibited MOLT-4 and NB4 cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis and autophagy through the regulation of caspase 3 and mTOR/ULK1 signaling, respectively."

However, its protective effects against fluoride-induced damage in the liver of zebrafish have not been elucidated. Our previous studies found that fluoride exposure caused damage to the liver of zebrafish. In the study, the effects of sesamin on oxidative stress and immune damage in liver of zebrafish exposed to fluoride were measured. The results indicated that fluoride exposure damaged the microstructures of liver, increased significantly the oxidative stress, decreased remarkably the activities of ACP, AKP, and LZM, and affected obviously the expressions of immune-related genes. Treatment with sesamin remarkably attenuated fluoride-induced liver damage in a dose-dependent manner, indicated by the histopathological observation. Furthermore, sesamin treatment also significantly inhibited the production of ROS and oxidative stress, such as the decrease of lipid peroxidation level and the increase of CAT and SOD activities in liver. Sesamin treatment reversed the activities of immune-related enzymes and the expressions of immune-related genes in liver exposed to fluoride. These findings suggested that sesamin could protect the liver from fluoride-induced immune damage by oxidative stress downstream-mediated changes in reversing the activities of immune-related enzymes and the expressions of immune-related genes. Taken together, sesamin plays an important role in maintaining hepatic health and preventing liver from toxic damage caused by fluoride.",

      "abstract": "Sesamin, a lipid-soluble lignin originally isolated from sesame seeds, which induces cancer cell apoptosis and autophagy. In the present study, has been reported that sesamin induces apoptosis via several pathways in human lung cancer cells. However, whether mitophagy is involved in sesamin induced lung cancer cell apotosis remains unclear. This study, the anticancer activity of sesamin in lung cancer was studied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitophagy. A549 cells were treated with sesamin, and cell viability, migration ability, and cell cycle were assessed using the CCK8 assay, scratch-wound test, and flow cytometry, respectively. ROS levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometric detection of DCFH-DA fluorescence and by using JC-1 and TUNEL assays. The results indicated that sesamin treatment inhibited the cell viability and migration ability of A549 cells and induced G0/G1 phase arrest. Furthermore, sesamin induced an increase in ROS levels, a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis accompanied by an increase in cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9. Additionally, sesamin triggered mitophagy and increased the expression of PINK1 and translocation of Parkin from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria. However, the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine clearly reduced the oxidative stress and mitophagy induced by sesamin. Furthermore, we found that cyclosporine A (an inhibitor of mitophagy) decreased the inhibitory effect of sesamin on A549 cell viability. Collectively, our data indicate that sesamin exerts lethal effects on lung cancer cells through the induction of ROS-mediated mitophagy and mitochondrial apoptosis."

      "abstract": "The promotion of neurogenesis can be a promising strategy to improve and restore neuronal function in neurodegenerative diseases. Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays a key role in neurite outgrowth and synaptic formation during brain repair stage. Nowadays, there are several studies on the developing methods to enhance the endogenous NGF activity for treatment and restore the neuronal function. In this study, the potentiating effect of sesamin, a major lignan in sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum) and oil, on NGF-induced neurogenesis and its involved mechanisms were firstly reported. Sesamin effectively enhanced the PC12 neuron-like cell differentiation and neurite length under insufficient conditions of NGF. The neuronal markers including synaptophysin and growth-associated protein-43 along with the synaptic connections were significantly increased in combination treatment between sesamin and NGF. Moreover, sesamin also increased the level of phospho-ERK1/2 and SIRT1 protein, an important regulatory protein of the neurogenesis process. The neurogenesis was blocked by the specific SIRT1 inhibitor, JGB1741, suggesting that the neuritogenic effect of sesamin was associated with SIRT1 protein modulation. Taken together, the potentiating effect of sesamin on NGF-induced neurogenesis in this finding could be used for alternative treatment in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease."

      "abstract": "Changing consumption patterns and increasing health awareness, especially in Europe, are resulting in an increased demand for sesame seeds. In 2016, Asia imported the highest quantity of sesame seeds, followed by Europe and North America. We examined, for the first time, the effects of treatment with sesame oil and sesamin in hearing impairment models. Sesame oil exhibited an ameliorative effect on auditory impairment in a hair cell line in zebrafish and mice. In ototoxic zebrafish larvae, neuromasts and otic cells increased in numbers because of sesame oil. Furthermore, auditory function in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) was studied through auditory brainstem response to evaluate the therapeutic effects of sesame oil. Sesame oil reduced the hearing threshold shift in response to clicks and 8, 16-kHz tone bursts in NIHL mice. Auditory-protective effect of sesame oil was seen in zebrafish and mice; therefore, we used chromatographic analysis to study sesamin, which is the major effective factor in sesame oil. To investigate its effects related to auditory function, we studied the hearing-related gene, Tecta, using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Auditory cell proliferation was induced by treatment with sesame oil and sesamin using Tecta (Tectorin Alpha) regulation. The expression of Tecta increases in the apex area of the cochlear hair cells as they grow, and their activity is enhanced by sesame oil and sesamin. These results provide a novel mechanistic insight into the sesame oil activities and suggest that sesamin, the key constituent in sesame oil, is responsible for its auditory function related benefits, including protection of auditory cells and reversal of their impairments.",

      "abstract": "Liver X receptor (LXR) is a nuclear receptor that regulates various biological processes, including de novo lipogenesis, cholesterol metabolism, and inflammation. Selective inhibition of LXR may aid the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Sesamin is a naturally occurring lignan in many dietary plants and has a wide range of beneficial effects on metabolism. The mechanism underlying sesamin action especially on the regulation of LXR remains elusive. Reporter assays, mRNA and protein expression, and in silico modeling were used to identify sesamin as an antagonist of LXRα. Sesamin was applied to the hepatic HepaRG and intestinal LS174T cells and showed that it markedly ameliorated lipid accumulation in the HepaRG cells, by reducing LXRα transactivation, inhibiting the expression of downstream target genes. This effect was associated with the stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, followed by decreased T0901317-LXRα-induced expression of SREBP-1c and its downstream target genes. Mechanistically, sesamin reduced the recruitment of SRC-1 but enhanced that of SMILE to the SREBP-1c promoter region under T0901317 treatment. It regulated the transcriptional control exerted by LXRα by influencing its interaction with coregulators and thus decreased mRNA and protein levels of genes downstream of LXRα and reduced lipid accumulation in hepatic cells. Additionally, sesamin reduced valproate- and rifampin-induced LXRα and pregnane X receptor (PXR) transactivation. This was associated with reduced expression of target genes and decreased lipid accumulation. Thus, sesamin is an antagonist of LXRα and PXR and suggests that it may alleviate drug-induced lipogenesis via the suppression of LXRα and PXR signaling."

Moreover, treatment with SES promoted the gene and protein expression levels of insulin receptor (InsR) and the post-receptor associated proteins, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), GLUT4 (glucose transporter 4) significantly, which were determined by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. In conclusion, SES has the ameliorating effect on L02 hepatocyte model of insulin resistance induced by high glucose/high insulin, which might be related to its effect on promoting expression of insulin receptor and its associated proteins of IRS-PI3K-Akt passway, and thus promoting insulin sensitivity.",

The angiogenesis effect of sesamin was evaluated by the abilities of adherence, migration and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our data demonstrated that treatment with sesamin dose-dependently promoted the proliferation, adherence, migration and enhanced their angiogenic ability in vitro. Moreover, the increased apoptosis in HUVECs, which stimulated by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) was significantly attenuated by the sesamin treatment. Furthermore, we revealed that neogenesis of granulation tissue and deposition and remodeling of the collagen matrix were accelerated by the administration of sesamin in our in vivo study. These results confirm that sesamin accelerates wound healing at least partly through its antiapoptotic effects on endothelial cells at the injury site.

On the 11th day, rats were sacrificed, and blood and urine samples and kidneys were collected for biochemical estimation of several traditional and novel indices of renal damage in plasma and urine, several oxidative and nitrosative indices in kidneys, and assessment of histopathological renal damage. CP significantly and adversely altered all the physiological, biochemical and histopathological indices of renal function measured. Kidneys of CP-treated rats had a moderate degree of necrosis. This was markedly lessened when CP was given simultaneously with sesamin. Sesamin treatment did not significantly alter the renal CP concentration.

      "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer with a disappointing prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the anticancer effect of sesamin and the underlying mechanism. The MTT assay was used to detect the proliferation of NSCLC cells. The cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein levels of Akt, p-Akt (Ser473), p53, cyclin D1, CDK2, MDM2, p-MDM2 (Ser166) were detected by western blotting. The expression of p-Akt (Ser473), p53 and Ki67 in vivo was analyzed by IHC. Histopathologic analyses of major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney) were performed by H&E staining. The results show that sesamin suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells (A549 and H1792) in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with sesamin caused cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and inhibited cyclin D1 and CDK2 expression. In addition, sesamin inhibited Akt activity and upregulated p53 expression both in vivo and in vitro. When Akt and p53 were suppressed by LY294002 and PFTα, respectively, sesamin exerted no additional effects. The in vivo results mostly matched the in vitro findings. Specifically, sesamin exerted little damage to major organs. Taken together, this study demonstrates that sesamin suppresses NSCLC cell proliferation by induction of G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via Akt/p53 pathway. Therefore, sesamin may be a promising adjuvant treatment for NSCLC therapy.",

To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study with effects of sesamin on I/R injury model. We aimed to investigate the protective effect of sesamin on mesenteric I/R injury model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Control group: superior mesenteric artery (SMA) exposed without clamping. I/R group: SMA was clamped for 60 min and then reperfused for 2 h. Sesamin group (S): 30 mg/kg sesamin were given for 5 days, and SMA exposed without clamping. I/R + S group: 30 mg/kg sesamin were given for 5 days, SMA was clamped for 60 min, and then reperfused for 2 h. Plasma and tissue oxidant parameters were investigated as well as histopathological evaluation. RESULTS: Plasma and tissue total antioxidant status (TAS) levels were significantly higher in I/R + S group compared to the rest (p < 0.005). The plasma TAS levels in I/R group was significantly low. The highest tissue TAS levels were detected in I/R + S group. The high levels of plasma and tissue TOS were found in I/R + S group. Plasma and tissue OSI levels were significantly higher in I/R group. Histopathologic evaluation showed that the mean level of intestinal tissue injury score in I/R group was 2.75 and 1.38 in I/R + S group. CONCLUSIONS: Sesamin helps to protect the intestinal tissue at the cellular level by reducing the oxidative stress and inflammation at both the plasma and tissue levels in the experimental I/R model."

Gut microbiota play pivotal roles in mediating psychological behaviors by regulating gut barrier integrity and systemic inflammatory responses. Here, we found that oral sesamin administration (50 mg/kg·bodyweight/day) significantly attenuated depressive, aversive, repetitive, and anxiety-like behaviors in a long-term multiple nonsocial stress-treated mice model. Sesamin inhibited stress-induced gut barrier integrity damage, reduced circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, sesamin treatment also restructured the gut microbiome by enhancing the relative abundances of Bacteroidales and S24-7. The correlation analysis indicated that the microbiota composition changes were strongly correlated with behavioral disorders, serotonin, norepinephrine, and LPS levels. In conclusion, sesamin has preventive effects on stress-induced behavioral and psychological disorders, which might be highly related to the reshaped microbiota composition. This study provides a clue for understanding the systemic mechanism of anti-depression effects of sesamin.",

This study explored the protective effects and mechanisms of sesamin against skin photodamage. Sesamin reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species production after UVB irradiation in human dermal fibroblasts. The sesamin treatment attenuated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) overexpression induced by UVB exposure, and it significantly enhanced the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 protein expression. Sesamin also elevated the total collagen content in human fibroblasts by inhibiting UVB-induced mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 (Smad7) protein expression. Sesamin reduced UVB-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression and inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) translocation. Moreover, sesamin may regulate the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase pathways, which inhibit COX-2 expression. Sesamin could reduce UVB-induced inflammation, epidermal hyperplasia, collagen degradation, and wrinkle formation in hairless mice. It also reduced MMP-1, interleukin (IL-1), i-NOS, and NF-κB in the mouse skin. These results demonstrate that sesamin had antiphotodamage and anti-inflammatory activities.

      "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration-related diseases are common health problems in the department of orthopedics. However, there is no effective treatment protecting the intervertebral disc from degeneration. Sesamin, a kind of sesame lignans extracted from sesame seed oil, has been proved to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation and extracellular matrix catabolism in rat intervertebral disc in vitro and ex vivo. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of sesamin on lesion-induced intervertebral disc degeneration in vivo. Degeneration of rat tail disc was induced by puncture lesion, followed by intradiscal injection of sesamin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, histological analysis, and biochemical analysis were carried out to analyze degeneration progression 2 weeks after surgery. As shown by results, intradiscal injection of sesamin inhibited the MRI signal decrease of nucleus pulposus (NP) in T2-weighted images. The upregulated mRNA expression of MMP-3 and ADAMTS-5 induced by lesion was significantly suppressed by sesamin injection. Sesamin partly protected mRNA expression of Col2a1 and Acan from downregulation. Intradiscal injection of sesamin effectively maintained the normal morphology of disc and inhibited lesion-induced degeneration-related histological changes. Immunohistochemical assay demonstrated that the upregulation of degradative enzymes protein expression and the downregulation of type II collagen expression in NP were suppressed by sesamin. According to biochemical analysis, sesamin significantly inhibited the lesion-induced decrease of proteoglycan content in NP. The present study proved the protective effects of sesamin on lesion-induced intervertebral disc degeneration at an early stage.",

Patients received 200-mg/day sesamin supplement or placebo in the intervention and control group for 6 weeks. Serum levels of proteolytic enzymes (hyaluronidase, aggrecanase, and matrix metalloproteinases-3) and inflammatory biomarkers (hs-CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and cyclooxygenase-2) were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method at the beginning and end of the study. After intervention, serum levels of hyaluronidase and matrix metalloproteinases-3 decreased significantly in sesamin group. Also, serum levels of hs-CRP, TNF-α, and cyclooxygenase-2 in intervention group were significantly decreased in intervention group compared with placebo group. Sesamin supplementation also caused a significant reduction in the number of tender joints and severity of pain in these patients.

      "abstract": "AIMS: Hippocampal oxidative stress and apoptosis of CA1 neurons play significant roles in the pathophysiology of diabetes-associated cognitive decline (DACD). The present study was aimed to elucidate the putative effects of sesamin, a major lignan of sesame seed, against DACD, and possible involvement of anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. MAIN METHODS: Fifty adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control, control-sesamin (30 mg/kg/day), diabetic, diabetic-sesamin (30 mg/kg/day), and diabetic-insulin (6 IU/rat/day) groups. Diabetic rats were treated with sesamin (P.O.) or insulin (S.C.) for eight consecutive weeks. Cognitive performance was evaluated in a Morris Water Maze (MWM) test; in addition, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were assayed in the hippocampus using assay kits. Moreover, hematoxylin-eosin (HE), TUNEL, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stainings were conducted to evaluate histological changes, the apoptosis status and expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in the hippocampal CA1 neurons, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that diabetes reduced the spatial cognitive ability in MWM, which was accompanied by decrease in SOD, CAT, and GPx activities and increase in MDA level in the hippocampus. Additionally, diabetes resulted in neuronal loss, enhanced apoptotic index, elevated the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax protein, and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in the hippocampal CA1 neurons. Interestingly, sesamin treatment improved all the above-mentioned deficits of diabetes at a comparable level with insulin therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that sesamin could be a promising potential therapeutic agent against DACD, possibly through its intertwined anti-hyperglycemic, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic properties.",

In this study, the metabolites of sesamin in rats administrated with sesamin (100 mg/kg b.w.) were analyzed without sulfatase/β-glucuronidase treatment. Two sulfate conjugates of sesamin monocatechol (SC-1) were detected in the liver and plasma. Their Cmax values were 5- and 10-times higher than that of sesamin itself. The Vmax/Km values for sulfate conjugation in the cytosol fraction of human liver were 1.7-times larger than that in the cytosol fraction of rat liver, suggesting that sulfate conjugation also occurs in human liver. The recombinant human proteins SULT1A1, 1A3, 1B1, and 1E1 expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells produced sulfate conjugates effectively.

Annually, tens of millions of patients suffer from pain related to ONFH. Researchers have proposed several underlying mechanisms of ONFH, including osteocyte apoptosis, cell differentiation disorder, and angiogenesis hindrance. Sesamin, isolated from Sesamum indicum seeds, was reported could affect osteocyte inflammation and differentiation in osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. We investigated the underlying influence of sesamin on ONFH rat model. Fifteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups. The ONFH model group only received the methylprednisolone (MPS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to promote the development of ONFH. The sesamin treatment group was injected with sesamin, MPS, and LPS. The control group was untreated. Rats from above groups were sacrificed 4 weeks later. The effect of sesamin on ONFH rats was validated by H&E staining. TUNEL staining showed that femoral head necrosis was attenuated by sesamin. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Akt was increased and the downstream cellular apoptosis signal pathway was inhibited. Intracellular ROS level was decreased after sesamin treatment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that sesamin protects the femoral head from osteonecrosis by inhibiting ROS-induced osteoblast apoptosis."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is considered a major public health concern in today's world. Sepsis-induced AKI is large as a result of exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is the major outer membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria. Sesamin is the main lignan of sesame seeds with multiple protective effects. OBJECTIVE: In this research, we tried to demonstrate the protective effect of sesamin pretreatment in LPS-induced mouse model of AKI. METHODS: LPS was injected at a single dose of 10 mg/kg (i.p.) and sesamin was given p.o. at doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg, one hour prior to LPS. RESULTS: Treatment of LPS-challenged mice with sesamin reduced serum level of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and returned back renal oxidative stress-related parameters including glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Moreover, sesamin alleviated inappropriate changes of renal nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-6, DNA fragmentation (an apoptotic index), and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). In addition, sesamin diminished magnitude of kidney tissue damage due to LPS. CONCLUSION: In summary, sesamin could dose-dependently abrogate LPS-induced AKI via attenuation of renal oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.",

This study is aimed to determine the potential antidepressant effects of (+)-sesamin, a lignan component of sesame, in a mild stress-induced depression mouse model. CD-1 mice were treated with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) process and orally administrated with sesamin (50 mg/kg/d) for 6 weeks. Behavioral tests including forced swimming test, tail suspension test, open field test, and elevated plus maze test demonstrated that sesamin treatment inhibited CUMS-induced mice depressant-like behaviors and anxiety, without changing immobility. It was found that sesamin prevented stress-induced decease levels of 5-HT and NE in striatum and serum. Cognitive deficits were assessed using Y-maze and Morris water maze test. Sesamin treatment also prevented stressed-induced memory impairments and neuronal damages. Consistently, sesamin also enhanced synapse ultrastructure and improved expressions of PSD-95 in stressed mice hippocampus with improving neurotrophic factors expression including BDNF and NT3. Moreover, sesamin treatment significantly prevented CUMS-induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting over-activation of microglia and expressions of inflammatory mediators including iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α and IL-1β in stressed mice hippocampus and cortex. These results illustrated that sesamin markedly improved CUMS-induced depression and memory loss via inhibiting neuroinflammation, which indicate that as food component, sesamin might be also a novel potential therapeutic for depression.",

At the present, there is no approved drug with a proven disease-modifying effect. Sesame seed (Sesame indicum) has long been known as a healthy food in Southeast Asian countries. Sesame lignans obtained from sesame seed possess antioxidant property that exhibit a variety of beneficial effects in various models. The objective of this study was to investigate the protective effects of sesame lignans including sesamin, sesamolin, and sesamol against Aβ toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model of Aβ toxicity and to address whether these sesame lignans have a positive effect on lifespan extension. A transgenic C. elegans expressing human Aβ was used to investigate protective effects of sesame lignans against Aβ toxicity. Sesamin and sesamolin significantly alleviated Aβ-induced paralysis. The real-time PCR revealed that both sesamin and sesamolin did not affect the expression of Aβ transgene. However, we found that only sesamin inhibited Aβ oligomerization. These findings demonstrated that, among three sesame lignans tested, sesamin protected against Aβ toxicity by reducing toxic Aβ oligomers. Sesamin and sesamolin also significantly improved Aβ-induced defect in chemotaxis behavior and reversed the defect to normal. Moreover, sesamin prolonged median and mean lifespan of the wild type worm. On the other hand, sesamolin and sesamol failed to extend lifespan. These results offer valuable evidence for the future use of sesamin in the development of agents for the treatment of AD. It is also worth investigating the structure-activity relationship of lignan-related structures and their anti-Aβ toxicity activities in the future.",

      "abstract": "By virtue of their regulatory role in the biological process, certain protein-protein complexes form potential targets for designing and discovery of drugs. Alteration set in the controlled formation of such complexes results in dysregulation of several metabolic processes, leading to diseased condition. β-catenin/Tcf4 complex is one such protein-protein complex found altered in colorectal epithelial cells resulting in activation of target genes leading to cancer. Recently, certain lignans from seeds of the oil crop sesame were found inhibiting initiation and progression of this type of cancer. Molecular mechanism involved in the process, however, is not yet known. By an in silico study, we present here a possible mechanism of interaction between the sesame lignans and β-catenin leading to inhibition of formation of the said complex, thereby elevating some of these ligands as potential lead molecules in the development of drugs for treatment of colon cancer. To achieve this objective, we performed docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy analysis of target-ligand complexes. Using computational alanine scanning approach, the key pocket residues of β-catenin that interact with Tcf4 in the formation of complex were identified. The test molecules were initially evaluated for their drug-like properties by application of Lipinski's rule of five. Results of this study revealed that Sesamin, a furofuran lignan from sesame, has the highest affinity for β-catenin particularly with its residues that interact with Tcf4 and thus serving as a potential lead molecule for development of a drug for colon cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cardiac remodeling is associated with oxidative stress. Sesamin, a well-known antioxidant from sesamin seeds, have been used extensively as traditional health foods. However, there is little known about the effect of sesamin on cardiac remodeling. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether sesamin could protect against cardiac remodeling and to clarify potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The mice were subjected to either transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgery (control group). Beginning one week after surgery, the mice were oral gavage treated with sesamin (100mg·kg-1·day-1) or vehicle for 3 weeks. Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by echocardiographic parameters, histological analyses and hypertrophic markers. RESULTS: Sesamin alleviated cardiac hypertrophy, inhibited fibrosis and attenuated the inflammatory response. The increased production of reactive oxygen species, the activation of ERK1/2-dependent nuclear factor-κB and the increased level of Smad2 phosphorylation were observed in cardiac remolding model that were treated with sesamin. Furthermore, TAC induced alteration of Sirt3 and SOD2 was normalized by sesamin treatment. Finally, a selective Sirt3 inhibitor 3-TYP blocks all the protective role of sesamin, suggesting that a Sirt3-dependent effect of sesamin on cardiac remodeling. CONCLUSION: Sesamin improves cardiac function and prevents the development of cardiac hypertrophy via Sirt3/ROS pathway. Our results suggest the protective effect of sesamin on cardiac remolding.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic synovitis, cartilage degradation and bone deformities. Synovitis is the term for inflammation of the synovial membrane, an early stage of RA. The pathogenesis of the disease occurs through cytokine induction. The major cytokine that increases the severity of RA is TNF-α. Thus, inhibition of the TNF-α cascade is an effective way to diminish the progression of the disease. We are interested in investigating the difference between primary human synovial fibroblast (hSF) cells and SW982 as synovitis models induced by TNF-α and in monitoring their responses to sesamin as an anti-inflammatory phytochemical. METHOD: The designed experiments were performed in hSF cells or the SW982 cell line treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α with or without 0.25, 0.5 or 1 μM sesamin. Subsequently, pro-inflammatory cytokine genes and proteins were measured in parallel with a study of associated signalling transduction involved in inflammatory processes, including NF-κB and MAPK pathways. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that although hSF and SW982 cells responded to TNF-α induction in the same fashion, they reacted at different levels. TNF-α could induce IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β in both cell types, but the levels in SW982 cells were much higher than in hSF cells. This characteristic was due to the different induction of MAPKs in each cell type. Both cell types reacted to sesamin in almost the same fashion. However, hSF cells were more sensitive to sesamin than SW982 cells in terms of the anti-RA effect. CONCLUSIONS: The responses of TNF-α-induced hSF and SW982 were different at the signal transduction level. However, the two cell types showed almost the same reaction to sesamin treatment in terms of the end point of the response.",

      "abstract": "Sesamin is the major active ingredient is Sesamum indicum seeds. Several studies revealed that sesamin possesses potent anti-cancer properties. The anti-cancer effects of sesamin have been mainly attributed to its anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-metastatic, anti- and pro-angiogenic, and pro-autophagocytic activities. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the reported anti-cancer effects of sesamin, both in vitro and in vivo. Experimental findings related to the potential of sesamin to attenuate oxidative stress, inflammation, proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis in various cancer cells and tumors are analyzed. Studies focusing on the ability of sesamin to induce apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells are also underscored. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of sesamin are highlighted, and the major signaling pathways targeted by sesamin are identified. Although the exact signaling events triggered by sesamin in cancer cells are not fully revealed, our analysis indicates that NF-κB, STAT3, JNK, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, PI3K/AKT, caspase-3, and p53 signaling pathways are critically involved in mediating the anti-cancer effects of sesamin. In sum, the experimental evidence suggesting that sesamin could exert potent anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo is compelling. Hence, sesamin can potentially be employed as an effective adjuvant therapeutic agent in ameliorating tumor development and progression, and therefore, it could be used in the prevention and/or treatment of various types of cancer.",

Here, the effect of sesamin on human osteoclasts was investigated in terms of differentiation and function in M-CSF and RANKL induced human PBMCs. Sesamin treatment significantly decreased the number of differentiated osteoclasts observed by TRAP staining; however, sesamin inhibition did not result from the alteration of precursor cell proliferation. Sesamin did not decrease NFATc1 gene expression, which opposed the decreasing trend of CathK and TRAP expression. DC-STAMP, but not Atp6v0d2, also significantly decreased in the presence of 14 µM sesamin. Expressions of CCR2b and CCR4 as chemokine receptors were significantly down-regulated. Sesamin might mediate the inhibition of human osteoclast differentiation, the recruitment of precursor cells and F-actin formation. Decrease in the area of the resorption pits and the collagen released from the bone slices under sesamin treatment emphasized the inhibitory effects on both the differentiation and function of osteoclasts. Sesamin is a promising phytochemical agent inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sesamin is a well-known antioxidant extracted from sesame seeds that exhibits various curative effects. The present study investigated whether sesamin would protect neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells against mechanical stretch injury-induced increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying these actives were investigated. Following exposure to mechanical stretch injury, cells were incubated for further investigations. Lactate dehydrogenase and Cell Counting Kit-8 assays were used to assess cell viability, and a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and flow cytometric analysis were performed to evaluate changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Furthermore, intracellular levels of ROS production were measured by 20, 70-dichlorofluorescein diacetate staining, the mRNA levels of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, and the determinations had also been made on related proteins by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Exposure to mechanical stretch injury significantly decreased cell viability but this decrease was attenuated by pretreatment with sesamin (50 μM). Sesamin also significantly inhibited mechanical stretch injury-induced increases in intracellular ROS production, attenuated declines in ΔΨm, diminished the expressions of pro-apoptotic proteins, and decreased cell apoptosis. Stretch injury increased Bax and cleaved caspase 3 levels, enhanced the gene expression of MMP-9, increased the phosphorylation levels of Akt, p38, and JNK and decreased Bcl-2 levels in the cells. However, pretreatment with sesamin reduced the mechanical stretch injury-induced overexpression of MMP-9. CONCLUSIONS: Sesamin protected SH-SY5Y cells against stretch injury by attenuating increases in ROS levels and suppressing apoptosis. Accordingly, sesamin seems to be a potentially therapeutic agent in the treatment of traumatic brain injury.",

      "abstract": "Sesamin, a major lignan of sesame oil, was reported to have neuroprotective effects in several brain injury models. However, its protective action in maintaining blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity has not been studied. In this study we investigated the effects of sesamin on the BBB in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and explored the underlying mechanisms. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury and then received sesamin (30 mg·kg-1·d-1, ip). The mice were euthanized on the 1st and 3rd days after CCI injury and samples were collected for analysis. Sesamin treatment significantly attenuated CCI-induced brain edema on the 1st and 3rd days after the injury, evidenced by the decreases in water content, tissue hemoglobin levels, Evans blue extravasation and AQP4 expression levels in the ipsilateral cortical tissue compared with the vehicle-treated group. Furthermore, sesamin treatment significantly alleviated CCI-induced loss of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin in the brain tissues. The neuroprotective mechanisms of sesamin were further explored in cultured mouse brain microvascular bEnd.3 cells subjected to biaxial stretch injury (SI). Pretreatment with sesamin (50 μmol/L) significantly alleviated SI-induced loss of ZO-1 in bEnd.3 cells. Furthermore, we revealed that pretreatment with sesamin significantly attenuated SI-induced oxidative stress and early-stage apoptosis in bEnd.3 cells by decreasing the activation of ERK, p-38 and caspase-3. In conclusion, sesamin alleviates BBB disruption at least partly through its anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects on endothelial cells in CCI injury. These findings suggest that sesamin may be a promising potential therapeutic intervention for preventing disruption of the BBB after TBI.",

The inflammatory response has been associated with the pathogenesis of left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. This study focused on the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of sesamin on ligation of the left anterior descending artery in an experimental mouse model and the potential mechanism underlying the activation of JNK and NF-κB pathways. Mice with MI induced by surgical left anterior descending coronary artery ligation were treated with sesamin by gavage for 1 week. Results showed that after treatment with sesamin, MI-induced cardiac damage was alleviated significantly, indicated by the histopathological examination. The myocardial apoptosis in the border zone was dramatically reduced by sesamin, resulting from the altered expression of apoptosis factors. Moreover, treatment with sesamin also mitigated the inflammatory response, decreased expression of cytokines and the inactivation of NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) signaling. Sesamin decreased the levels of p-JNK protein, which in turn inactivated pro-apoptotic signaling events by restoring the balance between mitochondrial pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bax proteins. Thus, our study suggests that sesamin could alleviate MI-induced cardiac dysfunction through decrease of myocardial apoptosis and inflammatory response.",

Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of mortality of 75% of patients with diabetes >40 years old. Sesamin, the bioactive compound extracted from Sesamum indicum, is a natural compound that has diverse beneficial effects on hypoglycemia and reducing cholesterol. The aim of this study is to investigate sesamin effects to diabetes-inducing cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study bioinformatics analysis demonstrated cardiac hypertrophy signaling may be the most important pathway for upregulating genes in sesamin-treated groups. To verify the bioinformatics prediction, sesamin was used as the main bioactive compound to attenuate the impact of diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ) on cardiac function in a rat model. The results revealed that oral administration of sesamin for 4 weeks (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) marginally improved blood glucose levels, body weight and significantly ameliorated the effects on heart rate and blood pressure in rats with type 1 diabetes relative to control rats. The QT interval of sesamin was also reduced relative to the control group. The findings indicated that sesamin has potential cardioprotective effects in the STZ-induced diabetes model. This suggested that this can be used as a novel treatment for patients with diabetes with cardiac dysfunction complication.",

A BALB/c mouse model with allergic asthma was used to evaluate the effects of sesamin on nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine protein expression in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to examine histological changes. Moreover, western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of proteins in tissues. Prior to administering sesamin, the mice developed the following pathophysiological features of asthma: An increase in the number of inflammatory cells, increased levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13, decreased levels of interferon-γ in BAL fluids and lung tissues, increased immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in the serum and an increased activation of NF-κB in lung tissues. Following treatment with sesamin, the mice had evidently reduced peribronchiolar inflammation and airway inflammatory cell recruitment, inhibited production of several cytokines in BAL fluids and lung tissues, and decreased IgE levels. Following inhalation of ovalbumin, the administration of sesamin also inhibited the activation of NF-κB. In addition, sesamin administration reduced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The present study demonstrates that sesamin decreases the activation of NF-κB in order to attenuate allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma, possibly via the regulation of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. These observations provide an important molecular mechanism for the potential use of sesamin in preventing and/or treating asthma, as well as other airway inflammatory disorders."

Results demonstrated that sesamin treatment significantly inhibited PGE2 and NO production induced by IL-1β. Sesamin inhibited MMP1, MMP3, and MMP13 production in IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes. Sesamin also inhibited IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and IκBα. Meanwhile, sesamin was found to up-regulate the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1. However, Nrf2 siRNA reversed the anti-inflammatory effects of sesamin. In conclusion, our results suggested that sesamin showed anti-inflammatory effects in IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes by activating Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

MPTP-lesioned (30mg/kg/day, 5days) mice showed deficits in memory including habit learning memory and spatial memory, which were further aggravated by daily treatment with 25mg/kg l-DOPA for 21days. However, daily treatment with (-)-sesamin (25 and 50mg/kg) for 21days ameliorated memory deficits in an MPTP-lesioned mouse model of PD treated with l-DOPA (25mg/kg). Both (-)-sesamin doses reduced decreases in the retention latency time in the passive avoidance test, latency to fall of rotarod test and distance traveled in the open field test, and attenuated decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunopositive cells, dopamine, and its metabolites in the substantia nigra-striatum. (-)-Sesamin reduced increases in the retention transfer latency time in the elevated plus-maze test and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) expression and reduced decreases in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus. In contrast, daily treatment with 10mg/kg l-DOPA for 21days ameliorated memory deficits in MPTP-lesioned mice, and this effect was further improved by treatment with (-)-sesamin (25 and 50mg/kg). These results suggest that (-)-sesamin protects against habit learning memory deficits by activating the dopamine neuronal system, while spatial memory deficits are decreased by its modulatory effects on the NMDAR-ERK1/2-CREB system. Accordingly, (-)-sesamin may act as an adjuvant phytonutrient for motor and memory deficits in patients with PD receiving l-DOPA.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of sesamin supplementation on glycemic status, serum levels of inflammatory markers and adiponectinin patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with type 2 diabetes participated in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: intervention group (sesamin capsules; 200 mg/day, n = 24) and control group (placebo capsules; 200 mg/day starch, n = 24). Anthropometric indices and serum levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and adiponectin were assessed at the baseline and after 8 weeks. RESULT: Sesamin supplementation caused a significant reduction in FBS, HbA1C and TNF-α levels compared with the placebo (p < 0.05). Waist circumference, hip circumference, body adiposity index (BAI), FBS, HbA1c, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels were decreased, and adiponectin levels were increased significantly in the intervention group at the end of study (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the beneficial effects of sesamin supplement on glycemic status and inflammatory factors, it may be considered as a supplementary therapeutic approach for diabetic patients. However, future investigations are needed in this field."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease associated with chronic inflammatory arthritis. TNF-α and OSM are pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a key role in RA progression. Thus, reducing the effects of both cytokines is practical in order to relieve the progression of the disease. This current study is interested in sesamin, an active compound in sesame seeds. Sesamin has been shown to be a chondroprotective agent in osteoarthritis models. Here, we have evaluated a porcine cartilage explant as a cartilage degradation model related to RA induced by TNF-α and/or OSM in order to investigate the effects of sesamin on TNF-α and OSM in the cartilage degradation model. METHODS: A porcine cartilage explant was induced with a combination of TNF-α and OSM (test group) or IL-1β and OSM (control group) followed by a co-treatment of sesamin over a long-term period (35 days). After which, the tested explants were analyzed for indications of both the remaining and the degradation aspects using glycosaminoglycan and collagen as an indicator. RESULTS: The combination of TNF-α and OSM promoted cartilage degradation more than either TNF-α or OSM alone and was comparable with the combination of IL-1β and OSM. Sesamin could be offering protection against cartilage degradation by reducing GAGs and collagen turnover in the generated model. CONCLUSIONS: Sesamin might be a promising agent as an alternative treatment for RA patients. Furthermore, the generated model revealed itself to be an impressive test model for the analysis of phytochemical substances against the cartilage degradation model for RA. The model could be used to test for the prevention of cartilage degradation in other biological agents induced with TNF-α and OSM as well.",

Here, we examine whether sesamin attenuates renal IRI in an animal model and explore the underlying mechanisms. Male mice were subjected to right renal ischemia for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h with sesamin (100 mg/kg) during which the left kidney was removed. Renal damage and function were assessed subsequently. The results showed that sesamin reduced kidney ischemia reperfusion injury, as assessed by decreased serum creatinine (Scr) and Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alleviated tubular damage and apoptosis. In addition, sesamin inhibited neutrophils infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β production in IR-preformed kidney. Notably, sesamin promoted the expression of CD39, A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR), and A2BAR mRNA and protein as well as adenosine production. Furthermore, CD39 inhibitor or A2AR antagonist abolished partly the protection of sesamin in kidney IRI. In conclusion, sesamin could effectively protect kidney from IRI by inhibiting inﬂammatory responses, which might be associated with promoting the adenosine-CD39-A2AR signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the common cause of diabetic vascular complications that leads to the blindness in the working age population throughout the world. Free radicals mediated oxidative stress and inflammation play a significant role in pathophysiology of DR. To find a new and safe drug to treat DR is still challenging and for that purpose the natural compounds may be therapeutic agents. Here we show that sesamin (SES), which is the main component of sesame seed and its oil, and has been reported as potent antioxidant and neuroprotective, could be a therapeutic agent in DR. In the present study, we investigated protective effect of SES in Streptozotocin (STZ) induced DR in mice. The mice were divided into three groups (Control, DR and DR+SES) for the study. After two weeks post-diabetic establishment, mice were treated with SES (30mg/kg BW, i.p, alternate day) for four weeks. Mice body weight and blood glucose level were measured from each group. The microglial activation of retina was determined by immunohistochemistry analysis by using Iba-1 as a microglia marker. Retinal mRNA levels of Iba-1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1) were examined by qRT-PCR. The level of iNOS protein expression was examined by immunoblotting. Together these data demonstrate that SES treatment lowered the progression of diabetic retinal injury by: 1) decreasing blood glucose level, 2) suppressing microglia activation, 3) reducing retinal TNF-α and ICAM-1 levels and 4) quenching iNOS expression. In conclusion, the results suggest that SES treatment may be of therapeutic benefit in reducing the progression of DR by ameliorating hyperglycemia and inflammation in diabetic retina.",

Sesamin, a bioactive component extracted from sesame, has been reported to exert chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we analyzed the anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic effects of sesamin on rat IVD in vitro and ex vivo. Results show that sesamin significantly inhibits the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of catabolic enzymes (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5) and inflammation factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS, NO, COX-2, PGE2) in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. It is also proven that migration of macrophages induced by LPS can be inhibited by treatment with sesamin. Organ culture experiments demonstrate that sesamin protects the IVD from LPS-induced depletion of the extracellular matrix ex vivo. Moreover, sesamin suppresses LPS-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through inhibiting phosphorylation of JNK, the common downstream signaling pathway of LPS and IL-1β, which may be the potential mechanism of the effects of sesamin. In light of our results, sesamin protects the IVD from inflammation and extracellular matrix catabolism, presenting positive prospects in the treatment of IVD degenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Hepatorenal toxicities are an important side effect of anthracycline antibiotics. The objective of this study was to determine whether sesamin (Ses) protects against acute doxorubicin (DOX)-induced hepatorenal toxicities. Rats received daily treatment with either 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (10 mL/kg) or Ses (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) orally for 10 days, followed by an intravenous injection at day 8 of either saline (10 mL/kg) or DOX (20 mg/kg). Hepatorenal toxicity was assessed by measuring the levels of serum creatinine (Cre), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The protein expression of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in hepatorenal tissues was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content and antioxidant activity in the kidney and liver tissues were also measured. The results suggest that pretreatment with Ses ameliorated DOX-induced liver and kidney injury by lowering the serum ALT, AST, ALP, Cre and BUN levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), and the histological damage to the liver and kidney tissues induced by DOX compared to control were also significantly attenuated by Ses. Furthermore, Ses significantly decreased the DOX-induced increase of MDA and 4-HNE and increased the activity of CAT, SOD and GPX compared to the DOX-treated rats (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), whereas the change of DOX + Ses (10 mg/kg) group is not significant compared to the DOX-treated group (p > 0.05). These findings indicate that Ses elicits a typical protective effect against DOX-induced acute hepatorenal toxicity via the suppression of oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "Establishing therapeutic agents for the treatment of allergic diseases is an important focus of human health research. Sesamin, a lignan in sesame oil, exhibits a diverse range of pharmacological properties. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of sesamin on mast cell‑mediated allergic responses has not yet been investigated. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of sesamin on mast cell‑mediated allergic responses and the underlying mechanisms by which it produces this effect. In rats, oral administration of sesamin inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Sesamin exposure attenuated immunoglobulin E‑induced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, which was indicated to be mediated by the modulation of intracellular calcium. In human mast cells, sesamin reduced the stimulatory effects of phorbol 12‑myristate 13‑acetate and calcium ionophore A23187 on the production and secretion of pro‑inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin‑6. The inhibitory effect of sesamin on pro‑inflammatory cytokine production was dependent on nuclear factor κ‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated B cells (NF‑κB) and p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK). The present study demonstrates that sesamin inhibits mast cell‑derived inflammatory allergic reactions by blocking histamine release, and pro‑inflammatory cytokine production and secretion. In addition, the findings indicate that the effect of sesamin is mediated by its effect on p38 MAPK/NF‑κB signaling. Furthermore, the in vivo and in vitro anti‑allergic effects of sesamin reported in the present study suggest that it is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory allergic diseases.",

      "abstract": "In 2009, swine flu (H1N1) had spread significantly to levels that threatened pandemic influenza. There have been many treatments that have arisen for patients since the WHO first reported the disease. Although some progress in controlling influenza has taken place during the last few years, the disease is not yet under control. The development of new and less expensive anti-influenza drugs is still needed. Here, we show that sesamin from the seeds of the Thai medicinal plant Sesamum indicum has anti-inflammatory cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) induced by 2009 influenza virus type A H1N1. In this study, the combinatorial screening method combined with the computational approach was applied to investigate the new molecular binding structures of sesamin against the 2009 influenza virus type A H1N1 (p09N1) crystallized structure. Experimental methods were applied to propose the mechanisms of sesamin against cytokine production from H1N1-induced human PBMC model. The molecular dynamics simulation of sesamin binding with the p09N1 crystallized structure showed new molecular binding structures at ARG118, ILE222, ARG224, and TYR406, and it has been proposed that sesamin could potentially be used to produce anti-H1N1 compounds. Furthermore, the mechanisms of sesamin against cytokine production from influenza type A H1N1-induced PBMCs by ELISA and signaling transduction showed that sesamin exhibits the ability to inhibit proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, and to enhance the activity of the immune cell cytokine IL-2 via downregulating the phosphorylated JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways. This information might very well be useful in the prevention and treatment of immune-induced inflammatory disorders.",

      "abstract": "Sesamin, a major lignan derived from sesame seeds, has been reported to have many benefits and medicinal properties. However, its protective effects against fluoride-induced injury in kidney of fish have not been clarified. Previously we found that fluoride exposure caused damage and apoptosis in the kidneys of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio. In this study, the effects of sesamin on renal oxidative stress and apoptosis in fluoride-exposed fish were determined. The results showed that sesamin alleviated significantly fluoride-induced renal damage and apoptosis of carp in a dose-dependent manner, indicated by the histopathological examination and ultrastructural observation. Moreover, treatment with sesamin also inhibited significantly fluoride-induced remarkable enhancement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress, such as the increase of lipid peroxidation level and the depletion of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) level in kidney. To explore the underlying mechanisms of sesamin action, we found that activities of caspase-3 were notably inhibited by treatment with sesamin in the kidney of fluoride-exposed fish. Sesamin decreased the levels of p-JNK protein in kidney, which in turn inactivated pro-apoptotic signaling events by restoring the balance between mitochondrial pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bax proteins and by decreasing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in kidney of fluoride-exposed fish. JNK was also involved in the mitochondrial extrinsic apoptotic pathways of sesamin effects against fluoride-induced renal injury by regulating the levels of p-c-Jun, necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Bak proteins. These findings indicated that sesamin could protect kidney against fluoride-induced apoptosis by the oxidative stress downstream-mediated change in the inactivation of JNK signaling pathway. Taken together, sesamin plays an important role in maintaining renal health and preventing kidney from toxic damage induced by fluoride.",

      "abstract": "NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Our aim was to examine whether sesamin can prevent a decline in exercise capacity in high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice. Our hypothesis was that maintenance of mitochondrial function and attenuation of oxidative stress in the skeletal muscle would contribute to this result. What is the main finding and its importance? The new findings are that sesamin prevents the diabetes-induced decrease in exercise capacity and impairment of mitochondrial function through the inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent oxidative stress in the skeletal muscle. Sesamin may be useful as a novel agent for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. ABSTRACT: We previously reported that exercise capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in diabetic mice were impaired, in association with the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase. It has been reported that sesamin inhibits NAD(P)H oxidase-induced superoxide production. Therefore, we examined whether the antioxidant sesamin could prevent a decline in exercise capacity in mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes. C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD, then treated or not with sesamin (0.2%) to yield the following four groups: ND, ND+Sesamin, HFD and HFD+Sesamin (n = 10 each). After 8 weeks, body weight, fat weight, blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, total cholesterol and fatty acid were significantly increased in HFD compared with ND mice. Sesamin prevented the increases in blood insulin and lipid levels in HFD-fed mice, but did not affect the plasma glucose. Exercise capacity determined by treadmill tests was significantly reduced in HFD mice, but almost completely recovered in HFD+Sesamin mice. Citrate synthase activity was significantly decreased in the skeletal muscle of HFD mice, and these decreases were also inhibited by sesamin. Superoxide anion and NAD(P)H oxidase activity were significantly increased in HFD mice compared with the ND mice and were ameliorated by sesamin. Sesamin prevented the decline in exercise capacity in HFD-induced diabetic mice via maintenance of mitochondrial function, fat oxidation and attenuation of oxidative stress in the skeletal muscle. Our data suggest that sesamin may be useful as a novel agent for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.",

Oxidative stress has a critical role in the pathogenesis of RA and CVD. Sesamin, the main lignin constituent of sesame, has several antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to investigate the effects of sesamin supplementation on anthropometric indices, lipid profile, blood pressure, and oxidative stress markers in women with RA. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 44 patients with RA were randomly divided into 2 groups (intervention and control). Patients consumed 200 mg/day sesamin supplement and placebo in the intervention and control groups, respectively, for 6 weeks (spring 2014). At baseline and at the end of the study, anthropometric indices and blood pressure were assessed. Serum concentrations of lipid profile, malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were also determined. RESULTS: At the end of study, sesamin supplementation significantly decreased serum levels of MDA (p = 0.018) and increased TAC and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in patients with RA (p = 0.020 and p = 0.007, respectively). In the sesamin group, the mean of weight, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, body fat, systolic blood pressure, and the concentration of other lipid profiles (triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) were also significantly decreased at the end of study compared to baseline values (p < 0.05). However, the difference between the 2 groups was not statistically significant in this regard (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Sesamin exhibited a protective effect on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with RA. However, further investigation is suggested.",

Sesamin has been demonstrated to possess antioxidative activity. This study was designed to investigate whether sesamin protects against AGEs-evoked β-cell damage via its antioxidant property. The effects of sesamin were examined in C57BL/6J mice and MIN6 cell line. In in vivo studies, mice were intraperitoneally injected with AGEs (120 mg/kg) and orally treated with sesamin (160 mg/kg) for four weeks. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance and insulin releasing tests were performed. Insulin content, ROS generation and β-cell apoptosis in pancreatic islets were also measured. In in vitro studies, MIN6 cells were pretreated with sesamin (50 or 100 μM) and then exposed to AGEs (200 mg/L) for 24 h. Insulin secretion, β-cell death, ROS production as well as expression and activity of NADPH oxidase were determined. Sesamin treatment obviously ameliorated AGE-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. These effects were associated with decreased ROS production, down-regulated expression of p67(phox) and p22(phox), and reduced NADPH oxidase activity. These results suggest that sesamin protects β-cells from damage caused by AGEs through suppressing NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The blood pressure lowering effect of sesamin has been demonstrated to be associated with the increase in vascular nitric oxide (NO) biological activity by our previous studies and others. The present study was designed to explore the underlying mechanisms involved in the effect of sesamin on aortic NO bioactivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). METHODS: Sesamin was orally administered for 8 consecutive weeks in SHRs. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using the tail-cuff method. The aortas were isolated and in vitro vascular reactivity studies were performed. Superoxide anion production in carotid arteries was assessed by dihydroethidium fluorescence staining. The protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS (P-eNOS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase subunit p47phox, and copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) in aortas was detected by Western blotting. The dimeric form of eNOS in aortas was determined by low-temperature sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Aortic level of nitrotyrosine and activities of antioxidant enzymes, namely, total SOD (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase were also detected. RESULTS: In SHRs, sesamin treatment reduced SBP, improved vascular relaxation induced by acetylcholine and enhanced aortic NO bioactivity. Sesamin treatment enhanced NO biosynthesis in SHR aortas was due to upregulated P-eNOS and suppressed eNOS uncoupling, and the latter effect might be attributed to decreased nitrotyrosine and upregulated DHFR. Sesamin also reduced the NO oxidative inactivation and decreased the superoxide anion production through downregulation of p47(phox) and amelioration of eNOS uncoupling. In addition, sesamin treatment did not alter the levels of GPx and catalase activity but obviously reduced the compensatory elevated T-SOD activity and Cu/Zn-SOD protein expression. CONCLUSION: Chronic treatment with sesamin could reduce hypertension and improve endothelial dysfunction through enhancement of NO bioactivity in SHR aortas.",

Results showed that sesamin dose-dependently (1, 10 and 50 μM) reduced the cell viability and increased LDH release and apoptosis (TUNEL assay). In addition, there was a significant increase of sub-G1 phase arrest in the cell cycle after sesamin treatment.

In PC12 cells, treatment with (-)-sesamin (25 µM) reduced 6-OHDA (100 µM)-induced cell death and induced transient extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 (BadSer112). In contrast, sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2) phosphorylation, and cleaved-caspase-3 activity, all of which were induced by 6-OHDA (100 µM), were inhibited by treatment with (-)-sesamin (25 µM). Furthermore, co-treatment with (-)-sesamin (30 mg/kg, p.o.) once a day for 28 days significantly increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunopositive neuronal cells and the levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid in the substantia nigra-striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of PD with or without L-DOPA treatment. These results suggest that (-)-sesamin protects 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity via the activation of transient ERK1/2-BadSer112 system and the inhibition of sustained ERK-p38MAPK-JNK1/2-caspase-3 system in PC12 cells.

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of sesamin on streptozotocin (STZ) induced apoptosis in INS-1 cells and the possible mechanisms implicated. After preincubation with indicated concentrations of sesamin (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0μmol/l) for 24h, INS-1 cells were exposed to STZ (3mmol/l) for 12h. Sesamin effectively improved STZ induced cell damage as determined by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide] assay and insulin secretion capacity, and suppressed STZ induced cell apoptosis as evaluated by flow cytometry using annexin V and propidium iodide double staining. Western blot analysis demonstrated that sesamin markedly suppressed STZ induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation, with Bax protein down-regulated and Bcl-2 protein up-regulated significantly. Preincubation with sesamin resulted in an evident enhancement of total antioxidant capacity in INS-1 cells, accompanied by a significant reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, an end product of lipid peroxidation. Taken together, these findings suggested that sesamin was capable of suppressing STZ induced INS-1 cell apoptosis, which might be ascribed, at least partly, to the inhibition of NF-κB activation and subsequent regulation of Bcl-2 family protein expression. This study would provide a potential target for treatment of diabetes with sesamin as well as other antioxidants.",

The present study was designed to evaluate molecular mechanism by which sesamin (SES) induces neuroprotection in mouse model of ischemic stroke. The results of this study demonstrate that SES treatment (30 mg/kg bwt) significantly reduced infarction volume, lipid per-oxidation, cleaved-caspase-3 activation, and increased GSH activity following MCAO in adult male mouse. SES treatment also diminished iNOS and COX-2 protein expression, and significantly restored SOD activity and protein expression level in the ischemic cortex of the MCAO animals. Furthermore, SES treatment also significantly reduced inflammatory and oxidative stress markers including Iba1, Nox-2, Cox-2, peroxynitrite compared to placebo MCAO animals. Superoxide radical production, as studied by DHE staining method, was also significantly reduced in the ischemic cortex of SES treated compared to placebo MCAO animals. Likewise, downstream effects of superoxide free radicals i.e. MAPK/ERK and P38 activation was also significantly attenuated in SES treated compared to placebo MCAO animals. In conclusion, these results suggest that SES induces significant neuroprotection, by ameliorating many signaling pathways activated/deactivated following cerebral ischemia in adult mouse.",

      "abstract": "Sesamin is a major component in lignans of sesame seed oil, known to possess potent anti-oxidative capacity. In this study, the variation of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a kind of anti-oxidative enzyme, by sesamin in murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 cells was investigated. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10μg/ml) exposure tended to increase HO-1 protein expression. Co-treatment with 100μM sesamin for 12h up-regulated the HO-1 protein level increased by LPS; however, HO-1 mRNA was unaffected. Sesamin delayed the reversal, by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (1μM), of the LPS-induced increase of HO-1 protein level. Meanwhile, sesamin suppressed LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) protein and associated NO release. LPS-induced increase of iNOS protein expression was also reversed by cycloheximide, which was not affected by sesamin, unlike HO-1. To clarify the mechanisms that underlie the up-regulation of HO-1 protein level by sesamin, the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cell line transfected with Flag-tagged HO-1 was used. A proteasome inhibitor, MG-132 (10μM), stabilized HO-1 protein in HEK 293T cells. Co-treatment with sesamin decreased ubiquitinated HO-1 protein accumulation by MG-132. However, sesamin did not affect the proteasome activity. These findings suggest that sesamin disturbs the degradation of HO-1 protein through inhibiting its ubiquitination, resulting in HO-1 protein up-regulation.",

Sesamin, a food-derived agent, possesses anti-cancer activities both in vitro and in vivo. The present study was designed to determine whether sesamin also have effects on cancer stem-like SP cells from gallbladder cancer (GBC). METHODS: In this study, we sorted SP cells by flow cytometry. SP cells were cultured and treated with sesamin. Tumor-sphere formation, colony formation, Matrigel invasion and tumorigenic potential were determined. Expression of nuclear NF-κB, IL-6, p-Stat3, Twist, E-cadherin and Vimentin was measured by Western blot, immunofluorescence staining or RT-PCR analysis. Nuclear NF-κB activity and IL-6 protein level were assessed with ELISA. Xenograft tumors were generated in nude mice. RESULTS: After treated with sesamin, SP cells differentiated into cells expressing the epithelial marker (E-cadherin). Sesamin effectively affected SP cells stem cell-like characteristics (i.e., tumor-sphere formation, colony-formation, Matrigel invasion), weakened the drug-resistance of SP cells and inhibited tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with sesamin significantly reduced the expression of nuclear NF-κB, IL-6, p-Stat3, Twist and Vimentin (a mesenchymal marker) in SP cells. Nuclear NF-κB activity and IL-6 level were also decreased after treatment with sesamin. CONCLUSION: Food-derived sesamin directs the epithelial differentiation of cancer stem-like SP cells from GBC, which is associated with attenuation of NF-κB-IL-6-Stat3-Twist signal pathway.",

Sesamin is an active constituent of Sesamum indicum which has been shown to possess multiple pharmacological activities. In this work, we investigated the effects of sesamin on foam cell formation and cholesterol efflux in RAW264.7 macrophages. Sesamin dose-dependently inhibited the enhanced cholesterol accumulation elicited by oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (oxLDL) in RAW264.7 cells. Treatment with sesamin (10 μM) significantly enhanced cholesterol efflux mediated by high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Realtime quantitative PCR and luciferase assays showed that sesamin significantly increased the mRNA levels of PPARγ, LXRα, and ABCG1, and increased the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. The stimulating effect of sesamin on cholesterol efflux was substantially inhibited by the co-treatment with GW9662, a potent inhibitor of PPARγ. These results suggest that sesamin is a new inhibitor of foam cell formation that may stimulate cholesterol efflux through upregulation of the PPARγ-LXRα-ABCG1 pathway.",

The first and second phases of the time paw licking were inhibited by sesame oil and sesamin (100, 200, or 400 mg/kg).

Considering the tail-immersion assay, the sesame oil and sesamin produced significant effect after 60 min at the doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg. After 4 h of application of the carrageenan, the sesame oil and sesamin were effective against the paw edema. The exudate volume and leucocyte migration were also reduced by sesame oil and sesamin.

      "abstract": "(-)-Sesamin is a lignan present in sesam oil and a number of medicinal plants. It exerts various pharmacological effects, such as prevention of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and carcinogenesis. Moreover, (-)-sesamin has chemopreventive and anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Multidrug resistance (MDR) of tumors leads to fatal treatment outcome in many patients and novel drugs able to kill multidrug-resistant cells are urgently needed. P-glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1) is the best known ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporter mediating MDR. ABCB5 is a close relative to ABCB1, which also mediates MDR. We found that the mRNA expressions of ABCB1 and ABCB5 were not related to the 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50) for (-)-sesamin in a panel of 55 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute, USA. Furthermore, (-)-sesamin inhibited ABCB1- or ABCB5-overexpressing cells with similar efficacy than their drug-sensitive parental counterparts. In addition to ABC transporter-mediated MDR, we attempted to identify other molecular determinants of (-)-sesamin resistance. For this reason, we performed COMPARE and hierarchical cluster analyses of the transcriptome-wide microarray-based mRNA expression of the NCI cell panel. Twenty-three genes were identified, whose mRNA expression correlated with the IC50 values for (-)-sesamin. These genes code for proteins of different biological functions, i.e. ribosomal proteins, components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, proteins involved in RNA metabolism, protein biosynthesis, or glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Subjecting this set of genes to cluster analysis showed that the cell lines were assembled in the resulting dendrogram according to their responsiveness to (-)-sesamin. In conclusion, (-)-sesamin is not involved in MDR mediated by ABCB1 or ABCB5 and may be valuable to bypass chemoresistance of refractory tumors. The microarray expression profile, which predicted sensitivity or resistance of tumor cells to (-)-sesamin consisted of genes, which do not belong to the classical resistance mechanisms to established anticancer drugs.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Nutritional control has been proposed as a potential therapy for slowing the senescence of immune function and decreasing mortality. This study investigated whether sesamin could modify host defense systems and extend the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. METHODS: Nematodes were fed standard food (the bacterium Escherichia coli strain OP50) supplemented with various doses of sesamin/γ-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds starting from young adulthood. The mean lifespan, muscle function, lipofuscin accumulation, protein carbonyl content, and stress resistance of the worms were examined. Then, C. elegans mutants harboring loss-of-function lesions in longevity- and host defense-related signaling pathways were supplemented with sesamin to identify the genes involved in the longevity effects. RESULTS: Worms supplemented with sesamin displayed higher locomotion and prolongevity and produced offspring at levels similar to unsupplemented control animals. The growth curves of nematodes were similar to those of controls, suggesting that sesamin did not induce prolongevity effects through dietary restriction. Notably, sesamin made the worms more resistant to infection by Legionella pneumophila and more resistant to oxidative stressors such as paraquat and hydrogen peroxide and prolonged the lifespan of a mev-1 mutant that produces abundant superoxide anions. However, the accumulation of protein carbonyls and lipofuscin was similar in sesamin-exposed and control worms, suggesting that sesamin is unlikely to work simply as an antioxidant. Sesamin supplementation failed to extend the lifespan of loss-of-function mutants of daf-2, daf-16, pmk-1, and skn-1. CONCLUSIONS: Sesamin enhances the host defense of C. elegans and increases the average lifespan via activation of both skn-1 (encoding a component of the p38 MAPK pathway) and daf-16 (encoding a component of the IGF-1 pathway).",

However, its protective effects against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced injury in liver have not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of sesamin on oxidative stress and apoptosis in mice exposed to CCl4. Our data showed that sesamin significantly prevented CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, indicated by both diagnostic indicators of liver damage (serum aminotransferase activities) and histopathological analysis. Moreover, CCl4-induced profound elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress, as evidenced by increasing of lipid peroxidation level and depleting of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in liver, were suppressed by treatment with sesamin. Furthermore, TUNEL assay showed that CCl4-induced apoptosis in mouse liver was significantly inhibited by sesamin. In exploring the underlying mechanisms of sesamin action, we found that activities of caspase-3 were markedly inhibited by the treatment of sesamin in the liver of CCl4 treated mice. Sesamin increased expression levels of phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in liver, which in turn inactivated pro-apoptotic signaling events restoring the balance between mitochondrial pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and decreasing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in liver of CCl4 treated mice. JNK was also involved in the mitochondrial extrinsic apoptotic pathways of sesamin effects against CCl4 induced liver injury by regulating the expression levels of phosphorylated c-Jun proteins, necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Bak. In conclusion, these results suggested that the inhibition of CCl4-induced apoptosis by sesamin is due at least in part to its anti-oxidant activity and its ability to modulate the JNK signaling pathway.",
