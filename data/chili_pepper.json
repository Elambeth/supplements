      "abstract": "Odor-induced saltiness enhancement (OISE) is thought to be a unique salt reduction technique which capitalizes on olfactory-gustatory interaction. Volatile compounds of stewed duck obtained from orthonasal (no-treatment) and retronasal (saliva-treatment) pathways and their capacity on OISE were analyzed by GC-O-MS and molecular simulation in order to ascertain the role of odors in duck stewed with chili pepper on saltiness enhancement. Totally 17 unique volatile compounds were identified in retronasal pathways. Eight salty-congruent volatile compounds were screened from the stewed duck, one of which being E-2-decenal, specific to retronasal volatile compounds following oral enzymatic digestion. These volatile compounds' OISE in NaCl solution was confirmed, and the retronasal pathway effect outweighed the orthonasal one. Molecular docking revealed that volatile compounds interacted with saltiness receptors through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic force, which may be responsible for its enhanced saltiness. These findings suggest that olfactory pathways and specific odors might simultaneously mediate OISE.",

The present case-control study aimed to assess the risk factors of fissure-associated fistulas due to the limited available evidence. METHODS: Patients with fissure-associated fistulas were considered as case, and patients with anal fissure who were undergoing medical treatment without any previous anorectal surgeries were considered as control group. Data were collected through medical records or by directly contacting patients. Risk factors of fissure-associated fistulas were assessed using a multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The current study included 119 patients, consisting of 54 cases and 65 controls. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of demographic characteristics. Our analyses revealed that chili pepper consumption (odds ratio [OR] = 2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-8.31, P-value = 0.039) and the duration of fissure symptoms (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.05, P-value = 0.035) were associated with perianal fistula in patients with fissure, after adjusting for age and sex as potential covariates. CONCLUSIONS: An independent association was found between chili pepper consumption as well as the duration of fissure symptoms onset with an increased odds of perianal fistula in patients with fissures. Therefore, limiting chili consumption and early management of fissure symptoms are recommended."

      "abstract": "Salinity stress can significantly delay plant growth. It can disrupt water and nutrient uptake, reducing crop yields and poor plant health. The use of strigolactone can be an effective technique to overcome this issue. Strigolactone enhances plant growth by promoting root development and improvement in physiological attributes. The current pot study used strigolactone to amend chili under no salinity and salinity stress environments. There were four treatments, i.e., 0, 10µM strigolactone, 20µM strigolactone and 30µM strigolactone. All treatments were applied in four replications following a completely randomized design (CRD). Results showed that 20µM strigolactone caused a significant increase in chili plant height (21.07%), dry weight (33.60%), fruit length (19.24%), fruit girth (35.37%), and fruit yield (60.74%) compared to control under salinity stress. Significant enhancement in chili chlorophyll a (18.65%), chlorophyll b (43.52%), and total chlorophyll (25.09%) under salinity stress validated the effectiveness of 20µM strigolactone application as treatment over control. Furthermore, improvement in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium concentration in leaves confirmed the efficient functioning of 20µM strigolactone compared to other concentrations under salinity stress. The study concluded that 20µM strigolactone is recommended for mitigating salinity stress in chili plants. Growers are advised to apply 20µM strigolactone to enhance their chili production under salinity stress.",

      "abstract": "Cancer profoundly influences morbidity and fatality rates worldwide. Patients often have dismal prognoses despite recent improvements in cancer therapy regimens. However, potent biomolecules derived from natural sources, including medicinal and dietary plants, contain biological and pharmacological properties to prevent and treat various human malignancies. Capsaicin is a bioactive phytocompound present in red hot chili peppers. Capsaicin has demonstrated many biological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticarcinogenic capabilities. This review highlights the cellular and molecular pathways through which capsaicin exhibits antineoplastic activities. Our work also depicts the synergistic anticancer properties of capsaicin in conjunction with other natural bioactive components and approved anticancer drugs. Capsaicin inhibits proliferation in various cancerous cells, and its antineoplastic actions in numerous in vitro and in vivo carcinoma models impact oncogenesis, tumor-promoting and suppressor genes, and associated signaling pathways. Capsaicin alone or combined with other phytocompounds or approved antineoplastic drugs triggers cell cycle progression arrest, generating reactive oxygen species and disrupting mitochondrial membrane integrity, ultimately stimulating caspases and promoting death. Furthermore, capsaicin alone or in combination can promote apoptosis in carcinoma cells by enhancing the p53 and c-Myc gene expressions. In conclusion, capsaicin alone or in combination can have enormous potential for cancer prevention and intervention, but further high-quality studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of this phytocompound.",

      "abstract": "Red chili pepper is a beneficial natural spicy food that has antiobesity and antitype II diabetes effects, but it is not conducive to in-depth research as a dietary strategy to treat obesity. This study aims to investigate the beneficial effects of red chili pepper, fermented with a novel Lactococcus lactis subs. cremoris RPG-HL-0136. LC-MS/MS analysis is conducted to detect the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, and no significant difference is observed between the nonfermented red chili pepper (NFP) (W/W) and the prepared L. lactis subs. cremoris RPG-HL-0136-fermented chili mixture (LFP). After establishing a high-fat diet-induced obese type II diabetic mouse model, the effects on weight gain, weight loss of liver and testicular fat, total cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance in LFP were evaluated to be better than those in NFP following 10 weeks of interventions. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Xinxiang medical university. NFP and LFP could increase the expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and caspase-2 in the high-fat mice. Compared with unfermented red chili pepper, the fermented red chili pepper complex significantly reduced LPS, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 in serum (P < .05). Intake of LFP significantly increased the expression of claudin-1 and occludin in the colon of the high-fat mice (P < .05), and there was no damage to the stomach and colon. This study provides scientific evidence that red chili pepper, fermented with L. lactis subs. cremoris RPG-HL-0136, may be beneficial for future treatment of obesity and accompanying diabetes.

Therefore, nanoparticles (NPs) and plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) have been proposed as viable strategies to obtain better crop yields with less environmental impact. Here, we describe the effect of silica nanoparticles (SiO2-NPs) on survival, antioxidant enzymatic activity, phosphate solubilization capacity, and gibberellin production of Bacillus cereus-Amazcala (B.c-A). Moreover, the effect of the co-application of SiO2-NPs and B.c-A on seed germination, physiological characteristics, and antioxidant enzymatic activity of chili pepper plants was investigated under greenhouse conditions. The results indicated that SiO2-NPs at 100 ppm enhanced the role of B.c-A as PGPB by increasing its phosphate solubilization capacity and the production of GA7. Moreover, B.c-A catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were increased with SiO2-NPs 100 ppm treatment, indicating that SiO2-NPs act as a eustressor, inducing defense-related responses. The co-application of SiO2-NPs 100 ppm and B.c-A improved chili pepper growth. There was an increase in seed germination percentage, plant height, number of leaves, and number and yield of fruits. There was also an increase in CAT and PAL activities in chili pepper plants, indicating that bacteria-NP treatment induces plant immunity."

      "abstract": "Capsaicinoids are the main bioactive compounds extracted from chili pepper seeds (CPSs) but other bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds may be found. Enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE) improves the extraction of bioactive compounds from fruits and seeds. The aim of this study was to establish the cellulase-assisted extraction conditions of capsaicinoids and phenolic compounds from Habanero CPSs (Capsicum chinense) and to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the obtained extracts on murine macrophages. EAE was performed using different temperatures (T1 = 30°C, T2 = 45°C and T3 = 60°C), enzyme concentrations (E1 = 2,500 UI/L and E2 = 250 UI/L), and extraction time periods (0-150 min). Total phenolic compounds were quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, capsaicin (CAP) and dihydrocapsaicin (DHC) contents were evaluated by HPLC, and anti-inflammatory activity was performed with Griess assay on murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell culture. The highest phenolic compound content (337.96 mg GAE/L) was achieved at 30°C, 2,500 UI/L, and 150 min of extraction. The highest CAP content (310.23 μg/ml) was obtained at 45°C with 250 UI/L for 150 min, while for DHC (167.72 μg/ml), the conditions were 60°C, 2,500 UI/L, and 120 min. The highest anti-inflammatory response was obtained when 60°C, E2, and 150 min were used for the extraction, and nitric oxide (NO) production was reduced to 22.56%. Based on the results obtained in this research, EAE allowed the recovery of compounds with anti-inflammatory activity from CPS using water as a solvent. There was a correlation between the extraction of CAP and DHC. But although a moderate direct correlation between the concentration of capsaicinoids and total phenolic compounds (TPCs) and an inverse correlation of the presence of the bioactive compounds (TPC, CAP, and DHC) with the NO synthesis, these were not statistically significant. We demonstrated that Habanero seeds are an important raw material to recover anti-inflammatory compounds beyond capsaicinoids using water in EAE."

      "abstract": "A burning sensation on eating spicy foods purportedly supports the role of capsaicin, an active component of chili peppers, in the etiology of oral submucous fibrosis (OSF). Although the mast cell mediators and activated P2X receptors induce a constant burning sensation through an ATP-dependent mechanism, it is the activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV-1) receptor by capsaicin that aggravates it. The molecular basis for the burning pain in OSF is thus attributable to the activation of TRPV1. There is overwhelming evidence that confirms capsaicin has more of a protective role in attenuating fibrosis and is potentially therapeutic in reversing conditions linked to collagen accumulation. The activation of TRPV-1 by capsaicin increases intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), upregulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1), to enrich endothelium-dependent vasodilation via endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The induction of vasodilation induces antifibrotic effects by alleviating hypoxia. The antifibrotic effects of capsaicin are mediated through the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, downregulation of inflammatory genes and suppression of new collagen fibril formation. Capsaicin also demonstrates an anticarcinogenic effect by upregulating the cytotoxic T cells and downregulating regulatory T cells through the inhibition of angiogenesis and promotion of apoptosis. Judicious administration of capsaicin with an appropriate delivery mechanism may have therapeutic benefits in reducing pain sensation, rendering antifibrotic effects, and preventing the malignant transformation of OSF. This paper provides an overview of the molecular basis of capsaicin and its therapeutic application as an antifibrotic and anticarcinogenic agent for the treatment of OSF."

      "abstract": "Capsaicin, a major ingredient in chili pepper, has broad pharmaceutical applications, including relieving pain, anti-inflammation, and treating psoriasis. In dermatological biology, capsaicin has been shown to prevent the ultraviolet (UV)-induced melanogenesis via TRPV1 receptor. To strengthen the roles of capsaicin in skin function, the damaged skin, triggered by exposure to UV, was reversed by capsaicin in both in vitro and in vivo models. In cultured dermal fibroblasts, the exposure to UV induced a decrease of collagen synthesis and increases expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and phosphorylation of Erk and c-Jun, and these events subsequently led to skin damage. However, the UV-mediated damages could be reversed by pre-treatment with capsaicin in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of capsaicin in blocking the UV-mediated collagen synthesis was mediated by reducing generation of ROS in dermal fibroblasts, instead of the receptor for capsaicin. Hence, capsaicin has high potential value in applying as an agent for anti-skin aging in dermatology."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the effects of different concentrations of 1-methyl cyclopropene (1-MCP) on the nutritional quality, antioxidant enzyme activities, and volatile compounds of \"Hangjiao No.2\" chili pepper during 12 days of storage at ambient temperature. The chili fruit were randomly selected and divided into four groups corresponding to the four treatments, thus, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 μl L-1 1-MCP and a control. The analysis of the nutritional value, enzyme activities, and volatile compounds were determined at 3 days interval. The results showed that the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was lower in the fruit treated with 1-MCP compared to the control. The treatment with 1.5 μl L-1 and the control showed the lowest superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity compared to the other treatments. Peroxidase (POD) and Catalase (CAT) were highest in the fruit treated with 0.5 μl L-1 compared to the control and treatment with 1.0 μl L-1. The 1.5 μl L-1 treatment delayed the decline in vitamin C and protein content compared to the control. Nitrate levels increased 1.34-fold at 0.5 μl L-1 and 2.01-fold in the control. Chlorophyll content degradation was delayed at 1.0 μl L-1 compared to the control. A total of 88 volatile compounds, including terpenes, aldehydes, alkanes, esters, alcohols, acids, phenolic derivatives, ketones, and other aromatic compounds, were detected in \"Hangjiao No.2\" pepper during the 12-day storage period and treatment concentrations. The production of volatile terpenes was higher in the control than in the 1-MCP treatments, while the 0.5 μl L-1 1-MCP treatment generally suppressed the production of volatile compounds during storage. Overall, the production of volatile compounds after treatment was higher in the \"Hangjiao No.2\" chili fruit treated with 1.0 μl L-1 1-MCP than in the other treatments throughout the storage period. The results indicate that 1-MCP treatment was more effective in maintaining fruit quality, enhancing the activities of SOD, POD, and CAT, retarding the accumulation of MDA and restoring volatile aromas, with 1.0 μl L-1 having the best preservative effect on \"Hangjiao No.2\" chili fruit during storage, which could be useful for future marketing and processing."

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the possible effects of two SBA nano-structured silica materials differing in morphology; SBA-15, with porous structure in parallel and with a highly ordered hexagonal array and SBA-16, with spheric nano-cages located in cubic arrays, as plant growth promoters/eustressors on chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) during cultivation under greenhouse conditions. The study was carried out at three foliarly applied concentrations (20, 50 and 100 ppm) of either SBA materials to determine effects on seed germination, seedling growth, plant performance and cold tolerance under greenhouse. Phytotoxicity tests were carried out using higher concentrations (100, 1000 and 200 ppm) applied by dipping or spraying onto chili pepper plants. Deionized water controls were included. The results showed that the SBA materials did not affect seed germination; however, SBA-15 at 50 ppm and 100 ppm applied by imbibition significantly increased seedling height (up to 8-fold) and provided enhanced growth performance in comparison with controls under select treatment regimes. Weekly application of SBA-15 at 20 ppm significantly increased stem diameter and cold tolerance; however, SBA-16 showed significant decreases in plant height (20 ppm biweekly applied) and stem diameter (20, 50 and 100 ppm biweekly applied). The results demonstrate that both SBA materials provided hormetic effects in a dose dependent manner on chili pepper production and protection to cold stress. No phytotoxic response was evident. These findings suggested the nanostructured mesoporous silica have potential as a sustainable amendment strategy to increase crop production under stress-inducing cultivation conditions."

      "abstract": "Background: Chili pepper has been used for the treatment and prevention of multiple diseases. This may be due to its abundance of bioactive components, such as carotenoids, which are well known for their antioxidant properties. To date, several prospective cohort studies have examined the association between chili pepper intake and mortality, but the results have not been consistent. This study aimed to clarify the association between chili pepper intake and all-cause and disease-specific mortality using a meta-analysis. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and ISI Web of Science databases were searched up to December 20, 2020, and reference lists of included studies were manually reviewed. All prospective cohort studies on the association between chili pepper intake and all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD)-specific, and cancer-specific mortality were included in this study. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in the meta-analysis. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic and Q test. Results: A total of 4 cohort studies (N=564,748; all four studies had adjusted for important potential confounders such as demographic variables, dietary intake, and physical activity) were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. Among them, 31,527 died due to all causes, 10,184 died due to CVD, and 9,868 died due to cancer. Compared to none or rare consumption of chili pepper, consumption of chili pepper (ever or more than once a week) could significantly reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (summary adjusted HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.90), CVD-specific mortality (summary adjusted HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.93), and cancer-specific mortality (summary adjusted HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.97). There was no significant between-study heterogeneity in the analyses (all-cause mortality: I2=0.7%, P=0.389; CVD-specific mortality: I2=21.8%, P=0.280; cancer-specific mortality: I2=0.0%, P=0.918). Conclusions: The present meta-analysis confirmed that chili pepper intake could reduce the risk of all-cause, CVD-specific, and cancer-specific mortality, suggesting that chili pepper may be a beneficial ingredient in the diets in prolonging life.",

Several studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of amino acid (s) as a foliar spray on a variety of plant species. However, the effects of soil amendment of different concentrations of amino acid water-soluble fertilizer on the physiological characteristics, yield, and quality of pepper remain unclear. Following this, three experimental sets of amino acid water-soluble fertilizer in the ratio 1.8: 2.7: 3.6 kg including control (CK) were conducted in Lintao county, Gansu province. The treatments were applied through furrow method at 6 weeks after planting. The results showed that physiological characteristics of the pepper plants, such as chlorophyll a (1.35 mg g-1), and b (0.67 mg g-1), total chlorophyll (2.02 mg g-1), carotenoid (0.63 mg g-1), ETR (26.25 µmol m-2s-1), Fv/Fm (0.75), Qp (0.92) contents of the leaves were increased by the 1.8 kg treatment while NPQ (71.37%) and root activity (2185.52 µg g-1 h-1) were improved by the 3.6 kg treatment compared to the control. Fertilization with 2.7 kg of amino acid water-soluble fertilizer also had a significant influence on fruit length (25.50 cm), and yield of pepper (37.92 t ha-1) while fruit diameter (24.51 mm), firmness (5.30 kg cm-2), fresh (48.10 g) and dry (4.71 g) weights were higher in the 1.8 kg treatment compared to the control. The lowest rate of fertilizer (1.8 kg) applied again resulted in a significant increase in soluble protein (79.79%), capsaicin (5.80 mg g-1), dihydrocapsaicin (1.08 mg g-1), vitamin C (72.33%) and the essential and non-essential amino acid contents of the pepper which ranged from (235.15 to 11.16 µg g-1) and (1,605.10 to 16.63 µg g-1) respectively, while soluble sugar (9.02%) was enhanced by 3.6 kg treatment compared to the control. The findings suggest that soil amendment with low concentration of amino acid water-soluble fertilizer (1.8 kg) could be successfully used to improve the physiological characteristics and fruit quality of peppers in vegetable production."

Zinc (Zn) an essential micronutrient for plant growth, also increases resistance in plants against diseases, and also acts as an antifungal agent. Here, in vitro effects of ZnSO4 on the propagation of A. alternata were investigated, and also in vivo, the effect of foliar application of ZnSO4 was investigated in chili pepper plants under disease stress. In vitro, ZnSO4 inhibited fungal growth in a dose-dependent manner, with complete inhibition being observed at the concentration of 8.50 mM. Hyphae and conidial damage were observed along with abnormal activity of antioxidant enzymes, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the major changes in the protein structure of the fungal biomass after Zn accumulation. In vivo, pathogen infection caused the highest leaf spot disease incidence, and cumulative disease index, which resulted in a significant reduction in the plant's growth (length and biomass), and physiochemical traits (photosynthetic pigment, activity of catalase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase). The heat map and principal component analysis based on disease, growth and, physico-chemical variables generated useful information regarding the best treatment useful for disease management. Foliar Zn (0.036 mM) acted as a resistance inducer in chili pepper plants that improved activities of antioxidants (CAT and POX), and defense compounds (PPO and PAL), while managing 77% of disease. The study indicated foliar ZnSO4 as an effective and sustainable agriculture practice to manage Alternaria leaf spot disease in chili pepper plants."

A single ethephon treatment significantly increased L* and a* values and capsanthin concentration, while decreased total chlorophyll contents. Moreover, ethephon treatment induced significant promotion of capsaicin synthesis and reduction of soluble sugar content. While repeated treatments did not increase the total capsaicin content, and the consumption of soluble sugar was accelerated. Additionally, the maximum ethephon residue in chili pepper after ethephon treatment was 21.18 mg kg-1, which is lower than the permissible residue level of 50 mg kg-1 for chili peppers. The ethephon residual decreased with prolonging harvest time of chili peppers. The effects of ethephon treatment on different types of chili peppers were variable. The results of this study indicated that ethephon could hasten the ripening process and increase the quality of chili peppers."

Initial results show that the photocatalytic process's water maintains a pH and ion concentration within the allowed limits, significantly reducing the number of bacteria. Along the growth process, an influence on germination times, appearance of true leaves, maturation, and fruit production depending on the type of water used is observed, obtaining the best results in both growth times and quantity of fruits, for the 50% and 70% disinfected water/tap water (DW/TAW) study groups. Secondary metabolites, such as phenols, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity, were studied to evaluate changes in the vegetables' composition, showing increased concentration for the disinfected water groups in most specimens.

      "abstract": "It has been suggested that accumulation of flavonoids could be a key step in development of plant tolerance to different environmental stresses. Moreover, it has been recognized that abiotic stresses such as drought and UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) induce phenolic compound accumulation, suggesting a role for these compounds in drought tolerance. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of UV-B exposure on chili pepper (Capsicum annuum, cv. 'Coronel') plant performance, phenolic compound production, and gene expression associated with response to subsequent drought stress. Additionally, the phenotypic response to drought stress of these plants was studied. UV-B induced a reduction both in stem length, stem dry weight and number of floral primordia. The largest reduction in these variables was observed when combining UV-B and drought. UV-B-treated well-watered plants displayed fructification approximately 1 week earlier than non-UV-B-treated controls. Flavonoids measured epidermally in leaves significantly increased during UV-B treatment. Specifically, UV-B radiation significantly increased chlorogenic acid and apigenin 8-C-hexoside levels in leaves and a synergistic increase of luteolin 6-C-pentoside-8-C-hexoside was obtained by UV-B and subsequent drought stress. Gene expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS) genes also increased during UV-B treatments. On the other hand, expression of genes related to an oxidative response, such as mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and peroxidase (POD) was not induced by UV-B. Drought stress in UV-B-treated plants induced mitochondrial Mn-SOD gene expression. Taken together, the UV-B treatment did not induce significant tolerance in plants towards drought stress under the conditions used.",

During flower development hormonal treatments using gibberellins seem to promote growth resulting in higher yield and fruit quality. However, the morphological changes that occur in the pepper flowers after these treatments are largely unknown. In the present study, we provide a description of floral development landmarks of jalapeño chili pepper (cultivar Huichol), divided in nine representative stages from its initiation until the opening of the bud. We established a correlation among external flower development and the time and pattern of reproductive organogenesis. Male and female gametogenesis progression was used to define specific landmarks during flower maturation. The pattern of expression of key genes involved in gibberellin metabolism and response was also evaluated in the nine flower stages. The proposed development framework was used to analyze the effect of gibberellin treatments in the development of the flower. We observed both an effect of the treatment in the histology of the ovary tissue and an increase in the level of expression of CaGA2ox1 and CaGID1b genes. The developmental stages we defined for this species are very useful to analyze the molecular and morphological changes after hormonal treatments.",

Studies in humans, using a wide range of doses of chili intake (varying from a single meal to a continuous uptake for up to 12 weeks), concluded that it facilitates weight loss. In regard to this, the main targets of chili are fat metabolism, energy expenditure, and thermogenesis. To induce weight loss, the active substance of chili, capsaicin, activates Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel sub-family V member 1 (TRPV1) channels) receptors causing an increase in intracellular calcium levels and triggering the sympathetic nervous system. Apart from TRPV1, chili directly reduces energy expenditure by activating Brown Adipose Tissue. Weight loss by chili is also the result of an improved control of insulin, which supports weight management and has positive effects for treatment for diseases like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. This review summarizes the major pathways by which chili contributes to ameliorating parameters that help weight management and how the consumption of chili can help in accelerating weight loss through dietary modifications.",

      "abstract": "This is the first report that paromomycin, an antibiotic derived from Streptomyces sp. AG-P 1441 (AG-P 1441), controlled Phytophthora blight and soft rot diseases caused by Phytophthora capsici and Pectobacterium carotovorum, respectively, in chili pepper (Capsicum annum L.). Chili pepper plants treated with paromomycin by foliar spray or soil drenching 7 days prior to inoculation with P. capsici zoospores showed significant (p < 0.05) reduction in disease severity (%) when compared with untreated control plants. The disease severity of Phytophthora blight was recorded as 8% and 50% for foliar spray and soil drench, respectively, at 1.0 ppm of paromomycin, compared with untreated control, where disease severity was 83% and 100% by foliar spray and soil drench, respectively. A greater reduction of soft rot lesion areas per leaf disk was observed in treated plants using paromomycin (1.0 μg/ml) by infiltration or soil drench in comparison with untreated control plants. Paromomycin treatment did not negatively affect the growth of chili pepper. Furthermore, the treatment slightly promoted growth; this growth was supported by increased chlorophyll content in paromomycin-treated chili pepper plants. Additionally, paromomycin likely induced resistance as confirmed by the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes: PR-1, β-1,3-glucanase, chitinase, PR-4, peroxidase, and PR-10, which enhanced plant defense against P. capsici in chili pepper. This finding indicates that AG-P 1441 plays a role in pathogen resistance upon the activation of defense genes, by secretion of the plant resistance elicitor, paromomycin.",

This study was aimed to determine if consumption of chilies increases symptoms of acute anal fissures. METHODS: Individual patients were randomized to receive capsules containing chili or placebo for one week in addition to analgesics and fiber supplement. Patients were asked to note score for symptoms like pain, anal burning, and pruritus during the study period. After one week, cross over treatment was administered to the same group of patients with the same methodology and results were noted at the end of two weeks. RESULT: Fifty subjects were recruited for this study 43 of them completed the trial (22 in the chili group and 21 in the placebo group). The daily mean pain score was significantly lower in the placebo group in the study period. [Score 2.05 in chili group and 0.97 in placebo group, p<0.001]. There was a significant burning sensation experienced by the patients in the chili group (score 1.85 for the chili group vs. 0.71 for the placebo group, p<0.001). Patient's mean recorded improvement score was significantly higher after taking placebo. 81.3% patients preferred placebo while 13.9% preferred chilies. Two patients had no preference.

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Using cDNA microarray analysis, we isolated a cDNA clone, CaATL1 (Capsicum annuum L. Bukang AT-hook-Like gene 1), from a chili pepper plant incompatibly interacting with bacterial pathogens. The deduced amino acid sequence has a potential nuclear localization sequence and an AT-hook DNA binding motif which can bind AT-rich sequence elements. Expression of CaATL1 was specifically induced in host- and non-host-resistant responses against bacterial and viral pathogens in pepper plants. In addition, CaATL1 transcripts also increased following salicylic acid and ethephone treatment but were only mildly induced by methyl-jasmonate treatment. CaATL1::smGFP (soluble-modified green fluorescent protein) fusion protein localized to nuclei in tobacco BY2 protoplasts. The C-terminal region of the CaATL1 protein fused to the LexA DNA binding domain was able to activate reporter gene expression in yeast. To analyse further the role of the CaATL1 in pathogen defence response, we generated CaATL1-over-expressing transgenic tomato plants. These transgenic plants showed enhanced disease resistance against bacterial and oomycete pathogens. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence of a role for a plant AT-hook motif-containing transcription factor in pathogen defence response."

      "abstract": "WRKY family proteins are a class of plant-specific transcription factors involved in stress response signaling pathways. In this study a gene encoding a putative WRKY protein was isolated from a pepper EST database (http://genepool.kribb.re.kr). The cDNA, named Capsicum annuum WRKY2 (CaWRKY2), encodes a putative polypeptide of 548 amino acids, containing two WRKY domains with zinc finger motifs and two potential nuclear localization signals. Northern blot analyses showed that CaWRKY2 mRNA was preferentially induced during incompatible interactions of pepper plants with PMMoV, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61, and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria race 3. Furthermore, CaWRKY2 transcripts were strongly induced by wounding and ethephon treatment, whereas only moderate expression was detected following treatment with salicylic acid and jasmonic acid. CaWRKY2 was translocated to the nucleus when a CaWRKY2-smGFP fusion construct was expressed in onion epidermal cells. CaWRKY2 also had transcriptional activation activity in yeast. Taken together our data suggest that CaWRKY2 is a pathogen-inducible transcription factor that may have a role in early defense responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.",

In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we have studied the effects of a single dose of red hot chili pepper on the hemorrhoidal symptoms. METHODS: Fifty patients with second-degree and third-degree symptomatic hemorrhoids were randomly assigned to take a capsule containing red hot chili powder or placebo during lunch, scoring five hemorrhoidal symptoms (bleeding, swelling, pain, itching, and burning) on a visual analog scale. After one week, crossover treatment was administered according to the same methodology. Other treatments and foods potentially related with anorectal symptoms were discontinued during the study periods. RESULTS: Patients assigned low scores to their hemorrhoidal symptoms before the study and the scores remained unchanged during the 48 hours after both placebo and chili pepper treatment, the latter showing no statistically significant effects. CONCLUSIONS: There is no scientific evidence that a spicy meal based on red hot chili pepper may worsen hemorrhoidal symptoms and, therefore, there is no reason to prevent these patients from occasionally enjoying a spicy dish if they so wish.",
