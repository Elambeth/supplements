      "abstract": "Background. Students often face high levels of mental distress, which can adversely affect their academic performance and overall wellbeing. While forest bathing, as a nature-based solution (NBS), has recognized benefits for mental wellbeing, its specific impact on undergraduate students remains understudied. Purpose. This research brief aims to present the insights and lessons learned from a pilot study utilizing a five-step forest bathing protocol applied to higher education students. Method. A semester-long intervention study was conducted in natural urban parks in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil. Thirty-six newly enrolled university students participated in three NBS sessions, with data collected before and after each intervention using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. The interventions were spaced approximately one month apart. For the paired comparison between repeated measurements, one-tailed tests were used based on Student's t-test, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results: The protocol had significant and substantial effects on reducing anxiety (48.4%, dCohen = 0.415), depression (35.4%, dCohen = 0.431), and stress (33.5%, dCohen = 0.479) in participants, particularly after visiting parks with a higher degree of naturalness. Insights and Lessons Learned. The pilot study highlighted the critical role of naturalness in the effectiveness of forest bathing interventions. Parks with more natural elements provided greater reductions in mental distress, supporting theories such as attention restoration theory. Additionally, the findings suggest that integrating NBS programs into university settings can significantly enhance student mental wellbeing and emotional stability. The nuanced responses to different environmental settings underscore the need for well-designed green spaces in academic environments. These insights can inform the design and implementation of green spaces within universities, contributing to improved mental health outcomes for students.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been reported that forest bathing significantly reduced negative emotions and increased the positive feelings in both healthy males and females, as well as increasing blood serotonin in healthy males, indicating the potential for a beneficial effect on depressive status. However, an improvement effect of forest bathing on participants with depression has not been reported so far. Therefore, in order to fill this gap, this study examined the effect of forest bathing on depression in female participants with depression/depressive tendencies. METHODS: Thirty-one females aged 40.1 ± 2.4 years with depression/depressive tendencies were recruited after obtaining informed consent. The study employed a randomized crossover design to compare forest bathing with city walking. They participated in day trips to a Japanese cypress forest park and to a city area of Nagano Prefecture as a control in June 2023. On both trips, they walked 2.5 km (for 90 min) in the morning and afternoon, respectively, for a total of 5.0 km per day. Blood samples were taken at 4 pm for the measurements before forest bathing on the first day and after the walking in forest and unban sites on the second and third days, at the same hospital. Concentrations of oxytocin, IGF-1, serotonin and lactic acid in blood were measured. SDS scores were calculated and the POMS test and questionnaires for subjective fatigue symptoms and sleep quality were administered before and after each trip. Temperature, humidity and illuminance were also measured in the forest and urban environments. The Nippon Medical School Central Ethics Committee approved this study. RESULTS: Forest bathing significantly decreased SDS scores compared to city walk and the baseline, and the effect lasted for one week after forest bathing. Forest bathing also significantly increased the concentrations of blood serotonin in participants who were not taking antidepressants, significantly increased the levels of oxytocin and IGF-1 in blood, significantly increased the scores for positive feelings, and reduced the scores for negative emotions compared with city walking in the POMS test. In addition, forest bathing reduced subjective fatigue symptoms and improved sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provided scientific evidence to contribute to understanding forest bathing as a potential intervention for preventing depression, and future research on males should further explore these effects."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The fast pace of modem life brings great pressure, which lead to physical and mental health issues. Researches have demonstrated that forest bathing can considerably alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety, eliminate negative emotions and promote mental wellbeing. We presented evidences of the positive impact of forest bathing on mental health in the context rapid urbanization and surging health needs in the post-pandemic era, and outlined the current insights into the related factors affecting the effect of forest bathing, as to provide directions for future interventions or research. METHOD: The electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science Core Collections and the China Academic Journals (CAJ) offered through the Full-text Database (CNKI) were searched for relevant studies published from the inception of the databases to December 2024. The initial search strategy was performed using keywords, MeSH terms, and free text words such as \"forest bathing\", \"forest medicine\", \"mental health pressure\", \"anxiety\", \"depression\", \"cortisol\", etc. RESULTS: The synthesis of the findings in the included studies revealed that forest bathing interventions might improve mental and physical health, reduce blood pressure, improve sleep quality and boost immunity, as well as alleviate depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, the effect of forest bathing on mental health indicators and the differences in these results among different populations varied. Forest environment, tree species, exposure duration, season, composition and concentration of volatile organic compounds have an impact on the effect of forest bathing. CONCLUSIONS: Forest bathing were effective in lowering cortisol levels, reducing sympathetic nerve activity, as well as improving negative mood, which could serve as a non-pharmacological treatment for mental health in the general population.",

      "abstract": "AIM: This study aims to explore the physiological effect of forest bathing on stress management. METHODS: A total of 29 volunteers participated in this pre-post design, which lacked a control group. Several physiological parameters were recorded, including heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), blood pressure (BP), immunoglobulin A (IGA), and salivary cortisol (sCort). Additionally, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was administered before forest exposure. Measurements were taken before and after participants spent 2 days fully immersed in a forest environment. To further assess stress management, participants completed a Mental Arithmetic Task (MAT) before and after forest immersion, during which EDA, HRV, and HR were monitored using an Empatica E4 wristband. Measurements were taken at baseline, during MAT, and afterward (recovery). RESULTS: Participants exhibited moderate perceived stress levels before forest immersion (mean PSS-10 = 21.22, SD = 3.78). Post-forest exposure, there was a significant decrease in sCort (p < 0.05) and EDA (p < 0.001), while HRV increased (p < 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure rose (p < 0.05). ANOVA results from the MAT showed a significant increase in parasympathetic activity across all conditions post-immersion (p < 0.05), except during recovery, while EDA decreased in all conditions post-forest exposure (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Shinrin-yoku significantly improved stress management at a physiological level and could be a valuable intervention for individuals experiencing stress. However, longitudinal studies with a control group are necessary to determine whether these effects are sustained over time. Nonetheless, this study highlights the potential benefits of forest immersion for stress reduction by enhancing sympathovagal balance and the adaptability of the stress response system."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This Scoping review (ScR) builds upon the 2017 review conducted by Hansen et al which contributed to evidence base shinrin-yoku (SY), also known as forest bathing (FB), has many positive health effects and is becoming a prescribed dose (specific time spent in nature) by health care providers. Practice and research regarding SY, has been historically based in Asian countries with a recent increase in Europe. The need and call for more research worldwide continues to further the evidence of SY as a health promotion modality. Through this ScR the authors identified programmatic components, health information monitored and screened, time spent in nature, geographical regions, trends, and themes in SY research worldwide. METHODS: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines we searched across 7 electronic databases for SY or FB research articles from 2017 through 2022. PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, Embase, JSTOR were included due to the interdisciplinary nature of SY or FB research. Each database provided unique strengths ensuring a capture of a wide range of articles. The resulting articles were screened and extracted through Covidence. RESULTS: Database searches returned 241 results, with 110 references removed during the deduplication process, 131 were initially screened in the title and abstract review stage. Resulting in 82 unique results deemed relevant and screened in full text. During the final stage of the review, 63 articles met all inclusion criteria and were extracted for data. CONCLUSIONS: The practice of SY has physiological (PHYS) and psychological (PSYCH) benefits across age groups. Research findings indicate either the natural or the virtual environment (VW) has significant health benefits. Continued research is encouraged globally for short- and long-term health outcomes for all individuals. The connection with nature benefits the mind, body and soul and is supported by Henry David Thoreau's philosophy: \"Our livesneed the relief of where the pine flourishes and the jay still scream.\""

      "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated that practicing forest bathing has significant positive effects on adult psychological well-being. Considering the ongoing adolescents' mental health crisis of increasing anxiety and depression, determining whether forest bathing has similar effects on adolescents is an important expansion of forest bathing research. This study investigated the possibility that forest bathing could improve adolescents' mental well-being and sought to determine participants' experiences of forest bathing. It used a convergent, parallel, mixed-methods design that was partially co-created with 24 participants aged 16-18 as part of a youth participatory action research (YPAR) project in which participants practiced forest bathing three times over 3 weeks. As measured using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Survey, the mean participant mental well-being increased significantly after forest bathing, with moderate to large effect sizes. Participants described reduced stress and increased feelings of relaxation, peace, and happiness. These findings correlate with previous forest bathing research involving adult participants. It is recommended that educators and others who work with adolescents consider forest bathing as a simple, low-cost way to improve adolescents' mental well-being.",

Shinrin-Yoku (Forest Bathing), a practice involving spending time in a forested environment while paying attention to multi-sensory stimuli has been proposed as one such modality. The objectives of this review were to critically analyse the current evidence base on the efficacy of Shinrin-Yoku for the treatment of depression, and to examine how the findings may reflect and/or inform osteopathic principles and clinical practice. An integrative review of the evidence for Shinrin-Yoku in the management of depression published between 2009 and 2019 was conducted resulting in n = 13 peer-reviewed studies meeting inclusion criteria. Two themes emerged from the literature, the positive effect of Shinrin-Yoku on self-reported mood scores, and physiological changes arising from forest exposure. However, the methodological quality of the evidence is poor and experiments may not be generalisable. Suggestions were made for improving the research base via mixed-method studies in a biopsychosocial framework, and aspects of the research which may be applicable to evidence-based osteopathy were noted.",

      "abstract": "Physical rehabilitation plays a fundamental role in the management of individuals with disabilities associated with age-related muscle loss or affected by catastrophic conditions such as trauma, surgery, cancer or other severe pathologies. These events have in common an extended period of physical inactivity. Patients who undergo prolonged bed rest often present with a number of complications; for example, muscle loss that can exacerbate existing conditions determined by sarcopenia, which in turn greatly limits physical functions. The main scope of this work is to summarize certain key strategies for the physiotherapeutic management of physically inactive patients, regardless of the reason behind their prolonged bed rest, with a particular focus on physical rehabilitation, nutrition and forest-bathing. The importance of correct nutrition in counter-acting the loss of muscle mass and consequent function is explored alongside a description of the main nutrients that are needed for muscle regeneration. From a biomolecular perspective, some specific molecular mechanisms associated with physical rehabilitation are also reported not only in the context of physical therapy, but also within nature-inspired techniques, such as forest-bathing as well as body self-healing. Combining a targeted physiotherapeutic approach with an appropriate diet as well as nature-based therapy could thus help with the recovery of bed ridden patients.",

However, there is less research assessing whether adolescents benefit from formal nature connection interventions such as forest bathing (slow mindful nature walks). This research aimed to assess whether an urban nature connection intervention (called ParkBathe) could improve adolescents' nature connection and wellbeing. METHOD: In an experimental repeated measures design, 44 adolescents sampled opportunistically from Scouts groups, completed surveys and interviews before and after experiencing an urban nature connection intervention. RESULTS: Paired-samples t-tests between baseline and post-intervention survey scores revealed statistically significant improvements in anxiety (13% reduction); rumination (44% reduction); scepticism (17% reduction); nature connection (25% increase); and social connection (12% increase). The largest effect size was found for nature connection. Interviews revealed that before the session, participants had a mixed understanding and expectations of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: After the session, the participants expressed enjoying the social aspects of being part of a group and being present in the moment by noticing nature. They expressed the effects of this as immediately calming and relaxing. Urban forest bathing improved nature connection and wellbeing in adolescents and could be implemented and/or signposted by schools and youth charities.",

Forest bathing has been demonstrated to improve physical and mental outcomes but there is no evidence in Long-COVID patients. Accordingly, this pilot study sought to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of online forest bathing in adults with Long-COVID. METHODS: Feasibility was assessed by monitoring retention rates and participant feedback. In a waitlist controlled, repeated measures design, 22 Long-COVID patients completed weekly online surveys during a four-week waitlist control period, before engaging in four weekly online forest bathing sessions, completing post-intervention surveys following each session. RESULTS: In terms of retention, 27% did not provide post-intervention data, reasons for non-adherence were: feeling too ill, having medical appointments, or having career responsibilities. Compared with the waitlist control period, there were statistically significant improvements in Anxiety (49% decrease), Rumination (48% decrease), Social Connection (78% increase), and Long-COVID symptoms (22% decrease). Written qualitative comments indicated that participants experienced feelings of calm and joy, felt more connected socially and with nature, and experienced a break from the pain and rumination surrounding their illness. CONCLUSIONS: Online Forest bathing resulted in significant improvements in well-being and symptom severity and could be considered an accessible and inexpensive adjunct therapy for Long-COVID patients. Where people have limited access to in-person nature, virtual nature may offer an alternative to improve health and well-being outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Professional healthcare worker burnout is a crisis in the United States healthcare system. This crisis can be viewed at any level, from the national to local communities, but ultimately, must be understood at the level of the individual who is caring for patients. Thus, interventions to reduce burnout symptoms must prioritize the mental health of these individuals by alleviating some of the symptoms of depression, grief, and anxiety that accompany burnout. The practice of Shinrin-Yoku (Forest Bathing) is a specific evidence-based practice which research has shown can improve an individual's mental health and, when performed in a group, can support a sense of social connection. We investigated the impact of a three-hour, guided Shinrin-Yoku (Forest Bathing) nature-based intervention on burnout symptoms among physicians and other healthcare workers by using a randomized, controlled trial. The Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Mini-Z assessments were used to collect baseline burnout scores and participants were randomized into the intervention group, which completed the assessment again after the Shinrin-Yoku walk, or into a control group, which completed the assessments again after a day off from any clinical duties. A total of 34 participants were enrolled in the intervention group and a total of 22 participants were enrolled in the control group. Ultimately, no statistically significant differences were detected between the pre-test and post-test scores for the intervention group or between the post-test scores of the intervention group compared to the control group. However, the subjective responses collected from participants after participating in the Shinrin-Yoku walk overwhelmingly reported decreased feelings of stress and increased mental wellbeing. This raises important questions about the difference between symptoms of burnout and other aspects of mental health, as well as the limitations of a one-time nature-based intervention on levels of chronic burnout symptoms. Thus, further research on the effects of engaging healthcare providers in an ongoing practice of Shinrin-Yoku is warranted.",

A growing number of published studies provide evidence of such effects in diverse populations and contexts. However, no literature has been found that evaluates the effects of forest bathing on people with intellectual disabilities. In this paper, we present a quasi-experimental pre-post protocol for assessing the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of a forest bathing intervention in a group of adults with intellectual disability. An 11-weekly session program will be applied in the forests of the Ollo Valley, Navarre (Spain). The preliminary efficacy outcomes will be blood pressure, psycho-physiological coherence parameters and quality of life. The feasibility of the intervention will be assessed through data on barriers and facilitators of the implementation process and indicators of environmental comfort (physiological equivalent temperature and thermic perception). This study offers an opportunity for people with intellectual disabilities to benefit from a forest bathing intervention and explore its effects not only on their quality of life, but also on the improvement in their physiological and psychological state. This feasibility study is an essential step to explore crucial aspects for a future full-scale trial.",

      "abstract": "Strengthening the immune system in order to better withstand the threat of COVID-19 is an important way to ensure the protection of our health against the current pandemic associated with SARS-CoV-2. There are many ways to achieve this, but with current circumstances, certain modalities stand out as being the most valid and are certainly worth greater consideration. Here we review the effects that particular immuno-strengthening activities can have on limiting the severity of COVID-19 disease as well as preventing virus infection. Physical activity, in particular, should not be discounted as an important method of prevention of viral diseases as it triggers many biological processes within the human body which in turn lead to heightened natural defences against viral infections. When exercise is performed in forested areas, these protective health benefits may be increased since many plant species emit biogenic volatile compounds (VOCs) which, when inhaled, have many protective properties. These VOCs have been shown in particular to have immunostimulatory effects on the human body and, thus, they could be of use in the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. Being amongst trees may also help to alleviate stress and anxiety, lowering cortisol levels and consequently helping the proper functioning of the immune system. In the following work, we have performed an analysis of the available scientific literature which looks at the effects of physical exercise as well as 'forest-bathing' on the immune system's ability to fight disease, especially of course as it relates to COVID-19. Our review aims at shedding light on the benefits of exercising outdoors in green areas and suggests reforestation as a protective measure against future outbreaks."

      "abstract": "Various formats of forest bathing have been receiving increasing attention owing to their perspectives in health promotion and the treatment of chronic lifestyle diseases. The majority of field studies are still being conducted in the Far Eastern region, and they often make psychological assessments mainly in the green season. In our pretest-posttest field experiment, twelve healthy, working-age volunteers participated in a 2-h leisurely forest walking program, first in the green season (May) and then in the winter season (January), in the Mecsek Hills, next to Pécs, Hungary. Systolic blood pressure decreased after the trips both in late spring and in the winter. Based on changes in the expressions of CD69, an early activation marker, NKG2D, a major recognition receptor, perforin, granzyme B, and TIM-3, an inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule, on CD8+ cytotoxic T, NK, NKdim, NKbright, and NKT cells, we detected the stimulation of NKbright cells and activation of all examined immune cell subsets in the green season. In the winter, a slight activating and an interesting balancing effect regarding TIM-3 could be observed considering our finding that basal (pretest) TIM-3 expression by NK cells was significantly lower in the winter. Our work expands the knowledge on and potentials of forest medicine.",

Practitioners can choose whatever they like to focus on in the forest: different colours of leaves, the sounds of streams, or the warmth of sunshine beaming between leaves. Since the birth of this practice in 1982, shinrin-yoku has been widely used in the Japanese clinical fields (Hansen, Jones, & Tocchini, 2017). Recently, this healing practice has received attention from healthcare practitioners and researchers worldwide (Wen, Yan, Pan, Gu, & Liu, 2019). In this commentary, we will discuss limitations of the current shinrin-yoku research, and how future research can be conducted to appraise the effects of shinrin-yoku on addiction.",

The electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsyINFO, and the China Academic Journals (CAJ) offered through the Full-text Database (CNKI) were searched for relevant studies published from the inception of the databases to April 2019. Of the 364 articles that were identified, 14 met the criteria for inclusion in this review. The synthesis of the findings in the included studies revealed that forest bathing interventions were effective at reducing blood pressure, lowering pulse rate, increasing the power of heart rate variability (HRV), improving cardiac-pulmonary parameters, and metabolic function, inducing a positive mood, reducing anxiety levels, and improving the quality of life of pre-hypertensive or hypertensive participants. Forest walking and forest therapy programs were the two most effective forest bathing interventions. Studies reported that practicing a single forest walking or forest therapy program can produce short-term physiological and psychological benefits. It is concluded that forest bathing, particularly forest walking and therapy, has physiologically and psychologically relaxing effects on middle-aged and elderly people with pre-hypertension and hypertension.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, many of Japanese workers have complained of fatigue and stress, considering them as risk factors for depression. Studies have found that \"forest bathing\" (Shinrin-yoku) has positive physiological effects, such as blood pressure reduction, improvement of autonomic and immune functions, as well as psychological effects of alleviating depression and improving mental health. In this study, we investigate the physiological and psychological effects of \"forest bathing\" on people of a working age with and without depressive tendencies. METHODS: We conducted physiological measurements and psychological surveys before and after forest bathing with subjects who participated in day-long sessions of forest bathing, at a forest therapy base located in Hiroshima Prefecture. After excluding severely depressed individuals, the participants were classified into two groups: those with depressive tendencies (5 ≤ K6 ≤ 12) and those without depressive tendencies (K6 < 5) for comparative study. The evaluation indices measured were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse rate (PR), autonomic functions, and profile of mood states (POMS). RESULTS: Of the 155 participants, 37% had depressive tendencies, without any differences observed between males and females. All participants showed significant decrease in SBP, DBP, and in negative POMS items after a forest bathing session. Before the session, those with depressive tendencies scored significantly higher on the POMS negative items than those without depressive tendencies. After forest bathing, those with depressive tendencies demonstrated significantly greater improvement in many of POMS items than those without depressive tendencies, and many of them no longer differed between those with and without depressive tendencies. CONCLUSIONS: Examining the physiological and psychological effects of a day-long session of forest bathing on a working age group demonstrated significant positive effects on mental health, especially in those with depressive tendencies.

The quality of included trials was assessed following the criteria of the NIH dedicated tools. Afterwards, a qualitative and quantitative synthesis of retrieved evidence was performed. A total of 971 articles were screened; 22 of them were included in the systematic review and 8 in the meta-analysis. In all but two included studies, cortisol levels were significantly lower after intervention in forest groups if compared with control/comparison groups, or a significant pre-post reduction of cortisol levels was reported in the forest groups. The main results of the meta-analysis showed that salivary cortisol levels were significantly lower in the forest groups compared with the urban groups both before (MD = - 0.08 μg/dl [95% CI - 0.11 to - 0.05 μg/dl]; p < 0.01; I2 = 46%) and after intervention (MD = - 0.05 μg/dl [95% CI - 0.06 to - 0.04 μg/dl]; p < 0.01; I2 = 88%). Overall, forest bathing can significantly influence cortisol levels on a short term in such a way as to reduce stress, and anticipated placebo effects can play an important role in it.

The aim of this state-of-the-art review is to elucidate empirical research conducted on the physiological and psychological effects of Shinrin-Yoku (or Forest Bathing) in transcontinental Japan and China. Furthermore, we aim to encourage healthcare professionals to conduct longitudinal research in Western cultures regarding the clinically therapeutic effects of Shinrin-Yoku and, for healthcare providers/students to consider practicing Shinrin-Yoku to decrease undue stress and potential burnout. METHODS: A thorough review was conducted to identify research published with an initial open date range and then narrowing the collection to include papers published from 2007 to 2017. Electronic databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Scopus) and snowball references were used to cull papers that evaluated the use of Shinrin-Yoku for various populations in diverse settings. RESULTS: From the 127 papers initially culled using the Boolean phrases: \"Shinrin-yoku\" AND/OR \"forest bathing\" AND/OR \"nature therapy\", 64 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this summary review and then divided into \"physiological,\" \"psychological,\" \"sensory metrics\" and \"frameworks\" sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS: Human health benefits associated with the immersion in nature continue to be currently researched. Longitudinal research, conducted worldwide, is needed to produce new evidence of the relationships associated with Shinrin-Yoku and clinical therapeutic effects. Nature therapy as a health-promotion method and potential universal health model is implicated for the reduction of reported modern-day \"stress-state\" and \"technostress.\".",

Two groups of participants with CHF were simultaneously sent to the forest or an urban control area for a four-day trip, respectively. Subjects exposed to the forest site showed a significant reduction of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in comparison to that of the city group and their own baseline levels. The values for the cardiovascular disease related pathological factors, including endothelin-1 (ET-1), and constituents of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including renin, angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin II (ANGII), and ANGII receptor type 1 or 2 (AT1 or AT2) in subjects exposed to the forest environment were lower than those in the urban control group. Obviously, a decreased level of inflammatory cytokines and improved antioxidant function was observed in the forest group rather than in the city group. The assessment of the profile of mood states (POMS) indicated that the negative emotional mood state was alleviated after forest bathing. As anticipated, a better air quality in the forest site was observed according to the detection of PM2.5 (particulate matter <2.5 μm) and negative ions. These results provided direct evidence that forest bathing has a beneficial effect on CHF patients, and thus may pave the way for potential development of forest bathing as an effective adjunctive therapy on cardiovascular disorders.",

Visual analog scale (VAS) on one day, VAS over the previous week, neck disability index (NDI), EuroQol 5D-3L VAS (EQ VAS) and index (EQ index), McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ), the number of trigger points in the posterior neck region (TRPs), and the range of motion of the cervical spine were evaluated on the first and last day of the program and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The number of TRPs were significantly reduced in the FBE group compared with the FBA group (p=0.013). However, the other scales showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: When patients with chronic posterior neck pain underwent a short-term forest bathing (less than 7 days) program, FBE was more effective in the reduction of the number of TRPs than FBA. However, all other pain measurement scales we evaluated showed no statistically significant difference between the two protocols."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To provide scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of forest bathing as a natural therapy for human hypertension. METHODS: Twenty-four elderly patients with essential hypertension were randomly divided into two groups of 12. One group was sent to a broad-leaved evergreen forest to experience a 7-day/7-night trip, and the other was sent to a city area in Hangzhou for control. Blood pressure indicators, cardiovascular disease-related pathological factors including endothelin-1, homocysteine, renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin II, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, angiotensin II type 2 receptor as well as inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α were detected. Meanwhile, profile of mood states (POMS) evaluation was used to assess the change of mood state of subjects. In addition, the air quality in the two experimental sites was monitored during the 7-day duration, simultaneously. RESULTS: The baselines of the indicators of the subjects were not significantly different. Little alteration in the detected indicators in the city group was observed after the experiment. While subjects exposed to the forest environment showed a significant reduction in blood pressure in comparison to that of the city group. The values for the bio-indicators in subjects exposed to the forest environment were also lower than those in the urban control group and the baseline levels of themselves. POMS evaluation showed that the scores in the negative subscales were lowered after exposure to the forest environment. Besides, the air quality in the forest environment was much better than that of the urban area evidenced by the quantitative detection of negative ions and PM10 (particulate matter < 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter). CONCLUSION: Our results provided direct evidence that forest bathing has therapeutic effects on human hypertension and induces inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and inflammation, and thus inspiring its preventive efficacy against cardiovascular disorders.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To provide scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of forest bathing as a natural therapy by investigating its physiological benefits using biological indicators in outdoor settings. STUDY DESIGN: Within-group comparisons were used to examine psychological and physiological responses to exposure to real forest and urban environments. METHODS: Young Japanese male adults participated in a 3-day, 2-night field experiment. Physiological responses as well as self-reported psychological responses to forest and urban environmental stimuli were measured in real settings. The results of each indicator were compared against each environmental stimulus. RESULTS: Heart rate variability analysis indicated that the forest environment significantly increased parasympathetic nervous activity and significantly suppressed sympathetic activity of participants compared with the urban environment. Salivary cortisol level and pulse rate decreased markedly in the forest setting compared with the urban setting. In psychological tests, forest bathing significantly increased scores of positive feelings and significantly decreased scores of negative feelings after stimuli compared with the urban stimuli. CONCLUSION: Physiological data from this field experiment provide important scientific evidence on the health benefits of forest bathing. The results support the concept that forest bathing has positive effects on physical and mental health, indicating that it can be effective for health promotion. Despite the small sample size in this study, a very clear tendency towards positive physiological and psychological outcomes in forests was observed.",
